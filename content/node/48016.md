  I add a point. In fog, that point is now active, and I can edit it directly.\r\n\r\n3.
  For some reason Flab seems to like to have a different point be active. Why? \r\n\r\n4.
  The tools toolbar seems to disappear at random. Why? \r\n\r\n5. In another thread,
  Nick Shinn I think indicated that Flab is very difficult to work with unless you
  are sitting six inches away from the screen. Most of us are working on high-res
  screens nowadays, but Flab seems to be designed -- still -- for use at 800x600.
  \r\n\r\nWe need to sit 18-36 inches away from our screens. The further, the better
  for us. It's time for everything in Flab to be visible from that distance on a 17\"
  1920x1200 monitor. Otherwise it's too much of an ergonomic liability."

    very true. I find that changing many of the default colors helps, but I feel like
    I\u2019m going to go blind staring at Fontlab!\r\n\r\nedit: \r\nOn that note,
    the default colors for masks and components\u2014among other things\u2014are too
    similar. I often find that the colors in Fontlab are just too light all around,
    and that the software is easier to use when I crank up the colors and turn off
    whatever layers I\u2019m not currently working with."

  body: "Another one: in most software the \u201Csave as\u201D feature defaults to
    saving into the same directory as the open file. Fontlab saves the new file in
    the last directory any file was saved to. I do a lot of incremental saves, and
    I can\u2019t tell you how often I\u2019ve ended up with a file in the wrong place
    because I\u2019m used to \u201Csave as\u201D working differently in almost every
    other app."

  body: "Those are both great points. I hadn't realized until you wrote just how difficult
    I find the points and most especially the handles to see. \r\n\r\nI'd also like
    more than one background layer. Let's say, numbered layers up to ten? (I can't
    imagine using more than three or four but you never know.)\r\n\r\nAnd now that
    basic 1990 MM support is almost perfect, let's go through hell for a few years
    by making it more advanced? Erik van Blokland predicted that Superpolator would
    be somehow included in Fontlab the minute he released it, and he doubled his chances
    of this happening by refusing to license it to Fontlab, where it belongs. I'm
    sure we all hope that Yuri is busily figuring all this out. Let's actualize Erik's
    paranoia. It'll be fun! And then it won't be paranoia anymore -- we can pronounce
    the patient cured!\r\n\r\nJames, regarding the perils of Flab save as, another
    problem is that if you lose track of the folder you did happen to save a file
    into, it can be very difficult to learn from Fontlab where that folder is, especially
    if the path is long."

    question you can no doubt answer. \r\n\r\nAges ago I was taught that characters
    such as space and nbspace should have a single corner point at the 0,0 position.
    Fontlab complains about this in generate options -- that it's an open contour
    it cannot be exported as open. \r\n\r\nWhat's the best practice today? Continue
    with the point and ignore the warning, or just leave out the point, or something

    -- probably a year or more ago -- I had from Fontlab directly was to use blend.
    That was when other solutions weren't working.\r\n\r\nHowever, here, I don't want
    to create an MM. I just want to have two extremes open and create a variation
    that a designer has requested. \r\n\r\nI'm afraid to create a new MM (or use the
    existing one) because how do I know -- if 'blend' doesn't work -- that Fontlab's
    export of an instance will work? \r\n\r\nIn this limited situation, what's the
    best thing to do? I could of course do it in Fog, and know exactly what was going
    to happen. But then I would lose my limited OT feature set which I'd rather not
    subsequently rebuild. However, I can do that if necessary."

    here\u2019s another: I often can\u2019t see numbers in Fontlab because they\u2019re

    goes for the tiny number under the mouse cursor when kerning in the metrics interface.

    window they need to pop up farther down and inside a circle or something that

  body: There is a sort of session save feature, although probably more meager than
    what you're looking for. If you open the Fonts panel, there is a "save project"
    button. This will save a list of the currently open fonts and the positions of
    the Font windows, which you can then open later to open the same fonts together.
