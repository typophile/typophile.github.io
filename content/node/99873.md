body: "Hey people, this is \"my\" (well not really mine, it's just a vectorization)
  first font! \r\n\r\nI decided to revive this after I saw some sketches of the 'universal
  alphabet' and discovered the digital versions were just cleaned versions of his
  wood-type printings... but as they were tests they had small imperfections (like
  bad curves etc) that when vectorized and look worse when we use them on bigger sizes.\r\n\r\nHere's
  the three wheights I made based on his prints (only the A, full character set on
  PDF):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a wheight comparison_6014.jpg]\r\n\r\nAh!
  I'm making this inspired by the old Multiple Masters technology so I used the same
  number of nodes in all characters so they are blendable to make an infinite number
  of wheights! No numbers yet.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blend_6535.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  don't really know if this is releasable/sellable but the most important thing is
  the knowledge I've acquired during the process and the perfect preservation of the
  letterforms digitally!\r\n\r\nAlso, on the grid studies I used auto-trace on very
  high-res pictures I scanned and compared to my version!\r\n\r\nPlease, guys, criticize
  specially the lighter wheights on the PDF attachment (I forgot the W but it's just
  an upside-down M in this haha)\r\n"

  body: "When I hear \"ultra-accurate revival\", I have to worry... :-)  So many things
    have changed since then (like paper quality) that to me at least it's impossible
    to have enough faith in such a process.\r\n\r\nA more practical problem though
    is that you're trying to revive something that was constructed geometrically,
    with no apparent regard for some necessary subtleties. Quick examples: vertical
    elements should be thicker than horizontal ones (to appear the same), curves need
    to be thicker than straights (to appear the same), curves need to overshoot the
    guidelines (otherwise they look shorter)... All kinds of stuff like that, which
    makes or breaks a font in terms of usability.\r\n\r\nNow, if the whole point is
    to play s\xE9ance :-) with Bayer I guess you're doing fine. Although then I would
    have to ask: what's with these multiple weights?\r\n\r\nAs for distributing such
    fonts: I'm pretty sure you're OK. Unless maybe Bayer's estate made an exclusivity
    deal with The Foundry*. But I doubt it.\r\n\r\n* See for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architype_Bayer\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>When I hear \"ultra-accurate revival\", I have to worry... :-)</blockquote>\r\nI
    know what you mean and agree completely. I just decided to post this here because
    of what I can't see as a begginner! I don't have an 'ultra accurate revival'...
    yet :) so I wanted to know what do typographers think about it, because knowing
    different points of view is always better than working alone... In GRID STUDIES
    file I tried to 'retrace' the original grid from sketches of a pre-universal font
    featured on Ellen Lupton's 'ABCs of Bauhaus'. They fitted well (please, open the
    PDF with adobe reader so you can see the guidelines and the grid), his prints
    are on the right.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A more practical problem though is that you're
    trying to revive something that was constructed geometrically, with no apparent
    regard for some necessary subtleties. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes, that's a problem
    I've encountered already: commas and most of accents looking too heavy, dots too
    small, all curves appear to float a bit on the baseline on smaller sizes, 'e'
    and 's' too dark... Although those problems get very minimal on large display
    sizes >48pt.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Although then I would have to ask: what's with
    these multiple weights?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell I had that idea because it was
    easier to create the 'middle' wheight (I had drawn just the Bold and Light ones)
    but it appears to be useful as 'adding' things would make this more useful too
    and wouldn't 'change' the faithfullness! Like the italics of garamond we have
    today, they were added but the original romans are there more or less intact!
    For reference the 'Blippo Black-style S' was added by me because it produces a
    more even color when printing, though, it's only an alternate, the original parts
    won't have any alteration! (I've made another e that is better on text too but
    forgot to include it here).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>As for distributing such fonts:
    I'm pretty sure you're OK. Unless maybe Bayer's estate made an exclusivity deal
    with The Foundry*.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm going to contact them after I finish
    this, as they've authorized this set in 1997: \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/bayer-universal/\r\n\r\nThough
    it falls into what I mentioned previously: wonky outlines because it's a vectorization
    of the wood type prints...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* See for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architype_Bayer</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    know that! Where did you think I've got inspiration for that & from? ...shssh!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments, Hrant :D"
