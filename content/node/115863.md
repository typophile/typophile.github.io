  body: "It has a strong resemblance to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/light-classic-roman/|Classic
    Roman]],  although the legs on the K are not quite the same. The serifs are small
    to begin with, and may not be relevant if this was drawn with the typeface as
    a model.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike mentions \"drawn.\" AFAIK this was indeed the method used to make quality
    business cards until relatively recently. The drawing was in the form of engraving.
    This may be explained in part by the fact that very thin typefaces were subject
    to damage during the metal-type era. BTW, I agree with Mike that Monotype's Classic
    Roman is a good choice for a substitute. If you want a closer approximation, you
    could copy the sweeping leg on _R_ to _K_.\r\nDon\r\n"
