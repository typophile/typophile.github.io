    corner in the counter of o in the light (more like it is in the b now). I think
    I was trying too hard to get it almost monoline in that weight, and keeping that
    interpolatable with the *black* weight has made for some lumpy looking strokes
    in certain glyphs. Hrant, g and a were my main concerns before. I'll have a play
    around with them and post results soon. You're right, of course, I've definitely
    chickened out on the g ear.\r\nPS. just noticed, looking at the image now, that
    the blend fonts function in Fontlab seems to have smoothed some nodes that are
    meant to be corners. The s for example should be much more angular than it looks
    there."

  body: I was kind of thinking that about the K, but I quite like the x. Thanks for
    your praise of the numerals; I always find them some of the hardest glyphs to
    draw - especially 6 and 9. These are tabular figures so the zero can't go much
    wider without increasing the advance width of all numerals, including the light,
    which makes the spacing a bit too loose IMO. I'll likely have proportional figures
    too so that zero might be a touch wider.

    widened slightly on the left side. In-between /g/ looks fine. At first I thought
    I could see what you were talking about with /s/, but I think what's missing might
    not be not weight but size. /s/ may need a touch more overshoot, top and bottom,
    in the whole weight range.

  body: I tried extra overshoot on the s, but it just made it look way too big compared
    to say, z, so I put it back to where it was. Then I thought maybe there's too
    much overshoot overall, so tried reducing it. Even slightly reduced overshoot
    looks like not enough overshoot. One moment I look at it and think the overshoot
    is too much, the next moment, too little. So I'm hoping that means it's juuuuuuuuust
    right. Anything next to a z looks big though. I need to find some way of putting
    overshoot on the z!

  body: "<em>Italics:</em> I like the /R/, it has an original, distinctive shape,
    there's no need to tweak it in my opinion. It's lowercase counterpart /r/, however,
    is clearly too wide. It gives the impression of falling forward. /Q/ is wonderful!
    I'm not sure about the top right of /x/. The top right serif of /K/ could grow
    more to the right.\r\n\r\n<em>Roman:</em> The last sentence also goes to /k/.
    /k/ is also too wide. The serifs of /u/ in the light weight are too short. In
    the bold and regular weight /e/ has a \"big nose\". To fix this bring the terminal
    nearer to the eye's right end (horizontally, of course). You may compare with
    the italics, where this problem is unexistant. The weight of the different serifs
    in /t/ and /x/ is unbalanced. I would definitely keep working on /g/. It reminds
    me of an intestine :-) which doesn't mean it's badly drawn, just that it's not
    what you're looking for.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/2/9/3262384/g.png\">\r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion, you could improve it by taking into account the following:\r\n- In
    practically all text fonts the blue area has an even thickness.\r\n- The blue
    area normally slopes downwards or stays horizontal, and doesn't necessarily has
    to sit on the baseline.\r\n- The thin-thick transition in the red area is \"uncertain\".\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I would dispose of one of the two right crooks. /g/ has a very complex structure
    in comparison with the rest of your alphabet, not counting that it itself is the
    most complex constructed letter.\r\n\r\nHope it helps ;-)"

    - yes I suppose it was slightly wide, but it's a toss up between width and counter
    size and I erred towards getting the counters more in keeping with the rest than
    the width. I've trimmed it slightly since then and it's now the same width as
    the h.\r\ne - you're right, I'd already changed this but have yet to post updates
    as concentrating more on italic.\r\nu light - It's not just the |u|. I'm going
    to extend the serifs throughout the light weight, and perhaps loosen the spacing
    slightly as I do it.\r\nt and x - I agree some problems with light |x| but others
    I think are ok. I've thickened bottom right of |e|, |c| and |t| since last images

    was).\r\nIn the light roman, I've brought down the junction with the stem in letters
    like h, n, and b, and brought it up in letters like d, q, and u. I think this
    makes a big difference - getting closer to the look of the italic. Don't think
    it's needed so much in the black italic, so I left them alone.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/czech_5245.png]\r\nGetting
    a little tired of quick brown foxes so used one of Craig's pangrams.\r\n\r\nThat
    light roman ampersand is looking down a bit. gotta change that."

    caps are in progress - for the italic, they are mainly a slanted Roman (Q is like
    the italic) but I'm wondering how to deal with the more lowercase-like UC glyphs
    (A, K, R, U and X). I think the kick at the bottom which works well with lowercase
    doesn't work so well in all caps (or small caps if I changed them too) settings.
    I was thinking of reintroducing the more standard slanted roman forms of these
    uppercase letters, but I'm undecided about where to put them. Standard as default
    and lc-like as salt or stylistic set, or the other way round, or with standard
    forms in CASE function (and probably in smcp too).\r\n\r\nThese are the two possible
    cap styles in different settings:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/army_6192.png]\r\n1.
    lc style with small caps\r\n2. standard with small caps\r\n3. lc style all caps\r\n4.
    standard all caps\r\n5. lc style with lc\r\n6. standard with lc\r\n\r\nI'm leaning
    towards having the standard as default and the lc style as stylistic set, but
    I fear that alternates just end up unused.\r\n\r\nPS. please ignore spacing issues
    for now!"

    a smaller jpg version\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Range_5733.JPG]\r\nI
    think the middle three weights could do with being slightly bolder than they are
    now - the difference between light and regular is barely noticeable and between
    bold and black too much."

  body: "This is coming along well. \r\nA few suggestions to take or leave:\r\n -
    roman /f/ appears to lean rightward, moreso in the lighter weights. Extending
    the bottom right serif might help. (I don't know that the lean in itself is a
    problem, but extending that serif will help with spacing at any rate.)\r\n - roman
    /g/ I think that corner at the northeast of the bottom bowl is yet too angular
    for my eyes, but maybe you have it where you want it. Could the ear take a tiny
    bit more weight?\r\n - is roman /c/ a little light?\r\n - small caps could be
    a touch darker in every weight. I like the stemmed /U/!\r\n - /m/ is too wide
    I think, certainly in italic at least.\r\n - the (illusory) upslant of the italic
    /f/ and /t/ crossbars may be too strong.\r\n - in the lighter weights, italic
    /g/'s counters look out of balance, with the lower one looking pinched. Keep the
    structure for sure -- it's great -- but consider tweaking the proportions.\r\n
    - loop of italic /k/ looks pinched, too.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Craig\r\nI've extended /f/ serif slightly on light master. Tried
    a more curved corner to the bottom bowl of /g/. I think I like it. Put a touch
    more weight on the ear but I don't think any more is necessary.\r\nThe roman /c/
    was light (in black weight anyway). I'd already thickened the bottom (and bottom
    of /e/ too) a bit but I agree with you that it still looked light. Hopefully this
    one's better.\r\nI disagree on small caps. I do think they look light in darker
    weights but this is a spacing issue; I just need to track them a bit tighter.\r\nI
    like the /m/as it is, and the /f/ and /t/ crossbars I quite like as they are.\r\nI
    agree with you on italic /g/ and I've balanced it a bit better in the light weight.
    I think I was too caught up on keeping the top counter in line with the /a/, but
    I think it's much better now.\r\nTweaked /k/ slightly.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fumble_6467.png]"

    /a/ and /h/ look wide to me. /k/ also.\r\n\r\nInteresting italics, I like the
    choppiness, but proportions may need slight tweaking; overall a bit wide. \r\n\r\nOpen
    up the spacing on the light.\r\n\r\nComma's head is too roundy. Look at something
    like Dolly?\r\n\r\nBold lining 5 may be too wide. In fact, all the 5s are slightly
    wide I think, may be worth checking.\r\n\r\n/P/ and /R/ look a bit high-waisted,
    is that intentional?\r\n\r\nCap /J/ is interesting, I'd have to see it in a word
    to tell if it works. The tail is very clipped. That could be quite cool.\r\n\r\nSterling,
    why is the crossbar not passing through to the left side?\r\n\r\nCap /M/ in all
    weights perhaps too wide?\r\n\r\n/v/ and /w/ in the bold seem to align at different
    x-heights. (But rasterising differently when I zoom in, sometimes the v is taller,
    sometimes shorter)\r\n\r\nItalic /Q/, yes!\r\n\r\n4 looks narrow, are these tabular
    figs? \r\n\r\nOverall, caps feel less relaxed, especially /BCD/ and /G/, I'd pull
    them wider. \r\n\r\nHope to return soon ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
