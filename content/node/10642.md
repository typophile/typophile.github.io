body: Ok, I&#39;m quite a newbie when it comes to fontmaking, so I am almost embarrased
  to ask this. You guys are so good at this, but anyway... <BR> <BR>I make all my
  fonts in Illustrator, drawing curves, chopping circles etc. I&#39;m pretty familiar
  with bezier curves, but there is one letter I just can&#39;t get right yet. The
  &#34;S&#34;!. I can build it with chopped circles and simple blocks, but to get
  my font a little more exciting&#40;and atleast half-decent, not compared to any
  of you guys stuff though!&#41;, I want to make it with the bezier tool. But I can&#39;t
  get it right! Is there like a manual on how to make certain letters? I can&#39;t
  be the first person to struggle with this letter?<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'I know of no definitive answer to how a given letter must be drawn. In my
    research, I&#39;ve found diverse theories on letterform construction, and I&#39;m
    preparing a piece right now for Typophile which compares and contrasts them. <BR>
    <BR>My only suggestion would be to try to hand draw your S rather than try to
    construct it from primitives. And read this thread: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/477.html"

  body: The first question to ask yourself regarding the S is whether it will have
    a totally smooth curve in the middle or will incorporate a short straight segment
    in the middle. In either case, a good way to begin is without a straight segment.
    Put a node at the outside left edge and inside left edge, and at the inside right
    edge and outside right edge of the S-bend section. These should be extreme points,
    with a smooth fixed transition perfectly vertical. You can now play with the control
    handles between these points to define a nice curve. In FontLab, you can also
    grab the curve itself, at any point, and it shift up or down. Note that where
    you grab the curve will affect how the curve is modified by movement. I recommend
    playing around with this at some length, getting comfortable with how the curve
    responds to your touch before trying to achieve a specific result. <BR> <BR>Once
    you have pleasing curves definining your stem, you should either insert a short
    straight segment if you desire &#40;generally I don&#39;t&#41;, or a transition
    single node at the flex point of the S-bend. The most reliable way to do this,
    in FontLab, is to use the knife tool and to drag a straight line between the off-curve
    control handles defining the curve and bisecting it. This will put a point in
    the optimum position. <BR>

  body: Thank you very much for fast replies! <BR> <BR>I know the proper way to design
    a decent font is to draw it by hand, but I need to start somewhere and get to
    know Fontlab first. The link you gave me is a good starting point! Thank you<IMG

    <BR> <BR>Another thing, beeing a graphic designer myself with not much experience
    in designing typefaces, I see alot of designers on the net offering fonts <BR>and
    getting alot of exposure in magazines etc. <BR>Youworkforthem, Identikal etc.
    <BR> <BR>I have nothing against these people, but looking at their fonts, and
    comparing them to some of the stuff I have seen in this forum, there is an enormous
    gap in quality!? I mean, these guys sell their typefaces with a pretty heavy price
    tag, but they look &#42;nothing&#42; like some of the stuff I see here!  <BR>Do
    you consider them as &#42;real&#42; typeface designers, or just graphic designers
    wanting to break into another field in graphic design? <BR> <BR>After reading
    alot of posts here, I would never consider selling my fonts, just because I see
    the amount of work you put into your typefaces! <BR> <BR>I hope someday my typefaces
    will be good enough, but for now I realize I am just learning!<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
