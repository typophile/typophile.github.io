body: "Something weird's going on with my fonts: if I open a font that has been generated,
  and passed trough autohint, the contents of the liga feature changes, and FL5 refuses
  to compile (Fatal Error). This seems to be sticky, so fonts opened afterwards acquire
  the same problem (or I might just be going nuts). The only real change other than
  numberin simplified seems to be that \"script dflt;\" becomes \"script ;\"\r\n\r\nIs
  it another of the FL5 little surprises or does autohint simplify/edit liga? Please
  see transcript below:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nfeature liga { # Standard Ligatures\r\n
  # Latin\r\nlookup liga16 {\r\n    sub f f i by ffi;\r\n    sub f i by fi;\r\n} liga16;\r\nlookup
  liga17 {\r\n    sub f f j by f_f_j;\r\n    sub f f l by ffl;\r\n    sub f f by ff;\r\n
  \   sub f j by f_j;\r\n    sub f l by fl;\r\n} liga17;\r\n language AZE  exclude_dflt;
  # Azeri\r\nlookup liga17;\r\n language CRT  exclude_dflt; # Crimean Tatar\r\nlookup

  TRK  exclude_dflt; # Turkish\r\nlookup liga17;\r\n script dflt;\r\nlookup liga16;\r\nlookup
  liga17;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nAfter generating OTF and passing through FDK autohint:\r\n\r\nfeature
  liga { # Standard Ligatures\r\n # Latin\r\nlookup liga1 {\r\n    sub f f i by ffi;\r\n

  body: "Mind that the AFDKO feature file syntax as used in FLS5 and FM is a higher
    level language and does not match binary layout tables one-to-one. There is some
    \"translation\" involved which shows when you re-import layout tables. With some
    lookup types, differences are more drastic than in your example.\r\n\r\nThe \"dflt\"
    (lowercase) keyword is only used in combination with \"language\". The default
    \"script\" is designated by \"DFLT\" (uppercase).\r\nIf you want to address \"script
    DFLT\", you need to run FLS5-generated .otfs or .ttfs through Adam Twardoch's
    script <a href=\"http://www.silesian.com/software/FixDFLTScriptTagSL.zip\">Fix
    DFLT Script Tag</a>. (He also made helpful remarks about script DFLT in a more
    recent Typophile discussion, you need to google for it.)"

  body: Numpy is a set of Python libraries. If you install the big Robofab package
    it includes Numpy.

    new Numpy is the wrong version too (MAC OS 1.5, I am still running Leopard (10.4)
    on iMac 1.8 PowerPC G5). Help, squeek?

  body: "paragraph\r\n\r\nYou can decompile the GSUB-table of your Font, generated
    with FontLab. Autohint the font with the AFDKO and then merge the decompiled GSUB-table
    back into the autohinted font. But somehow I doubt, that the autohint program
    messes up the GSUB-table. However, it is worth to try. I often correct fonts in
    this way, when I want to keep changes at the minimum."

  body: Thanks, Arno. It is clearly a FLS5 bug, nothing to do with ADFKO.
