  over 2 years. I&#39;ll probably have to redraw it to remember what I was doing.
  I just remember it was pissing me off. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/729.gif"

  body: ' I really like the plain upright UC &#40;the lc &#34;me fait ni chaud ni
    froid&#34;, and the serifed caps are to me somewhat uninspiring&#41;: the rigidity
    combined with the touches of &#34;humanist&#34; stroke contrast is a cool direction.
    I&#39;d try to make this into a varied, technically &#40;but not aesthetically&#41;
    versatile all-caps font based mainly on that direction. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    look. <BR>The differentiation between &#34;g&#34; and &#34;q&#34; lc characters
    is very elegant. <BR>A really good font. '
