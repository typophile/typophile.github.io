body: "I'm working on a font that contains Smallcaps and a number of ligatures - fi
  fl ff ffi ffl ft fb fh fk fy ty.\r\n\r\nWhen testing the font and selecting small
  caps some of the ligatures return to there small cap glyphs, but ligatures fi fl
  ff ffi ffl do not change.\r\n\r\nWhats the normal practise for this situation -
  Is it best to create small cap versions of  FI FL FF etc.\r\n\r\nAlso why do ligatures
  like ft fb change to the small cap glyphs but not fi fl ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRr. "

  body: I'm not all that sure, but I believe those f ligs are unicode. You might just
    try putting smcp feature above liga feature in the OT window so it gets 1st priority.

  body: If you included the characters fi fl ffi ffl and ff (I forget their Unicode
    number), it should be for legacy purposes only. You should also have f_i, f_l,
    f_f, f_f_i, and f_f_l as unencoded glyphs, and use these in your liga feature.
    And Stephen Rapp said, liga should be after smcp and c2sc in your features file.

    of the ligature feature lookups, then it should all work as desired.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
