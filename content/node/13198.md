  body: I like it. It has a nice flavor for display, or very small texts. It is both
    pixely (obviously) but also - full of personality. The flavor of that personality
    is hard for me to describe. Part of that comes from the way the personality interferes
    with legibility. Actually, that's part of the flavor. A kind of willful disreagard
    for easy reading. The clash is part of what is interesting but it also obscures
    the flavor of what is below that for me. It makes you say, what is that? Like
    a curtain or a cloud in front of something. I guess what I mean is that to me
    it adds interest. Under that cloud is what? I am not sure. It is decorative &
    old fashioned but I guess I don't know my type history enough to guess at it's
    source. It does feel a bit dutch or spanish to me.

  body: The word "personality" sprung to my mind too. I think it's actually surprisingly
    legible. When you look at the glyphs individually, it seems like they shouldn't
    work together, but set as words, they do, in an almost inexplicable way.

  body: "Hi everybody, \r\nthanks for the posts. Maybe the great mystery behind pixeleite
    is the way as the serif became a module because of the grid. What you guys thinks?
    \r\nI don't understood about the dutch and spanish flavour, can you explain better?\r\n\r\nI
    fixed the problems with popups in the Making-off session. Take a look."

  body: "I wasn't sure why I said those things at the time - they felt right, but
    I didn't know why. Now I think I can explain.  \r\n\r\nAbout the 'Spanish'. \r\n\r\n-
    What I am thinking of here is : ironwork, there is a certain kind of ironwork
    I saw when I was in spanin in Granada & Cordoba whose density & shape have something
    in common with the letterforms\r\n\r\n-also, there is a kind on Spanish Caligraphy
    with Small & large leters whose cross bars remind me of yours. Totally Different
    style & yet there was a common feeling. Also, your font remineded me of the tilework
    I saw in Granada, Spain. None of this is provable - just my own resonance. \r\n\r\n-
    I think in part it is the way the decoration feels like an overlay that makes
    me associate this way. I guess I could be associating your font with western wood
    type because of the middle of the letter decoration but I don't...\r\n\r\nAbout
    the 'Dutch'. \r\n\r\n-There was alot of experimentation with geometric forms that
    dutch designers did which was not a retro 50's 60's 70's or 80's tech kind of
    thing but had to do simply with with geometry. Wim Crouwel comes to mind but there
    were lots of other earlier than him too. I don't think of your font as having
    the tech associations that other pixel type suggests - and that's why I think
    dutch.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of these associations? What made you decide to
    make the font the way you did? You have some explaination text but is there more
    to say?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Interesting appointments you did Eben. But I disagree of the most of all.
    About the Spanish look and feel: no iron works! Maybe ceramics! :) Sometimes the
    lowercases look to me as a calligraphy piece, sometimes. Anyway, to me the tech
    inspiration is present in the typeface, but with a exotic appeal. \r\nI really
    like the Dutch design work. In Brazil we have a great heritage of the European
    vanguards.\r\nAnyway when I start the font my mind was clear but I have only one
    the statement: Please everything else except another boring pixel font. During
    the drawings I respect the grid for the most of characters but sometimes don\u2019t
    (M for example). This kind of deliberated disobedience create most of the characters."

  body: "I didn't mean to suggest that my mental associations had anything to do with
    what you had in mind or intended. Just that this is how the font felt to me. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    the dutchmen wore off on you - influenced you.\r\n\r\nI think that by your own
    standard you have a success. \r\n\r\nWhat have people said to you about the font?
    I am interested."

  body: "Hi Eben,\r\n\r\ndon't worry! I really like your comments. Since I started
    to show the fonts, 1 or 2 months ago, I received different opinions but the overall
    concern was positive. The readability and legibility is a recurrent topic but
    is really not my principal matter. The exploration of the formal aspect to me
    is more important in this case. I agree with the legibility crusaders in some
    points. The uppercases works much better than the lowercases. The more difficult
    to me was draw some diacritcs signals because of the complexity of some one. In
    the last days I\xB4m working in another versions. One is the same drawing but
    is for print and the others are for \u201Cultra-large\u201D sizes. Take a look
    bellow."

  body: "Normally I would say, ho ho, I know that filter too... but Actually it seems
    right. I think it would be great to be able to have two sizes where the Outline
    width matched. So for example a size say 72pt. where the out line is maybe 50
    em units ( or whatever ) and a 36 where the outline is 100 em units. That way
    they would be the same thinkness when set together. See what I mean?\r\n\r\nI
    am not sure where you are going with the 2nd one."

    make some crappy. \r\n\r\nHumm two diferent glyph sizes? Sorry i' don\xB4t understanded
    you. Tell me more.\r\n\r\nI\xB4m planning make other versions with the same outline
    size but prepared to work in different layers. To make colored versions do you
    understand? This is a photoshop preview:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rafaelneder.com/pixeleite/typophile-29-06.gif\r\n\r\nwhat

  body: The red outline part, if you make it twice as thick in one version as another
    then they can be set together & match. Do you see what I mean?
