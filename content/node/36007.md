  with me about some details in Jensons typeface. I mean how, for example, the zones
  could be interpretated where curves are attached to the stems and so on.\r\nI have
  the maybe strange idea that they weren\u2019t attached in the way we are used to
  today.\r\nI attach two of my digital Jensons letters \u2013 versions of the a (its
  only a fast study not meant to be finished well) \u2013 to explain what I mean.
  I say the first one obviously is more timelike, contemporary. The second one I made
  with tiny curves that define those detail zones as far as I believe they were because
  of the engraving technique. Yet, it\u2019s only how I presume that they could be.
  Someone may say, no, its all because of the spreading ink, but I do believe that
  they had sort of these tiny triangles. Also they enhance the effect of a calligraphic
  ribbon that folds out of the stems. I like those ideas.\r\nDoes anyone share these
  ideas or is it complete nonsense?\r\nI have the theory that this way to do forms
  could help the forms in text to be less striking, less irritating for the strong
  seperation between straight lines and curves is much less pronounced.\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-2_4405.gif]"

  body: "Well, it depends. I suppose using counterpunches for counters could give
    you reasonably sharp inside corners. On the other hand, absolute sharpness would
    have got lost in the inkspread anyway, wouldn't it? If you are interested in those
    aspects, have you read Smeijers' enlightening book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Counterpunch-sixteenth-century-designing-typefaces/dp/0907259065/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7356566-3927867?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186825014&sr=8-1\">Counterpunch</a>?\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you enjoy softened lines (I do, and also think they contribute to readability),
    you might like <a href=\"http://www.lazydogs.de/fabiol\">Fabiol</a> (not that
    it doesn't have any sharp turns in counters). Some time ago I tried starting a
    thread to hear what other people think about it, but it was stillborn.\r\n"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\noh yes I bought Smeijers book a long time ago. Very interesting
    book I found.\r\nYet, I didn\u2019t agree with the theory of counterpunches at
    least not within characters like Jensons.\r\nThere are evidences that - for example
    in his beautiful \u2018g\u2019 (at least in some of his prints - not all fonts
    were the same he used) - that also the inner forms contain of Jensons genious
    formed curves that weren\u2019t round but had sharp angles were nobody would expect
    them! For example in the \u2018g\u2019 there is in fact a almost straight litte
    line on the inside nearby the stroke that finishes the letter on the right on
    the outside. There comes through his instinct that a form like this (the stroke
    on the right) would tear also the inner form towards the outside a little. There
    had to be signs of turns for the calligraphic laws behind it. \r\nAnd above all
    those details are in great balance with the rest of the letter so that the calligraphically
    moved lines form almost perfect circles in the whole like in the \u2018g\u2019.\r\nSo
    for me it seems almost impossibile to think this (the inner form) through before
    making the whole form. He was a genious but I think he worked by instinct. Counterpunches
    would have been damaging to this kind of working I believe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless
    I believe that part of Jensons real look came from designs more like in the \u2018a\u2019
    above on the right. If you would interpret the whole font as on the left side
    it would become more like a typical digital face somehow stretchy and soft in
    a negative way.\r\n\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "Hi again,\r\n\r\nyes I looked at Fabiol. It is nice.\r\nYet, for me arises
    the questions:\r\nIf we make so beautiful inspired intentionally \u201Cirregular\u201D
    forms why is the attachment of curves and straight lines then so rational so if
    only a Computer would have done it in this way. Don\u2019t know if I explain me
    right.\r\nI think it was one of Jensons strenghts that it distributed those details
    equally over the whole form. Isn\u2019t it so?\r\nYet, I didn\u2019t see an orignal
    punch or letter either so all this is pure speculation.\r\nYet, I think Adobes
    Jensons for example does not look like Jenson. That\u2019s the point.\r\nAnd why
    doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s the question to ask.\r\n\r\nStefan"
