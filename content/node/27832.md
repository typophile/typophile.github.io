    body: Neither is the M or the A either. I've searched and searched and all I can
      come up with is that's it's probably a custom something.

  body: Ooh, did another random search and ended up with Kabel. What do you all think?
    That Y looks pretty close.

  body: Oh god, the memories....I did an entire exhibit design based upon Monopoly
    and the history of the game relating to Atlantic City, last term. I'll be happy
    if I never play or see that game again for the rest of my life.
