  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,

I currently design a Wordpress-based, a bit old-fashioned yet classy looking theme for my blog and would like to use a font for the headings which carries and extends this feeling. I used Georgia rather extensively so far and would like to use a different type for the headings which should look a bit more stronger and firmer. I remembered that the $- and the €-signs have their extra-lines for representing just these characteristics and vaguely remembered these types which contain capitals with a second stem. I attached a demonstration (actually modified Georgia-letters) of what I mean.

I am not sure whether this is the right forum (Pardon me, if it's wrong...); but I would like to know if there is a particular term for this characteristic and would be glad if you could list some types providing these second stems.

Thanks in advance!
 RoyBasch


PS: Don't mind the internet's restrictions, I would use this type to generate an image for each blog entry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">These kinds of faces are known by many different names: openface, inline, engraved, handtooled, and others I'm forgetting.

ITC, for example, issued a series of "handtooled" versions of some of their popular faces (Goudy, Century, Garamond).
http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=handtooled&x=0&y=0

There are more contemporary faces with the same treatment, of course. FF Scala has an engraved option, for example:

Font Bureau's beautiful Narcissus uses this effect:

		<div class="commentbody">Another blatant plug for Fontshop. It's funny how the guy posting this thread wants to know about inline and handtooled fonts in general, and the response from Stephen Coles leads strait to Fontshop. Funny how Stephen does this consistently, only giving FontShop products as type solutions and no other vendor. Funny about that.

Fontshop gets so much promotion from Typophile and having its type director as one of the moderators here (conflict of interest) it causes peeple to wonder along the following lines (this quote is from another senior typophiler and senior font maker, name withheld):

Oh, James. A simple look through the archives will show that I link to MyFonts and other vendors quite often. Yes, I represent FontShop, but I do my best to link to the site only when I think it will be helpful to the discussion.

> “I can’t get past the idea that the site is really just a guerrilla marketing vehicle for FontShop, Font Bureau, Veer and Villa.”

That's a strange notion. The Typophile forums contain many, many more links to MyFonts than to any other vendor. Add to this the fact that MyFonts is one of many Typophile sponsors, with an ad in the right column, and the statement seems even more absurd.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tried some free fonts such as Alderney Engraved, Academy Engraved LET plain or BD Engraved, but none of them suited the blog design the way I imagined or just didn't work in sizes smaller than 34pt (looks noisy though the second stem looks clearly)...

Ignoring the personal quarrels, the linked website has a nice catalogue of fonts resembling my idea. My favourite font among them is ITC Cheltenham Handtooled Std Bold but since I am a non-expert user the price of 35,00€ (appr. 49,35$) seems disproportionate to me. Apart from that it works fine in a size of 21pt...

Anyway!
@frode frank: Eason Inline Caps is in deed an interesting font style though its fluid appearance doesn't fit into my concept. This font looks to me as being predestined for an advert of a noble, classy perfume. (Whatever, don't mind...)

Working out an own handtooled version of Georgia or other popular Transitional fonts seems to be the best way to add the favoured impression. Unfortunately, since I have never designed a type before or even thought about it, I guess this handcraft is a bit too tough for me to produce a good and consistent piece of typography.

I will keep looking for a free font matching my idea.

Kind regards,
 RoyBasch

James, what a wonderful surprise! As Typophile is constantly looking for extra hands to help the Typophile community, they will greatly appreciate you volunteering to invest a considerable amount of your free time to help moderate the boards. Your primary task could be to ensure absolute neutrality is preserved in all of Typophile's threads and comments. Make sure to bring your "senior Typophiler" along. :^)

Happy New Year!</div>
