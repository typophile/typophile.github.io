  reason for it that current logo is not very readable.\r\n\r\nSince current logo
  been used for a few years now, I would like to preserve some of it's qualities such
  as overlapping letters and an \"i\" tittle at the end. Original logo is a heavily
  squished Arial. \r\n\r\nI am having seconds thoughts regarding this direction, and
  considering designing a brand new logo. I understand that attached still need polishing,
  but would like to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks "

  body: Yes -- there is hope. I can envision some possible solutions. You've improved
    the readability, but you've also introduced some optical challenges. Perhaps the
    key lies in finding a natural connection between the letterforms. If I by any
    chance can be of help, feel free to contact me via my profile.

    It looks odd that 3 letters are connected and 1 isn't.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could
    show an updated version and also some brand new logo concepts. "

  body: "Oh, sorry, my bad. \r\n\r\nFWIW, I think the T needs to be a bit wider to
    balance out the width of O. Alternatively, the O could be made narrower, but then
    its squarish shape really stands out and in a good way, so I'd adjust the rest
    to play along with it and not the other way around. Overall though, I think it's
    a great improvement over a cluttered mess of the current logo."

  body: "FWIW I think it's a great improvement over the original. It's really good.\r\n\r\nThe
    O still dominates the wordmark, to a much lesser degree than before, but it does
    look bigger (wider) and heavier than the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nI would also
    explore an option of rounding T's and I's corners a bit, because of SO looks very
    smooth and it's in a contrast with the straights and straight corners of the T
    and I."

  body: "Yes.\r\nTo make this logo an \"evolution\" it should have at least something
    reminiscent of the old logo. As much as I like the latest type-only-no-tweaks
    logo I suppose it would benefit from a little detail.\r\n\r\nWhat I would suggest
    you to try is to cut the top part of /I/ to create a dot (just as high at the
    top bar of /T/ is) and position the dot to the right at the same vertical level
    and as much to the right as /T/ is from /I/. If that will be too far, you will
    maybe have to kern /TI/ pair to make it look harmonious. I think that would make
    the \"lovable\" part of this logo.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I really like these letter
    shapes. Nice, bit poetic but still strong and with character. Nice choice. But
    about letter shapes. /O/ would benefit from some <em>lighting</em>. It feels heavier
    than other letters. So you either adjust the weight of other three letters or
    adjust the /O/ to have the same weight."

  body: "The one with the tittle definitly makes it more of a unique brand,\r\n\r\nOverall
    I like it. Maybe you can have another look at the stroke widths. I think the thicks
    could be a hair thinner."
