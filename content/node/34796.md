  called Regaliz by Ipsum planet....\r\nThis one is a superb type and I am really
  looking forward to catch it up :) \r\nThis font can be downloaded for free from
  \"http://www.neo2.es/\" the website of the Spanish fashion magazine, but  a download
  code is require to obtain the type, this code  was given in their magazine number
  47 (over two years ago) and love to know if some one around has it and wants if
  it wants to share it with me  :)  \r\n\r\nIn return I'll give the codes I got for
  downloading types from this website (neo2) and as well some cool types I got :)\r\nBest
  regards, thanks.\r\n\r\nDarmotype."
