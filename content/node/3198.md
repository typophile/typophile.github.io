body: Okay so i was converting a TTF to a postscript flavoured OTF on my PC using
  FontLab. I installed it on my Mac this morning, but none of my applications would
  find the font file. What did i do wrong? Any ideas?

  body: I&#39;m Running OS 9.2.1 and ATM 4.6 <BR>I installed the font simply by dragging
    it onto the system folder and dropping it there, and then clicked &#39;OK&#39;
    when i was prompeted to place the file in the fonts folder. <BR>I then tried to
    use the font in Photoshop 6, InDesign 2, Illustrator 9, and MultiAd 2 v1.6.2,
    oh and Word for Mac and the font didn&#39;t show up in the font list in any of
    these programs. <BR>I tried just doubleclicking on the OTF icon and got the message
    i usually get when i do the same to a PC TTF - &#34;The font cannot be opened
    because there is no sample provided&#34; but i don&#39;t know whether this is
    unusual for OTF fonts or not. <BR>I&#39;m afraid i need to walk through the exporting
    process from start to finish, but the problem is i don&#39;t know where the start
    is!!! any helpful ideas/information on this would be much appreciated. thanks
    again for listening.

    that I need ATM 4.6.2 to have open type PS support, maybe that&#39;s my problem,
    eh? i&#39;ll give it a whirl... <BR>oh wait, but those House Industries OTF fonts
    worked just fine on my workstation... so maybe it&#39;s still something else...

  body: Okay, so i followed Adam&#39;s naming conventions and that solved all my problems,
    Thnx Eric! Thnx Thom! Maybe the fact that i completely skipped over the OT naming
    before was my problem, haha. Anyway thnx again!
