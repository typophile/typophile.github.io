    Even so, the timing for over here won&#39;t be indecent. <BR> <BR>BTW, you wrote
    &#34;Monday through Friday&#34;: does that mean it will repeat each day next week,
    or what? <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'Yes, UK time. It&#39;ll be five individual programmes on the theme. <BR>
    <BR>The listing only goes up to Wednesday at the moment, but here&#39;s the detail
    so far: <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>1/5. John Carey,
    chairman of last year&#39;s Man Booker Prize judges, explores the process of reading
    and the science of how words on a page create pictures in the mind.<!-/quote-!><hr
    size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>2/5.
    John Carey, chairman of last year&#39;s Man Booker Prize judges, explores the
    process of reading. Does reading in a different language or page layout affect
    our understanding of a text?<!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr
    size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>3/5. In the third programme in the series, John
    Carey investigates the importance of the personal imagination each reader brings
    to a text. He talks to neuroscientists about the reading process, and asks authors
    Sue Townsend and Francis Spufford to explain their experience of reading.<!-/quote-!><hr
    size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR>Hopefully, typical of the sort of thing that the
    BBC can do so well.'

  body: I&#39;ve heard there are ways to record streamed audio, it&#39;ll probably
    be available for 7 days after broadcast. The problem with these daily &#34;shorts&#34;
    is that it is normally only the latest programme that&#39;s available. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    sure the BBC would pass on an enquiry to the production company responsible.

  body: '&#62;&#62;I&#39;ve heard there are ways to record streamed audio <BR> <BR>Well
    a TV/radio tuner card is the easiest way, but mine seems to be incapable of picking
    up Radio 4 at the moment. If all else fails I could record the program as an mpeg
    from the TV, then convert to a sound file. <BR>Another way of recording:  <BR>Most
    decent sound cards, and even some crap ones, have a switch in the software control
    panel to set recording source between line-in, microphone, or &#39;what I hear&#39;.
    <BR>Free software such as wavelab lite will then record &#39;what you hear&#39;
    to a wav file. Converting from wav to mp3 or CD audio shouldn&#39;t be a problem.
    <BR> <BR>There are other ways, but I think these would be the most straightforward.'

    you download it from the bbc site &#40;right mouse clips/save&#41; then I&#39;ve
    tried this: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.audioutilities.com/audio-mp3-recorder/audio-reocrd-wizard.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.audioutilities.com/audio-mp3-recorder/audio-reocrd-wizard.htm</a>
    <BR> <BR>You have to follow thier instructions how to record from your source.
    Run the Audio Utilities program and then create a new .mp3 file. Run RealAudio.
    Open the .ram file. Select record in the Audio Utilities then play in Real Audio
    and it records it into mp3.'

  body: you can also do the same thing with the Windows Sound Recorder. Run the Real
    Audio file and record it in the Windows recorder and save it to .wav.

    concern about sound. BTW, isn&#39;t it ironic that the narrator has a speech impediment?
    :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Today&#39;s seemed promising though - I&#39;ll be tuning in soon.

    a web page w/ all the programs. It seems like they&#39;ve done that to most of

  body: Blag originated in cockney slang, where it meant to steal something. More
    recently it has been used in a general sense of &#39;nabbing something&#39; whether
    legally or not. So one might say that one &#39;blagged the best seats in the cinema&#39;,
    for instance. It is also used to refer to talking someone into giving you something,
    e.g. &#39;I blagged my way into the nightclub&#39;. <BR> <BR>By the way, I&#39;ve
    found the best way to blag BBC radio on Windows is <a href="http://www.xi-soft.com/default.htm">Net
    Transport</a> which will save streaming audio and video in native formats. Then
    you can convert to MP3 with something like the <a href="http://www.boilsoft.com/rmtomp3/">Boilsoft</a>
    converter.
