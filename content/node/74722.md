  body: "Sorry to burst your bubble, Kenny, but this doesn't involve either Trajan
    or Mason, save for the ampersand, which could concievably have been customised
    from Trajan's. The hard serifs (and the top-left serif on the \"N\") tell me it's
    not Trajan, but probably a modification of a standard issue transitional serif.
    The flat cusp on the \"A\" is throwing me; several of the other characters are
    reminiscent of Times.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: "Nah; the bowl returns to the vertical stroke too soon, and the tail of the
    R in G&R's logo swoops out and down, whereas Mason's just protrudes straight out
    from the bowl.\r\n\r\nHere's a slightly bigger, though blurrier, sample of the
    logo.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/120914/\r\n\r\n-NJ"
