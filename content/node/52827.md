  longer presenting the keynote and the announcement that this is the last year for
  an Apple booth, who knows what's to come.\r\n\r\nIf you're in the area want to check
  it out, you can get a free pass to the Expo Hall over at the Extensis blog: http://blog.extensis.com/?p=2512\r\n\r\nHope
  to see you there!\r\n\r\nJim\r\n__________________\r\nJim Kidwell\r\nExtensis "
