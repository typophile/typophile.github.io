body: "Another newsletter and another CheapProFonts newcomer: David Kerkhoff is an
  up-and-coming type designer specializing in handmade and grungy written scripts
  - some of which are destined for our usual multilingual treatment.\r\n\r\nPlease
  enjoy this bunch of recently released quality fonts - all available at our usual
  low price of only $10 each! :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-11-01_5318.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIn
  this news release I present 14 fonts:\r\n- a 6-face family from Jan Paul & Brian
  Kent\r\n- 2 grunge fonts from Guillaume S\xE9guin\r\n- 2 display fonts from Vic
  Fieger\r\n- 1 handwriting from Kimberly Geswein\r\n- 1 geometric font from Levente
  Halmos\r\n- 1 handwriting font from David Kerkhoff\r\n- and a version of DIN Mittelschrift
  digitized by myself - I have made it primarily because I wanted to have a bit of
  fun with it by experimenting with giving it some very different expressions far
  removed from its serious and no-nonsense roots. Watch this space!\r\n(or check out
  the first variants already released on our website ;)\r\n\r\nLike the idea behind
  CheapProFonts? Like our selection of multilingual fonts? Like our friendly and reasonable
  licensing? Like us to inform you about every new font? Like us! :)\r\nOur [[http://www.facebook.com/pages/CheapProFonts/216135682084/|Facebook
  page]] and [[http://twitter.com/CheapProFonts|Twitter feed]] updates with every
  single release!\r\n\r\nRoger S. Nelsson\r\n-- \r\nhttp://www.CheapProFonts.com\r\nHigh
  quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers
  with a small budget!"
