  (see [[http://typophile.com/node/54451|node/54451]]) possibly a more accessible
  version of [[http://tinkerhouse.net/lettersoup/|lettersoup?]] where you can make
  some general decisions about a typeface such as:\r\n\r\n//serif type: slab\r\n//serif
  size: 4 units\r\n//vertical stroke thickness: .75 units\r\n//horizontal stroke thickness:
  .65 units\r\n//curve arch..\r\netc..\r\n\r\nand then have the characters generated?\r\n\r\ngranted
  there are about a million more subtle nuances that computers can't automatically
  generate and I'm not looking to actually produce typefaces in this manner, but I
  think it'd be pretty helpful applied in sketching and generating some general ideas
  in the development of a typeface.."
