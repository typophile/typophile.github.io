body: "I've created a PDF for a client which allows them to fill out fields. This
  seems to disable the ability to change the security settings. But they need to be
  able to lock the file after they have filled it out. Is this possible? Thanks. Oh
  and they are using Adobe Reader.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Put a signature field in the PDF that the submitter must click to digitally
    sign. Add an action to the Signature field that, when "signed", the PDF becomes
    read only. Then under the Advanced menu, select the "Extend Features to Acrobat
    Reader" which allows people with Reader to digitally sign PDFs and save form data.
    Hope this helps.

    of you might have saved me A LOT of research time.
