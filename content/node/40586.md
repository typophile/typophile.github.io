  happening based on punctuation? I've used the search engine/typowiki/resources section
  of this site and unearthed a thread or two which have been a good insight. \r\n\r\nGoogle
  has not been my friend is this research instance, throwing up more pages aimed at
  how to use it properly as opposed to why we use it, how it could be changed and
  so forth. I've dug out a fair few of my type books including 'Hart's rules for Compositors
  and Readers' from the Oxford University press, which in some instances says when
  setting type leave the problem of punctuation to the author!\r\n\r\nI really want
  to know as a designer what other people are thinking about punctuation, why it has
  become so throw away, how can it be changed and adapted to suit our modern ways
  of communicating? How can we use typography to further emphasise the emotional qualities
  of the written word? \r\n\r\nIt's a research idea I've had rattling around my head
  since my uni days so I thought I'd come here and see if some could shed some further
  light on the topic. \r\n\r\nBec \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>How can we use typography to further emphasise the emotional qualities
    of the written word?</em>\r\n\r\nWhy would we want to? It seems to me that if
    you want to employ emotional markup, then you need something other than punctuation
    as we have inherited it, because punctuation is doing a different and important
    job: it is marking the <em>structure</em> of text, and thereby helping us to avoid
    ambiguity of meaning and to communicate thoughts effectively.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    people use the bits and pieces of typographic punctuation to make emoticons such
    as ;) but that's using punctuation signs for something other than punctuation.
    That's fine, but you shouldn't confuse the two things: punctuation, which indicates
    structure (very precisely), and emoticons, which indicate emotions (very crudely)."

  body: "Thank you for your pointers, sorry for not getting back to you all sooner,
    I have tonsillitis and a stinking cold right now but the lure of the web is too
    strong!\r\n\r\nFlorian, I don't know of the 'Fisches Nachtgesang' but I have come
    across the John Harris book in my preliminary research. \r\n\r\nJohn, maybe we
    need to move on with English language and try to adapt a new stance towards providing
    emotion to the written. My head hurts too much right now to think about it in
    depth but with so many people having so much disregard for the rules of language
    maybe a system that is made 'easier'(I mean that in a very loose sense) or accessible
    to everyone, even a universal set of rules. I don't know, it is such a huge subject!
    \r\n\r\nEmotion cons are an area that could be defined as a way of expressing
    yourself but then everyone needs to be clued up on every possible combination
    that exists, I'm not even sure they do enough of a job of getting the point across
    in some situations. \r\n\r\nThanks though, I'm off back to my bed with a lemsip
    and some essays I've just found :)\r\n\r\nBec "
