  a font, I have all the letters as a psd file, what's the best way of getting this
  all into Fontlab? \r\n\r\nI have saved as bmp, but Fontlab won't see them, I'v open
  in Ai, live traced, painted and saved as an .eps. This opens, but it's upside down,
  and all the paths are wrong.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nJustin"
