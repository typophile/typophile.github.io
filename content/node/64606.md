  body: i read it as 'the lion king' initially. maybe change type size etc etc for
    one or the other. also work on the letterspacing. some people would advise against
    tracking lowercase

  body: I messed with the kerning on the letters. I changed the color to separate
    Lion and King. I kind of feel like changing the color is cheating in a way, because
    I should have figured out a way to separate Lion and King using just type. what
    do you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lion_5158.jpg]

    tracked small caps or caps for the 'king of the jungle' bit?\r\n\r\nalso the beware
    seems like an afterthought"

    using optical or auto kerning?"

  body: with photoshop text tool, i'm highlighting the two letters, then choosing
    the size of the space between the two letters. i'm guessing that's called optical.
    okay, i'll fix what you said.

  body: "@ etahchen\r\n\r\nAre you using faked small capitals (downsized versal letters)?\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t
    use block text for the lines \u2018KING | OF THE | JUNGLE\u2019.\r\n\r\nNone of
    the examples with the (small) capitals does work.\r\n\r\nThe crown is missplaced
    in all examples.\r\n\r\nThe margin kerning needs to be corrected.\r\n\r\nAnd the
    leading is not harmonically balanced likewise.\r\n\r\nIn your third example he
    is too tight now.\r\n\r\nAnd somehow you arbitrary choose the point sizes and
    the capital and small letters in the beginning of the words.\r\n\r\n"
