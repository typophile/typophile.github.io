  using Quark 6.5...Univers is having a lot of conflicts with Quark -- sometimes it
  won't print, othertimes it prints, but the apostrophe comes up as a box when printed.
  Ugh. Has anyone had this happen to them? Aside from going out and buying a mac and
  putting InDesign on my computer, does anyone have a work around or a fix?\r\n\r\nThanks
  SO much!"

    but from the program I was using to manage fonts: Extensis Suitcase. Are you using
    it?'

    font be corrupt?

  body: Whose version of Univers is it? And what year was it released? Since there
    are loads of different Universes out there, it could be that you've got some voodoo
    type there.
