  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am a doctoral candiate  at Hong-Ik university, Korea. My interest is a certain typographic composition which, assumably, started in the early twenties(1920's). But it is not easy to find some available references and even know of the accurate term for it.  <BR> <BR>Belows are typical samples, which show the certain structure that use the same alphabet among two or more words. <BR> <BR>In fact I am in trouble because I am planning to set it as a thesis theme. My thesis is about some possibilty that this can be adapted to Korean Typography. It has not been considered because the Korean, Hangul structure is quie different from the English's. <BR> <BR>In the early stage of my thesis, the terminoloy and references about it is absolutely in need. It will be thankful if you give me even a simple comment on it.  <BR> <BR>Bjornz Li <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/68650.jpg" alt="sampes of the structure"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;assumably, started in the early twenties <BR> <BR>In a way. Crossword puzzles were a huge fad at that time, which is probably related. <BR> <BR>But actually, they go right back to ancient Rome: <BR> <BR>SATOR <BR>AREPO <BR>TENET <BR>OPERA <BR>ROTAS <BR> <BR>&hellip;and have a long cult history. <BR> <BR>I've recently seen an astonishing Christian &quot;poster&quot; from 1500(?) years ago which was composed of a massive grid-field of normal-reading text from which various significant diagonal and vertical phrases are highlighted in different colours. Unfortunately, I am not the world's best note-taker, so I can't give you any further information, other than it was in an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge about 4 months ago. <BR> <BR>There is also the traditional genre of &quot;acrostic&quot; verse, where the Initial character of each line, read vertically, spells out a message. <BR> <BR>Check out &quot;The Oxford Book of Word Games&quot; and Willard R. Espy, &quot;An Almanac of Words at Play&quot;, to approach this phenomenon from the literary angle, which is, I believe, equally, if not more relevant than that of design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi NIck, thank you again. <BR> <BR>I know that typography is closely linked with poetry, as Lissitzky's &quot;About Two Square&quot; was kind of a typographic interpretation of Russian Futurist poetry.  <BR> <BR>In 1920's the notion of orthogonality was influential. So we can see it at the every(not some) other famous graphic work. Muller Brockman's work is typical case which spreaded Swiss international typographic style.  <BR> <BR>I think that your &quot;Acrostic &quot; style has played a major role to maximize typographic vision   without help of image. So it is ubiquitious. I am focusing that it is a typographic view/phenomenon/principle, not merely a word game for no brainer.</div>
