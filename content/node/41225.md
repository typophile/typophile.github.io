  body: I have tried to insert an image here (.jpg) but I get an error message from
    your site that says "can't copy image". Any suggestions regarding that/?   How
    about the typeface used on BBC World? It is very similar. Can you identify that?

    not good enough to tell with the small caps, but hopefully someone here can enlighten
    us."

  body: "<cite>It is not pretty.</cite>\r\n\r\nHAHA! Agreed, NBC is usually a little
    better than this. I guess the Today show isn't pulling in the same $ as some of
    the other broadcasts."

    to nice effect.

  body: You are right it is Helvetica neue. At this point I am not sure how the small
    caps are accomplished. You all think it is ugly. Please look at the sample I have
    attached here. Does anyone know of a Font family that has a structure/feel like
    this. I am hoping for one that feels a little more refined than the sample.  I
    feel like I have seen one/some like it, but I can't seem to locate what I am imagining.
    And yes,  NBC has been doing a nice job in their promotions with Klavika, I agree.
