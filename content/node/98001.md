  is used in the 1986 film \r\nLabyrinth. Unfortunately I've had no joy. \r\nHowever,
  hopefully you pillars of \r\ntypographic goodness can help identify \r\nmy culprit?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lab_6366.jpg]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks."

    & 'A' ligature it feels like a crisp 'Windsor' [which I know it's not] or similar
    1900's ish face. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Labyrinth_5094.jpg]"
