body: "I have just joined, but my soul has been here for years. I have often used
  this site as a reference in my own personal studies. I have been borderline-obsessed
  with writing systems in general most of my 31 years on the planet, and I have a
  passion for learning about any that I find.\r\n\r\nI hope to share and learn much
  here, as I have in other places.\r\n\r\nIf anyone may be interested, they can venture
  over to my forum for a moment and look around.\r\n\r\nhttp://scriptorium.17.forumer.com/index.php\r\n\r\nThat's
  all for now, I'll check back tomorrow. "

  body: hrant, no I was unaware of that particular Yahoo group. I appreciate you pointing
    it out, and I apologize for the delayed response, school, work and family life
    have kept me quite busy of late.
