  \"h\" ascender above the capital \"T\" in some instances, but not in others?\r\n\r\nare
  there certain categories of typeface where this tends to be the norm?\r\n\r\nfor
  example, looking at slab, they are more uniform in height -- at least from what
  i can see. But, then there's the occasional slab face that bucks the trend, and
  has ascenders taller than caps."

  body: 'IIRC making the cap height lower than the ascender was an innovation of Griffo,
    in the Bembo type. This helps to make the ''color'' (grey) of the caps more similar
    to the lower case. There are other ways to do this, and also it''s a choice how
    much the designer wants to make the caps and lower case similar in color or different. '

  body: "What George said, plus:\r\n- The smaller the x-height the more sense it makes
    to have shorter caps.\r\n- If you want the text to be more \"scannable\" (which
    usually involves capitalized proper names) you should make the caps stand out;
    otherwise make them blend in.\r\n- In onscreen rendering small differences between
    cap height and ascender height are made to disappear.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Also, since uppercase letters are generally wider (and contain more white)
    than ascenders, they tend to appear \u201Cbigger\u201D. Reducing the size of the
    uppercase can help balance a word better. This gets less pronounced in large sizes.
    I suspect that has something to do with the trends you observe: e.g. intended
    for display vs. intended for text. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind not all type designers
    make concious decisions. Many just do whatever the others did."

  body: "gargoyle linked to a thread in which nick shinn makes a good post.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nNote
    that Jenson's face had massive ascender-height capitals, but Griffo made the improvement
    soon after (\"Bembo\" the typeface).\r\n550 years ago.\r\n\r\nHowever, the modern
    style put caps at ascender height, 200 years ago.\r\n\r\nSo, a different strategy
    for oldstyle and modern.\r\n\r\nCarter's Olympian was the first 20th century news
    font to have ascenders taller than caps.\r\nThis trend has continued, and now
    faces like H&FJ's Chronicle leverage this effect mightily.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\"Reducing

    ads in a copy of esquire, which was laying around. in only one instance, ascenders
    were taller than caps for display faces -- and it was marginal.\r\n"
