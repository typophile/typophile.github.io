body: I love the lettering used in the old Chicago Park District signage, and was
  thinking of designing my first typeface, based upon this. But I wanted to see if
  it already existed before I began work. So, could you all please help--what is this
  typeface, if it already exists? Thanks for any help!

  body: There are some experts around on this kind of metal typeface, Its similar
    to [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18|neutraface]] but its
    not it! I'll see can I find the thread for you! It was on postoffice signage if
    I remember correctly!

  body: "Stuart Sandler is also working on something similar, I have found a few links
    about this metal signage which can be found on alot of American office buildings
    from the 50's and 60's <em>I think</em>. Ask some of the experts or just read
    the blogs!\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/40502\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/sets/72157603592705592/

  body: Thanks so much for the start and help. This should be some fun research, before
    I even get to the typeface design. :)
