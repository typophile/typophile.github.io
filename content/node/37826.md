  body: "What? We can't run with this? Let's really get a Letterman's Top Ten Font
    List.\r\n\r\n#!0. You learn that you're on a typographer's \"S\" list when you
    suggest Comic Sans for your corporate logo."

  body: "That 'T' used for both 'Top' and 'Ten' is such a striking and incredibly
    clever design. This should go in a design annual or award show\u2026 :^P"
