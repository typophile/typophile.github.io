  I follow on twitter posted this a while ago, can't remember who or I would ask them.
  I believe it is a mockup for Royal Mail slip that they leave when they \"deliver\"
  your parcel but you were out.\r\n\r\nIt looks similar to Archer and ITC American
  Typewriter, but it's neither of those.\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nThe full image can be seen her http://cl.ly/1Aj2"

    to be unable to move past this font. Kinda sad, seems like I'm unable to let go
    of an ex :)\r\n\r\nI've never had this much trouble identifying a font, I've tried
    everything from WTF, Identifont, forums and even some very shady looking places
    out of sheer desperation."

    Royal Mail in the UK.  The corporate font should be Chevin, but I have no idea
    where that logo came from. '

    it's actually connected or done for the Royal Mail

  body: "I just want to make sure I haven't gone completely looney and aren't seeing
    things just to quench my desire to find this font.\r\n\r\nPer Niks suggestion
    I had a look at Chevin, which seemed awfully similar to the font in question,
    but then went on to use MyFont's \"More fonts like\" feature where I, completely
    accidentally, came across this font.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/adesso/\r\n\r\n95%
    sure it's Adesso Italic. In the screenshot it looks like it might be a Light version,
    but as far as I found there is no such weight.\r\n\r\nAnyway, some confirmations
    before I stop searching, go ahead and buy this font would be reassuring :)"

  body: Adesso is pretty close, but not 100%. The "w" in the sample has pointed vertices,
    and in Adesso they are curved.

    not for me! Glad to be of help, though now you don't have any excuse to slack
    off! Router is a beautiful design, the '8' in particular. Have a nice day now.

    I decided against it. Brain fart, I guess. Well done.
