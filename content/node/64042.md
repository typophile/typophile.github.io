  vibe.\r\n\r\nAny idea where I could find a collection of typefaces similar to these?
  \ Particularly with rough-ish edges so it has a hand drawn look?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    Font ID Guide]] is all about. Use Part 6 for sans lettering styles (maybe Part
    5 has some too), and Part 7 for the connected script styles. Grungier, bouncier
    fonts are in Part 14.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
