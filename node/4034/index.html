		<div class="commentbody">Not disagreeing with you there &hellip; at all &hellip; Hrant. Swift 1.0 was used all over the University of Reading, I grew to really like that version. I suppose I'm speaking from how I might choose which version. Granted the <a href="http://www.baer.com/Media/ContentDetails.aspx?ContentID=100" target="_blank">'69 Mustang</a> has a cool factor. But typefaces aren't cars. It would be more practical and make more sense to invest in the new version which probably has some tech advances too.</div>

How much can you improve an already superb font without making drastic changes? And are individuals not susceptible to versionitis?</i> <BR> <BR>Did Gerard personally digitise or directly oversee the manufacture the original Swift? I doubt it. Swift 2.0, apart from the obvious benefit of the extension of the range of weights, might be likened to a 'director's cut': you're getting Swift the way the creator of Swift wants you to have it. This is not to say that some people might not be perfectly happy with the earlier version, or even prefer it. However, if I wanted Swift for a job, and the budget permitted, I would go for Gerard's version. Among other (non-drastic) changes, I believe the spacing is improved.</div>
