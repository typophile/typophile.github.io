  teach us to build type, just how to use it correctly.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering which
  font style is the easiest to start. I thought a script (maybe brush) would be easier
  because it doesn't matter if its a bit \"incorrect\" or some curves are not very
  good.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys recommend to me?"

    use bezier curves freely but you don't have to worry about weight/stress. You
    can quickly see then where the glyphs become congested and what you would have
    to do to correct this for more legible results. You can draw an alphabet like
    this very quickly and it is very easy to iterate as you only make changes to the
    skeleton, rather than editing outlines. It will also highlight the necessity for
    differing thickness in verticals and horizontals, as Nick points out, but IMHO
    it's good to see it go wrong for yourself! Good luck, enjoy.\r\n\r\n* Attempt

    rewarding and rapid way to begin with letters, thus, without too much expectation,
    an appropriate technique for anyone starting out. I'll keep reading.

  body: "Actually (just answering James) I've had some experiences designing type
    and lettering (well, not professionally, but anyway) and I've more than once got
    the feedback that the version I had drawn by hand was much more interesting and
    pretty than the traced/vectorial one. And it did take me a while to really see
    the difference. I found out that when looking at the one done by hand I actually
    immediately \u201Csaw\u201D the vectorial version of it; which is fine, but means
    I wasn't really paying much attention to what was actually there. I've also come
    to discover that I would design two quite different characters if given a shot
    at both media designing the same idea. I think you don't get much \u201Ctime\u201D
    to \u201Cthink\u201D while drawing by hand, which _may_ introduce \u201Cyou\u201D
    (a more complete \u201Cyou\u201D, one that takes into account the unconscious
    and subconscious \u201Cyou\u201D) into the equation more than if you just take
    it to the b\xE9ziers. Anyway, both methods are fine, gotnov. Any method is fine.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I would suggest \u2013 if you would grant me the honour of asking me \u2013 would
    actually be that you don't stick too much to any one style. Play around with it.
    Start with sans lowercase and then add slab serifs, for instance. See what works
    and what doesn't. Or start with one typeface/character/glyph that you really like
    and roll with it. Or yes, do start at what you think would be more difficult,
    maybe a script, yes, maybe an italic, maybe a totally geometric typeface. Start
    with numbers. Take a very close look at all the typefaces that you think look
    great. Take a close look at the ones you believe to suck, too, of course. This
    is very important: search, look, see, watch. Try all methods available: drawing
    by hand, going straight to the b\xE9ziers, using a brush, a potato stamp, whatever,
    just make sure you keep going back to all of them to really see the differences.
    Print examples, scan examples.\r\nBut the most important advice would be, I think:
    don't ask anyone anything! :P Relax, enjoy all styles, take it all in and \u201Cjust
    do it\u201D and keep doing it. Go on, do it. Do it. Go!\r\n\r\nBut that's all
    only if you were to grant me the honour of asking me and really wanting to know
    my answer (if you were thus misguided that you'd actually listen to me)."

    are better off \"throwing out\" their first design. Maybe one is fortunate and
    produces something really great, but it seems better to go in with low expectations
    with an eye toward trial-and-error. (I think a lot of new designers who release
    their \"first\" design are, in fact, dismissing one or more previous, bad, abandoned
    attempts -- but that's pure speculation on my part.)\r\n\r\nOne very early experiment

    a graphic design student and I'm now in my 4th and last year and I can tell you
    that it was extremely helpful. Frank Blokland taught us in our first year. I've
    got maybe 30 A2 sized bankpost sheets filled with calligraphy. It's a bit of a
    grind, but when I look back at it, it was really helpful in understanding the
    basic shapes of type. Frank Blokland was a student of Gerrit Noordzij who you
    may know. He wrote "The Stroke". I'd just buy that book and start writing with
    a broad tip pen yourself. I could start explaining what I have learned, but the
    book explains it a lot better then I can.

    to start this adventure and I had a passion for typography. This was a good start.
    So,  I decide to choose a sans typeface simply because I loved those one. I didn't
    know where I went. But my choice was a good one for me. I learned a lots and I
    made many mistakes before I released it (4 years after). Some people told me it
    was not the easiest way to start, today I agree, since I release \"Harfang\u201D,

    kern them, and move on to the next one. This way you get to just focus on the

    the Font RMX tools from Tim Ahrens and use the harmonizer to balance the curves
    after you draw the letters so that you have a sort of digital tutor who can give

    that is why I recommend the geometric sans as being the doorway to the form of
    the digital font.\r\nIt reduces the notions of sidebearings, alignment zones,
    and stem widths to their most basic and most easily understandable and manageable
    forms. These modular distances are the fundaments of font construction, and will
    accommodate almost any genre of type.\r\n\r\nFor instance, serifs complicate sidebearings
    by providing two inter-glyph distances: that between serifs and that between stems
    (not to mention between optical centres).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    basic spacing, and also you should not start with serif to learn about form. Do
    your own mistakes.\r\n\r\nFirst, do what you feel is what you want to make, and
    then start digging into type design conventions. There are plenty. You can go
    and see the Hague graduates brilliant typefaces. They all look like sisters and
    brothers. I personally like them, but it is hard to choose any single one to use.\r\n\r\nAll
