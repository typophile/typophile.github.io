  body: "I think Nina is spot on. The \u2018g\u2019 is different from the retail version.
    On the other hand, the spurless \u2018g\u2019 in your sample is the same as in
    this <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Typewriter+Fonts/Superstudio/\">in-use
    sample</a>.\r\nF"

    here\u2019s a close-up from the Lykkeli site:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lykkeli_6606.png]\r\nUgh,
    awful spacing! It almost seems Superstudio\u2019s sole purpose is to demonstrate
    why the \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018l\u2019 in monospaced fonts need serifs."
