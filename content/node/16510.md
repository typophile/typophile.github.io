body: "Hey, I do a weekly comic published here in the foggy wonderland that is Halifax,
  Nova Scotia, and thought you guys might appreciate it. It's almost purely typographic,
  hand-drawn, and there are at least three people who like it alot. So let's make
  it upwards of five, and I'll have achieved everything I have eveer set out to do,
  and can go hibernate or something. \r\n\r\nIt's called the hall of best knowledge
  and you can see the first 25 or so here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rayfenwick/sets/787564/\"><strong>http://www.flickr.com/photos/rayfenwick/sets/787564/</strong></a>\r\n\r\nAnyways,
  I hope you like it. I've lurked here for a long time (love the forum widget) so
  it's nice to *participate*. \r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nRay Fenwick\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've added Ray's comic to our repository of "<a href="http://typographi.com/000737.php">Serifs
    by Hand</a>" and I dare say his work is one of the finest examples. Imperfect
    and delightful.

  body: "They're terrific Ray!\r\nIt is so good to see hand-work at that scale and
    level.\r\nThe beauty is in varying letterforms, hand-penned, not \"perfect\" or
    sterile... the viewer is reminded that EACH CHARACTER was crafted and like snowflakes
    none are identical.\r\n\r\nA good reminder that we needn't be so <em>font dependent</em>
    all the time.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<em>Can
    somebody tell me what font was used for the Coca-Cola script?</em> ;-)"

    doppleganger</a> must think the opposite and have a stronger opinion of it, to
