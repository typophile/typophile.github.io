  Is \u201Cfont quad\u201D correct?\r\nWhat is meant is the measurement from the horizontal
  upper to bottom borderline which define a font\u2019s space for the glyphs."

  body: Em is the vertical measurement, top to bottom, while the quad is the same
    measurement squared.

  body: We also used to call it an M-quad, as a space, equal to the square of the
    point size in foundry type--a quad in 12 point metal was one pica by one pica
    by space height high. In the digital world, all this goes away because nobody
    agrees on things any more.  It used to be simple, it was a block of lead and that
    was the end of it :-)

  body: "The measurement from the top to the bottom of the characters in a font is
    the \"point size\". There is no simple term in English for the space from ascender
    or cap height, whichever is greater, to the descender depth, which would exclude
    possible small amounts of white space in the font in order to permit alignment
    of the baseline.\r\n\r\nIf you mean a horizontal distance equivalent to the vertical
    point size, that is called an \"em\". In fact, instead of measuring the width
    of a column of type in picas, the same unit of horizontal distance is called a
    \"pica em\" to make it clear that a horizontal distance is discussed."

  body: "Thanks all for your remarks. As a see I haven\u2019t been totaly clear in
    my initial question. I did mean neither the vertical measure (= point size) nor
    the horizontal one (\u201Cem\u201D), but the square unit which results from both.
    So speaking, \u201Cem square\u201D or \u201CM quad\u201D seems approriate to me."

  body: 'Traditionally, the term "quad" refers to physical chunks of lead used as
    spacing. The term "em square" now refers to the square on which digital type is
    drawn, and determines the vertical spacing, before leading.  '
