  in the Herb Lubalin 'Art Director....' book, so its most probably an ITC font?\r\n\r\nI
  do know it, but not at the moment!... think the lower case 'y' and 'e' are the key.\r\n\r\nI
  promise to stay behind after class and write out the answer hundred times.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's ATF Jenson. I remember it from old Letraset catalogues. It is the ancestor
    of Italia, Colin Brignall redrew the ATF Jenson series for Letraset in 1977.

  body: It was just called Jenson. There were five weights going from Light to Black
    and Letraset had only Medium and Extra Bold. It seems to have originated in the
    Seventies, but I don't know who designed it. The Letraset catalog is mum on the
    subject (usually they give credit). I'm pretty sure it's not related to ATF Jenson.

  body: Mark is correct - Jenson in 1928 ATF Specimen Book looks nothing like the
    Letraset Jenson. My 1986 Letraset Catalog lists no designer and only medium and
    extra bold weights. Has it been digitized? - That is the question?

  body: I wouldn't call it Letraset Jenson as it didn't originate with them (they
    only have two weights, remember?). It looks a bit like something Les Usherwood
    may have done, but if that were the case, I think Letraset would have given credit
    as they did with his other designs.

  body: Headliners had a very similar (identical?) font called neo-Jenson which may
    be where it originated. It's difficult to tell with them whether a font is their
    original design or their version of an existing design since they added the "neo-"
    prefix onto both.

  body: Photo-Lettering Inc. also had it, and this is most likely the shop that set
    the type for Lubalin.

    on projects back in the 80s.

  body: "I wonder if it was Freda Sack... a Google search unearthed the following...\r\n\r\n\"British
    designer Freda Sack was born in London in 1951 and gained a diploma in graphic
    design and typography from the Maidstone College of Art. Her first job, in 1972,
    was with Letraset International where she worked as a photographic retoucher,
    later moving into their type studio. Under the supervision of Bob Newman she learnt
    the skills of drawing type and stencil cutting, and began to design headline faces.
    She became involved in producing artwork for the Letraset instant lettering dry
    transfer sheets, and trained junior designers.\"\r\n\r\nand she has since designed
    Jenson Old Style bold condensed (with Colin Brignall, 1982)\r\n\r\nwodyareckon?"

  body: "I don't think so. Jenson Old Style Bold Condensed <em>was</em> based on the
    ATF Jenson, whereas the mystery Jenson was not. Also, if she had done it for Letraset,
    why would they only offer two of the five weights? Finally, Letraset always gave
    credit in the designs they originated and included \"\xA9 Letraset\" with the
    credit, as they did with her Jenson Old Style Bold Condensed."

  body: Don't be discouraged. This is an unusually difficult one, and having a common
    name (Jenson) attached to it doesn't help.
