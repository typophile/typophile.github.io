  body: Your opinion has a strong historical precedent, Mats. John Baskerville's 18th-Century
    contemporaries, accustomed to types of the Garamond style, disliked Baskerville's
    type so much that they claimed reading it would would cause damage to the eyes.

  body: The story of Benjamin Franklin's trick involves showing a person who complained
    about Baskerville a speciment sheet of Caslon, and telling them it was Baskerville.
    They made the same complaints. Both Garamond and Baskerville were great fonts.
    Some attempts at digital revivals mess them up, and the ITC version is too light.
    ITC Garamond is also bad for text. So I think it's which Garamond, which Baskerville,
    and which usage...

    I'm a Garamond guy.\"\r\nI don't see much wrong with either, though digital revivals
    are not always successful, and both typefaces have some fairly strong limitations
    in regard to application \u2014 at least in my opinion.\r\n\r\n\"It has that inflated
    x-height that I detest.\"\r\nI quite like that. I mean, I personally like a medium
    to low x-height more, but I think the large x-height fits the typeface. It's quite
    a shocking design though, especially for the 18th century. I think that's exactly
    what attracts me though. Not that Baskerville is one of my favorites, by far...\r\n\r\nMats,
    what do you think of 'Baskerville' by URW++ (not URW Baskerville)? It has a lower
    x-height, lower contrast and has been made more contemporary.\r\n\r\nI'm also
    curious what you think of Mrs Eaves."

    Eaves? As some here know, I equate it to a beautiful woman with\r\na serious speech

    (which Robin Kinross has equated to a loose\r\nbicycle) kills it for immersive
    reading.\r\n\r\n* Contradicting the light color and small x-height.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    ITC Baskerville isn't 18th century. I wouldn't expect fonts to be...\r\nEven if
    it's a loose revival, for comfort's sake I will call it an 18th century design.\r\n\r\n<cite>Mrs
    Eaves? As some here know, I equate it to a beautiful woman with a serious speech
    impediment.</cite>\r\nHaha that's quite an accurate description in my opinion.
    I didn't state Mrs Eaves because I think it's a Baskerville-esque design gone
    well. I was curious to your opinions because I've always thought Mrs Eaves is
    really peculiar. I actually like the spacing though. I mean, I wouldn't use such
    loose spacing myself but somehow it gives the typeface more character. It stands
    out, for better or worse.\r\n\r\nI never tried this (I don't have Mrs Eaves on
    my computer) but doesn't it look good/better if you reduce the tracking? I can
    imagine since it's not kerned for that, it won't.\r\n\r\n"

    \"character\" by destroying readability.\r\nI agree with that statement but I'm
    not sure it completely applies to this typeface for a couple of reasons.\r\n1.
    I don't think the spacing is so large that it really destroys the readability
    but I admit that's subjective.\r\n2. Regardless of the spacing, I wouldn't set
    my book in Mrs. Eaves. The design isn't suitable for that. I'm not sure why you
    expect it to be.\r\n3. I'm not sure about the intentions of Licko but she either
    realized the points we're making against Mrs. Eaves or Mrs. Eaves was more intended
    for display use from the beginning, because Mrs. Eaves XL was added with an expanded
    family so I conclude this one was meant for body text.\r\n\r\n> Speaking of which,
    I don't know what it is kerned\r\nI honestly have no idea myself. Mrs. Eaves is
    quite confusing to me."

    made a mistake (the same\r\nmistake that Peter Bilak, a designer I admire, made
    with Eureka,\r\nalthough not as severely). BTW the XL came many so years later\r\nthat

    along. Whether that's true or not, I think it's a very bad thing that its purpose
    and application is so vague. I would really like to think that there were good
    reasons for the design and spacing because it's a little sad that this could be
    a genuine mistake."

    Designers most certainly influence their revivals with skills, knowledge and taste.
    If I were you, I\u2019d get hold of a PDF specimen of a couple of revivals (both
    free and paid), and compare them. Look at the up-close beauty of single letterforms,
    try your hands (eyes) at the real lakmus test for any text face: reading it in
    a paragraph, and consider their technical scope. \r\n\r\nSorry about the preaching
