  is now online.\r\n[[http://www.atypi.org/04_Mexico/40_timetables]]\r\nDetails and
  presentation will improve; registration should be available in the next week or
  so.\r\nLooking interesting: the first three days (the 'main conference') are in
  a single track with often short presentations. The last two days, which combine
  TypeTech and a series of longer workshops, has several things going on at the same
  time and the opportunity to engage in depth.\r\n-- \r\nMark Barratt\r\nText Matters</em>"

  body: "Thanks for answering, Tiffany (I was beginning to believe that I was alone
    on this, ha). Well, I was hoping for any kind of comments: who is coming would
    be fine, but I\u2019d like to hear what do you people think about speakers, themes,
    workshops\u2026\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know, maybe I am the only guy who has waiting
    for this info and just wanted to share (though the info is incomplete by now,
    so it may be early to decide if you are going to attend)."

    to find it. \r\n\r\nWell, I think it looks like a great conference, as I said,
    and I know Roger Black and the rest of the board have been hard at work on this
    one for quite some time.\r\n\r\n"
