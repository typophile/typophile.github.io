  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello 
I&rsquo;m a regular poster on another board where we study Thai language.
There is a problem for new learners in being able to display the 
Thai script in a larger size.
<a href="http://www.thailandqa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=15033">http://www.thailandqa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=15033</a>
Firefox has a work around for this, but for whatever reasons not all posters
are or are willing to use Firefox.
There are many options for adjusting the view both within windows and IE, but 
none of these including personalized CSS (tools/internet options/accesibility)
are quite whats needed. 
Posters on the forum YES can choose to alter the size of the script posted.
But not all learners are at the same level. And learners cetrainly don&rsquo;t want to be
restricted to posts made larger for them.
Posts allso often contain both English and Thai and only the Thai needs to be enlarged.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wondering&hellip; Is it possible within designing a font, to pre-determine it&rsquo;s display size to be considerably larger? I&rsquo;m wondering if that is even a value that can 
be controled by designing a custom font?</p>
<p>Your insights appreciated.

<p>Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure it works exactly that way. In font creation programs, the letters are drawn within a grid that is 1000 x 1000 units, and when you are ready to output the font files you decide which point sizes you want. But you can still make the font any size you want once you have set some text in a graphics or layout program&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Cordoba, thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly getting a little excited, hopefully I don&rsquo;t 
misconstrue or jump to impossible conclusions.</p>
<p>When you say &ldquo;1000 x 1000 units&rdquo; I&rsquo;m guessing this is the way font smiths measure the number pixells within a standardized space.</p>
<p>And when you are saying &ldquo;decide which point sizes you want&rdquo;
I will understand this to be the varying sizes of text that are displayed as I adjust my font size in a cocument or can see when I open TTF files in C:\WINDOWS\Fonts with their poit sizes listed beside them.</p>
<p>And then you finally said &ldquo;make the font any size you want once you have set some text in a graphics or layout program&hellip;&rdquo; Which I appreciate and understand, but unfortunately is not usefull for my immediate needs.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m hoping might be possible, is that when you &ldquo;output&rdquo; the Font files, are there whithin the TTF file actually several copies of varying &ldquo;Point sizes&rdquo; ?
Is it somehow possible while outputting the &ldquo;Point sizes&rdquo; to rename/reconfigure the values of them ?
What I mean is, is it possible to corrupt the file (of a custom build) so that a 48 point letter is labeled, and read as being an 18 point ? 
I still haven&rsquo;t convinced myself that i&rsquo;m coherent in my meaning&hellip;.. I wan&rsquo;t the Thai text to display larger than the English. If the software is displaying the page at a given point size, could the Thai text come out larger ?</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ve had an after thought, would that mean that the space between the lines would be over-run? Could I then Build 2 sets of fonts, and English and a Thai, The English one having exagerated blank space above/bellow the letters to compensate ?)</p>
<p>Again any insight is appreciated.</p>

Now at least I know my babling was understood.
The people running the board say they have run the
gamut trying to resolve the problem from the weboards
software side. They have recently done an upgrade so,
it&rsquo;s unlikely that change will come again for a while.</p>
<p>I will learn more about fonts for a while, maybe make a
set of my own to appreciate what&rsquo;s involved (not artisticaly
I can see in &ldquo;Typograpy 110&rdquo; there is great deal more than simply understanding, and my artistic side is undevoloped)
If there is nothing there I will study the software of the web board for myself.
Ultimately there is FireFox, but that won&rsquo;t help others on the board. And though the internet is a small fragment of the media that typography/caligraphy expresses itself, your likely still aware that IE for better or worse commands the lions share of the market.</p>

I did a wikipedia search on &ldquo;em Units&rdquo; I think I have the jist of the idea.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to illegitimately use or otherwise copy the  work of any designer/publisher. I do have friends who are artists. Though they are musicians I appreciate how much hard work and time artists put into their work only to have them stolen without credit or apreciation shown for their work.</p>
<p>Permision (at a price if affordable) would be fine. If not I would have to explore how difficult it would be to make my own (which would involve buying software).</p>
<p>The idea that &ldquo;all your users would need to download and install the font.&rdquo; is &lsquo;Exactly&rsquo; what I&rsquo;m after, that would leave it open to the individual to choose whether it improved the readability for themselves.</p>
<p>If you have some time, can you give me a bit of an idea of how I could proceed ? How much would it cost to have someone make such a font for me ? Would I need to produce a font set for both English and Thai ? Whom could I approach ?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to know how I could move forward with this, so any offerings are appreciated.
Thank you

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can see one more problem:
If you increase the size of some glyphs (letters), then you will have to increase the size of the em, which increases the line-spacing. So lines without any Thai letters will look very widely separated.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it should be pretty simple.</p>
<p>Once you have permission from the owner of the font (the designer or publisher) &mdash; alternatively use an open-source font, get a font-editing program. I would suggest FontForge (<a href="http://fontforge.sf.net">http://fontforge.sf.net</a>) if you&rsquo;re using Linux or Mac (some people here don&rsquo;t like it, but this is an easy enough job, and I&rsquo;m a FontForge fan anyway). Using FontForge on windows is a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>If you choose FontForge:</p>
<p>Start FontForge. Open the font you want to edit. Select the glyphs you want to resize. Choose Element-&gt;Transformations-&gt;Transform&hellip; Set the origin to &ldquo;Glyph Origin&rdquo;. In the drop-down box, change &ldquo;Move&rdquo; to &ldquo;Scale Uniformly&rdquo;, and adjust the number to, say, 200%. Click OK.</p>
<p>Choose Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;General. Adjust the &ldquo;Em Size&rdquo; by the same factor as you scaled the glyphs (if you chose 200%, double the em size, etc.). Click OK.</p>
<p>Choose Generate-&gt;Generate Fonts, change things as you see fit, and click Save.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

I have looked at the software and I don&rsquo;t think installation should be a problem. I have custom built PC for video edit and theres lots of room on the drives for that software. As well your post seems to make the task sound simple enough the way you provided a walk-through for me.</p>
<p>I have 2 more questions if anyone has the time?</p>
<p>Someone recently messaged me saying
&ldquo;As all those Fonts are available for free Download I assume that it is allowed to use them, but I am not sure so.&rdquo;
Is that assumption a fair one ? Does this free distribution simply limit me to using it as is or am I allso permited to alter the font as I intend to ?</p>
<p>Second question; The spcecial requirements for displaying Thai text, is this problem software side only ? Or does it complicate the way in which the fonts are made
<a href="http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/ZzzThai/thailang/index.html#problems">http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/ZzzThai/thailang/index.html#problems</a>
i.e. is there more to creating a Thai font than I am understanding at this point ? Or are Glyphs just glyphs no matter the character set ?</p>

The Thai Linux Working Group and NECTEC has made several fonts (apparently of good quality) under the GPL (open source; you have to distribute modifications under the same licence). You can get them at
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/thai/thaifonts-scalable/nectec/">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/thai/thaifonts-scalable/nectec/</a> and <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/thai/thaifonts-scalable/tlwg/">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/thai/thaifonts-scalable/tlwg/</a> (these sites offer &ldquo;.sfd&rdquo; files, which can only be opened in FontForge).</p>
<p>Yes, the difficulties of Thai fonts affect type designers too, albeit in a different way. However, you should not be affected, as the font you choose should already have this done (if it is of decent quality).</p>
