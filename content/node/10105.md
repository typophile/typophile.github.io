  but I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows of a good free font that would do the job
  just as well. I need it to do a window border for a client, who owns a DQ shop.

    seller of &#39;Dairy Queen&#39; products, the owner of the store, or you, should
    also be able to get a useable logo from them directly.? &#41;</i>

  body: I got a logo, all right, but it&#39;s a 200 pixel-wide .jpg &#40;bleh&#41;.
    I googled for a logo and got a better one, but what I really need is the font.
    I can trace the shapes &#40;letters included&#41; easily enough in Freehand, it&#39;s
    just time-consuming. <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m designing is a vinyl window border
    that will go across the top of all the store windows, so I&#39;m getting everying
    in nice clean vectors. Having the font would just speed things up a little.

  body: I did follow the link, but what I need&#40;ed&#41; is more than just a flat
    picture of the logo. I had to have the lemon-shape and lettering seperate, as
    I have several elements to combine in different ways. <BR> <BR>But it&#39;s done
    now, thanks for the help anyway.
