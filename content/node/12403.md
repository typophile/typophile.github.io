  good licence font that is similar to Kravitz by Ben Balvanz. I like the look of
  the new Aspirin Advance font from T26 or Byrant from Process :)\r\n\r\nI've tried
  every way I can to get in contact with Ben to licence Kravitz, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAaron."

  body: "Thanks so much for your detailed response :-)\r\n\r\nSome excellent suggestions
    there, and if I'd caught this not 30 minutes ago I probably would have went with
    either Century Gothic or UniF, but I ended up going with Byrant, which I'm happy
    with, the only thing I failed to notice was that it wasn't unicase [I'm going
    to assume Unicase  is where fonts mix up upper and lower case in one case, ala
    Kravitz]. \r\nI thought I would be able to sucessfully modify the lettering in
    Photoshop to get the mix of cases I wanted.. I think I will have to fiddle alittle
    more :)\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help, very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nRegards,
    Aaron."
