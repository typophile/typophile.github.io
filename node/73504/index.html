  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In a previous thread I began in the “Release” forum, I mentioned receiving an inquiry about licensing some my fonts from a large online marketer of printed goods. What should have been a simple task of determining pricing for server-based use became more complicated when the agreement they offered included rights for any media or application which might be developed in the future—in essence, obsolescence insurance. After considering input from participants in the thread, I decided that this provision was a no-go. However, I am fairly confident that, if this entity sought this particular concession, other potential licensees may also do so at some time in the future. Despite some resistance to considering the community of fontmakers an “Industry” (see the “That if?” thread), wouldn’t it serve our best interests to have some kind of common stance on this issue?

What is the next Big Thing for fonts? Maybe this has already been discussed at various conferences but, at first glance, it appears to me that we might get a clue from Cloud Computing. The idea of <em>subscribing</em> to software served up on the web is, when you think about it, the functional equivalent of obsolescence insurance. The idea is, instead of paying moderate to princely sums for periodic updates, cloud users have their software updated on a continuing basis, and pay a monthly fee for the convenience. Is it possible that font licensing for the cloud is the Next Big Thing in fonts? Your thoughts?

One example is for the episode "City on the Edge of Forever" of the Star Trek TV show.

So I can understand people not wanting to suddenly have to relicense all their fonts simply because they need to make their web sites available in a new way; for example, in a smaller format designed to be read on mobile devices.</div>

This happens all the time, but most of the time you'd never notice it, since the song that was replaced wasn't an integral part of the scene. I've played bass on a couple songs that ended up on either the DVD (Felicity) or the download (The Black Donnellys), and the songs are so much in the background that no one except crazy hardcore fans would notice the difference.

My favorite example of this is "Wayne's World". There's a scene in a music store where Wayne (I think) is playing "Stairway to Heaven" on a guitar, and then an employee walks over and points to a sign on the wall that says "No Stairway to Heaven". If you ever see it on TV (they still play it on Comedy Central every now and then), the scene makes no sense, because they replace the music with some random guitar noodling (it actually inadvertently makes the scene funnier).

I think the same thing happened in the syndicated reruns of "WKRP in Cincinnati" (at least with some of the songs).

Music licensing is really expensive. These days, the production companies are being smart about it and licensing maybe one well known (i.e. expensive) song for a show, and then licensing a bunch of songs from independent artists from much, much less money (a well known song might cost $30,000, while people like my friends who have songs placed on shows get $1000-$2000), and more importantly, they're setting up the deal up front so that it covers the DVD or download. In the old days (i.e. ten or more years ago), they'd just license a song for a show, and then they'd have to deal with any repurposing of the show with new licenses. I just read recently that the show "The Wonder Years" probably won't ever be released on DVD because licensing of all the late 60s/early 70s music, which was so integral to the show, would be too expensive.

So to bring this back on topic, if the same thing were ever to happen with fonts, I'd imagine the same thing to take place. People might license Helvetica Neue for a big fancy book, but for the web, or PDFs, they'd settle with Arial, rather than paying additional licensing fees.

A couple of years ago the show "Dirty Jobs" (Discovery Channel) changed their theme song for several episodes due to a music licensing issue, although I don't know the details. It caused a huge uproar with their fans until they eventually got the original theme back. But I'd never realized until your post that licensing issues were so common.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You could check out the Movie 'Sita Sings the Blues' for a nightmare story along these lines. The filmmaker Nina Paley spent six years animating her own feature film, using music in the public domaine- only to find out that broadcast copyright works differently from public use copyright. Now the only way she can distribute the film is to give it away.

I don't know how it would work for individual type founders, but for a distributer- I could see (and as a user of fonts, would love to have) a service like Safari Books Online, where for a monthly fee, one has a 'bookshelf' of a certain number of fonts to be used or tried out, and each month, one can swap out a certain number of these for new fonts. So a typographer could refine and refresh the palette over the years without having to pay hundreds of dollars for great new fonts that one will only use a couple of times.

Yes, as I have stated elsewhere. The only way the *really important* IP-holders can hold on to their properties (movies, tv, music, etc) is by going 'cloud' — content will be delivered to consumers on a pay-as-you-go basis & this will be a viable business model because the cloud-experience will be a far more richer one than the one a consumer/user can achieve by him/herself with the traditional computer model of having data stored locally.

A lot of current developments are indicative of this trend, e.g. Apple building that huge data center, HP buying a firm that's heavily into datacenters, Google and their Book Project, TV-streaming becoming more important, that gaming in the cloud thing (can't remember the name - I hate gaming), ever faster networks (fibre!), iPad and its imitations (tablets aimed at consuming data, not producing them), etc. etc.

I can only guess how things will be different from the way they are now, but the WILL be.</div>

<em>what are you asking, nick? i don't get it. something about the fututre?

As I understand it, the <em>eventual</em> full implementation of Cloud Computing will consist of applications which reside "in the Cloud," that is, on remote web servers. Users will access the apps through their web browsers--or a new generation of web-interface apps--and word-process, design or whatever it is they do now with apps residing on their local machine drives.

The advantage this arrangement affords users is, because the apps would be subscription-based, the end user has effectively purchased obsolescence insurance, because any updates to the apps would be made on the server. The next time a user logs on, that user is working with the most recent version of the app, and he or she doesn't have to pay for an upgrade. The advantages for the software distributors, because the apps would be subscription-based, are numerous: no costs associated with promoting and rolling out upgrades, and a steady revenue stream from subscriptions.

In many ways, the public has been conditioned to expect continuing costs as a prerequisite for life in the twenty-first century: people routinely pay cellphone bills which are larger than some car payments I have had, and don't blink. The subscription model is here to stay.

When (not if) this happens, will the type community be prepared? If someone wants to subscribe to Nick Shinn's Elegant Text Fonts package or Nick Curtis' Wacky Headline Fonts package, what are they going to pay on a recurring basis?</div>

I agree that this is probably the future, but there are potential problem with that approach. One is that many users --especially corporate users -- don't like to upgrade apps right away since new versions are often buggy. 

I suppose there are workarounds in a cloud situation, though, like giving users the option use a legacy version of an app.

One reason why this may happen is, I think, that software developers feel the need to add a LOT of improvements at one time in order to justify the price of an upgrade. If changes were made incrementally--and as they were thoroughly tested--unpleasant surprises would probably be minimized.</div>

So,if I understand correctly, you talking about fonts being distributed from server-side files, meaning the fonts will be never actually be in the End-user's hard drive, but will be able to be used in any application as if it was on your hard drive, providing you paid a subscription or even a per-font price?

If that's what you mean, than this is something I was thinking about and hoping for for years! of course I understood that the technology wasn't there yet to make it possible for users to actually print documents from any application on their own private printer, if the font file wasn't installed in their system.

But what if it somehow was possible? let's say, with a purchased individual utility or something that communicates directly the original font file on the server with your own drive/applications&printer? 

If something like that would be possible it would be absolutely brilliant! 
- The user will benefit from never having to archive his purchased fonts, since the original is always on a server somewhere.
-The user will have access to the font from anywhere on his laptop or other computers if multi-user was purchased providing an internet connection is possible.
-It will be problematic if you are off-line, i suppose.
- It will enable easier updates to fonts on the server either free or purchasable for major updates with one click.

- it will also eliminate all font-pirating (or make it almost impossible) since the communicating utility can be made exclusive for one or more computers and will be useless without the actual font subscription.

- Still have to figure out how to send files like pdfs to service bureaus.

but hey... i have 70% figured out already!! :)

any thoughts?</div>

Why not a single font price purchase? Is that something you think the end-user would not be interested in in the future?

I seriously worry about subscription based font market. Maybe for web-fonts & websites it's a practical solution, but I seriously doubt it will bring any just revenue for the type-designer himself, unless he/she offers the subscription directly.

Would only the most popular fonts benefit the designer with some money value for their hard work, and the more "exclusive" designs be doomed to collect 20% of almost nothing once a year?

Seems this system will benefit and make profit for everyone, except the designer himself!</div>

<em>Seems this system will benefit and make profit for everyone, except the designer himself!</em>

That possibility was the <strong>precise</strong> reason I started this thread. I don't think the subscription model is a matter of <em>if</em>: it's only a matter of <em>when</em>. Font-wise, it may work as a temporary font cache that allows printing to paper or electronic document during a session, which cache then clears itself at log-off; or, it may be handled in some manner undreamed of at present. In any case, the subscription model is inevitable. My question was, and remains: will the community of fontmakers be prepared to deal with it in a unified manner? Can we develop some standards for permissions and pricing?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">you do realize what such companies trying to make users believe, right?

That the service (wither the webfonts or other) subscription IS the product and the actual font design is an OPTIONAL BI-product.

Of course, for typekit and all the others, their service IS their product. They are willing to offer this seemingly low price tag on it since they don't actually sell you the actual desktop font.

But we, type designers, and anyone living off their hard work in this business, should somehow find a common ground where both parties get their fair share and get real.

Point 1) There wouldn't be any bloody webfonts business without actual fonts!
Point 2) There wouldn't be any GOOD webfonts out there without the hard work put into it from both sides, the designer and the one providing the service.

I don't mean to sound negative here, I'm also just trying to figure this out from my perspective as well. Unless there's something I'm missing, as for now a subscription solution doesn't seem to cut it as fair for the designer. Period.

And now they offer the self service make-your-own-web-kit. What's the deal on that? Under what license? make a web-kit with what fonts? What the..

It's becoming too technical and I have too many questions... phew.</div>

PRECISELY: that's the purpose of this thread, to get designers thinking about how we, as an "industry," are going to deal with this inevitable development (HP and Dell are currently in a bidding war for cloud-savvy 3Par - http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100827-707275.html ). So far, most of the comments have been reactive rather than proactive (I hate that word, but sometimes it fits). Are we going to let others dictate the terms, or are we going to develop some common approach to subscriptions.</div>

<strong>In fight for 3Par, HP tops Dell's bid with a $1.88 billion offer</strong>
<em>By Jessica Mintz, Associated Press
Saturday, August 28, 2010</em>

SEATTLE - Hewlett-Packard boosted its bid for 3Par to $1.88 billion Friday, topping Dell's offer by 11 percent and again raising the stakes in the bidding contest for the data-storage company.

The $30-per-share offer from HP came just hours after Dell matched HP's Thursday bid of $27 per share. The latest price is three times what 3Par was trading at before Dell made its first bid last week, for $18 per share, or $1.13 billion.

Dell and 3Par said earlier Friday that 3Par's board had accepted the latest bid from Dell, which only has to match the terms of other offers under its initial agreement with 3Par, based in Fremont, Calif.

On Friday, 3Par shares surged $6.43, or 25 percent, to close at $32.46, which is above HP's latest offer price, signaling that investors expect Dell to respond. In a statement, Dell spokesman David Frink said the company will review HP's latest offer and "act in the best interests of our customers, shareholders and long-term value creation."

HP and Dell, among the world's largest personal computer makers, are looking at 3Par as a way to build up their "cloud computing" businesses, delivering software, data storage and other services to customers over the Internet.

They're also both trying to expand beyond the PC business, where profits are shrinking as computer makers compete with lower prices and where the cost of parts has increased.

Cloud computing holds the promise of rich profits for technology providers. Many companies aren't buying their own computer servers for certain tasks anymore. Instead, they're paying to have software they would have stored on those machines delivered to them over the Internet.

Dell, HP and others are taking advantage of the trend by offering cloud-computing services on a subscription basis and selling equipment and software to help customers build their own cloud systems.

Cloud computing can help reduce data-center expenses because the systems are designed to be shared by multiple customers, which spreads out the cost of operating pricey equipment. The servers and storage computers need to ramp up or scale down quickly based on demand to give customers the same high level of service; 3Par's storage machines are made for that kind of system.

Both HP and Dell can afford to continue bidding. Even though Dell is half HP's size, Dell has almost as much cash as HP. Dell reported $12.4 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of last quarter. HP had $14.7 billion.

Shares of Dell, which is based in Round Rock, Tex., gained 14 cents, or 1.8 percent, to close at $11.89. Shares of HP, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., declined 22 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $38.
