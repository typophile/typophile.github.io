  body: I think the red should be a similar size & weight to the black. What is the
    reason for the handwritten look of that letter?

  body: "I concur that the handwritten \u0395 is a little weak. There's no need to
    make it as bold as the black text, because the red already add to its visual \"weight\".
    But a little bolder/larger should be better (I would made a little less thin the
    40 too).\r\nAlso, I think you should align all the red text to the vertical center
    of the black one and not to the baseline as it is now."

  body: "If you're going to go with hand-drawn 'E's, go with actual hand-drawn 'E's.
    Because they're exactly the same, they don't look hand-drawn. Get out the India
    ink and a brush, and make eight strokes.\r\n\r\nIf you feel the need to use a
    font, don't go with one as readily available as Bradley Hand.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
