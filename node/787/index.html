Historically, those letterforms exhibit the principle characteristics of a given typeface. So it's a quick way to get an idea of what the entire font looks like. Sometimes seen as Hamburgefons, you can also set a pailndrome sentence, such as "Frowzy things plumb vex'd Jack Quadrat!". <br> <br>Tony</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tony--A nitpick here: A palindrome is something that reads the same backwards as forward (e.g., "Madam, I'm Adam."). What you have there is a <i>pangram,</i> a sentence (usually) which contains all the letters of the alphabet.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually, I started with "Hamburgevons", but then switched to "Hamburgefonts" because I'm not particularly fond of the "v".

<div class=commentbody>(re "Madam, I'm Adam.") <br> <br>What a great book, by the way. Hilarious. <br> <br> <br>(re Hamburgefonts, etc.) <br> <br> <br>Linotype, I know, was using it by 1978 or 1980. I saw it used there in their letter drawing office, and they got me to use it in the planning of my TF Bryn Mawr series. <br> <br>I never asked them, but might Linotype have started using it via Mr. Frutiger or Mr. Zapf? <br> <br>Ruari McLean's excellent 1980 'The Thames and Hudson Manual of Typography' shows just the phrase 'Hamburg' being used in some Monotype Plantin showings on p. 78. <br> <br>That might have helped spur its popular use along. <br> <br>The idea with 'Hamburgefonts' and 'HAMBURGEFONTS' (as I first saw it used at Linotype and about the same time, printed in the pages of ITC's wonderful old 'U&lc' printed publication), and later 'Hamburgefonstiv' and 'HAMBURGEFONSTIV' (as it was later first expanded on in print, elsewhere) was that if you started defining a new typeface concept with those letters, that by the time you were through, you'd have all tested all the shapes and intercharacter relationships (providing sidebearings) for what you'd need to define pretty much throughout the rest of the font. <br> <br>ITC started showing it in their publication 'U&lc' in ads announcing to budding designers how to submit new typeface ideas to them. Basically, they (as I recall) just wanted to first see 'Hamburgefonts' and 'HAMBURGEFONTS'. <br> <br>I agree that it likely came from Linotype or perhaps the old URW (while they were digitizing ITC typefaces on contract). Linotype was using URW's (Dr. Karow's) IKARUS minicomputer-based (not desktop yet) digitizing system then. <br> <br>Or, perhaps from the old iteration of H. Berthold AG (based in Berlin). <br> <br>H. Berthold AG's positively exquisite 'E2, Berthold Fototypes, Body Types, Volume 1' (February 1980), on p. LXVIII, uses 'Hamburgefons'. (Actually the whole line was displayed as 'H Hxkp</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you want to try your hand at writing pangrams, try this: <a href=http://www.ms-studio.com/Animation/pangrammerhelper.html>Pangrammer Helper</a>. It's a little Flash application I designed partly to promote an upcoming font release. It's not officially on my site yet and isn't quite finished, but it works as is and is fun to play with. <br> <br>If you use Safari, the cut-'n'-paste feature does not work from the edit menu or with the keyboard short cuts. You must control-click over the editing field and use the contextual pop-up menu. This appears to be a bug in Safari related to Flash content. <br> <br>Also, the server my site resides on seems a little flaky this morning. If you have trouble getting to it, wait a few minutes and try again. I'm looking into it.</div>

I still have a measuring tool I got from a prepress company in Helsinki sometime in the 80's. It has cap heights, lines, angles, screens, a ruler and text models in different sizes typed "Hamburg". Odd though, all the type related measurements are in millimeters.</div>

Possibly. It only has the company's name. Sadly, they don't excist anymore. I have a different kind of tool, too (without the Hamburg), also given by a different typesetting company no longer in business.

<div class=commentbody>I have one of those - and I think it's an Agfa.
Because most fonts (especially back in the day)
have comparable usage of the EM space, it sort
of works.

<div class=commentbody>I have a couple of the old Agfa versions stashed away somewhere, and I think I showed it to a few students as an "antique."

This (was) is very true, Joe.
When I first landed at CG, I did see "CHAMPIONED - championed" and "CHAMPIONS - champions" as variations as well.
Since ITC started sending all of their source specimens (film font days) and used "Hamburgerfons" the Type Dept. at CG started using it more for comparitive purposes.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow! what an old fossil this spambot dug up!
I recall seeing "Championed" in some old design magazines, but more recently the phrase "Humanfleshburger"is one I've seen font samples in.</div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>Linotype, I know, was using it by 1978 or 1980. I saw it used there in their letter drawing office, and they got me to use it in the planning of my TF Bryn Mawr series.
I never asked them, but might Linotype have started using it via Mr. Frutiger or Mr. Zapf?</blockquote>
If so, Linotype must have had it through Stempel (Frankfurt, Germany) because they did the drawings for most of the Linotype faces in Europe, including those by Zapf and Frutiger.
In Germany, the use of the word Hamburg for comparative use is at least as old as Wetzig’s „Handbuch der Schriftarten“ Albrecht Seemann Verlag, Leipzig, 1926.
