body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was hoping to use Hoefler's Chronicle Display Condensed for website
  headlines. Unfortunately it seems that their license doesn't allow that with font-face.
  So I am looking for an alternative. As I mentioned, it will be for headlines, should
  be web embeddable through font-face, it has to have a certain old style, classical
  look to it, look good in uppercase even at large sizes and preferably condensed.
  The most important feature would be that it has to have a very well balanced Q,
  as in I'd prefer the Q tail to be a base that the letter's body rests upon.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance! "

    consider <a href=\"http://www.webtype.com/font/millerheadline-light-family/\">Miller
    Headline</a> for @font-face from Webtype. Same genre as Chronicle. Not as narrow
    as the Condensed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for that! While Miller seems to be a perfect font for the job, unfortunately
    the Q is very important, as it will be the first letter in the main headline and
    possibly made into a favicon. So it has to be able to also \"stand\" on its own.
    That's why I'd prefer its tail to be some kind of base, in a serpent/ recumbent
    'S' shape that only touches the body. So that would leave out the long vertical
    tails and even the 'Z' shaped tail like the 'Q' in Baskerville.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/q_4087.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    this is just to show you what I'm talking about. I think the Q from Chronicle
    would have been perfect(first in the image), alas it's not going to happen. I
    found two other fonts and are somewhat close, however in the second one(Elisabeth),
    the Q tail seems overwhelming and in the last one, from Bitstream, the letter
    seems too weak.\r\n\r\nAny further help would be really appreciated."
