  body: It's similar to a "cocacolaii", "coca cola" "Loki cola" style font which is
    based on the Spencerian/Palmer (1850 era) scrip/penmanship.  In most cases you
    will need to add a swash character which comes as part of the char map for the
    fonts above.  Unable to find an exact match but I hope this helps.

  body: "Thank you, Incense, for your suggestion...\r\n\r\nSo taking that into consideration,
    my search has lead me to a font called \"Coronet\" and this:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casino2_4014.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow,
    it's not close, but I now believe it has been connected together, \"squooshed\",
    and then \"swashed\"- or does that seem to be too much?\r\n\r\nHow can you identify
    the original font when it has been manipulated so much? Is there a way?"

    out Metroscript as an option:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/metroscript/"
