  blush I thought it was House's Bullet, but pretty quickly figured out it's not.

    shadows and reflections make it look a bit different, but it seems to have all
    the right letterforms at first look. What differences convinced you it wasn't?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Originally, it was because the L has a small upturn at the end that I thought
    Bullet didn't have. Now, however, I've discovered that Bullet Small Caps Alt has
    a straight L. Also, the right hand leg of the R has a small hump in it that Bullet
    doesn't have. But now that I'm looking at it in more detail, I guess it can't
    really be anything else. Must've just been some massage on the designer's part.\r\n\r\n--\r\n<em>Spencer
