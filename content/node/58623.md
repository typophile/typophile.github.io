  body: "I'm fairly sure - sorry Geoff - that it isn't Adobe Garamond. Although it's
    a close match to the printed piece, Adobe Garamond's upward-tilting top-stroke
    of the <strong>5</strong>, and the unclosed bowls of the <strong>6</strong> and
    the <strong>9</strong> rule it out.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, Peter Baker's Garamond-esque
    freeware font for medievalists, [[http://junicode.sourceforge.net/|Junicode]],
    or its predecessor JuniusModern, from the [[http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/index.html|Old
    English Font Pack]] (which had the old-style numerals in default position, rather
    than as an opentype option, as in Junicode).\r\n\r\n[[http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/8528/picture2a.png|See
    this image of the relevant Junicode characters]]."
