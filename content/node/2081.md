body: I know that QWACK, has a feature called white trap. So it spreads the white
  when setting on a dark BG within a 4 color document. Say if I had my blacks set
  to 50 40 30 100, and I didnt what the other colors bleeding inside my white reversed
  out text. <BR> <BR>Does InDesign have something like this? Im looking, but it is
  not called White trap, so not sure what it is, or if it is available. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: Kyle, I&#39;ll take a look tomorrow. Which version of InDesign are you using.
    I don&#39;t think they changed the print engine very much but they might have.
    Also see if you can contact Thomas Phinney, he&#39;d know for sure. Dan

  body: I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know. This kind of question would be good to ask
    in Adobe&#39;s InDesign user forum at <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com" target="_blank">http://www.adobeforums.com</a>

  body: Kyle - Did you search for &#34;trap&#34; using InDesign&#39;s html-based <BR>help
    system &#40;which is pretty decent&#41;? There is an entry titled <BR>&#34;Trapping
    with blacks and rich blacks&#34;.

  body: Have done all this, and adobe&#39;s forum was a major bust, no reply yet.
    <BR> <BR>It might not have this feature, but it seems it should. I couldnt find
    anything in the .pdf help.
