    there are hardly bytes that are the same. The file format is different, the character
    map system is different, the looking up of glyphs is different, and the encoding
    of individual glyphs itself is <em>vastly</em> different.\r\n\r\nYou need to know
    anything concrete? Locate Apple's The TrueType Font File (a Microsoft Word document!
    How quaint!) and Adobe's Type 1 Format. Read them both, and you'll see how very
    little they actually have in common."
