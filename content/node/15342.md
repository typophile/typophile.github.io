body: "I recently received a style guide. This was the opening salvo:\r\n\r\nThe new
  Sprint logo expresses the joy of choice and flexibility that is the embodiment of
  our core positioning. The symbol reflects a sense of dynamism, fluidity and forward
  motion.\r\n\r\nThe proud. gestural form of the symbol also evokes qualities of confidence
  and optimism. The overall shape of the symbol connotes an arrow head or a bird in
  flight, a dramatic flourish or a flag waving at the finish line. The symbol reflects
  convergence and a broad array of customer offerings.\r\n\r\nThe new logo also builds
  upon the heritage of our company. The symbol is reminiscent of the Sprint \"pin
  drop\" and the use of Nextel yellow and black is bold, differentiating and ownable
  within our category.\r\n\r\nHere's what <a href=\"http://pages.sbcglobal.net/pbc1313/temp/sprint.html\">they're
  talking about.</a>\r\nI find it sinister. Thoughts?\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: The symbol is reminiscent of the "yellow badge" and the use of yellow and
    black is therefore bold, indeed.

    body: The logo conflates the miracle of birth with the power of heavy earth-moving
      machinery to carry the customer on a journey through the warmth and security
      afforded by reeling in fuzzy bunny tummies and the tear drops of martyred saints.

    professionals is what shocks. The rigorous, yet puerile language is simply over-confident.\r\nMarketers

    it's inept marketers who are the bane of existence. They have been inbreeding
    for years and can only produce pin-heads at this point.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I am not
    against brilliant marketers such as Aaron Burns, Phineas Taylor Barnum, and of
    course, Walt Disney. Each completely redefined consumer purchasing criteria through
    creativity and thoroughly delighted us in return.\r\n\r\nOh Aaron, where art thou...\r\n"

    dealt with enshrines his philosophy that the public are idiots. There are other

    doesn't want to come, you can't stop them.\""
