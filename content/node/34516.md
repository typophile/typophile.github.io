  in <em>The New York Times</em>:\r\n\r\n<em>Mr. Weber invented a number of typographic
  and graphic techniques, but none was more popular than the one that made two-dimensional
  photographs seem to spring off the page. It was used frequently during the late
  1960s by underground poster artists to give their artwork a psychedelic look.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Called
  posterization, the technique involved converting black-and-white or color photographs
  into a series of three separate negatives, each designated for a different color.
  They were then printed together, each slightly off register. The resulting images
  appeared to be multidimensional. (The effect cannot be shown in black and white.)</em>\r\n\r\n<em>In
  1942 Mr. Weber invented and patented a photographic device that could change the
  appearance of gothic lettering by, among other things, expanding, compressing or
  ballooning it. The device helped to start a trend in special-effects lettering.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Another
  of his signature methods took continuous-tone photographs \u2014 including portraits
  and product images \u2014 and converted them into fine-line renderings, making them
  appear as pen-and-ink drawings or engravings. These and other techniques were known
  together as the Weber Process.</em>"

    man was M.J. Weber.\r\n\r\nAlso, the obit states, \r\n<em>He opened Martin J.
    Weber Studios on Madison Avenue in the early 1930s as an art and production service
    for advertising and editorial clients. In the late 1940s and early '50s, Mr. Weber
    produced the original on-air nameplates for the CBS, ABC and NBC television networks
    before they adopted their more famous logos.</em>"

    color, but it can be shown.
