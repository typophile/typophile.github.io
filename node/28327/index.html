  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello, people! 
I&rsquo;m currently designing a book that is, actually, the compilation of a conference about the quantum physics of consciousness, with some of the biggest thinkers on the subject. I got the cover illustration approved, already, it&rsquo;s something concerning the &ldquo;Schrödinger&rsquo;s cat experiment&rdquo; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat</a></p>
<p>Trying to follow my current type bible, Bringhurst&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elements&hellip;&rdquo; I have been really cracking my head to get a meaningful typography to match such an interesting subject. Nationality is an issue, though. The conference was held in Switzerland, with a German theoretical as chairman, and had participants from Austria, England, US, Chile, among others. But the book will be published in Germany by a German institute identified with the school of Ulm and stuff&hellip;</p>
<p>So, the situation is:
I have this feline cover
I have this very contemporary and international (but with a german &ldquo;output&rdquo; if you allow me) text, with lots of people talking, the speech goes from one participant to the other, like in a play, I have to keep clear who is speaking at the time.</p>
<p>First of all I considered Otl Aicher&rsquo;s rotis. Besides the author biography I think the semi serif really has a feline feel. I thought of doing the whole book taking advantage of the many versions of rotis. But when I started to layout the inside text body the rotis serif didn&rsquo;t really behave as I expected. Besides, the version I have do not include text numbers and de fi and fl ligatures cannot be right.</p>
<p>Then I changed my mind and thought of Glypha and Univers. But recently I decided not to be so hard on the obligation of a german design for the text body. My dynamic duo is, currently, Avenir and Chaparral. Avenir is looking good in the cover and they look good together in a test inside page I did, with side notes. What do you guys think? 
Thank you for commenting or just reading this troubled mind!
Marco</p>

For instance, take TheSans and TheSerif, and make a new typeface from them, which uses OpenType contextual alternate coding to randomize which of the two &ldquo;typefaces&rdquo; any particular character is set in.
(Dead cats have no serifs.)
Thomas Phinney knows how to do this kind of thing.</div>

I know interaction is supposed to supercede mere depiction of an idea, but if you&rsquo;re familiar with the concept in a classical way, interaction is a trite hassle. It&rsquo;s like having to mouseover a CS logo in the OS X dock and they all look the same even after what is it, three years?! when having it spelled out would work better. So the illustration of superimposed cats works very nicely.</p>

<p>I think you are having a Milli Vanilli moment. This idea has already been done by Tal Lemming in Christian Schwartz&rsquo;s LOCAL GOTHIC. You have seen this before. I hope your failure to provide attribution is simply an oversight.</p>
<p>Lemming told me over lunch that most of the information on his website is simplistic smoke and mirrors but the basic ideas are deeply rooted in a quantum physics. You see, the problem with producing a &ldquo;random&rdquo; effect in OpenType is that the GSUB table is static. There is no way to, as Just van Rossum and Erik van Blokland did in BEOWOLF, link to a pseudo-random number generation library. This prevents the generation of a random seed which in turn causes the utter failure to launch a randomization routine. Most of the attempts at randomization, and I believe that Phiney&rsquo;s attempts fall into this category, use simple glyph rotation schemes or very simple backtracking to trigger a single substitution. What Lemming stumbled onto was a way to simulate a random seed generator. From there it was a fairly simple set of steps for him to implement a basic superposition algorithm. I shouldn&rsquo;t give away any more secrets as he explained all of this in confidence.</p>
<p>Will you be in Lisbon? We should have a beer together.</p>
<p>BTW, do you know Professor Andreas Von Shinn of the Hochschüle of Fachhochschule Darmstadt?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I claimed to have invented the idea of random variation from a set of alternates. (Making it work in a digital font is another matter.)
The first time I came across it was Kozmik the Flipper font, over ten years ago.
I have no idea how truly random Tal&rsquo;s &ldquo;random seed generator&rdquo; is, but it sounds way kewl.
John Butler has done something for the OT version of LettError&rsquo;s Kozmik.
I didn&rsquo;t mention either (and there are probably more) &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t think it was an issue.
In fact, I published a typeface, Handsome Pro, in 2004 that has many contextual alternates, triggered by a variety of cues, that gives a good random effect &ndash; there are quite a few script fonts that do this.
The only ostensibly random OT technique I have looked at is Mr Phinney&rsquo;s.
Sorry, not going to Lisbon. But a beer is always a good idea.</p>

As a rounded face, it looks kind of scientific/technical, but with classic lettershapes and small x-height it matches the tone of Chaparral. Also, I think that a rounded face has a good contrast with a slab &ndash; it&rsquo;s difficult to choose a contrast face for a slab, as the monoline quality is close to sans.</div>

Kon, I&rsquo;m using InDesign CS2. No, not that much math, or I&rsquo;d have to learn TeX, or something like that, right? :)<br>
Well, people, thank you very much for your help, I&rsquo;m finishing the book this weekend. This forum is a beautiful thing.</div>
