  body: Incidentally, that K was an alternate character the original Letraset version
    that doesn&#39;t seem to have made it into the digital version. I&#39;m guessing
    this logo goes back to the days of rub-down type. It would be easy to modify the
    digital version if you&#39;re trying to recreate it.

  body: I&#39;ve never liked Cortez much. I thought it looked like it was already
    out of style when it was new in 1977.
