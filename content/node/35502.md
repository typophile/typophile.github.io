body: "So I got bored and decided to ttry my hand at making a fraktur face.  However,
  I decided to see how well I could get it to \"match\" my antiqua font Coru\xF1a.
  \ Obviously I ran into a few issues when trying to juxtapose antiqua and fraktur.
  \ First, the fraktur is naturally a lot close of a font, with more thick lines than
  antiqua, as well as a lot \"busier\".  I decided I wasn't going to remove the essence
  of the fraktur script, and insterad focus on designing one that works as a perfect
  compliment to Coru\xF1a \u2014 an interesting task given that Coru\xF1a has a very
  low x-height and very large descenders and ascenders, very uncommon for fraktur.
  \ So, rather than expand the fraktur to match the width and colour of the antiqua,
  I slightly reduced its weight.  The long descenders have the same feel as the antiqua
  ones, so I think it was somewhat successfull, especially when I squint my eyes and
  I can't pick out a given word as being fraktur, so the colour is matched well.\r\n\r\nThe
  main thing I'm thinking is that I might not have the perceived x-height quite lined
  up, and that maybe my x's descender should be of the type that wraps back around
  under the x itself..  What do y'all think?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My first impression is that the combination looks kind of weird, because
    normally (i.e. in old books) it is exactly the other way around: few words in
    roman face turn up in the majority of the text being set in Fraktur. \r\nx: try
    wrapping back the descender, I don't think that it is a problem when this descender
    is not as long as the other ones. \r\ni: why no dot? This makes your face even
    harder to read. If you really need a \"dotless i\" glyph, put it in this position\u2026
    ;-)\r\ns: is there a long s variant planned? this would solve some of the s\u2019s
    problem that appears to be too dark. Also, the whole glyph looks rotated left
    compared to the antiqua s. And try to improve the kerning (see the word \"test\"
    for what I mean).\r\n"

  body: "Okay I uploaded a new sample file.  This one is from the Wikipedia article
    for Spanish, with all text directly related to Spanish in Antiqua and the rest
    in Fraktur.  Punctuation is also still the Antiqua version, but probably won't
    change too significantly.  I gave the i and j their dots back and finished up
    the uppercases except for X.  I used a rudimentary regex sequence to put in the
    long-s's so they might not be 100% accurate but I think it gets the majority of
    them, at least to preview the font.\r\n<code>s/s/\u017F/g\r\ns/\u017F /s /g\r\ns/\u017Fp/sp/g\r\ns/\u017Fk/sk/g\r\ns/\u017Fd/sd/g</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    spacing on the \u017F when by itself is too much, although I think I might have
    all of the letters a little too closely spaced even for Fraktur.\r\n\r\nOther
    than a lot more work on kerning does anyone see anything major (or minor) to look
    at?  I'm still trying to get a good wrap-around lowercase x, but no luck yet.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    is it working?  Waste of time? Success?\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan

  body: I cannot see a relationship between the two especially except for a certain
    romantic feeling. The 'Fraktur' seems like an 18th cent Romantic blackletter.
    I would not worry about the relationship of the two because realistically the
    two are unlikely to be used together. As to success of the black letter - i found
    it pretty easy to read. That's a good start to be sure. What do you want people
    to be able to do with it? Until you have a target you can't hit one.

  body: "Dennis hit the nail on the head.\r\n\r\nI was quite bored, but, since my
    dad is a math professor, I figured I'd try to extend my font for math typesetting
    (although this down the road) which does require fraktur.  And why do just the
    standard 5-6 letters for math when you can do all 53?  :-)  Actually it was kind
    of fun.\r\n\r\nSo part experiment, part boredom, and part practical.  I figured
    I might go really out there and do a s\xFCtterlin to match the antiqua italic
    haha.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta
