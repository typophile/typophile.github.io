    that indeed would be nice, wouldn\u2019t it? ;-)\r\nBut I\u2019ve suggested it
    mainly because it has several uncial characteristics (which people tend to see
    as Irish), along a geometric construction (which could relate to a big modern
    city like New York)."

  body: I find it a bit chilly, but I guess that's OK, as the font is a bit chilly.
    I dislike the W rather a lot. The hard angle at the lower left of the b is inauthentic.
    The hard angle at the top left of the F is inauthentic too; follow the f. Same
    for capital B and L. The ascenders of capital B, H, K, L rise above caps height
    in many Gaelic fonts.
