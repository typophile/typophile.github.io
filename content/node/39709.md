  body: "This would be the time for someone involved in the Mexican font scene to
    chime in. Saw at TypeCon how active the Mexican font scene is, but unfortunately
    it's not easy to learn much about it here (US). \r\n\r\nYou sample looks like
    a font, but I don't think it's anything we see in the English-speaking font sites.
    As for it's beauty, or lack of it, it only matters if it sells mexicana cola.\r\n\r\n-
