  to provide tuition in one of the main software packages such as Fontlab.\r\n\r\nWe
  would like to design a font and have a very strong idea on how it should look but
  are not very competent with the various technical rules of font design or the use
  of the software.\r\n\r\nWe are both students based in London and can pay around
  \xA36 per hour for the tuition.  We are flexible in terms of the tuition time and
  place.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us if you can help."

    was the problem.\r\n\r\nWhat about getting yourself a book or two? Have a look

    is to teach yourself. Most of what you already know is trasferable, and - \"When
    alse fails, read the manual.\"\r\n\r\nIf and when you do get stuck, specific questions
    tend to get answered here quickly and in detail.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-\r\n\r\n"

    get a Reading student (MA Typeface Design programme) to tutor you. But most of
    the other folks who really know this stuff would charge several times that....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
