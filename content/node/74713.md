  hoping that this community can help me solve a font identification problem that
  is driving me nuts.\r\n\r\nMany public buildings in the Los Angeles area use the
  font in sign I've pasted below.  I always notice it on the side of one particular
  Los Angeles Department of Water and Power building.\r\n\r\nI've used a bunch of
  online identification tools, including whatthefont and identifont, but neither of
  them came up with anything close.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSean\r\n\r\nHere
  is a link to the flickr account at which I found the original image, if you want
  a larger version.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/misternaxal/2516247415/sizes/l/in/photostream/"
