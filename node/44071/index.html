		<div class="commentbody">My co-worker was recently accepted to RISD. She told me the program was very practice/business oriented. The curriculum and the alumnus also seemed pretty impressive. It's rather expensive, but those four letters on your resumé can get you in the door anywhere. I believe they only accept 6-8 per year.

Sorry, not much info on SVA. I think Sagmeister teaches there still. Bring your band-aids.

(my co-worker ended up going to NC State, which has a much more theory-based approach. After one achieves state resident status, it's under 3,000 a year!)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If I were going to head off to either of these great schools, it would really come down to my long-term goals and what faculty and classes would be most likely to help me achieve those goals. On the other hand, if I were just going to grad school for the sake of going—which is by no means a bad reason—I would choose RISD just to avoid the distractions that New York offers. I’d never get any homework done in a city with so many bookstores, theaters, museums, and a such a great opera company.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. I don't know about either of these schools from personal experience, but so far this thread does overlook a couple of strengths of SVA. First, it draws faculty from the best professionals in the New York area, which is a great center of graphic design. Second, if you are in New York, I would think you have more of a chance for direct contact with that culture, both though your teachers and directly. It seems to me like more of an opportunity rather than a distraction, but whether Manhattan fits with your personality is a serious question. Some don't want to be anywhere else, for some it's a punishment. Since they are both fine schools, I think Manhattan vs Providence is a serious factor to consider.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Certainly they are both great and very competitive schools, there's no reason not to apply to both. If you get into both... well that's a nice choice to have to make. New York might offer more options for internships and such because the design industry is so much more established here; on the other hand there is a lot more competition for such jobs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's not what you learn, which is mainly up to you wherever you are, but rather the mentors and intern opportunities to be utilized...if you want to work in New York, go to a New York school and get your resume rolling with the crucial help of mentors and internships...if you don't want to work in New York, then don't enroll there...it's really that simple. 

But why do you need graduate study at all? No job requires it, except of course teaching. If you want to design, you do so on the job, not in the classroom!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We have had plenty of grad school vs. no grad school threads. There are pros and cons either way and the person choosing is the only one who knows truly the answer. Analyzing why you may want to go to grad school will help you decide which one is best for you. The job you are interested in may not be the sole reason to make a decision. Sometimes grad school is a good choice after you have worked in the field a few years and are looking for a break that has redeeming values beyond just a vacation from work-a-day life.

		<div class="commentbody">To those of you who are design educators out there: Do you feel that where you received your Graduate degree from had an impact on your ability to find a teaching position? In other words, if I want to teach (and practice on the side) should I plan on getting my MFA from a program that is highly-selective and full-time (SVA, RISD, Tyler, MICA, etc.)? Or is an MFA from schools like <a href="http://www.marywoodmfa.com/index.html">Marywood University</a>, <a href="http://www.pubinfo.vcu.edu/artweb/CDE/mfa_home.html">VCU</a> or NC State just as good?

		<div class="commentbody">I currently go to SVA. Despite the constant love hate relationship, the professors make the school well worth it. To be studying closely under some of my idols has been an amazing experience, let alone all the other amazing people they have introduced us to. I currently have a few grad students in some of my classes doing a three year plan. The program is focused on designer as author, pushing students to create some sort of product/ thesis. I have no idea what RISD's grad program is like, but I can't really imagine leaving new york anymore, ever. The MFA studios here are pretty nice, much better than undergrad, and they're open 24/7. </div>
