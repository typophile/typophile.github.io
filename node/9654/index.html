  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi again. been long time since last time. <BR> <BR>I've been asked to create a logo for a new domotic company. The owner basically want an image of friendly, easy, kind, affable, to surmount the idea of domotic = complexity, difficult, unaccesible&hellip;etc <BR> <BR>I've done few sketches in that way <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66885.jpg" alt="domo1"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66886.gif" alt="d2"> <BR>The second is maybe more technological and less toy, more serious. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66887.gif" alt="d3"> <BR>More simple. <BR> <BR>Just wanted to try an alternative way, more conceptual of domotic as central access and management and interconection, intelligence,etc.. <BR>I know it's distant from what's asked for, but what do you think about showing also this? Doesn't it keep the idea of simplicity and cleaness? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66888.jpg" alt="d4"> <BR> <BR>thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I'm not sure that the Bauhaus-esque face you are using suggests the &quot;friendly, easy, kind, affable&quot; because of it's intensely rigid structure. Humanist typefaces are what this is about. <BR> <BR>THe typeface you have used for the top 3 ideas is simple and clean, but lacks a human touch. <BR> <BR>As far as a good typeface to use, i will have to have a think about that, and figure out what &quot;domotic&quot; means.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Domotic is dom(icile aut)o(ma)tic, I believe. I think that anyone considering that would prefer to use a company that represents itself in a hi-tech manner, therefore the bauhaus/chalet is more appropriate. The icon is another matter, your first icon represents to me a broadcast, whereas your last posts are a bit martial arts, I like the network/molecular structure of your fourth icon you could develop it for a more user-friendly, human feel, alternatively you could use a hand-in-control icon (whether as a click of the fingers or hand holding remote - heavily simplified) or use type to illustrate, your third logo is approaching this if the L was using the O as a button, although the radiating curves need work. <BR>Tim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thank you for your post, you have some good ideas. <BR> <BR>Domotic is a mix of Domestic and Robotic, a more succesful term than &quot;intelligent buldings&quot;. <BR> <BR>i found too the martial arts position and would be changed by a normal standing man. I consider it ok as showing man having control in an easy way.  <BR>My personal favourite is the network icon, althouh you're right: it lacks of human feel. i'll work on it. and, finally, it's a good idea the finger/hand holding remote for the third logo. will see what can i do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the type in the first set, but just the type in 'domotica' (both types). The second set seems too soft and overly-humanistic to me. <BR> <BR>But more importantly, the images you're using don't seem related enough to domotics and their purpose/benefits. I can see the connections you're making, but without the explanation they don't read quickly for me. Perhaps you could use something like the <a href="http://www.aiwaz.net/Leonardo/vitruvianman/">Vitruvian man</a>. The idea of the human being central in a system, and having their abilities extended. Or perhaps you could emphasize the harmony between the person and their home (enabled by domotics). That would lead towards icons representing home. <BR> <BR>Also, I think the image of a remote is a negative, unless the remote is very unique and recognizable. (But maybe that's just me: I've got about 7 remotes at home, I don't want another one.)</div>
