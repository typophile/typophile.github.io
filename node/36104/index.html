  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Just today I read an article regarding the worth of design school.</p>
<p>I am currently looking at several design schools and their graphic / communication design departments.</p>
<p>One school in particular will end up costing $80,000. Most of which will need to be covered by loans. At 34 years of age, this potential burden causes me anxiety, even though I&rsquo;d love to attend this school and know the school&rsquo;s reputation will help open doors.</p>
<p>I think what was missing in the previous forum was an answer to the question: Does a design school education and the job opportunities available in graphic design warrant being in debt for many many years?</p>
<p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>From what I can tell there are a lot more design school graduates than there are good design jobs in desirable locations, so no. As Patty said, one does not need a design degree to become a designer. You can also take plenty of design classes as a continuing education student and get some sort of certification for a lot less than the cost of attending design school.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Putting aside what I think about design school, bear in mind that designer salaries start (I think&hellip;) at around $35,000 or so and most of them top out well below a hundred grand, even with 10-20 yrs experience. So do you really want to go into that kind of debt? Where&rsquo;s the pay-off? Ain&rsquo;t exactly law school, and you don&rsquo;t need to be certified in order to practice.</p>
<p>Check out AIGA&rsquo;s salary survey for your area to get more accurate figures than I listed above.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At the agency I worked at, one of my jobs was to evaulate and hire young production artists, graphic designers and art directors. Really the only 2 things I thought about were, the Book, and the Personality. I think if your book is very convincing, and you&rsquo;re not a wienie, you&rsquo;ll do ok—with or without design school.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned enough to get my first design/AD jobs without getting through the Vis Comm program at the Alberta College of Art and Design though. Just remember, there&rsquo;s a big difference between learning TOOLS, and learning aesthetics and the principles behind using design to communicate. Sometimes the only way to that superb portfolio is the long way. Learning and doing.</p>
<p>Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t try to rely on this schools' rep to get you hired. Maybe THAT&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>

<p>Art Center in Pasadena is the school I have been thinking of attending. I&rsquo;ve taken quite a few of their Art Center at Night classes, and have grown exponentially. I love the school, but I just feel like the cost would never pencil out in the long run.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more inclined to return to North Carolina and apply to NC State&rsquo;s design program for a 2nd bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Much cheaper and the student and faculty work looks up to par with what I&rsquo;ve seen at Art Center (except for Art Center&rsquo;s Trans / Product design and Illustration folks, they are really awesome).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;ve heard lots of good things about NC State&rsquo;s design program over the years. And schools that have accelerated study for more &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; newcomers entering the field are also quite often strong, in my opinion. I went to art/design school when I was 17, so I can&rsquo;t advise out of personal experience. But over the years, I&rsquo;ve been at three design schools, graduated from one, and about to start in a fourth program in the UK. I like design education, I guess you could say.</div>
