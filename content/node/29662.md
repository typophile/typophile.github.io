body: "When I generate this typeface as an OpenType PS there are no problems, and
  it works properly.\r\n\r\nThe thing that seems peculiar to me is when I scroll across
  the type to select in InDesign or Illustrator (or whatever), it goes from baseline
  to baseline from one line to the next. \r\n\r\nAs it's a script the characters are
  all different sizes, so the Ascender, Descender, Cap height and x height values
  are all pretty arbitrary, but the ascender and descender values do add up to 1000.
  The fonts' UPM size is 1000.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any idea why the type is selected
  like this?\r\n\r\nHave I entered some incorrect values? please see the pics.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scroll_4717.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/met1_4011.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/met2_4820.jpg]"

  body: well the problem with this article is that the solution is still out to the
    jury, but it describes the problem very well.

  body: "from what i understand (someone correct me if i'm wrong)\r\n\r\nunder the
    latest thinking, the equation should be this:\r\nTypoAscender + TypoDescender
    + TypoLineGap = WinAscent + WinDescent = hhea ascender (=WinAscent) + hhea descender
    (=WinDescent) + hhea line gap (=0(zero))\r\n\r\nnow hopefully that's clear and
    correct\r\n\r\nunder this scheme, nick would want to bump his TypoLineGap to 100
    to make all these things equal out. even then i'm not sure this would fix the
    problem as nick has described it."

    Paul and Chris for taking time to try to help, it's good to get advice from a
    couple of fellow 'bezier wranglers' Ha! Paul, I know you're a Script Meister yourself
    - love Allyson and Zaner Pro. \r\n\r\nI altered the metrics according to Paul's
    equation, minus the Typo Line gap and line gap, (is it necessary to have a value
    here?). \r\n\r\nCould the problem have something to do with 'Splats' extending
    above and below the bounding box? Or too many points in these characters?\r\n\r\nSee
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16296\">Olicana</a>\r\n\r\nThe type selects
    differently in different programs \u2013 see below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metsgrab_5889.jpg]\r\n\r\nIllustrator:(the
