  that explores the issue of language, using type to do so:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Erin_Kendig_Alphabet_Pile_web_5194.jpg]\r\n\r\n(details)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/word-pile-newer-LRG-detail_3687.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/word-pile-mountains_newer_4337.jpg]\r\n\r\nThought
  some of you might enjoy this.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm showing the piece at Soil (http://www.soilart.org)
  an artist-run gallery in Seattle, Washington. If you are in the Seattle area, stop
  on by.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to all of you for all the wonderful knowledge you bring
  to this great resource!\r\n\r\nErin Kendig\r\nwww.littleredgirl.com\r\n"
