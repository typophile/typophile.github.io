  body: Actually, it isn&#39;t. The &#39;A&#39; is different.

  body: I would agree that although there are a few inconsistencies that the distorted
    N ... figures ... cap G ... ugly K ... that this is Railroad.  <BR> <BR>That is
    until Chesh comes and corrects me. <BR> <BR>;&#41;

    1</a> &#40;scroll down the page&#41; is another possibility. It&#39;s free, so
    at least it won&#39;t cost anything to try it out.

  body: Railroad Gothic was also the best match I had came across... If it just wasn&#39;t
    for the &#34;A&#34;, yes... Then again, Cheshire Dave&#39;s suggestion, Headline
    One, hmm, it actually looks to be farther from matching... &#40;Also, dates don&#39;t
    match, as that font is from 2002, whereas the sample pic is from 1987... Now,
    the text on the side, &#34;Headline One is a replica of real newspaper headline
    type&#34;, that brings up some interest...&#41; Well, could it be that it was
    some previous version of Railroad Gothic maybe?...

  body: Judging by the date of the sample, it&#39;s likely that it is a pre-digital
    version of Railroad Gothic.
