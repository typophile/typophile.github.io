body: "There are a number of Unicode characters called combining or non-spacing marks.
  Here's a link to a list of them: http://bit.ly/1bVPnBU.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be
  nothing more than repeats of other unicode diacritics. For example the ogonek and
  ring (Unicode 02DB and 02D8) appear to be the same as Unicode 0328 and 030A. Some
  fonts, I've noticed, contain one range of these Unicode characters while others
  contain the other range.\r\n\r\nI'm confused as to why separate unicode designations
  exist for, what appears to be, the same characters. Maybe this is an obscure question,
  but can anyone here shed some light on it? Both Google and the search feature here
  seems to be failing me?"

  body: The spacing accent marks such as 02DB are legacy characters, included only
    for backwards compatibility with pre-Unicode standards. Unicode's preferred mechanism
    for handling diacritics is with non-spacing combining marks. If you look at precomposed
    diacritic characters in Unicode, you'll see that they all have canonical decompositions
    to base letters plus combining marks.

  body: "I have a slightly different take on the characters in 02B0-02FF. As John
    says, when used as accents, the combining diacriticals should used. But remember
    that some of the *glyphs* in the Spacing Modifiers have dual uses (I suppose a
    few do not), and such usage may call for a different *character*. Different character,
    different encoding, just like the Latin Capital Letter A and the Greek Capital
    Letter Alpha are always different characters, but often the same glyph.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    if I am <strong>referring to</strong> an ogonek rather than using it -- as in
    \"the ogonek is used in Polish, Navajo, and a few other languages\" I would set
    that ogonek (reference) using U+02DB. Otherwise, you're left with setting an extra
    space and the combining diacritic (U+0328), or using a huge kern with the combining
    diacritic (still probably preferable to putting it over a word space). As far
    as syntactic meaning goes, I think this better preserves things. YMMV."

  body: "Given that the fonts I opened with diacritics in the 02B0-02FF range were
    all older Type 1 fonts, I had a hunch a legacy issue was responsible. Thanks John!\r\n\r\nCharles,
    are you suggesting that it would be useful to include both in a font? I haven't
    done an extensive search, but I haven't stumbled across any that do."

  body: "Charles is right. I should have paid more attention to the original post.
    Many of the 02xx block characters are spacing modifiers, used in various notation
    systems. I was thinking primarily about the legacy spacing characters in the basic
    ANSI Latin set.\r\n\r\nFonts would mostly only need to support the 02xx characters
    if it were intended for specialist publishing in linguistics. The 03xx combining
    characters are more widely useful. I recommend including at least those that correspond
    to precomposed diacritics in a font, and to use these in composites rather than
    spacing characters. This will make future extensions of the font to support GPOS
    mark positioning easier."

    harder. Using Apple font tools, as Michel suggested, I turned up several fonts
    installed on my Mac with various equivalents in the 02xx and 03xx ranges.\r\n\r\nI'm
    assuming that the combining marks do not need widths assigned since it would seem
    to be irrelevant, whereas those in the 02xx range would need those widths, like
    other glyphs. Correct?"

    Most of the 100 or so publishers in the Association of American University Presses
    would find them useful. The people pushing whiter than white laundry products
    likely would not. Who are you aiming your fonts at?"

  body: Charles, I'm working on a general-purpose font family that includes Western/Central
    European, Cyrillic and Greek characters. That's really neither here nor there,
    but the diversity of the project, I suppose, has caused me to dig a little deeper
    than usual into things. It's mostly a combination of curiosity and making sure
    that I wasn't assuming something to be one thing and then finding out later on
    that it was actually something else.

    characters are specifically intended to be zero-width; it isn't just that there
    is no need for them to have widths, but they really shouldn't."
