  The original signage is circa 1906. (The EXIT sign at the bottom is from a renovation,
  circa 2000.) The closest match I've found is Anziano Pro. With the understanding
  that an *exact* match is highly unlikely, do you have any other suggestions for
  a match? Thanks in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signs_5225.jpg]"

  body: Yes, you won't find anything very similar because these were made by hand
    or with molds that were not based on any printed typeface and thus not digitized
    as a font available today. Your best bets are in the "<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/trajan/?affid=99346">inscriptional</a>"
    or "<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/titling_thorn_serif/?affid=99346">glyphic</a>"
    categories. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/beaufort_pro_family/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=96&sample_text=KING%20ST&affid=99346">Beaufort</a>
    may be closest.
