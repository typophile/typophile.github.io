body: I'm working on building kerning classes for my font in FontLab 4.5, and I was
  wondering if there was any sort of cheat sheet for what characters to class together
  for a normal text font. Thx

  body: "It really depends on your design. I think you are quicker if you pull over
    all glyphs of similar rightside/leftside forms into self-defined classes than
    starting with a existing classes and then figuring out which glyphs are placed
    wrongly, or are missing, or are placed in two classes (strictly forbidden) ...\r\nBut
    don't forget to make separate classes for leftside and rightside forms, and do
    not place a glyph in two leftside (or rightside) classes if you want to avoid
    error messages upon compiling the kern feature.\r\n\r\nThere was an older thread
    on class kerning (of January or so) which I cannot find. Also see <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18452\">this</a>."

    are some tips concerning kerning and kern classes in FontLab. You can also open
    other OT fonts and look at what they have done in terms of classes.\r\n\r\nGeorge

    Classes panel. The application will analyze the shapes of your letters and put
    those that have similar left and right sides into one class. You can decide if
    glyphs with different metrics should be combined or not. \r\n\r\nA."
