  design major at university. I am quite interested in researching the democratization
  of information (how we live in an age of information excess), but more specifically
  the effects that excess information is having on contemporary culture. Essentailly
  I would like the end result to be type based, because this is where my strengths
  lie. I am really quite confused and I was hoping that somebody on here might have
  some thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/M\\"

  body: "Brian,\r\n\r\nText, type, and information excess are all intimately related.
    Insofar as you would like to understand the impact of this excess on contemporary
    culture here are some resources that may help you understand more. You will find
    that they are of varying relevance and usefulness to your interests and efforts.
    Some speak about information glut, some about handling it, some are natural outgrowths
    of the fact that there is information excess.\r\n\r\n(Please indulge me I work
    in a library so making bibliographies, related reading lists etc. is something
    that I seem to be predisposed to doing...)\r\n\r\n<strong>Books</strong>\r\nThe

    (a good reading list)\r\n\r\nOkay I'll stop now. I suspect a literature review
    from the standpoint of content and presentation (by this I mean quantifying the
    number of articles about information age/excess/overload and also analyzing the
    trends of type and design in expressing this type of content -do layouts becaome
    more simple? fewer words? larger or smaller pages? etc- ) would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nYou
    might guess I am interested in the subject a great deal. Please share your work
    if you are able and feel free to contact me directly as well (jwhipple at telus
    dot net UTC -8 see my profile page).\r\n\r\nJon"

  body: "It was said that John Milton was the last scholar to have read every book
    in the library.\r\nSo information overload isn't a new problem.\r\nThe big picture
    of culture is not synthesized through dealing with original works, but through
    critical reviews. The Edinburgh Review, founded in 1802 (?) was a key publication
    in providing the big picture, although it did not reach the masses. I guess the
    salient point would be, what percentage of the literate public did it reach? In
    the era of mass literacy, look to publications like the Ladies Home Journal and
    the Saturday Evening Post in the US c.1900, and the role they played of making
    available democratically useful information in the \"Progressive Era\". I don't
    know what the comparable publications would be in NZ."

    or Anthropology in Design Education, personally the union of the two terms for
    your thread title makes me think of Design as a tool for environmental and social
    sustainability, you can read something on the subject on page 26 in: http://core.icograda.org/web/pdfs/BEDA_WhiteBook_2004.pdf'

    and Spectator of 1709-1712 (Dr Johnson estimated that at the time it closed the
    Spectator sold 1680 copies in London per day). Both were surprisingly well printed:

    subject to \"how we live in an age of information excess\"."
