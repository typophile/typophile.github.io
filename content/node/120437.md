  a historical aside, is there any information regarding mathematical typesetting
  of the period? I have seen the same style used in many texts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your assistance.\r\n\r\n"

      formulae, would you have any additional information as to how they were typeset?

  body: "Any of several Scotch Romans, including New Caledonia as suggested by Kevin.\r\nIn
    the days of metal typesetting, the character sets of a font were limited. To set
    special characters such as mathematical symbols the printer had to resort to an
    additional font of symbols, sometimes called, particularly in the US,  a \"Pi\"
    font because it usually included the letter \u03C0.\r\nI don't know if this particular
    page was hand set or in a font that could be used in a Linotype or similar machine.\r\nBy
    1957 photo-composition was replacing metal. So this is also a possibility for
    your page.\r\nFor a digital substitute there are specialized math fonts or you
    could use a Scotch Roman with a good math component. You might look at Nick Shin's
    Scotch Modern https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\r\nFor more info
    on typesetting you might start with this wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Kevin, I agree with your call of New Caledonia -- a Scotch Roman -- as the
    closest digital to the 1957 Italic subhead. The rest of the text is not detailed
    enough to say 100% but New Caledonia would certainly make a reasonable substitute.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the math, anyone familiar with TeX could use Computer Modern, as suggested
    by Michel. Some info on Computer Modern at\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern\r\nhttp://www.ctan.org/pkg/cm-unicode\r\n\r\nI'm
    not certain the math it could be set in New Caledonia or any of the other  Scotch
    Romans.\r\nI wonder which regular fonts might have this capability?\r\nDon"

    not sure what you consider a \u201Cregular\u201D font, but there are non-TeX fonts
    especially suited for setting math. Most notably Cambria Math and Stix (http://www.stixfonts.org).\r\nList

    meet the mathematical standards of that period. It would also be hard to reproduce
