    on hate speech. That's why I reacted so strongly.

  body: "Note my use of \"campaign\".\r\n\r\nReact strongly, please! But blocking
    is a different beast entirely. Which is not to say I absolutely opposed censorship
    - quite the contrary, I see a lot of problems with so-called \"free speech\",
    but what a person says and what a person is are different things, and blocking
    works off the latter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    forum and elsewhere whose opinions I differ with, and I thankfully live in a country
    where (presumably) these differences are tolerated - and sometimes embraced. \r\n\r\nI
    don't mean either to advocate blocking Dennis, I just had a wee little hope that
    someone had maybe actually done it and that was why we hadn't seen him in awhile...
    or that he had taken his crackpot intolerance elsewhere. Or that he'd been locked
    up for waving around those firearms he so fervently advocates."

    are none of those around here.\r\n\r\nJust remember, tolerance and opinions aren't
    necesarily linked.\r\n\r\nI can even tolerate sinners, since I can't seem to escape
    that category myself. But people like to label someone, and then throw on a bunch
    of baggage they assume goes with the label.\r\n\r\nAnd the only thing I fervently
    advocate is coffee.\r\n; )"

    walking down the alley in East LA, I encountered a bunch of the artists working
    on a wall, and found them to be a well-behaved group of strangely dressed, but
    clean and polite, young Mexican-American artists. Not threatening at all."
