  body: Yeah, I know. I'd also been reading the forums about why a *5*... still. Just
    noticed the change and am slightly sad. Always got a kick out of it.

  body: the 5 was for the 5th anniversary of typophile being 5/5/05. Now that typophile

  body: And now we approach 6/6/06 and have The Omen to remind us. Amazing they (re)made
