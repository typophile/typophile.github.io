  a book about Saudek by Taschen. \r\nI have two images, one of the cover, with an
  italic. And one (unfortunately small) image from two pages, with a swashed-serif.\r\nIdentifications
  would be appreciated a lot. :)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hm, it doesn't seem to be Hoefler. If you mean Hoefler Text. The 'k' is very
    different on the cover.

    maybe a bit of tweaking went on in illustrator/freehand?\r\n\r\nthe inside text
    is almost certainly adobe garamond regular alternate\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/8508/adobegaramondregularalternate-font.html"

    Text 'k', then they did a good job..\r\n"

  body: "The most obvious problem with the Galliard theory is that it doesn't match
    except for a similarity in the alternate characters. Look at the J and W, for
    example.\r\n\r\nI think the answer is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-garamond/\">Adobe
    Garamond</a>, which has the right alternate characters, like the a, e, n and ct
    ligature, as well as the same J and W.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    bolded futher.\r\n\r\nI went to the bookstore today, and looked at the inside
    a bit better, and the texts are indeed Adobe Garamond, with swashed alternates.
    Funny thing about it, they set <em>all</em> texts with the swashes... \r\nI would
    have known it was Garamond if I had looked better, but I was more after the cover,
    really. And that 'k' just didn't look like Garamond.\r\n\r\n"

    like some kind of variation on Hoefler black italic, but the S and the k are different...
    sigh...

  body: "Here is a simulation of Saudek made using Monotype Sabon Semibold Italic.
    I added 2.5 pts of stroke thickness and tightened the tracking for the last 4
    letters so that they touched. I think the serifs would not have been as blunted
    if the Bold weight was used, but apparently that's not in the Monotype version
    of Sabon. I also expect the letterform variation would be less if the proper starting
    weight was used.\r\n\r\nI think this makes a case that 'Saudek' on the cover is
    made from Sabon with some graphic manipulation.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SAudekSim_4876.gif]"

    Next</a> Extra Bold Italic. Thank you, Mike, for doing the research that led me
    to check Sabon Next. Usually, if a sample is this close to a typeface, but with
    this many modifications, it's more likely that it's a similar typeface rather
    than something custom because of the work required to do it right. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    be surprised to see the rest of the book is also set in Sabon Next -- it's got
    swash 'e's.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mls-2_5308.png]"

    be Sabon Next as well, I wouldn't be able to tell, because I don't really know
    the distinctive differences between the two. \r\nBut this face defenitely looks
    better then Adobe Garamond (the italics anyway, imo of course), when inspected
    closely like this.\r\n\r\nAnother mystery solved! ;)"

    now, Sabon Next, Extra Bold Italic.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to post, for good measure."
