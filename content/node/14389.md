  naming convention for these particular chracters. Let's see, they're four glyphs
  comprised of two superior capital characters with a large undescore... and I still
  don't know how to name them. \r\n\r\nCan someone help me include them into my typeface
  properly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-numan\r\n\r\n(I am refering to the black segments
