body: "It's currently 1:45am here in Cincinnati. I entered the studio a little after
  9pm thinking I would spend the night blissfully drawing letters, but I quickly got
  in over my head in a massive UPM quandary and have done nothing but sift through
  thread after thread and wiki after wiki. I am now enthusiastically frustrated with
  technicalities\u2014I eagerly want to understand everything, but each thread seems
  to give me more questions to consider and more technicalities to understand. I thought
  I had a better understanding of the technical aspects of type design than I did.
  It seems right now like I truly know nothing other than how to draw pretty letterforms\u2014if
  that.\r\n\r\nNonetheless I hope to have all of my uppercase letters drawn and digitized
  by next Friday so that I can display them in our Studio Show. My intention is to
  perhaps do something involving colored acetate, maybe an interactive lightbox where
  letters can be overlapped and juxtaposed freely so the audience can explore the
  various form relationships for themselves."
