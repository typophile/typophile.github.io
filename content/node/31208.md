body: "I\u2019m designing a font with lots of alternate characters. While playing
  around with Brioso pro, I noticed a cool little pop-up menu (triangle symbol on
  each glyph square) in the glyphs palette in Illustrator CS2 that showed a selection
  of alternates for each character that had them. I want this for my font! I did a
  little research and read that it had something to do with all alternates (aalt).
  So I looked at Brioso\u2019s OT coding and fumbled around with my own but alas,
  couldn\u2019t get it to work. To complicate things even more, I opened it up in
  InDesign CS2 and it recognized my alternates and gave me the pop-up. But no go in
  Illustrator. Could someone inform me how exactly to get get this working? It would
  be much appreciated!\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJosh "

  body: "Whenever you define any features in your font that produce 1:1 substitutions
    by some alternates (salt, ss01-ss20, swsh, hist, smcp, c2sc etc.), you should
    link these features to aalt in the following way:\r\n\r\nfeature aalt {\r\n  feature
    salt; \r\n  feature ss01;\r\n  feature ss02; \r\n  feature hist; \r\n  feature
    smcp; \r\n  feature c2sc; \r\n} aalt; \r\n\r\nAll the substitutions from the original
    features that have been linked into \"aalt\" will become available in the little
    popup menus of the Illustrator and InDesign glyph palettes. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nAdam"

  body: "The AFDKO feature syntax for \"aalt\" is special, unlike any other feature.
    Rather than duplicating all possible substitutions that are already defined in
    the font, Adobe created this shorthand notation for \"aalt\": the AFDKO compiler
    looks at the \"table of contents\" defined under \"feature aalt\", then checks
    all the feature definitions listed there, collects all the lookups associated
    with those features and maps them to \"aalt\". In other words, through the special
    \"aalt\" syntax, the font developer decides which of the lookups that are already
    defined in his font and are associated with some features should be also associated
    with \"aalt\". \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
