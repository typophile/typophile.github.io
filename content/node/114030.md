  new in this.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a typeface looking for a Avenir or Neutraface
  serif with transitional roman features. This exploration started when I'm trying
  to find a serif equivalent of Futura or Avenir without any success. When I started
  to design I altered the course of the original idea making half-rounded endings,
  and in each new re-design and corrections this typeface was getting more ornamented.
  I think to make it a text typography.\r\n\r\nI included a PDF with a sample text.
  Although I worked with some uppercase letters, this typeface's version doesn't include
  any one, I'll work on it after I make corrections on lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your comments."
