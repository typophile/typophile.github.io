body: "In the beginning of the latest iteration of this website, the edit feature
  was screwed up, in that an edit resulted in an updated time stamp which resorted
  the postings out of original order. I thought that was fixed. I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nHow
  hard is this to fix? Do we need to vote on whether this bug should be fixed?\r\n\r\nIf
  I missed prior discussion on this topic, please point me to the thread."

    or perhaps for 30 minutes tops. It's too easy to change the nature of the discussion
    by retroactively changing your comments.\r\n\r\nOf course the Situationalist in
    me thinks differently.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: Yeah, man, when is Punchcut gonna fix <em>everything</em> that is <em>wrong</em>,
    man? Are you doing it in your spare time or something? Huh? Do you have more important
    things to do, like <em>work</em>? Sheesh. With the insane monthly fees you're
    charging us poor users, everything should be just the way we want it to be.
