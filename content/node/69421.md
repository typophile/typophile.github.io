body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm designing an events programme for a youth arts
  centre. I'd like the subtitles on the cover to project three dimensionally as attached
  but there's something about it that doesn't quite work... is the contrast between
  the different shades too great? Are the titles too long for this sort of treatment?
  Is it simply because the font isn't designed to be used this way?\r\n\r\nCould anyone
  suggest a similar but more suitable font or recommend examples of 3D type I can
  refer to? I've used Helvetica Neue Black Condensed because it is within the corporate
  identity guidelines but have some leeway to introduce a new font if necessary. \r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\n"

    mixing an old iPod ad style, an old ink splatters style, and then piling on hyper-extended
    three-dimensional type in three colors. Then there\u2019s some all-lowercase type,
    light type, AND a logo that doesn\u2019t really work with most of the above. You
    need to pick a single idiom for this project instead of creating a mashup of dated
    styles."

  body: "Thank you for being so straight. It's obvious - now you've said it - but
    somehow I'd missed it. Or at least some of it; I realise the ink splatters are
    a bit dated and personally wouldn't use all-lowercase in this instance but they
    are key parts of the corporate guidelines. I see it as a challenge to incorporate
    them tastefully but clearly haven't achieved this as yet! I need to give this
    a lot more thought.\r\n\r\nMany thanks. "
