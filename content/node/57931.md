body: "I don't know if this is already posted here, but I saw this when browsing the
  web:\r\n\r\n<em>\"Ecofont\r\n\r\nThe prints we make for our 'daily use' not only
  use paper, but also ink. According to SPRANQ creative communications (Utrecht, The
  Netherlands) your ink cartridges (or toner) could last longer. \r\nSPRANQ has therefore
  developed a new font: the Ecofont.\r\n\r\n\"After Dutch holey cheese, there now
  is a Dutch font with holes as well.\"\r\n\r\nAppealing ideas are often simple: how
  much of a letter can be removed while maintaining readability? After extensive testing
  with all kinds of shapes, the best results were achieved using small circles. After
  lots of late hours (and coffee) this resulted in a font that uses up to 20% less
  ink. Free to download, free to use.\"</em>\r\n\r\nIt can be downloaded for free.
  To download and for more information, see here:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ecofont.eu/ecofont_en.html]]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you guys think of it?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn"

  body: Yeah, I remember reading an article somewhere that while eco font does help
    reduce ink usage, other fonts can actually reduce it even more without having
    to use a typeface with holes. Wish I could find the article again...

  body: "@frode frank. Thanks! I really like it too.\r\n\r\n@sii. It seems to me that
    putting holes or spaces into a character is not something they can claim is intellectual
    copyright. I'm sure there are plenty of examples of characters with holes in them
    \u2014 see an inverted Rosewood for example. Sure, the font file itself is their
    intellectual property, but you can't copyright a idea (at least under US law).
    It is like building a car. You can design a car to be environmentally friendly,
    but that doesn't stop another car maker from trying to make an environmentally
    friendly car too. In fact, an article on TypeRight seems to back up this line
    of thought <a href=\"http://www.typeright.org/feature4.html\" title=\"http://www.typeright.org/feature4.html\">http://www.typeright.org/feature4.html</a>.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, as you said, the wording appears to be gone from their site, so maybe
    they realized they couldn't enforce it. Nick is probably safe :)"
