  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m working with a vendor who has delivered a font that looks almost exactly like &ldquo;Font X&rdquo; that Adobe owns and sells. This font will be used by several of our vendors to create packaging, signage, collateral, etc.</p>
<p>Our vendor claims the font is a complete re-drawing of Adobe&rsquo;s Font X based on his own Font Y. Therefore this is not a pirated font. When I compare the outlines, I see the majority of the outlines exactly match Font X, with one or two points adjusted to make the serifs longer and the rounds wider.</p>
<p>Our company is committed to maintaining proper font licensing. We have had worked with several foundries that have allowed us to alter their fonts with the promise that we either purchase additional licenses or pay a flat fee AND that all our vendors must license the original font before using the altered font. We&rsquo;ve tried contacting Adobe but either get put on hold for hours or transferred to someone who cannot answer our question.</p>
<ol>
<li>Should I assume that Adobe will not allow this since their EULA is pretty clear?</li>
<li>Does anyone have a contact at Adobe who understands my question and can give me a definitive answer?</li>
<li>Does anyone have a link to language that I can pick up to share with my partners an explain why having similar outlines would violate our license?</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate your help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adobe has long allowed modifications, but the modified fonts must be licensed just like the originals.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, not all Adobe fonts are the same in this regard. See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/additional-license-rights.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/additional-license-rights.html</a>  and look for which fonts have the &ldquo;3&rdquo; note, and also consider the date the license was done. Sigh.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas is right. Standard caveat: I have never attended law school. I&rsquo;ve worked a lot with a handful of lawyers on matters related to type &amp; fonts, but if you have legal questions you may want to consult a real lawyer.</p>
<p>That said, it certainly sounds as though your vendor is violating Adobe&rsquo;s license (presuming they licensed it from Adobe in the first place) by distributing their modification.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a separate kind of potential violation here as well: Adobe applies for design patents on pretty much all of its original designs, and distributing a modification under another name would be a patent violation. Some of the patents have expired with time, and a few were never applied for, but this does sound dicey. If you want to contact me directly and tell me the name of the typeface in question I can tell you whether it has a current patent.</p>
<p>And in case that&rsquo;s not enough, there may also be copyright violations involved. In the U.S. that&rsquo;s limited to the software (which includes the outline points); in various European countries it also covers the designs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll offer two opinions, for what they&rsquo;re worth.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your vendor may well be violating one or more laws, and is either unethical or clueless. If you feel you need to retain a business relationship with these folks, watch your back.</li>
<li>If you use the modified font only in the vendor&rsquo;s projects and per their direction, I suspect any legal liability rests with them, not you.</li>
</ol>
<p>And thanks for asking!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks so much for your responses. This is the information I need to take back to my partners and explain why we are rejecting this font.</p>
<p>To be clear: no one has distributed the font yet. This is part of a proposed creative campaign from an outside ad agency. The agency came up with the idea and hired a freelancer to alter the font without consulting us. Now they will learn how foolish that was.</p>
<p>I suppose the agency could use the font on another campaign in the future since they&rsquo;ve paid for the work. If I see it showing up one day, I&rsquo;ll be sure to let Adobe know!</p>
