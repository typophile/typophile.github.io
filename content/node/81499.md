  body: "I'm glad to see you posted this here. One thought that occurred to me after
    I replied to your e-mail is that this may be a normal Bauhaus-style sans font
    that used a graphics trick to make it look tri-lined. I seem to recall someone
    here once describing a way to use Offset (or some other command) in Illustrator
    to create something looking like this with normal lettering. You make the white
    line just big enough to almost fill the blue letters, and you get this look. At
    least it seems feasible for monotone sans fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
