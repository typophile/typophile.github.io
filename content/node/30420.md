  traditional recipes? I am thinking of an uppercase, chunky serif. What do you think?
  Let me know your views. Thank you\r\nPS what about bodycopy inside? Surely that
  will have to reflect what is on the outside."

  body: Well this might be an issue only in the US but there are a lot of fractions
    in ingredient lists:1/4 cup, 1/2 teaspoon, etc. I design a lot of cookbooks and
    have learned it's best when I use a font that has the fractions built in (an expert
    collection) rather than having to create them myself. But like I said, with the
    metric system the measurements might be simpler.

  body: Of course, you can make fractions out of any font by using superscript and
    subscript. But the plus of using fonts with figures designed for fractional use
    is they are visually weighted to balance within the text.

    using fractions ... if you aren't going to use the font on the interior of the
    book it isn't so important. [grin] But, it is always a good idea to consider the
    fact that a typeface which you use on the cover might end up being used on the
    interior as well. In that case do consider a typeface that has figures designed
    for fractions.

  body: "Faz, if this is your first cookbook, I STRONGLY suggest you take yourself
    to the local bookseller and spend a few hours in the cookbook department. Cookbooks
    are really complicated and you should look at as many as you can to figure out
    what is and is not successful. They really have to be functional as well as attractive
    and you'll see pretty quickly which ones manage to be both.\r\n\r\nFor one thing,
    I think the ingredients need to stand clearly apart from any other text elements
    (headnote, directions, tips). People use them to make their shopping list and
    if they are buried in the recipe or not designed well they can be confusing. They
    are usually easier to read flush left/rag right than centered. Also, try to make
    the recipes fit on a single page or spread. It's a drag to have to turn the page
    mid recipe when your fingers are wet or sticky."

    with what you are doing with it. If there are photographs in the cookbook, you
    may want to see what they are and then \"marry\" (oh how we use to use that word
    a lot in typography) a type font to that artwork. Something that will complement
    rather than detract.\r\n\r\nSo truth be told, I don't think any suggestions at
    this point would help you, the client, the designer, anyone. A good manuscript
    with careful thought out page layout along with photos if there are any would
    be the starting point for selecting a typeface or two.\r\n\r\nP.S. Note to Miss
    Tiffany.\r\nI would like to offer you one tip from when we use to make fractions
    in typesetting - we would do the fraction in one weight up -- so the reduced numbers
    would maintain the same looking weight as the body copy. Just had to share."
