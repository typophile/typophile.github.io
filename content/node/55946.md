  how to make the type \"fan\" out on a path like they do on the left side of the
  chart. Does anyone know how to do this in Illustrator?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.quentindelobel.com/files/gimgs/20_carto.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    Illustrator, \r\n2) Rotate it 5 degrees, say, and copy,\r\n3) Repeat #2 until
    you have enough lines. At this point they will begin to look like the spokes in
    a wheel.\r\n4) Start typing on each line. :-)\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else knows
    an easier way. But that's how I would do it."

    implement that great old Freehand feature into Illustrator where you could specify
    a transformation, and then say to apply the transformation to so and so many copies
    of a given object? I always wonder if it's just me and I'm not finding it."

    to the Freehand feature.

  body: "The closest i get to that in illustrator is:\r\n\r\n1) made 2 circles, align
    them (easier to find the center in the small one)\r\n2) Use smart Guides to find
    the exact center\r\n3) make a path line, select it use rotate\r\n4) move the rotate
    point to the center of the small circle\r\n5) when u realese the button you choose
    your deggres, i made 2 for example\r\n6) After Command + D repear your last step,
    so keep pressing to make the pattern.\r\n7) type in each line your text (use Type
    on path option to find exact what you want)\r\nin my fast example i used on center

    Illustrator too.\r\n\r\n<em>\"i mean u can rotate the textbox, but the inside
    \r\ntext wont be rotating, except if they fixed that on newer versions\"</em>\r\nHey,
    I remember that, but indeed it appears to be working now in CS4.\r\nThat actually
    makes things pretty quick. No need to copy and paste in place &ndash; just make
    your one text box (or path) and then in the Transform/Rotate dialog hit \"Copy\"
    instead of \"OK\", then do the Command+D thing."

  body: "@type.nasos \r\n\r\nIt does work if you use the rotate function.\r\nAnd even
    smarter the Transform Each Function (Alt-Shift-Apple-D) so you can move and rotate
    at the same time."

  body: "This is the reaction directly from Quentin about how he made the chart:\r\n\r\n====================\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThis
    is really funny to see some people debatting on something I didn't sleep because
    of.\r\n\r\nSo, here is my \"hard\" way (you found the solution on the forum):\r\n\r\n1-
    draw one line, and then rotate with the angle you want.\r\n2- pathfind the lines
    with one circle to have the size you want.\r\n3- ungroup.\r\n4- link the lines
    with the threated text option (CS4, CS3?)\r\n\tSometime, the links between the
    text field are not really good. Try linking only 5 to 7 lines, after that you
    link the blocs each other. If it really doesn't work, try making it one by one
    (I did it :-S).\r\n5- You can now import your text.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n- no hyphenate
    (hand made in my case),\r\n- sometimes when you press \"enter\", the next line
    will jump 3 or 4 lines. To correct: double enter + apple (ctrl) Z\r\n\r\nI know
    it's quite complicated and not really quick. But I didn't find other way. So if
    you find something better?\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nQuentin\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot for your input.\r\n\xAE"
