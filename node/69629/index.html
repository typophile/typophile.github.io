  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">BOOK REVIEW: A Theory of Semiotics (Advances in Semiotics)
by Umberto Eco

http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Semiotics-Advances/dp/0253202175/ref=cm_cr-mr-img

Eco's "Theory of Semiotics" may well be a book of valuable content but I doubt if I will ever struggle through it to the end. The so-called "typesetting" is beyond pathetic for a University Press. It looks as though it were typed on an old 1970's Selectric ball typewriter which was badly in need of alignment. The text was appallingly slugged into the pages by an unskilled typist and then photo-copied numerous times to assure that reading it would cause pain and suffering to the hapless reader. The text is bold and blotchy with hiccups in letter alignment that makes one wonder if this were a low-tech pirated rip-off instead of the real thing. I would very gladly return this book if they would replace it with a text file that I could format myself and make readable. 

My apologies to Umberto because I am a fan of his work in semiotics but the dear folks at Indiana University Press and perhaps "General Editor" Thomas A. Sebeok, need a lesson in typography from Robert Bringhurst or a visit from nearby Miles Tinker for a sound flogging with a pica ruler.
