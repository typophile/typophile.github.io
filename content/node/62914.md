    Nadine did a fantastic job of demystifying the Arabic script and letting us get
    our feet wet by starting in on a type design. (It was fun, even if Naskh can be
    trying: http://www.arabictype.com/blog/2009/10/24/tdc-workshop-first-day/ !) I''d
    like to thank her for her patience and help over the past few days.'
