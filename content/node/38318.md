    be running out to get help on. You really need to figure out how to pick type;
    head over to the library and start looking through specimen books and type annuals
    for ideas."

    do you worry about this task ?

  body: "I was thinking a foetus idea, using the comma as a sign of the foetus, however
    that idea also symbolises the 'vodaphone' logo.\r\n\r\nthe font being frankfurtur
    as it has a double up status and could portray the feotus inside the womb and
    the placenta-double lining....\r\n\r\n\r\nbut ahhh."

  body: "Odds are he doesn't have access to Ed Interlocked, especially if he's just
    a college kid. I think the standard at most design school's is an Adobe Collection
    made specifically for colleges (or at least that was what we had.)\r\n\r\nI remember
    doing these type treatment projects. I was actually pretty fun, because you don't
    have to be so fickle with type setting. It was a very creative use of type as
    symbols. Don't look at the letters as letters, look as them as pen/paint brush
    strokes. Create an image using light whispy calligraphic characters and then use
    bold fonts to fill in and build up the shadows/highlights. Think like you're using
    a pattern brush in Photoshop (if you're familiar enough with using Photoshop.)
    \r\n\r\nSorry, but our ideas cannot be your ideas. You'll have to come up with
    that on your own."

  body: Andrew is right. Our ideas cannot be your ideas. Do great work - or crash
    & burn. You can learn from either one. Doing a bit of both is good so don't worry
    too much about which one it is.

    assignment clearly, talk to the instructor. Only he/she really knows what is expected.
