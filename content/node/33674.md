  The letter look custom to me but just in case I'm wrong, please don't hesitate to
  correct me by naming that font. Thanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nM."

      find a digital version of the Flair style.\r\nAlso thank you Bald Condensed
      for your replacment proposals.\r\nFYI, an artist asked me to search a font for
      a painting with the words \u201CBLING BLING\u201D. Finally, he has settled for
      a college-like font with 3D massive effect.\r\n\r\nM."
