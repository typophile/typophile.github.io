  go back to hand painted typography in their windows and signs. Here's my question:
  In all of your opinions, will hand painted work like this see a resurgence in the
  near future?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wouldn't mind using my hands in the crafting of
  this art. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2296959124_cceaaff0d4_o_5897.jpg]\r\n\r\nwww.glennsorrentino.com\r\nFollow

  body: "I think it will always have a place, but I don't think it will come back
    and fill all the niches it used to occupy; that would just not be practical.  Take
    window lettering, for example.  Modern vinyl materials aren't just quicker & more
    convenient, but much more durable.  When we go to the trouble of really designing
    something well, we want to use more durable materials.  Me, I'm happy to do things
    the old fashioned ways, but only when appropriate.  If you really want to become
    a \"Letterhead\" be prepared to practice practice practice and practice.  A subscription
    to SignCraft would be a start.\r\n\r\nDo you draw or paint?\r\n\r\nHere's something
    I painted last year:\r\n\r\n[[http://albanysigns.com/pictures/hand_painted_lettering_7.jpg]]"

    away from painting for the most part. I'll mess around with acrylics and hate
    the two week waiting period for oils to dry. \r\n\r\nwww.glennsorrentino.com\r\nfollow

  body: "The above sample is also gilded another art entirely. Dig up Frank Atkinsons
    book on the subject. Lettering enamels dry fairly quickly but do have a curing
    period after. \r\n\r\nAs to your question: too many projects not nearly enough
    sign writers...\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from
