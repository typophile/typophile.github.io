  don't use this style at all, so please excuse my ignorance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OxxfordCLogo_4686.png]

  body: "What is the source of the sample, and how old is it? It seems to be actually
    3-dimensional, as if this image was clipped from a photo of pewter lettering,
    or stamped foil.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like a familiar blackletter design at
    all, so maybe it's custom for this brand.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
