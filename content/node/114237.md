    body: Thanks, Tom. Yes I think it is a similar problem, but I don't understand
      how this font could have gotten formatted for a different language keyboard,
      or how I can fix it.

      body: Regarding the language of the font, sometimes people fonts intended primarily
        for non-latin scripts (it was Telugu in the case I linked to) don't get tested
        as thoroughly for Latin text and bugs get through.  Also it seems like Pages
        is affected by such bugs more than other apps.

          I am not certain how.

    also (that is, Pages is also so sold in addition to the Macintosh) sold by Apple.\r\n\r\nGiven
    the post by Tom Gewecke, posted while I was typing the above, finding your post
    confusing, I remember that TrueType fonts, at least, have slightly different formats
    for use on Windows and Macintosh systems. Saving as a Macintosh font, thus, might
    help matters - although as I remember, the wrong type of font just wouldn't load,
    rather than causing mysterious bugs."
