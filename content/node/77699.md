    but I agree with Trevor: the fourth one is the best of the bunch, being the most
    complete one. "

  body: "Agreed. The fourth (purely formally, as you haven't said anything about it
    conceptually) seems the most refined. it also is the only one containing a bird
    where your & reads clearly.\r\n\r\nThird is a bit too heavy. 5 and 6 lose the
    ampersand too much and just look like abstract flourishes.\r\n\r\nwhat's the context?"

  body: Shouldn't the phoenix be looking up as if it's rising? Looking down like that,
    it looks more like a pigeon or dove.

- body: "Sorry, but I don't think a phoenix works for bankruptcy lawyers. Their clients
    are often huge corporations, and they're primarily looking for really smart professionals
    who display complete trustworthiness. The very last thing they want to encounter
    is a bird of prey!  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't read as a \"phoenix\" at all, but even
    if it did it wouldn't suit the client. Have you discussed the concept with your
    client? In my opinion, a logo for a bankruptcy attorney needs to be: serious,
    strong, sturdy, trustworthy, and express experience and complex education. "

  body: I think Phoenix is primarily associated with rebirth; viewing it as a bird
    of prey is a bit of a stretch. I am not entirely sure what bankruptcy attorneys
    do exactly, but if they help with restructuring and relaunching troubled companies
    (as opposed to shutting them down or dissolving them) then the concept is spot
    on.
  created: '2011-03-02 06:39:13'
- body: "Bankruptcy lawyers do both - dissolve companies completely and/or restructure
    them. Often the restructuring involves breaking the company apart and selling
    the parts to bigger companies. So, while filing for bankruptcy can give a company
    a \"rebirth,\" it's just as likely that it's just a death. \r\n\r\nI still think
    the concept is a stretch. Unless their actual name is Pheonix, it just looks like
    a bird. If pankot hadn't said it was supposed to be a pheonix, I doubt anyone
    would have <strong>ever</strong> guessed it. I also think that Greek mythology
    a bit too \"video game\"  or fantasy for attorneys and their potential clients.
    So, if you added flames to make it actually read \"pheonix,\" then it'll be totally
    inappropriate.\r\n\r\nBut that's just my opinion, of course. "

    think you can avoid the dove-like impression by giving your bird a longer neck
    and some kind of crest on the head"
