body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nDid you know that GlobalType is the world\u2019s largest collection
  of historic typefaces? Almost complete for the 19th and 20th century (til ~ 1970)
  and before? Available online since 2004? Thanks to the acribic work of Mr. Hans
  Reichardt from Linotype who allowed me to publish his typeface stock?\r\n\r\nWe
  de not compare with the commercial typeface collections like myfonts or Fontshop
  that you need for your daily business. We will never sell fonts. GlobalType is meant
  as a resource for research, inspiration and education. We\u2019ve got 91,076 typeface
  names, 2348 type designers and 1047 foundries \u2013 by now. Combined with ~ 4,000
  sample pictures out of the German type specimen \u201CSeemann\u201D, it is possible
  to get an idea of what these typefaces look like, although the sample is mostly
  a simple \u201CHamburg\u201D. For example, you will find 840 different \u201CGaramonds\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe
  collection includes typefaces from Europe, America, Asia and Australia. The basis
  has been the standard references (Seemann: Handbuch der Schriftarten 1926, with
  supplementations through 1939, Jaspert/Berry/Johnson: The Encyclopaedia of Typefaces
  1970, and Mac McGrew, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century 1995).\r\n\r\nFor
  those of you who didn\u2019t know yet about GlobalType, here\u2019s the entrance:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.global-type.org/Searching.743.0.html|Searching
  for typefaces]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.global-type.org/Explanatio.785.0.html|How-to
  for the effective use of the Search menu]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.global-type.org/Handbuch-d.757.0.html|Description

    love\u2014has gone into this project. Your workflow\u2014from my point of view\u2014in
    a most sensible one, and your Onion Model is an interesting concept, also."

  body: Not to be negative but it still needs a little work.  The warning notification
    pop ups are still all in German.  And you have 4000 picture of "Seemann" (hilarious
    by the way), but when I type "Seemann" into the search it doesn't find anything.  All
    in all, great idea though, Bravo!

  body: "@ Ryan: The so-called \"Seemann\" has not been a type desiger, that's the
    reason why you don't find a person of this name in the database. It is a book
    from 1929, containing the typefaces available at that time. Here is a description:\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.global-type.org/Handbuch-d.757.0.html\">The Seemann type specimen</a>\r\n\r\nThe
    error messages will disappear when our minor release will be finished in ~ two
    weeks. Please try another browser instead of Opera* in the meanwhile.\r\n\r\n*
    Opera works well on Linux, but not on Windows."
