  in programing. All my life I have enjoyed designing letters. I am interested in
  knowing what schools or individuals one could find the best study with in the US.
  I currently reside in Arizona. I would be very interested in being an apprentice.
  I would also be interested in attending a university. \r\n\r\nDesigning type digitally
  or at least translating hand drawn types to digital compositions would seem to be
  an essential part of study. Are there masters degrees in this? I certainly do want
  focus on studio work first and foremost. Is this a common practice? I see many programs
  where a masters in all research into books. Becoming an educator at this point in
  my life does not seem to be a worthwhile goal for me. I want to design. For me,
  design should be the focus of the research. \r\n\r\nIs education like this worthwhile?
  Or is one better off to continue designing their own type and following their own
  initiative? \r\n\r\nI thank you for your contribution to this dialogue."

    a good program should also involve a lot of practical work as well.\r\n\r\nDon't
    look only at Master's program (there is a good one in Reading, UK). You might
    find what you want in a college or extension program. Colleges tend to be more
    hands on, and ignore the research aspects that universities find so necessary."

    ago. Still on my mind. Please tell me more about extension programs. \r\n\r\nI
    went to a university and art school. My degree is a graphic design degree. Because
    of the times they call it \"Visual Communication.\" "

  body: Does anyone here do apprenticing? Is that a valid affair? I would love to
    do an internship with a type designer if that is a possiblity.
