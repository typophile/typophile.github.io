  presenting me further, but for now my frustration over Fontographer is getting the
  most attention.\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nI can't import EPS-files into Fontographer. When
  I import it says Syntax Error... I've tried the backwards compability in Illustrator
  too. I've exported to EPS 3.0, 8, 9, 10 - and still same Syntax error.\r\n\r\nI
  can't cut & paste Illustrator vectors to Fontographer either...\r\nIt becomes pixel
  out of the vectors and it put's itself on some kind of invisible layer OR nothing
  happens at all. The funny thing is that it HAS worked one time...\r\n\r\nIs there
  some kind of trick I have to pull here to get the vectors from illustrator to Fog?\r\n\r\nHope
  anybody can help me.\r\n\r\nI have Illustrator CS1, Fontographer 4.72, OSX 10.4.5\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance and regards from Sweden."

  body: "\u2026not sure what the deal is with the \"syntax error\". you might want
    to re-install your apps. i'm no IT expert but i've found that sometimes that can
    be the simplest way to solve some of the weirdest issues.\r\n\r\nanyways, about
    importing the glyphs: my system only allows me to import illustrator 3.o files.
    but the first time i did it, i found out that i needed to save my illustrator
    file with both the stroke and fill turned off (in which i could only view the
    glyphs in outline mode) because the glyphs weren't showing up. when i turned the
    fill off, the glyphs imported fine...\r\n\r\nnot sure if this is the same issue,
    but...\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n--------------------\r\nnc"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI just found the sollution for your CS2 problem when trying to
    import eps files created in Illustrator CS2. I can't waith sharing it with the
    world. Its a bit stupid, but it works fine. Fontographer needs level 1 postscripts
    to import, CS2 can't make those. Maybe there are other sollutions, but this one
    could be the one to use when everything else fails.\r\n\r\nYou create your vector
    thingies in CS2. Make your path as simple as it can get (no overlapping and such).
    Copy it and paste in Photoshop as path. Then you export the path in Photoshop
    as ai. This ai file is ideal to import in fontographer. No error messages what
    so ever, not when importing and not when creating the font files.\r\n\r\nI work
    with windows and fontographer 4.1, but i think this will work on a Mac too."

    use a filter in CS Illustrator.\r\nThen I saved from CS Illustrator in OS X to
    Illustrator 8 running in Classic.\r\nThen saved down from Illustrator 8 to an
    earlier eps format before importing into my 1994 Fog.\r\nIt required a lot of
    experimenting with the various Illustrator settings to get it to work."
