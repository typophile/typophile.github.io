  body: I've found that using my intuition works. I know that sounds odd, but if I'm
    not sure of something I just try what I think should be the way it works. I'm
    often happy to find it does. As much as MAC Lovers dislike PCs, how different
    are they once you get inside the application?

  body: "I've been on a mac for about 6 months. I was raised in dos and windows. Here
    are some things I've done to help me adjust:\r\n\r\nIn the system preferences
    > appearance change the scroll arrows to appear at both ends of a scroll bar.\r\n\r\nI'm
    always accidently clicking too far to the left or right of a window and losing
    focus of the application. In photoshop, always hit F to go to full screen mode.
    Also, try to minimize the windows you're not using. \r\n\r\nControl = Alt. It
    hurts at first, like learning a new guitar chord. I still get cramps in my left
    thumb from reaching it all the way under my palm to press that weird open-apple
    key. \r\n\r\nFont Explorer X has helped a lot with font management. Definately
    use it. \r\n\r\nI still don't understand the mac file structure. I keep all my
    work on the desktop in job folders. The finder window is pretty neat though. I
    primarily use the column view, it's the fastest and easiest. Kind of like the
    old 2 column windows explorer but a but more clumsy. \r\n\r\nNow I just wish I
    could figure out how to get rid of these stupid jelly buttons, rounded corners,
    and brushed aluminum. \r\n"

  body: "I've been using Apple for about two years now. The most terrifying thing
    about Mac OS X is that when you copy a folder over an existing one, OS X completely
    replaces the destination folder (removing the old contents) rather than merging
    the contents, which is what Windows does. I still use my PC to access my Mac hard
    drive and do file management there (batch renaming, synchronizing various folders,
    moving stuff around), since it's much faster than using the Finder. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    there is one thing that I still haven't figured out: with one Finder window open
    in a particular folder, how do I easily open a second Finder window in the same
    folder/path? (So I can go to a subfolder from there and conveniently -- as much
    as it's possible in Finder -- copy/move stuff around)? \r\n\r\nA."

  body: After you go to the source http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/tour/ as Nick
    suggests, just get comfortable with the Mac. And don't worry about asking the
    people you are working with for advice and help. You will find that the dock,
    and the GUI (graphical user interface) is much friendlier than the PC and, in
    general, the Mac is much easier to use. But, like everything else in life, you
    can make mistakes. But have fun while you're working.

    key), it will open that folder in a new window while keeping the old one open.
    Also, if you double-click an icon for an app or a folder while holding option,
    it will close the folder you were in and open the app/new folder.

    more than one button: Mac users only had to wait 25 years for this SUPER improvement).\r\n\r\nAlso,
    in OS X, you will find that, occasionally, an operation will fail (destination

    but you will be given no clue by your Mac as to WHY the operation failed."

    apple key), it will open that folder in a new window while keeping the old one
    open. </em>\r\n\r\nHey, I didn't know that. Now that I do, here is one way to
    do the shortcut Adam is looking for:\r\n\r\nWith a Finder window open, double-click
    a folder in it while holding the command key. A new window (the folder) will open.
    Hold down the command key and click on the title of the new window. A pop-up menu
    showing the folder path will appear. Choose the enclosing folder (or volume).
    You now have two windows to the same file path. The only case when this wouldn't
    work is when there are no folders in the window view you want to duplicate. There
    is probably a way to do this with AppleScript in a way that works regardless.\r\n\r\nFYI,
    before OS X, it was not possible to have two windows showing the same path. This
    is a Next carry-over that confused long-time Mac users at first.\r\n\r\nControl-click
    is the same as a right-click--handy if your mouse only has one button.\r\n\r\n"

    The observation was directed at a PC user, who definitely KNOWS the advantage
    of single-handed navigation."
