  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My new job requires that I sometimes use justified type &ndash; usually just a couple of paragraphs of 9/12 or so, in a measure that can vary between 12 and 30 picas (OK, 2 to 5 inches, picas vs. inches can be a whole &lsquo;nother thread :-) ) and I&rsquo;ve avoided justified type in the past so don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working in Quark 4.1. Any tips on the percentages used in the Edit Hyphenation &amp; Justification dialog box will be much appreciated. Ditto comments on how kerning and tracking work with justified type, as well as pros and cons regarding squooshing and / or stretching the type by one or two percentage points.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">H&amp;J is a broad topic, with plenty of room for debate. <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, here is a set of basic settings that I give to the designers I work with as a starting point. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/legacy/messages/30/32190.gif" alt="Standard H&amp;Js"> <BR> <BR>Make sure that in your Document Preferences &gt; Character tab, the box for Standard Em Space is checked. (If you make these setting changes while no document is open, then these will become your default settings.) <BR> <BR>These make for a decent starting point. I'm sure others will have different defaults from which they start. Whatever you do, <b>don't use Quark's defaults</b>. <BR> <BR>The J settings will vary depending upon the line measure, the leading, the typeface, and personal tolerances (or preferences) for tightness vs. looseness. <BR> <BR>For instance, with a longer measure and more leading, I may allow word spacing to be looser Max. And depending upon the fit of the typeface, I may allow character spacing of +1%. Conversely, with a shorter line, I may prefer a tighter Min. space. Also, with fonts that have an excessive word space built in, I may have to change all of the percentages accordingly. <BR> <BR>The H settings may vary depending upon editorial standards and line measure. For instance, in narrower columns, I prefer to set Min Before to 2 and allow Caps to break and unlimited hyphens in a row. These looser parameters will allow Quark more options to try to achieve more even spacing. I then manually override any unacceptable breaks. However, some editors will not allow a 2-letter break before under any circumstances. <BR> <BR>Regarding squooshing/stretching, I say Just Don't Do It. Same with tracking letterspacing. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, I used to be a purist and set Character Spacing to 0/0/0. But I found through some experimenting that I actually couldn't always notice the difference in -1% (after putting it down and picking it up later, that is). So I started allowing it, just to give Quark a little more leeway to find a better line. But it does depend upon the typeface. <BR> <BR>Regarding Cap breaks, it's just a difference in approach. I let the machine try it and I reject it if I don't like it, instead of trying to find places where breaking caps will help. The thing is, I'm usually going over everything anyway, so I let the program take a crack at it first. It depends a lot upon the content. In an Acknowledgement or something with a lot of names, I turn it off because it's a hassle to track them all down. And in medium to long measures, it's usually unnecessary. But in narrow columns, breaking Caps is one of those sacrifices I often consider. <BR> <BR>Nick, I won't ever scale a line. But I will use additional manual tracking on occasion to fix problems &ndash; depends upon the typeface and measure. But I tell designers working under me not to do it, as a rule, until I can teach them by example, and over time, what's acceptable and what's not. <BR> <BR>Before resorting to tracking, though, I will usually try tracking just the word spacing. It's a useful trick, and more like traditional, metal typesetting. In Quark, if you have the TypeTricks XTension loaded, then highlight the line and using the following keyboard commands: <BR> <BR>Shift-command-option-control-[ will reduce word space by 1 unit; <BR>Shift-command-control-[ will reduce word space by 10 units. <BR> <BR>A line will rarely tolerate more than -10 if my H&amp;Js are set well. The same combinations with the right bracket will increase word spacing accordingly. Note that these key combinations are similar to the ones for applying tracking, with the addition of the Control key. <BR> <BR>On my current projects, though, I have the good fortune to have a really good relationship with the editors and can usually get a rewrite (or an okay on *my* rewrite). <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't agree with Erik's guidelines. I do agree that Quark's defaults often yield too tight letter spacing and too loose word spaces. But I think Erik's guidelines overcompensate.  <BR> <BR>I don't think 80% word space in unjustified is always a good idea. It really depends upon the space and fitting of the typeface. For some, maybe; but not as a general rule in my book. <BR> <BR>I would especially *not* combine +2 units tracking with 80% word space. Again depending upon the typeface, the individual words generally start to pull apart and the word space between them starts to close up and approach the size of the intercharacter spacing. You'll get a more even gray texture on the page this way, but I don't think this is necessarily good for the readability. For instance, I think that the text of <i>Stop Stealing Sheep</i> is a bit too loose in this way. (I'm looking at the first edition.) Perhaps he gets away with it in this case because the style of writing is short and bite-sized, but I wouldn't want to read a novel or lengthy essay set like this. <BR> <BR>I agree that with smaller sizes, positive tracking is a good idea, just as it is a good general rule to use tighter tracking in display sizes. But my threshold for opening up the character spacing is usually down around 8 or 9 point, not Erik's 12. Again, it depends upon the typeface. Most reading faces are designed and fitted for use around 12 point. As a general rule for the average graphic designer, I would not recommend varying from the designed fitting until you get down into the smaller extremes. <BR> <BR>As far as that unlimited hyphen thing goes &ndash; I have found that even when I allow Quark to use unlimited hyphens, it rarely provides more than three in a row anyway. Sometimes, four hyphens is the only way to achieve acceptable spacing in the paragraph.  <BR> <BR>Again, I let the program have some leeway to find what it thinks is the best solution, knowing that I will take the time to review everything anyway and can reject those that are not necessary or not acceptable.  <BR> <BR>I personally don't think hyphenation is the worst compromise in justified text, but it requires human judgement to determine when a hyphenation is cumbersome and impedes the sense of the text and when it is perfectly natural with the phrasing and cadence.  <BR> <BR>But there's nothing more frustrating than trying to tweak a paragraph by forcing a hyphen and not being able to figure out why it isn't allowing me to adjust it &hellip; until I finally realize that there are already three hyphens and Quark is blindly obeying the three hyphen rule. After all, that's what machines do.  <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm really enjoying this exchange on H&amp;J's, a subject which I've been immersing myself in for the last month or two. I'm about half way through James Felici's <i>The Complete Manual of Typography</i>, and have just started rereading Bringhurst's <i>Elements</i> (which is even better now than 4 years ago). <BR> <BR>Felici suggests (with many examples), that flexing character spacing with care and respect, along with consideration for how much the word spacing is flexing, is fine and even recommended. Whereas Bringhurst seems less open to that idea. My questions are these: are there any typophiles that allow more flex in character spacing than what Bringhurst and Kent suggest? (I'm talking about a max of +/-5%) Also, Kent, are you speaking about book typography, or do you include magazine typography, with its tight columns and fast turnaround? <BR> <BR>I'm aware that flexing only word spaces is more 'purist,' but I rarely rely on purism for anything, and would rather settle for reasonable, functional, and attractive. Felici seems to contradict Bringhurst frequently in respect to technique, particularly since Felici is speaking specifically about digital typesetting, and Bringhurst is covering all typesetting. Also, Felici feels more realistic about the environments that typesetting is generally done in, wherease Bringhurst strikes me as describing typesetting ideals. They seem aimed at the same end results (solid typography), but have varied methodologies and philosophies. <BR> <BR>Like Chris, I was taught next to nothing about H&amp;J's, and my current employer couldn't care less, so I've taken on the responsiblity myself for a while now. I'm trying to figure out what should be discounted at face value, what should be accepted readily, and what should be used with care and judgement. My questions aren't meant as a challenge to anyone's assertions, I just really want to get a solid footing.</div>

Even for a present-day oldstyle like Minion, which one would assume Robert Slimbach designed with kerning in mind   <BR> <BR>The thing is, when you first start to use a face in a project, you can experiment with the vartiables.

		<div class="commentbody">In response to the other recent thread on sentence and word spacing, I got a copy of Dowding's 'The Finer Points of Spacing'. <BR> <BR>I think his views are interesting in the context of this discussion also. He begins the book by railing against excessive word spacing. This was apparently common (in the '40s and '50s) because typesetters were paid by how many 'ens' they set. Thus it paid the typesetter just to end a line quick and dirty and let the machine space it out.  <BR> <BR>Dowding shows an example of this loose and sloppy style, and it makes the case that the line breaks up with excessive spacing. He says you can counteract the problem with more leading, but tighter word spacing is better. He quotes Tschichold as recommending 1/4 em and recommends this. <BR> <BR>Now we could note that Tschichold, supervising book production, had an economic interest in keeping down the number of pages, and hence going for tight spacing. Dowding's book itself is too tightly set in my opinion. It is in 9/12 Times New Roman set to a measure of 23 picas. Bringhurst says that for small type sizes 1/3 em may be better, and from Dowding's book this seems to be so.  <BR> <BR>I think that in the '60s, with the advent of photo type, the 'close but not touching' school went overboard the other direction, of tight spacing, in my opinion. <BR> <BR>Now that we have such experts as Bringhurst, Spiekermann, Felici, and here Kent Lew and Nick Shinn all not agreeing tells me that people still haven't figured out the new technology of flexible word and letter spacing and glyph stretching, and how it relates to an optimal reading experience.  <BR> <BR>I think Spiekermann's refutes his own case by immediately saying that you shouldn't follow his own rule with 'Unit'. Surely other faces respond differently, as others have said. <BR> <BR>Since InDesign is new technology, it would be interesting to hear what Adobe has done in testing out and developing its technology on this issue.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&gt;Also, Kent, are you speaking about book typography, or do you include magazine typography, with its tight columns and fast turnaround? </i> <BR> <BR>My primary frame of reference is book typography, since that is what I am most involved in. But some of the books I work with are two- or three-column formats as well. I think the general principles apply broadly. <BR> <BR>For magazine composition, I will use different settings than for book composition. But I will be using the same principles to evaluate my decisions. I judge my work against high standards, even though I rarely meet them.  <BR> <BR>And yes, I have to make the same compromises as anyone else when confronted with difficult situations or time constraints. Narrow columns will require more compromises than traditional book pages, generally. Not every piece of copy is worthy of the same attention or effort to get it just perfect. Sometimes you have to let less-than-preferable hyphens or somewhat loose lines go. I try to be practical.  <BR> <BR>I think the important thing is that one should know *what* it is you are compromising. <BR> <BR>Periodically, I will review my assumptions. Here is a controlled test I do now and then with a new face:  <BR> <BR>I'll set several lines of sample text unjustified (not greeking, but actual text, something representative of the type of work I'm currently doing) with hard returns at the end of each line.  <BR> <BR>Then I take every third line and apply progressively tighter tracking in -.5 unit increments &ndash; i.e., the first and second lines are set normal character spacing, the third line is -.5 units, the next two lines are normal, the sixth line is -1 unit, etc. (Sometimes, I'll even mix them up more randomly. And sometimes I'll do the same thing with progressively looser tracking, too.) <BR> <BR>Then I set this aside and come back to it later. I try reading the text and note when the words become noticeably tight (or loose). It is difficult to be a reader and at the same time try to pay attention to the reading itself; this is by no means a perfectly objective test. But by this method, I establish my parameters and tolerances.  <BR> <BR>+/- 5% is really excessive &ndash; note that this is equivalent to 10 units in Quark. I find that I cannot abide more than 2 units (1%), and am more comfortable with 1 unit. <BR> <BR>My bottom line is that word spacing is more flexible than character spacing. As a reader, I can tolerate greater variation in word spacing, much more than I can tolerate distorted word shapes through even seemingly modest variations in character spacing. <BR> <BR>I am, perhaps, admittedly old-fashioned in my aesthetic, as Nick points out.  <BR> <BR>I think the important thing is to keep looking and analyzing and learning. Notice good composition; notice bad composition; what works and what doesn't. Consider what makes it so. Develop and refine your own discrimination and judgement.  <BR> <BR>Then you won't so much need Rules. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Kent, Yves, Stephen, Nick, Gerald, Chris A., Daniel, Chris R., Hrant, Eduardo, Thomas, William, Tiffany and James. Thank you all very much for the education, and congrats on making this a handpicked thread. Some questions and comments: <BR> <BR>&quot;Make sure that in your Document Preferences &gt; Character tab, the box for Standard Em Space is checked.&quot; <BR> <BR>Can anyone explain what this does? Why it is a good idea. (I like to know why too.) <BR> <BR>Some books were mentioned that I will be looking for.  Tiffany, I haven't forgotten that I owe you a book review. Soon. <BR> <BR>InDesign? Someday maybe. My use of Quark is and has been dictated by interaction with other Quark users. It is still good to be informed, though, and I am taking note of the comments. <BR> <BR>To help with future projects my plan is to set up a sample document with several repetions of the same two paragraphs in the same type box and then create a variety of H&amp;J styles based on the numbers discussed in this thread. When I have a new project I should then be able to quickly set the type in the desired font and get a quick look at a couple of options.. That's the plan anyway. <BR> <BR>Thanks again. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

Also, knowing the number of characters per em in a font aids in copyfitting &ndash;and for this reason line lengths are also measured in ems.

		<div class="commentbody">Alyce, Nick gave a good explanation of the difference between the standard and Quark default em spaces. But let me summarize: a standard em space is a relative unit equal to the point size; the Quark default em space is variable defined as twice the value of the width of the 0 (zero) in a font. So the standard em space is size-dependent, while the Quark default is size- *and* font-dependent. <BR> <BR>(I believe this default was inherited from some phototypesetting systems and may have some validity when working with tabular matter or extremely condensed fonts. But not as the default, IMO.) <BR> <BR>The reason I recommend checking the Standard Em square is that it makes some things more predictable.  <BR> <BR>Although the word spacing is based on percentages of the spaceband character width in a given font, character spacing is determined in units which are 1/200th of an em space. I believe that Quark calculates this differently based on the preference setting for the value of the em space. (There's a slim chance that I'm wrong and that it uses the point size value regardless of whether the standard em space is checked; but I don't think I am. I'd have to go back and do controlled tests to confirm.) <BR> <BR>Nick, I use the en and em spaces periodically. One example is when I have a run-in C-head. Frequently I will decide to style the head in a bold sans serif, set it without any terminal punctuation, and use an en or em space (depending on the line measure) before the beginning of the paragraph proper.  <BR> <BR>Sometimes I will use an en space following a graphic bullet, when the list is not being set hanging.  <BR> <BR>I will also frequently use an en or em space before an end-of-story dingbat. <BR> <BR>The most important reason I choose to check the standard em space is that I use the Quark flex space as a thin (or hair) space, and the flex space is defined as a percentage of the en space (which in turn is determined by the definition of the em space). I like to define the flex space at 25% (which yields an M/8 space).  <BR> <BR>I then frequently use this flex/thin/hair space to slightly separate em dashes &ndash; a compromise between the two competing camps of closed or open em dashes, and again, a convention that I've derived from traditional setting.  <BR> <BR>I also like to use this flex space to separate the multiply symbol in dimensions, or sometimes in botanical hybrid names (depending upon how the typeface sets and where I'm taking the multiply from).  <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Alyce, your idea for a sample comparison document is not a bad one. But I will say that so much depends upon the quality of your actual text (is it punchy journalism with a lot of short terse words or is it academic text with a lot of long jargon, for instance) and the line measure (narrow column vs. full-page measure) that a standard document may not be adequate. <BR> <BR>A slightly different approach that I might recommend is to create a resource document in which you develop several H&amp;J styles &ndash; for instance, your Standard might be 80% / 100% / 133%, but then you define a Tight at 75% / 100% / 133% and a Tighter at 67% / 90% / 125%, or some such (these are just random examples). <BR> <BR>Then when you start a new project and you're establishing your line length and type size and leading, you can import (&quot;Append,&quot; in Quark lingo) these H&amp;J styles from your resource document and quickly apply them to your actual text.  <BR> <BR>(Once you've made your decisions and the work begins in earnest, you may wish to delete any unused H&amp;J styles to prevent confusion later.) <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

I also have been known to use non-breaking spaces following things like &quot;I&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; in unjustified text in order to keep them from hanging out at the end, but to allow the text to flow if the paragraph gets rewritten (as opposed to what happens with a forced break). Or to keep measurement numbers with their units.  <BR> <BR>But again, this can mystify colleagues who follow after. (Although, it's less problematic, in my opinion, than hard breaks that get bumped because of an AA.) <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a great thread. Good practical information about H&amp;J from Kent Lew and others. <BR>William Berkson said earlier that he thought that Dowding's word-spacing (in Finer points &hellip;)  was too extreme. It certainly looks too tight when you first read the book but after a while it seems just right, at least to me <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>.  <BR>Here is the quote from Tschichold from the Penguin Composition Rules that Berkson mentions: &quot;All text composition should be as closely word-spaced as possible. As a rule the spacing should be about a middle space or the thickness of an 'i' in the type used.&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, the Cmnd+Backslash is a great, easy way to speed up bulleted and numbered lists. <BR> <BR>Hmmm&hellip; Other tips&hellip; A lot of them are covered here, I must say. My biggest time savers are key commands, such as (at a PC now, have to do this from memory) Cmnd+Option+Shift+&lt; or &gt; and Cmnd+Shift+&lt; or &gt; to size type quickly. Can't think of any others off the top of my head. <BR> <BR>For general usability, I change the color of my Quark guides to paler, subtler versions of the garish and distracting defaults. It's surprising how much nicer it is. <BR> <BR>[EDIT] Oh, I just thought of another (which is probably more common): use the enter/ return key on the number keypad to insert the equivalent of a page break, that will kick the next text element to the next column/text box (depending on what the situation is). Shift + numeric keypad return forces it to the next box, overriding any columns, if I'm not mistaken. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>I believe the 'flush zone' is an area that forces the last line in a justified paragraph to justify flush with the right side when it gets inside of a certain zone. I think. I've never used it. That would probably explain why setting it to zero doesn't seem to have much effect.&lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Em &ndash; <BR> <BR>The flush zone is exactly as Chris says. The value you enter for flush zone will determine when the H&amp;J engine will stretch the last line of a justified paragraph. A setting of zero means that it will never force justify the last line. <BR> <BR>Some typographers prefer that if a last line gets close to the full measure, it should go ahead and be set full justified. <BR> <BR>If you want to see this effect, set your flush zone to something fairly large, like 25% of your column width. Then apply to some text. If you have a paragraph with a last line at least 75% of the measure, you'll see that it gets stretched out to full justify. <BR> <BR>A more realistic range for an appropriate flush zone setting is on the order of a few points, if at all. I personally never use it. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>
