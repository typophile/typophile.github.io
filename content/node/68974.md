  right-align (in brochures, websites etc) is unconventional, but not incorrect.\r\nIs
  the situation similar (but reversed) in Hebrew, or is left-align actually incorrect.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
  in a web form, placing the labels to the right of the form fields would be unusual,
  but acceptable. What's the situation in Hebrew?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSteve\r\n"

  body: "Right-align is the norm for RTL scripts such as Hebrew, also Arabic, Syriac,
    etc.\r\n\r\nThis affects all layout, not just line alignment, so yes the norm
    for a form would be for labels on the right. In software, the entire user interface
    is normally flipped for such languages."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your replies.\r\n\r\nYes, I realise right align is
    the norm (as is left align in western latin alphabets), but what I'm trying to
    get at is how much offence or difficulty would be caused by having text left aligned.
    (It's unusual but not totally unacceptable for text to be right aligned in latin
    alphabets).\r\n\r\nThe context is that I've built a website for a client which
    currently works in 12 languages (all European), but they want to add four more
    languages, including Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThe user selects a language and then each
    page loads a language file so that markers in the page are replaced by the translated
    text from the language file.\r\n\r\nAdding a Hebrew language file is no problem,
    but if I then have to go through the entire site adding code to say that if the
    user has selected Hebrew the alignment needs to be reversed, then that's going
    to be a whole lot more work, and I need to reflect that in my quote. I suspect
    that they're going to ask if this step is necessary and I'd like to have some
    informed opinions ready in order to reply to that question.\r\n\r\nThe site is
    mainly functional, but obviously needs to look good too. They are making the effort
    to provide the site in many languages, so they obviously take localisation seriously,
    but I don't know if they're going to want to pay for a full site-wide alignment
    fix for the benefit of a single language - unless they really need to.\r\n\r\nThe
    audience are software company sales staff.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSteve"

    of a single language, but how a business competes successfully in a particular
    market; they should know about the Israeli high-tech/ software industry. That
    said, they need a good design, syntax etc etc. so people will take them seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    occasionally seen for a short piece of text in a display setting to be right-aligned
    in a Latin-based alphabet. It is virtually never seen for continuous text to be
    set in this way, nor is it acceptable. You lose the predictability of line-start
    position, which slows reading and results in more line-skip errors. The same is
    true for left-aligning RTL writing systems."

    English reader continues and learns what the words are in Hebrew. The beginner

    Koren erred big time."

    everywhere, there is no divinely privileged right or left. \r\n\r\nYou've got
    a point about continuing to a translation, but only if sentences end on the inner
    margin, which often they don't. I like Koren's layout of Hebrew on the left page,
    English on the right, as with hanging indents it pulls stuff away from the gutter.
    Also English normally has the first page on the right, and Hebrew the first page
    on the left. Still I don't see any knock-out argument one way or the other.  "

    sentences are better understood by English speaking seeking to better pray in

    Koren siddur arrangement is counter-productive. It should be changed."

  body: If there are already 12 western languages, it would seem foolish to flip the
    entire site's design to accommodate a single RTL. Basic styling should be done
    to at least have the text aligned properly, but I wouldn't move navigation or
    other textual elements to their preferred location on the right.
