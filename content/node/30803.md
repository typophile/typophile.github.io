  body: "I think IBM researchers were able to arrange atoms or molecules into the
    IBM logo a few years back. Wouldn't that be smaller than a photon?\r\n(I seriously
    don't know -- I wouldn't recognize a photon if I saw one.)\r\n\r\nBut I do know
    what a tittle is."

  body: "Photons vibrate at higher amplitudes than atoms typically do, so when measured
    as waves photons are larger, but as particles they're smaller.\r\n\r\n(I'm not
    a physicist, but I might play one on TV if I were an actor on a TV show in which
    I played a physicist, but I'm also not an actor.)"

  body: The image was stored in (a quantum state of) a photon. I guess the picture
    is of the stencil(s) used ... and they were not very small if you look at the
    scale.
