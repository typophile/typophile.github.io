  in the Mac 'character viewer' but when i go to select a glyph to insert such as
  an underline it just says - \"The application you are currently using doesn't support
  glyph variants.\"\r\n\r\nAny work arounds?"

    puts glyph variants on the clipboard in a way that Photoshop will understand them.
    At least, they didn't the last time I looked at the problem."

    my reply, is about <strong>glyphs</strong>, not characters. You can get the characters
    (Unicode) from InDesign to Photoshop, but at least in CS6 glyph variant information
    is still NOT preserved from InDesign to Photoshop (I just tried it again), but
    IS preserved from Illustrator to Photoshop.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? If you
    have an ornament that is encoded as an alternate of the bullet, but has no unique
    Unicode of its own, you can copy-paste it from Illustrator to Photoshop and get
    the desired ornament, but going from InDesign to Photoshop will revert it to a
    plain bullet. Similarly other OpenType-specific formatting."

  body: The PopChar that Charles mentioned above will work only if the font in question
    has had encoding assigned to non unicode glyphs. In most cases you wouldn't know
    that unless you ask the font designer before purchasing it. That's why a lot of
    people find it easier to set type in Illustrator and paste it into Photoshop.
