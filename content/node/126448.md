  available block san serifs that are mono linear, have no curves and have a book
  or medium weight? I am working on a stationary systems design that would need to
  have a legible block sans serif at 7 to 9 pt type ranges.\r\nThank you in advance
  for your recommendations. Regards, Sal Randazzo."
