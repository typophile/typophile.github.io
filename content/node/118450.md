  body: "Thanks very much for the lead to Boutique.\r\nI've poked around the web and
    see the Boutique font on the Milieu Grotesque website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.milieugrotesque.com/typeface-boutique\r\nhttp://www.milieugrotesque.com/assets/specimen/Boutique-MG-Specimen.pdf\r\nDesigned
    by Timo Gaessner, released in 2012.\r\nThis site also sells products:\r\nhttp://www.milieugrotesque.com/products\r\n\r\nAlso
    on Fontdeck:\r\nhttp://fontdeck.com/about/foundries\r\nFontdeck is a web font
    service which enables font foundries and type designers to license their fonts
    for use on websites the world over. We take away all the technical hassle for
    foundries and make the service really easy for web designers to use.\r\n\r\nIn
    effect designers rent fonts from Fontdeck. We host the font files on our own servers
    and web designers link to those files in order to display the fonts on their website.\r\n\r\nFontdeck
    is a curated marketplace, bringing high quality fonts to the widest possible audience.
    We\u2019ve created a level playing field, where independent typeface designers
    could compete easily with large foundries, and set prices themselves.\r\n"
