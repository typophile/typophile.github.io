  body: Looks custom to me or at least customized (/A is a mirrored /U with a crossbar,
    /K done with /K top right part and /R bottom left). Thought the /K could have
    been original though but wasn't able to identify the right Didone. For what it's
    worth, something between [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/austin/austin|Austin]]
    (the closest I've found), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/carousel/|Carousel]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/ambroise-std/|Ambroise]], [[http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Eloquent-Pro-Complete-JBT0001065|Eloquent]],
