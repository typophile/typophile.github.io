body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the need to set start points correctly? And what
  is \"correct\"?\r\n\r\nIf we forget about the bug in FontLab (and hope it\u2019s
  fixed soon) when a tangent (if a startpoint) gets converted into two nodes on the
  same spot) \u2013 what is the real need to use, for instance, the \"Fix Startpoints\"
  macro in AFDK?\r\n\r\nOr use the \"Relocate Startpoints\" option in FontLab (where
  you can choose between four positions)?\r\n\r\nWhat could be the worst that happens
  if I not set the starpoints correctly according to the FDK?\r\n\r\nAny practical
  situations that explains the whole picture?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anxious to know :)"

  body: "If you open up the macro in a text editor you'll find the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n<em>Purpose:
    This script sets the start point for every contour in every\r\nglyph. Useful for
    making it easy to compatibilize several single master\r\nfaces in preparation
    converting them into an MM face.</em>\r\n\r\nSo looks like the main goal of this
    macro was to lay the work for \"Add Master Design\", another AFDKO macro.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the Adobe Type 1 Font Format spec, there's a paragraph that reads:\r\n\r\n<em>Whenever
    possible, use the <strong>closepath</strong> command to draw one\r\nof the straight
    line segments, rather than closing a character\r\nwith a <strong>closepath</strong>
    that results in a zero-length line segment.</em>\r\n\r\nThis essentially means
    that a starting point should preferably be placed <em>after</em> a straight line.\r\n\r\nThe
    placement of the start point(s) can also have some influence on how the glyphs
    render at small sizes. AFAIK, this is related with which set of hints is in effect
    for a portion of the outline(s) at a given time.\r\n\r\nThe image below displays
    the rasterization of similar glyphs representing the letter 'A'. The only difference
    between them is the placement of the starting points (on the internal contour
    \u2013 the counter \u2013 and on the external contour). Observe how the counter
    is not in its optimal position in some of the examples, and/or how the \"legs\"
    of the 'A' are sometimes either too thick or too thin.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/startpt_A_4418.png]"

  body: "BTW, if you look at [[Minion]] you'll find that all contours have at least
    one straight segment \u2014 although it may be just one unit long in round glyphs
    such as the 'O'. This was done in order to avoid [[spiking]], when generating
    font instances from the MM source. (AFAIK, there's no reason to do this if you're
    generating the instances with FontLab)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minion_o_5567.png]"

  body: "I don't know which tool was used to generate instances (during the font production
    phase), before we started using FontLab.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is, back in the
    day when Adobe was still producing and selling MM fonts, that trick had to be
    done, otherwise the rasterizer could create spikes in some glyphs, for instances
    created on-the-fly by the user \u2014 not by the font developer.\r\n\r\nNowadays
    there's no need for that artifact, unless you're licensing your fonts in MM format

    recently while working on a project. It happened after applying a transformation
    to the outlines. Now imagine something like this happening while you're using

    a paragraph from the Adobe Type 1 Font Format spec about it:\r\n\r\n<em>Make sure
    that any subpath section formed by the closepath\r\ncommand intended to be zero
    length, is zero length. If not, the\r\nclosepath command may cause a \u201Cspike\u201D

  body: "Miguel. \r\nThanks for your image and information. I understand well.\r\nNow
    I'm working on a project that my predecessor type designer had designed. When
    I saw these situation just like \"Minion\", I didn't understand why there were
    two points at same place. Therefore, I've completely deleted the one of two points.
    But my predecessor was right. I'm gonna read \"Adobe Type 1 Font Format spec\"
    again.\r\nAnd \u201CFix Startpoints\u201D macro seems useful. I'll try it.\r\n\r\nRegards."
