body: "Not sure if this is the right section for this, but, here goes!\r\n\r\nThis
  is my resume! I'm still a student in college (hence the tiny \"experience\" section)
  so I'd be using this resume to apply for graphic design internships and entry-level
  summer jobs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Is the body type too light? Is everything
  aligned okay? Are there any obvious mistakes? How does it compare to other resumes
  that you've seen? Did I put too much stuff in there from HIgh School?\r\n\r\nWould
  YOU hire me?\r\n\r\nThanks for your constructive criticism... go easy on me!"

  body: "Cool. Not a designer here, but some teeny tiny things still catch my eye.
    Specifically, the space between the hyphen-bullets and the first letter of entries
    seems to vary some. For example, under the \"James Madison University\" heading
    on the first page, compare the spaces directly preceding the \"Harrison, Virginia\"
    and \"Expected Graduation\" items. Similar inconsistencies elsewhere also. Another
    note: all of the date ranges really ought to use en dashes rather than hyphens.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "Think the body type is indeed too light, and it might look better to make
    your middle initial the same color as the other two. Otherwise it kind of jumps
    out a little. You might even make it the same color as the rest of the \"enae\"
    or just scrap it entirely.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it's pretty stylish. \r\n\r\nPossible
    typo: flyying.\r\nConsistency nitpicking: Other skills section has an unpredictable
    mix of Title Case and Sentence case.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is more a matter of personal
    taste... but I find garamond kinda old-looking and played out :) Got a more modern
    face (as long as it's legible)?"

  body: "I am not a designer, just a technical writer. This design does not work for
    me.\r\n\r\nThe everything centered style, particularly on the first page, is difficult
    to decipher. Pushing the dates to the right, to look centered, to me, looks awkward.
    The large indents in the text, to make everything look centered, looks awkward.
    I just don't get it. I would make everything left-aligned, and move the dates
    next to the places, because that's what they go with. (Keep the things that go
    together, together.) Then the columns could be a little thinner.\r\n\r\nThe top
    graphic, a big green piece of wood or tree stump, what is that saying? I don't
    have any idea. There's nothing wrong with white space.\r\n\r\nConsider leaving
    the babysitter listing off. References on request is just assumed for many modern
    resumes. Self Employed is misspelled.\r\n\r\nUnder school involvement, will listing
    your religious affiliation hurt of help you in the design community? Also, I don't
    know what a lot of this groups are: Key, Bet, Interact, American Classical League...\r\n\r\nUnder
    Community Involvement, why are you saying constituent instead of member?\r\n\r\nThere
    are two things noticeably missing here. One is your home website. If you don't
    have one, be sure you have a good explanation why.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that's
    missing is any design experience. And you should be emphasizing this! From this
    resume, I cannot identify one thing that you have designed, professionally or
    in school. Make the top left section \"Freelance design experience\". Amplify
    and expand to explain your design experience, whatever it is. What did you design?
    Maybe listing school projects would be appropriate. Move the first two lines of
    your community involvement section into this new section. Delete the Other section
    if you need more room.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot sell your design capabilities on page
    one, nobody is going to look at page two. Take a good look at everything on both
    pages. Is it selling your design capability? Move all that stuff that does into
    the new Freelance Design Experience section. \r\n\r\nMaybe a two or three line
    Summary at the top would be appropriate, summarizing your good people skills,
    your initiative, design qualifications, and business experience."
