body: "a client of mine uses <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/corporate-s/\">Corporate
  S</a> as his CD-font. i wasnt the designer of his collateral stuff, but i need to
  design a brochure for him. he is a consultant, specialised on start-ups.\r\n\r\nso
  now im looking for a serif font that works well with \xABCorporate S\xBB, mainly
  for text-blocks.\r\n\r\nim probably looking for something warm, with a human (not
  necessarily humanistic) touch.\r\n\r\nanyone knows a good choice? im really a beginner
  when it comes to issues like that.. any help warmly appreciated!\r\n\r\nthierry

    Genre, Pentagraf, something might work. He even has a text Walbaum that might
    be just the thing. '
