  body: "Picture 1 is the weakest, IMHO. \r\n\r\nRegarding the other variations:\r\nI
    don't think that the open bottom on the stroked wordmark works.\r\n\r\nThe \"fi\"
    are begging to be connected.I would connect the top of the \"f\" to the dot in
    the \"i\". You will have to raise the \"i\" and the \"l\" to accommodate for this.
    It is ok to have them all level, being that this is for a wordmark.\r\n\r\nI would
    separate the \"o\" and the \"f\" a little. In doing so, I would elongate the arm
    of the \"f\" to the left a bit. It would be nice to see an interaction between
    the overlap that is similar to the \"r\" and the \"o\". I'm referring to the width
    of the space created by the overlap. Also, be widening the space between the \"o\"
    and the \"f\" you may be able to open up that top counter a little bit. That counter
    will become problematic at smaller sizes. Right now it draws your eyes away from
    the rest of the character interactions.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would separate the \"1\".
    It doesn't read 1 extremely well when connected. When you separate it, I would
    put a base on it. a sort of slab serif, like seen in a monospaced \"1\". You may
    also play with slanted and enlargening the top of the \"1\".\r\n\r\nYou may also
    wish to thicken the stroke, just a tad. That may help give a little more stability
    at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nHildebrant."

    better/cooler/hipper/something.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a way to differentiate
    Pro to make a play on words, that doesn't look to corny?- just a thought...\r\n\r\nI'm
    surprised the pros are silent.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple way of what I was talking
    about. Excuse the rather phallic looking 1.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/profile_6098.gif]\r\n\r\n(Hey,
    whaddaya expect from an amateur?)\r\n"

    on the 'i.'

  body: really? you don't think the "i" reads w/o the dot? i feel like it's stronger
    here without it; the "fil" get a bit busy and top-heavy to me as is.
