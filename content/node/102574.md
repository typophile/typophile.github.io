body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nLooking for some suggestions on a font for a title, and I'm
  particularly looking for a script font. The problem is, the title includes my full
  name, and my last name (Pocock) is, well, not rendering very well on any script
  fonts I have tried so far. The particular trouble comes with the \"ococ\" - it isn't
  that common, and I guess there are not many font designers out there that include
  a specific \"oc\" ligature. Anyone have any good suggestions? I absolutely love
  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/liana/|Liana]], and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/montague-script/|Montague
  Script]] would be good as well, but Liana doesn't seem to have any ligatures including
  o's and Montague makes them look a little too close to a's for my personal taste.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Philip"
