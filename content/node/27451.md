body: "Hey Folks.\r\n\r\nCurious who you Bay Area firms/designers would recommend
  for printing services.  Our ol' standby has switched ownership and their prices
  have gone through the roof!\r\n\r\nLooking for the following recommendations:\r\n\r\n<strong>1-3
  Color Litho/Offset Shops:</strong>\r\nPlaces that are good at doing stationary/simpler
  jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>4 Color Litho Shops:</strong>\r\nGood at catalogues and
  books.\r\n\r\n<strong>Letterpress Shops:</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nMainly looking for
  some quality Litho shops that are budget friendly but quality.  I know where to
  go for the high-end stuff, but we are mainly interested in getting the best bang
  for the buck.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\np.s. I tried to search this but
  for some reason I can't input text into the text field (in safari) ?????\r\n"

    good. I don't know if she's doing much commercial work now though.\r\n\r\nYou
    should email Mark van Bronkhorst .. he probably mostly uses printers out of the
    area but given the amt of print work he does, I'm sure he can give you some suggestions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt
