  body: "Why not use the corporate font?\r\nIt should be suitably understated.\r\nScripts
    are OK for personal expressions of grief, but kitsch and phony for a corporate
    expression of sentiment. After all, corporations aren't concerned with clients'
    feelings, they are legal entities predicated on profit.\r\nNote that you said
    the company sends out the card, not an insurance agent.\r\nIf an agent is involved,
    their handwritten note on an ID-compliant card would make a nice contrast."

  body: "> corporate expression of sentiment\r\n\r\nI think that pinned down the entire
    absurdity. I am totally with you here, Nick. No kitsch, by all means. CI in this
    case must obviously be more than font choice. It's about how these cards are going
    to be delivered, a question of style and decency. The corporate font of an insurance
    company should be appropriate enough.\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n\r\nThe previous posts
    came in while I was writing the above. IMHO Optima is perfect. I am less convinced
    about the pics, in particular the drawing."

  body: Can't speak for the typical bereaved, but I would be a bit dismayed by a close-up
    photo of an erect stamen accompanied by a "warm" script font. These images are
    too in-your-face and lack the necessary discretion. You don't need to make a loud
    graphic statement.

    too assertive. Adobe Caslon''s italic might work well for you, with swashes used
    discretely. It might be on the right formal/informal line for your purpose. '

  body: When my father died we received a sympathy card from his insurance company,
    and actually it seemed like a nice gesture. We knew, of course, that it was just
    part of their regular routine in those situations, but still it was nicer than
    just getting a check in the mail with no acknowledgement of the sadness of the
    situation.

    choose. Maybe none. Our \"company\" uses [[https://shop.ekhn.de/shop/shop/cat/sonderangebote/pr/klappkarte-trauer.html|this
    one]]. The real thing has less contrast and is not quite so blueish. IMHO it's
    still too much. But we're not an insurance company ;-)\r\n\r\nAs Nick wrote, the
    picture (if any) needs discretion and should not intrude onto the reader. Here
    are some examples of what I have in mind:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ccard4_6438.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ccard3_4228.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ccard1_4632.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ccard2_6084.jpg]"
