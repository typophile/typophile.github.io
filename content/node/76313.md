body: I wonder if someone would be kind enough to walk me through setting up the .fina
  OT feature. The font I'm building, a revival of a 16th-century italic, has a variety
  of word-ending glyphs, and while I'm familiar with the basic OT features (liga,
  calt, c2sc, frac, etc.), I've never set up .fina before. My uncertainty is how to
  set up a substitution based on the end of a word (followed by space/punctuation/etc.).
  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

    that may affect the terminal form, then undo it in fina and don't forget to place
    fina below calt in open type features window."

  body: "Thanks Kristins, that's simple enough.\r\n\r\nIs it simply the feature itself
    (fina) that determines only the final glyph in a word should be subbed?\r\n\r\nWhat
    about punctuation? Is there a way for .fina to work even if the word is followed
    by a comma, period, hyphen, etc.? From the test I just ran, it doesn't seem so.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Based on the sample you attached, it looks like it does not remain final
    before punctuation: your Q in the sample is the short-tailed variety before punctuation.
    I'd like mine to use the final form before punctuation. In the sample below you
    can see that when the .fina sub is followed by a period, the feature shuts off.
    Will I need to build a separate .calt feature including a punctuation class in
    order for this to work?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fina_6193.jpg]"

  body: The short tailed one is the final form, and it remains short tailed before
    a comma or a period. The screen shot is from indesign so I hope the feature works.
    But I still do not consider myself a great programmer, perhaps anybody else knows
    better.

  body: "Jason, \r\n\r\nindeed, in the \"fina\" feature, it is the application that
    is responsible to determine the context where the feature should be applied, not
    the font. (In \"calt\", it is the font.) So the \"fina\" feature will always be
    applied at what the application considers \"the end of the word\". You don't need
    to check for that in your OT code. Note, however, that your \"fina\" code is free
    to make further checks, e.g. try to differentiate whether the final form is being
    applied before a space, a punctuation sign, or at the end of the line. The \"fina\"
    code can check for *additional* context (beyond the mere \"end of word\") but
    should not check for the end-of-word context. \r\n\r\nAlso, note that there is
    a bug in InDesign that prevents the application from differentiating the end of
    a word and the end of a line effectively. I've discussed this here: \r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/74544\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n\r\n"
