    to be used alongside romans to create a hierarchy. \r\n\r\nWhen I think about
    diagonals I often think back to a professor who would often catch lazy students
    using diagonals to try and whip up a dynamic composition. When confronted with
    the question \"Why do the diagonals make this composition dynamic?\" the students
    never had an answer.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time I guess one can always find diagonals
    from a strictly mathematical perspective: in a shape with an odd number of sides
    all sides are at diagonals to all others, none are parallel (At least I think
    it works that way, I\u2019d have to write a program to test it). So within the
    mathematical structure of reality there are always some kinds of diagonals. "

  body: 'An interesting question. I think the concept of the diagonal would be meaningless
    without our instinctive bodily awareness of the vertical and the horizontal as
    defined by gravity. This is very basic. Aziz''s stairs is an excellent example:  They
    lead up (or down) and also cross a ''horizon''-tal distance. In geometry the diagonals
    join the corners of a square or a cube, or of the capital letter N; or can be
    found in the Arabic medial kaf. The formula for a diagonal is y=ax with ''a''
    some constant defining the slope. If a=1 the line is at a 45 degree angle. In
    the case of the lower edge of the eyebrow in hrant''s thumbnail it is 9 pixels
    high and 27 across so a=0.3333 :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hrant_5565.jpg]'

    I thought: \" what roman glyphs are fundamentally diagonal\". eg maybe the \"x\".
    In an italic one part may be at 90 degrees but part of it must be diagonal.\r\n\r\nIf
    we eliminate the italic then I would say the x, X v V y, Y, M, X, w, W, k , K,

    largely consist of diagonal bodies. If drawing a lower case double story a for
    example, or the spine of s, parts of the stroke are diagonal. A font is a big
    pile of pictures, and with some of these pictures diagonals offer a way of getting
    from one side of the picture to the other.\r\n\r\n<em>Well pictures move from

    perpendicular axes which may be real or imaginary otherwise how can you tell what
    is diagonal? You're definitely looking for one or a pair of perpendicular axes
    as a reference.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, diagonal literally means 'across angles'
    or similar. Thus a diagonal could be horizontal or vertical depending on how the
    shape whose angles one is crossing is placed on the page, or in its own space
    relative to the ground (which is 'flat' if it is perpendicular to the gravitational
    pull, so gravity comes into it too... maybe?) Suppose you draw a regular pentagon
    sitting on one of its sides. The line that you draw between the two points below
    the apex would be both 'horizontal' and yet 'diagonal' too.\r\n\r\nMy head hurts.\r\n"

    A bee hive has perfectly regular (meaning all sides are the same length) hexagons,
