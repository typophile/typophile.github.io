  body: "I was lucky to have lunch with Doyald last week, and get a copy of that magazine
    (especially since I've been having to largely forego reading magazines as a whole
    for a while now). It's great to see a person's passion for type increase over
    time, instead of getting worn down. Whenever you can, listen to what he has to
    say, preferably in his own mellifluous voice!\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nToday,
    learn about the Armenian Genocide:\r\nhttp://www.armenian-genocide.org/genocidefaq.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "i've had the honor of briefly meeting Doyald a couple of times myself through
    his involvement with the San Diego AIGA chapter (although, i'm sure he wouldn't
    recognize me!). he's one of the most graciously humble people i've met, and his
    work is just amazing!\r\n\r\nhe gave a presentation for our chapter a while back
    and one of my favorite parts was the 10 pt penciled \"bodoni\" that he uses for
    his sketch numbers and notations!\r\n\r\ntotally inspiring.\r\n"
