  anonymously for a while... not a typographer, alas, just a (currently) underemployed
  architect hit by recess, left with loads of time to learn & experiment about/around
  type, growing and invasive passion. loads of time but loads to learn i must confess...
  so. here comes my newbie question:\r\n\r\ngoogle chrome just launched a massive
  ad campaign in paris (i've seen some recent tweets about that in london too but
  couldn't find images online). the font is kind of faux marker with lots of alternates
  (see e, g, r), the o is really strange, i think it's rather interesting and i'm
  sorry my photos are so gruesome...taken in the subway.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know what
  it is?\r\ndoes everyone know but me??\r\n\r\n\r\nfo:rtune\r\n\r\n"

    like it's got alternates (check out the two 'e's). I'd say it's probably custom,
    perhaps by H&FJ who did their sans as well.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
