body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is driving me a bit nuts. There's a great 3D/layered font
  in the new Jamie Oliver book 'Comfort Food' that isn't listed at the front of the
  book. Its looks pretty damn similar to Industry Inc but I can see the M is slightly
  different. The inline stroke in the book touches the bottom of the letter, in Industry
  Inc it stops short. Amongst other things, its a different font of course.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nthanks,"

    see any earmark that could contradict it: /M with sloppy verticals, /S straight
    oblique transition, low counter /R, /M inline vertex lower position, /K diagonals
    connecting to vertical via horizontal bar...'

  body: "Ah sorry guys, you are right. Most certainly is Player. Based on how much
    the Player 3D stripes is used through this book, it'd have to be part of a typeface
    to make life easier. That, or set all the headline and constantly outline and
    paste in diagonal lines.\r\n\r\nMuch obliged guys!"

    curious about the typeface.\r\n\r\nI've several of Jamie's other cookbooks, so
    thanks for bringing this one--and Superfantastic--to my attention. And thanks,
    Ryuk, for introducing me to yet another interesting type foundry."
