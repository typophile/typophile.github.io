body: We just posted a rather lengthy interview with Jens Gehlhaar, type designer
  and creative director at Brand New School in Los Angeles. The article includes a
  wide survey of Gehlhaar's type designs from the past decade or so, his thoughts
  on typographic education, and the expatriate experience. Check it out at http://www.neojaponisme.com,
  a new online publication from Tokyo.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jens_main_5890.gif]

  body: Wonderful, Ian! I've been a fan of Gelhaar for a long time and his work is
    not very well known. Where are the typeface examples?
