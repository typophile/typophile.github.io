<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>When I showed my monospace at the Typecon typecrit one of the items that was brought up was the punctuation. The suggestion was made that I more fully tune the shapes to the letterforms. I am realizing Now I am starting to reconsider it's design and I am interested in:
- which fonts' punctuation you admire and why
- things you may have noticed or learned about the relationship between the design of letters and of punctuation
- the way in which a font being a monospace impacts the design punctuation - things like the need for a mono's punctuation to fill a little bit more space than normal and the need for it to be a bit heavier than normal as well.

<div class=commentbody>I don't know what your intention for the font is, but as a programmer, who uses monospaced fonts daily, I'll put my two cents in. I feel most monospaced fonts fail bacause of their punctuation. One of the reasons I think Monaco works so well is it's punctuation is clear but not overpowering, it's well balanced with the alphanumeric characters. ProFont's punctuation is too dark, it overpowers the characters, although it does have a large following. I would like the new Microsoft programming font by Luc(us) de Groot except for the double bowl "g" which bothers me. The punctuation marks have a nice balance but I feel they need a bit more height.

<div class=commentbody>I will have to look at Monaco punctuation again.
<cite> ProFont’s punctuation is too dark </cite>
Agreed.
I have some questions if you don't mind:
<cite> the double bowl “g” </cite>
Are you against them in general, or just in mono's? Also, can you imagine one that you could like or not really? Why?
What size do you use your mono at & at what screen rez? What OS? With or without smoothing?
Do you care about print at all?
Carl Crossgrove gave me some great tips today and pointed me at the punctuation in the Adobe Pro sets. Very Useful!
I am still interested in hearing more.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Again, this coming a programmers perspective.
I'm not against the double bowl "g," there are some beautiful double bowled "g"s, but in a font for programming, at least in my opinion, it's a little distracting. Just as in reading a book you want the type to be pleasing, even interesting, but not distracting.
Monaco is a Mac font, it was one of the original set of "city fonts." I usually use it at 9pt (not smoothed), sometimes at 12pt (smoothed).
Printing is not a big concern for me. That said, Consolas looks better in print then Monaco.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Interesting that two programmers posted here. I'm not a programmer by trade, but have hacked away at more than a few manuals, and have to agree that the use of monospace to represent code is an important application. (When you have monospaced code, then the characters line up correctly in columns ... assuming a monospaced editor font ... this allows easier checking for typos ... if the columns aren't correct, you have missed a character earlier in a line.)
For programming it is important that characters don't look the same. One and ell, zero an letter Oh, period and comma, colon and semi colon, all should be distinct from one another at small sizes. The damned code won't run if you switch the characters.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite> at least in my opinion, it’s a little distracting. </cite>
That's very interesting. With the 'g' the tension I feel is between distraction which I agree the double bowl can create, and distinctiveness which the the double bowl has more of. My goal is make a double bowl that retains the former without too much of the the first. I find that reading with double bowl 'g's works better for me but I don't know if it's better in coding or not.
The one thing I have noticed is that programmers feel very strongly about these things. But they don't all agree at all. The one thing I would really like to have - serious survey of preferences doesn't seem to exist. Perhaps I can get slahdot or somebody to make a survey. Maybe we could host it ( we have the ability here) & get publicity for it in the relevant places. I'd better see how they feel at Punchcut first though. If they agree my question would be - who would you ask to publicize the survey? Digg?
Perhaps Microsoft has good data on this already & would be willing to share.

<div class=commentbody>I have made a request to Typophile to let me make a survey now. Perhaps it will work out. :-)
Here are my proposed questions. Feel free to suggest others or to crit these:

<div class=commentbody>Sorry I'm late to the party here.
I'm a programmer, mostly of Objective-C and Ruby. I'm a member of a few other programmer-related forums (mailing lists, actually) and would be happy to post a link to a survey, once you get it up and working.
You might want to add to the survey a question about use of <em>specific</em> punctuation. As you probably know, different languages use different amounts of punctuation. If you're a Perl programmer, your curly-braces, dollar-signs, and at-signs will be very important. A Ruby programmer will have a somewhat different set of important characters, a C programmer different still. LISP programmers will care mostly about their parentheses... ;)
Also, I suggest adding a question inquiring of the programmer's <em>current</em> favorite programming font(s).

Would you be willing to list the ruby glyphs of choice? & C?
