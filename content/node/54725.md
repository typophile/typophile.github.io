  body: The italic "y" is very unique, with the descender out of the left stroke.

  body: that "y" looks like DTL Fleischmann but the serifs on the caps (even the display
    caps) are different. I agree with Stephen..the N & the a look way out.

    one out -- compared to the other Fleischmann's out there -- although I think it's
    not really a problem.\r\n\r\nI will e-mail the publisher / designer about it later
    today if no one can find it here. :)\r\nDoesn't happen often that there is no
    ID on the forum :P"

  body: "This is an odd creature. Many of the letterforms seem like Garamond to me,
    particularly the 'a', but that 'y'seems to be only in Fleischmann. There are four
    other fonts that Yves once wrote were based on Fleischmann: Mercury by Schwartz,
    Farnham by Highsmith, Fenway by Carter, and Eudald by Feliciano. From what I could
    see of them, at least the first three do not have that italic 'y' (I did not have
    an italic sample for both Eudald versions).\r\n\r\nThis seems like a new font
    to me, so I will be curious to hear what you learn from the publisher.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I tried to post on this a few days ago, and I see it never made it (my internet
    connection has been flaky recently). In an odd (probably not) coincidence, Fran\xE7ois
    Rappo has designed fonts for Optimo, and Optimo has a serif family called Stockmar
    that is based on a design of Johann Rodolf Genath, done by Matthieu Cortat. One
    of the italic versions of Stockmar has a y quite like the odd one we have been
    commenting about. I have samples in my [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]]. You can search by designer, as well as font name.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    wasn't a match.

    is interesting. Especially the resemblance in that italic y is nice to see. I
    think Genath is more balanced and refined though.\r\n\r\nLet's hope Genath will
    be available for license someday, it's definitely a typeface I would use."

  body: "Genath is my free, simple rendering of a baroque type from the Genath Foundry
    in Basle, Switzerland. It's based on a 1720 specimen likely showing Johann Wilhelm
    Haas first design in Basle. Haas, Basle, the foundry produced two centuries later
    a better known typeface.\r\n\r\nLike JM Fleischmann, JW Haas (1698-1764) was trained
    in N\xFCrnberg, probably by Johann and Pankraz Lobinger. Both Fleischmann and
    Haas epitomize a consistent typographic style, specific to Northern Europe. Spreading
    from Prague to, some extend, London. Truely \u2018baroque\u2019, slightly condensed,
    highly contrasted, with playful, fancy details. \r\n\r\n(All my informations about
    Genath and Haas come from: Albert Bruckner \u2018Schweizer Stempelschneider und
    Schiftgiesser\u2019 Benno Schwabe, Basle, 1943.)\r\n\r\nGenath is still a private
    font, but following the interest of Gilles Gavillet and David Rust (Optimo, Geneva)
    the designers of the JRP Ringier book collection, I will probably release it in
    a near future.\r\n\r\n-Fran\xE7ois Rappo\r\n"
