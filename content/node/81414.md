body: "Hey!\r\nI'm French, and frequently looking for some characters I can't type
  with my keyboard (like \u0153) so I needed a way to quickly access them. I used
  to use copypastecharacter.com but some of the ones I need are not there and I thought
  it was lacking features.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote [[http://toki-woki.net/p/Unipasta/|Unipasta]]!
  You'll find more [[http://toki-woki.net/blog/p2560-unipasta-a-unicode-browser|details
  here]] but really it's pretty easy to understand. I think and hope this tool can
  be useful to you too!\r\n\r\nAlso, as I'm in the process of [[http://typophile.com/node/80680|creating
  my first typeface]] I think it should help for that.\r\n\r\nDrop feedback/suggestions
  if you have any!"

    \xBB Typography / Composition Forum would be in order ;-)\r\n\r\nBy the way, Unipasta
    seems to offer similar functionality to the Mac OS X built-in Character Palette."

  body: Wow! This is a great tool! I will definitely use Unipasta when developing
    future typefaces, this is much more user friendly than the pdf charts from the
    Unicode consortium. I'd really like Latin extended additional too, by the way
    ...

    Map, for related functionality.\r\n\r\nSupposedly, there's a new \"standard keyboard\"
    which is superior to the U. S. International layout that future versions of Windows
    will support:\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9995]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    will be nice when it becomes available."

    to contain ready-made keyboard layouts for the old ISO 9995-3 <em>and</em> the
    Macintosh keyboard layout for use on Windows computers, so I, at least, found
    it useful."

  body: Thank you! Now it'll be even more fun making huge Unicode fonts. (I'm sometimes
    envious of the ancient type designers who got away with 230 glyphs per font.)

    looking at an installed font's glyph palette.

    to OS X, I've always been irritated by the keyboard layouts.

    old fonts and upgrading them into OpenType behemoths :-)\r\nThat's worse than
    starting from scratch.\r\n"
