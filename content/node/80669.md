  on may 19th 2011 about RogerExcoffon, and it is available for preordering now (35
  euros instead of 45). \r\n\r\nRoger Excoffon: a name that means little to the man
  in the street. And yet\u2026 if this man in the street were born in France between
  1930 and today, he would doubtless have been exposed to one of his creations. A
  talented typeface designer (Mistral, Banco, Choc and Antique Olive all bear his
  signature) and adman (he designed hundreds of posters and logos, such as for Air
  France), Roger Excoffon is likely among those whose splendid work accompanies our
  every step, emphatically inhabiting the collective unconscious. His alphabets were
  whole, alive with uncommon personality and vigor; they were highly prevalent in
  the 1950s and 1960s, gracing many caf\xE9s, hair salons and bakeries, adorned with
  a flavor and connotations that in fact would engender a disinterest in following
  years; willingly obsolescent, profoundly French, esthetically dazzling, they are
  integral to our history and culture.\r\n\r\nThis bilingual French and English monograph
  by David\_Rault\_(graphic designer and journalist, director of the Atelier Perrousseaux
  collection, member of ATypI, and author of\_Guide pratique de choix typographique)
  deals with the type designer as well as the adman, with the man as well as the artist,
  and features: a biography based on an unpublished interview Roger Excoffon gave
  to Fran\xE7ois Richaudeau in 1977; an important iconography (including rare photographs
  by\_Jean Dieuzaide and never before published paintings from private collections);
  and exceptional contributions by Massin, Peter Knapp, Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida,
  Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez, Fran\xE7ois Richaudeau, Yves Perrousseaux and Hrant Papazian.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adverbum.fr/excoffon--_ouvrage-adverbum_4itkob6k386b.html?PHPSESSID=lauknnd9dh6lccrlldodh33q55\r\n"

    is bilingual, it nonetheless seem odd, given that you describe his work as \"profoundly
    French\".\r\n\r\nNo matter, I'll be ordering a copy!\r\n\r\n"

    to do the English translation - it was very challenging, and I worked very hard*
    to deliver a natural tone that would do justice to the fluid original, while not
    leaving any stone unturned in achieving faithfulness. Interestingly, the experience
    was quite similar to designing a text font!\r\n\r\n* Converted to an hourly rate
    it was probably illegal in California.  ;-)\r\n\r\nBTW, \"gentilhomme\" has connotations
    that conflict with the intended meaning.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
