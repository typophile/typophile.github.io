  body: Eben, as a former NYC resident &#40;I&#39;ve since moved on to the outside
    world&#41;, I always found the exhibits at the main New York Public Library to
    be pretty fascinating from a typographic / design standpoint. The current exhibit,
    &#60;a href=&#34;<a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/calendar/exhib/hssl/hsslexhibdesc.cfm?id=351"

    target=&#34;new&#34;&#62;Russia Engages the World, 1453-1825&#60;/a&#62; seems
    promising if you&#39;re interested in the history of printing.

  body: Eben, are you a cyclist by any chance? If so, rent a bike and ride &#40;at
    least a part&#41; of the NYC Greenway. It goes by the rivers around Manhattan.
    I love it, the typography is rich and diverse. I get on the Greenway at Carl Shultz
    park &#40;Gracie Manson&#41; head north to Harlem, cruise by the Cotton Club,
    and the Cloisters, wonderful grafitti on the bridges, and kitchy type on the buildings
    in lower west Manhattan. The only spot on the ride thats depressing is the WTC
    site.  <BR>If you don&#39;t ride, take a stroll to the Empire State Building,
    wonderful art deco work there and that whole area.  <BR>And unrelated to typography,
    visit Central Park

  body: Daniel - the main branch of the library is truly not to be missed for a type
    affecionado - it&#39;s great. The Gutenberg is perfect. <BR> <BR>Personally, I
    could spend a day or two simply riding to every NYC subway station and pixing
    the graphics. The mosaic type is inspiring and thought provoking for me. <BR>
    <BR>If you want historical scripts - The Cloisters inerior displays are a must
    see as well. It has the finest display of text from the early 1200&#39;s to the
    Gutenberg Bible that I know of &#40;I assume the Vatican and Prado can top it
    for non-tourists&#41;.
