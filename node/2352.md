  <BR> <BR>Sorry I couldn&#39;t find a better picture of the new logo, hopefully you
  get the idea &#40;it&#39;s the circle with the EMI cutout&#41;.'

    main web</a> but they are using it on their <a href="http://www.emichrysalis.co.uk/loader.html">other
    labels</a>. I wonder what the thinking is? <BR> <BR>On the aforementioned EMI
    Chrysalis UK website it&#39;s really hard to read the new logo when it&#39;s that
    small, the block letters in full would be easier. <BR> <BR>Jon

    using it on their other labels. I wonder what the thinking is? <BR> <BR>Yeah,
    and on CD&#39;s that are liscenced from EMI UK by other divisions of EMI, it has
    both logos on the back. At first when I saw that I thought they were trying to
    get people used to the new logo before making a complete transition, but after
    searching for the logo online, I realized the contrary. <BR> <BR>I personally
    really like the somple rectangular logo over the circular one, not really sure
    why. <BR> <BR>&#62;On the aforementioned EMI Chrysalis UK website it&#39;s really
    hard to read the new logo when it&#39;s that small, the block letters in full
    would be easier. <BR> <BR>This becomes extremely important on the back of a CD,
    when the logos are no bigger that a 1/4 inch in both directions.'
