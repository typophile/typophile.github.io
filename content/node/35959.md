  body: "Nothing wrong with your sample, Bob. I particularly like the number of items,
    particularly when there might be an item with 0 items at times. I hate it when
    there is a link, and when you get there, you find there is no information. Job
    boards are often like that. \r\n\r\n\"Click for jobs in Toronto.\" You do. \"There
    currently are no jobs in Toronto\"\r\n\r\nBetter not to have the link if there
    is no information to follow through on, but that makes design more tricky."

    to make a list in HTML? Or how a list should be visually presented? What's the
    actual issue you're trying to resolve?"

    my way I passed by <em>Typography 101</em>, which I enjoyed.  <em>Typophiles for

    had a nice list in the portfolio area www.eyebytes.com/port/index.html\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n "

    are many ways of doing that well. the one to choose will depend on the material
    and the consistency/regularity of the material you have to set.  My Suggestion
    Read some Jan Tischold! Look at the work of Spiekermann.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spiekermann\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps"

  body: "Actually now that I think a bit more you are probably going to be best served
    by reading Tufte although looking at the ideas and examples of work from the 1st
    two will still be a good plan. \r\n\r\nI should also note that in Business it
    is quite often the case that a graphic text/design structure ( such as a bulleted
    list ) is forced into service when it is inappropriate and a different model -
    such as text or a list with commas or multiple lists would work better.\r\n\r\nEditing
    or paring down is also a good plan sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe thing is a list with
    40 entries isn't going to mean much to anybody. Brains/Eyes can't take much more
    than 7 -12 before they get bored. \r\n\r\nThe list on Eyebytes is like that. Too
    long. Needs editing.\r\n\r\nOf course sometimes you have to work with what's given
    to you... But don't give up too soon."

  body: "Bob: honestly, I think you could do with some CSS tutorial, the Web is full
    of them and they will give you more information than what I can possibly can in
    a simple forum post. \r\n\r\nAs for <code>font: .7em/1.3em Lucida Grande;</code>
    that\u2019s the shorthand CSS version for font size/leading/face. \r\n\r\n<code>.7em/1.3em</code>
    means type of 0.7em in size with 1.3em of leading between the lines, set in Lucida
    Grande, which is a humanist sans-serif available on Mac OS X machines. You can
    experiment with these values, change the numbers and the measurement types, like
    putting <code>12px/18px</code>, although using <code>px</code> for font sizing
    is generally discouraged because Internet Explorer 6 on Windows users will not
    be able to resize them at will. "
