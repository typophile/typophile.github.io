  sans was originally designed in 1994 during the first year of my graphic design
  degree in order to circumvent the college's tyrannical \"courier only\" rule of
  their pseudo-basel \u2018basic typography\u2019 exercises. by taking the generic
  macintosh system font and cutting off all the serifs, a pleasantly anonymous and
  functional, yet somehow stylish sans serif was created. i received a third for the
  exercise, but was able to refute accusations of rule-breaking with the answer: \"ah,
  but you see: it's courier SANS!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"
