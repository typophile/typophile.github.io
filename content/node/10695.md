body: So, here it is. My first type design ever. Or the prototype, at least. I&#39;m
  aiming for a fluid look, and I need help figuring out where to draw the line between
  professional and gimmicky. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7422.gif"
  alt="mineral hall">  <BR> <BR>The first letters were a&#34; and &#34;b,&#34; so
  most of the other letters stemmed from those forms. I&#39;m not sure about the &#34;f,&#34;
  &#34;l,&#34; and &#34;t.&#34; I like them straight, but would that detach them from
  the rest? I have a similar problem with the &#34;c,&#34; &#34;o,&#34; and &#34;u.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>As for the first &#34;e&#34; and first &#34;s,&#34; does the top-heaviness
  of them bother anyone? I like it, but others have commented on them.  <BR> <BR>Other
  letters I could really use input on are the &#34;k,&#34; &#34;m,&#34;  &#34;w,&#34;
  and pretty much all the capitals. Or if you have any other suggestions... <BR> <BR>Thanks  <BR>

    make the face too scripty. I&#39;ll probably keep the top-heavy &#34;e,&#34; as
    well, but I&#39;ll work on the &#34;s.&#34;  <BR> <BR>As for the &#34;i&#34; and

    them in yet. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>'

  body: 'allright bloom, i&#39;ll work backwards. i actually noticed the missing dots,
    but i&#39;m not sure if i noticed it in a bad way or not. in terms of readability,
    anything you notice detracts from readability, so that&#39;s your call. you might
    try some of the &#34;t&#34; variants within your sentences for comparison. i think
    both the t and l need some degree of hook, wherever it may be. otherwise they
    kind of get lost. the top-heavy e looks fine. it adds a tiny bit of awkwardness
    that is charming, and it compliments the a with the larger bowl nicely. and you&#39;re
    smart in working on the s. i&#39;d say normalize that one a bit. the smaller tail
    on the y is nice. i think the larger w and v are better, with the point hanging
    below the baseline slightly. the middle m is the best. the last one is too pointy
    and busy. the first k has a simple grace that feel more correct with your set.
    try setting your Q&#39;s on the baseline with the tails hanging below. okay i&#39;m
    tired. '

  body: Okay, I&#39;ve been working on the face, and it has evolved, I think, quite
    a bit. But it could still stand to evolve some more. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve increased
    the x-height and changed a lot of letters. I&#39;ve also created an entire character
    set, which is much less  finalized. I&#39;ll probably post it later, a long with
    some text blocks at various sizes. But for now, I&#39;d really like any feedback
    I can get. Maybe one of those &#34;NEW!&#34; icons will draw some attention to
    this thread... <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8951.gif"

  body: The simplicity is nice, but some of the characters are too clever. The M,
    I think, is suffering the most. The W seems a bit narrow. I think the D, the point
    on it, should be at the bottom and not the top. The E at first glance could be
    mistaken for a lowercase t. I really like the curve in the H and the N, almost
    Art Nouveau. Maybe, as this is a display face, you could set it in some words,
    or company names. Somehow show it in use? I also think it would be nice to have
    a little more weight. Or at least offer that. I do like how it looks in the title,
    mineral hall, that weight feels nice. However the other letters look anemic.  <BR>

  body: 'Thank you for the input. I was beginning to think I&#39;d never get any.
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right about the cleverness, and that&#39;s been my trouble
    from the start. The lowercase letters are the only characters I&#39;m almost 100%
    satisfied with. I think I&#39;ve removed most of the cleverness from them &#40;just
    look at my first post&#41;. I just need to spend some more time and thought on
    the other forms. I&#39;m stumped on the M, and the W is a remnant from my first
    version. I&#39;ll try the idea with the D. I&#39;m glad to hear that these forms
    resemble Art Nouveau--the typeface was actually inspired by some doors in that
    style, on my college&#39;s admissions building, <BR> <BR>As for the weight: Right
    now, I&#39;m just trying to figure out the skeletons of the characters. I want
    to get the shapes right first. I have big plans for several &#40;I mean A LOT
    of&#41; different weights and styles. I&#39;m just worried I&#39;ll never have
    the chance to work on them... <BR> <BR>Thanks'
