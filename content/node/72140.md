  in a couple type specimen books from the 40s, and I'm wondering if anybody's made
  a font out of it yet?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hunt_bros_alphabet_5660.jpg]\r\n\r\n-chank"

    and Stencil fonts and didn't see anything particularly close. Someone like Nick
    Curtis (Oldnick), who has done a lot of Deco fonts, may know.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yeah, there's a good idea here, but it doesn't look like the execution was
    so great. So I'm thinking about making a font that looks like this, but is better.
    But wanted to make sure nobody else had already done it. It's a neat type style.\r\n\r\nThe
    book is the Hunt Bros \"Lettering of Today\" from the 40s. But I know this alphabet
    was in at least one other lettering book, too."

    Moderno's "Geometrique" style</a> is headed in a similar direction in some characters
    (note the "M" for instance), but others are clearly different.

    it wasn''t uncommon for lettering chapbooks of the day to "borrow" from other
    similar works: E.C. Matthews did it extensively...'

  body: Okay, well it's turning into a font now. Almost finished actually. Just need
    to come up with a new name for it. Here's a sneak preview http://flic.kr/p/8sZSFd
