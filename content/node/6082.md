  body: I agree. It looks more squared off in the sample posted. Maybe the lower case
    is another font? Some Phont Philistines do such things, like mixing fonts, or
    squooshing them.

  body: The lowercase is <a href="http://www.ourtype.com/" target="_blank"> Fred Smeijers</a>&#39;
    Sansa Bold Italic, slanted and customized. <BR>Maybe the capitals were tampered
    with as well?
