    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/durrow/\">Durrow</a> from
    Scriptorium. But it is most likely <h ref=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/gandalf/\">Gandalf<a/>
    from Elsner & Flake.\r\n\r\n"

  body: There are a bunch of fonts that are quite close, but I think that the G nails
    this as the old (defunct) Casady & Greene font <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm"
    target="_blank">Meath</a>.

  body: "I absolutely agree about the G -- I was just about to make the same observation
    -- and Meath also has the same lowercase as 'Nicholai Bachman' on the cover.\r\n\r\nGood
    one Mike!\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Mike.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of hanging out here and on the MyFonts
    forum, it's become apparent that those C&G fonts were once quite popular for print
    media. They were almost all quite derivative, but with various \"tweaks\" - most
    for the better, in my opinion - that made them unique."

    Lukrezia</a> is of similar origin.

  body: "I'm far from an expert, but, while Lukrezia looks dandy, I would think that
    a designer would balk at using that 'a' in something like a book title. The font's
    'A' is much more readable.\r\n\r\nI'd not seen FF Lukrezia before. Thanks for
    the pointer, Stephen."
