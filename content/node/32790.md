    body copy is set in. They do however mention using Franklin Gothic for the headings.\r\n\r\nlink:

    it has used a version of Caledonia for a long time.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The Pentagram redesign has just recently been put into use. Is your scan
    older than March 2007? I still think your sample looks like Caledonia, and Matthew
    Carter designed a version of Caledonia for TIME in 1993. You can see the sample
    from the Serif Font ID Guide <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_c/caledonia_time_full.gif\">here</a>.

  body: "I have just gone back to look at my TIME magazines, and the recent March
    26th issue was the first with the redesign. The Editors message to the Readers
    describes the fact that the look was new, but did not go into detail about fonts.
    Clearly, your sample is not from the new version of the magazine, because the
    new typeface is noticeably different from the one used previosly. It looks like
    the main text typeface is now Font Bureau's 'Proforma', so Pentagram is using
    an existing type at this point. They say that the design will be evolving, so
    perhaps the font will also change?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
