  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">{The following is the bulk of a post I just made to the TypeDesign <!-- raw HTML omitted -->discussion list. I thought Typophile would be another good place to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bring this up.} <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Over time, and proportionate to the so-called &quot;democratization&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of type design, many of us have come to the sad conclusion that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the conventional model of &quot;pay-then-get&quot; is not in harmony with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reality in the case of fonts: they're too easy to pirate, highly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->undervalued, and most of all there's no real way of trying the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->product before you buy it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a result, some of us have turned to Shareware, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->which in theory should accomodate us very well, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in practice has come to suffer from two major flaws: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. It's too divergent, covering all kinds of schemes. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. It has a stigma of cheapness. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I propose to re-focus the &quot;get-then-pay&quot; model, in order to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->re-align the Shareware gambit. I call it a gambit because it's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->essentially a trade-off between losing some sales to people who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would just buy the font outright (an increasingly rare breed) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->versus gaining sales from the added access and the gifting of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trust to potential customers. This &quot;gifting&quot; is really a very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->important advantage of Shareware, and can only help increase <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sales and reduce piracy, because it puts a much higher price <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on ethics, and removes the threat associated with the conven- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tional model, thus reducing animosity. People are much more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->likely to be nice to you if you're nice to them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, we need a new name: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I came up with &quot;honorware&quot;. It sounds nice, and expensive, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but not exclusionary. And the &quot;honor system&quot; is well-known. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second, we need to define honorware very tightly in terms of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the customer, but very loosely in terms of the seller. This, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->because we want the customer to know the ethical commitment <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clearly, but we don't want to turn away designers: we need <!-- raw HTML omitted -->critical mass to bestow respect upon the name and concept <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of honorware. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Third, we need to make it seem justifiably more pricey than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shareware. This might seem tricky, but I think if we spin <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it right it's really not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, when you try to think through the implementation of honorware, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it's actually pretty difficult to make it work; I was having a lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of trouble getting the three requirements (priciness, convenience, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trust) to harmonize. But through some brainstorming, a &quot;director&quot; of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a major font house came up with the breakthrough concept: payment in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->installments, with the option to cancel. This is a supremely elegant <!-- raw HTML omitted -->way of allowing two key honorware concepts: accomodating the finan- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cial reality of users; allowing users who can't afford $100 but can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->afford $20 to give us the $20, an not even feel very guilty. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here's what I have so far: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The main concept is that the user gets to download a complete <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   working copy of the font, with no requirement whatsoever of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   paying for simply having it. I think even *hinting* that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   font must be de-installed does more harm than good. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. If the user likes it or uses it, he pays in one of 3 ways: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   all at once; over a few weeks; over a few months. If the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   user chooses an installment plan, he is reminded to pay <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   (or cancel - see below) at each period. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. If the customer stops liking/using it, or for any <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   other reason, he can cancel, and stop paying. Period. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Although we shouldn't explicitly disallow people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   from giving the font to somebody else, we should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   try to encourage them to simply refer to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   original download site instead. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. The EULA is up to the foundry, but gentleness is very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   important: ideally, there shouldn't be any explicit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   legal threats, just implicit ethical ones. There's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   no use smiling if you're brandishing a baseball bat. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6. The post-sales support depends on the foundry, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   might vary depending on partial or full payment. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7. Embedding restrictions are up to the foundry, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   but again, it's better to be nice, especially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   since anybody can download the thing anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   You can't steal a gift. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bottom line: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Being ethical is much more compelling than being legal, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and we can use this to increase sales (and make people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->happier as a side benefit). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What now? Basically, to make this really work, enough of us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have to think it's a good idea, and certain people  have to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hear us thinking it's a good idea, good enough to recruit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us to it, on the ground. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a great place to express support for honorware, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or even simply discuss -and maybe refine- it. Fire at will. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You could call it subtle - but it's still significant. The bottom line is that Honorware can bring in more money than Shareware (for the reasons above). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But you could also say that Shareware is mostly &quot;pay-if-you-use-it&quot;, while Honorware is &quot;pay-if-you're-ethical&quot; with the elaboration that ethics is relative; for example, asking a Tanzanian to pay $100 for a font is a lot less reasonable than asking a Belgian, and they know it. Also, Honorware does not make it illegal to not pay, while Shareware often does. And &quot;often&quot; is a key word, because *some* Shareware schemes are indeed effectively Honorware, but like I said the model is so divergent that nobody -least of all the user- has a clear and consistent idea of what to do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So you could call it a &quot;rebirth&quot; of the original model, which is needed because Shareware is in tatters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Almost all other software is available in demo mode for a trial period, so why not fonts?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rant begins here: Quite frankly, I resent the whole idea of having to pay, say $40 for a font that I might use for a total of six characters - and never ever use again, when for the same price I can buy, say a years supply of paper for my printer, or the latest 3D realistic shoot-em-up computer game, or a big spindle of CD-R's, or even a superb set of Rotring pens or any number of other $40 items. You might say that I'm comparing apples and oranges here, but &quot;it's the price, stupid&quot;. Not only that, &quot;it's the lack of copy protection, stupid&quot;. Ever since digital type began there was never - to my knowledge - any built-in copy protection. The &quot;democratization&quot; of graphic design brought about by desktop publishing hard-and-software did not seem to alert type vendors to the possibilty of selling to the average computer user. Prices remain high to this day and it is no wonder that there are so many cheap knock-off fonts and font collections available, not to mention the rampant piracy going on. $1000 or more for a complete font library? Give me a break!  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's a badly broken system, in my opinion. The honorware suggestion: A nice name, but if you actually want to increase sales then you don't complicate the purchasing process. Paying over a few weeks or months is pretty ludicrous if you are talking about many fonts and various vendors.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->End of rant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry I don't have anything positive to say on the subject. I do think the major type vendors should be taking the initiative on pricing and marketing plans though. The system they all seem to have is not worth emulating down at the scale of the individual font designer/vendor.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I think that &quot;honourware&quot; is in fact no different to &quot;shareware&quot;, just a different name. Most shareware fonts say &quot;pay if you use it commercially&quot; and most people don't. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My opinion is that many people will only pay if you &quot;make&quot; them pay. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing has come out of this thread, that is interesting, and has been discussed at a couple of events recently is the concept of licencing to users on a limited basis. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Martin indicates he'd just like six glyphs. That unfortunately won't work very well because it's very difficult to handle fonts with differing numbers of glyphs without giving each such font a unique name - a real nighmare support-wise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, lots of us think that licences should be tailored to an individual's needs: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You want a licence &quot;just for you&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You want a licence for your work group. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You want a licence that gives you embedding and distribution rights within a large organisation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You want a licence for a document you want to make up right now, but it's a one-off and you won't need to font again (so how about if the font expires in a month, or six months, or whatever?). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You need an update for to a font because there are new glyphs and/or hinting/kerning changes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All the above scenarios are a headache, there's no easy way to get updates to people, there's no easy way to have intelligent fonts that &quot;know&quot; who they belong to and there's no easy way for fonts to expire over time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, let's imagine there were answers to all of these: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can buy a font for $5.00, that expires in three months and can only be used by you (hey, like a sheet of Letraset). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can buy a non-expiring version of the same font, &quot;just for you&quot;, for $25.00 - it won't work on anyone else's machine (actually tied to the user, so you buy a new machine, transfer your licence &quot;tags&quot; and it'll still work). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want a five user licence, that only works for five users, that'll be $40.00. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How about a large company, that has a corporate font, the licence makes it so that it only works on the company's own LAN/WAN? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or, because the font is &quot;smart&quot; and knows who owns it, they can go to the foundry site any time and get a replacement or update? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And just maybe, demo fonts that don't print, but that you can try out on screen? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would this be a model that would appeal to those who buy type?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The current font licensing model sucks. (For  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->both foundries and studios). Perhaps the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->current model only works for the huge  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->foundries (Adobe, Bitstream)  who's whole  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->libraries are bought by large agencies,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->studios and schools. But there's got to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a better model for the big foundries as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant's idea, while a twist on an existing idea  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is still interesting but I'd hesitate to offer my  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fonts free to just anybody in hopes that a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fraction of them would pay for it. (Just as I'd  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hesitate to offer them as shareware or  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->freeware). Clive's points are equally  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting but somehow just as difficult to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->imagine in practice for reasons I'll get to.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In general, this problem stems from viewing  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->font licensing the same way we view  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application software licensing. Indeed, it's only  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the US that is unwilling to provide protection  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for fonts UNLESS they're considered software.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe a much better model would be to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->view fonts as a creative asset like photography  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or illustration, where rights are based on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->usage and the rules for payment seem more  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clear. (With stock photography and illustration  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->low res comps are free in exchange for your  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->name and email address. High res comping  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->samples are provided for a tenth of the final  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->price. Sure you could print your job with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->high res comp, but the stock house knows <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exactly who you are and what your project is.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clive's thoughts about different license  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->schemes for different needs is perhaps what  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the industry needs. (And could indeed follow  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the more familiar stock photo/illustration  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->model.) But I think the ones he  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->states are way too 'user' centric (in the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'software' sense) where it ought to be more  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'project' centric. (&quot;The client just ordered  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another round of changes and the font expired  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two days ago.&quot; Or, &quot;My machine just  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fatally crashed, and it's the only one with the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->font license!&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Consider the project, not the number of users.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does anyone every need a single user  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->license? Make it a single &quot;project&quot; license and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you're on to something. When was the last  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->time, in a studio or agency situation, where a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->single designer was the ONLY person to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->touch a project. Very rarely would a designer  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever buy fonts for perosnal use (even  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->freelancers work on projects with other  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->designers.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't keep Frutiger on my hard drive merely  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->because I think it's a fine typeface. I keep  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frutiger on my machine because I need it  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tomorrow for a client project. (And the font  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better not expire because you can count on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me archiving the font right alongside my Quark  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->files for future assurance that whoever needs  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Quark doc will have the fonts too.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now consider the following fictitous&ndash;but more  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->common than we dare admit&ndash;example. (This  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example concludes in a sort of twist on the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'honor' model: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim is setting a comp using Filosofia Unicase  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for a design review with his client. He has no  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->idea if the client will approve Filosofia; he can  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only hope. He only has Filosofia because  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he (illegally) burned it on a CD back in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his college days. (Raise your hand if you've  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever met a college design student without a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CD full of pirated fonts). Now the comp is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ready to print and Doug needs Jim to email  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->him a copy of Filosofia so he can output it on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the color printer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, now the comp is approved and the studio  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->buys the font. Then the client's in-house  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design group buys it. Without illegally copying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Filosofia Unicase, would Jim ever have used it  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in his comp? My hypothesis is that the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fonts getting 'sold' to clients are the ones that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->designers have on hand&ndash;whether legally or  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not. The end-clients are the drivers of retail  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->font purchases. (Like stock photography or  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->illustration.) If I can't get a free or cheap comp  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of your photo into my design, my client will  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never see it and of course they will never buy  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it. (I'm talking stock here, not custom.) What  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->graphic designer do you know says, &quot;Here's  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the comp, but imagine it set in this cool  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typeface from this specimen book.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(This works for the BIG foundries because  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most large design houses and ad agencies  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own their libraries, Bitstream and Adobe  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->especially. These libraries are maintained by  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IT folks who know the legal ramifications of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->being caught with pirated software on their  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->servers.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll finish my rant by mentioning a recent  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conversation with an influencer at a large font  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->house (no, it's not the one you're thinking).  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This person suggested the idea of distributing  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their vast font library for FREE on CD to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reputable and trustworthy agencies. The idea  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is exactly as I've outlined above except it would  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make the above scenario legal. When the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->client approves the face, you (or they) buy the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->font. This makes that obscure font, that you  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would otherwise never buy, available to test on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that client job. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was going to say this was &quot;my two cents,&quot; but   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wrote an entire essay. Perhaps that's what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->happens when I go away for a week. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I realize I'm a bit all over the place, trying to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->answer both Hrant and Clive and trying to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->introduce another sort of  'honor' model to the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thread. I've just had this kicking around in me  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->since the &quot;making a living&quot; and the &quot;knockoffs  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hurt&quot; threads. Plus it's late. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->//joe</div>

The US does have protection for typefaces as &quot;design&quot;, but not via copyright. The US Patent and Trademark Office will register typefaces as design patents, and these can form the basis of legal action. Now, you may be doubtful as to the number and type of fonts that could qualify for such protection, but Adobe has a patent on Adobe Garamond - this was part of the Adobe/Emigre v SSI case, in which the Judge stated that design patent of this type was a valid form intellectual property protection (although made no judgement in the matter as the case was settled on other issues). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are a number of articles at Fontzone that reference the SSI case and patent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I believe a much better model would be to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;view fonts as a creative asset like photography  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;or illustration, where rights are based on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;usage and the rules for payment seem more  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;clear. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tend to think that for fonts this model doesn't quite work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Clive's thoughts about different license  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;schemes for different needs is perhaps what  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;the industry needs.

What's a project, a single page layout, someone's entire ad campaign globally, someone's corporate ID work for the next ten years?

First thing to realise is that you don't have to buy an expiring licence, and some foundries may not even want to go there. The second thing to realise is that the whole model is based around network-centric solutions. You should be able to update your licence, get a copy of a corrupted or lost font, get a list of the fonts, status and licensing of all the fonts you own 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The weak points being your own network connectivity (your problem) and the robustness of the servers/connection of the foundry conecerned. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Or, &quot;My machine just  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;fatally crashed, and it's the only one with the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;font license!&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well that applies with fonts right now. If you don't have a back-up you're screwed, and you're going to have a real hard time trying to get free replacements from any foundry. I would imagine that systems would be in place to allow you access if you can securely identify yourself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Does anyone every need a single user  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;license? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, I do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Make it a single &quot;project&quot; license and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;you're on to something. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then buy a multi-user licence. I can't quote on specifics but an expiring multi-user licence would probably end up cheaper than a permanent single user licence. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If this could be set up and run really efficiently, and was pretty much leak-proof (ie people *had* to pay for font licences), then I don't see why fonts shouldn't be priced in some cases in the sub $2.00 bracket. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the main reasons fonts are priced as they are today is the costs associated with sales, ie people filling in bits of paper and answering the phone. I think the &quot;Making a living&quot; thread touched on this, big foundry sells hundreds of fonts, but designer gets $50.00. It's not because the big foundry stole all the money, but that the money disappeared through the distribution system. You can see the practical effect of this when foundries sell complete libraries, the cost per font plumets to well under a dollar in some cases, because the &quot;people&quot; and distribution costs for selling 3,000 fonts in one hit are pretty much the same as selling one font, thus the bulk of the cost is licencing fees that go back to the designers (in small amounts still). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;When was the last  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;time, in a studio or agency situation, where a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;single designer was the ONLY person to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;touch a project.

I keep  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Frutiger on my machine because I need it  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;tomorrow for a client project. (And the font  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;better not expire because you can count on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;me archiving the font right alongside my Quark  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;files for future assurance that whoever needs  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;the Quark doc will have the fonts too.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There's a trade-off here. Do you buy an expiring licence on the basis that you don't need it past the end of the week, or you might but you'll deal with that later? Or, do you buy a non-expiring licence because you want to make certain that the font is there and ready to run in three years time if you need it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your decision will be based on the discount you're getting for an expiring licence and whether you have the confidence in the licencing/distribution system to believe that you'll be able to get a replacement for the expiring font at some point in the future. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My take on it is that if I can buy a font for $5.00 rather than $30.00, and it expires in a acceptable time frame, then I'm going to buy the $5.00 font. The same way I would have bought one sheet of Letraset or one line of typesetting rather than multiple copies &quot;just in case&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I were going to buy a set of fonts for ongoing use then I'd clearly see the value in a non-expiring licence. But where the future usage is undetermined I think it's appropriate to pay for the use I'm going to make. I may end up paying more for that font over the longer term by buying several expiring licences, but I think again that's probably an acceptable thing to do (you can buy anything in bulk cheaper than one-offs, but that doesn't mean you buy three tonnes of coffee to get a bargain price over the year). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Jim is setting a comp using Filosofia Unicase  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;for a design review with his client. He has no  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;idea if the client will approve Filosofia; he can  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;only hope. He only has Filosofia because  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;he (illegally) burned it on a CD back in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;his college days. (Raise your hand if you've  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;ever met a college design student without a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;CD full of pirated fonts). Now the comp is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;ready to print and Doug needs Jim to email  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;him a copy of Filosofia so he can output it on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;the color printer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the issue is that in many cases the pirated versions never get translated into legitimate licences. Often designers don't have a clue about font licencing at all, and many of their managers aren't in a position to deal with the issue either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;So, now the comp is approved and the studio  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;buys the font. Then the client's in-house  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;design group buys it. &hellip; What  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;graphic designer do you know says, &quot;Here's  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;the comp, but imagine it set in this cool  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;typeface from this specimen book.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, realistically, this used to happen all the time. It's only fairly recently that design concepts would be shown to clients as more or less finished artwork. A bit of hand rendered headline and some squiggly lines for body type were what clients approved - in some enlightened cases they still do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, I understand your point. My counter would be that in a &quot;smart&quot; licencing system foundries could offer limited res or limited functionality versions of fonts as demo versions. That's essentially what you're asking for isn't it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bitstream actually had a library like this years ago, supplied to designers fairly cheaply, but would only print at 300dpi. When it was sent to a bureau they had the high-res versions and it would rip to film ok. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;(&hellip;These libraries are maintained by  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;IT folks who know the legal ramifications of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;being caught with pirated software on their  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;servers.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These servers are run by IT people who may know what a font is or where it came from, but their boss says &quot;$7,000 for fonts, do we need to?&quot;. In the UK the onus is on the management to deal with these issues where they have been informed of the situation by their staff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Besides which, only very large agencies will have dedicated IT people, most 5-20 person businesses will just muck in together to sort problems out as they occur, or contract out maintenance to a third party who won't care about licencing either way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I'll finish my rant by mentioning a recent  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;conversation with an influencer at a large font  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;house (no, it's not the one you're thinking).  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;This person suggested the idea of distributing  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;their vast font library for FREE on CD to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;reputable and trustworthy agencies. The idea  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;is exactly as I've outlined above except it would  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;make the above scenario legal. When the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;client approves the face, you (or they) buy the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;font. This makes that obscure font, that you  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;would otherwise never buy, available to test on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;that client job.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The thing is that *large* agencies will just buy the CD anyway. Designers will just use the fonts they find on the servers or on their colleague's hard disks, there's no way they're going to go through some reporting system recording every time they use a font so that the agency gets a chance to licence it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've even known designers to &quot;cheat&quot; on the photo stock agencies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's another &quot;huge&quot; foundry story. A recent discussion lead an employee of said foundry to explain that they had pretty much no way of tracking the legitimacy of a font licence if they were to examine someone's HD. Because their fonts were distributed in so many different ways by many different agents, bought individually, in bundles and licenced en masse. Such was the problem that there was additionally no realistic way of offering upgraded licences either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's the kind of mess I want to put a stop to. I want designers to know what fonts are licenced to them, explicitly, and for the foundries to be able to verify that, both for their own benefit and as a client service. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Being able to get upgrades and replacements in the middle of the night are real benefits to font users.</div>
