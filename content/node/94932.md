  body: "This may be a stupid question, but why a \"trademarked\" font? In the good
    old US of A, AFIK, a trademark can only be applied to the NAME of the font, not
    the design. The design of the font can be patented with a Design Patent, but too
    many fonts look similar in some way or another to this excellent and FREE design,
    that it is not likely that such a patent would be granted.\r\n\r\nOTOH, the font
    information itself\u2014i.e., the actual code used to generated the font within
    the OS or wherever\u2014is more or less covered by a common-law copyright, which
    is enforceable in a US court of law if a fake can be proven to be an outright
    copy, beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt. Hello, lawyers' fees.\r\n\r\nSo:
    is \"free\" not cheap enough, or does someone need to toss a lot of dough around
    to feel like a big shot? Because, if the latter is the case, whoever wants to
    feel like a big shot can impress the hell out of me, and STILL use the free font.
    If you catch my drift\u2026which, if you are not yet certifiably insane, you might
    not\u2026"

  body: "lol oldnick, \r\n\r\nI must have phrased the question wrong to get such as
    response :), but what I was wanting to know is what fonts are similar to the two
    types. ie frutiger, gill sans, etc, etc etc. \r\n\r\nFor instance I can look at
    Gandhi and see that I could possibly use that for Gill Sans, but for Open Sans
    an and Lato I was not sure what they could possibly be a substitute for."

  body: "Okay, thanks for cluing me in. Frutiger is A-OK in my book, as is Myriad
    and Symbol. Gill-wise, Syntax is pretty okay, too, and\u2014IMHO\u2014somewhat
    under-appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso, thank you for noticing how I can take a small
    bit of unclarity and make a big deal about it.  It is what Civilized People\u2122
    do best\u2026\r\n\r\nBTW, Shakespeare wrote a play about that, but I forget the
    title at the moment.\r\n\r\nWhat is the emoticon for \"seriously disturbed,\"
    anyway?"
