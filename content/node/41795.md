  running Indesign CS2 on my mac and were using Smartconnection to communicate our
  layouts with our clients.\r\nRecently the font Unit is giving us some headache.\r\nWe're
  using linotype fontexplorer X for fontmanagement.\r\nI've been using Unit for this
  specific client in this configuration for quite some time now. This morning when
  opening a file in it's final stage of development Unit regular was reported missing
  while it was active in Fontexplorer.\r\nSo I cleaned out fontexplorer completely
  and removed al trace of the fonts on my local disc. Then I restart the machine and
  copied the fonts from the server and installed the fonts into fontexplorer again.
  This time Unit medium, bold and black didn't show.\r\nDid the thing a few times
  and every time different styles of Unit went missing.\r\n\r\nPlease help Deadline
  is closing in and we need every workstation available to complete this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Steven"

    in another application? Maybe the document you're working on is somehow corrupted.

    won\u2019t clear all of them and the problem may persist.\r\nA utility like Onyx
    or Cocktail may be better in this case. Or do it by hand (instructions can be
    Googled I guess).\r\n\r\nBTW To make sure that the problem lies in this area you
    could try this: define a new user account and log in to that. Test the behaviour
    of ID and the problematic font(s). If everything is ok you could either troubleshoot
    the userlibrary in the original account or migrate everything that you need over
    to the new one and delete the old one.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: This suggestion may require you to clean your Apple caches out first, but
    I generally don't install fonts in any of the system folders on the mac -- instead
    you can put them in the InDesign fonts folder or in the library/application support/adobe/fonts
    folder. This only works if you are working solely with InDesign or Adobe products
