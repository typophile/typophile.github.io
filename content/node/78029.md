  a magazine about textile arts. Subjects vary from felt art to knitting art. I know,
  it sounds corny, but there are some great projects in it. In this issue there's
  an article on Boukje Voet, a Dutch artist who transformes old books into fantastic
  objects by cutting, ripping, folding en pasting them. Perhaps not to everyone's
  taste (especially book purists), but certainly to mine. It's book design taken to
  another dimension.\r\n\r\nCheck out this link: http://boukjevoet.exto.org/\r\n\r\n(Posted

    who annotate theirs or fold over pages, but I can appreciate the art in this.\r\n\r\n<a

    actually looks like a novel of mine I read a thousand times."

    where a book (<em>object trouv\xE9</em>) is treated as a material."
