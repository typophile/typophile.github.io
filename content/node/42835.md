    what you think makes that '1% good' so I don't think we'll by much help to you.

    of that, but all things are possible."

    it\u2019s pretty clear that Carter put a lot of thought into what got in. It\u2019s
    mostly drek-free, and it\u2019s cool to see what people are doing with letterheads
    that never go out in an envelope and stationery systems without business cards."

  body: "@aluminum \r\n\r\nI'm sure you can understand that 'defining good' is an
    impossible task, in any field. Even philosophs can't define good.\r\n\r\nBut in
    graphic design, there are books that are references. For exemple, Grid System
    is a design bible, like The Elements of Typographic Style or Counterpunch. Most
    of us can agree with this.\r\n\r\nSo i'm searching books that have the same universal
    quality and that can be a reference for stationary. I doubt there is one, but
    for sure some must be better than others. So all designers that are interested
    in letterheads etc. must have searched for this and can share there conclusions.\r\n\r\nMe
    as i said, i found nothing really helpfull but the Designer\u2019s Sationery from
    Roger Walton. But really its not as timeless and wellmade as we can hope.\r\n\r\n+
    Something i don't like in letterheads books too, as, to me, it often look very
    american, and for me (european, and french) it really look exotic and unusable
    (the image i posted is a an exemple).\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThanks for your references.\r\n\u2022
    I was wondering about the Carter one, i need to check it in a library.\r\n\u2022
    about LETTERHEADS: One Hundred Years of Great Design, 1850-1950. The cover look
    VERY american to me and well it seems something more historic-centred so it can
    be interesting in this perspective.\r\n\r\nI'm suprprise too that any book seems
    to be interested in elaboring rules and technical requests on this topic. (cause
    in this area it seems there are very important !)"

    reference. But i don't think you can find it brand new.\r\nI'm not sure i would
    recomend it either. Its just not as bad as\u2026\r\n+ its not about designing
    letterhead for big corps or anything, but still interesting (the layout is terrible
    btw)\r\n\r\n"

    Whatever works, seems to work.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, stationery is going the way
    of annual reports..."

    and the accompanying catalog is the best I have ever seen. \r\n\r\nToday, my graphic
    design business is devoted to engraving which is even finer than letterpress for
    beautiful type.  Buddy up with an engraving company (there are few anymore so
    find one now before they all go away.)\r\n\r\nFYI: In America, the trade term
    \"engraving\" refers to any intaglio printing process but most is actually etched,
    not engraved.  You can go to my website for some looks and tips.\r\n\r\n[[http://nancysharoncollinsstationer.com]]"

    that you\u2019re willing and able to dedicate yourself to engraved stationery

    in knowing about engraving, it has been my area of interest since graduate school
    in the late 70s and is now my formal academic area of research.  I teach graphic
    design, graphic design history and typography and use the historic model of engraving
    as the base for almost everything I teach.  So, if anyone wants information of
    it (including monograms, cyphers and etc.,) just ask.\r\n\r\nJames: you are lucky,
    there are still a couple of engraving shops in the D.C. area.  Next time I am
    there I will be giving a mid-day lecture on monograms and engraving at an architectural
    firm.  I will post it on this blog site so you will know."

    it.\r\nThe fine details on illustrations... Metal plates are optimal for fine
    details and don't get busted by pressure.\r\nAs you know today's letterpress goes
    mostly with photopolymer plates. In my case I realized that photopolymer is good,
    if the thinner details are not smaller then 0.3 of a point. When reproducing screens,
    the line screen amount is low, around 50 lpi.\r\nI remember back in the seventies
    the shop I worked for used brass plates for long run jobs, and also for fine detail
    and screened jobs.\r\nI believe that are people out there who recognizes printed
    art when they see it.\r\nLucky You!\r\n"
