David, I don't see what you describe. Are we both using the same things?

FontLab Studio can decompile some binary OpenType Layout tables into the source Adobe FDK for OpenType notation, but this is by no means obvious and does not work for all kinds of lookup types and feature configurations. 

Once Adobe releases FDK for OpenType version 3 (or 2.5, or whatever they choose to call it) that supports all lookup types, we will rewrite the FontLab Studio part so that it is able to "dump" the binary OTL code into the AFDKO notation more fully.

i would guess that effectively, yes, it is for now due to the limitations of FontLab, however i don't think that the features were intentionally designed for this reason. if i'm not mistaken, the most current build of [[AFDKO]] supports more complex GPOS lookup types (things like being able to kern triplets) and the current build of FLab has not been updated to handle these types of things since the new AFDKO came out. (somebody please correct me if this information is incorrect)</div>

Protection against what? Are you trying to start some sort of conspiracy theory?

There's nothing mysterious, custom or secret about Arno Pro's 'kern' feature other than its complexity is proportional to the size of the font's glyph set. FWIW, the AFDKO version we used for building the fonts is the exact same one that is made publicly available, and AFAIK all the fonts that come out of MakeOTF follow the OpenType specification closely.

If there's anything extraordinary to say about Arno Pro's 'kern' feature is that it's big — read huge —, and uses a GPOS Extension lookup type.

But that's not the point. David started this thread saying that he bought Arno Pro Regular, and the font has no kerning when using it with CS2 apps (InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop). Needless to say I'm still waiting to see some evidence of that.</div>

It would be nice. :-)  Mostly it's just the way my brain works.

But you know of course that it's not just me. Some people think for example that the OT format was invented to un-democratize type design. Now, I'm all for demoting democracy, but most of all being a practical person I'm interested in the effects of OT on the ground - and I like it! Sometimes corporations get it right in spite of themselves.  :-)

We might shed some light on this by doing things like comparing Arno's kerning to that of something like Garamond Premier Pro. Is the kerning better and/or are there more characters/glyphs to kern?

So with AFDKO2, you can do things that are "secure" since they cannot be re-imported into current font editors. But this is temporary only.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)

So you need at least to extract the naming table from the Adobe font and then merge it into the resulting file; I do that with TTX. Aside from that I think FontForge does not scrap Adobe fonts (I have bundled i.e. old version, either CS3 or Adobe Type Classics). Anyway, if FontForge has a problem with a table, it emits a warning message. I have always found a way out with TTX; I have never tried  the FontForge feature "Fontfile &gt; Preferences &gt; Open Font &gt; Preserve tables" that might also help for tables FontForge does not know. But, frankly, if I only modified the GPOS table, I take it from the resulting .otf font produced by FontForge and merge it into the original with TTX. That way, everything else is preserved.</div>

On the first try it failed with the same message as Glyphs (GPOS feature 'kern' causes overflow of offset to a subtable), but after adding "UseExtension" to the kerning lookup in the feature file, the font can be built with makeotf. I haven't done any checks if the font is identical to the original, though.

BTW. In Glyphs, you can find a FDK build structure in your home folder in <code>Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Temp/‹font name›</code>. Perhaps you can add the "UseExtension" lookup flag in the 'features' file there and compile with makeotf from there.</div>
