  for things like movies? For example the highly-acclaimed \"There Will Be Blood\"
  uses a typeface that is repeated yet its supposed to look gothic and somewhat grunged?
  Take a look at the example, with the tile, and see the \"l\"'s and the capitol \"B\"'s
  and \"o\"'s are the same, just like when you type them out on your computer. Wouldn\u2019t
  you think the designers would take the time to build variation from repeated letter-to-letter?
  I know most consumers wont notice, but it bugs me to bloody hell why they cant stop
  being lazy and add some variation to make it custom. I see this more and more, and
  worry its the new age of laziness. What are your thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nhttp://media.movieweb.com/galleries/4743/posters/poster4.jpg"

    giggle at the typeface name \"Kraut-type-a-fuck\"\r\n\r\nI agree, for a free font,
    you think they could have at least spent 5 minutes tweaking the title so it wasn't
    so obviously 'computer made' when they were truly going after an organic look.\r\n\r\nFontplayer,
    in the previous thread, pointed out that the typeface was free for personal use
    only. I too am curious as to whether or not a legitimate license was purchased.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sii, I agree, the other type is disturbing as well. Since when is it a good
    idea to mix all those differnt fonts in the way that they have, and having more
    than one Gothic font to clash with each other? Makes my eyes bleed.\r\n\r\nAluminum,
    thanks for the note on the other thread. I figured someone had to bring this up,
    and so I did a Search to make sure, and it didnt come up. That Search function
    here is limited, at best. And yes, they were trying for an orgainic look, yet
    to our eyes, its anything but. I guess what gets me so riled up is that the mood
    of the poster is there, and has SO MUCH potential to make it a real work of art,
    yet they totally fudged it somehow, so it feels so wasted."

  body: My question is why should they care. Most movie audiences don't care about
    type or how its presented. Its about getting out there. they would have the same
    sales if they used any other typeface. The marketing is more important than the
    design, sorry but true.

  body: "\">>why should they care ?\"\r\n\r\nIt depends on who 'they' is and where
    the whole titles role comes into play.\r\n\r\nFilmmaking, is an art, so one would
    hope the 'artists' would have some interest in maintaining integrity throughout
    the entire presentation.\r\n\r\nBut, the 'art' is often handed off to the studio,
    and, yea, all they care is that we buy $14 tickets and $5 sodas.\r\n\r\nBUT...given
    that this was P.T. Anderson one would have hoped/thought that this would have
    been a concern.\r\n\r\nAnd, seriously, Typophile censors naughty words? ;o)"
