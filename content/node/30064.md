  Italic</a> are headed in the right direction of what I'm attempting to do. I will
  at least, potentially, use those. (Should my client like them for his project.)
  I'm wondering if you can't name more along these lines and is there a script which
  is quirky enough that can be used alongside? I'm not interested in fonts like Bickhman,
  Shelley, Keunstler--as beautiful as they are--as they are too stiff for what I'm
  trying to do. It is a 2-disk set of Children's stories, but will be gifted for Christmas
  and my client would like it to follow along the holiday look of things. So, I'm
  going to do something Victorian Modern for him. Or at least I'd like to. \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    yikes! i don't like how the samples of the LTC fonts are stretched on veer's site.
    please don't think poorly of me, they're not really that distorted!"
