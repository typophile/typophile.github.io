  body: Nah, I did a check with my Bitstream version of Compacta Bold, and it&#39;s

  body: THANKS YVES! Compacta was close enough that my customer approved the work.

    out well. <BR> <BR>Thanks again

  body: Glad to have been able to help you out, Jill. I&#39;m still intrigued by the
    true identity of this typeface though. Maybe it&#39;s just a different cut of
    Compacta? Will we ever find out? ;&#41;

    the original font. Its gotta be out there somewhere.
