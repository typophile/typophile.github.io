  body: ' Are the contours supposed to be &#34;choppy&#34;? That&#39;s pretty cool.
    <BR> <BR>Overall, I like the funky wrapping you&#39;ve put on the decidedly classical
    structure. The &#34;a&#34; is very nice, but the &#34;e&#34; is bothering me -
    maybe give a flare to the bar &#40;or a small serif&#41;. I like the sharp serifs
    too - they convey a nice dignity, like in Meridien. One thing that&#39;s strange
    though is that the ascenders look shorter than the descenders. Coupled with the
    fact that the caps are to me a bit large wrt the ascenders &#40;not to mention
    that making ascenders taller is one of the easier mods, at least in Latin&#41;,
    maybe make the ascenders longer? <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Yes, you are right Hrant,  the contours are angled slightly to a soft point.
    Here is a close-up of the &#34;C&#34; for closer inspection. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/820.jpg"

  body: ' very cleaver! i like the old-world-meets-digital-precision feel. i do, however,
    find the &#34;e&#34; &#40;and possibly &#34;p&#34;&#41; distracting. i would also
    like to see the counter of the &#34;a&#34; closed up a bit. <BR> <BR>one more
    thing, the serifs on the &#34;C&#34; look superb at the large size! '

  body: ' High five on the uncial e. I would cut the beak, but it is precisely the
    e that gives it the old-world meets tech feel. It only takes one funked out character
    to give a face a totally distinct feel-- good job on this one. '
