body: "Does anyone know how to set some parameters that restrict a font to specific
  sizes? In my case, I need the character to be no smaller than 12pt and no bigger
  than 72pt. I would like the character to change to another character for sizes smaller
  than 12pt or bigger than 72pt.\r\n\r\nIs this sort of thing possible in FontLab
  5 with the OpenType programming panel?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    actually supports it.

  body: "Also, realistically, such a restriction would be impractical. Let's say you
    set a line of text at 71pt using your font, and then you zoom in the page by 200%.
    What should happen? The declared font size will still be 71pt, but the displayed
    size will be 142pt. Should the font not render? Disappear? Be substituted by another
    font? \r\n\r\nPractically speaking, there are no real measurement units which
    you could use to set these kinds of limits. Imagine a font being used on a website.
    The web page can be rendered onto a tiny smartphone screen and onto a huge screen,
    with different zoom levels, different relations between CSS pixels and point sizes,
    and real pixels. The fact is that fonts, and layouts, these days are *scalable*
    \u2014 completely scalable. Introducing limits to the scalability would be somewhat
    artificial and would essentially not work well in many cases. \r\n\r\nA."

    of fonts to my client is sometimes difficult, but these posts will be helpful
    to me for added explaination...\r\n\r\nThanks Again,\r\nTim"
