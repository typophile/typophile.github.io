body: "I'm looking into designing a font which would be most suitable for reading
  on a projector screen in reverse contrast (white on black). It will be generally
  for large screens (10 - 50 feet wide) and read at a distance. It will usually be
  small blocks of prose, rather than single words or short phrases.\r\n\r\nWhat attributes
  should such a font have? I'm guessing it should have clearly formed counters (to
  make the reverse contrast easier to read) and strong horizontal strokes to prevent
  the eye from skipping lines, but I don't really know. Or are there any existing
  fonts which you know will be suitable, which I can either learn from or use?"

  body: "Verdana and Georgia are designed for screen use and have lower cases -- unlike
    most of the fonts in the reverse tag list above. I don't know if a reverse/negative
    version is available. The Bodoni on the list has a lower case, but it is very
    high contrast and might be difficult to read.\r\nDon"

  body: "The stroke width will appear differently for positive and negative contrast,
    but that doesn\u2019t mean that you would choose a specific design for a certain
    type of contrast.\r\n\r\nAnd regarding the design: It would heavily depend on
    the perceived font size and the resolution of the projector. If the perceived
    font size and the resolution of the monitor are large enough, you might be able
    to go with almost any kind of type design. But if the font size gets too small,
    you need to get low contrast (regarding stroke width changes, x-height, counters,
    serifs \u2026). If the resolution gets too small, you would need to consider screen-specific
    effects, which fonts like the already mentioned Georgia and Verdana master quite
    well. The operating system or app and their render engine also heavily effect
    the outcome when very few pixels are used for each character. "

  body: FF Transit was designed with this aspect in consideration, eg adaptation of
    glyphs to compensate for glare and such. It is a quite modern typeface and may
    not suit your taste (I like it, though).
