  copy typeface is. It looks like a Garamond, but I'm not sure which one. This is
  the body copy used by Zeit Magazin.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n"

  body: It says on opening a pdf that it is Zeit Garamond under properties - but credits
    that to Adobe, so maybe a slightly modified Adobe Garamond would fit.

    under properties. It's not working on my version so I may have to upgrade. Thanks
    for the tip!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
