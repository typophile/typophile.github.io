  HTML, I know just basics. And it\u2019s too hard and killing to code. I have inspiration
  and I\u2019d like to design with pleasure not making boring work. Can you advise
  me any tool or maybe software that can convert my PSD to WordPress theme? Any ideas?
  Waiting for your help."

    You can only know the limits of a tool if you learn the tool itself.\r\n\r\n\"design
    with pleasure not making boring work.\"\r\nWhat made you think design is all pleasurable?\r\n\r\nSorry,
    I'm just not a fan of people wanting to get a quick fix. If you want it done right,
    learn how to use Wordpress, learn HTML/CSS/PHP/Javascript, or hire someone to
    do it.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the only way to get it from a PSD to Wordpress is to
    split up all the components into separate images and then format the website using
    CSS-controlled divs."
