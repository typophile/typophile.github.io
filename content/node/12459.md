    If you want to approximate this all you have to do is trace the characters and
    add the 3D effect.'

  body: BTW I already looked through a pretty substantial number of shadow and 3D
    fonts and came up with nothing. It does ring a bell though, so give us a bit of
    time.

  body: "Good alternative Philippe. Is there any evidence that this sample is not
    simply a set of hand-drawn letters (are there more letters?).\r\n\r\nBTW, Philippe,
    thanks for showing me how to open the URL in a new page. The 'formatting guidelines
    and options' didn't cover this. I liked the previous \"\\newurl{\" better, but
    at least now I know how to do it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
