  movie title card. And, ii the context of a wider search, would anyone know of the
  fonts used in title cards (I guess, that most of these where hand drawn)?\r\n\r\nLike
  in the other cards:\r\n_ http://www.fda.gov/oc/history/slideshow/graphics/132.JPG\r\n\r\nAs

  body: It looks like a slanted version of an old metal font called Packard. I'm not
    sure if there is a digital version. It's a little hard to Google "packard font"--you
    get nothing but stuff about HP fonts.
