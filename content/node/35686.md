  I'm from Fort Wayne, Indiana, where, when I tell anyone about the movie, everyone
  goes \"Why would they make a movie out of a <em>font</em>?\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen
  it? Is it good?\r\n\r\n-Andy"

  body: I atteneded SXSW earlier this year, but missed the sold-out premiere of <em>Helvetica</em>.
    Thankfully I was able to attend a later screening in Chicago with Gary Hustwit
    on hand to add his anecdotes. A DVD should be released soon (possibly October),
    but I'd highly recommend seeing this documentary in a cinema to show your support
    for these types of films.
