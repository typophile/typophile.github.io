    as Kevin Dresser \"was educated in digital font design under the tutelage of Jonathan
    Hoefler\" and Kate Johnson was \"honing her typographic skills\" for a decade,
    this could well be custom and the above mentioned typefaces are pretty nice. "

    and published by Thirstype five years ago. (Kevin pulled the face from the market
    after a couple of months, for reasons which remain very foggy to this day.) I
    suggest contacting Kevin via his website.\r\n\r\nThis subject has come up recently,
    but a search of the site returns no matches."

    \u2014 was released through Thirstype in July of 2003, and unreleased within 6
    months.\r\n\r\nGeneral had an alternate schoolbook form of 'a', accessed via the
    contextual alternates OpenType feature. (In retrospect, not the best choice, but
    at the time one of the only features one could trust.)"
