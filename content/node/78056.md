    I developed the masters for a narrow family, eventually ending up with the design

    I decided to expand it into a multi-width family and developed a wider version\u2014the
    fonts just released. The original narrower version is almost finished, but at
    some point I decided to break the releases up just to make the thought process
    manageable."

    now, and I don't much care about making money with it, but some future version
    will also be available for sale, because some people will buy a product they wouldn't
    accept for free.  What these plans have in common is recognizing that free fonts
    and pay fonts reach different audiences, so you can maximize your exposure by
    offering both.

    See, thousands of people downloaded the font. And nobody bought it, but that's
    because those weird letters with the diagonal crossbars and such were a stupid
    idea, and I should have killed them when I gutted some far more prominent idiosyncracies
    (Lorimer was once a 20-font family that looked like the Merz logo). But I did
    see a nice uptick in overall font sales. Anyway, Lorimer No. 2, minus all that
    weird stuff, should go out to beta testers by the end of the week."

  body: "<cite>So, conclusions?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe original Lorimer design was too
    weird to be useful, so I don\u2019t even sell it anymore. It\u2019s a symptom
    of spending too much time drawing letters alone in an apartment while conversing
    with dogs. If anything I have learned why so many type designers lean towards
    conservative and established styles\u2014the moment one goes off on a tangent
    things can easily spiral out of control into a family of fonts of no practical
    value. So giving it away was a pointless exercise; like giving away screwdriver
    handles with no shafts.\r\n\r\nBut beyond that, I\u2019ve gone back to the belief
    that free fonts are pointless. If I release free fonts nobody has any way of knowing
    that I\u2019m not just another college kid posting his class project to the internet.
    Getting attention with free fonts is no easier than with paid fonts, because just
    like paid fonts, there\u2019s already too much out there. It works well for guys
    like Chank and Larabie and Jos Buivenga because they started doing it when few
    people were and have done it for so long that designers expect good work. Sure
    there are some other people who have done well with free fonts, like Code Pro,
    but I think that has more to do with having the right design for the time than
    the font actually being free.\r\n\r\nI also don\u2019t see any point in contributing
    to the notion that fonts should be free because there\u2019s no sane business
    proposition for doing so. I\u2019m not Trent Reznor. I can\u2019t give a type
    family away to millions of people to promote my worldwide stadium tour and then
    make tens of millions of dollars. And I\u2019m not a free software author. I can\u2019t
    give a font away and then expect people to hire me to flesh it out with four more
    weights in two styles with small caps."

  body: "Maybe the unorthodox shapes should have alternatives, so that more conservative
    designers would consider it. But they shouldn't be ditched for there maybe people
    wanting that exact shape later.\r\nAlso, from my limited experience in selling
    fonts, it seems like apple's strategy of simplifying the buying options leaves
    customers less confused.\r\nI'm inclined to think that people who buy personal
    use will use it for commercial purposes (in good or bad intentions). Having many
    instances of licensing will make them think twice about buying it in first place
    rather than getting it by impulse (I keep thinking of pc vs mac decision process).
    So why not make it simple and maybe more affordable if it makes sense.\r\n\r\nI
    think the pirate bay thing would be great, but your stunt should maybe be pulled
    in twitter or more spreadable market oriented media. Probably tweeting that you
    just found this crazy cool font torrent at TPB. This way you'd found a larger
    audience prone to downloading/retweeting and hopefully buying it).\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'm with you, that piracy may help boost sales eventually, rather than hurt it.
    I think we sometimes get so worried about protecting it that we eventually forget
    to think about ways to market it and how the customers think."

    apple's brand equity was in an all time low and IBM was the main player then.
    Of course by comparing apple to PC I have brought many other aspects to light
    one of them being brand. But when apple did it at the time people started buying
    more Macs compared to macs themselves (aside from other brands).\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    back to fonts, the variables are many. James had a typeface in which he later
    experienced had no commercial value, tried different things to it etc. All in
    all, I'd love to know more about these strategies and how people have failed and
    succeeded with them, and I found James aproach very valid.\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote,
    I really liked Lorimer 2, looks great."

    that sell well.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the original Loriner, the oddities are not
    particularly attractive when viewed individually, and stand out too much from
    the rest of the glyphs.\r\nThe trick is to make them attractive as individual
    glyphs, and make them feel at home amongst the other glyphs. Then they can become
    the memorable \u201Ctrademark\u201D idiosyncracy, like \u201Cg\u201D in Baskerville
