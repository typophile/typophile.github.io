  body: "There has been no digitization that I'm aware of. I think Dorothy Abbe (WAD's
    heir) denied permission during her lifetime. \r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any promotional
    poster for Falcon. The fonts were only published posthumously, released in 1961
    under Jackson Burke's supervision, many years after Dwiggins had passed away.
    WAD did some preparations on a promotional booklet (specimen) in 1943. I've seen
    some of the setups in the C.H. Griffith archive, but I'm not sure it was ever
    published when the fonts were released, and I've never run across the printed
    piece (though I'd love to add it to my collection).\r\n\r\nI have some proofs
    of Falcon, but I'm not inclined to post hi-res images to the Internet. What's
    your specific interest? Feel free to contact me off-line.\r\n\r\nMaybe I can trade
    you for some Quinto do Noval Nacional 2000 vintage . . .  \r\n\r\nJust kidding
    ;-)\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    I didn't see any images of Falcon in the article, however.

  body: "Well, except that Tiffany actually has an example of the first Falcon design,
    the one that was eventually scrapped and never produced. \r\n\r\nTiff -- Do you
    still have that issue of the <em>Dolphin</em> that you outbid me for at a TypeCon
    auction? There's a story (a Poe story, I think) set in Falcon Experimental No.
    249. I think it's unidentified and uncredited.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    Miguel to post it for me.
