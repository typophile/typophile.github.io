  I see it more and more, and every time I do, a part of me dies. In some instances
  its small-time studios who don\u2019t know better so I lay off a bit, but in many
  cases with big-budget studios like New Line Cinema doing this example of \"Pride
  and Glory\" I just don\u2019t get why the desecration?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.worstpreviews.com/images/posters/prideandglory/prideandglory1_large.jpg\r\n\r\n"

    to do than listen to pretentious designers who think it\u2019s a crime to use
    Arial because Arial is just a modified Helvetica while using Helvetica is classic
    because Helvetica even tho Helvetica is just a modified Akzidenz. \r\n\r\nGet
    over it. Arial may not be great, but it isn\u2019t the worst typeface out there,
    no matter how many times Erik Spiekermann and Ellen Lupton say so."

    3% of graphic designers know the history of Arial (at least ES's version as described
    in Helvetica), and of these maybe 4% care. So statistically no one cares. \r\n\r\nIn
    this case I think the poster works (the W-A spacing seems a bit off). I'd rank
    it in the top 5% of student work I've seen recently."

    \r\n\r\nJames, there is a reason they say that. Open your eyes, and you'll understand

    experienced Creative Directors who approve them?"

    really, they\u2019re just being elitist and pretentious. Knowing a little of the
    type industrys dirty laundry doesn\u2019t make anybody special, and people with
    nothing better to do than get snotty about designers who use Arial really need
    to find something better to do."

  body: As we watched the latest Seinfeld movie, Bee, yesterday, it was fun to pick
    out all of the system fonts they used for different bits. In none of the instances
    did I think, "eww, gross", but more, "hey that is fun". I think it is always a
    matter of appropriate, and even then that in itself is subjective.

  body: "James, it just suggests poor craftsmanship (IMHO). There is nothing especially
    elitist or pretentious about not liking Arial. Sure, there could be a good case
    for using it sometimes, but generally that reason is that it's a bundled typeface
    that starts with \"A\".  When I was a welder, I used to get a little snotting
    (in the nicest way of course) about other welders who couldn't weld a straight
    and even bead, or warped the piece they were working on. As a Screen printer I
    got a little snotty about sloppy registration, bad colour matches, improper squeegee
    pressure and so on. As a craftsman myself, I would rather be challenged to do
    a better job than be given a little slack for not trying very hard. \r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: Very good observations Russell. I would also liken it to blowing your nose
    with diamond chain mail--- sure it will work in place of tissue, but it wont feel
    too good when ts done. It's hard to defend Arial and I dont know why anyone would,
    and for the creative gatekeepers to allow it, just really boggles me. Ignorance
    is bliss they say!

    for hinting Arial in the early 90's probably felt the same way when looking at
    the hinting of Apple's TrueType Helvetica? Maybe? I recall early Web-design advice
    to avoid the italics in particular. "

    is a like margarine. No self respecting chef cooks with it even though it's widely

    Helvetica is an evolution of Akzidenz. Arial is a sloppy copy of Helvetica, a
    poor counterfeit that has fooled a generation of PC users."
