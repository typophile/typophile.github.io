  It is important for Arabic fonts that "liga" and other OpenType features are always
  "on" because in most cases the letters have to be connected. In other way, the font
  looks broken. I have read that browsers enable OT features automatically only for
  Western typefaces. For Arabic you have to write extra code in the css file (font-feature-settings:
  "liga" 1, "dlig" 1;). Any ideas?'
