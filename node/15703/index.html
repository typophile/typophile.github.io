<li>4 of these faces are sans serif</li>
<li>6 of these faces were designed during the second

<p>I guess the few suggestions is a sign of an acceptable accuracy on the list so go ahead. Clarendon and Bank Gothic are certainly overused altough they are not faces for setting extended text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually tired of avant garde, it comes with corel draw (which is by far the most used software for vectors and simple layouts here)
and is in the top of the font menu. However nothing makes me feel more sick than seeing Arial everywhere and in everything: two thirds of the people involved in graphics here don&rsquo;t even know of the existence of Helvetica, they would say &ldquo;oh Helvetica, it looks like an Arial rip off&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the other hand I have always been accostumed to the PC GUI and can&rsquo;t even get a program to run in mac (I learned briefly in a job I had but then I forgot).</p>

<p>In those magazine articles you write, do you rely heavily on empiricism?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a research budget, so really all that&rsquo;s objectively available to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that a trend is happening is information on font sales from a few distributors.</p>
<p>The AIGA &ldquo;top 50 books&rdquo; named the typefaces. That&rsquo;s a competition and would tell you more about the judges' taste, perhaps, but interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to do a statistical survey of type use. In Canada one could start with the book Canadian Advertising Rates and Data, which lists audited circulation of publications. Then you&rsquo;d go to a magazine store and check the top 100 and see what their text types were. Same thing for newspapers.</p>
<p>Book Sales: pretty straightforward too. 
Harry Potter and DaVinci Code would give you the &ldquo;most read&rdquo; fonts.
Berkeley Old Style in Harry Potter, innit?
So &ldquo;most read&rdquo; is not necessarily &ldquo;most used font &quot; or &ldquo;most licenses sold&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the internet, it would perhaps be possible to devise a crawler that sought out the most visited sites and checked what fonts they used.</p>
<p>I suspect that the most read faces, measured in characters multiplied by readers, would be internet &ldquo;core&rdquo; fonts. It would be interesting to compare that with newspaper text faces.</p>

<p>I just thought, as did several others, that the question was not phrased quite right, and suggested a tangential topic, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the hard data on font usage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hector, following up on the sentiment you nailed in your most recent post, my answer to the question &ldquo;Which fonts get in your face and p*ss you off?&rdquo; my reply is,</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Bundled fonts.&rdquo;</li>

<p>Rip-offs.</p>
<p>To a lesser extent by far, fonts that have hundreds of weights that are so close together you can&rsquo;t see a difference but you can&rsquo;t buy an assortment with a smaller, more sensible set.
I would much rather see fonts by usage (text, caption, subhead, display) than an endless range of weights.</p>

<p>You’d never use adjacent weights on a page, you’d pick weights that are separated by several intermediates. I remember Luc(de) Groot making this point very eloquently at Fuse 94 when talking about Thesis.</p>
<p>The other use for two closely weighted styles would be when reversing out some text white on black and wanting the visual weight to match the black on white. Example being <A HREF="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=transit&image.x=22&image.y=8">FF Transit</A> &ldquo;Front&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo;</p>
<p>But not being able to pick and choose the fonts you need seems a bit wrong. Got any examples of this all or nothing bundling practice?</p>
<p>Cheers, Si</p>
