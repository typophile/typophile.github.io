  what do you see here? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40220.gif"
  alt="What do you see?"> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s supposed to be a crown, and &#40;this
  might be a stretch&#41; the negative space is a figure hugging/embracing/supporting.  Can
  you see it, or is it too ambiguous? <BR> <BR>Thanks very much for any help!

  body: I can see the apple/crown without any problem, but the negative figure would&#39;ve
    been impossible to see without your explanation.

  body: i saw the crown right away . . . i don&#39;t see the figure that you are referring
    to . . . &#40;although looking for a figure, the purple aspects of the crown remind
    me of a sumo wrestler&#41;

  body: The the circle of negative space is the head, the edges of the crown are outstretched
    arms. <BR> <BR>The problem is the figure has no hands and the base of the crown
    obstructs the figures body. <BR> <BR>I see the crown well. <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: 'the crown is visible, but the apple is also quite strong. i think the stroke
    on top is too &#34;applish&#34; ... and actually what first appeared to me was
    something clerical. i see no kings crown but something different which i cannot
    name exactly. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    looking at a 3D picture. <BR> <BR>

    crown ...  <BR> <BR>If the success of the mark relies on people seeing a person
    embracing something, you should find a new idea. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>S

    <BR>I&#39;m trying to come up with something Crown-like, but with some added significance
    to it.  My hometown of Regina &#40;named in honour of Queen Victoria&#41; recently
    adopted a <a href="http://www.regina.ca">new logo</a> I don&#39;t think does the
    City justice, so here I am trying to come up with something more fitting - something
    that recalls the royal ties, and at the same time more colourful, lively and friendly
    than just using a crown on its own &#40;which was the old logo&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
    another one I came up with: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40273.gif"
    alt="Crown 2"> <BR> <BR>A crown for our historical Queen City-ness and to symbolise
    civic authority; people linked both in celebration and in support, the community
    reaching forward; purple for our Royal past, green for the City&#39;s growing
    and prosperous present, red for our warm and passionate outlook to the future,
    all firmly planted on the golden Prairie.  <BR> <BR>Any thoughts on how to approach
    rendering a crown?  Other Crown-like logos that might lead me somewhere?  Thanks
    again!'

  body: '&#34;But it looks they are saluting the fuhrer.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ha ha. That
    problem might be avoided by straightening out the little &#34;limp wrists&#34;
    on the red and purple figures.  <BR> <BR>This one has that &#34;non-profit&#34;
    look. I liked the style of the first one more, FWIW. That one just didn&#39;t
    get the job done, though. <BR> <BR>maybe if the three figures were one smooth
    shape. you could make the heads one color, the bodies another and the bottom &#34;u&#34;
    shape the third. '
