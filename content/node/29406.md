    body: "floating means i can \"mark\" a thread so that it stays at the top of the
      list for me.\r\n\r\nwhat happens here is ill post something in a thread, and
      wait for a response etc.\r\n\r\nover the course of the next few hrs, other people
      have posted in other threads, pushing thew one i posted in farther and farther
      down the list, making it extreemly hard to find again.\r\n\r\nif it was floating,
      no matter who commented on what and where, whenever i went back to the board,
      it would appear at the top of my list (not everyone's, just mine).\r\n\r\nit
      makes it waaay easier to follow things. "
