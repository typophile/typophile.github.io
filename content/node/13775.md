  for an uncommon script that conveys a sense of tradition as well as progress, that

  body: thanks everyone! i'm submitting a design based on sloop, but i'm going to
    push for the versions i did with empyrean and aquamarine. i don't think a script
    is appropriate for what they want...we'll see what they choose.
