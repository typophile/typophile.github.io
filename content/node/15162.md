body: "Horrible news for metal type aficionados everywhere:\r\n\r\nJim Heagy, proprietor
  of an enormous warehouse stuffed to the rafters with industrial surplus junk (including
  many hundreds - thousands? - of drawers of well-organized metal and wood type, and
  lots of wrapped foundry type and a whole room full of ornaments and cuts) is being
  PERSECUTED by the MAN and forced out of his Hunters' Point Naval Shipyard space.\r\n\r\nThe
  Navy in its infinite wisdom is selling the property off to private developers with
  the blessing of the City of San Francisco and as part of the environmental review
  process must dig up many sewer lines and perform other underground work which requires,
  supposedly, the premises of all rented units  to be empty as of February.\r\n\r\nSo
  - shall we plan an enormous type-buying trip / exploration to HPNS in the coming
  months? Who knows what Jim will do with all of that stuff. He's got matrices, books,
  specimens, lots of supplies and some presses, too."

    haven't taken me there. Let's take a field trip!

  body: "Yeah, shipping will be very, very expensive - especially for a full drawer.
    Foundry type, if it's all wrapped up, would also be expensive, but easier to ship.
    Very heavy.\r\n\r\nI'll make an evite and find out best dates from Jim if you
    all let me know when is best.\r\n\r\nJLT"

    (Halloween wknd) - once Hrant and I and Stephen work out the date, I'll put up
    an announcement here and make an evite or flyer or something.

    yes, with inflated prices, etc., but yeah know, it really did die off, in terms
    of suppliers, quite some long time ago. It's actually a bit more sophisticated
    than an auction junkpile. If you are interested in saving and preserving letterpress,
    search out the holdings of willing fine printers. Yolla Bolly Press is currently
    selling off a significant portion of its holdings. \r\n\r\nGerald\r\n"

  body: "Hi Gerald & others. I am quite familiar with the current holdings at Yolla
    Bolly and the type held by and used at Arion, by Peter Koch and many other Northern
    California printers and book artists. However - and this is not to contradict
    you - Mr. Heagy, while not a printer or typesetter himself, has indeed collected
    the largest collection of metal type I've ever seen anywhere in the world, and
    without intervention it may end up being melted down for Civil War reenactors'
    musket-balls.\r\n\r\nJim's warehouse has for many years been the best place for
    a young printer to find - for a very few dollars - a shop's worth of good type
    in all sizes. The thousands of drawers (and tens of thousands of pounds) of type,
    matrices, borders and rules, spacing material, wooden furniture, quoins and so
    much more) have been instrumental in the formative work of student printers from
    SFSU to Otis to Mills to CCAC and everywhere else in the west.\r\n\r\nI think
    it would surely be a great pity and a shame on us to allow it to disappear, rather
    than be used for what it was meant.\r\n\r\nJLT"
