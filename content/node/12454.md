body: "How far has modular typeface design been explored (in the digital sense)? I
  guess Multiple Master fonts are along those lines, where you can specify weight
  and width, but has this been pushed further?\r\n\r\nIt seems that with digital type,
  this could be explored with some interesting results. In MM, you started with a
  basic syle, right. But could you start with a totally blank slate and build a typeface
  based on given parameters? Beyond weight and width you could specify presence of
  serifs or not, type of serifs, bracketing, stroke axis, stylistic elements (humanistic,
  neoclassical, geometric).\r\n\r\nElements on a particular glyph could be specified,
  and then related elements on other letters would reflect the change. I'm sure some
  kind of optical engine could be written to even out weight and color of the type.\r\n\r\nI
  guess this would start to move into typeface design by a computer, which is a bit
  of heresy. But the implications could be interesting. \r\n\r\nIf there is something
  out there I'd like to learn more.\r\n\r\nand if there isn't, maybe we could do it"

  body: You should check out Metafont and Metafog, two technologies that explore some
    of the possibilities of generative type design (they're pretty technology-driven,
    though, being more or less programming languages that generate high-resolution
    bitmap fonts). There's also FontStudio / FontChameleon, although those are long-dead
    by now. Practically speaking, nobody's really figured out an effective way to
    manage the complexity of algorithmically modifying fonts on the fly, at least
    not in any particularly freeform way. <a href="http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/fontsoftware.html">Luc
    Devroye's font software page</a> has lots of links worth exploring.

  body: "The real tool for this is [[Letterror]]'s [[Superpolator]]. You can have
    an infinite amount of axis there, even axis for just one glyph in a font. Anything
    could be given an axis, including everything you mentioned in your post.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"designer\" would have to generate the instances into a font though before it
    could be used in an application.\r\n\r\nSuperpolator requires a super dose of
    [[Python]] knowledge. But if you want to do anything with type & programming,
    Python is the language to learn. I'm surprised that Luc Devroye hasn't realized
    this yet.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Meta[insert second word here] is so, so dead.
    Or, if it was ever alive, it was never really intertwined with the type or graphic
    design communities, [[Hermann Zapf]] being a notable exception.\r\n\r\nI wish
    that I knew Python. Someday, I will try to start with it.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "superpolator looks pretty interesting. however it seems to interpolate the
    glyphs from existing glyphs to create new ones. Am I misunderstanding how it works?
    I'm thinking of an interface that would start from zero, with no existing typefaces
    whatsoever. \r\n\r\nessentially it would be a multiple master with no masters.
    just multiples ; )\r\n\r\ngranted, this would require extensive collaboration
    between a very talented coder and a very talented type designer to establish the
    parameters and devise a way to make it work.\r\n\r\nI don't know if somethin glike
    that could be used as a tool to design a finished face. it would have to be pretty
    sophisticated. it could maybe be used as a a quick way to start typefaces, like
    making a \u201Cblank\u201D within certain parameters, getting some rough issues
    down. then the designer could go in and do the fine tuning. It doesn't seem like
    a lot of the parameters would be all that hard to specify, though.\r\n\r\ndan,
    why is python the language to learn for type?"
