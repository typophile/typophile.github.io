  body: Heh, It&#39;s from a few &#40;honest, only a few&#41; years ago. It was taken
    at a photo shoot I art directed. The subject of the photo was late, or getting
    his make-up done, and I stood in so the photographer could check the lighting
    and kept the Polaroid. I thought it might make a good pic for Typophile, but when
    I cropped it, it struck me that it looks just like a publicity shot. So I autographed
    it. :-&#41;
