body: "Hello\r\nI'm interested in finding more type designs like what I'm attaching,
  and I don't even know what term to search for. Divided? Stencil? What would you
  call these -- is it a category, where the letterform is segmented like this?\r\nAlso,
  do you know of other designs like these?\r\n(For the record, this is Albers from
  P22 and a Louise Fili logo, handlettered, I assume.)\r\nThanks for any help you
  can offer.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ecco_4189.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/albers_6601.gif]"

  body: "Hey, Rob. I guess it's a bit difficult to come up with one term that encompasses
    this kind of type or lettering. If you go by historical style names, Alber's alphabet
    is a product of the Bauhaus, with Constructivist influences, while Fili's logo
    for the Ecco imprint has an Art Deco feel. But I wouldn't call both of these examples
    Art Deco, nor Constructivist.\r\n\r\nOn MyFonts, P22 Albers is tagged with the
    following keywords: bauhaus, decorative, geometric, lined, poster, primnitive,
    and stencil.\r\n\r\nI can't think of anything more helpful, though! :-/"

    P22 typeface that might fit this category is Richard Kegler's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/bagaglio/\">Bagaglio</a>."

  body: "The Albers font was, IIRC, originally a plastic stencil, so the stencil category
    is quite applicable. You should be able to find more information in books on the
    Bauhaus, I know it\u2019s also in either Meggs of Jubert.\r\n\r\nAs for the Fili
    logo, I agree with Ricardo about it straddling genres, and it\u2019s just one
    of those special cases without a name."
