    hand, and that is almost certainly the case here. '

    guess would be hand drawn as were a many of the TV/movie titles and credits of
    the era. \r\n"

  body: You could start with almost any bold condensed sans--Impact, for example--in
    a vector drawing program like Illustrator. Convert your type to outlines, set
    the fill to white and the stroke to black. Use the direct selection tool to push
    and pull the various letters into the shapes you want. Then offset the path by
    a few points (set the joins to "round") and fill the offset with black to create
    the dark "halo" effect around the letters. Good luck!

  body: 'You might also consider taking a look at the House Industries website (http://www.houseind.com/)
    and check some of their typefaces. One that is similar is Shag Lounge: http://www.houseind.com/fonts/shagcollection/viewfonts.
    It all depends on whether you just want a similar face or are trying to recreate
    the logo. If it''s the latter, I would just trace it in Illustrator. '

  body: "When a _T_ [or any other letter] intermingles with another letter like this,
    it can be called an interlock. Luc Devroye has complied a collection of Interlocking
    typefaces at Myfonts http://luc.devroye.org/myfonts-interlock/ You might find
    something of interest there.\r\nThe Saint is lettering, so you will not find an
    exact match.\r\nDon"
