  body: 'The font is actually called Apple Myriad, but it is unclear exactly what
    is different compared to the Myriad Pro family. Myriad Pro is a multiple masters-enabled
    family, so it is possible that Apple tweaked some aspects of it. It&#39;s hardly
    noticable, anyway. <BR> <BR>The variation used the most is Myriad Pro Semibold.

    it&#41; about Apple&#39;s typography on Wikipedia: <BR> <BR><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography"
