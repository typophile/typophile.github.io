body: "Greetings all. I'm in search of suggestions. I'm working on a slight face-lift
  for <a href=\"http://www.behance.net/danielpagan/frame/124722\" target=\"_blank\">rigamarole</a>,
  an industry specific newsmagazine (although not published weekly). Part of the facelift
  includes finding a nice new body face. \r\n\r\nIn the past we've used <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/trade_gothic_std_complete_vp/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Trade Gothic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Corporate+S&x=0&y=0\"
  target=\"_blank\">Corporate S</a>. Neither satisfy me completely. I've rediscovered
  <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Myriad+Pro&x=0&y=0\" target=\"_blank\">Myriad
  Pro</a> and particularly like the Light weight. I've also plugged in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Frutiger&x=29&y=11\"
  target=\"_blank\">Frutiger</a>, which I do like, quite a lot, but doesn't typeset
  as easily as Myriad Pro.\r\n\r\nI'd like to find an in between (Myriad Pro and Frutiger).
  I'm also open to suggestions that may detour a bit from that criteria. For this
  project/client, it's really about keeping it simple. It's not about a unique face,
  it's about a face that is readable. A reliable workhorse. Any suggestions? I appreciate
  it."

    you mean by \"doesn't typeset as easliy\"? I'm happy to offer some suggestions
    in that same realm though, starting with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Parisine\">Parisine</a>,

    the design to functionality.\r\n\r\nI would move away from sans, and in this case*
    maybe try a slab.\r\nSomething like Caecilia or the 6-weight (but no italic) Silica.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/pmn-caecilia/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=silica\r\n\r\n*

    Maybe I'm looking for an alternate. I should have written alternate. I'll be coupling
    this sans with <a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1712\"
    target=\"_blank\">Adobe Caslon Pro as a serif counterpart.\r\n\r\n\u201C Can you
    explain what you mean by \u201Cdoesn\u2019t typeset as easliy\u201D?\u201D\r\nMyriad
    Pro is more forgiving in a justified column. It sets tighter with less work. When
    I plug in Frutiger, the word spacing isn't as tight i.e. more rivers."
