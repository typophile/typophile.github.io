    I thought of [[http://www.kengarland.co.uk/KGA%20graphic%20design/caps/index.html|Ken
    Garland]], however I doubt it is."

  body: "I wish I had more info on the book - it is an image I have had in my inspiration
    folder forever, not even sure how I came across it originally.  It certainly has
    me stumped, so I thought I would come to the experts.\r\n\r\nIwan Reschniev is
    the closest I have seen - thank you for the direction! I would like to match the
    roundness instead of the blockiness if the original can't be identified.  Any
    thoughts?"
