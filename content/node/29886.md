body: "I notice that a bunch of [[Typowiki]] pages have just been renamed. (To name
  one example, wiki/faq_free has been renamed wiki/faq_free_fonts. For other examples,
  go to the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/FAQs\">Wiki FAQ index</a> -- three
  of the articles in the list seem to have vanished, because they have been renamed.)\r\n\r\nWho
  is making these changes? Did anyone think it through? \r\n\r\nAll of those pages
  are already linked-to from other Wikis, and those links don't work anymore. (They're
  also linked to from outside the Wiki, to be sure.) If all the current Wiki entries
  are now filled with bad links, that reduces the usefulness of the Typowiki.\r\n\r\nDistressingly,
  when you go to the OLD address, you get a page which says that the entry does not
  exist -- and which invites you to create one. Soon we'll have people creating new
  entries for subjects which already have them.\r\n\r\nSo, two possible solutions:
  Is the person who is renaming the pages willing to change the names back? If not,
  can that person create referring pages, so that people will be automatically sent
  to the newly renamed page?\r\n\r\nSkylar"

    could occur.\r\nI don't know if redirects are possible here!?\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n"

    I've just set up a dorky referring link on the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/FAQ_Free\">old
    Faq_free page</a> which takes you to the new (renamed) one. \r\n\r\nNote to other
    users: if you've been maintaining certain Wiki pages, you might want to check
    that they're still where they used to be. If they're not, you might consider setting
    up a manual referring page the way I did.\r\n\r\nSkylar\r\n\r\nP.S. In the two
    hours since I set up the referring link on the old page, that page got 51 hits."

  body: "Okay, now something REALLY weird is going on.\r\n\r\nYesterday, someone took
    the original \"free FAQ\", which was at http://typophile.com/wiki/FAQ_Free, and
    renamed it -- so that the address became http://typophile.com/wiki/FAQ_Free_Fonts.\r\n\r\nThis
    had the effect of making the page \"disappear,\" since all the links to it no
    longer worked.\r\n\r\nToday, that NEW page has also disappeared. Who is doing
    this? What's going on? I've been maintaining that page with a high degree of sensitivity
    and care. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if some of the moderators on this site could
    look into this and join this discussion so it's not just me wondering aloud to
    myself. =)\r\n\r\nSkylar "

  body: 'skylar, sorry if my renaming things is confusing you. what happens is whenever
    someone edits this page, it causes the path to be broken. i''m not sure what i
    can do to fix this. i guess i could just leave the clumsy name of FAQ_free at
    the top, but i thought FAQ: Free Fonts seemed more elegant. maybe together we
    can come up with a solution to this page-naming problem.'

  body: "Paul: Thanks for the explanation. I agree, by the way -- the new page address
    was more elegant. \r\n\r\nBut let's keep in mind that the Wiki pages, when renamed,
    seem to disappear.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the answer is to leave the current
    inelegant addresses alone, and to name future pages more elegantly! =)\r\n\r\nOne
    person's opinion.\r\n\r\nSkylar\r\n\r\nP.S. What about all the other articles
    that seem to have disappeared? Were they also renamed? For example, on the main
    FAQ page, http://typophile.com/wiki/FAQs, two other FAQs (besides the \"free\"
    FAQ) have disappeared. Are you planning to change those back, as well?"
