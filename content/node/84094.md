  client chose a type direction that included modifications to Caslon Graphique. It
  is well received, but through some revisions more and more modifications were made
  to the type. I just wanted to get another set of eyes on this that know a lot more
  about type than I do. I feel like I am especially having trouble getting the 'S'
  just right. Any comments or critiques are appreciated. Thanks in advance.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SilentPartner_6013.png]"
