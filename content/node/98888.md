    notice something else: she's constantly looking at both texts - reinforcing the
    view that writing rotated text (like when lefties are forced to emulate the right-hand

    sketching thumbnails with the other.\r\n\r\nBut writing in two different languages:
    that's serious brain power."

    has the amazing the art. i have already listen about this and the detail information
    is provided by you. I have enjoyed your post especially your way of talking. Anyway,
    News are the best way to remain updated from worldwide affairs. Due to busy life
    and shortage of time i always prefer to read News highlights or BBC News Headlines
    (http://bbcnewsplanet.com/).\r\n"
