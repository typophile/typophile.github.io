  body: "\"Calm down man, its just a Clarendon!\"\r\n\r\nLOL! Touch\xE9. Perhaps the
    hyperbole is a bit much, but the original Clarendon itself doesn't have the italics
    or the weights this release has so Sentinel is more useable for text and other
    applications beyond just headlines. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I took a look at your
    work,\u2026I thought I recognized Clearview from an article and dedicated site
    I read about improving roadway signage. Great idea and great work!\r\n\r\n~ A"

  body: That's a shame; the text mentioned that bracketed serifs had been a 'liability'
    for light weights of previous Clarendons, and I wanted to see how they'd been
    executed in Sentinel.

  body: "@ William Berkson\r\n\r\nI agree with you to a certain extent. Archer is
    one of the more original slabs to have come out the past few years, and Chronicle
    is very proficient in it's use in large bodies of text. But from a historical
    perspective, Sentinel is a nice revival with added flexibility, even if it's not
    as dramatic of a departure from other clarendons.\r\n\r\n~ A"

  body: "Let me predicate this by saying that I love H&FJ types, and I've given them
    more money than I can afford as a freelancer. But...\r\n\r\nThere's an elephant
    in the Sentinel's room. Is anyone else disappointed that small caps are not included?
    We know how well a Clarendon can set real small caps by the few cuts out there
    that do include them.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I know better; H&FJ are total experts
    (and I'm sure they weighed the pros and cons of including small caps). I'm just
    saying if you're going to add yet another version of Clarendon (even if it is
    one of the best) and go all out with italics and all, it should contain small
    caps, too.\r\n\r\nMaybe they'll be released at a later date (but I don't believe
    updated releases are their style. Not sure).\r\n\r\nAll that said, I happen to
    think Sentinel is gorgeous and I still adore H&FJ."
