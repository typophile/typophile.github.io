  body: "Nice, I like it.\r\n\r\nWeights of straight strokes in your capitals need
    attention. The verticals of D and P (and maybe also B and R) are too thin. X,
    Y, Z are light, lighter, and lightest. Crossbar of H is heavy (match L).\r\n\r\nThe
    lowercase is in good shape, even the g, I think. It might be nice for the crossbar
    of the f to be a little heavier, but not necessarily. I like the short ascender
    of k."

    a bunch of other adjustments. I'll post more after I finish the numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    I also added numbers. I could use advice on the 5. No matter what I do, it doesn't

  body: 'I''m not a pro so you might want to forget about this, but the top horizontal
    stroke of the a (is there a name for that) seems to be a bit to long to me. It''s
    like an overshoot. Because the bowl of the a more round (less squared) than the
    rest it needs more overshoot. For the 5 I''d try to make the line of the inside
    of the bowl continue in the vertical stroke next to it. '

  body: Your capital G needs more whitespace, so I suggest you make it wider. All
    together it looks good, but I think you should make more weights. I'm having the
    same problem with expleus right now, because makng more weights for the same design
    is just really boring. I like your lowercase g by the way. Hope you wanna have
    a look at expletus.

    Jasper. I shortened the \"a\" a bit. I totally reworked the G. I also did some
    more work on the 5. It still doesn't look right, though. I wasn't sure what your
    suggestion (\"For the 5 I'd try to make the line of the inside of the bowl continue
    in the vertical stroke next to it.\") was getting at.\r\n\r\nI'll definitely be
    working on other weights, but not until this one is closer to completion.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    better, but it's your typeface, so feel free to do it differently.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_5312.jpg]"

  body: "Jasper,\r\n\r\nGood idea about the 5. That was actually the kind of the way
    I originally had it, before the font went in a more Eurostile direction. I then
    moved away (somewhat) from the Eurostile direction, but the 5 was still showing
    it. It's gone now. I think the 5 still needs more work, but it's getting there."

  body: "Blocko is now Corsair. Check out the new PDF in the original post. I've done
    a lot of work on a many of the previously seen characters, and I've also added
    a bunch more, as well as punctuation. I haven't done a ton of work with spacing
    at this point, and no kerning. I'm mainly concerned about shapes, widths, and
    weights at this point.\r\n\r\nAnd input is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"
