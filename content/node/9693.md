body: Hey everyone -- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for a good typeface that simulates
  a heavily-used &#40;I won&#39;t say grunge&#41; ticket or receipt printer.  I&#39;m
  looking for better fonts than what I find from searching for &#34;receipt&#34; on
  myfonts.com and would like some recomendations.  I would prefer something that looks
  like it was thermally printed like the first example below rather than dot matrix,
  but right now I could go either way with this.  <BR> <BR>Here are some scans of
  a few styles of type that I would love to find fonts for. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/6709.jpg"
  alt="tickets"> <BR> <BR>Thanks, I appreciate it!
