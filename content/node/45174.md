  professional opinion. The work sample is a logotype and a graphical profile (choice
  of colors and typefaces) for a digital media campaign aimed at young people (18\u201426).
  The purpose of the campaign is to improve the housing situation for young people
  in bigger cities through promoting community living in a fresh way.\r\n \r\nDoes
  it appeal to the target audience? Are the type choices appropriate? \r\nAny other
  thoughts, opinions, ideas?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kollektiv_profile_4376.png]"

  body: Sun Serif is a proprietary typeface of Sun Microsystems, so not only is not
    free to use, but if you're not a Sun employee or partner you probably shouldn't
    let it be known that you have it. These are the pitfalls of acquiring fonts from
    scurrilous sources.

    everything you read on the internet. Especially on that page. That website is
    a resource for people working on Sun Microsystems branding, not people who want
    free fonts."

  body: "I\u2019m just confused about the availability of the font, as Sun has moved
    away from it and the Independent uses it. Of course I would purchase the appropriate
    licences if this was a real campaign and the font would not be free to use."

    to mention it.

  body: "I was thinking about using sun as the font for body copy in everything else,
    but the web. Georgia came just from my frustration, and the ease of use on the
    web. Maybe I should go with TheAntiquaSun. I think it is subtle, yet quite strict
    and massive, and it has the same x-height as the extra light.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts_4283.png]"

  body: Yeah that would be a nice fit. Maybe just have to be careful with how prominent
    you make the logo compared with how big the body/header fonts are. There's a lot
    of style going on here.
