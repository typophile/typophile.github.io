		<div class="commentbody">If it is a PC, the font should be in the Windows/fonts folder in windows explorer. If there is a way to get it there besides draggin it, it is lost in the recesses of my morass...I mean mind.

I'm guessing from the question that you don't have a font installing program, so I am dredging this info up from long, long, ago. So I could be wrong.

Many people who use a lot of fonts, have a program like Typograf, ATM, Suitcase, etc. Something free from Linotype is popular with the Mac people.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, that is an interesting question to ask here. Most often fonts downloaded from the internet are illegal copies or of obviously bad quality. Both are frowned upon here.

But if you want to know, as always, JFGI (just f***ing google it). 
http://simplythebest.net/fonts/how_to_install_fonts.html
or
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314960/
or
just copy and paste the file into C:\Windows\Fonts.

It will automatically appear in any windows program, after you restart the program.

I am assuming you are using a windows OS.</div>

That's a rash conclusion. Most <em>purchased</em> fonts are also downloaded these days.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With such a newbie question, I can see why it would be easy to assume something like that. I didn't know there was an ethics issue until someone politely explained it in a.b.f.

I wish I knew who that was, because he was sort of a font saint, compared to the reactions of others whose bitterness seems to have poisoned their spirits.

Kind of like how movies sometimes justify cheating on your wife by showing what a jerk she is, those people make it easy to justify snagging commercial fonts (if that's the kinds of jerks that make them).

Back to the movies for a second, they didn't bother with the justification in Fatal Attraction, and that was when Ann Archer was at her prime. I was so pissed at Michael Douglas (Glenn Close?) that I had to leave the theatre when I saw where it was going.

Same thing with the latest Woodie Allen movie. I didn't care what happened to that self-absorbed moron. When I saw where that one was going I had better things to do.

Excuse the derail, but this thread was as good a one to sidetrack on as I am bound to see.
