body: "Hi guys!\r\n\r\nI am a professional translator and am making myself a website
  mostly for fun. I don't really expect to make any money off it, but I want to use
  it pretty much as an addendum to my curriculum and cover letter. I know the design
  is very bad and amateurish, but I would like to take it as far as it can and try
  to improve it a bit. Could you please check out the fonts I chose and give me some
  tips? \r\n\r\n[[http://jg-translations.com/improved.png]]\r\n\r\nThe fonts I used
  are:\r\nOpen Sans for the logo, language options, welcome text on the left, link
  descriptions on the bottom part\r\nVerdana for Services and next/previous buttons\r\nHelvetica
  for text inside the white box on the right and for the About, FAQ and Contact headers/links
  on the bottom\r\n\r\nI don't mean to offend anyone if it's inappropriate to ask
  for advice without some form of compensation. Please just ignore this thread and
  don't take it personally. I certainly don't want to cause an argument and apologize
  in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Bonus question:</strong> Sorry to abuse you guys,
  but globe or no globe on the logo? [[http://jg-translations.com/]]"

  body: "Some general tips.\r\n- No globe in its current form: it conveys the message,
    but it\u2019s way too clip-art-looking.\r\n- For a simple design like this, two
    typefaces (or even a single typeface in two weights) are more than enough. But
    you may want to differentiate the logo from the rest.\r\n- For a friendlier and
    more \u201Cbookish\u201D feel, you could also try a serif typeface."

  body: "Thanks so much for your reply!\r\n\r\nI replaced Helvetica with Verdana,
    what do you think? \r\n\r\nOld version:\r\nhttp://jg-translations.com/improved.png\r\nNew
    version\r\nhttp://jg-translations.com/improved_2.png\r\n\r\nI'm gonna play around
    with the logo. Do you recommend serif or sans-serif?\r\n\r\nps.: also changed
    the globe slightly. Do you think it's enough or would you find another one?"

  body: "One positive: your home page is not too busy. It's clear what you do and
    how to use the site. That's a great start.\r\n\r\nOn version 1: Nix the arrow
    graphic and use a real word (English to Portuguese) or punctuation (English /
    Portuguese). If you really want the arrow, use a typographic arrow, preferably
    one from the same font as the surrounding text. But any arrow will work if it
    more or less matches the text.\r\n\r\nOn version 2: You should definitely still
    say what languages you translate somewhere prominent.\r\n\r\n\"File(s)\" is unnecessarily
    fussy. Just say file.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Translations\" and not \"Translation\" in the
    header?\r\n\r\n\"Services\" is more prominent than it deserves.\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    try a serifed font. And try muting the colors. Pick only two colors and see what
    happens. Your design feels very commercial; you might want to try for something
    more literary."

  body: Thanks so much! Excellent points, I will incorporate them! And "translations"
    was just a misspelling, it had already been fixed before I read this

    do you guys think? It's far from done yet, I'm still gonna add a few things and
