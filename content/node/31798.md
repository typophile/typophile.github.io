  body: It might be a mythological representation, like an anthropomorphic capricorn
    (a symbol of the Roman god Saturn). Or possibly a combination of Pan with a capricorn.
    The Sumerian god Enki (= Babylonian Ea) also had goat/fish symbolism. No idea
    where this image is from, though.

    in the Nile by the Titan Typhon, Zeus, having defeated Typhon, placed Pan\u2019s
    new form in the sky as a constellation. You could search for Sea Goat (used by
    Aleister Crowley in his seal) another direction might be Quinotaur/Sea Bull, although
    google doesn't have your image.\r\n\r\nDoes your client have a lot of candles
