body: Trying to figure out this font, looks like Helvetica but the C is definitely
  not the same. There's also other stuff that's minimally different as well. Perhaps
  it's just been customized.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_crate_and_barrel_70i3_4258.gif]

  body: The C is custom, the rest is Helvetica. I always (without thinking about it
    much) assumed the C was Avant Garde, but AG's C is more open.

  body: Ahh yes I did think it might be that, looks like it's a modified, thinner
    version of AG in between bold and demi I think. At least that'll get you close.
    Thanks.
