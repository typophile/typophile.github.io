body: I have a friend who has given his old Mac with OS 9.2 on it to his mother. He&#39;s
  trying to track down a Latvian font to put on there so his mother can type letters
  in Latvian. Since I am lost in the world of foreign encodings, I now turn to the
  experts. Anyone here have some suggestions to point my buddy in the right direction?

  body: Latvian can be typed on a Mac using any font with a Mac Central European encoding,
    which also covers the Baltic languages &#40;note that for Windows there is a separate
    Baltic codepage&#41;. Look online for Mac CE fonts, or check out Linotype, ParaType
    or any other font retailers with a significant European presence. Adobe and other
    North American companies also develop and sell some CE fonts.
