    of words, this could very well be a typeface. Because it came from Landor Associates,
    I assumed they had it custom made and charged the client a fortune.

  body: Doesn&#39;t exist anything similar? I knew that landor did it but is it using
    another type as base? or completely custom? can I find anything similar?
