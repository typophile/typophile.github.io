body: "I am currently setting some copy for an exhibit display and had a question
  regarding the use of italic in quotes. \r\n\r\nHere is my example:\r\n\r\nThe individual
  bits of material used to create a mosaic are called \u201Ctesserae.\u201D Artist
  Emile Norman incorporated the following materials as tesserae in his endomosaic
  mural.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am setting all the copy in a regular weight, except for
  the word 'tesserae,' which will be set in an italic weight. It will only be in italic
  once, and not when it appears again in the second sentence. \r\nMy question is:
  Do I set the quote marks and the period after the word in regular or italic? Or
  is just the word itself set in italic? \r\n\r\nSorry if this is a bit basic, but
  just wanted to make sure I got it right.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    there's some discussion [[http://www.typophile.com/node/38756|here]].
