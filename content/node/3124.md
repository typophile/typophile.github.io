  body: At the publishing company I work for, we call them &#34;bugs.&#34; I&#39;ve
    also heard them referred to as &#34;end quads,&#34; presumably when the character
    is a square.

  body: Our creative team has always referred to the trademark and copyright attributions
    that we have to add to product names and various branding as &#39;bugs&#39;. I
    guess it really depends on the industry you&#39;re in.
