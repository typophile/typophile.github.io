  \r\n\r\nI came along in the days of print media and am well versed in the conventions
  for using typefaces in that context. Well, now I'm in the internet world and am
  confused. \r\n\r\nOpinions seem split right down the middle regarding the use of
  a serif typeface for body text as is generally recommended in print. Some seem to
  think sans is easier to read on screen, others continue in the serif tradition.
  (I noticed this site is using a serif face.) When working on my current project,
  I keep decreasing the view to get a sense of how something might appear on a mobile
  phone, and it does seem like sans holds up better at this scale. Any thoughts? (And
  many thanks!)"

  body: Galaxy 7 tablet for now. Eventually, I'll review on phones in both the Android
    and iphone environments. For now, I'm just wondering if there is a general consensus
    regarding serif/sans for body text among those who really know something about
    typefaces as opposed to generalized web designers.

    be better for very small text on very small screens, the web and its readers are
    not so typographically impoverished that they can't handle serifs. With 300 dpi
    resolution on some smart phones, any typeface will be pretty readable anyway.
    Even if they're somewhat less readable than sans, I think the serifs are worth
    it.\r\n\r\nActually, I think this kind of thing should be dictated by the theme
    and content of the site. So what's the site about? How long is the text? Who are
    your target readers? Etc."

    i would say that Android will often render an unhinted truetype font in much the
    same way (or better) than the same truetype manually hinted in the old school
    manner. I wonder if the old school hinting carried out for ye olde windows GDI
    is a bit overkill on todays devices? Freetype's built in autohinter seems to do
    a much better job with unhinted fonts than it's bytecode interpreter does with
    old school hinted fonts, especially given the luxury of hi res.\r\n\r\nIn terms
    of good looking type that renders well on these devices i agree with the suggestion
    of the Font Bureau RE fonts. Are they free to users though? i forget, but i'm
    guessing 'yes they are', or 'yes kind of'. But it's worth mentioning licensing
    - the web and mobile devices are increasingly reliant on typeset text being 'open'
    to all users, so the font you use is absolutely best being unrestricted too. The
    RE fonts though you will pay for per amount of bandwidth per month caused by your
    users/readers pulling the font from the server. More readers = more bandwidth
    = more $$$s. Could be a great investment, or could be the reason you go hungry
