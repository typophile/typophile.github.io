  post (that I can remember) - shocking! Anyway...\r\n\r\nMagnitude is a typeface
  I originally started back in 2001 as a modular unicase family. There was some interest
  back then from T26 but I couldn't finish it because I was too bust with work. I
  resubmitted to PsyOps but it was rejected as they said they were concentrating on
  text faces.\r\n\r\nNow, my question is... should I just finish the typeface as is
  or should I add some lowercase characters to make it more versatile? Also, any crits/suggestions
  welcome. Thanks folks."

    do think there are already enough of this kinda fonts out there, so I think your

  body: "Here's an older sample including some usage:\r\nhttp://www.stimuli.co.uk/typefaces/magnitude.pdf\r\n\r\nRene,
    thanks for your honesty :) Since this has been kicking around for a few years
    now I'm kind of indifferent to it. I thought if it was extended to upper/lowercase
    then my interest might grow again but I'm not sure how difficult it would be to
    develop the lowercase using the modular grid the rest of the face was designed
    with.\r\n\r\nI think I'd still like to pursue this face anyway, even if just to
    finally get it finished so I can stop thinking about it all the time!\r\n\r\nAny
    more comments more than welcome."

  body: I think expanding to lowercase might give you some more versatility. I don't
    know what you intend your typeface to be used for, but if it were to be used for
    magazines or posters it certainly would need lowercase as well.
