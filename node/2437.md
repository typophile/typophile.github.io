  body: It&#39;s an apple &#40;cmd-shift-k on Mac keyboards&#41;. I usually leave
    them out, but sometimes I put one in just for fun. It came out best in the Regular
    weight. I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on the apple in the bolder versions because,
    frankly, no one ever uses that character anyway &#40;except the ones that look
    like the Apple logo&#41;.

    a whole bunch of FontFont &#40;and probably other&#41;  <BR>designers use that
    location for their personal signature.  <BR>Rian Hughes for example has a whole
    series of different  <BR>ones, really funny. It&#39;s what I always do first when
    I use  <BR>a new font: check if there&#39;s an &#34;Easter Egg&#34; there.'
