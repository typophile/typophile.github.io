body: Does anyone know of a font similar with this? The name of the font appears on
  the top of the scan together with the foundry name and the year but I haven't seen
  anything like this digitized. I think it looks wonderful and I was wondering how
  the rest of the letters of the alphabet look like. So please, if anyone has some
  examples similar with this it would be great! Thank you in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bruce

    all the effort you put into uploading the specimen. I love this font! I hope to
    be able to recreate it, especially now that I know how some of the letters look
    like. I was having trouble imagining how the letters X, K, and Y would look like.
    And yes, the typeface was cut by Edwin Ruthven from the Loy's book. Thank you
    again!\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "Happy to have been of some help Stefan. My experience in making this type
    of font is that it works well if you get the basic letter forms right before doing
    the punch outs and additions such as balls attached by tendrils, or mustache split
    ends. Good luck with your project.\r\nDon"
