  lot of interesting things in there &#40;much to support, and counter&#41;, but I
  think the original topic was the most interesting. <BR> <BR>I think &#34;fauve&#34;
  is a good term here. &#34;Chunky&#34; is not. Cheltenham is not fauve. Electra is.
  <BR> <BR>The champions of fauve used to be the Czechs, now it&#39;s the South Americans.
  Down there it even seems to be becoming a full-blown Trend, with original thinkers
  but also bandwagon-hoppers. <BR> <BR>It all feels very original and meaningful,
  but might just as well implode one day, in the same way that the Emigre/PoMo stuff
  did. I hope it doesn&#39;t though: it&#39;s the perfect antidote to the naive desire
  for total control of Modernism. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    There is a certain careful carelessness <BR>about them, a quiet spiciness. Got
    any links <BR>to the foundries, Hrant?'
