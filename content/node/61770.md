body: "Ok. I'm not as well versed in type as I wish I were. So I thought I could reach
  out to this board for suggestions. \r\n\r\nHere goes. I'm working up a logo for
  a client of mine who likes what I've done with Avenir. Currently I have their company
  name set in all lowercase Avenir (reason being, the letter forms work well with
  the mark I created). They like the way everything looks except they want a capital
  \"N\" at the beginning. BUT...instead of a normal N (#1) they want me to use a lowercase
  letter and jack the size up. (oh boy #2). So I'm wondering if anybody could suggest
  something like #3 in my example but something that's not too gimicky...also like
  #3 :). [img:sites/default/files/old-images/name_4063.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks a million!"

    in example #2, to match the stroke width of the other letters?'

  body: "To get the same effect (one stroke-weight) like in nr. 3 just expand your
    text grab all the anchor-points of the \"n\" except for the four on the baseline
    and move them upwards until the stem of the \"n\" shares the height of the stem
    of the capital \"N\".\r\n\r\nIf it works it's fine if not try to adjust the stroke-weight
    of \"n\" so it's the same like in the orignal capital \"N\".\r\n\r\nI hope this
    is what you need."

    larger - the size at which it looks the\r\nsame weight as the \"lowercase\" part.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
