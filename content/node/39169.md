    status to \"married\" instead of \"in a relationship\" and assumed you meant you
    were recently married. Too much deduction on my part :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "People make facebook mistakes like that all the time. Especially since in
    the newsfeed section it doesn't list specifics. \r\nSo when you change your status
    to \"engaged\" to a good female friend to help her alleviate the embarrassment
    of breaking up with a long term boyfriend, you start receiving congratulation
    cards in the mail because no one bothered to check if you were -actually- engaged
    to your boyfriend....."
