  body: "I went at this looking for a casual non-flowing script with this 'S'. I couldn't
    find one, and it gave me a new appreciation for how distinctive script S's are.
    I only found one that I thought was pretty close to this S (in the Canada Type
    revival of Palomba called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ali-baba/\">Ali
    Baba</a>), but clearly the rest of the font is quite different.\r\n\r\nI think
    Patty's first impulse is right -- I think this is hand-drawn.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    looks almost to be a dead ringer for it.  Thanks typophilers for at least pointing
    me in some form of a direction.\r\n\r\nI should have started with your script
