  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm currently finishing up my first year of studying graphic design but I find myself already looking ahead towards grad school. While my dream is to receive my MFA from CalArts, I can't help but think realistically and speculate my chances of getting into the program. Don't get me wrong, I'm very proud and confident in the work that I've produced thus far, but I also go to a normal public university. While I absolutely love my instructors and believe in their abilities, my school isn't necessarily known for it's art department, and we have limited resources, especially when compared to our somewhat of a neighbor VCU (about 2 hours away). It's hard not to think that they've already got the upper hand for acceptance into grad programs and even the career field considering how well known and prestigious their program is. At the same time I truly believe that I'm just as hungry and have an equal amount of passion for design as any of those arrogant Richmond kids do, and that's what drives me to learn more and become better. But is that enough to mold me into a worthy CalArts student?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually Sarah I teach at VCU from time to time. I do not find the Richmond kids arrogant, but rather energetic, inquisitive and willing to go the long haul. In the whole time I have been associated with them I have only had one "slug." 

Transfer to VCU. My exposure to CalArts was through Ed Fella when I lectured in New Orleans along side him. If he is representative of that school then you are way better off going somewhere else. IMHO

I never even went to school for this stuff and it was no impediment! It has always baffled me that people think BS, MoreS, Piled Higher and Deeper is the ticket to heaven.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When you finish your studies and move to real world, your degree is of not much use. Design companies look at your portfolio, not your degree.

I went to two different design colleges, but never got a degree. I was hired due to my portfolio. Nobody asked for a degree.

If you have talent, hone it and get better; use your hours to get better at what you do, and how you do it. I actually believe that 10 000 hours of work makes you good. But take care to have a life as well; burrowing into one direction is not getting you anywhere. Be curious. And keep learning the tools of the trade; if your skills on Illustrator prevent you from doing what you want to do, it means you need more studying. That's how I made it.

Good luck.</div>

Unless you want to teach at some point. Then a degree becomes essential.

But you are right, for the real world, skill and inspiration will trump sheepskin every time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Speaking as someone without a design degree (my degree is in English), I can say that when I've been looking for jobs, the fact that I didn't have a design degree kept me from getting called for interviews, so I never had the chance to show those people my portfolio (even though I had ten years of experience). So although those hiring might really only care about what's in your portfolio, there's a good chance they might not call you to look at your portfolio without an applicable degree.</div>
