  <BR> <BR>I finally found some time to update the MADType website. If you like, check
  it out at <a href="http://www.madtype.net" target="_blank">http://www.madtype.net</a>
  and let me know if you find any bugs or errors. I got rid of the flash showings
  and added more information about the fonts. <BR> <BR>Any criticisms or comments
  will be welcomed with open arms. <BR> <BR>Matt

    <BR> <BR>Good! <BR> <BR>The news box on the right shows a horizontal scroll bar.
    Only in <BR>my default text size, though, for some odd reason. &#40;Safari, 13&#41;
    <BR>I would give it more of a right margin, currently the text hits the <BR>scroll
    bar. <BR> <BR>Variable is nice, btw. A cool alternative to VAG Rounded and the
    like.

  body: Thanks! I hadn&#39;t looked at the site in Safari yet.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad
    you like Variable, it&#39;s been my best seller recently.
