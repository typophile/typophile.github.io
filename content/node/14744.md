  is landscape on one side and portrait on the other? Does anyone have examples of
  this? I'd like to hear pros and cons of such a layout.\r\n\r\nI did a little quick
  research into how people hold/handle and flip cards, and was quite surprised that
  there are actually a number of different ways people do this.\r\n\r\n -t\r\n"

  body: I almost always flip a card the wrong way when looking at it, on the horizontal
    axis, even though I know that it will likely be upside down. The only real con
    I can think of is that in organizers, vertical has a small disadvantage. Or it
    could be an advantage, as it asks for more attention.

  body: "If you put the hard info in landscape and the more promo/splashy stuff in
    portrait, that'd probably be the best. This way you do something unique on the
    attention-getting side and keep it traditional for the side most often used in
    organizers (as Jeffrey mentioned).\r\n\r\nHonestly, I don't think mixing them
    is bad at all, as long as you aren't ingnoring any usage issues specific to the
    project. People tend to get conservative out of fear, rather than actual needs,
    with their business cards. If it fits the project, I say go for it."

  body: "\"People tend to get conservative out of fear, rather than actual needs,
    with their business cards.\"\r\n\r\nI used to agree with that until work with
    a very talented salesperson/account manager a few jobs back.\r\n\r\nHe pointed
    out how truly functional business cards can become and that they really need to
    fit the proper use. His main point, which I've found is fairly true, is that many,
    many folks still use rolodexes and, as such, it's only a good thing to have a
    landscape card with all the pertinent info on one side.\r\n\r\nA flash b-card
    is still a great ice-breaker/memory-sticker, of course, so I now tend to make
    one side of the card practical, the other side flashy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I guess I'm conservative. I wouldn't suggest rotating anything unless the
    purpose and/or reason is a conceptually appropriate thing to do.

  body: "Interesting topic to come along as i am addressing this issue currently.\r\n\r\nI
    have a graphic treatment along with the identity in front in landscape. Then i
    have two versions of the back, one an appointment card and the other a business
    card, but both have the name and contact material on both. I tried to make it
    landscape, but it came off looking odd since I didn't want to use a light background.
    So i kept the format horizontal. This by the way is for a salon.\r\n\r\nI understand
    the practical reasons for perhaps not rotating type, but maybe we all are thinking
    too much when there suddenly has to be a conceptual purpose to designing a vertical
    business card. I have a card from MetaDesign and i really don't think there was
    a conceptual purpose behind it other than differentiation. Is that conceptual
    enough?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm developing some stuff right now where 'being able to write info on the
    back' was desire voiced for the design. This pretty much eliminates dark/lush
    colors on the back, which is common for two-siders. It'll be conservative, but
    that's not a bad thing by any stretch. It's what's called for. I agree with blackbirdsign
    that concept and practicality really are married for business cards and sometimes
    the concept is catching the eye and mind of the recipient, even if they are inconvenienced
    at the rolodex.\r\n\r\nIf any of you have Punchcut's business card (it happens
    to by laying on my desktop as I write this), they've got a portrait info side,
    landscape fluff side, type in different directions, and a slightly slimmer format.
    But all of these moves work with the very restrained type to show personality
    and interest without looking like a novelty or a little circus. Plus, the design
    allows them to be distinct but still have their name in big red caps for the rolodex
    users. Sacrifice a bit of convenience for a bit of distinction.\r\n\r\nIf there's
    no reason not to make a business card stand out, why wouldn't you?"

    is what is appropriate for the specific project/task.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a
    current corporate identity on which I'm working, the \"fluff\" side worked better
    in potrait considering the type layout and messaging -- whereas the \"info\" side
    was obviously best done in landscape.\r\n\r\nI've just posted the card, letterhead,
    and envelope over here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14500\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate

  body: "I've had several cases where the front of a b-card was landscape and the
    back was portrait. My opinion is the left side of the front needs to be the top
    of the back. This works well for right-handed people. Also, there is a real world
    example of this that has been in use for many years. Your paycheck \u2013 all
    checks for that matter. Top of one side with the left of the other. That's my
    take.\r\n\r\nStrangely, I had an argument with a printer who kept ignoring my
    instructions on how I wanted this type of card setup. He insisted, as a matter
    of standards, that they always oriented the two sides right side to top. \r\n\r\nI've
    handed this type of card setup to unsuspecting people and watched how they flip
    it over. They get it right about half the time. "

  body: Put the hard information on the horizontal side and do what ever you want
    on the other side. Once in the rolledex it will never be seen. I imagine by now
    no one even keeps business cards they just plug-in the email and website info
    into their e-rolledex. That begs the reason for even doing a two sided card.

    I have seen the little multipage portfolios that people slide cards into. They
    are much like a little picture album -- but with business cards.\r\n\r\nWhat are
    the views of 'non-traditional' card sizes?\r\n\r\nWe normally don't work with
    a size that is larger than the standard convention (3.5\" x 2\")."
