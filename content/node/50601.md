    the spine of the S, G. Unger purports that a short straight segment in the spine
    (which involves 4 nodes) benefits the structure of the letter. As with anything
    in typeface design, the answer to a general question is likely to involve the
    following phrases: ''it depends'' and ''use your eyes''.'

    right. A serif face would obviously need more.\r\n\r\nAlso, nice illustrations
    in Hudson's post in that thread. Sometimes the spine can use additional nodes,
    but in my (limited, but still) experience so far, I usually don't seem to need
    them all that often."

    help myself. But there is some truth behind it. 12 nodes for the S-curve. Then
    if the curve has serifs or not thats another story. But I think that if you want
    it really smooth, then 12 nodes is the best. But sometimes the S have a straighter
    area aomewhere along the \"big curve\" and then of course it needs more nodes.\r\nIt
    is however very good practice to draw an S with only 12 nodes, I believe."

    think this is usually safest, as you must be an expert curve handler to add more
    without making the spine look 'kinky'. but i believe that in certain circumstances,
    the spine might benefit from additional control which necessitates more points."

    Even if these days FontLab is smarter than that, somewhere along the line (like
    the RIP of an output device, or a PostScript emulator) you might hit problems,
    so it's safer to place vertices there (usually towards the very end of the design
    process).\r\n\r\nFunny things can also happen when you have a curve that ends

    looking for simple--and not so simple--geometry for centuries and haven't found
    it. Almost everything in letters violates simple, regular geometry, because that's
    not the way the eye-brain combo works. And the S has one of the most complex shapes.
    \r\n\r\nIn the case of the S and s, a basic principle is that the bottom part
    needs to be bigger than the top part. This follows two principles, both of which
    violate simple geometry. The first is that when you split something vertically,
    the divide, to look equal, generally has to be higher than equally bisecting the
    space vertically. The second principle is that the top part needs to be narrower
    than the bottom, to look more secure and stable. Hence the top arm of the E is
    often shorter, and the top of the K, S and X smaller and narrower than the bottom.
    Similar stuff happens in the lower case. You can see the same principles at work
    in the design of furniture, buildings, etc. "

    designers to overdo these two required differences, rather than to get the top
    and bottom to look right. The same thing can be said of many overshoots which
    end up looking too big and ink traps which can distort the look of a character.
    It's as if some designers want you to know that they have attended to such issues,
    but end up only making more trouble. There is one logo which I always think has
    O's (or S's) that are far too tall when I see it on trucks in UK but I can't remember
    for the life of me which it is. Think it might be <a href=\"http://www.tesco.com\">Tesco</a>?"

  body: Hrant, I get that William is right, but some designs have overcompensated
    on overshoot for sure. Maybe required overshoot is a subjective issue!? You're
    not telling me though that fonts should have smaller relative overshoots the larger
    they get, other than remaining in proportion to the font size, are you? Surely
    that's just maths. If it's not then I have to pack up and go home. No designer
    is expected to design fonts at different sizes. Maybe you are telling me that.
    I know some designers have offered different fonts depending on the weight you're
    going to use (as well as different 'grades') but I never thought that overshoot
    would have been different between them...

  body: "> fonts should have smaller relative overshoots the larger they get\r\n\r\nSmaller
    <em>absolute</em> overshoots (meaning in the font design). Which makes sense.
    Plus it's mentioned in a footnote in Harry Carter's edition of Fournier.\r\n\r\n>
    No designer is expected to design fonts at different sizes\r\n\r\nWhy not, since
    scale affects the net results? Before digital type (actually before phototype...
    actually before the pantograph) a given font design was for one size only, and
    was -generally- designed to be optimal at that size. Now the convenience of using
    a font at any size has overpowered the sense not to. Sure, a give font can serve
    within a range of sizes not just a single size, so scaling is useful, but in practice
    this range is quite narrow. Fortunately during the past decade many type designers
    have started seeing the light: they point out the scalar limits of their designs
    (like indicating whether it's a text font or a display font) and some of them
    even make different cuts within the text range.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
