body: The Last couple versions of ID have abandoned Meta, for a new -- and in my opinion
  -- much more appropriate serifed face. Unfortunately I dont have a scan, but would
  somone have the mag handy for an ID &#40;no pun intended&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: 'The answer is on page 19 of the Jan/Feb 2004 issue: <BR>&#34;In the new design,
    by current art director Nico Schweizer, the workhorse typeface Scala used for
    body copy has been replaced by Coranto, a font created by Gerard Unger in 2000.
    Meta, which appeared in headlines, will be succeeded by a variety of typefaces
    that will change over time. We start with Gotham, designed by Tobias Frere-Jones
    with Jesse Ragan for the Hoefler Type Foundry.&#34;'

  body: Ahh, damn I was just saying to my partner here, that looks quite a lot like
    Ungers work, but couldnt place it. Thanks. I might actually read through this
    mag once in a while now <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>. Although not being an &#39;industrial designer&#39;,
    I really find very little use for the mag, aside from something for client to
    flip through. On the subject of magazines, I recently picked up a subscription
    to STEP, which had a great layout on type in this current issue, highlighting
    Bilak&#39;s work and some other great articles. <BR> <BR>On a fairly different
    note, who designed the face for the new york times? Was that Unger? it has quite
    a similar &#39;feeling&#39;. <BR> <BR>Cheers. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: Yves, I see you closed this out with &#39;Scala&#39; as the answer, but it
    was really <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-coranto.html" target="_blank">&#39;Coranto&#39;
    by Gerard Unger</a> that was the answer to the question.

  body: That&#39;s what you get when an ID is posted without sample.  <BR>I misinterpreted
    the explanation. Thanks for keeping an  <BR>eye out for me Mike! Have a wonderful
    New Year&#39;s Eve  <BR>celebration tonight.
