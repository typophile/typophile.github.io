body: "I have recently purchased Quadraat Sans for use on a website and noticed it
  has some buggy hinting in Cyrillic glyphs at 17 px size. And I am just not going
  to use a different size.\r\nThat is, horizontal stems of letters \"\u044D\", \"\u0437\",
  \"\u0454\", \"\u043D\" are pixel lower than they should be \u2014 a really crucial
  detail in a Cyrillic font. And it ruins this font.\r\n\r\nSo I want to correct TrueType
  hinting of those letters. I know it's kinda illegal to do that, but that's not stealing
  a font or making a copycat and selling it. Just want to fix the bugs.\r\n\r\nI have
  never dealt with hinting. So I had googled a lot, found some tutorials, but most
  of them are soo difficult to understand. TrueType hinting seems to be a mysterious
  process even for some of the authors of those tutorials.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from
  the image, I managed to correct the \"\u043D\" with delta-hinting. It was a pain
  for me to figure it out how (and why) to hint that \"\u043D\" without distorting
  the glyph at other ppems, though the letter has such an easy shape.\r\n\r\nNow that
  I know, that to do delta hints I have to set other hints, I struggle to do it with
  \"\u044D\", \"\u0437\", \"\u0454\"\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any help, any single
  word of advice a whole lot.\r\nAll I want is to bring that stem one pixel up at
  17 ppem without distorting glyphs' shapes at other ppems.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hinting_6057.png]"

    option may be to write to info@fontfont.de with your problem so the foundry can
    fix it in the original data and other users can benefit from it too :)

    I highly doubt they'll fix it immediately, so I still want to fix it myself"

  body: "Regarding fixing it youself: I think delta instructions are the least intrusive
    way to fix this if you don't have access to the source files.\r\n\r\nIf you use
    other instructions, the Control Value Table in the font has to be rewritten. I'm
    not sure how well FontLab handles that case, if something goes wrong then all
    kinds of bad things may happen."

  body: "Sooner or later, you have to accept the fact that there are some limitations
    you cannot overcome.\r\n\r\nAlthough your targeted example says \u201C17ppem,\u201D
    the glyph itself is probably 14ppem high, or perhaps 12ppem. If the actual glyph
    height is an even number, you will <strong>never</strong> be able to center the
    midline: it will <strong>always</strong> appear either above or below true center.
    At larger sizes, the shift will be less apparent, but it won't go away entirely.\r\n\r\nGiven
    that the 17ppem problem is insuperable, the solution to your problem is really
    quite simple: don't use the font at that size."

  body: "It is 8 ppem there. And yes I know that it's not possible to center a midline.\r\nIt's
    completely natural for Cyrillic letters if these horizontal stems are higher,
    than the letters' center. I recon there are some fonts, which have these stems
    quite high. And never lower than midline, even in Cyrillic handwriting.\r\n\r\nSo
    as I said, they should be exactly a pixel higher.\r\n\r\n\r\nJens, just curious,
    what software do you use for hinting?"

    types for font sizes that work. . . if one is not crude media savvy, sometimes
    listening is best.\r\n\r\nAlso, \r\n\"...the glyph itself is probably 14ppem high...\"\r\n\r\n...ppm
    refers exclusively to pixels per em. Once you start talking pixels per cap ht,
    e.g. it's no longer ppm, but simple pixels. \r\n\r\n\"If you use other instructions,
    the Control Value Table in the font has to be rewritten\"\r\n\r\nDeltas will work
    if placed correctly. The cvt might be used, but because there is often slight
    variety in the optical centering of middle strokes, one can alternatively interpolate
    the top of the mid stroke between the glyph's y min and y max, set rounding to
    sround 73 and mdap it, avoiding the cvt, while never having the mid stroke too
    low..."

    will never be able to center the midline: it will always appear either above or
    below true center.\"\r\n\r\n...is untrue. If the glyph pictured above were 16
    pixels tall, the stems would each be 2 pixels, which subtracted from 16 leaves
    10 \u2014 a number that evenly divides by two, enabling a centered mid-line. At
    17, an odd-numbered pixel height, the mid-line would not center.\r\n\r\nI believe
    mid-line centering is about white pixels, not height pixels. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>Jens, just curious, what software do you use for hinting?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe
    are using FontLab Studio. The problem, or rather just the way it works, is that
    FontLab cannot open a TTF and reconstruct the hinting \"source code\". For the
    most effective way to edit the TT hinting you need the source FontLab file. In
    your example screenshots, the alignment zones and stem width values are something
    that FontLab made up by guessing when it opened the TTF."
