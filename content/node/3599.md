  body: How old  is  &#39;old&#39;? Are we talking 1930&#39;s? Pre-digital? Pre-film
    type? Can you give us some placement in time for the sample?

  body: from bbc.co.uk <BR> <BR>Made in 1984, the production was a daring mixture
    of live action and animation, and included a large number of complicated visual
    effects. Unusually, a lot of them still look impressive today. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'I think it could be the old Headliners version called neo-Belwe. The one
    at MyFonts is the Letraset version from the late &#39;70s, but it&#39;s not the
    only attempt to revive the 1926 original. Here&#39;s a scan from a Headliners
    one-line specimen book: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28601.gif"
    alt="neobelwe"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve condensed the B weight to approximate the title
    sample. The details seem to match where they don&#39;t in the Letraset version.
    Notice, for example, the bracket in the bottom counter of the B and the treatment
    of the ascender on the lowercase l. The lowercase e may be tilted clockwise slightly.
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, this is the only sample of it I have. Headliners never
    showed complete alphabets in their samples.'

    picked up the Headliners library in the early days of the digital font era and
    currently sells some of it. I wonder if he would be able to confirm this.

  body: I&#39;ve written to Joe a few times in the past and he has helped by providing
    samples of some of his fonts for my Guides. I can write and see what he can add
    on this.

  body: 'Hello, all - <BR> <BR>Good eye, Mark! You&#39;re right; it was originally
    created using Headliners&#39; neo-Belwe B weight. The actual typeface is sharper
    than this sample, by the way. Here&#39;s where the confusion sets in: The tail
    of g is actually cut and pasted from a different Headliners typeface. My guess,
    without actually trying it, is Headliners&#39; neo-French Oldstyle &#40;for which
    there was only one weight&#41;. The D looks like it may have not come from Headliners&#39;
    neo-Belwe, but instead from another Headliners series called neo-Pageantry. Very
    similar D. I looked in a number of specimen books before replying, and have found
    no other typefaces that do this combination of things, all in one design. <BR>
    <BR>To Jess Gorick: We have not yet digitized these faces, but if you just need
    the letters as shown above, we can do that for you rapidly. <BR> <BR>Feel free
    to e-mail me directly if you are interested. <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR>

    78% of its normal width, based on the sample originally shown. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR>

  body: Joseph, your right on the money! as the original jpg I posted is a digitised
    still from a 14:9 aspect ratio, that I forgot to re-stretch from 4:3 <BR> <BR>so
    long story short, it was about 78%. <BR>Unfortunately the bbc have decided their
    original font isn&#39;t &#39;magical&#39; enough so Ive got to change direction.
    <BR> <BR>thanks for all your help <BR> <BR>Jess
