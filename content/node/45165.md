  Frutiger Condensed Italics (Frutiger Com 48 Light Condensed Italic, Frutiger Com
  58 Condensed Italic, Frutiger Com 68 Bold Condensed Italic, Frutiger Com 78 Black
  Condensed Italic, Frutiger Com 88 Extra Black Condensed Italic)\r\nDoes anyone know
  of such a pack?\r\n\r\nI've looked on LinoType and Fonts.com, can't find a Pack
  of just that? (Am I blind??)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nthx"

  body: I'd be surprised if there were a package with just italics. It seems to me
    if they make packages, don't they usually include the roman variant?
