  Academic Journal (a law review) and am looking for examples of well-done interior
  design in this medium. \r\n\r\nMost U.S. law journals use Times, fake small caps,
  fake superscripts, vertical space between consecutive paragraphs, unconscientious
  justification, etc. Any examples (in any field) to the contrary? Thanks. "

  body: "I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really the type of examples you\u2019re awaiting,
    but you can look up nearly any math journal. They all use LaTeX, so have a minimal
    quality standard (true small caps, true superscript, etc.), even though the font
    is often Computer Modern (which is one of the only font to have true optical sizes
    from 10pt down to 5pt).\r\n\r\nSee, for example, the [[http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/0000-000-00/|Bulletin
    of the American Mathematical Society]]."

  body: "Are you looking for a design, or a typeface? For example, Times does have
    true-cut small caps, true-cut superiors, etc. etc. Failure to use is just a liability
    issue...Just specifying a different typeface may not solve anything. And the composition
    has nothing to do with the design...\r\n \r\nBTW, does it have to follow the Harvard
    Blue style?"

  body: "It does have to conform to bluebook style, so the footnotes will be heavy
    with small caps and so forth.\r\n\r\nPart of the redesign will definitely find
    involve getting a new type family that has SCs, italic SCs, superiors, and ideally
    a display weight and a pi font. I've got a few ideas in mind--but that isn't the
    hard part.\r\n\r\nI was asking for designs because I've had such a hard time finding
    any journals that seem *designed* instead of just the product of a Word macro
    or LaTeX (we'll be using the former, sadly). I'm sure I can do a competant job
    producing something that looks good and doesn't violate the conservative norms
    of the medium, I just prefer to have seen a couple examples of good work before
    I set out on my own."

  body: "OK, part of your problem, I think, is that MS Word may not support the typographic
    features you yearn for, even if they are in the font. Best check that out.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, you need InDesign to do a professional job. Maybe there is an educational
    discount? Or, get a contribution from some lawyer who has just gotten a large
    settlement? (Hard to have money sympathies for lawyers, doctors, etc.)\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    the hard part of *design* for a journal is trying to cover all the things the
    author's come up with. Varying list styles, extract styles, etc. etc. You'll see.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."

    rather than Word. Unfortunately it's not cheap, and there's a learning curve,
    but your results will be much more professional.  \r\n\r\nYou might want to consider
    having a graphic designer handle the design and also the production of each issue.
    The results will be more professional."

  body: "I'm aware of the limitations of Word\u2014I worked as a typesetter and graphic
    designer in print publishing for a few years before starting law school, and I've
    been an InDesign proponent since CS2. \r\n\r\nProblem is, the editorial workflows
    of most LRs don't lend themselves to professional typesetting. Most journals operate
    on a shoestring budget, and the typical workflow has  the upper-level editors
    overseeing the process of typesetting the manuscript using VBA macros supplied
    by the company that does the vast majority of LR publishing. \r\n\r\nEven if we
    could afford multiple seat licenses of the software, training anyone besides myself
    wouldn't be an option, since the turnover in LR boards is annual. I love working
    in LaTeX\u2014and it's a less expensive option\u2014but most law students are
    scared to death of anything that looks like code.\r\n\r\nThe control over paragraph
    composition in Word is abysmal, but the VBA Word macros use now supports things
    like kerning, tracking, ligatures, and certain opentype features. It offends my
    sensibilities as a typographer, but working within Word is the best option I have
    as far as making sure that any improvements I make aren't lost as soon as I graduate.
    It's a compromise, but if we can become the *only* law review in the entire country
    not to use fake small capitals, I will be very happy. "

  body: 'For all  know, Word will fake the small caps even if true-cut are in the
    font. The work-around, of course, is to use an old-style Type-1 font format, where
    the small caps are in the lower-case a-z position, and do a font change when you
    need small caps. But given your work flow, that''s still a bit awkward. '

    exact ones, but maybe try JAMA or the New England Journal of Medicine.

    played around with getting true-cut characters in ebooks, which is essentially
    the same problem. Putting them in the old ASCII positions in separate fonts is
    the only solution I've come up with, for both small caps and superiors. There
    are several problems with this: First, kerning is blocked across font changes.
    If you want it, it is handwork. \r\n\r\nAnd with the small caps, anyway, you now
    have the wrong character, a lower-case letter where a cap should (usually) be.
    I solved this by putting the small caps in both the upper & lower case ASCII positions,
    but given the legal style, that would just increase your burden. Still, if a \"display\"
    (print & ebook) edition is all you care about -- no syntactically correct Unicode
    files ever needed -- this approach would work.\r\n\r\nTo do all this right, you'll
    swapped the expense of InDesign for the expense of FontLab. Or maybe you can work
    in the <cite>Libre</cite> program, FontForge..."
