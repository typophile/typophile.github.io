    target="_blank"> ITC Weidemann Book</a>, I presume. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not
    <i>that</i> unpleasant, is it? You&#39;re probably breaking  <BR>Mr. Weidemann&#39;s
    heart.

  body: OK, Apologies to Mr Weidemann - its probably not <i>that</i> bad, just a very
    long way from what would be my choice - too bland for my taste, and I don&#39;t
    like the big lumpy finial on the C. <BR>Apologies to Typophiles everywhere for
    posting a bmp instead of a gif or jpg. Recent browsers seem to happily handle
    bmps, but maybe its a mime-types thing? Anyway I should have read the instructions
    properly. <BR>Thanks to Yves for such a rapid response.

  body: Hey Steve, chill! I apply &#39;winkies&#39; to my posts for a reason,  <BR>yaknow.

    I certainly didn&#39;t want to sound paternalistic! Unless  <BR>I misread your
    post too and you&#39;re <i>not</i> being defensive. ;&#41;  <BR>My remarks were
    all in good humour; I just wanted to help. <BR> <BR>Online communication is prone
    to misunderstandings, whether  <BR>you apply a gazillion emoticons or none. Always
    has been,  <BR>always will be. <BR> <BR>Anyhoo, glad I could help. See you later
    on the boards.
