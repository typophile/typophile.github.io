    using CSS for varying columns is a huge PITA at the moment. Prince, however, seems
    to actually support CSS-3 fully, which DOES allow for columnar layouts. One example:
    http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS3_Columns\r\n\r\nI agree, this is not

    publisher would expect nothing less. Does CSS do that and if it does, is it still
    a cascading style sheet?\"\r\n\r\nI have no answer for that (though would love
    to hear one). But, to add to the topic, it seems as if most successful papers
    are moving a lot of their ad revenue towards their online existence as advertiser
    depend less and less on the print medium for advertising. So this may very well
    become a nice addition to, rather than replacement of, current systems. It's been
    a decade since I've worked in a paper, though (which, at the time, was MS Word,
    cut and pasted into XPress [and then printed, cut, and waxed onto the keylines...those
    were the days...] and then cut and pasted into a primitive HTML editor where we
    published each article manually onto a static HTML site.)\r\n\r\n\"Which we all
    know web design/xhtml/css to NOT be. (See Exhibit A, Internet Explorer, any version.)\"\r\n\r\nAgain,
    Prince isn't a web browser. It's a HTML/XML to PDF renderer. The appeal is that
    it does support a much fuller set of the CSS spec (especially for print) than
    any current web browser.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, this is using proper CSS, but XML/SGML

    certainly aren't printing out everything they read like the old folks.\r\n\r\nAnother
    good example of this would be handwriting itself. Whereas handwriting used to
    be used for everything, it was replaced in large part by printing. It was replaced
    further by typewriters and morse code. Computers, personal printers and email
    further relegated it to a niche purpose. Texting and t9 have even replaced it
    for notes passed under the desk in junior high school. Now it's rare that we use
    handwriting to communicate with anyone but ourselves, rarely over distances, and
    almost never archivally. Sometimes it serves a nostalgic or ceremonial purpose,
    like for handwritten thank you notes.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the same thing happens
    with words as they are replaced by new ones: the old words take on more specialized
    meanings.\r\n\r\nAs for a date where printing will be gone from the face of the
    earth: probably never. As for a date where it started to fade, just look at the
    sales charts for paper newspapers, paperback books and annual report design, to
    name a few. Moving forward the act of stamping ink on paper will likely fill a
    niche purpose, at best for something useful or artistic, at worst for nostalgia
    alone. Unfortunately there will be typographic quality lost in the translation
    (ie that last 20%), especially at first.\r\n"

  body: "As to the original post, I fail to see the scandal. Forget all the rhetorics
    (20% vs 80%, death of InDesign), just stick to what he actually presented.*\r\nThe
    presentation makes it clear that Mr Lie is not a typographer, see his selection
    of 'good' typefaces or the fact that he does not seem much interested in OpenType
    except for the fancier features. I do not even care since in the more fundamental
    issues he is pretty right: The HTML+CSS model is (or allows to be) quite strict
    in separating two independent domains which are, first, structured data, and second,
    (graphic or typographic) representation of these.\r\n\r\nI think that in the long
    run, typographers will need to think of design in a more structured and abstract
    way. Designing nice books or brochures manually and individually by placing frames
    on a virtual page and filling these with given texts or images, is one thing.
    It is another thing to 'design' design rules -- the actual design results from
    (automatically) merging data and design rules. This is nothing to be afraid of,
    it can help make the design process more efficient. And this does not necessarily
    result in a loss of quality: What did the most traditional book designers do?
    Define the design rules. See the beautiful sketches by Jan Tschichold or Max Caflisch.\r\nWith
    this in mind, I consider ther HTML+CSS approach as pretty interesting. Another
    example is <a href=\"http://www.docscape.de\" target=\"_blank\">DocScape</a> (cannot
    find an English version). This system allows to program very complex design rules,
    and one command will merge these with texts and images from any database and generate
    a PDF of an entire catalog or book. Its developers claim that this is much different
    from scripting layouts in InDesign or XPress in that these fill fixed template
    pages or frames with content while in their system the layout by default is supposed
    to be programmed such that it can deal with texts and images of various length
    or size, e.g. using two columns instead of three.\r\n'Defining design' rather
    than 'designing' requires that designers or typographers are able to think of
    design abstractly.** And to make designers (myself included) feel comfortable
    with this it needs appropriate visually oriented tools. This is a particularly
    interesting question for which I have not seen solution. How would such a tool
    represent a layout, and allow designing it, if there is no 'content' yet? Would
    it be possible to create such a layout visually nevertheless -- and also <em>show</em>
    which parts of the layout are fixed and which parts remain variable? In short,
    how to represent virtual representation of data?\r\nNobody seems to have made
    an attempted to address this. Current solutions either force designers to fix
    text and image snippets on a digital page (PageMaker, XPress, InDesign), or require
    developers rather than designers (like LiveCycle, can anybody explain this to
    me in an afternoon?). There is nothing inbetween.\r\n\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;I think
    it was Mr Lie who made an interesting remark in the presentation: The actual typographic
    representation, which also includes things like hyphenation or optical margin
    alignment, is not up to CSS itself but to the browser or PDF generator.\r\n**&nbsp;&nbsp;For
    this reason, web designers and developers may easier adapt than print designers.
    Also I am not surprised that all these technologies, PrinceXML, but also AIR and
    WPF emerged from the web &amp; UI design rather than the print world. My impression
    is that currently there are pretty exciting things under way, including the above-mentioned
    technologies. Many of these have the potential to change the way we think of design:
    By allowing to address document (or print) design, web design, UI design in the
    same 'language' they may help overcome the strict distinction of these three --
    they have more in common than previous design tools (special tools for each of
    them) suggested. The <em>real</em> distinction is between data and their representation.
    The same data can be represented in a book or on the screen, or these data may
    be opend up for manipulation, then the form of representation turns out to be
    a UI.)\r\n\r\nAs an aside, it is with more or less automatic design in mind that
    I think that fonts need to be spaced and kerned well enough that no or very little
    intervention by the typographer is required. And OpenType helps a lot with this.\r\n\r\n\r\nKarsten\r\n\r\n"

    of itself. It's style markup language. Consider it like printers marks on the
    margins of a proof. Given that a lot of content is now being natively stored in
    XHTML and XML and the like, CSS seems like a perfectly logical extension. Now,
    whether or not Prince is 'the tool' is certainly debatable, but I certainly see
    CSS as the future. Rather than XPress styles, InDesign styles, Word Styles, we'd
    have one standard: CSS. If anything, and if the moons align, we might see InDesign
    eventually just use CSS natively within the application. \r\n\r\n\"I\u2019m a
    bit bemused by folks putting down Adobe-promoted standards relating to typography.\"\r\n\r\nNothing
    wrong with [insert big software corporation] promoted standards. It's when they
    are also solely owned by said entity that some of us tend to start rooting for
    the open standard instead.\r\n\r\nAnd yea, I can't think of any Type-centric standards
    that Adobe has created that have been anything BUT a boon to the industry. I,
    personally, just have qualms about the Adobe vs. Microsoft issues as we go forward
    in trying to agree on standardization of content storage in general. If you're
    in a business where part of your requirements is to pump content out to the public
    at-large, then open HTML begins looking like the best solution. As it is now,
    one-click exporting from print documents into an easy to publish HTML format is
    still a bit of a dream for most DTP apps (though, admittedly, a big part of that
    is simply lack of application user training/knowledge).\r\n\r\nAs for calling
    these gentlemen out for a lack of type knowledge, I think that's valid...they
    are clearly more technology orientated and seem to be focused on a lot of university
    and scientific documentation (which is the origins of the web). But I don't think
    that invalidated their vision...if anything, it should be a call to arms to help
    them improve the product based on the needs of the professional typesetter/designer.\r\n\r\n\"Still
    lingering or malingering does go on. Vinyl sales are up in a big way....\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is maybe for an entirely different thread, but I find that point very interesting.
    Why is that? Clearly, part of that is the fact that it's a tangible item. Perhaps
    that's the appeal of Prince for some? It turns the intangible screen of HTML into
    a tangible book?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree emphatically with Joe that referencing fonts in CSS is fundamentally
    broken. It's an even bigger problem because a lot of apps and other \"things\"
    out there want to \"use\" CSS as part of their text model, and when they try to
    deal with how one specifies a specific font, they have to deal with the fact that
    what constitutes a font \"family\" is fundamentally ambiguous and under-specified
    in CSS.\r\n\r\nEach implementer usually ends up coming with their own, incompatible
    notion of how the CSS spec maps fonts and families to *actual specific fonts*
    and the end result is not pretty. I've seen many software dev teams hit this issue
    over the years, especially recently.\r\n\r\nYou know it's a problem when somebody
    has to write an 18-page spec on how to get from actual fonts to CSS font families
    and individual fonts.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm not convinced there is any fundamental
    barrier to doing pretty good typography in CSS some day. It will probably need
    some extensions to CSS, whether that's CSS 4 (or later) or something more proprietary.\r\n\r\nBut
    it would be a mistake to dismiss the entire concept just because the current implementation
    is limited. Metal typesetters made fun of phototype at first, and phototypesetters
    thought digital type was much too limited... but each technology evolved, and
    even the initial implementations often had compelling advantages that gained them
    many early converts. So it is with CSS based typography, I think.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    users in the corner has caused some remarks. I think InDesign will live a long
    and happy life, but I do believe the web will live even longer. Including CSS.
    Which is why it's important that it works well for all sorts of uses. \r\n\r\nI
    proposed CSS in 1994 and it's been an important part of my life since then. My
    motivation for doing this work is twofold. First, it's important that the markup
    languages of the web are spared from holding all the typographic and presentational
    information that we want to associate with documents. Second, we need ways to
    express beautiful typography and design for web documents.\r\n\r\nI have described
    CSS and compared it with other style sheet languages in my PhD Thesis:\r\n\r\n
    \  http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/\r\n\r\nSo far, I think CSS has been
    reasonably successful in establishing a baseline foundatation for style sheets
    on the web, and -- by now -- all browsers supports CSS1 reasonably well. It's
    also clear that much work remains in advancing the specifications further, and
    to ensure that they are interoperably implemented by browsers and other formatters
    (e.g., Prince). I think the Typofile community can play an important role here.
    \r\n\r\nOne of the things I have been pushing in the last year is web fonts. The
    web is stuck with 10 or so fonts that Microsoft published in 1996. They have served
    us well, but we need more fonts in order to improve typography on the web. There
    are thousands of freely usable fonts on the web but there is a missing link; browsers
    don't support the linking of fonts from style sheets to font files. I'm trying
    to change this; I want browsers to support the CSS2 specification from 1996 which
    described how to do this.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.news.com/Microsofts-forgotten-monopoly/2010-1032_3-6085417.html\r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten\r\n\r\nPrince
    now supports Web Fonts, as does nightly builds of Safari. We're working on it
    in Opera, too. \r\n\r\nA common argument against webfonts is that not all TrueType
    files out there are good enough for web use. They may have limited unicode coverage,
    lack ligatures or simply look horrific. Some people have commisioned studies that
    say only a fraction of the fonts are suitable for web use!\r\n\r\nI think that's
    great news! 5% of thousands is still plenty of new fonts. As support for webfonts
    increase, I think web designers will start using them in creative ways which will
    result in more fonts being developed, with wider unicode coverage etc. The tide
    will rise for all of us.\r\n\r\nSome of you may worry that webfonts is threat
    to your existing business models and that font piracy will increase when everyone
    can point to a font file on the web. While it's true that linking is very powerful,
    there are also ways to restrict it. For example, a web server can check the 'Referer'
    field in HTTP and only serve fonts to those requests coming from a sanctioned
    list of documents. This is not a failsafe method -- it's probably as easy to crack
    as the EOT obfuscation -- but it will stop much abuse. \r\n\r\nOn a more technical
    topic, I'm working on extending the 'font-variant' propoerty in CSS to better
    select fonts with OpenType features. Would this be of interest in this forum?\r\n\r\nhttp://people.opera.com/howcome/"

    have always distributed commercial fonts illegally. Will font embedding change
    that, principally? Not really. However, the fonts that will be linked against
    web pages will be much easier to discover than the illegally distributed archives
    that are RARed, ZIPped, password protected and uploaded on rapidshare.com or something
    like that. And, sure, there will be some additional piracy going on, but there
    will be also a chance to obtain additional license fees from legitimate customers
    who will WANT to embed their fonts into wed pages using the direct linking mechanism.
    A font foundry will have a good argument to charge additional money for that type
    of license -- the foundry can argument that, indeed, the font files are being
    made accessible to the public without any protection, so the customer has to pay
    considerably more. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the pirates wouldn't have paid anyway,
    so the loss is only theoretical, while the potential gain is actual since there
    are real money-making possibilities due to additional licensing sales. OpenType
    was one chance to cash in on potential font upgrades to clients who had happily
    used their Type 1 fonts before that. The Euro character also such a chance. Web
    font embedding will be another. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    In practice, how much extra in the way of additional licensing fees will font
    makers or vendors deem such usage to be worth, and will customers be willing to
    pay that amount for using a font on a webpage?\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head,
    I imagine I would be charging between $500 and $1000 U.S, possibly a good deal
    more, for this kind of licensing, depending on the font. And I'm only a smallfry
    independent font maker. How much would a large 'foundry' charge? Some of them
    put up to a million dollars into the development of one font (or a font family,
    say). If only two license sales are possible for web use, the fee will be hefty.\r\n\r\n<em>In

    license sales for web use I can see, but font makers who put their wares up for
    this arrangement can virtually kiss future retail license sales of their commercial
    font products goodbye once those fonts become widely distributed for free courtesy
    of the server somewhere in Russia syndrome.\r\n\r\n<em>I think one problem that

  body: "> will customers be willing to pay that amount for using a font on a webpage?\r\n\r\nSure
    thing. When developing websites, people pay for hosting services, web development,
    design, photos. And people who make print publications regularly pay for fonts.
    I think companies will be delighted to pay for font web use if this will allow
    them to break free from the Verdana-Georgia-Arial closet.  \r\n\r\n> can virtually
    kiss future retail license sales of their commercial font \r\n> products goodbye
    once those fonts become widely distributed for free \r\n> courtesy of the server
    somewhere in Russia syndrome.\r\n\r\nVirtually ALL commercial fonts ARE already
    in distribution \"for free courtesy of the server somewhere in Russia syndrome\",
    and have been FOR YEARS -- just like software from Microsoft, Adobe, FontLab etc.
    -- on Usenet, rapidshare, various forums, BitTorrent etc. etc. etc. \r\n\r\nI
    have not seen font distributors or software distributors \"kissing goodbye retail
    sales\" in the past years. Plus, as I said -- unlike illegitimate use in print,
    which is difficult to track down, illegal use of fonts that will be linked directly
    to web pages will be the easiest thing to discover. After all, that use will be
    indexed by Google and stored pretty much forever at archive.org. \r\n\r\nThe fact
    that I put up an image or a font on my site and use it with my content does not
    mean that that image or font is \"available for free\". Everyone knows that they
    cannot freely use any stuff just because they were able to download it from \"the
    internets\" -- including software, graphics, and now fonts. Most people are very
    aware of what piracy is, and know at least the fundamental difference between
    legitimate and illegitimate use of software assets. If font distributors make
    it easy enough for people to pay for those assets and use them the way they wish,
    people WILL pay. \r\n\r\nWhy am I sure? Because that's what they're already doing.
    It is already easy to download pirated fonts from a number of sources, and it
    is quite possible to extract font outlines from PDF documents, Flash files, Word
    documents. And? People are still paying for fonts. Chris, kids have been paying
    for mobile phone ringtones and icons, and that business is worth millions. \r\n\r\nPirates
    can rub their butts sore uploading fonts to Russian servers all day long -- yet
    only a considerably small proportion of users will link to those and use them.
    And those users wouldn't probably pay anyway. But once this thing sets off, the
    people who HAVE THE MONEY and are willing to pay WILL PAY. \r\n\r\nFacebook has
    over 50 million users, MySpace is rumored to have twice as many. I dare to say
    that no less than 5% of those would be willing to pay a small amount of money
    (like $10) for the ability to customize their profile appearance using a different
    font. It's a fraction of what people spend on buying silly t-shirts.  \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    lot to be said for positive thinking on this issue, as font makers and those selling

    I think the new situation is not as simple as proponents make it out to be. We
    need more input on this from larger font makers and vendors. My perspective is
    of limited scope. It has been a while since I monitored font piracy, so the current
    extent of it is unfamiliar.\r\n\r\n@Adam: <em>This is why you should forget about

    if your proposed EULA prohibits screen rendering, does that mean vendors will
    not be permitted to show potential buyers what your font(s) look like? If so,
    selling any retail licenses at all will be rather difficult.\r\n\r\nThe answer
    is to trust everyone, but cut the cards. In other words, at a minimum you should
    trust vendors and media buyers to render and assess your fonts online, but if
    they abuse your trust, then do something about it.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    Web fonts are thriving in Korea at the moment. Cyworld, the popular Korean website
    that offered personal spaces on the web years before MySpace, is selling about
    25,000 web fonts a day, which amounts to 10 billion won (about 10 milion US dollars)
    in sales per year.\r\n\r\nUsers buy web fonts so they can personalize their \"mini
    homepages\", bulletin board and forum entries, and email messages on websites
    like Cyworld and other large network orportal sites. Web fonts are predominantly
    pixel fonts, and this has been a big part of their success in Korea. Because Korean
    fonts for print require hangul, with thousands of glyphs, they often require years
    of work and can be quite expensive. There is not much variety, either. But pixel
    fonts can be produced in a tiny fraction of the time, and thus hundreds of hangul
    web fonts have sprung up, produced by traditional type foundries as well as new
    outfits devoted to web fonts.\r\n\r\nI must confess I do not know much about this
    phenomenon, since my primary interest is in print typography. I've never bought
    a web font, and I'm not really interested in doing so.\r\n\r\nA few quick points...
    The Korean web environment is different from what you may be used to. Koreans
    are used to buying a lot of virtual items like personalized avatar elements and
    items needed for multi-user games. Also, many spend an inordinate amount of time
    on the large Korean websites that provide the web font services. Finally, none
    of these web fonts that I've seen are suitable for print, as the vast majority
    are pixel fonts, and even those that are not are heavily compromised for screen
    use.\r\n"

    let it roll. I have also helped uncover other kinds of piracy \u2014 those when
    a designer uses other font's outlines to create derivative fonts that he then
    tries to sell as his own. And of course I have experimented with font extraction
    from PDF or Flash documents \u2014 how else would I be able to advise any of my

    keep being told to be extra-nice to David Berlow, because (I am also immediately
    thereafter told) he\u2019s been \u201Cdoing this forever\u201D and none of the
    rest of us have. But his remark above is nonsense. It masquerades  as an expert\u2019s
    posing an intractable question none of the peons had managed to think of before.\r\n\r\nHTML
    elements have explicit or implied semantics. The most useful distinction, which,
    contradictorily, is intrinsically presentational, is the classification of elements
    as either <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#q5\">block-level</a>;
    <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#q7\">inline</a>; or, for
    a rare subset of elements (<code>iframe</code>, <code>del</code>, <code>ins</code>),
    either. Block-level elements act like paragraphs (notionally, with a carriage
    return before and after) and inline elements fit inside lines.\r\n\r\nThese categories
    are, however, overridable with CSS, as via <code>display: inline</code> and <code>display:
    block</code>. (That\u2019s how standards-compliant Web pages style navbars \u2013
    unordered lists, a block-level element \u2013 as nice little rows of words you
    can click.)\r\n\r\nNow, in principle every single element in HTML can be styled
    in other ways, and the other ways germane to this discussion involve font, size,
    leading, and foreground and background colour. Indention can be styled for some
    elements. A small number of elements are hard to style  (<code>abbr</code>/<code>acronym</code>,
    <code>q</code>, <code>button</code>, <code>fieldset</code>/<code>legend</code>),
    but those are due to browser bugs, not flaws in the spec.\r\n\r\nIn short, then,
    dberlow, the answer to your question is as follows: The dividing line is <em>right
    where we\u2019ve been telling you it is all along</em>, between HTML (structure)
    and CSS (presentation).\r\n\r\nPurely presentational elements (not a misprint)
    like <code>font</code> and <code>center</code> simply aren\u2019t used in standards-compliant
    authoring. An additional grey area comes up with other purely presentational elements,
    namely <code>b</code>/<code>i</code>/<code>u</code>, whose application in the
    context of Web standards used to be debated quite a bit. Now people know that
    you can use those elements if you are, for example, transcribing a(n) historical
    text that uses bold, italics, or underline in a way that other elements, like
    <code>cite</code>, <code>em</code>, or <code>strong</code>, cannot capture. These
    borderline edge cases do not vitiate the explicit principle, at work every minute
    of the day on the Web and easily learned by Googling or reading any of a dozen
    books, that HTML marks up page structure and CSS specifies appearance. This is
    noncontroversial and it\u2019s tiresome to have to beat this dead horse.\r\n\r\n\u2014

    don't think web documents should hold any typographic or presentational information.
    Instead they should link to style sheets that can be reused and cached. The web

    your question. Does your 'where' refer to where in the document? Style sheets
    languages offer selectors with high enough specificity to address single elements
    (e.g., #foo in CSS). So, you can create highly customized presentation while maintaining
    the separation of content and presentation."

    That proposal is not, in my opinion, complete to the task at hand and as the OS'

    if required, with all the options in between available, if required (ye olde and
    new combination outline bitmap stoke font for the user with 4 screens on one desk).

    because the users' PCs have a massive computing power at their disposal, so they
    can deal with rasterization, scaling, resolution adjustments etc. -- while if
    you offload all those tasks to the servers, every content vendor will have to
    invest in massive server and bandwidth technology, and this technology will become
    usable for rich content vendors only. \r\n\r\nWhat you're proposing is similar
    to \"soft ripping\" in prepress times -- the computer would rasterize a document
    and send a finite bitmap down to the imagesetter, which would then slavishly render
    the dots. But the industry chose PostScript/PDF, where it would be the receiving
    devices that would have an intelligent driver that transforms a common interchange
    format (PostScript, later PDF) into the rasterized image, while the sending part
    would take care of generating that common code. \r\n\r\nThe web works similarly
    now: the sending part (the server) formats the content into an interchange form
    (HTML+CSS+PNG/GIF/JPG+(soon)TTF) while the receiver (a browser) is an intelligent

    CSS cannot apply styles to characters, only to elements. So, we need to find property
    values that can be applied to the whole element without causing unwanted side
    effects.\r\n\r\nI assume this code:\r\n<code>\r\np { font-variant-storey: single
    }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nwould be too general as it would apply to 'g' as well. Another
    option would be to introduce the functional notation which is used for some values:\r\n<code>\r\np
    { font-variant-storey: single(a) double(g) }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIn order to justify
    the cost it would be to introduce, specify, implement and test this feature we
    need to learn more about multi-storey characters. How many characters come in
    multi-storey varieties? In cyrillic? Other scripts? How do fonts label these alternates?
    How consistent is the labelling? Do font APIs offer this information to applications?
    Across all platforms?"

    referencing the font file, as suggested earlier by Mr Lie,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@font-face
    {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src: url(http://www.example.com/thesis-smallcaps-whatever);\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    additional properties which in combination identify this font\r\n\r\nbecause:
    If you got a bunch of PST1 fonts which make stylistic alternate glyphs available
    in separate fonts (= styles), and if these separate fonts are identified by strings/abbreviations
    in the fonts' file name and menu names, and if the latter strings/abbreviation
    moreover are foundry-specific -- how please should CSS be able to identify the
    correct font by just looking for \"two storey g\" in any font variant?\r\nLet's
    assume that CSS would support the 20 Stylistic Set features, it would not know
    more about them than their names: \"Stylistic Set 1\", \"3\", \"6\" etc. Neither
    applications nor CSS can know what each does. Alternate g is of that category.
    Unless there's a registered feature dedicated to one- or two-storey a's and g's,
    your example is a bit unrealistic. I think you expect more from CSS than even
    OT specs offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)"

    down to the exact x, y, and d of the type, kerning, tracking, alternates, ligatures,

    with something like your single-storey \u0251 use case is that this kind of variant
    is very much font-specific and always has been, and even if one were to construct
    a general mechanism for 'storey variants', as H\xE5kon imagines above, one is
    still going to be left with dozens of other kinds of design-specific variants
    that fall between the cracks of such a mechanism, that do not correspond to an
    anticipated variant class and specified property. In typography as in linguistics
    there are 'free variables', and these basically require the equivalent of that
    earliest of typesetting technologies: the case of individual sorts from which
    the typesetter can grab the appropriate form and insert it in the composing stick.
    Adobe's glyph palette is the most direct equivalent, but OpenType stylistic alternate
    layout features are only one level above this and not much easier to address in
    terms of cross-font behaviour and, hence, generalised mark-up."

  body: "> <em>My tentative conclusion from our discussions is that referencing fonts
    in CSS is not \xABfundamentally broken\xBB</em>\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas used the expression
    \xABfundamentally broken\xBB I think what he had in mind was that with CSS it's
    easy to reference a font that is part of a small family (e.g. <code>font-family:
    Arial; font-style: italic;</code> will get you <em>Arial Italic</em>), but when
    the font family has more than the usual 4 styles (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold
    Italic), like Minion Pro or Myriad Pro for example, then referencing a specific
    font is no longer easy. And it gets even more complicated when you try to find
    a solution that works for all the browsers. Here's an example:\r\n\r\nTo reference
    <em>Minion Pro Bold Italic</em>, one would probably use the following code, right?\r\n<code>font-family:
    'Minion Pro';\r\nfont-weight: bold;\r\nfont-style: italic;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIf
    yes, then why do Safari and Firefox display different fonts, like so?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/css_1_6546.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    things can get even more interesting. If one wants to reference <em>Minion Pro
    Medium Cond(ensed) Italic Display</em> this is the code you'll have to use for
    Safari,\r\n<code>font-family: 'MinionPro-MediumCnItDisp';\r\nfont-style: italic;</code>\r\n\r\nand
    this is the code you'll have to use for Firefox,\r\n<code>font-family: 'Minion
    Pro Med Cond Disp';\r\nfont-style: italic;</code>\r\n\r\nin order to get this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/css_2_4815.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't agree that's broken, then why am I getting different results for the
    same code, and why do I have to use different code to get the same results? Sure,
    you can blame the browsers for not be doing the right thing, BUT <strong>what
    is the \"right thing\"?</strong> Which name strings in the font are the browsers
    supposed to use? Should they just pick-and-choose Name IDs (http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm)
    as desired, or should the CSS spec give a clear guidance?\r\n\r\nAnd in the example
    that tries to reference <em>Minion Pro Medium Cond(ensed) Italic Display</em>
    shouldn't the code be a lot more straight forward? Something like this, perhaps:\r\n<code>font-family:
    'Minion Pro';\r\nfont-style: 'Medium Cond Italic Display';</code>\r\n\r\n> <em>[...]
    new variants in OpenType font warrants some new keywords on the \u2019font-variant\u2019
    property [...] but the exact list of keywords can\u2019t be determined quite yet;
    it will depend on availability of fonts</em>\r\n\r\nIf by 'fonts' you mean 'free
    fonts', then that last sentence will be closer to the truth...\r\nFonts with OpenType
    layout features *ARE* available, and the keywords *CAN* be determined. The keywords
    can be based on the features already registered (http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featurelist.htm),
    and there are already hundreds of fonts that implement a lot of these features
    (e.g. Minion Pro, Myriad Pro, the ClearType collection, Palatino Linotype [in
    Win2000 and up], etc.). This thread has several examples of fonts with OT features:

    getting an unique and clear pointer to a given font on that list. Yes, it's up
    to the systems to implement the APIs, but on the other hand it's up to CSS to
    clearly say what 'font-family' corresponds to. Is it NameID#1 or NameID#16? If
    NameID#1, then what should be done in case the family has more than 4 styles?\r\n\r\nAs
    Thomas said, section 15.4.2 Full font name (http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#aname)
    only scratches the surface on this matter. There needs to be a clearer guidance

    OT spec gives absolutely no guidance on this matter. It only describes what each
    name string is. It doesn't say which names or how many names should be used to
    get an exact (cross-platform & cross-browser) reference to a font. For example,
    some Adobe applications use NameID#6 in the documents they generate in order to
    have an unambiguous cross-platform reference to a font, while other apps use other

    nothing stopping the W3C to specify the keywords now. Or are you waiting for each
    browser to come up with their own solution and then blame them for not following
    the spec (that was written *after* the fact)?\r\n\r\nOpenType is here to stay,
    either you want it or not. The sooner CSS embraces it, the better for everyone.
    XAML already has http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745109.aspx Now, shouldn't

    If the current requirements do not address a specific and isolated issue, why
    not address it?\r\n\r\nAn added benefit of so doing would be a further standardization
    of naming conventions for Open Type fonts. If all of the foundries know that the
    CSS spec will call for NameID#6, then all of the foundries will then make darn
    sure that the NameID#6 string is fully mapped out.\r\n\r\nAs the subject was originally
    about CSS specifying server-end fonts, the web designer/programmer will have access
    to the font files and access to all of the specific name ids associated with them.
    They could very easily find out exactly what the NameID#6 string is EXACTLY, then
    spec it up without worry.\r\n\r\nThe cascade could call for a specified font via
    the standardized name id, then fall back to a standard web font if some freak
    occurrence prevents the specified font from downloading and activating on the
    user end.\r\n\r\nI like that idea, because I don't like having to string together
    an entire set of font properties that are already inherent in a font. Why call
    for Myriad Pro, but only the condensed version that happens to be an italic variant
    and only if it's the display weight instead of the file Myriad Pro Condensed Italic
    Display?\r\n\r\nFor a Word user, it might make sense. But we as Typophiles understand
    that every variant is a font in and of itself, not a magically bolder and slantier

    Caption</code>\r\n\r\nAnd MinionPro-BoldIt.otf outputs as,\r\n<code>Minion Pro:style=Bold
    Italic</code>\r\nbut by the format above it would have been,\r\n<code>Minion Pro,(font
    has no MSNameID16),Minion Pro:style=Bold Italic,(font has no MSNameID17),Bold
    Italic</code>\r\n\r\n> <em>Which font should be selected?</em>\r\n\r\nCurrently,
    the answer varies from browser to browser. I'd say that those properties define
    \"Minion Pro Bold Italic Condensed\". The problem with CSS is that it's build
    on the assumption that fonts in a family only vary by Weight, Width and Slope,
    which is true for most families but certainly not all. What about fonts that differ
    only by Optical Size? (Two fonts can have the same WWS, but one is designed to
    be used at large point sizes --Display--, and the other at small point sizes --Caption).
    And what about two fonts of the same family that only vary in design? (e.g. Shelley
    Allegro, Shelley Andante and Shelley Volante). CSS goes a step further than Windows,
    which differentiates fonts only by Weight (Regular, Bold) and Slope (Upright,
    Italic), but still falls short of what is necessary for describing a font by its
    properties.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, CSS tries to address two different things with
    the same set of properties. On one hand, the properties have to be as specific
    as possible so that the desired font(s) get selected. To achieve that we'd only
    need two properties,\r\n<code>nameOfFontFamily: \"Minion Pro\";\r\nnameOfStyleInFontFamily:
    \"Bold Italic Condensed Caption\"</code>\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, the font
    needs to be described by a set of general properties/characteristics so that,
    in case the desired font is not available, there's at least enough information
    to find a close match.\r\n\r\nSo, the main challenge is probably deciding where
    one of the operations ends and the other starts, i.e. when should browsers stop
    trying to find the font that equals the specified properties, and start guessing
    which font would be the better match.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would like to be able
    to spec my font(s) in a typographic manner like I do in InDesign. That said, it
    would be great if CSS could provided two additional properties,\r\n<code>font-typographicfamily:
    MacNameID1/MSNameID16\r\nfont-typographicstyle: MacNameID2/MSNameID17</code>\r\n\r\nBut
    I understand that is important to provide general properties to describe the font(s);
    this way browsers don't have to apply heuristics to two name strings in order
    to find if the font is Bold, Italic or Condensed. Is it possible to combine the
    two approaches? I think so.\r\n\r\nBTW, I experimented writing the CSS code for
    a few font families, based on my proposal from January 30th, and was quite surprised
    by the results I got in Firefox. About 85% of the fonts were selected and displayed
    correctly. One of the families, Kepler Std, was particularly interesting, since
    it has no less than 168 fonts!!\r\nThe results can be found at http://adhesiontext.com/typophile/CSSFontTest/\r\n\r\nI
    must say the results in Safari were very disappointing. This browser seems to
    prefer the PostScriptName (Mac&MS NameID6), but even with such specific pointer
    to the font(s), it failed to correctly display many of them. Some of which it
    couldn't even find. Perhaps there's something broken in the font matching mechanism."

    2.0.0.11 Mac. You can see it at http://adhesiontext.com/typophile/CSSFontTest/Firefox/MinionPro/

    size should not be seen as a variant in the same category as Small Caps or Ligatures.
    (Yes, there's the 'size' OpenType feature which is to be used for controlling
    the Optical size, but that feature has an unique format and it looks like it was
    shoehorned into the GPOS table)\r\nI see the Optical size as a font property at
    the same level as the font's Weight, Width or Slope, and therefore it ought to
    have its own keyword, e.g.\r\n<code>font-opticalsize: 6pt;</code>\r\n\r\nThe other
    thing to consider is that, historically, the optical size is an integer value
    between 6 and 72 (points). Therefore, the optical size shouldn't be defined as
    a finite set of names such as Caption, Subhead or Display. That was Adobe's approach,
    but there's no reason to do it that way, on the contrary. This system of names
    was good for educating the users --and even so, the terms are not interpreted
    the same way by all the users--, but it becomes problematic when new sizes need
    to be introduced."
