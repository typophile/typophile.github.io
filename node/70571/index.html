  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys,
This font WTF Newstrike by Twice2 has got to be one of my all time favorite fonts.

http://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/d6/d61caa8c28a1fa2d38c3a58d3326fbf6.12266.jpeg

I don't know why but the techno, futuristic fonts have always just appealed to me.

I don't know wheather its because I thought the NASA logo was a cool look growing up in the 80's, along with the Terminator logo and also seeing a local car company using a similar sort of type face as newstrike on their cars as seen here (same sort of style was used in the early 90's (Holden) http://www4.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Hamilton+400+V8+Supercars+Practice+ULCxytBOkXol.jpg

but there is something about these and especially newstrike that has just always appealed to me, newstrike sort of reminds me of a futuristic/classiness. Does it for you? If so why is this so, what make it feel like that to me?

Anyone else out there know of any other fonts that are related to newstrike or portray a similar futuristic/complex/classiness feel?

Always interested to learn from those in the know, hopefully I might learn a bit also about why my brain is what it is!...

		<div class="commentbody">actually upon further examination and thinking about type and comparing this to other techno style fonts, newstrike the horizontal top and bottom part of the letters such as T, C, L, F, S etc are not as thick as the vertical parts of the letters, and the Y, W, M these letters are not reflection type letters (not the same both sides of the letter) you could call it, I guess what this means is the font is not as blocky, or plain, or easy or you call call it dumb even, as other techno ones that I see, prehaps that is the recipe that I like??? 

(As you can see I am not a type centered person, but are always eager to learn)</div>
