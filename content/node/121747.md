    \r\n\r\nIn the U.S. the Pantone system (pantone.com) is the most common color-matching
    system for printed materials that use solid-color inks. (Or CMYK for 4-color jobs,
    or RGB for web work.) Can you provide more info?"

  body: "Hi, thanks for replying JamesM.\r\nThe issue is that I had a slight mistake,
    try to correct it, but the \"EDIT\" button does not aparce on my panel.\r\n\r\nOk.
    so try to say is this:\r\n\r\n-ONE-\r\nDoes anyone know of any web site to generate
    precise combination color?\r\n(the point is that I would like it to be the web
    the most professional possible)\r\neg KULER, but a better place.\r\n\r\n-TWO-\r\nDoes
    anyone know any technique to generate a colors professionals or colors clean?\r\nie
    I've noticed that colors have a code either RGB or CYMK, but choose a random color
    in the spectrum I find something wrong,\r\nIs there a mathematical technique to
    obtain a professional tone color?\r\n\r\nExample in photoshop:\r\n1. Code chosen
    color palette by default PS\r\n     # 9e9e9e (Grey)\r\n\r\n2. Code chosen randomly\r\n
    \   # 9f9898 (Grey)\r\n    \r\nYou may notice that the first code has a order
    logic, while the second code is messy.\r\nIt is what I call \"\" color professional
    \"and\" color dirty \"\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me, Thanks!"

    one sees the code, they see the color. I tried both colors you mentioned in Photoshop
    and they looked fine (but slightly different). \r\n\r\n> Is there a mathematical
    technique to obtain \r\n> a professional tone color?\r\n\r\nThere are books, color
    wheels, and websites that offer advice if you need it, but it boils down to picking
    colors that look nice together. Keep in mind that color is subjective \u2014 there
    are some general principals for picking colors but different people have different
    preferences. \r\n\r\nAlso you need to choose colors that fit the subject. A children's
    publication might have bright colors, a serious medical publication might have
    very muted colors. And so forth.\r\n\r\nWhat are you trying to create? A website?
    A printed piece?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Plax, as James alluded, there's no such thing as professional colors. All
    colors are good; they just need to be used appropriately to get professional results.\r\n\r\nThe
    color spaces you mentioned, RGB (red, green & blue) and CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow
    & black), are common color spaces.\r\n\r\nWith RGB, red, green and blue light
    is combined to create colors. One hundred percent of each color creates white.
    Zero percent of each color creates black or the absence of any light. Varying
    combinations of percentages of red, green and blue light create a full spectrum
    of colors. Your computer monitor, smartphone screen and television set all use
    RGB.\r\n\r\nCMYK, on the other hand, is what's used in 4-color process printing.
    Varying the percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink (black is represented
    by the letter k),  creates all the various colors that CMYK is capable of making.
    The percentages of these colors are determined by the size of the small dots of
    ink printed on the paper. CMYK colors are typically specified in percentages.
    For example, 80% cyan, 100% magenta, 100% yellow, 18% black will produce a dark
    red. These percentages might commonly be written out as 80,100,100,18.\r\n\r\nRGB
    percentages require a bit more explanation. RGB is typically specified in hexidecimal,
    which uses sixteen base numbers instead of the usual ten (decimal) that most people
    are familiar with. In other words, there are six additional base numbers in hexidecimal,
    so counting goes like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f. The
    letters represent the additional numbers. The reasons for using a hexidecimal
    system instead of the more familiar decimal system has to do with the way that
    computers do calculations, which is a whole other subject. Since working with
    RGB is primarily done on a computer, it makes sense to specify RGB values in computer
    terms.\r\n\r\nWith that explanation out of the way, RGB colors are specified pretty
    much like CMYK colors are specified, except that it uses the hexidemical system.
    So that same dark red that I mentioned above, in which I used CMYK percentages,
    now roughly becomes 9b (red), 1f (green), 17 (blue), or as it's commonly written
    out, 9b1f17.\r\n\r\nThe RGB color you mentioned in your post was 9e9e9e. The numbers
    form a consistent pattern only because equal amounts of red, green and blue were
    specified, which produces a neutral grey. Changing the values just a bit to, say,
    9f9898 simply shifts the balance between RGB to produce an ever-so-slightly reddish
    gray. Similarly a very bright red would be produced by ff0000, which basically
    says spells out pure red, with no green or blue. Pure green would be specified
    as 00ff00. Different combinations of those hexidecimal values will produce pretty
    much all the different colors of the rainbow. None are more or less professional
    than the others \u2014 they're all just colors."

      you for your explanation as complete.\r\n\r\nNow I'm a little confused, do not
      know how to explain what I need,\r\n\r\n1. I agree with what you comment and
      your answer is correct,\r\n    but I think there's something more, that I can
      see something more than just colors.\r\n    maybe you have right when he says
      that \"need to be suitably used for professional           \r\n    results\"
      I agree with that.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I can best explain with the word \"COLORS
      FINE / COLORS WITH CLASS\"\r\nWhat happens when it comes to \"One color\" here
      there is no combination,\r\ntherefore the selection of a single color is very
      important, continue with the example of you red color.\r\nIs there a technique
      to define a color fine red?\r\n\r\nYou mention that depends on the occasion,
      speaking of a logo ...\r\nred for creche is very bright,\r\nwhile a red for
      a restaurant is a darker red\r\nThat is absolutely clear.\r\n\r\nbut both the
      bright and the dark will have two paths to your choice,\r\nlow class  and one
      with class, two for each.\r\n\r\nThat's the closest I can explain.\r\n\r\nThank
      you!"

    there's no such thing as \"professional colors\".  \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for
    \"classy\" colors, then generally you want subtle colors (not bright or vivid),
    but it really depends on the situation. You might try looking at the websites
    or catalogs of companies that have the kind of style you're looking for.\r\n"

  body: "We seem to be having language barrier problems, so we might not be answering
    the question you are asking.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned colors that are \"fine\" and
    \"with class.\" Those are subjective words or words without precise definitions.
    When choosing colors, a designer often picks colors that have emotional qualities
    that speak to the viewer. For example, bright red is a loud, exciting and aggressive
    color. A dark red still speaks aggressively, but has a softer, relaxed and more
    comfortable feeling to it. Similarly, blues and greens are calming and cool.\r\n\r\nThere
    is no manual or formula for choosing the right colors for the occasion. Choosing
    colors and color schemes is often a matter of intuition and judgment. Sometimes
    colors are already chosen for a designer and must match already-existing company
    color schemes.\r\n\r\nAs James mentioned in his first post, in the U.S., the Pantone
    matching system is used most often to specify exact colors. Printed books are
    available that list all the Pantone colors, along with color swatches of each.
    Picking which one to use, however, is still a matter of intuition and judgment.
    Pantone does not tell you which color to pick; it simply lists all that are available
    in their system.\r\n\r\nMost designers also use the Adobe suite of graphics software.
    Adobe InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator all have similar color choosing features
    that show the colors and give the values in both CMYK and RGB. This suite of software
    also contains already-made color swatches that match most of the most popular
    color matching systems in the printing industry, including Pantone."
