  body: The variations on the first one lead me to believe that it's lettered, not
    typeset. So you won't be able to find a typeface just like it. I'm not sure about
    the second one's inconsistencies, whether they're because it's hand drawn or because
    it is the result of poor typeface design.

    second may have begun as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/algerian/?sample_text=THE%20WHARF&sample_size=60\">Algerian</a>."
