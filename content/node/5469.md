body: I&#39;m looking for a picture font collection that includes various skulls of
  this style. I came across it months ago, but cannot find it now. I only recall that
  it was from a site that offered a small selection of stylized collections which
  included this skull/biker/flame font set and some other military/tank/pixel type
  fonts.  <BR> <BR>Any idea where I can find this?! Any suggestions would be greatly
  appreciated!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39904.jpg" alt="skull">

  body: 'Wow. Thanks Joseph! That looks exactly like the sample I posted, and may
    be more useful than what I was initially looking for... <BR> <BR>FYI, that sample
    I posted was just a general style reference, since I couldn&#39;t find the specific
    collection I was seeking... which, in case anyone is interested, I found today
    in a ridiculously-roundabout way. It&#39;s called Flame n Skull by Apollo26: <BR>http://apollo26.com/deprogram.html

    better than the free  <BR>Skullz one. But fair enough, if the Dafont font suits  <BR>your
    needs, good for you. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
