  \ Deseret is a phonetic, non-Roman alphabet for writing English.  It has been encoded
  in [[Unicode]] for several years now, and the PDF sample shows the Unicode positions
  of the letters.  Deseret does not have separate characters for upper and lower case
  letters - they are distinguished by size only.  However, I have introduced some
  differences in the upper and lower case glyphs in keeping with the Times.  This
  is the fist serious font (with many more to come) I have developed for the Deseret
  Alphabet (or any other alphabet for that matter) and I would appreciate any comments.\r\n\r\nClick

    glyphs? Or are you going to use it on some greater project?\r\n\r\nI have always
    been curious about that time period. It seems there were several people interested
    in reforming the alphabet. Something in the air at the time I suppose."

    to post some kind of primer for the Deseret Alphabet otherwise I'm not sure how
    anyone will reference a character. Not like we're talking about Uppercase K's
    or lowercase b's.

  body: "Miss Tiffany,\r\n\r\nI have been working on this mostly out of a deep fascination
    for the Deseret Alphabet.  The Deseret Alphabet is a part of my heritage, but
    unfortunately it is virtually unknown by others who share that heritage.  I would
    simply like to see it become more widely known (and even used) by those who have
    a similar cultural heritage.  I don't have any specific application in mind.  I
    would like to see everything from poetry to personal correspondence written in
    Deseret. \r\n\r\nYou are quite right about the attempts to reform English orthography.
    \ There were several groups or individuals pushing for it in the 1800's, but language
    reform was not limited to the 19th century.  The Shavian Alphabet (another phonetic
    alphabet for English), for example, was developed in 1958.  \r\n\r\nKen,\r\n\r\nQuite
    right.  Click [[http://copper.chem.ucla.edu/~jericks/Deseret%20Alphabet%20Tables/The%20Cannonicaly-Ordered%20Deseret%20Alphabet.pdf|here]]

  body: "I guess the Deseret Alphabet is part of my heritage too.  Never really thought
    about it that way before.\r\n\r\nYou could learn a lot about early Utah English
    (or at least what was considered the prestige dialect in that time and place)
    from studying the Deseret Alphabet materials.  One thing that stands out to me
    from looking at the chart of letters is the presence of a vowel \"aw\" as in \"aught\"
    (which would correspond to IPA \u0254).  These days that vowel is a sort of shibboleth
    of American dialectology--and is absent from Utah English and other Western US
    dialects.\r\n\r\nIn terms of modern usage of the Alphabet, this raises an interesting
    question.  Two main goals of the Deseret Alphabet were to standardize spelling
    and to correspond closely to the phonology of the language.  Since the phonology
    of Utah English (as well as other dialects) has changed since that time, should
    a modern-day adopter of the Deseret Alphabet stay true to the 19th century spelling
    reforms and occasionally violate the phonetic correspondence, or write according
    to their modern phonetics at some expense to the spelling standard?\r\n\r\nGetting
    back to the font--I've never liked the way the Deseret Alphabet looked, but I
    have to say that your font seems like a big step toward modernizing it and making
    it attractive.  I really like the serifs.  One complaint is that U+1041B looks
    too much like a Latin capital L to me; the original alphabet seemed to go to some
    lengths to avoid that resemblance (although I don't care for the original one
    either).  I think that one and ones like it deserve some more attention.  The
    same can be said for U+10419 and its lower-case counterpart, which incorrectly
    look like the letter P.  The angle of the bowl is just plain wrong.  On the other
    hand, I don't mind so much a resemblance in letters that were clearly designed
    to reflect letters from the Latin alphabet, such as the letters that look like
    an O or the letter that looks like N.\r\n\r\nPlease don't take the criticism badly.
    \ It's interesting to see a \"Mormon pioneer\" font and I look forward to following
    its development."

    was considered the prestige dialect in that time and place) from studying the
    Deseret Alphabet materials.\"</em>\r\n\r\nYes you could learn a lot, but only
    from the letters, journals, and newspaper articles written in it.  Some research
    done by Ken Beeseley indicates that the books that were printed, or prepared for
    printing, probably followed the pronunciations given in Websters Dictionary.\r\n\r\n<em>\"should
    a modern-day adopter of the Deseret Alphabet stay true to the 19th century spelling
    reforms and occasionally violate the phonetic correspondence, or write according
    to their modern phonetics at some expense to the spelling standard?\r\n\"</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    is an interesting question.  I think there is a balance that needs to be struck.
    In the first Deseret News articles that are written in the Deseret Alphabet there
    is included a brief explanatory paragraph before the actual Deseret text.  In
    this explanation it is stated: \r\n\r\n    \"We present to the people the Deseret
    Alphabet, but have not adopted any rules to bind the taste, judgment or preference
    of any.  Such as it is you have it, and we are sanguine that the more it is practised
    and the more intimately the people become acquainted with it the more useful and
    beneficial it will appear.\r\n    The characters are designed to represent the
    sounds for which they stand, and are so used.  Where one stands alone, the name
    of the character or letter is the word it being the only sound heard.  We make
    no classification into vowels, consonants, &c., considering that to be of little
    or no consequence; the student is therefore at liberty to deem all the characters
    vowels or consonants or starters or stoppers or whatever else he pleases. \r\n
    \   In the orthography of the published examples, Webster's pronunciation will
    be generally followed, though it will be varied from when general usage demands.
    \ All words having the same pronunciation will be spelled alike, and the reader
    will have to depend upon the context for the meaning of such words...\"\r\n    \r\n
    \   It seems that the rules were intended to be rather loose; however, the newspaper
    used Webster's dictionary as a guide, but even then they varied the spellings
    according to the local dialect.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the comments on the font.
    \ Those are the kind of comments I was originally after.  I'm not sure what could
    be done with U+1041B (the letter ehthh).  The original letter looks like a Latin
    capitol L.  However, I could see changing the bowl angle on U+10419 (the letter
    ehf). "

  body: The historical info is fascinating.  There's some wisdom in not dividing things
    into consonants and vowels, etc. since it presents a somewhat false dichotomy
    of how phonetics works.  Thanks for sharing this.

  body: "My first thought when looking at this alphabet:\r\n\r\nWhoever invented the
    original Deseret alphabet glyphs should have looked at Hoefler's type 110 class
    here on typophile ( http://typophile.com/courses/type110 ). I understand of course
    that Mr. Hoefler arrived to late to help Deseret, but it does suffer from lack
    of unity and practicality in many of the fanciful shapes. And while the exercise
    would be purely academic, it would be interesting to try and use the alphabet
    as a starting point for the assignment in Hoefler's lesson.\r\n\r\nStill it will
    probably help you Joshua, to look at it for your Times adaptation.\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/times_des_6354.gif]\r\n\r\nGlyphs circled
    in green suffer from color issues. They are generally too dark, or at risk of
    becoming so. Sometimes it's caused by overlaps that mass dark areas, othertimes
    it's just too much stuff happening. These are the shapes that I would characterize
    as too fanciful. They look like letters someone invented in one sitting verses
    letters with roots in writing that developed over a long time with efficiency
    as a motivator.\r\n\r\nGlyphs circled in red suffer from spacing and balance issues.
    In latin type, there are some letters that cause spacing problems P, L, T , r,
    etc, but for the most part latin letters set up a nice rythm. In Hoefler's lesson
    these shapes would be modified because the white and black areas would be out
    of balance. Also on the bottom, the \"reverse N with raised left side\" glyph
    :-) shows very poor balance. One of the things latin letter strive to do is fit
    inside a trapazoid with wider base than top. This allows them to rest on the baseline
    and feel stable. This is why the top loop of a B is smaller, why the top of an
    S doesn't stick out as far as the bottom, why the top bar of and E is shorter
    than the bottom. Some instability is fine, but this alphabet is rife with unstable
    characters.\r\n\r\nThe purple reversed N shows what the stress would look like
    if and N was redrawn in reverse, not merely flipped. Interesting that the lowercase
    version of the same glyph has \"correct\" stress.\r\n\r\nFinally, the terminals
    on the strokes seems arbitrary in some places. On the slash 8 (second to last
    line) why a serif in one, and a ball terminal in the other? This difference between
    lower and upper is all over the alphabet, but missing in the Ss Flipped Jj etc.\r\n\r\nOne
    last note: I'm framing my thoughts by relating this alphabet to priciples from
    the latin alphabet. Partly because this borrows heavily from it. But it also has
    elements of greek and cyrillic.\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "Thank you for your very insightful comments Randy.  Some of the arbitrary
    stress and terminals comes simply from trying to fit the Deseret Alphabet into
    the Times New Roman motif.  For example, in Times New Roman both J and j have
    lower ball terminals while S and s have serif terminals.  However, I see what
    you mean, and I will have to take another look at the differences between cases.\r\ncheers,\r\nJoshua"
