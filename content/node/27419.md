  with Fontlab, then I\u2019ve passed it through microsoft volt. End result, I have
  a truetype font that works perfectly on PC but not on mac. Does anyone have an idea
  how to make it work on mac please? I\u2019ve read that arabic opentype fonts work
  perfectly with Adobe MEA, is it only text edit who is unable to combine the arabic
  letters? I really need help and I\u2019ll be most greatful. Naji"

  body: "naji,\r\n\r\ni suppose you are testing your font on mac osx. unfortunately
    osx relies on aat tables to render arabic on the system level. opentye support
    only exists (and even that is poor) for latin and japanese.\r\n\r\nhowever, this
    applies only to system applications - textedit and safari for example. in fact
    i don't know of other applications which support aat - presumably that's the reason
    no one but apple uses this technology.\r\nyour fonts should be fine in adobe me
    applications on mac."

    your font should work in Apple OS services (Adobe rolls it''s own OT support to
    ensure cross-platform loveliness). Apple is publicly committed to OT, but they''re
    not currently doing OpenType shaping engines that will support complex script
    languages.  '

  body: "Titus, \r\nIn deed I actually tested it in text edit on osx and as you know
    it didn't work. I haven't tested it yet in Adobe me cause I don't have it yet.
    I tried in the same time to test it in illustrator cs (pc), and while opening
    the font in the glyphs, just to preview it, illustrator crushed down. To be more
    honest, I'm doing it for a client (a TV channel) who wants a fully functional
    font on both platforms mac & pc... I wonder if there is a software (the equivalent
    of volt) on mac that could do the job. Thanks for your help guys anyway.  "

  body: "naji,\r\n\r\nAFAIK you can have opentype and aat tables in the same font
    if you really want to support arabic rendering on a system level on both platforms.\r\nhowever,
    i have no idea about the extra workload this involves.\r\n\r\nthe illustrator
    crash could have many reasons. but generally you should be able to insert every
    glyph through the glyph palette - i've used this with arabic in illustrator cs2.
    you don't get correct rendering, but have to choose the appropriate form of your
    letter manually.\r\n\r\nyou can find tools for aat on the mac homepage:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/textfonts/Tools/index.html"

    as since Apple started implementing OpenType support the two will conflict if
    both are present. Use seperate OT/AAT font files to get around this.\r\n\r\n2)
    I'm pretty good at all this AAT malarky. And unemployed. If you want to hire me
    I'd be most grateful :-)\r\nAs an example, I created the only free AAT fonts for
    the Brahmic Kannada and Telugu scripts of southern India: <a href=\"http://web.nickshanks.com/typography/kannada/\">nickshanks.com/typography/kannada</a>
    & <a href=\"http://web.nickshanks.com/typography/telugu/\">/telugu</a>\r\nThese
    use complex shaping rules (GPL-licensed code on web page) quite like arabic uses."

    think this is true - but Apple was on the record that they are going to fix this.
    Apple's Daniel (can't recall his last name, Fenwick maybe?) at ATypI Helsinki
    talked about this.\r\n\r\nSi  "

    was the case for Mac OS X 10.4.0-10.4.3. In Mac OS X 10.4.4, Apple fixed the problem.
    Now, when OTL and AAT tables are present in one font, the AAT tables have priority.
