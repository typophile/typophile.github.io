body: I'm looking for an alternative to Sackers, ideally something a little more elegant
  or feminine but with a similarly classy authority - think Marc Jacobs logo.  It'll
  be used in a logotype with no curved letters, in fact only V,Y,L,E, I and N and
  all caps.  Trade Gothic Extended is one but just wondering if anybody knew of any
  others to try out.

    see what I mean) but Neutraface might work too.
