  body: Comic Pro has been around for a while (1999) and it's a much better emulation
    of comic strip lettering than Microsoft's eyesore. Give it a closer look.

    Rugby Federation and the UNFP, promoting rugby fans supporting feeding the poor
    in Africa.  \r\n\r\nVery strange, but comforting in its own way....  ;-)"

    with Comic Sans, I guess, except that it's ugly and overused.

  body: Yes, Comic Pro is actually what it claims to be, a comic book style lettering
    font. Comic Sans is horrendous for many reasons, including that people think it
    is a "handwriting" font when it isn't, and that some people think it looks like
    a comic book lettering font, which it doesn't. There's basically no place where
    Comic Sans actually makes sense to use.
