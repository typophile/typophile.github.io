body: "I have invented a design brief for the font I am to design this fall. It is
  intended as a kind of composite of the characters, features, and applications of
  some of the prominent humanist sans faces of the 20th century, synopsized in [[http://www.typophile.com/node/48663|this
  blog entry]]. So I am \"commissioning\" myself to come up with a font that fulfills
  these intentions:\r\n\r\nREQUIRED FEATURES:\r\na) - no serifs\r\nb) - low or very
  low contrast (experienced as monoline or close to it)\r\nc) - upright\r\nd) - readable
  enough to be suitable for middling-length texts (e.g. captions, sidebars, pullquotes
  and other blurbs)\r\ne) - workable in sizes 11-36 point\r\nf) - neutral in character
  enough to be suitable for a wide variety of texts (without a strong impression of
  a particular time, place, or emotion)\r\ng) - strikes a balance between constructed
  and written forms\r\n\r\na), b), and c) simply set this out as a typical sans font.\r\n\r\ng),
  of course, is where the creative challenge begins - what features will help the
  font maintain crisp regularity, and which will give it human warmth? \r\n\r\nAnd
  d), e), and f) are the constraints which will focus the design. I suppose the positive
  approach would be to see d), e), and f) as helpful factors that will guide suitable
  answers to the big g) challenge. "
