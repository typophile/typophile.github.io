  designed the shape of the credit card? And why is it exactly this shape that became
  almost the omnipresent, universal type of card?</em>\r\n\r\nI know, that it's shape
  is standardized by the norm ISO/IEC 7810. I also know, that the shape is pretty
  similar to the size of business cards in certain countries. So maybe, the shape
  was adopted by the already common medium. But that would lead to the question, why
  the business card is shaped the way it is. But maybe I'm going the wrong direction
  here.\r\n\r\nI thought this forum might be a good place to search for answers. Any
  ideas?"

    if you look at the length and height of it, (84mm x 54mm) you will notice that
    the proportion of length to width is 1.59, which is incredibly close to the Golden
    Ratio (1.61803399).\r\n\r\nAnd the corners of credit and bank cards are rounded
    so they are less likely to bend or get stuck in an ATM.\r\n"

  body: "My guess is that the standard credit card size was based on size of business
    cards, which derived from the size of Victorian calling cards. There's an interesting
    article about calling cards at http://www.paperpenalia.com/cards.html\r\n\r\n\"By
    Victorian days, a tightly structured hierarchy of card size...was used...The largest
    cards, measuring 3 3/8\" x 2 1/2\", were reserved for married couples. A man could
    choose a card of either 3 3/8\" x 1.5\" or 3.5\" x 2\" dimensions. Sizes then
    ranged down to that for a married woman, a single woman, an unarried daughter
    still living at home, and a child, who had the smallest card at 2.25\" x 1 3/8\"...\"\r\n\r\n>
    The shape of business cards in the U.S. was dictated, \r\n> in part, by the typical
    dimensions of card stock...\r\n\r\nInteresting, but if there is a connection between
    card size and paper size, I wonder if the connection might be the reverse \u2014
    that stock was made to that size because it worked well when printing the most
    popular card size."

  body: "As to the chicken-and-egg question of card sizes, since today's 3 1/2\" by
    2\" size was one of the Victorian alternatives, the first place I would look for
    an explanation would be at the standard sizes of paper stock.\r\n\r\nThus, the
    standard 8 1/2\" by 11\" page size derives from (American) Demy Quarto/4to.\r\n\r\nBut
    someone already noted that it derives from an American size of paper stock instead
    of a British one, so I'm puzzled.\r\n\r\nAs to the credit card, the ISO/IEC standard
    gives it as 85.6 by 53.98 millimetres, which is close to 3.37 by 2 1/8 inches.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It is, indeed the business card format... back in the 1950's, when Bank of
    America in San Francisco, began to notice that merchants were essentially acting
    as banks when the merchants managed substantial "lay away" payment programs, and
    in an effort to compete against this, BoA initially gave "chits", literally typed
    with hand written signature pieces of paper, to their more trusted clients so
    they could go to to specific merchants for "credit purchases"... then it was just
    a matter of experimentation to formalize and standardize these "chits" into familiar
    and convenient "cards" that would be easy for anyone to carry around.

    It should have been 85.60 by 53.98 mm, which is 3 3/8\" by 2 1/8\".\r\n\r\nThe
    Charg-a-Plate was 2 1/2\" by 1 1/4\", the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card|same
    Wikipedia article]] notes.\r\n\r\nA business card, in the U.S. at least, is slightly
    smaller, at 3 1/2\" by 2\".\r\n\r\nThere is no traditional paper size that is
    either 8\" by 14\" or 14\" by 16\". There's 8\" by 10\" and 8 1/2\" by 14\". And
    there's Large Post at 16 1/2\" by 21\" if one wants to go duodecimo... or, rather,
    48mo.\r\n\r\nHowever, the credit card's size <strong>is</strong> neatly related
    to Foolscap, at 17\" by 13 1/2\"; 17\" is 2 1/8\" times eight, and 13 1/2\" is
    3 3/8\" times four."

    true, and I suspect the reason that came to be is that the credit card companies
    needed to make their cards fit into the already existing slots and holders in
    wallets and purses that were already filled by business cards, driver licenses,
    ID cards, Social Security Cards, wallet photos, etc. How that size came to be
    the standard in, at least, North America, I don't have a clue."
