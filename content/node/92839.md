body: "There does seem to be a common understanding of what \"block letters\" are,
  but no common, explicit, definition. Lowercase? Serifs?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  roughly how long the term has been in use? I am curious how the term has evolved
  in the US."

  body: I think "Block Capitals" is a more common term, and it's been around for as
    long as there have been "forms", so they would likely originate around 3000 BC
    in south west Mesopotamia.

  body: Perhaps there has been a conflation, and often what is meant by "Block Letters"
    is, in fact, "Block Capitals." I just wish that when the State of Massachusetts
    mandates them, I knew what they were talking about.

  body: 'Block Letters is also a style of lettering (pen & brush) that just means
    a plain sans serif letter (unburdened by the grot/human/geo classifications of
    type). '

  body: 'Perhaps, but a cursory browsing through Google books seems to show that after
    the 1840s the term "wood-block letters" becomes shortened to "block letters,"
    and is distinct from "gothic letters;" the block type usually having angles restricted
    to the octagonal, and the gothic being fully realized sans-serif. There doesn''t
    seem to be any consistent restriction of block letters to capitals until shortly
    after the turn of the century, and primarily in technical drawing alphabets. And
    by then the distinction between the block and the gothic is becoming blurred.  '

    end up giving them something like Rockwell extra bold, a slab serif, and yes,
    always in all capital letters.  The customers seem happy.\r\n\r\nI thought the
    term \"block\" derived from the slabs themselves actually, i.e., block fonts =
    slab serif fonts, though I could be quite wrong."

  body: Ryan - it seems that the term "block" originally derived directly from the
    wood they were carved from, though by the end of the 19th century the name is
    ascribed to the method of composing the letter forms from grids made of "blocks."

  body: "At the risk of beating horses already passed, a little more digging has found
    that as of the 1830s the term is applied to letter forms that have been produced
    in some form of relief, whether in iron, marble or cut from a wooden block. The
    term \"block\" seems to have, therefore, derived from the letters having an actual
    three-dimensional form.\r\n\r\nmakes sense.\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.com/books?id=qrhHAQAAIAAJ&dq=%22block%20letters%22&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q=%22block%20letters%22&f=false|The
