  body: "Like I said (on Flickr) what is seen depends most of all on the viewer!  ;-)\r\nJust
    teasing, James. I think any normal human will see something... sensual first (pardon
    the pun).\r\n\r\nBTW, check out my nascent set - I've decided to go all the way,

  body: "This is more complex and richer than finger smears (which don't evoke that
    much). For one thing, it generates depth. Also, you have to time it with the scanner's
    movement*; and you can't have upstrokes for example. It takes a lot of skill -
    as you can see with that \"R\" it's pretty hard to get good results... So I've
    removed the Flickr set (the two photos are still there though) until I can take
    a class in dedography to improve my skills.  ;-)\r\n\r\n* It might seem artificial
    for the results to depend so much on\r\na \"tool\", but it's the same with using
    a broad-nib pen for example.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
