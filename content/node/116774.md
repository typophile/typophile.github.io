  body: Thanks for the suggestion! I was already thinking about Franklin too, and
    News looks very decent as well. The problem relies a lot around that different
    kind of "a" (I don't know how it's called). It gives the Brown type a "Futura/retro"
    feel. Also, I don't want to use futura as I have been using it waaay too much
    in my recent projects...

    Brown.

  body: So Hrant, have you ever really looked at Franklin Gothic and News Gothic -
    feel is different than same as, and may be a more personal response.

  body: Thank's a lot guys. Proxima nova seems nice. But, I'll have to find out if
    the alternative "a" can bet set in a web font context. Hmmmm, something tells
    me you can't...
