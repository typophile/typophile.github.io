    body: "Thank you Norbert Florendo for your welcome and support words.  \r\nI take
      two years of investigation with the Before Columbus Cultures and I won the competition
      among 12 Latin American countries.  \r\nThe justification and defense that she/he
      played me to sustain openly in Rosario, Argentina is in the page.  \r\nThe corresponding
      typography that I call it VIDALADI is also.  \r\nIn this site, there will always
      be a space for you.\r\n\r\nA hug,\r\nVidal Design  \r\n  \r\nEcuador en la mitad

      of countries of different continents to have a global perspective of the design
      \ \r\nand to revert this experience of to share and to acquire knowledge to
      my students.  \r\n  \r\nI participate in competitions of Rumania, Germany, Ireland,
      France, Italy, among other...  \r\n  \r\nI memorizes very much.  \r\nMy teacher
