  that I need and admiring the knowledge of so many. Since I need some expert help,
  I decided to \r\n\r\nI am a particular fan of John Baskerville's font. I prefer
  the original Baskerville font over other variants, such as Fry's Baskerville and
  Mrs. Eaves. There is something about the Q glyph, for me, that is just beautiful.\r\n\r\nI
  also have absolutely no qualms about paying for a modern re-creation of Baskerville.
  There are tons of options out there, though I am particularly fond of ITC New Baskerville
  Cyrillic (though it is a bit thin...it's still very good). I haven't dropped the
  $ for New Baskerville FS (by the FontSite foundry)...but it looks to be a very well
  done version of the original Baskerville.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am working on a role playing
  game ruleset that I intend to publish for free digital download. I want to maintain
  minor control over the layout and typography of published works that utilize this
  ruleset (since the rules will be open and I encourage writers to create their own
  adventures that are compatible with the ruleset). Since it is my desire that published
  works follow a standardized template, I need a set of fonts that can be distributed
  openly. I have found several which can be used for headings and such, however, the
  font that I would like to use for the main text is Baskerville.\r\n\r\nI have searched
  high and low, and I cannot find a version of the Baskerville font that is free (aside
  from OpenBaskerville...which isn't complete).\r\n\r\nSo, I am looking for an alternative
  to Baskerville that is can be distributed and use with little to no restrictions.\r\n\r\nI
  have already looked at Gentium, which I really like, but it's not Baskerville ;)
  I have also looked at Day Roman...but I didn't find an italic version of it. I have
  also found SerifBeta (by the Betatype foundry...i.e. Christian Robertson's fonts).
  I really like SerifBeta, however it is still in \"beta\" format and I am not sure
  it will be free when Christian finishes it.\r\n\r\nThe font must be a Serif font,
  it must also have an italic version (not oblique). I would also prefer to have a
  bold (with corresponding italic), but it isn't a requirement. It also must be free
  for commercial use. \r\n\r\nSo, font experts, what are my options?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your recommendations!!!"

    the <em>alphabet</em> is bold italic in both, but the ampersand is correctly bold
    but not italicized in the bold.

    I found that one could at least access (as a separate typeface) the Baskervald
    Heavy. But that is, as your illustration shows, much bolder than the bold, which
    I can't even past into a WordPad document from an Open Office document.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    while encoding problems (usually related to code pages) with some fonts in WordPad
    are solved in Corel WordPerfect, an older version of which I have, this problem
    remains in that program as well - it isn't just limited to Microsoft programs."

    no guarantee, as usual...

    What's more, is that when I set the fonts to 9pt in MS Word, they ALL show up
    as BoldItalic. When I set them to ANY OTHER font size, then work as previously
    (all the fonts show up correctly except the Bold font).\r\n\r\nThis just keeps
    getting more and more odd. This ONLY happens on the fonts that you have modified.
    The original Baskervald fonts do not exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\n"

      in Fontforge, then I opened the OS/2 attributes (Element -> Font Info -> OS/2).
      Under the \"Metrics\" Tab for each font, I enabled the check box titled \"Really
      use Typo metrics\", which is an additional bit that MS looks for. Under the
      \"Panose\" Tab, I changed various parameters to be more in line with the [[http://books.google.com/books?id=qrElYgVLDwYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|information
      I discovered in Yannis Haralambous and P. Scott Horne's book, Fonts & Encodings]].\r\n\r\nOnce
      this was done, I simply re-generated the fonts and then installed them. I also
      incremented the version number to 1.021 (because it took me several tries to
      get it right...and I wanted to make sure Windows was showing the latest version).\r\n\r\n[[http://sns.jeffandeden.com/Baskervald1.021.zip|Here's

      to the original author (we have been exchanging emails). FontForge didn't like
      the DSIG tables encountered in the original OTF files, and some information/data
      may have been removed. Hirwen will probably generate his own fixed version of
      the font (which I would prefer anyway)."
