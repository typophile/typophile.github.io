  body: Hmm, not sure about Franklin, unless I'm looking at the wrong foundry. Franklin
    has those ink trap-like things where the vertical lines aren't perfectly vertical
    as they near the joints (see the N). It's also a little wide. Not Gotham Condensed
    either, but that looks closer to me.

    but it isn\u2019t Franklin nonetheless."

  body: Jan, you're right. Maybe ink traps is ther wrong word. I was looking at the
    ITC version (I also think Ink Traps is the wrong term for what I'm describing).
    I've tried variations of Gill and Font Bureau's Agenda and Benton Sans, but nothing
    is lining up...
