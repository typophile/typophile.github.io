  I'm making a badge-style design and I'm looking for some good mid-century fonts.
  Also, there's one I've seen that is outlined pretty cool (attached image). \r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can recommend some cool fonts for this project, I'd really appreciate it.
  Perhaps there's a good resource online that categorizes fonts from different eras?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\na"

  body: "One way to locate fonts from different time periods is to search on the time
    periods. At MyFonts you can use something like \"1800s\", or \"1940s\" as search
    terms and get fonts that should have originated (or be typical) of those time
    periods.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, everyone. Yeah - that's how I've been searching on myfonts.com until
    now. I was just wondering if there was another way people paired fonts from different
    eras. I'm always sorta looking for inspiration from various timeperiods - but
    I'm most drawn to the different typographic styles of the midcentury designers.\r\n\r\nI'll
    check out veer.com and see what I can find.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for the help.
    It's really appreciated.\r\n\r\na"

  body: "In some of my Guides I have made an effort to give the design dates of the
    fonts (typefaces) represented in the Guides. This is most complete in the Serif
    and Script Guides. \r\n\r\nThere is a text file from the spreadsheet used to create
    the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php\">Serif Guide</a>
    (link at the bottom of the page) which you can re-constitute back into spreadsheet
    form and scan down the Design date column to find designs from any era. \r\n\r\nThe
    Script Guide has the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html\">Script
    Font Reference List</a>, which has a Google search for the bowfinprintworks.com
    pages. If you enter a date you will see results that include that date in the
    font entries, for any of the Guides. It could be a bit tedious, but it would work.\r\n\r\nThe
    Sans Guide is in the process of adding design data, but it is only partial at
    this point.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
