body: "Hebrew Typography is somewhat alone in the field of typographical design.\r\n\r\nFor
  example, Hebrew is all one case, unlike most Roman languages. There is no upper
  and lower case. Most traditional Hebrew type design has dominant or thicker horizontal
  stroke widths, compared to its less dominant or thinner vertical stroke widths.
  Therefore matching designs in Roman languages, like English, is extremely difficult
  or odd-looking compared to most traditional Hebrew type designs. \r\n\r\nAs more
  and more sans-serif designs become more prevalent in Roman languages, such as English,
  and non-Roman languages, such as Hebrew, it is possible to \"match\" Hebrew designs
  to English designs.\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of this, is the tremendous work
  of type designer Boruch Gorkin. His\r\ndesign, \"Ariel-Hebrew\", is a succesful
  example of this.\r\n\r\nI created an original serif design inspired by \"Ariel-Hebrew\",
  and called it, \"Safed\", for WinSoft Ltd. of Grenoble, France and Adobe's popular
  ME (Middle East) versions of its software products.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting typeface
  design issue unique to Hebrew is the eye movement factor found in the shapes of
  certain Hebrew letters.\r\n\r\nFor example, Henri Friedlander (the great Hebrew
  type designer of the sixties) told me a secret of good Hebrew type design. Although
  the \"vov\" Hebrew character shape is basically a single vertical stroke, with a
  short thicker horizontal stroke at the tip of the vertical stroke, nevertheless
  Friedlander insisted that the entire graphic shape should be slightly tilted, so
  the upper left-sided stroke \"leans\" to the left, and the vertical stroke is slightly
  closer to the right the further lower it goes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this design
  is for subtle eye movement, making the eye move rapidly across the page, from right
  to left, the direction of the reader's eye in Hebrew.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the \"reish\"
  and \"tov\" Hebrew character shape in older classic Hebrew type design are designed
  in such a way that the thin vertical stroke on the right-hand side does not reach
  the baseline, as if to stand slightly above the ground. The purpose of this again
  is to guide eye movement. By leaving a space between the baseline and the beginning
  of the letter form just above the baseline, emphasis is placed upon the thicker
  horizontal element of the \"reish\", and downwards to the left-hand baseline element
  of the \"tov\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these qualities of eye movement has been lost
  by most Hebrew type designers today.\r\n\r\n"

  body: So, it's sort of an upward and leftward movement you speak of? To what extent
    can they be applied beyond the the "vov", "tov", and "reish" (and by extension
    "he" and "dalet" etc)?
