body: "Ok, I am taking the previous advice and concentrating solely on the logo now.
  I have spoken with the client in much detail regarding the nature of fiberoptics
  and done my own research as well. Please give me your thoughts on the new logo I
  am working on.\r\n\r\nTo refresh memories:\r\n\u2022 Business is a network design
  firm specializing in fiberoptic and UTP transmission of packetized digital audio.\r\n\u2022
  They would like to emphasize the fiberoptic approach since it is higher bandwidth,
  hence more reliable for realtime applications.\r\n\u2022 Their clients are looking
  for the complete design and installation of a digital audio network in the following
  locations: broadcast studios, recording studios, performance venues, stadiums, clubs,
  campuses.\r\n\u2022 Largest competitor is <a href=http://www.afassoc.com/>Ascent
  Media</a>, although Ascent is working a much larger demographic.\r\n\u2022 Their
  primary needs for identity are website, storefront, letterhead, invoice, and business
  cards.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'Better than the last go around. Could you make some separation from the name
    and the tagline and the art. Leave the name in orange but make it a lighter orange
    to contrast better with the gray (tone wise they are to close), try making the
    tagline white or a tint of the gray and the artwork either white or tint of gray
    or orange. Make a hierarchy of what is important, like: Name number one, Tagline
    number two and Graphic number three. What is happening now is everything is vieing
    for the same attention. '

    it is better, from what I can see.

  body: "When making an outline of a typeface it is usually better to have the outline
    on the outside of the original face because Illustrator and Freehand apply stroke
    to either side of the path in equal amounts (a simple way of doing this, in this
    case, is to have two layers one with double the amount of stroke required and
    the second above the first with a fill of the background colour). The audio device
    at the side looks a bit sonar, try rotating it to parallel with the type.\r\nTim"

  body: Timd is right but if you are working in Illustrator the way to do this is
    add a new stroke In the appearances pallet and make it behing the original stroke
    and make it larger. If you need a demo drop me a line.

    type. Even though the solid type is smaller, visually it has more weight and therefore
    draws the most focus, away from the brand name.\r\n\r\nDevelop a strong concept
    in black and white first.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You have all offered very helpful suggestions as usual! Thanks.\r\n\r\nDan
    and Timd, you are correct of course. I approached the outline the wrong way and
    ended up distorting the negative space inside the characters. You will find this
    corrected. My intent was not to outline the characters, as much as to fill the
    characters with a double line. Or rather to draw them with a double line in the
    first place. I could not figure out how to do this in Illustrator, short of carefully
    editing each character by hand, so I faked it with an outline. I believe this
    new version conveys the idea a little better. \r\n\r\nIt is meant to portray the
    look of the most popular type of fiber optic cable used. It is a duplex style
    (2 cables seamed together) in bright orange. If you were to have an install by
    this company you would most likely see this cable everywhere. And having seen
    the logo you will hopefully remember forever who did it.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://typophile.com/files/new-logo-expanded-fiberpack.gif>Here's

  body: "Not digging the outlines still. I also think the tracking is too tight. The
    letters are starting to merge into one another and form different shapes.\r\n\r\nNow
    the tagline is too light, almost to the point of \"why should it be there\"?\r\n\r\nThe
    fading audio boxes to the right of the O actually work against the logo. I believe
    they subliminaly suggest that the product is of low quality, since they are so
    weak and faded.\r\n\r\nI do like what you have started with the O. It is developing
    into a mark. I would explore that further.\r\n\r\n"

  body: FIBERPACK AUDIO is 1970s tight. Its not a quick read, let it breathe, also
    put a full space between Fiberpack and Audio. Everything feels squooshed packed
    together if thats your intention you succeeded. The graphic is fading away did
    you try it in a lighter gray or white?

  body: Much better but ask your self how will this logo be used If it is going to
    be used in sizes smaller than your posts, the elements and type will fall apart
    or clog (printing). You might design it two ways Version 1 used for sizes above
    X and Version 2 on sizes below X or Version 1 used for web purposes only and Version
    2 on printed material.

  body: Outline is a little strong. What about just having "Audio" outlined and Fiberpack
    solid. May make it more legible and put stress on Audio. My 2 cents.

    to the client yet, but I feel he is going to like it alot. However in our last
    conversation he told me he would like to pay me more if I can give him several
    different designs to choose from. So I am posting 2 new designs. Please bear with
    me, I know I have posted alot on this project. :) Thanks!\r\n\r\n<a href=http://typophile.com/files/fiberpack-logo-trio.gif>Here's

  body: "No vote on #2. It's awkward looking. I guess if you refine the \"loop\" a
    little more it could be a candidate.\r\n\r\n#3 is still the strongest, but those
    teeny, tiny marks inside the O will disappear at a smaller size, like on a business
    card.\r\n\r\n#1 is too difficult to read and there are awkward joins between the
    two words. Something I want to point out-when \"fusing\" two shapes, letterforms
    or otherwise, you need to be aware of not only the shape you are creating, but
    the shape of the negative area as well. On #1, there is a weird negative space
    between the k and the upside-down A. Something to remember for future designs."

  body: "As regards to showing multiple designs, I tend to agree with the late Mr.
    Rand's perspective. Show only one, and show the best. Don't give the client an
    opportunity to choose an inferior design, because most of the time they will.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with adnix. From a compositional perspective, #3 is by far the strongest
    -- but the \"O\"'s internals might get lost a smaller sizes. My eye tells me that
    there is perhaps too much going on around the \"O,\" which distracts from the
    typography."

  body: You are getting the contrast and prioritizing aspect of your logo. Avoid gradients
    as in number 2 they cause production problems and it will come back to bite you.
    Number 1 looks like a mistake, Audio doesn't read. As I noted before number 3
    will fall apart or fill-in in small sizes. I also suggest trying to make anything
    you design work in black and white (tints of black are fine). The reason is any
    fatal design flaws can be hidden by color. Also test your designs at the smallest
    size you know they will be used. One last note do not let your client take a piece
    from one design and a piece from another design, that is how the Camel was made.
