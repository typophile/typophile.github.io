    is a better option.

  body: "It is from a logo I need to recreate. No PDFs available. I have more characters
    if that would help.\r\nIdentifying the font is not critical, but it looked vaguely
    familiar, and since I've had relatively quick ID's made here in the past, I thought
    it was worth a post.\r\nThanks."
