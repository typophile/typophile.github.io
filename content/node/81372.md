body: "In the next weeks the translated versions of Letterfontein will appear worldwide
  in the bookstores. The English, French, Spanish and German versions are published
  by Taschen Publishers. \r\nAlready in 1994 I wrote this book with my collegue Geert
  Setola and we published it by ourselves in Dutch, French and German. It was quite
  a success and we printed about 15,000 of all these languages. In 2002 I began rewriting
  and expanding the book. Geert Setola did not take part anymore in this huge job
  where the content went from appr. 15,000 words to 150,000 words. The first Dutch
  print in november 2009 was sold out in a couple of weeks and in march 2010 the reprint
  appeared. In 2010 Letterfontein got also a red dot award and a certificate for high
  design quality form the Type Directors Club New York (TDC). It took about a year
  to get it well translated in the different languages for Taschen Publishers. For
  the English version  we asked John A. Lane to proofread it. For the Spanish version
  Albert Corbeto did the proofreading. At the end of April 2011 Letter Fountain should
  be available around the world. The resp. titles are: Fuente de Letras (Sp), La Fontaine
  aux Lettres (Fr) and Letterfont\xE4ne (German)."
