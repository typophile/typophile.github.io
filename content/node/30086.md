  to see this samples so that where I am  coming from and where I am going .\r\nI
  am trying to do modern looking font and yet I don\u2019t want to abandon the traditional
  beauty .\r\nIn other words I want to exploit all the modern design Standards and
  the traditional quality .\r\nUnlike Ethiopic  fonts out their my font will be very
  close to Latin sans.\r\nEben I agree when you say there is a lot of room for improvement
  . Your point is well taken Clotting at the joint, good elegant flow most of all
  to make it \r\nUseable in usable at smaller pt sizes.\r\nI am posting this images
  so that everybody can see different Ethiopian writing system. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe first

  body: 'These calligraphic examples sure show big spacing! And while there is more
    variety in heights shown in these examples than we see in Naomi, there seems to
    be less than in Nyala. Interesting! The thing I noticed the most however was that
    the in largest example of calligraphic writting, the one with altrenating red
    and black lines of text - the glyphs really set up nicely with each other. They
    also feel lively, not just because of the oblique angel but because of the motion
    of the shapes. And the excellent way they relate to each other. I sure like that.
    I think that integrating some of the variation in thickness we talked about will
    help bring some of that into Naomi. I would like Naomi take some of that in. Not
    lots, but a little. But are you interested in that feeling at all? '

      . I don't like too rigid & too mechanical forms in the font. curves sure will
      give Naomi more expression anb beauty .most of all that is how Ethiopic is .
      If you see the intention of the calliographers it is to make it livily than
      mechanical . I also like Adams tought not latinizing non latin font . \r\n\r\nhow
      hard is to achive that ?  "

  body: "<cite> how hard is to achive that ? </cite>\r\n\r\nI suppose that depends
    on insight & talent. ;-) \r\n\r\nThe thing ( i think ) that is happening in the
    example I like is that the calligrapher is placing the forms next to each other
    in such a way that they balance nicely. You can create a special spacing of two
    glyphs in a font by kerning. Doing that in some cases will get you nearer to that
    goal. Of course, ideally speaking you would get the basic spacing values and shapes
    as close to ideal to begin with - and then kern. Afterwards you may find that
    you have to redesign some shapes as a result of your looking at spacing & kerning
    as well. Do you how to kern yet?\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is happening is that
    the caligrapher is making subtle changes to the shapes of the glyphs themselves
    in their context to make them fit even more nicely together. You could do this
    in an opentype font via scripting. But I recommend doing the basic stuff first!
    Then in a year or two you might come back & make a 'pro' version with 'contextual
    altrenates'.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first step is to get some flow into naomi again.
    Not very much but just a little. Then the flow will have to be made to feel unified.
    It may be tricky. But I think it's worthwhile. :-) Then spacing. Then kerning."

  body: "I just bump on this site by accident when looking for developments on Ethiopic
    font typefaces. My biggest frustration is the readability of Ethiopic characters
    on a computer screen. Your first picture looks very interesting to me \u2013 very
    readable on computer screens. I don\u2019t believe we have to stick to the 19
    century typefaces in the 21st century. Does anyone know if there are developments
    on this issue? The new Microsoft Nyala typeface, which will come with Vista, is
    an improvement but according to me not that good enough.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAya\r\n"

    you like to see developments go in? Ato is workling on two solutions at the moment
    but I will leave it to him to speak about them.

    very sophiticated but has one foot in the world of the calligrapher. Talking to
    Ato I got the sense that he is keen on something which is more modern in feeling
    and is more fully typographic in orientation. "
