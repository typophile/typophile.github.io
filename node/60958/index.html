		<div class="commentbody"><p>Reed — the seven champions aren&rsquo;t <em>Who</em>s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I entitled this paper The Seven Champions of Typography I had in mind (being a lay person) the seven champions of Christendom, the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, stars, deadly sins, liberal arts, and some other &lsquo;sevens.&rsquo; But on counting up my champions, I was disconcerted to discover that there were but six [. . .]. So I propose to make my title good by adding to six Champions of Typography — Spacing, Leading, Indentation, Ink, Paper, and Imposition — one more — the most important of all, without which (as is alleged of charity) the rest profiteth nothing. That Seventh Champion, dear Reader, is <em>You.</em> And it all depends on how seriously you take the following pages, whether my title turns out to be truth or falsehood! I assume for it no further responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And No, sorry Inka, I won&rsquo;t key in the whole essay for you. Perhaps you could assign the task to one of your students for extra credit.</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t wish to get into a discussion about copyright.</p>
<p>(i don&rsquo;t get the impression either of you know enough
about the topic for me to engage you productively, but
if you want me to try, just let me know, and i&rsquo;ll do a bit.)</p>
<p>i was merely pointing out that when someone comes here
and talks about copying a font, everyone assumes the worst
and jumps all over them with a copyright infringement lecture.</p>
<p>yet when someone comes here and wants a copy of some text,
everybody is very accommodating, and gives them no lecture&hellip;
heck, you&rsquo;ll google it for them, and even offer to do o.c.r. on it.</p>
<p>i have a single standard &ndash; i don&rsquo;t care in either situation, and
wouldn&rsquo;t get tied in a knot even if it were my font or my text &ndash;
but i do get a chuckle out of the double standard that exists here.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>[sigh]</p>
<p>first of all, nothing is that cut-and-dried with copyright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;fair use&rdquo; can be used as a <em>defense</em> in court, certainly,
but the criteria are multifaceted, and it&rsquo;s up to a judge&hellip;</p>
<p>further, some of the <em>other</em> criteria would <em>not</em> be met
in this case &ndash; e.g., the essay is being used in toto &ndash;
considerations which complicate the issue substantially.</p>
<p>the fact that the property is being actively commercialized,
as represented by its presence on amazon, is also relevant.</p>
<p>plus it is telling that the content is applicable to the class;
if it was a piece on physics, or fortune-telling, or football,
and thus inapplicable to the coursework, that&rsquo;d be different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copying for educational purposes is covered
by different standards than regular copyright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe a lawyer would put it in exactly that manner&hellip;
then again, i&rsquo;m not a lawyer, so i can&rsquo;t say.  are you a lawyer?</p>
<p>but educational institutions still have to respect copyright&hellip;</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll bet you dollars to donuts that if inka ran this question by
the school lawyers, they would advise against using the text,
precisely because landing in court is the last thing they want.</p>
<p>the problem with copyright in this computer day-and-age
is that real people have to waste their real time and energy
being concerned about penny-ante crap questions like this.</p>
<p>(i originally wanted to say &ldquo;mickey-mouse crap questions&rdquo;,
but that would&rsquo;ve been a freudian slip of major proportions.)</p>
<p>at any rate, i remind people that i don&rsquo;t care what inka does;
i was pointing out the double-standard here on copyright&hellip;</p>

<p>It is also possible to use texts that are in the public domain. 
Some generous people have worked to make them available. 
Have a look at the link <a href="http://z-m-l.com/">http://z-m-l.com/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>except the texts at z-m-l.com are just 
reworked e-texts from project gutenberg.
i suggest you go to the source, where there 
are thousands more than at z-m-l.com.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gutenberg.org">http://gutenberg.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>more to the point here, most digitization of project gutenberg 
e-texts these days is being done by &ldquo;distributed proofreaders&rdquo;,
a collaborative system that allows collaboration on digitization.</p>
<p>(and, in the process, wastes lots of the time and energy of its
generous volunteers due to a workflow that is byzantine, but
hey, let&rsquo;s not let that stand in the way for the time being, ok?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pgdp.net">http://pgdp.net</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>as people have noted here, this essay in question <em>might</em>
be in the public-domain.  it&rsquo;s extremely unclear, since it was
published in 1924, just missing the pre-1923 cutoff which
would ensure that it was public-domain.  but if it hasn&rsquo;t had
its copyright renewed, it would indeed now be public domain.</p>
<p>thus, if you can get someone at distributed proofreaders to
develop an interest in the essay, they would do the gruntwork
of seeing if it can be cleared, plus they would do the work of
actually digitizing it.  it might take them a while &ndash; years? &ndash;
since they are badly backlogged, but it could happen faster&hellip;
no matter how long it takes, if it is public domain, you would
have comfort that project gutenberg is willing to take the heat
for making that decision (and defending it in court, if need be),
so that you could proceed without fear of litigation in the future.</p>
<p>again, i think inka should just go ahead and proceed with using it,
as the odds that anyone will clamp down on them are very slight&hellip;
i was just remarking about the double-standard here on copyright.</p>

<p>p.s.  and again, it&rsquo;s stupid that the law creates this field of obstacles.</p>

<p>When the type designers on this forum* complain about copyright infringements they are still alive and kicking (not dead for more than 50 years), trying to earn a crust by designing typefaces, and bowerbird gleefully reminds them of their impotence to stop said infringements. And lo and behold he now emerges to defend text copyright, and spots double standards at the same time. Please give me a break, the creature is a troll.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>if inka lives in australia, then the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is probably solved!
(project gutenberg has an australian contingent which will do
the books that&rsquo;re in the public domain there but not in the u.s.)</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not &ldquo;defending&rdquo; &ndash; or challenging &ndash; any kind of copyright&hellip;</p>
<p>my tuning fork resonates most strongly to proudhon&rsquo;s assertion
&ndash; &ldquo;property is theft&rdquo; &ndash; and &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; property is very sticky,
since you can light a thousand candles from your own candle and
it still remains lit, so what have you lost?  our entire species is a
testament to the value of sharing wisdom, and now some people
want to put a toll-station on <em>their</em> output and make us all pay.</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m most certainly not &ldquo;gleeful&rdquo; when i remind you of your
impotence to stop &ldquo;infringements&rdquo; of your little legal licenses&hellip;
i&rsquo;m just relating the facts.  there&rsquo;s nothing to be &ldquo;gleeful&rdquo; about.</p>
<p>if inka would&rsquo;ve just found the text and used it in the class, then
the odds that anyone would have found out would&rsquo;ve been small.
of course, once you announce something like this on the internet,
you&rsquo;ve broadcast it to the world, and google can track it easily, but
if it weren&rsquo;t for that, the owners of this &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; would
have been quite impotent in terms of detecting this &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; usage.</p>
<p>so, mr. paragraph, if you can&rsquo;t see the double standard i point out,
you are blind, and probably willfully so.  so much for your insults&hellip;
but it&rsquo;s quite interesting to see how much effort you will expend to
misrepresent my position and misinterpret my motivation, all while
doing absolutely nothing to add any substance to the topic at hand.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, let me get this straight. It&rsquo;s OK to steal this guy Updike&rsquo;s stuff because he&rsquo;s dead. And anyway, it would be OK because it&rsquo;s educational. (This is cool, because all text is educational, isn&rsquo;t it?)
Look, inka found where to get the essay. (What kind of name is inka?)
So this thread is up for grabs.
Ahoy, mateys!</p>
<p>Check this out - I&rsquo;m going to do a blog post about it:</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a font named Droid that was released under the Apache license. In other words, royalty free. (I&rsquo;m sure BB knows about it - comes with the Android SDK.)
Now, it seems Ascender was involved in creating it and has it on their web site and wants $90 for the three serif Droid fonts that I just downloaded for free. (Another $90.00 for the sans that I also got free.)
What&rsquo;s the frackin' $180.00 for?
This gives me an idea, though. I&rsquo;ll become a free font vendor myself and see who&rsquo;s stupid enough to pay me. Why not? Justify the price as a &ldquo;download cost&rdquo;. A service fee.</p>
<p>Oh, what a tangled web we weave.</p>
<p>As Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall put it - &ldquo;It all depends on whose ox is being gored, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

Ascender wants 120.00 for the Serif set alone.</p>

Both my posts contained links, the first one to the relevant US law on the US government website, the latter one to National Library of Australia, which is run by the federal government here. The bit about being dead is actually part of the duration of copyright definitions worldwide, roughly 50-70 years after the creators death. Why don&rsquo;t you have a read about copyright instead of quoting justices out of context?</div>

<p>the topic at hand is someone wanted a copy of something&hellip;</p>
<p>surely, when someone wants a copy of something, it can&rsquo;t be
off-topic to bring up the legality of obtaining a copy, can it?,
because that happens often when the &ldquo;something&rdquo; is a font&hellip;</p>

that it was striking that there was not a peep in this thread.)</p>

confident that &ndash; due to your personal vendetta against me &ndash;
you&rsquo;d help me do such derailing by responding so fervently to 
my posts, each and every one of &lsquo;em.  mission accomplished!</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get it.  why am i so important to you, mr. schmoeger?

<p>that first link didn&rsquo;t address the question at hand.
(or, if it did, please cite the particular paragraphs.)
as i said, given a <em>1924</em> publication date, the only
safe assumption is that it&rsquo;s still under u.s. copyright.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the latter one to National Library of Australia, 
which is run by the federal government here.</p>

<p>the second link didn&rsquo;t address the question either,
unless inka happens to be located in australia&hellip;</p>
<p>-bowerbird</p>
<p>p.s.  i certainly hope inka is planning to proceed&hellip;</p>
<p>p.p.s.  even if the copyright was renewed, this book
might be an orphan, in which case google will free it,
at least if google books gets its &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; approved,
in which case you will be able to purchase it from google.
of course, we can also assume that google will sniff out
all the &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; copies &ndash; google knows where they are! &ndash;
and shut them down, so as to protect their &ldquo;investment&rdquo;&hellip;
so if you want a copy of that essay, you should get it now!</p>

<p>Relax, man. I&rsquo;m a sinner and a hypocrite just like everybody at times. (And Mr. Fink is my father, he&rsquo;s in a nursing home, call me Rich).
It&rsquo;s the nature of the world we live in today. All I hear you advocating is living life, sharing information with other people. The problem we&rsquo;ve all got is that we can&rsquo;t help but break the law when we do that. At least technically.
This is a bad situation. IP law has a long history and it&rsquo;s sanctioned by the US Constition. I don&rsquo;t have enough years left to see a resolution of this in the legislatures or the courts.
But the maxim, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sue everybody&rdquo;, surely holds.
And in some cases I would advocate civil disobedience.
But I can&rsquo;t tell you when I would advocate that lest I be accused of contributory infringement. (hah!)</p>
<p>BTW, Thurgood Marshall wasn&rsquo;t talking about copyright, I just liked the phrase which was most surely not original with him. You&rsquo;re somewhat correct, I should have made that clear. Marshall also used to say, &ldquo;Hey, Chiefy Baby!&rdquo; when passing Chief Justice Warren Berger in the hall - because he knew it would make him squirm a little.</p>
