  is great. But everyone also said to take my work to the next level I needed to hand
  draw my type. The problem is that I am scared...I know just enough about type to
  be dangerous...any one have some tips for me?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance!"

  body: "Go buy some calligraphy books, buy some nibs and pens and inkwells, and practice
    some calligraphic letterforms. You'll learn to appreciate every part of the letter.\r\n\r\nGet
    a sketchbook with grids and draw. Then draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw,
    draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw,
    draw, draw, draw. Then some more. The more you draw the better and more familiar
    you will become with the letters. :) \r\n\r\nMike's advice, \"Stay loose with
    no expectations, have fun with it all most importantly and let things naturally
    develop from there,\" is probably the best advice to have. Wise words!"

  body: "I'd recommend starting with a few simple exercises to get rid of blank page
    syndrome - start by enlarging some letters from one of your own typefaces, or
    some favorite fonts, then get out the tracing paper and just practice for a while
    to get used to it. Then move on to copying the letters rather than tracing over
    them. The next step is practice modifying the letters. All of this will simply
    serve to get you comfortable with the process and improve your hand skills. When
    you're feeling more confident, try doing some simple monoline sketches to act
    as a sort of skeleton, then flesh out the shapes or trace over them using brushes
    or flexible steel nibs, etc. The thing to remember is that is that takes time
    and patience and A LOT of letter drawing to get good at it.\r\n\r\nHave fun with
    it!\r\n\r\n~ Laura"
