body: "We are currently developing packaging for consumer electronics. The packaging
  design guidelines have been established for these products being sold in the North
  America, Asia, Australia and Europe. We've had no issues up to this point with translations
  into French for our Canadian customers. However, we need to do package layouts in
  Hungarian and Czech. We are running into a situation where not all of the language
  characters necessary for Hungarian and Czech are available in the font set we are
  using.\r\n\r\nWe are using Signa Extended and Myriad Pro.\r\n\r\nMy questions are
  as follows:\r\n\r\nSigna Extended does not have all the necessary characters, is
  there a work around or is it a case where we will have to create those characters?\r\n\r\nMyriad
  Pro works fine in Adobe Illustrator but because we are a global company, some of
  the designers are using Quark 6.0. When the type is pasted from Illustrator into
  Quark, all of the type turns into gibberish and is useless. Does Quark 6.0 handle
  type that differently that it would cause such a drastic change in type?"

  body: "QuarkXPress 6 does not fully support OpenType features, especially the extended
    glyphs. The reason is that in software dimensions it is ancient. So, no chance
    of using Myriad Pro with Quark 6 and wanting to access these special characters!
    QXP 7 can fully handle OpenType as far as I have heard.\r\n\r\nIf you want to
    prepare documents in other languages switch to InDesign, or choose a typeface
    that has localised versions -- For example, Signa exists as Central European version."
