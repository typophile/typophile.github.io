body: 'A weird thing--If I select Fournier Expert, or Minion Expert, in Quark 6, or
  in Font Book, or Suitcase X1, it doesn&#39;t display anything except the fractions.
  But I can see all of the characters in InDesign CS. <BR>Just did a set of book galleys
  where I used Expert for the ligatures, and I couldn&#39;t see any of them, even
  though they print out fine. <BR>Using Mac OS 10.3.5. Any body else have this problem,
  or know what to do about it? <BR> <BR>Related questions: TypeTool shows them, but
  if I try to type them in the TypeTool metrics window, the fractions &amp; ligs are
  not on the same keys that they are when I type them in a layout program.'

  body: I&#39;m having this same problem with Freehand MX and Spectrum Expert. The
    ligatures within the &#34;regular&#34; font show up fine, but ff, ffl, and ffi
    don&#39;t show up. InDesign shows them just fine. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also using
    Mac OS 10.3.5.

  body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I found out that this was just a Quark 6 problem. Actually, Font
    book and Suitcase were okay &#40;the ligs just weren&#39;t in the sample text
    shown&#41;  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s still a problem in Quark 6--but not the OS. Hope
    that helps!
