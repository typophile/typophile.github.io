body: In my font, letters are properly corrected. But when I use Arabic marks such
  as Kasre or Fathe, then these marks are very baldy positioned or they make letters
  get disjoint. Why this happens? Is it the glyphs that have problems or I must add
  some lookup to my font? I have attached a sample to show what I mean.

    positioning lookups to your font."
