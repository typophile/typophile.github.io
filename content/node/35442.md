  departments. I was wondering what fonts i can use for the type? it's not commercial
  and i'm not charging for the work, does this affect anything? the font \"tw cent\"
  goes really well with the design i have so far but i don't want to use it if the
  school become liable for any legal discressions!\r\nalso, while i'm asking questions,
  are there any good websites explaining the rules on typeface use and permissions?\r\nany
  tips or points in the right direction are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    design and distribute that design in a logo, book, etc. It doesn't matter whether
    it's commercial or not. The main caveat is that some foundries restrict the ability
    to embed fonts (such as in PDFs) (and some are picky about using it on the web),
    but that only applies to those situations. I am pretty sure that Twentieth Century
    will not have that restriciton, but if you want to be sure, you can search for
    the foundry and check out their [[EULA]]. Again, this is only if you need to create
    PDFs, Flash, etc.; normal logos (JPEG, GIF, outlined type in EPS, etc.) should
    be fine. \r\n\r\nThe main point of license agreements is to state on how many
    computers you can have the font and to prohibit copying, pirating, modifying,
    and the like. There are numerous permutations, but you're completely in the clear
    for what you're doing."

  body: "Well, my quick edit put my post below yours, so sorry for mixing things up.\r\n\r\nIf
    you did acquire the font illegally, then I'm not sure as to the legality of making
    a logo with it -- I'd hedge on the side of that not being allowed. But Twentieth
    Century comes with Windows, I believe, and if you didn't get it legally, you can
    buy a version for about $20 from myfonts.com . Worth it for a clean conscience,
    I hope."

  body: "Hi,\r\nthanks for the advice! the TW font was installed on my laptop when
    i got it, i haven't downloaded it from anywhere dodgy. the school i'm doing it
    for doesn't really have much of a web presence and as far as i know they don't
    intend to promote the departments anywhere outside of the school or on the web
    so i think what auricfuzz told me there should be fine. i'm starting a degree
    in graphics in september and really want to learn typography inside out so i guess
    this will be a good place to start!\r\nthanks again to you both.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just to summarize, since you got Twentieth Century with your computer (as
    I did), you do not need to be afraid of using the logo on the web or in outside
    or commercial publications -- otherwise many logos that we see everyday wouldn't
    exist!\r\n\r\nYou're very welcome, and you're right -- this is a fantastic place
    to learn about typography and type design!"
