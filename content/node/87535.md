  analysis. \r\n\r\nI am writing my thesis on the New Alphabet. A critical analysis
  does not seem like it is broad enough for a thesis. I need to expand! any help really
  appreciated."

    pen, using the New Alphabet?\r\n(After all, it is an alphabet\u2014unless the
    name is purely ironic\u2014and so may be rendered in many ways.)\r\nThat would
    constitute critical design, which is the appropriate form of \"critical analysis\"
    for designers.\r\nSee if you can learn to read and write fluently with it.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI
    too designed a monowidth, unicase alphabet, which I termed the Panoptic alphabet,
    and executed it in a number of different typographic styles, as the typeface Panoptica.\r\nBut
    I was not influenced by Crouwel's work.\r\nIn fact, the \"orthogonal\" version
    of it ended up looking more like Doesburg's de Stijl lettering (also revived by
    the Foundry).\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nZuzana Licko's Oblong is somewhat like New Alphabet,
    in that it exploits its constraints in an inventive, decorative/stylish manner,
    rather than putting a premium on legibility. Certainly in comparison to her earlier,
    more verbatim transcriptions of the alphabet to the low-res no-diagonal screen."

  body: "is it not maybe too esoteric and there for too illegible for general use?
    \ isn't legibility, easy reading, and easily distinguishable word patterns not
    the \"hallmark\" of modern typography?\r\n\r\nIs it because it's paired down to
    abstraction that it has become Modern? I have always read that it is illegible.\r\n\r\nI'm
    getting myself confused between the characteristics of modernist typography, and
    how it's not illegible."

  body: "Some of us prefer to distinguish between legibility and\r\nreadability; the
    former refers to the decipherability of\r\nindividual symbols, while the latter
    refers to the actual\r\nfacilitation of what some call \"immersive reading\".
    For\r\nexample a large sans-serif letter is highly legible, but\r\na lot of text
    set that way is not readable.\r\n\r\nMy contention is -and has long been- that
    Modernism\r\nis not in fact motivated by functionality, but merely\r\nthe illusion
    of functionality via [over-]simplification.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
