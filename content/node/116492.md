  guys,\r\n\r\nat the moment I'm doing a research about the history of Sign Painting
  especially in Paris. As an semester project I took pictures of Letterings in Paris
  and now I'm trying to find some information about the sign-painter profession, but
  it's not easy to find some. I started to look up the topic in the the university
  library, but I couldn't really find what I was looking for. If you search for \xBBsign
  painter(s)\xAB or \xBBsign( )painting\xAB you don't get any results and if you choose
  the term \xBBlettering\xAB you receive some books about calligraphy and modern hand-lettering.
  I also looked up the topic at the research library but I couldn't find much information
  neither. In the most cases you just get the title and the year of the publication
  as a result which isn't really helpful if you see a list of 200 books.\r\n\r\nSo
  I would like to ask you for some book recommendations related to my topic: Sign
  Painting or more exactly Sign Painting especially in Paris.\r\n\r\nThank you very
  much!\r\n\r\n"
