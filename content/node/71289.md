body: "I'm writing up a book using Adobe Caslon as the main body font, sized 11/14.5,
  and I want to use one font for figure captions, which will be placed in the margins,
  which will likely be sized around 8/11. Is there a sans-serif font that looks distinct
  enough, but does not clash with Caslon? I've been using Optima, but the results
  are debatable.\r\n\r\nAlso, I may like to use a different font for the cover page
  (very minimalist and mostly blank, except for title and name), but I'm worried about
  introducing a third font. What is the rule about that? If it is appropriate, can
  you make a suggestion to go with the sans-serif? \r\n\r\nI could do the cover in
  Caslon, but I'm not a huge fan of Caslon at large sizes."

    Caslon interpretations for example. http://www.identifont.com/find?font=caslon&q=Go\r\n\r\n<em>I

    supports the cover design, the athmosphere, better than the faces you use inside
    the book.   \r\n\r\n\r\n "
