  body: I think this might be hand calligraphy. The two "s"s in "wishes" are different
    from one another.

  body: I just noticed in one of the design threads somebody recommending Avalon and
    Sloop ... both gorgeous script typefaces with lots of flourish! They may be what
    you're looking for.

  body: Avalon and Sloop -- though both beautiful scripts -- are quite different from
    the lettering on that Christmas card. Let's see if we can find something closer.
