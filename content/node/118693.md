body: "I\u2019m having a Fontlab 5.1 issue some of your old hats will probably laugh
  about. It seems so silly, but I cannot figure this out. Since yesterday the glyphs
  of my font project, the outlines, have become unresponsive to clicking on them.
  I cannot select the outline, activate points, nothing. I can select layers, I can
  turn them off and on, visibility and all. I can select glyphs in the map. I can
  write in both, preview and the metrics window. Everything else works, except for
  selecting an outline in any layer (in mask it doesn\u2019t work either).\r\n\r\nI
  looked for a secret lock I might have activated. The only lock in the bottom left
  corner of a glyphs window is for a different purpose. There doesn\u2019t seem to
  be any feature that would prevent me from working with the outlines of glyphs, and
  yet I cannot touch my typeface again. What\u2019s going on?"

    find a way to lock or unlock it. The editing checkmark is inaccessible; it cannot
    be activated."

    is dimmed, I can\u2019t activate it. Yes, I am on Mac OS 10.10 beta (Yosemite),
    but I have been happily using Fontlab and edited fonts for two weeks since I installed
    it, without any glitch or incident. The OS version does not cause this sudden
    lockout.\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/013g2D2N0j3n"

    you can see, none of the options is accessible. The lock in the lower left corner
    should change keyboard access, but unlocking/locking it does not seem to make
    any difference; I still can\u2019t click or select the outline."

    Preferences as well as the Workspace file and do a system restart.\r\n\r\nTo access
    the preferences on OSX hold the Option key as you click on the GO menu to reveal
    the Library. In Library/Preferences/ find and trash: com.fontlab.studio5.plist\r\n\r\nIn
    that same Library go to Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio5/Workspaces/

    were messed up. A bit annoying, now that I need to enter all preferences again.
    I don\u2019t even remember all settings\u2026 But at least I can work with it
    again."
