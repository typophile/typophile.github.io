body: Couple of quick questions. <BR> <BR>Do you think a AFM file is a format that
  should be included when selling a font? <BR> <BR>We currently include these, but
  I have been told that they make it easier for people to pirate fonts.... <BR> <BR>Any
  thoughts?

  body: <i>they make it easier for people to pirate fonts...</i> <BR> <BR>Hmmm, that&#39;s
    a new one on me. How so? It seems that any of the metrics information available
    in an AFM could also be extracted from either an NFNT or SFNT resource Mac-side.
    My opinion is that AFM files are a quaint holdover from the glory days of desktop
    typesetting, when some applications had to parse the metrics independently from
    the screen fonts. Does any other platform actually use the AFM file format?

  body: It makes perfect sense to include both AFM and INF files along the standard
    PFB and PFM files when you produce PC Type 1 fonts &#40;Windows PostScript fonts&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>On MacOS X, Windows, and Unix systems, there are typesetting applications
    such as LaTeX that directly use PFB and AFM files. Not providing the AFM file
    makes the use of the font cumbersome.  <BR> <BR>Some CAD and plotting applications
    that do custom font handling use AFM files.  <BR> <BR>On some versions of Windows,
    PFM files that ship with a font may cause problems -- especially if the PostScript
    font was made with an ancient application such as Fontographer. In such case,
    the user can delete the PFM file and use ATM to create a new PFM file from AFM
    and INF &#40;both are necessary&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I cannot think of a way how providing
    AFM files could help piracy.  <BR> <BR>Adam
