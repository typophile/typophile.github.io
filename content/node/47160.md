  Store</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typ_tee_winner_promo_2008_6741.jpg]\r\n\r\nAfter
  a heated battle and much deliberation the winning tee has emerged! SN Rajpurohit
  from Ahmedabad, India has won the contest with his subission <em>Light, Regular,
  Bold & Bold Italic</em>. \r\n\r\nWe don't expect the world to get it, and that's
  parf of the point. The tee will be printed on an American Apparel shirt in \"Light
  Blue\" with gray ink. Stay tuned for pre-order information.\r\n\r\nSatya will receive
  a copy of the mighty <strong>[[FontBook]]</strong> (A $99 USD value, thanks to FontShop!)
  and a $100 gift certificate to <a href=\"http://www.threadless.com\"><strong>Threadless</strong></a>,
  (thanks Skinnycorp!).\r\n\r\nThank you for the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/typophile_tee_contest_2008\">hundreds
  of entries</a>. We had a difficult time judging them all. "

    the stripes going all the way up, but that would probably make it impractical

  body: The stripes from bottom to the shoulder seem would be almost impossible. It
    can't be done with a single screen that would be correctly positioned for the
    variety of shirt sizes we plan to offer. Getting a small Womens and a Mens XL
    to both work well is more than tricky. Thus, we modified it by cropping it at
    the chest. In the end, I think the asymmetry is a nice way to stay true to Satya's
    design.
