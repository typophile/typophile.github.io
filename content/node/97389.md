  body: 'These are not fonts, they are painted by hand. If you want this look, it''s
    best to have a <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:stewf/t:letterer">lettering artist</a>
    do it. If you must use type, here are some related sources: <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit">Sign

  body: Thanks Stephen, I figured as much, but I still thought I could find something
