body: Can anyone id this one for me? It&#39;s from an old 35mm slide holder package,
  circa 50s. It looks similar to Chank&#39;s Liquorstore, but of course it can&#39;t
  be. <BR> <BR>Any idea what the original is called? <BR>Thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41662.jpg"

  body: BTW, &#39;Font from the Fifties&#39; was alliterative license. We all know
    &#39;font&#39; meant something else in those days.
