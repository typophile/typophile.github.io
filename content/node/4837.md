body: 'Major Israeli type vendors today distribute their fonts in several formats.
  One of those formats is called &#34;X Fonts&#34; or &#34;Mirror Fonts&#34;, which
  are essentially horizontally-flipped versions of the original font files, for use
  in applications such as Macromedia Freehand and Flash, that don&#39;t have native
  support for Hebrew &#40;or for any other Semitic, right-to-left language, for that
  matter&#41; - the text blocks are then &#34;flipped&#34; again in the application
  itself, and the text can be edited more-or-less normally &#40;with a few directional
  exceptions such as digits and complex punctuation&#41;. <BR> <BR>I am in the process
  of creating such &#34;X&#34; versions for my own Hebrew fonts in Fontographer, and
  the difficulty I&#39;m having is in reserving the original font&#39;s spacing, since
  the only appropriate transformational attribute in Fontographer is a center-of-selection
  based horizontal flip, the left and right sidebearings remain as they were before
  the transformation. <BR> <BR>Itay K has very helpfully suggested adding large rectangles
  which would cover each glyph, and would later be erased after the transformation
  is complete, thus flipping the sidebearings, as well. <BR> <BR>Itay&#39;s method
  works very well, but I wonder if I could maybe automate the process a bit. I&#39;ve
  developed a web-based algorythm that inputs an exported AFM file with spacing information,
  and then outputs an AFM file with corrected sidebearing information for &#34;mirrored&#34;
  spacing. I&#39;ve worked according to the AFM specifications that I downloaded here:

  target="_blank">http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5004.AFM_Spec.pdf</a>
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently attempting to import the corrected AFM files back to
  Fontographer, but it doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect. Does anybody have any
  insight or maybe someone has experienced same difficulties importing metrics, esp.
  sidebearings, into Fontographer? <BR> <BR>I would appreciate any comment or aid
  regarding this. Thanks very much!'

  body: Wow, Hrant, I&#39;m finding this much easier than the rectangle method! If
    I wouldn&#39;t find a way to use this algorythm, I&#39;ll definately use your
    suggested method. Thanks very much! <BR> <BR>Still, I need to type in different
    offsets for each character, so my previous query remains.
