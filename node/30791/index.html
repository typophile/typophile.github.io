it's technically not legal to buy a laptop in the US and bring it into the UK without paying the import duty, but sometimes I order photography gear from B&H in NYC and pay the shipping and import duty and it still is cheaper. Boy B&H has grown since I last physically shopped there. </div>

Regardless now I am in an office that runs PC's and I have to bring my laptop to work every day. It would be nice to switch back to windows for the office side of things, email and such. . .

		<div class="commentbody">I managed to install and boot Windows XP via Bootcamp; the ATI video driver Apple supplied was unable to set the proper screen resolution for either the laptop display or my external monitor. I tried to update to a not-so-ancient driver and found out I needed to install .net, which required that I install Windows Genuine advantage, which generated some useless error message. So I gave up and went right back to Mac OS.

But I do have a nice working Parallels/XP installation, which I never use because the only Windows apps I want to run are 3D games that don't have Mac ports.

Gaming was the one thing you couldn't do better on a Mac, and that was purely because no one developed any for it.

Now they don't need to. We CAN have our cake and eat it too. Without suffering from severe abdominal BSOD attacks.

I'm a gamer myself and I'm trying to keep a close eye on this, because I generally prefer Macs. So, you've seen it in action? Is it really comparable? I build my own Windows machines specifically for gaming, so I'm looking for real heavy duty horsepower. I gather the price difference is still steep and the advancements in card tech for Macs are a bit behind. If I can see Parallels and BootCamp working well, I may take the hit anyway. But I'm always interested in hearing about hands-on experience.</div>

I run all of that via DVI to my Apple 20" monitor, which is a glorious way to game, let me tell you. I may never stop, as building the PC is a big part of the fun for me, and it keeps me up to date on the latest tech. However, if I could run HL2 on a macbook...oh, man would I ever love that.

Y'know, I'm not sure. I think a little under $800. That was for the case w/ power supply, RAM, processor, motherboard, graphics card...and possibly the wireless card, but I'm not sure. The rest I carried over from my old machine. Like you, I didn't keep close track. The first time I did it was quite some time ago. I think it was $600 or so, but without the case or wireless card. I try to build machines that have solid benchmarks and long-term performance, but are still below the insane premiums you pay for the absolute latest tech (like $500 graphics cards). Reading up on benchmarks has really helped me find just the right graphics cards to balance cost and performance.
