    otherwise I haven't heard of a license that you paid for with such a restriction. "

    it 'normal'? I don't know. I think it's more of a rarity. "

  body: "It\u2019s more common than you might think. The House Industries EULA is
    the most notorious for this sort of thing (although it happens only with a high
    price ceiling), but I get the impression it\u2019s becoming more common as type
    designers start thinking about font licensing as stock licensing. The next version
    of my EULA will require any company with gross income above a certain (large)
    amount to have a special license for using a typeface in a logotype. \r\n\r\nI
    think the font industry should do serious designers a favor by requiring a special
    license for any for-profit logo use to keep commercial fonts out of logo contests
    :)"
