  Keep Six Contemporary Gallery and the Festival of  \r\nArchitecture and Design invite
  you to:\r\n\r\nMyType: An exhibit of limited-edition, new modernist \r\nposters
  by graphic design genius Noel Nanton.\r\n\r\n \r\nExhibition dates: May 2- May 18th.
  2008\r\n\r\nKeep Six Contemporary Gallery 938 Bathurst Street, Toronto, Canada.\r\nFree
  Admission.\r\n\r\nFeaturing new fonts designed by typotherapy, eye-popping popsicle
  colours, bold abstract shapes, and a very new take on classic modernist typography.\r\n\r\nStarting
  with the premise that typefaces are as expressive as the words they form, typotherapy
  has created a series of large-format posters that explore the relationship between
  positive and negative space. Letters speak, and if you remove them from the constraints
  of sentences and even words, they have a language of their own. \r\n\r\nMyType uses
  the craft of typography to find new ways of speaking using fonts famous and unknown
  including Helvetica, Avant Garde and typotherapy creations like Tomeri and VWmobile.\r\n\r\nFor
  more information visit: www.keep6c.com and www.toronto.ca/fad \r\nFor more new modernist
  design genius, visit: www.typotherapy.com\r\n\r\n"
