body: "This particular one was printed by Halstan and Co., before 1967. (Sorry for
  the pretty poor scan.)\r\n\r\nThis typeface is used on a ton of 60s scores like
  this, would be really cool if it could be ID'd. Seems to me to be one of the prettiest
  fonts because of it's transparency and simplicity. \r\n\r\nCheers.\r\nL. "

    the exact ones. \r\n\r\nCould it be a custom typeface?\r\n\r\nSome comparison

  body: 'I think this is metal. The really low res scan is hard to read, but the falling
    over italic A in the subtitle says "Caslon," though which Caslon I don''t know.
    It looks to me like the main title is in a different font from the rest, and not
    Caslon. '
