  body: "Over 9 hours & no suggested font.\r\nCan't recall offhand if there is a matching
    font, but I can give you some info. The unusual serif design from 1874 or earlier
    went under several names including Mansard and Detroit. \r\n\r\nAn 1874 font by
    the name of Cameo and digitized as a free font by Character at \r\nhttp://abfonts.freehostia.com/cameo-antique.htm
    \r\nis as close as I can find:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CameoAntiqueByCharacter_6436.jpg]\r\nSee
    also FontMesa's \"Red Dog Saloon.\"\r\nMansard is available from http://www.woodentypefonts.com\r\nHere
    is an image of Mansard:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MansardExtraBold_4211.jpg]\r\nHere
    is an image of Detroit Style from an old lettering book:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DetroitStroke@AtkinsonShowcards1912p85_4023.jpg]\r\n\r\nDon"
