  body: "You know, we had a post with a different sample of this same font a few days
    ago. Unfortunately, I think that thread had a title like this one, and now I have
    no idea where to find it. Maybe someone else who sees this will remember it.\r\n\r\nPlease
    help the IDers by using a descriptive title that we might have a chance to find
    again. \"Round Bauhaus style with serifs\" would be a good title for this thread,
    and you could edit your post to change it, I think.\r\n\r\nThis font resembles
    a font called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/horatio/|Horatio]], but with added
    serifs. I suspect it is new (possibly a freebie).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
