body: "I need to come up with a new scheme for titling these posts. Either that, or
  stop making progress.\r\n\r\nFirst we have the basically complete:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moped_scripttypohile_6070.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here is a peek at:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moped_sanstypohile_5501.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moped_sanstypohile2_6445.gif]\r\n\r\nApart
  from disconnecting the script version, many of the lowercase characters were redrawn.
  The r and s for example. The s was particularly challenging. I tried all kinds of
  crazy forms from scripty, to descending, to deco... in an effort to resolve the
  heavy stroke weight and small x-height. It's basically a game of balancing 1.stroke
  width vs. other glyphs, and 2.overall darkness of the character vs other glyphs.
  I opted to dial the slider closer to matching stroke width. Yes the s is dark, but
  at large sizes (a lets face it, this is not a workhorse text font) it was the better
  solution. I'm also reworking the caps so they will play well with each other. Some
  of these changes may work their way back into the script caps.\r\n\r\nLastly, I
  played around with an extended version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moped_retrolux_3465.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  was surprised how a little extending of the connection resulted in maximum retro-fitting.
  I also had to redraw some characters to work here.. notably the f. My initial drawing
  only works in the tight quarters of the original spacing. Extend the bar of an f
  long enough and it's not an f anymore. I also included this new variant as an alt
  in the regular script version. The caps were also a challenge, especially the non-connecting
  ones (like D). Connecting to the lc looks bad, big space looks bad, small space
  looks bad, so I ended up making extended caps and using a medium space. While this
  version pushes the design closer to existing types in the genre, I figured it was
  worth it to give Moped yet another voice.\r\n\r\nI think that is what I'm liking
  most about this little family. You can dial in the how retro you want to go: sans
  -> script -> script extended."

    Before the battle began, I designed these letters for my daughters room. She'd
    received a gift certificate from The Letter Boutique (www.theletterboutique.com)
    so I drew them up. Fabulously carved and rendered by Carrie. At risk of forever
    branding this font as \"girly\" here are the letters: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moped_quinlan_4070.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhy
    so concerned about the w???\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/w_5488.gif]\r\n\r\nDoes
    the larger image solve it for you, or is it still smooshified in your view?"

    a really interesting counter space on the w. You know what, I wonder if the right
    side needs more overshoot than the left because the curve is tighter? It looks
    a tiddly bit higher."

  body: "Bendy: Thx, this is fun! The right needs to be higher in the script version
    because it connects to the next letter at x-height. The idea is to hint at the
    loop that would be there if the font wasn't so bold , which pushes the loop above
    the x-height (see the r also). The basic shape comes from two v's looped together.
    I'll take another look.\r\n\r\nBTW, Miss T there were smileys intended there on
    my W comments. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Ah. I see what you mean. Yes it does look a bit higher though the points are
    at the same height. I think it comes from the asymmetric loop in the middle, which
    comes from the asymmetric v. I'm exploring other ideas at the moment.

  body: Seeing it larger and in one word it doesn't bother me as much. I guess it
    is just because the only other places you see that sort of curve is in the v.

  body: "I've just updated the fonts, so yes I agree! In addition to smoothing the
    pointed counters, the node placement on some of the curves was off, notably the
    bottom curve was lumpy and the top of the middle loop could have been more symmetric,
    plus the counter shapes are now more balanced.\r\n\r\nLook at anything long enough
    in isolation and it becomes weird. Must be time for bed! Thanks for your input."

  body: It might lose tension as a single form/shape, but as a glyph within a set
    of glyphs it works better. IMHO
