body: "I am doing a product design and packaging project in my Communication Design
  1 class, and i chose to make up a new sparkling fruit drink company to design a
  bottle for as well as the 6 pack cardboard holder.\r\n\r\nSo my main question is,
  does anyone have any idea how to print a logo and some text onto a  clear glass
  bottle? I am kind of stumped on this one. I am guessing they normally screen print
  onto the bottle, but i am only going to be making a couple of bottles, not a ton,
  does anyone have any ideas for the next best thing? I was thinking maybe printing
  onto some acetate, and running it through one of those adhesive machines that puts
  sticky stuff on the other side, but i don't know how professional that will look.\r\n\r\nAny
  advice is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Josh"

    returned mainly massage parlours in the US, so perhaps an alternative term is
    used there :)\r\n\r\nA more DIY approach if you have access to an inkjet printer,
    a water slip transfer might attach better than a dry rubdown.\r\nhttp://www.craftycomputerpaper.co.uk/clear%20water-slip%20decals.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.craftycomputerpaper.co.uk/Dry%20Decals%20product%20page.htm\r\n\r\nIf
    you use the acetate method trim it down to go round the bottle with a slight overlap
    at the back and then use double sided tape to attach it, most adhesives will be
    apparent and spoil the effect, so try to use as little as possible.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Inkjet or Laser transparency film is the answer (apply like Tim suggested)
    - available at most offuce supply stores, Staples, Office Depot, Office Max etc.

    is a link to a video on the link called \"View Transfer Application Video (Quicktime)\"\r\n\r\nI
    guess it is time to start calling print studios in Austin, there is bound to be
    a place that can make these rubdown graphic prints. I mean, what is the material
    actually used in those rubdown prints? I am also not too sure how well this will
    hold up on a glass bottle."

  body: "I thought it might be helpful to actually show the logo, because different
    transfer methods probably work better than other for text, or big solid logos,
    etc. There are going to be 6 flavors all together, each flavor has that fruit
    in the logo, but this is the \"Pear\" logo. I am only going to be making the bottle
    for one of the flavors. This is not my final version of the logo either, i might
    change it up a little bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/guccipingpong/cure.jpg"

    actually seems like a pretty good little machine. Only thing is it is 90 bucks,
    and i am a student right now, which makes it harder to justify spending that on
    some machine. They do have a money back guarantee though. Check out the video,
    it seems to work pretty good, and i am going to go to a design school next year
    (Art Center) hopefully, and it might come in handy.\r\n\r\nNevermind, you have
    to have a 130 dollar laminator too."

    ink-jet. Might be 'good enough' for what you need.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, use the
    acetate but don't adhere it with glue. Just wrap it tightly and fasten in the
    back.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The transfers will hold on a glass bottle, but if you are worried about spending
    90-130 dollars on a machine, you might not be happy with the price of a 2 color
    transfer. Unless Austin prices differ that much, you will probably spend that
    much or more on a 2 color 8 x 10 transfer sheet. I would take the method aluminum
    is advising with the acetate printed from an ink jet.

  body: Depending on your specific needs, cut vinyl may be a better solution for rapid
    prototyping a bottle label. It's a basic product in the sign business, and there
    are sign shops in nearly every town everywhere. It may not be a better solution
    than the dry-transfer option, but is almost certainly more readily available.
