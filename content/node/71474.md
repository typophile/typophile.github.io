    Font Bureau's secret weapon, Jill Pichotta, or as I think of her, Madame Bezier,
    for her invaluable guidance in this long process.  "

    quality as always when things are coming from Font Bureau.\r\n\r\nAlso great to
    get some competition on fresh revivals of Caslon. Now we only wish for a big article,
    comparing \"William Caslon\" and \"Replay\" with the original. \"wink, wink\"...
    John Boardley do you hear me :-) \r\n\r\nCheers"

    is showing. There is only one other thread on this. It is on the pre-release use
    of Williams Caslon in [[http://typophile.com/node/65216|Boston Magazine,]] which
    has been using it for the past year an a half. I started that thread nearly a
    year after its use in Boston Magazine, not exactly rushing to announce. "

    to see it. Come to think of it, I should get some more recent editions. I'm sure
    Nick is eager to see more :) \r\n\r\nI was delighted that FB was able to sell
    it pre-release, as I think it helps credibility to have a successful publication
    using it. "

    thread. But searching Typophile, I see that indeed, I talked up my 2006 talk at
    TypeCon about it. And since the Boston Magazine thread I've felt that since it's
    public anyway I could talk about it. \r\n\r\nNow with Flash animation on Typophile
    and at the FontBureau.com, I feel like a nerd who suddenly became Prom Queen :) "
