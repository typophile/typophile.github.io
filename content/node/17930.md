  :S \r\nI look this site for a few weeks and I see much talent here. I would need
  your assistance for a tattooing in symbiotogram.  I know that for you, expert of
  the letters, that will be like a challenge to take up and I hope for it amusing.
  \r\nThen... the name \"Karine\" must become to 180 degrees the name \"Fran\xE7ois\"...\r\nI
  send a sketch of an idea.. but I'm not ready to make a tattoo whit... this. \r\n\r\nThank
  you very much for your help... everything will be appreciate. \r\n\r\nK\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Rather than start on the computer you should really get out a pencil and paper.
    Think about the many different variations of style that the letterforms can take.
    Look at other lettering artists and ambigram artists to see how they do things.
    In the end you may have to pay someone to do this if it's really what you want.
    What you have right now is rather 'mish-mashy', keep trying...don't be content
    until it's perfect.

      don't have scanner for send it, it's better than that but not perfect for me.
      \r\nI also believe that I will have to pay somebody, but before I hoped to finding
      ideas interesting here. I keep trying while waiting if someone want to help."

  body: "John's book doesn't really tell much more than what he gives here on this
    part of his webpage: http://johnlangdon.net/ambigrams.html In the book he dives
    a bit further into his process, but again it's an artform and you can't really
    spell it out. It's easiest to experiment over and over and over until you find
    something that works, learning what corners you can cut so letters are still recognizable.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand...go buy his book. John is an amazing artist, wonderful professor
    and basically my mentor at school/inspiration for love of type. You'll enjoy it
    even if you don't end up with a finish of this project!"

  body: "I think your basic approach is sound and some of the letter combinations
    are working well, as you say patience and perserverance are going to be required,
    you could look at <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/1516?from=0&comments_per_page=50\">this
    thread</a> for some ideas. The approach I take is to draw the letters from one
    direction, turn the page and amend to work the letters from another direction,
    trace it and start the process again, whether I am working on paper or direct
    on the computer. Combining letters or using swashes to create a letter* from the
    opposite direction can be productive, especially when you have different number
    of characters in the two words.\r\n\r\nKeep at it,\r\nTim\r\n\r\n*or indeed the
    way you created the cedilla"

    some problem whit the E... or rather with the Fr of Fran\xE7ois, not the same
    style and not enought precision, but I think it's a beginning. I'm not yet enought
    familiar whit that to make swashes or ornements, but I still practice !\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/k.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f.jpg]"

  body: "I think you're onto something with your 'k' becoming an 'is'. Just needs
    a little straightening out to make it work with the other characters.\r\n\r\nI
    think you could eliminate the stroke leading into the a in Francois and bend the
    bowl of the a back to the right a bit to make the a more obviously an a without
    compromising the n. I believe the o in Francois could also get rounder as long
    as you keep that incoming stroke that makes it an a. Finally, the F might read
    better both as F and E if the top horizontal was not detached from the stem.\r\n\r\nIt's
    very cool to see sketches in progress - save these when you've arrived at a result,
    they're great. And don't give up hope, you're almost there."

  body: I think that you should take another look at some of the constructions you
    had in your first post to have any hope of making room for the 'r' in 'Francois'.
    I think your final solution will incorporate the new 'K/is', the old 'ari/nco',
    and some way of packing 'ra' into 'n'.

  body: "I agree with cerulean that the \"r\" is getting a bit lost. I know that it
    is difficult to work around but the flourish at the end of Karin is a bit confusing.
    I know that you need it for Francois. I recently designed a tattoo for myself
    using my two daughters names. It is a bit different because the names are stacked.
    Each name is an ambigram, so you read it one way it says Kendall/Kylie. The other
    way it says Kylie Kendall. Just another way to think about it. Good Luck! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KENDALL_KYLIE_TATTOO1.gif]"
