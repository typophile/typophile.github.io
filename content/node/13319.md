  cursory glance on the site I couldn't find it. \r\n\r\nI have set up a very rudimentary
  set of Open Type features for a typeface I am working on, but every time I try to
  compile it, I get errors. It gives me an 'unspecified' error in the error log, or
  it says 'aborting because of error'.\r\n\r\nI have read the manual multiple times
  and cannot identify the problem, I also double checked my syntax in the scripting
  panel [open type features panel] and everything seems to be correct.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any suggestions? I know this is a rather vague request, but I am at
  a loss for what to do. Any help/advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

    them. May I email them to you?"

    the non-breaking space that the OT features didn't like when it tried to compile
    the coding. Very strange and I would have never found it on my own.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks Alan!!!"
