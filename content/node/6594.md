  a blinding gradient, but the red blood smear more than makes up for it! <BR> <BR><a

  body: '::shakes head:: <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to know the story behind it. What combination
    of factors yielded that conclusion? I think the red smear symbolizes the mourning
    of the old logo&#39;s passing. This seems to be a logo reinvention along the same
    lines as Northwestern&#39;s; the desire for newness colliding horribly with the
    desire to not change anything, producing a parody of the original logo&#39;s logic.'

  body: Joe they are targeting the same audience. Why reinvent the wheel. Design wise
    it hurts to look at them but the companies only care about their investors and
    the bottom line. Its not about taste, its about the culture of these chains. Appeal
    to the lowest common denominator.

  body: Actually the hippest of these companies &#40;Target&#41; started <BR>a trend
    that places importance on Design ... it&#39;s pervasive. <BR>The other companies
    are merely jumping on the Target wagon, which <BR>is being driven by ... Design
    and Designers of all things. <BR> <BR>Kristin Dooley of MegaCorp. can discuss
    this more. <BR>But in my opinion, appealing to the LCD is not an <BR>accurate
    description of what&#39;s happening in this particular <BR>retailing arena. <BR>
    <BR>btw,  <BR>Target &#62; WalMart &#62; KMart are mass-merchant <BR>retailers,
    while Sears is in a class called Mid-Tier. <BR> <BR>Sears also isn&#39;t typically
    a Big Box retailer ... it&#39;s more <BR>tied to malls. <BR> <BR>bj

    that&#39;s clearly how/why Target took the move it did. Instead of competing with
    Wal-Mart &#40;which, in many ways, is actually selling &#39;cheap&#39; above anything
    else&#41;, Target decided to differentiate itself &#40;by selling &#39;design&#39;
    above anything else&#41;. <BR> <BR>The problem with Kmart is that it got stuck
    in the middle and didn&#39;t know what to do. They brought in Martha, but left
    the rest of the store looking like an outdated Wal-Mart. They went with the incredibly
    cheasy &#39;big k&#39; look for a while, and now their latest print ads are mirroring
    target again. They&#39;re just running in circles.'

  body: Armin, that&#39;s what I meant by &#34;producing a parody of the original
    logo&#39;s logic&#34;. They ape the style without the structural finesse &#40;or
    thought&#41; of the original. <BR> <BR>Target certainly differentiates, but I
    think it&#39;s only doing that because it needs to have a competition point with
    Walmart and is trying to strike at the people &#40;like many of us&#41; who point
    up their noses concerning Walmart, which is essentially eating middle-America
    alive. My parents used to live in a town that was/is utterly commercially dominated
    by the Walmart. Go to a rural town that&#39;s slightly flagging economically,
    and you&#39;ll probably find a Walmart nearby. <BR> <BR>Kmart is, from what I
    gather, just winding itself down in preparation to become <a href="http://www.messenger-inquirer.com/features/business/7420234.htm">an
    investment company</a>, which benefits the stockholders, who are calling the shots.
    <BR> <BR>So, the image schizophrenia is probably partially a fast series of marketing
    gymnastics to drive the stock up as hard as they can before shifting over. Also,
    they probably don&#39;t have much in the way of a driving brand concept since
    they&#39;re on the way out anyway. Apparently, the Chairman of Kmart &#40;Ed Lampert&#41;
    is also spending time in the Sears offices as well...

  body: Ah, where would a marketing department be without someone to copy? Marketing
    research has fallen to the level of the TV network executives who look at other
    peoples &#34;numbers&#34; and assume copying their stuff is also going to copy
    their market share numbers. The falacy of statistics lies in the quick jump to
    a conclusion and making leaps beyond what the numbers really show.  Wallmart is
    making money because they moved the mountain to Mohamad.  They brought big city
    volume discounts to small town America.  Their logo did virtually nothing to ESTABLISH
    the brand, it only CARRIES the brand. <BR>Sears did a similar thing years ago
    with catalogue sales but sat on their laurels and ignored customer service. <BR>

  body: '&#34;New Sears Logo Fresher and Friendlier&#34; <BR> <BR>The Sears logo gets
    freshened up. Starting today you will notice a difference in the Sears logo. The
    logo takes on a fresher and friendlier appearance with brighter blue, lower case
    letters and a red arc that adds a colorful dimension. This look evokes a more
    modern stylish feel. As a focused retail and related services company, poised
    for profitable growth, the logo gives our retail landscape a more inviting look
    while still capturing the trust and reliability for which Sears is known.  <BR>
    <BR>Marketing research &#40;involving feedback from 600 customers in ten markets&#41;
    revealed that the existing Sears logo was consistently perceived as trustworthy
    and reliable. Because of this feedback, the decision was made not to deviate too
    far from our current logo.  <BR> <BR>This logo is available for internal use from
    the marketing intranet site. When using the Sears logo refer to the guidelines
    on this site. Internally the direction is to change the logo only on new orders
    and otherwise to use up existing products or paper.  <BR> <BR>The new Sears logo
    is only the fourth in the company&#39;s 118-year history, succeeding the Sears
    script name in a rectangle introduced in 1963 and used for more than 20 years
    and the circular design from the 1950s.'
