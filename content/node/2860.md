  body: Hi, <BR> <BR>This is a very nice first effort, if I read your post correctly.
    It appears that your Uppercase &#34;S&#34; is falling over to the right. The lowercase
    &#34;g&#34; seems too wide and the bowl is too large. I would give the &#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;p&#34; more space where the top of the bowl meets the vertical stroke.
    There also appear to be some spacing issues, the uppercase &#34;P&#34; for example.  Otherwise,
    a very nice start. Reminds me a little of Antique Olive.

    And the weight is off: too dark for a Regular and a bit light for a Bold. Unless
    the intention is setting small text &#40;~7 point&#41;, in which case the color
    is fine for a Regular, but then the spacing is a bit tight overall. <BR> <BR>hhp
