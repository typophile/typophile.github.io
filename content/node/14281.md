  good time playing some drinking games etc. I go to fill up my cup with more beer
  and when I'm done I look up at the guy next in line and what do I see? <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=7&displayfontid=LH.117578.0.0&fontRendererText=Balls\">Punchcut's
  Pump</a> setting the word Balls across the front of his shirt. I ALMOST said something
  but decided to restrain myself. The ad over there --------> worked FontShop!! Ok
  maybe you don't care but I had to tell SOMEONE! :)\r\n\r\n-Dave"

  body: FYI, Pump does not belong to [[Punchcut]]. This typeface was designed by Philip
    Kelly and is a part of the Linotype library (also available through FontShop,
    of course).

  body: You shall soon get quite used to making associations through nearly every
    typeface you see, I suppose this is part of the joys of being a [[Typophile]].
    I often make a fool of myself by thinking out loud and telling random, non-fonty
    people that their shirt displays a particular typeface (I can recall one time
    when I was giving a brief history on the fraktur style to a boy I had a crush
    on. Not highly recommended). This type of ice-breaker generally doesn't get the
    party started, but rather ends it abruptly. :)

  body: "Zara, when I met my girlfriend a few years ago, I spent half the night talking
    about hand lettering in Cologne (we met at a party, which was neither a party
    for designers, nor in Cologne\u2026). She agreed to go out with me later, but
    her roommate was totally against it because I seemed like a total dork (little
    did she know that I am, in fact, a total dork).\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    to Pump: http://www.fontshop.com/iam/search.cfm because when you mouse over the
    name of the person below it (which I thought was the designer it says ''www.punchcut.com'')
    my mistake though! I don''t want to give false credit!'

    was more of a joke than anything (btw, my jokes aren't funny. Perhaps I should
    start using more emoticons. eeww) If someone can't dig words like \"kerning\"
    and \"unicode,\" then they are missing out. <em>--> Funny, ha ha :) :) :), Come

  body: Zara, I understood you. On the topic of mixing type and dates, I actually
    really love any opportunity to go to a  movie with friends and geek over the opening
    title sequence ... quickly trying to id the type. My type friends and I giggle,
    whereas my not-type friends roll their eyes at me and pretend they don't know
    me.
