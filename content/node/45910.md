body: "Hi,\r\nCan anyone help me with this font?\r\nI don't know if it's digitalized
  font even. It reminds me a little bit of Garamond Condensed Bold that American Apparel
  uses but also a little bit of ITC Clearface. Anyone have any better suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/herb_lubalin_123_5340.jpg]"

    can't find it online anyway), but the original was called Trooper Roman.
