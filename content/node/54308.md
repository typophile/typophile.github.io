  body: "Thanks all!!!\r\n\r\nI saw my shadow which means 6 more weeks of winter.
    On the plus side one of my groundhog brethren bit Mayor Bloomberg on the finger.
    Props, bro!\r\n\r\nA bit of trivia that Chuck didn't know when he made the card:
    the Beatles arrived in NY just 5 days after I was born. I am told that I watched
    them on Ed Sullivan when I was a week old. Can't say I remember that, but as a
    kid I had blue meanie posters up in my room. Loved Yellow Submarine. "
