  body: "For artistic and theoretical purposes Typographic Systems is the best I have
    seen. I like it because it is packed with examples and covers a wide range of
    layout possibilities.\r\n\r\nElam has another book called Grid Systems, which
    is also useful and is the better seller of the two.\r\n\r\nTimothy Samara has
    some good books, among them <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Making-Breaking-Grid-Graphic-Workshop/dp/1592531253\">Making
    and Breaking the Grid</a>.\r\n"
