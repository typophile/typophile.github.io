body: Anyone interested in typefaces used on movie posters go check out <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/">Unzipped</a>,
  my blog on the FontShop BeNeLux website. The <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/index.php?l=11">Screenfonts</a>
  feature has been a mainstay throughout my first year, and now I just published the
  <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=183">first English language episode</a>.
  This will be fortnightly feature.

  body: "Knowing you, I am sure it's an interesting site, but I need a Flash Plug-in
    to see it that I cannot use with my Mac OS (9.2). Why isn't it possible to have
    content without the use of the newest Flash?\r\n\r\nDo animated banners (or whatever)
    really make a site more useful to anyone? This obsolescence syndrome is infuriatingly
    unnecessary, in my opinion -- but of course, my reason for feeling this way is
    obvious.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
