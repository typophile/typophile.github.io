body: "All,\r\n\r\nI see lots of Golden Type and Italian Old Style influence in Parkinson,
  and at the same time it has a lot of attitude, which I love. But it's clearly a
  display face; I couldn't get it to work as body text for a newsletter-type publication.
  So I'm looking for its partner(s).\r\n\r\nI know that people generally say that
  a sans isn't good for body text, unless it's a certain kind of sans. Here's Frutiger
  as body-text, obviously: http://www.fonts.com/browse/designers/jim-parkinson --
  and I'm just a big fan of Frutiger in general. (Avenir is a close second.)\r\n\r\nThus,
  the question, posed in the Subject: what <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/\">Frutiger</a>-esque
  sans might you know of that shares some features or DNA with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/parkinson/\">Parkinson</a>
  so as to make it a good, toned-down-but-compatible companion to it? And while we're
  at it, would you hazard an opinion about a serif text face to complete the triumvirate?\r\n\r\nTitling/Display:
  Parkinson\r\nWeb text / print captions: sans\r\nprint (newsletter) body text: serif\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks."

  body: "I like Frutiger too. But all his sans-serifs, maybe apart from Vectora, are
    just so incredibly overused. So, since you like Avenir and Hrant likes Font Bureau
    \u2013 how about Apres? http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Apres/\r\nAlso available
    as Apres RE for small sizes on Screen. \r\nhttp://www.webtype.com/font/apresre-family/\r\n\r\nBy

    Electra?"

    Recently ditched the few old <em>Rolling Stone</em>s I had around. They used to
    use some cut of Kennerly in their body text. I think Joe Hutchinson was looking
    to replace that at one point, but I don\u2019t recall if it ever happened. Been
    a while since I looked closely at a copy. \r\n\r\nActually, now that I think more
    about it, I believe they might have moved to Miller Text when they made the change
    to the smaller format. I always thought they should have tried out FB\u2019s Eldorado."

    as a tripling. Turns out I don't think Goodchild and Parkinson are similar enough
    to conflict with one another. Goodchild might not have the \"mood\" I'm looking
    for, but it's unfussy, plainly communicative, and soooo clean, and I'm starting
    to suspect that I'm trying way, way too hard.\r\n\r\nNot that I'm expecting anyone
