  body: "I use Epson, so this might not apply, but I'll give it a go anyway.\r\n\r\nWhen
    printing from InDesign I klick the \"printer\" button in the print dialogue window
    to get to the printer specific settings. There I choose the best quality print
    and appropriate paper. The difference in quality between printing with speedy
    poorer quality and the slower best one is obvious with my printer.\r\n\r\nDo you
    have the same problem when printing from PDFs? If thay come out better, you could
    perhaps make a PDF first, and then print?"

  body: "I haven't tested by exporting it to PDF first went strait from InDesign to
    the printer with best quality(not a speedy print) so it should have delivered
    the best quality which the printer in general should deliver.\r\n\r\nDoesnt CMYK
    play a part in this? doesn't converting to a press PDF automatically convert the
    colors to CMYK? I believe so but not sure.\r\n "

  body: Disable Colormanagement in the printer software. Let InDesign take care of
    that and choose the right printer output profile (should be installed together
    w the printer software).

    I have, when i install an application the first thing i do is go through the preferences
    thorough as well as the export dialogs.\r\n\r\n<strong>bert_vanderveen</strong>\r\nThanks
    for that advice.\r\n"

  body: "Most inkjetprinters deal much better with RGB images. Because either the
    printer driver converts it, or the program from which you print.\r\n\r\nCMYK has
    quite a poor color range, so also color profiles can be an issue, as bert vanderveen
    already mentioned. So don't use Euroscale Coated V2 or anything for your inkjet
    printer, since inkjet printers usually have a larger color range then offset-printing.\r\n\r\nBut
    also make sure you have at least somewhat calibrated your screen (a quick eye-calibration
    with Adobe Gamma for example), so that you're sure that the black that you see
    on your screen actually is black."
