  body: 'I have looked thru thousands and thousands of fonts from my fonts. I have
    emailed typographic companies. I used all the bowfin resources, whatthefont etc..
    Any Suggestions would be helpful.. Its Not bodoni.. Its Not Arrus.. Closest I
    have found is Arepo or Kartago or even Horley but the "T" and the "L" are not
    close enough.. This was used by a small company that would''nt have had the budget
    for a custom font.. and they don''t know where it came from. '

  body: "Dennis, I know you have more letters than these four (you've showed me the
    full sample), but could you copy some of the other letters to give a more complete
    sample without revealing your client's identity?\r\n\r\n[Dennis and I have also
    looked through Dafonts for freebies, and found nothing similar in categories we
    would expect it to be in.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    tried Identifont with no success. I think this is from an amateur designer, or
    a very small foundry.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I was searching Modern Serifs at FontPool and came across <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/bergsland-engravers-pro/\">Bergsland
    Engraver's Pro</a>. Notice the way the serifs flare, and note the similarity in
    the R. The letters have been vertically stretched or 'squooshed' and possibly
    lightened by adding a white stroke. Add to that the way the letters could have
    been affected by scanning (your sample is from a scan you said), and I think this
    might be very close. The stretching could have exaggerated the E middle serif
    for example.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
