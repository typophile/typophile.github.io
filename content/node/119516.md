body: "Hi everybody! I am happy to announce the release of Cavatina: an experimental
  font for musical notation. It is the result of two years of work in design and programming.\r\n\r\nCavatina
  is my misuse (to put it nicely) of the OpenType font architecture, inspired by Travis
  Kochel's FF Chartwell. Similarly, the font relies on contextual alternates and ligatures
  to take care of the formatting and allow the support of a wide range of musical
  grammar. Among others, it is possible to write over four octaves of different notes,
  key and time signatures, barlines, accidentals, articulations as well as ornamentation,
  providing a system robust enough to allow fast musical composition. Additionally,
  I have written an open-source converter that translates the Cavatina text files
  to MIDI and MusicXML. A browser based text editor with integrated MIDI playback
  is also provided for the majority of those who don\u2019t have a Mac.\r\n\r\nWithout
  any further talk, go check out the website: <a href=\"http://cavatinafont.com\">cavatinafont.com</a>.\r\nTo
  test the font you can go through the <a href=\"http://cavatinafont.com/quickstart.html\">quick
  start</a>. You don\u2019t have to be a musician to understand how it works.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web-promo-1_6202.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web-promo-2_4803.png]\r\n\r\nTell
  me what you think!"

  body: Looks like a great concept! If musicians can cut the time to write their own
    music, this is a excellent starting point for anyone learning to compose their
    own music. P.S. Keep up the good work!

  body: "Hi I sent this to my musician friends, although I am not one myself. I tested
    it briefly just enough to realise the amount of work and ingenuity that it must
    have taken you to \"mis\"-use OT and with such apparent success. Congratulations.
    \ \r\nMay I suggest that when you promote it you make the image of the notes more
    prominent than the font name, lest people think it is just another letter font.\r\nI
    'misused' OT (in a much less demanding way than to create notation)  when I created
    a font to type diagrams for my physics paper:  http://vladimirtamari.com/beautiful_universe_font.html\r\nGood
    luck!"

    for non-designers? (Nice to see another experimental font for a technical purpose
    ;-)"

  body: "Lex \r\nPerhaps you can show a photo or collage of a hand typing on the keyboard
    and on the screen a note appearing on the staves?  BTW did you use VOLT to create
    the OT behaviour? Putting the notes on different heights is not technically different
    than what Arabic font designers do (as I did) to adjust the height of diacritical
    marks (and leaving the bearing width at zero."

    since the <code>mark</code> and <code>mset</code> feature tags seem to currently
    have very limited support. It\u2019s all common <code>liga</code> and <code>calt</code>
    GSUB rules."

  body: Hmm mark and mark on mark are standard features necessary for displaying Arabic
    diacritical marks.  I never heard  anything about limited support for them!

  body: Nice! Does it align well with text? Does using it to include short snippets
    of music in text passages (e.g. in musicology articles) make sense?

  body: "Vladimir: you are so right. You will very probably see those features in
    the next implementation.\r\n\r\nJohan: The vertical metrics were set to allow
    systems of staves without further adjustment. In this sample, I\u2019ve simulated
    a 24/29 setting:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Inline Test_5373.png]"

  body: Lex I am no authority on OT features, but using VOLT it is easy to change
    the positions of various elements. But after writing my comment I realised that
    not all software implement Arabic features (including marks) . For example Open
    Office does not display Arabic (right-to left text) correctly. Do try different
    ways..but 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it!" ;)
