body: "Not sure what use this baby is (apologies to Ben Franklin), but Windows XP
  and Vista have a built-in program called Private Character Editor that lets you
  create a glyph, or sets of glyphs, and save them as Unicode characters in the range
  from E000 to F8F0. The characters can be made available to all your installed fonts
  or to just one font. You create the glyphs as bitmaps on a 64x64 grid using a tool
  set similar to the MS Paint program.\r\n\r\nThe editor doesn't appear anywhere in
  the Start menu as far as I can tell; you have to click <strong>Start > Run</strong>
  and type <strong>eudcedit</strong>.\r\n\r\n(Later edit: Sorry, that should have
  been Private, not Personal. I changed the title and text accordingly.)"

    chracters not encoded in Unicode such as people''s names. In general the tool
    should be avoided. '
