  initially found in ethnic/indigenous contexts (er, pardon that clumsy terminology?).
  \r\nAn example I was recently introduced to is the Churchward \"Maori\" face (thanks
  to David Bennewith at the Jan van Eyck Academie). Someone also mentioned a face
  based on Basque carvings.\r\nEssentially I am looking to start a project that explores
  the ways type designers employ these sorts of forms (consciously or intuitively?)
  and what the implications of this could be in a larger context? Any literature on
  the subject or leads on specific faces or designers would be much appreciated. \r\nThanks
  v much\r\n"

    Inuit</a> is a good example of this. There are also a number of faux-Arabic, Hebrew,
    Chinese/Japanese, Sanskrit, etc. types that have been mentioned on Typophile.
    Try searching Typophile on Google (limit the search to just Typophile.com in Advanced
    Search) for these topics; they shouldn't be too hard to find.\r\n\r\nAside from
    these typefaces that incorporate \"appropriated forms,\" there are a number of
    types that are sympathetic to non-Western scripts. A number of the typefaces coming
    out of the University of Reading start with the idea of mating a Roman type with
    another alphabet/script. See the newest ones <a href=http://typefacedesign.org/>here</a>;
    see Skolar and Vesper of the new ones, and look at some past PDFs for other examples.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    an interesting article that may be applicable is <a href=http://www.studio-gs.com/neuland.html>this
    one</a> about the stereotypes that typefaces come to embody.\r\n\r\nThis looks
    like a really interesting project: I'll look forward to see what you produce."

  body: "This from the brief biography of Joseph Churchward, in the Chank PDF for
    his faces:\r\n\"Mr. Churchward\u2019s design interests reflect his rich ethnic
    heritage in Chinese, Tongan, Scottish, English, and Samoan cultures,\r\nas well
    as the influences of his surroundings in New Zealand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Appropriated\"
    would seem to be too loaded a word to describe his work."

    See his <a href=http://www.klim.co.nz/custom_hoko.php>Hokotohu</a> and lettering
    for <a href=http://www.klim.co.nz/lettering_srp.php>Strange Resting Places</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in case Nick seized on something that others are thinking, I don't see the \"appropriation\"
    as a bad thing; I'm just thinking about Roman letterforms taking inspiration from
    other scripts."

  body: "My Nyala typeface for Microsoft might be of interest. In this case, the design
    of the Latin was intended to harmonise visually with the traditional Ethiopic
    Ge\u2018ez script: it is an Ethiopic typeface that supports Latin text, rather
    than a bi-script design. This being the case, I felt I had some freedom in interpreting
    some of the lesser-used punctuation characters like the dagger, bullet, curly
    braces, etc. The dagger, for instance, is based on the hilt design of an Ethiopian
    sword I saw, while the bullet and the cross ornament are based on traditional
    Ethiopian patterns.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nyalapunc_4345.gif]"
