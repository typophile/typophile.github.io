body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>For research I opened Tarzana &#40;Suzanna Licko&#41; en Meta
  &#40;Erik Spiekerman&#41; to see how they finished up there typefaces. <BR>I saw
  that they put all the glyph-points on whole coordinates. Is this usual if you want
  to make a &#39;good&#39; type? <BR>My points are now ad random in place. I will
  correct this if it makes the font better. Any thoughts on this subject? <BR> <BR>I
  saw on a laserwriter print I made that some characters look thicker. Can it be this
  has to do with the gridfitting? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren

  body: Postscript typefaces only work with rounded numbers for coordinates, <BR>so
    any PS T1 font will have &#34;whole&#34; coordinates. <BR>But, personally, I think
    you really should avoid working with non-rounded <BR>numbers. You get more focused
    on what you&#39;re doing. IMHO.

  body: Yes, the unavoidable eventual rounding that happens when you output your font
    can introduce unwanted distortions that you can often work around if you take
    the rounding problem head-on. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: In a design like this, using non-integer points will definitely cause a headache.
    As pointed out, when a Postscript Type 1 font is generated from this data, all
    those coordinates will be rounded. The PS T1 spec requires coordinates as integers.  <BR>
    <BR>This will inevitably lead to grief as, for instance, your top horizontal will
    become narrower and your bottom will become wider. <BR> <BR>BTW, at high-resolution
    2540 dpi output, your type would have to be set at 57 pt or larger before the
    rasterizer could actually render the difference of 0.5 em unit. Lower-resolution
    output would need to be even larger. <BR> <BR>Do as James says and use the Points
    &#62; Align to Points feature. I also recommend setting File &#62; Preferences
    &#62; Editing Behavior so that Grid spacing = 1 em unit &#40;I think that might
    be the default, but check&#41;. Then turn on View &#62; Snap to Grid. This will
    keep your point placement on the whole numbers. <BR> <BR>Or use FontLab. <BR>

  body: thanks guys. I had the feeling something was not right when I made the laserprint.
    I will change my settings. <BR> <BR>I use FL to hint my typeface. For creation
    I like FOG more. It&#39;s Macromedia, there logic is how it should be with a lot
    of software. <BR> <BR>Ren
