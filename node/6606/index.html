<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>OK. Having some trouble with coming up with a lockup for this logo. I think the 3rd one on the right works the best in both contexts, but I am not happy with stacking the type to the right. <br> <br>I like putting it underneath logotype, but then it gets lost on the 1st sketch, and on the 2nd sketch I am not sure what to have extend beyond the right of the logotype. <br> <br>Probably what will work best is a combination of 1 and 3. Stack the type on the right when small, position it all underneath when big. <br> <br>But I want see what you all have to say. <br> <br>CAN is a network of creative professionals engaged in multimedia politically-focussed projects. A lot of their work will be for broadcast, some for print and web. <br> <br>Thanks for your help. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48608.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry Peter, but until I read your last paragraph I thought that was a cut off E A and D sort of down the middle. It doesn't read to me. If you don't include the full name it makes no sense at all. Its just my opinion</div>

<div class=commentbody>One last thought CAN is often used in the term "In the can" meaning inactive, not a good name for a pro-active group.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> <br> <br>definitely "creative action network" has to be in the lockup. I was just wanting feedback on better ways to work this type in with the logotype.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello Peter <br> <br>I love the concept that the same shape can create three letters through rotation, but i have to agree with Daniel that without the subtitle, CAN is difficult to be read. On the other hand i think CAN is positive (though i am not familiar with the common american language) because the verb "can" neans anything but impossibility. <br> <br>But as you said Peter you asked for the type... <br>I think the best thing is -as you said- to be flexible with it, not just underneath or right, but also column underneath, depending on where and how big your logo is. <br> <br>Also aesthetically i would recommend to use a much bigger type in lc and extra light in the same row with CAN (maybe even in the same x-height) or a column underneath, so it will gently brake your constructivistic boldness. <br> <br>A last comment: if you can still touch the logo i think it would be intersting to put a small square or dot or anything upper and right of N so to help the legibility and also with a bright color there you could express energy and activity -like coming out of CAN. Hope that i helped. <br> <br>christos</div>

<div class=commentbody>"One last thought CAN is often used in the term "In the can" meaning inactive" <br> <br>And it also means 'can' as in 'can do' which is perfect for this type of org, IMHO. <br> <br>I can read the 'CAN' OK. The full name certainly helps as well. <br> <br>I actually prefer the second one. <br> <br>HAve you tried stacking the type underneath letting the words take the full width? That would allow you to increas the size of the ACTION word which might be a nice emphasis</div>

<div class=commentbody>Christos, thanks for the feedback. one thing I like about the letterforms being simliar is that it hits home this idea of network, similar elements coming together to make something. also makes for interesting humanoidal patters. <br> <br>the idea of pairing a light sans is a good one. I am liking some of those executions. stacking isn't working though. maybe I am not doing it correctly. <br> <br>I am liking the frame idea though. could make for a strong branding element if i left-align and use it like a wrapper of sorts. <br> <br>thoughts? thanks for your help guys. <br> <br>sketches: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48721.gif alt> <br> <br>what i am liking: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48722.gif alt> <br> <br>and funky pattern effect: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48723.gif alt></div>
