  body: Yes, a booklet about designing type, the entire text of which was completely
    handwritten. Quite a sense of humor, that Dwiggins. ;-)

  body: But Catich, I believe, wasn't writing about type design. There are quite a
    lot of books on calligraphy and other kinds of lettering that are reproduced from
    manuscript. But surely few on the subject of type, and those, if the two so far
    listed are typical, epistolary.

  body: It's a facsimile of the original letter, along with a redundant typeset transcript,
    but the letter is really a formal manuscript, not a typical epistle.

  body: "John, this isn\u2019t \u201Ca booklet about designing type, the entire text
    of which was completely handwritten,\u201D but it is still in the same universe,
    I think:\r\n\r\nEdward Johnston, Mark Argetsinger, David Pankow: <em>Thinking
    in script</em> http://carypress.rit.edu/publications/books/thinking-script.html\r\n\r\nThis
    is a letter from Edward Johnston to Paul Standard, reproduced by the RIT Cary
    Arts Press in facsimile\u2014in book form, instead of letter sheets. It is a quite
    nice little thing."
