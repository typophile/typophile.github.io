body: "Hi all. This is a message mostly directed to 'Haag' but also to anyone else
  who might help. About a month ago I purchased 'Foco' for a corporate job but unfortunately
  it was never used. \r\n\r\nNow I'm doing a book on New Zealand Maori facial tatoos,
  called Moko's. The book explores both traditional and modern interpretations of
  Moko design. It's both an academic text as well as a book of beautiful modern portraits
  (like the one attached).\r\n\r\nFoco is perfect as an alternate text font, for the
  purposes of this job it complements the subject but also works well paired with
  Plantin. Unfortunately it has no Italic forms (or none that I can find anywhere
  online). I desperately want to use this font but need an Italic for us to proceed
  as the book 272 pages.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help? Unfortunately this is an urgent request
  as we are presenting a blad in the next week. \r\n\r\nIf there isn't an italic version
  then can someone suggest an appropriate alternative that posesses the same character
  and tone.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nBevan.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MauMoko_4445.jpg]"

    body: "Thanks for your help. They look like great alternatives. I bought Omnes
      for another job so I'm a little apprehensive about using it again so soon though
      it is a fantastic font.\r\n\r\nAny idea if there is in fact an Italic version
      of Foco? I read some old forum posts (2004) where 'Haag' was getting feedback
      on the early iterations of what would be FH Foco. There was a post regarding
      a proposed Italic but the trail dries up there.\r\n\r\nAny exta help would be
      great."

    body: Thanks, yeah that was the first thing I tried to do but his profile says
      he's not accepting emails so I'm at a little bit of a loss.

      with this forum. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot Tiffany for contacting me in private.\r\nI
      already changed my account settings to allow other users to contact me (it was
      a shame the way it was ;)\r\n\r\nI already answered Bevan in private, but considering
      all you guys in this threat, I'll clarify:\r\n\r\nFoco doesn't have italics,
      yet. It was released in partnership with DaltonMaag and designing them is one
      of our goals... but I'm sorry to say that it won't happen soon.\r\n\r\n\"see
      ya\" all around ;)"

    & Foco work together to compliment the deep spiritual nature of Moko? I am sure
    you have a good understanding of typography (seven is a top design firm) and your
    reasoning is sound\u2014but it is nice to hear it from the horses mouth, as it
    were!\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

    body: "Hi Kris. Plantin & Foco have a very similar line colour which was the primary
      reason for the pairing. As this is primarily an academic text (although by nature
      of the subject it will no doubt become a coffee table book), I need to pair
      two fonts that would occupy the same negative space so the change in type face
      doesn't interupt the reader.\r\n\r\nPlantin is favourite of mine, it was a selfish
      choice. \r\n\r\nFoco possess some very nice subtlities in the tails and feet.
      To me, and that is not to say this is fact, it seemed sympathetic to Maori line.
      It's a bit of a stretch but it just seem to work. \r\n\r\nTo be fair post-rationalising
      is for clients. There's something to be said when things 'just work' together.
      So I apologise if you were after a deeper meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n"
