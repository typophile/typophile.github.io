    of letter shapes. \r\n\r\nPerhaps offer the dieline design over at thedieline
    dot com, or to some such similar forum."

  body: Is this forum just for design of letter shapes? In my experience it has generally
    been used for all sorts of typographic design in addition to type design. Which
    is not to say that packaging dielines are necessarily suitable.

    that too ...and what is design of letter shapes if not type design? Is not type
    design the design of letter shapes?"

  body: "April, I'd suggest you post the tutorial in a more suitable forum or on a
    private web page. And then post a link here if you think folks would be interested.
    \r\n\r\nHowever I suspect this account may turn out to be a spammer. Someone in
    China named \"April\" who's photo is a common web image and who's very first post
    is a request to post off-topic material?"
