  body: i developed this face for screenblast a couple of years back. this is not
    a typeface which should be obvious, it is a custom trademark. so the type is built
    to be a display not a typeface or &#34;font&#34;. these are the only letters that
    exist though i think sony has developed a whole face for it now which i had no
    part in. this was a very bad idea on their part being that this type of display
    face should be offset by a more neutral typeface. anyway there you have it mystery
    solved. <BR>

    you here. We were all laughing at your slam of the design when I noticed your
    name. Funny how small the world is. <BR>Cheers

  body: Jay -- Hmm. Yeah. It reads as a slam. Sorry. It was supposed to read more
    along the lines of &#34;dominatrix having her way with the type&#34;. Which for
    me, is funny, but it doesn&#39;t read that way. Sorry. And anyway. I just said
    &#34;it could be...&#34;.  <BR> <BR>John -- Do you still have my books?
