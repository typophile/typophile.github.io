    \r\nWhat kind of atmosphere are you looking for? Dreamy and pondering like the
    subject or more straight-forward and clear-cut like your technique?"

  body: I think Estilo Text by DSTYPE would fit nicely, as it's soft, yet clean. Also
    Bello or Liza by Underware would be nice, more expressive complement.

  body: "Thank you so much kind people for answering me :)\r\nThis is for my online
    portfolio (so not a standalone singular illustration) I am trying to come up with
    a good logo that compliments this style but can stand on it's own too. So the
    font is paramount. \r\n\r\nI love Bello and Liza - thank you very much - You were
    on my wavelength (very reassuring for me) I was looking at coffee service too
    which is similar (but less expensive - sorry still experimenting so buying expensive
    fonts now might be unwise)\r\n\r\nI have been looking at a more 1950's Americana
    approach and have been thinking of creating a badge style logo similar to baseball
    badges.  I really love this logo (although the G is a bit J like). I hope this
    concept works with the style  - you may see me posting on the critique board when
    I have something worth showing :)\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help :)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/all-stars_5516.gif]"

  body: "Interesting, Nick \u2013 before reading the replies, I was spontaneously
    thinking of one of yours too, but not a script: <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/bodoni.html\">Bodoni
    Egyptian</a>. It's monoline, and it rides that fine line between clean/sharp and
    handmade/slightly quirky. I think it should be an excellent match. (After reading
    the other replies, I'm thinking I'm probably alone in this corner of the room,
    but figured I'd say it anyway. :)"

  body: "Sorry, retro doesn't jive. I also think you should go with a monoline, to
    match that quality in your illustration.\r\nMy script <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/handsome.html
    \">Handsome</a> might fit the bill: its different weights would allow adjustment
    of type size and weight to the illustrative line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Nina. Yes, Bodoni Egyptian is a strict monoline, where all the stems
    and serifs, upper and lower case, are the same thickness.\r\n\r\nMatching type
    details to elements of layout such as illustrations and line rules has always
    interested me. I was a big fan of Robert Priest's <a href=\"http://www.antiqbook.com/books/bookinfo.phtml?nr=1197092170&l=en&searchform=\">Esquire</a>
    pages in the 1980s. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: You could pick up on the hard contour idea and go with an outline font for
    the logo. Three very different examples would be [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/ambule_outline_ot/|Ambule
    Outline]], [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/frutiger_capitalis_outline/|Frutiger
    Capitalis Outline]], or [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/linotype_rough_com_outline/|Rough
    Com Outline]]. (Of course, you could also easily stroke a different font to make
    an outline yourself.)

    slide 4 on process's Maple slide show for a \"running text situation\".\r\n\r\nPS
    Your \"baseball example\" overwhelms the vibe (vector style with charm, vintage
    japanese) of your illustration totally. Not a good idea in this case, i think.
    \r\nBut maybe you want go trashy (mixing styles of different decades obviously,
    ironically, brutally), but i think you don't want to go this way\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
