  in Abigail seems to really stand out as disjointed to the rest of the word. I can't
  seem to get it to look right.I have had ago at ammending the text but don't have
  much experience in this area so would welcome any advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/no1_4512.jpg]\r\n\r\nmy

    and took a screenshot.\r\n\r\nThe problem I see with this typeface (Linotype's
    <em>Kursivschrift Stehend</em>) being set so tightly is the white space between
    AB and AI that results from avoiding the serifs to overlap.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abigail_5130.png]\r\n\r\nHmm...?\r\n"
