  body: "While Vibe probably was using Vibration Gothic from Font Bureau at the time
    that cover was printed, I think the logo/flag* is/was a custom design based on
    Helvetica or a more recent sans. Vibration Gothic, like Titling Gothic, has the
    feel of an older, Akzidenz Grotesk-like sans.\r\n\r\n\r\n*We magazine designers
    prefer that to \"masthead,\" which is the listing of the staff/contributors."

    Sure, I secretly look down on them, but..."

    perhaps a custom blend done for the magazine. What first made me look at these
    was the font Rolloglide (shown [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide03.html|here]]
    in the Lined Fonts Guide)-- imagine a solid version of Rolloglide with the C (alt)
    from Gemini on the FontBros page.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
