body: Can anyone identify these? I tried to match them all day and made no progress.
  The last 2 are type styles I&#39;ve never used before so I wasn&#39;t really sure
  how to search. Are they horror, blacklettersans, comic or somthing else? Thanks!

  body: However, I know these teams, thes are from youth hockey teams and very few
    have the money to have someone do custom lettering. They usually utilize something
    already existing. The problem is that they need to modify and recreate parts of
    the logos and the league orgs change so much they don&#39;t know where they got
    the logos made or how they were made.

    <BR> <BR>Could be, but you can clearly make out that both the  <BR>second Blast
    and the Wolves logo are obviously done by  <BR>an unskilled person, so these are
    definitely custom made. <BR> <BR>The stroke morphology of the first Blast brush
    style logo  <BR>hint at a better quality job, and I agree with Grant that  <BR>Tim
    Donaldson&#39;s similar faces are your best bet unless we  <BR>can pinpoint the
    actual face. <BR> <BR>The BST looks quite professional too, but the shape of  <BR>the
    letters and how they interact with each other also  <BR>make me believe this was
    custom designed. As the three  <BR>characters are entirely made up of straight
    lines it could  <BR>be somebody examined an existing sports logo and  <BR>emulated
    the style.

  body: Right on Mike! Nice ID. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d never seen <a href="http://www.robotjohnny.com/">John
    Martz&#39; site</a> or his fonts before. Too bad his <a href="http://www.martz.ca/">illustration
    portfolio</a> is offline right now. I&#39;m curious about his other work.

  body: Awesome work guys! And you have one on me. The orgs told me they were sure
    they weren&#39;t hand lettered. But the boards change too often and original artwork
    and type aren&#39;t as important as the game of hockey! &#40;well, until they
    can&#39;t find them anymore...&#41; I suspect they hired them done by a custom
    sports logo company, but nobody remembers if they did. Good thing this is not
    for profit! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    around for a long time and <BR>several have aged quite well &#40;for freebies&#41;.
    Girls Are Wierd <BR>is pretty well known and used, and Bottled Fart remains a
    <BR>personal favorite. <BR> <BR>I love his requirement that commercial use entails
    payment <BR>in the form of a toy or an item from his Amazon.com wishlist! <BR><br>
