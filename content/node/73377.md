  body: Thank you! You definitely nailed the fonts used in the title. That O is so
    interesting! Do you happen to know what font is used in the tag "A Bibliophile
    Mystery"? It looks different to me.

  body: The script appears to be Troubadour. The open version of that old German metal
    font has been digitized as Rechtman. You can find some information and more known
    aliases in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/38718">this older thread</a>.
    I am not aware of a digital version that looks like your sample, i.e. a regular,
    non-open one. Maybe it has been customized.
