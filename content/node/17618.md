    such a list. Dalton Maag and Monotype UK both have very talented type designers
    on-staff.  '

    I keep saying 'one of these years', I'm really quite embarrassed about it. It's
    a matter of finding the time to devote the attention it needs.\r\n\r\nI see you're
    in London - I'm in the smoke at the end of the month if that's of interest to
    you?\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: Perhaps Nick. It's a shame you don't have a site. Of course, you want it right,
    but it wouldnt be the biggest deal to put something together. It would certainly
    help you with work.
