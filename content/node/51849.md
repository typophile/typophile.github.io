  body: "Hello Brian and welcome to Typophile. We've had a few threads on this topic
    in recent times. Typophile's search feature is about as functional as a door with
    no hinges and no  handle, so the only way you can locate these threads is by way
    of Google search.\r\n\r\nGive google your search terms and after the key words
    put \"+typophile\".\r\n\r\nThe other side to this coin involves non-disclosure
    between business partners, breach of trust and trade secrets. Generally, designers
    who sell their fonts thru outlets like Veer, T-26, P22, Myfonts, Font Bros et
    al, avoid disclosing details of their business experience with these vendors because
    it constitutes breach of the usual non-disclosure agreement (contract) between
    font maker & vendor. Disclosing to the general public what these companies are
    like to deal with is (in my professional opinion) a betrayal of the trust and
    confidence they extend to independent font makers. \r\n\r\nFor example, my distributor,
    Myfonts, does not tell the whole world what I am like to deal with in private
    business dealings with them, and I don't tell the world what they are like in
    private business dealings, not just because personal stuff like that doesn't belong
    online, but because the contractual agreement which I signed and they signed stipulates
    that neither party shall disclose such information. And because that stuff is
    private and proprietary. Some areas of the business are all show n' tell, other
    areas are no go.\r\n\r\nAnyway, please don't let any of this put you off Typophile.
    Just giving you the strait dope.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    More like how one comes to have their fonts sold at Veer. Does Veer approach them?
    Do they have to submit something to Veer etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/47647"

    implication is that he wants to hear any stories font makers have had with vendors?
    I was working on that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if Skywalker only wants to know things like,
    \". . . how one comes to have their fonts sold at Veer. Does Veer approach them?
    Do they have to submit something to Veer etc.\" the best way of finding out, the
    most appropriate way, is for him to ask Veer, P22, T-26 et al, or look on their
    websites for information. It's common for vendors to offer that kind of general
    information up front.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
