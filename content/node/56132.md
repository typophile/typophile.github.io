  body: 'Yes apologies about the scan. I just had to rush down to local printing/scanning
    place and despite my request the staff seemed unable to scan anything properly,
    and would not let me do it myself. Enough to push me over the edge, will go pick
    up a scanner tonight. '

  body: I think it comes closest to 'trade gothic ltcond eighteen'. It seems to fit
    perfectly but cant confirm without a better resolution scan!
