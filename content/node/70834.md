  body: "Good question. I don\u2019t find anything about that in the manual and the
    font info dialog does not have a hinting section. For the case, that it is not
    possible to set the alignment zones with TypeTool, you can decompile the font
    with TTX and insert the zones manually. They are stored in the cff table.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;Private&gt;\r\nPrimary
    Zones (in this example you have four): &lt;BlueValues value=\"-250 -240 -10 0
    420 435 590 600\"/&gt;\r\nSecondary Zones (in this example you have two): &lt;OtherBlues
    value=\"460 470 570 580\"/&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nOther important hinting parameter:\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;BlueScale
    value=\"0.04\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;BlueShift value=\"7\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;BlueFuzz value=\"1\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;StdHW
    value=\"80\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;StdVW value=\"110\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;StemSnapH value=\"80
    90\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;StemSnapV value=\"70 110\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;ForceBold value=\"1\"/&gt;\r\n\u2026\r\n&lt;/Private&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nBut
    it would be odd, if you can set hints with TypeTool, but no alignment zones. Or
    can you autohint your font with TypeTool only? If yes, I recommend to autohint
    the font with the autohinting program belonging to the AFDKO.\r\n\r\nNo, you can
    edit hints with TypeTool. It would be very odd, if you can\u2019t edit alignment
    zones likewise."

  body: "But the AFDKO autohinting program is probably not setting the stem and blue
    values automatically, but expects, that they are present in the font. As far as
    I remember it only computes the glyph individual hints, but not the font global
    hinting parameters. I assume, that you can set the alignment zones and stem values
    also with FontForge.\r\n\r\nThe AFDKO contains a program, with the help of which
    you can compute the heights and depths of glyphs and the frequences of stem widths.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you are not experienced with the AFDKO, I recommend, that you first use TypeTool
    for autohinting. It probably is setting the stem width values automatically and
    (if it uses the same procedure as FontLab!) in my experience it does a relative
    good job there. And then you can use the AFDKO for regenerating (overwriting)
    the hints.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nHave a look at this: http://forum.fontlab.com/typetool/turn-off-blue-alignment-zones-t7007.0.html\r\n\r\nSeems
    to be, that at least displaying the alignment zones with TypeTool is undocumented."

    was under the impression that hinting was to do with the rendering on a computer

    font\r\n\r\nshould i consider fontforge? i cant afford the upgrade to fontlab
    right now"

  body: "<cite>i am just looking to be able to set a global overshoot per font</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    alignment zones are global. All glyphs, that are in a zone with their tops/bottoms
    are aligned to the same height/depth (in low resolutions).\r\n\r\nYou need different
    alignment zones for the capitals and small letters for example, where both groups
    share the same bottom zone. So you had three alignment zones in this case. Additionally
    you may need an alignment zone for the ascenders and descenders and small caps.
    Maybe also for certain groups of figures."

  body: "Does anybody know, if there is a way to unlock the alignment layer in TypeTool?
    The shortcut for viewing the layer is ctr-shift-z on Windows. That is undocumented
    but it is the same shortcut as in FontLab. But there is no default shortcut for
    unlocking the alignment layer in FontLab. So I wonder, whether the shortcuts are
    stored in the registry. If they are stored there, it is maybe possible to store
    a key with the unlocking shortcut in the registry for TypeTool. I cannot understand,
    that you can change the individual hints in TypeTool, but not the global hinting
    parameters.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBy the way, I dislike it, that the FontLab
    tools share the directory with the encoding files and other important files. I
    wish, that each program would store its data in its main installation directory
    only."
