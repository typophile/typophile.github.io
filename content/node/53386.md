body: "I was wondering if anyone could help me identify the typeface off of which
  this logo is based. The logo is from my school's literary sex magazine. I co-edit
  the satire page of the campus newspaper, and this week we're doing a parody of the
  magazine, so I'd like to make a parody logo, as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/opensexsurveyblue_6606.png]"

  body: Close, but on both Berthold and Monotype Baskerville, the top of the stem
    bends left a bit on both the p and the n.

  body: I contacted the designer, and as it turns out the logo is based on Academy
    Engraved. Apparently the logo that he so graciously designed for free was butchered
    by the design staff later in the process, so he was more than happy to help us
    parody it.
