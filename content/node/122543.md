  does anyone know this font and then something similar that is free for commercial
  use? Im struggling to find any good commercially free fonts for a client who doesn't
  want to pay anything for a typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This looks very close to <strong>Circular Bold</strong> available at Lineto:\r\nhttp://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/\r\n\"RESORT\"
    looks like an exact match while the same font could be customized for \"RHODE\".\r\n\r\nAbout
    the free fonts, tell your client that you contacted the font designer and he agrees
    to stay for a week on his resort but he doesn't want to pay anything for it. Sounds
    good?\r\nYou can also make an alternative proposal to recreate his logo using
    Comic Sans..."

  body: "Confirming Circular LL. Unfortunately, nothing approaching or even loosely
    similar. Circular is a grotesk, rather geometric and for the above lettering part
    of the /S could be approximated with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]]
    neither free though. In the same range of x-width, [[http://www.impallari.com/cabin|Cabin]],
    [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro|Source Sans]], [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lato|Lato]],
    [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=edmondsans|Edmondsans]] (donation-ware) and
    [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans|Open Sans]] are very good fonts
    but their design really differ from Circular and their main purpose is web (meaning
    not for print). A bit larger but more geometric, [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/raleway|Raleway]]
    and [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat|Montserrat]] are very good
    options to consider too.\r\nTrusted sources for free fonts: [[http://www.google.com/fonts|Google

  body: Adding to the above advice from Fivos and Ryuk, I would say that, as a designer,
    purchasing carefully chosen fonts is a needed investiment, that could/should be
    diluted among different clients.
