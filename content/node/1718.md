  body: I formally step down as the Type ID Board&#39;s head moderator <BR>to make
    room for the great Yves Peters, who long ago took <BR>my place anyway. <BR> <BR>&#40;I
    have turned email notification back on, however, now that <BR>I&#39;m settled
    in Stockholm. So I might be back in the game.&#41;
