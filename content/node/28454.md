  usually so I am a bit lost... Would someone point me to some really obvious mistakes
  that I might have made? It is not supposed to be a complete copy rather than a slight
  remake... The bottom serifs on the Vs are totally weird.. the M is also a problem...
  I also don't understand what is happening with the bottom serif on the L wich appears
  to be pointing backwards - it might be some kind of kerning... I am not sure...\r\nI
  will be very gratefull for any comments...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RudolfinumInWork_5984.jpg]"

  body: I'm thinking the V has serifs on either side of the bottom, not just on the
    right side. Also,  the serifs in the original may be less pronounced than in your
    re-creation.  It looks like you've exaggerated things a little bit. Looks good,
    though.

  body: "I think you're approaching this a bit too conventionally. The \"twisted\"
    serif on the \"L\" is a nice Art Nouveau element (and the bar of the \"F\" actually
    has it too). The old-school bottom of the \"V\" and the Elzevir \"M\" are also
    things I would keep.\r\n\r\nThen there's the spacing...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'The bent-in spike on the L was probably to help space the L tighter, and
    put less of a hole in the middle of the word. Adding to Brad''s suggestions: some
    of your serifs are less bracked than in the original. These should be consistent,
    as in the original, for a nice look. '

  body: "R has serifs on both sides of the tail. D, O and R curves look in the photo
    like \"superellipse\" or gradual curves, not straights with round corners. R is
    too round, D and O are too straight. \r\n\r\nI agree; there are some fun, irregular
    things about this carving. Observe them and decide which to keep and repeat, especially
    if you plan to finish the alphabet. Some features might change (F middle bar too
    short). I agree with Hrant that it should not be made more conventional or regular. "
