  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is my first proper post on this marvelous site.

Basically I want to design a business card to attract a bit more attention but i've been working on it for the last 3-4 hours and still have a absolutely nothing.

I've only recently got into typography in the last 2-3 months and have been reading up and study alot of articles & books.

I know what I want it to look like but it's hard to actually get it down because all the fonts i've had i've tried and i have no money at the minutes so I can't buy anymore at the minute.

I seem to work my best when i'm overly tired and my minds wandering because i come up with some crazy ideas and find it easier to put down but I can't do that now.

So i'm basically asking is there anything specific needed when you design in terms of conditions etc.

I was thinking of doing a wordsearch on the front of the business card and then on the back my details as words to find but after some research i've found it's been done before and i want to try something unique.

Thanks in advance.

I'm only a young 'un so take it easy on me :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would really consider the materials. Second, consider the fundamentals of design rather than trends and flash. I would guess that something clean and well constructed would be more likely to attract good attention.

If you haven't done so, try getting away from the computer.

Bring a sketchbook with you to the park or some other place you can relax and let your mind run.
