body: "EAU CLAIRE, WI \u2013 November 16, 2006 Font Diner, Inc. (www.fontdiner.com),
  a leading retro typography design firm, has announced the revival of the historic
  Filmotype, Inc. font library created in the 1950s and 1960's. \r\n\r\nFilmotype
  initially manufactured a simple manual phototype machine utilizing display typeface
  designs on 2-inch filmstrips. Additional films were sold to start-up typesetting
  companies in order to increase their product selection. Font Diner will create new
  digital versions of the Filmotype collection, recreating it to meet today's graphic
  design standards.\r\n\r\nStuart Sandler, President of Font Diner, Inc., intends
  to release the Filmotype library in OpenType format so the original designs can
  be fully realized with a dynamic feature set including alternate glyph forms and
  automatic substitutive ligatures. \"We are pleased and proud to reintroduce this
  unique font collection to an entirely new generation of graphic designers,\" says
  Sandler.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen a disturbing trend in our typeface design industry,\"
  he notes, \"as more fonts are being poorly digitized from vintage specimen showings.
  I believe it is important to protect and preserve the future of this historically
  important collection, numbering well over 500 unique designs.\"\r\n\r\nGraphic designers
  and the worldwide font community can order the newly designed typefaces at: www.filmotype.com.
  An illustrated history of the classic Filmotype brand has been carefully researched
  and is currently being written by Sandler. His work will accurately re-tell the
  evolution of the Filmotype Corporation, its founders and the significant contribution
  of Filmotype\u2122 to the typographic industry.\r\n\r\nFont Diner, Inc.\r\n\r\nStuart
  Sandler launched the Font Diner (www.fontdiner.com) foundry in 1996 and has become
  a major resource for retro design software products. He has created more than 400
  original typefaces for the graphic design industry and established a reputation
  as the premier retro display typography designer inspired by 1950s popular culture.
  Sandler added a second division to the Font Diner umbrella in 2004 (www.misterretro.com)
  that features Machine Wash Image Filters\u2122 and Snappy Hour\u2122 vector images.
  Earlier this year he expanded his corporation again thru a joint venture as publisher
  of high quality display typefaces (www.fontbros.com). Filmotype is a trademark of
  Font Diner, Inc."

  body: Stuart, this is such great news. I love seeing the rebirth of languishing
    collections of type. Just tell me you're going to charge more for your typefaces
    starting with this collection ... please.

  body: "In the Solotype Catalog of typefaces by DAN SOLO. There is 3 fonts in the
    book and 1 ive just learned of recently that id like know more about but very
    little is known about them. One is <strong>EARTH</strong>, <strong>Othello</strong>
    (Morris Benton) <strong>Bathysphere</strong> created by Gustav Schroeder and <strong>PREVIEW</strong>
    but it was renamed \"AIRLOCK\". \r\nId like to know the creator of those fonts
    and were can i find the alphabets of those fonts? And other information that is
    available. And if proper digital versions of specifically EARTH. And are those
    fonts going to be done in digital if anyone knows?\r\n\r\nAs there have been some
    good uploaded versions but none match the original Othello. Ive got many sources
    for the <strong>EARTH </strong> but sources arent going to be as good the original
    2-inch film strips or whatcever the source is. \r\n\r\nIve knowledge of dates
    and sources for earth font thats in the book. Thats been seen in books, movies
    and loads more locations. \r\n\r\nAny information would be greatly received.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n"

  body: "Hi Stuart\r\nIn your acquired collection. Do you have any of the fonts i
    mentioned in the paragraph. Such the EARTH font and OTHELLO. I cannot find anything
    on the internet on the EARTH font at all. Other than ELFRING but its not even
    close the full character set that's out there. I don't even know if that the EARTH
    font is the original name of it or who designed. Its all a mystery. In the library
    you acquired is that font in it. Or the OTHELLO by Morris Benton. \r\nThere are
    no websites that have viewed have samples. Or any sources I could see more of
    the characters of the fonts mentioned.\r\nJohn"
