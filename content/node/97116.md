  body: "I searched a few categories at Dafont, with no luck, because I thought it
    might have had a 'freebie' feel about it. Then I searched through some of the
    fonts of the lettering artist, the late Bob Alonso, and found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/alonso-flair/|Alonso
    Flair]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/crescent/|Crescent]]. Neither
    of these is exactly the same, but they have a similar feeling, I think.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Yes, R. and the font was done by [[http://www.haroldsfonts.com/crazy.html|Harold
    Lohner]] based on a typeface by the same name shown in \"Modern Display Alphabets\"
    by Paul E. Kennedy (Dover Books, 1974). \r\n\r\nI wonder if Harold meant for this
    to be a free font?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
