  body: First, I don&#39;t think this is a commercial font, because it looks like
    the logo for Dennison office products, and is probably a custom design. <BR> <BR>With
    that said, there are a couple of fonts that have a similar style such as Holly
    Script &#40;aka Quigley Wiggly, by Nick Curtis&#41; <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14693.gif"
    alt="QuigleyWiggly">, or ITC DeliSupreme <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14694.gif"
    alt="DeliSupreme">. These images came from Part 7 of the Script Font ID Guide,
    which has a few other styles that could also be considered similar, like Einhorn/Salut.
