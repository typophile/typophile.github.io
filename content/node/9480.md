  body: mmm, i nave to think about it. i tried to colorize a little more that text
    but then in, my opinion all the layout crashed down. so finally i colorize the
    text only at scrolling over. <BR> <BR>regz  <BR>maciek

  body: whoa...I stared at a blank screen for 10 seconds before realizing you had
    text there. You asked if you made a typographic error and you did...no contrast--making
    your text illegible. <BR> <BR>You need to look at this on a laptop &#40;LCD&#41;
    screen...the text is literally invisible.

  body: Looks like you need to fix your apostrophe in k&#39;ion.  <BR>Needs to be
    curly.  <BR> <BR>Also, there&#39;s a typo on the title of your site.  <BR>You
    have two apostrophes instead of one. <BR> <BR>

  body: arrrgh, you&#39;re right. i&#39;ll fix the double apostrophe. <BR>but what
    do you mean exactly saying &#34;curly&#34; ? <BR> <BR>regz <BR>maciek

  body: yes...the white text is invisible, as the light shade of grey you are using
    as a background does not show at all on my LCD screen. It&#39;s your site, of
    course, so do as you wish, but typically you never want to hide navigation from
    the user.

  body: but yu&#39;re right. many people suggested me too, i had to fix it. in a few
    days the white color will change into the dark grey one &#40;the same like in
    the &#34;portfolio&#34; title&#41;. i think too, i&#39;ll have to increase a little
    the font. <BR> <BR>thanks for comments <BR>regz <BR>maciek
