  years in the making, Empire of the Word is a compelling look inside the act of reading
  and traces its impact on more than five thousand years of human history. Introduced
  and narrated by one of the world's great readers, Canadian writer Alberto Manguel,
  the series traces reading's origins; examines how we learn to read; exposes censors'
  attempts to prevent our reading; and finally, proposes what the future might hold
  for this most human of creative acts."

    in it, along with the exhaustive history.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts on why reading is
    older than writing have taken up permanent residence in my casual ponderings...\r\nAny
    project about language that he is involved with is bound to be good. \r\n\r\n**I
    miss having access to TVO**"
