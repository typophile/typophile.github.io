  is going out a little more often than it should.\r\n\r\nThat being said, my iMac
  is being shut down and I don't think its good for it?\r\n\r\nIs there any truth
  to it, should I be worried?"

  body: "If you have low power it just won\u2019t run or will shut down. You might
    also get surges you don\u2019t notice. Small surges might not do anything noticeable
    but can fry your power supply over time. Your best bet is to buy a power conditioner/surge
    suppressor/battery backup unit by APC. It will cost you a few hundred dollars,
    but if it keeps you from missing a deadline or dealing with a corrupt hard disk
    it will have been worth the money."

  body: 'Bad power at ATypI St Petersburg fried a dozen or so Mac laptop power supplies.
    Basically everyone sitting stage left who was plugged in. I think with sketchy
    power you might want to invest in the solution James suggests. '

  body: It's hard to say what exactly will get fried - certainly anything directly
    connected to unfiltered line voltage (remember modems?). Your just taking your
    chances with the internal stuff.
