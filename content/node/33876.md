  body: "Sounds to me like angelo DB/anglican/viata(I have it under these 3 names
    in my folder for it) with a big outline.\r\nIf anyone knows who really owns the
    copyright for that font, and its true name/original designer, I'd be glad to hear
    about it.(For these 3, just google the name, you should find something)"

  body: "Not so easily done. Can you post a sample showing the '5' from one of those,
    assuming you have them? Viata seems to be an SSi font, which I think is a clue
    that it's not the real name, if SSi is Southern Software.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "OK, I downloaded Viata Script, and it is from Southern Software, and I recognize
    the font as something my notes call 'Anglo'. FontBank had it as <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/anglophile.htm\">'Anglophile'</a>.
    I'd say that '5' is close, but not identical.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "You know this 'spiral 5' idea is pretty popular -- there are 15 fonts just
    in my 1998 ITC/Fontek catalog that have some form of spiral 5:\r\nBang, Clover,
    Dancin', Deelirious, Gigi, Ironwork, Kulukundis, Lambada (mentioned by Patty),
    Marguerita, Mo Funky Fresh, Party, Riva, Scriptease, Victorian and Ziggy.\r\n\r\nThere's
    'Countryhouse' from the House General Collection. There's 'Kismet', and good old
    Monotype 'Curlz'.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this is not an exhaustive list, and none of
    those I've mentioned is an exact match to the posted sample. How do we know this
    is even a font? Maybe it's hand-drawn.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I agree. It could very much be hand draw, especially since the contour are
    so irregular.
