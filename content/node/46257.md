  body: "You are here for type critique, so I'll bring some on:\r\n\r\nthe a's right
    stroke should not end in an abrupt upwards \"serif\", but in one more similar
    to the h's left stroke. Also, the a seems to go way to much below the baseline,
    much more than it would be expected for the sake of optical reasons of the curves.\r\nThe
    capital H has several problems: the embellishments on the left have their contrast
    reversed, they do not really work, and generally, both the top swash, but even
    more so the left stroke of the H is not fractured (broken) enough for a \"gothic\",
    blackletter.\r\n\r\nActually the top abrupt serif on the h look also somewhat
    awkward, but I could accept that (as opposed to the a's bottom one).\r\n\r\nGenerally,
    I would advise you to have a look at a LOT of historical examples of blackletter,
    from a) different times and b) different regions of Europe. Only then will you
    get a real feeling of how blackletter works, and how it does not. There was a
    great variation in styles, so this does not so much bind you (as you might fear),
    but will even contribute inspiration, see (for you) new solutions. It's also good
    to look at the extremes, those styles which are not yet, or barely considered
    blackletter, but of which it evolved, and those which are already not, or barely
    considered still blackletter, but which stem from it (there, e.g. you can see
    how much and how you can combine rounded curves and flowing lines with broken
    elements: gothic cursive, bastarda, even the German script of the 16-18th century
    written towards the end with a pointy steel pen gives you a feel for hybrid ducti).
    The best would be to fly over here and have a look at manuscripts in archives,
    libraries, monasteries ;-) , but I guess that's out of option. Maybe you can find
    facsimiles, reproductions or albums dedicated to old manuscripts with good quality
    photos at the major Uruguayian libraries, even if you were not situated in the
    capital, use the inter-library-loan service.\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"
