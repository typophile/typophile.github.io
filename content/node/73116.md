  nerd) since I cannot seem to get the same results in Adobe Illustrator. I am sure
  it is pretty simple with layer modes, opacity and such.\r\n\r\nThanks for any tips.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You can achieve the same thing in Illustrator, just look at the Transparency
    palette and try different Blending Modes. It looks like 'Multiply', like Jackson
    said\u2026 you don't have to use layers just use Arrange to Bring To Front or
    Back and experiment with it."
