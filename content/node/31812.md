body: "Since 2001, OFFF is exploring software aesthetics and new languages for interactive
  and visual expression. \r\n\r\nEvery year, the festival features digital artists,
  web and print designers, motion graphic studios and avant-garde electronic musicians.
  But OFFF is more than an event about any of these disciplines. More than a design
  conference, a multimedia trade fair, or a digital animation festival. OFFF is an
  enthusiastic celebration of a new visual culture. \r\n\r\nFor more info, please
