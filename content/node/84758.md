  body: Why not just email the actual designer and ask him instead of coming on here?
    It is HIS portfolio site. I think he could probably give you the best answer.

  body: Confused by EBDesign's comment . . . isn't the purpose of this forum for other
    typophile members to identify typefaces? And be nice?

  body: Definitely Futura Extra Bold (sometimes called Extra Black). Not sure what
    all the uncertainty is about. This is an easy one for anyone who knows typefaces.
