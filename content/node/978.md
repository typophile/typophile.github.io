body: I&#39;m trying to get a screencap, but let&#39;s see if anyone can get it with
  a verbal description. <BR> <BR>This was used in the titles for the movie Roger Dodger
  &#40;not on the advertising material&#41;. It&#39;s an extended sans serif with
  a light, engraved feel &#40;

  body: 'It&#39;s Trade Gothic, dammit. Thanks to scoles for this one. I sometimes
    forget this sucker has a two-storey g &#40;never see the lowercase&#41;, and the
    film softened it to the point where the terminals looked round. That&#39;s enough
    excuses. <BR> <BR>As Stephen puts it: &#34;Trade Gothic is like the American Robin
    to the birdwatcher: always taunts, always pretends to be something more exciting,
    until on further inspection, we find it&#39;s just the same old thing&#34;'
