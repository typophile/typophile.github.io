body: "So without giving any information about the project this logo is for, I'm looking
  for some feedback. \r\n-What would you guess this logo represents?\r\n-How does
  it make you feel?\r\n-List some adjectives to describe it\r\n\r\nThe logo is still
  far from finished but we're struggling with a font choice. Once I get some idea
  of how other people are viewing it I'll let you know what feeling I'm aiming for
  and hopefully some of you will have some more font suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks so
  much!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Before I get comments about the typesetting...I don't own this
  font yet so these are mockups using screen captures. The type needs a lot of work
  that will come later.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_concepts8_4436.jpg]"

  body: "I do have some difficulty with the whole and a few elements, but I understand
    you need feedback on the 'feeling' departement.\r\n\r\nI just can't get past the
    fight that is being fought between the 'T' (the stem) and the rest of the tree
    (leaves. Why not one color?).\r\nThey both are fighting for attention, they both
    don't get what the deserve. Besides that the stem is very wide and bold, the hands
    - however - are tiny. I don't like this.\r\nThe hands are lost.\r\n\r\nThe whole
    is a bit dull, not vivid.\r\nThe font doesn't feel right.\r\n\r\nIn the distant
    I can see somewhat of a fairytail, but not a nice one.\r\n\r\nIt is dark, especially
    the lonely hands crying out for help.\r\nIt doesn't give me a good feeling.\r\n\r\nBut
    then again ... ten people ... ten opinions.\r\nHope this helps."

  body: "The colors are harmonious an a have a soft natural feel.\r\n\r\nThe relationships
    of the images and text leave me confused. The work is \"Take,\" but the hand is
    in an asking position, as in, \"Please give me something,\" as opposed to, \"Please
    take something (a burden, I'm guessing) from me.\" \r\n\r\nThe tree and \"taking\"
    makes me think of the giving tree which again creates a conflict. As a symbol,
    the tree is a source not a receiver. With the hands on it, it seems like the tree
    needs something.\r\n\r\nA radial arrangement of the hands suggests a group of
    people coming together. But I'm not sure why there are three groups of people,
    or why these groups are on the tree."

  body: "I don't know what this is for, but try to simplify even more.\r\nInstead
    of a T you should try to make the stem of the tree an arm + hand instead. \r\nTherefore
    removing all the other hands from the leaves."

  body: Thanks for the suggestion DavM. I had a variation just like that in my original
    concepts but he chose this concept instead. I'm actually coming into the final
    stages with the client now thanks to all the wonderful feedback from this site
    and others.
