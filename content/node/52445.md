  look like anyone's posted yet about the tiny sneak preview that <a href=http://www.houseind.com/>House
  Industries</a> has released of its \"forthcoming Neutraface Slab font collection.\"
  Four of their new <a href=http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=accessories>products</a>,
  two pillows and two totes, are covered in an all-caps alphabet in what looks to
  be one of Neutra Slab's lighter weights. Aside from a few small preview images,
  information is scarce -- though the description for the large pillow states, \"Type
  designers Christian Schwartz, Kai Bernau, Susana Carvalho, Ken Barber and Ben Kiel
  spent countless hours seated at their desks and toiling over our forthcoming Neutraface
  Slab font collection, so we designed this type-patterned pillow to remind their
  respective lumbar areas that typography can provide visual and physical comfort.\"
  Quite the type design team!\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I'm excited!"

  body: Ooh nice. But I'll have to see how it compares to the beautiful Archer. No
    way I can afford both.

  body: "Looks like a high-end contemporization of Memphis. And now that I think of
    it, Gotham Light Slab would make a killer display face. Of course, the only way
    I can afford new fonts in this economy is to make my own.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I made
    up the word contemporization. I think it kind of works for this, tho."

  body: I agree, James. Given how much character Neutraface has, I hope the full slab
    font will be a knockout. If not, it's Archer for me. I already have Memphis, Rockwell
    and Stymie.

  body: Neutra Slab is going to be different enough from Archer that you'll want both.
    Seriously. Archer is a really feminine, friendly slab. Neutra Slab will be as
    cold as Lubalin. But I like cold too.

  body: But Tiff, srsly if I have Stymie etc, will I want/need Neutraface? Archer
    represents a departure. I'm kinda feminine myself, when my talons are sheathed.

    Neutra Slab. I'll be interested to see a comparison.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It seems odd that so many of the sample/promo images all set in all caps.
    The thing that sets Neutra Slab apart (for me) is the low x-height.
