body: "This is a font ive been working, is inspired by the amazing \"Mostra\" from
  Mark Simonson. I wanted a font with a old feel to use on my vintage artworks and
  graphics, it started as a vector file that i use, but them i keep adding more characters
  and turned it into a real font. I would like to know the opinion of the people here
  about this font. Thanks.\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/CALZONE_FONT_SAMPLE2.jpg\"
