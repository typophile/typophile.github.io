  utility bills. A public utility such as Atlantic City Electric, Verizon, and South
  Jersey Gas <strong>must</strong> continue to provide you with service in the future.
  Cell phone bills are a little bit different. Cell phone bills can be wiped out,
  but cell phone companies <em>are not legally required to continue to provide cell
  phone time for you</em>.\r\n\r\nIf your cell phone company doesn't allow you to
  have additional cell phone time in the future, there are many other providers that
  are usually willing to give you service, and you can keep your same phone number.
  <strong>You can usually save substantial money when you wipe out your utility bills
  and your cell phone bills.</strong>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wipeoutyourbills.com/home/practice-areas/chapter-7-bankruptcy.html\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>IS
  YOUR CELLPHONE BILL COSTING YOU MORE THAN GROCERIES?</strong>\r\n\r\n(NEW YORK)
  -- With all the services you can tack on to your plan, your cellphone bill could
  run you well over $100 a month.  But are you spending more on texts and data than
  on food?\r\n\r\nA new survey from CouponCabin.com finds that 21 percent of cellphone
  owners spend more money per month on their phone service plan than groceries.  Forty-six
  percent of cellphone owners surveyed pay $100 or more per month for phone service.
  \ Thirteen percent pay $200 or more per month.\r\n\r\nRead On ABC News Radio: http://abcnewsradioonline.com/business-news/is-your-cellphone-bill-costing-you-more-than-groceries.html#ixzz27KLRuanv\r\n"
