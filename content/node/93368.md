    all he did\u2014no pictures.\r\nIn spite of, or more likely because of this, his
    presentation was brilliant.\r\nAn original."

    but I'm sure it will be out there soon. Has was instrumental in preserving some
    of the vintage typefaces and in both digitizing them and promoting others to do
    so, in order that they won't be lost and available only on old, poorly maintained
    and reproduced images from foundry catalogs.\r\n\r\n   - Herb"

    - what will become of his remaining type archive? As I understand it, he kept
    all the 'good' stuff after he closed up his shop, yes?\r\n\r\n"

    12,000 fonts (all on paper or film) when he closed up shop and started his mind-reading
    / magic act on board cruise ships with his wife. Who can tell what happened with
    the remaining 6,000 in the intervening years.\r\n\r\n- Herb"

    relative many times removed up the Solo line that had a really long name including
    the name Xavier contained within . . .\r\n\r\nOtherwise there really wasn't much
    left of his archives after he downsized to apartment living as I understand it

    Catalog No. 14 (1985) to read his hysterical marginal notations and typeface descriptions.\r\nHe
    and I discussed releasing a CG Solotype series back in the eighties, much like
    we did with T.J. Lyons' collection. \r\nR.I.P. Dan."

  body: "I remember being surprised at his appearance at TypeCon in SF\u2014older,
    taller and more dapper than I expected.\r\n\r\nI thought his name was made up
    when I first started acquiring his series of type specimen books (published by
    Dover) back in the early '80s. \"The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces\"
    is still the over-all best reference for identifying display film fonts. I owe
    a lot of my ability to i.d. fonts from years of poring over those books.\r\n\r\nSad
    to seem him go."
