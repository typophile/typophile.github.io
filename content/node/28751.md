    interesting that this period kind of had 'no particular style'. The Howl cover
    looks rather traditional, could have been any other author. The only pieces of
    this time I have seen, in photocopy, are two little publications of poems by Jim
    Carroll: inside 'typography' in typewriter; one cover rather traditional, in Centaur;
    the other cover appears to be a cut-and-paste piece of photo, hand-drawn stars
    and text in Cooper Black (caps only). Obviously, 'Beatnik style' was dictated
    by the means that a self-publisher or very small publisher could afford which
    at that time obviously was: typewriter.\r\n(And this doesn't seem to be restricted
    to Beatniks. I remember having read that, a decade earlier, the cover for a Moondog
    LP was calligraphed by Andy Warhol's mother, which won an AIGA award.)\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you should typewrite and scan instead of digitally faking typewriter-style.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)"
