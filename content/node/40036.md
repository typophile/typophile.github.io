    old encyclopedias and worn Tom Clancy paperbacks.\r\n\r\nI've weaned my type book
    habit lately, but once, I was so excited about a German type book that I discovered,\r\nI
    emailed Prof. Spiekermann to get his opinion. :)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?ac=sl&st=sl&qi=ZFKJmHJsjWzaZC1vMrBE2wpKi5o_6797655917_1:2:10\">bookfinder

    children's book 'Listen, Listen' for 25 cents in a small town's library used book
    sale.\r\n\r\nWe had it piled in with the rest of the kids books until I accidentally
    discovered it was worth around $100 one day."

    $50. Sweet! Have spent much too much on books this year."
