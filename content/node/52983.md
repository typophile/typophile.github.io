  body: Yes, the script is Arabic, but the text may be in Turkish, dating from the
    Ottoman rule of Greece. I'll bring this to the attention of a colleague who is
    an expert on Ottoman lettering.

    know Turkish was written in Arabic script in the past. Thanks for your input!\r\n\r\nIn
    the Wikipedia Article you linked to, Russell, under the \"Alphabet\" heading there
    is some description of how scripts and languages were sometimes combined in different
    ways, & there it also says that \"Greek-speaking Muslims would write Greek using
    the Ottoman Turkish script.\" \u2013 So this may even be Greek text?\r\nJohn,
    let me know if you'd like me to post a larger image."

  body: Oh sorry, I forgot to say that, David. I spotted very similar borders on a
    bunch of other slabs there (without inscriptions), so I kind of assumed the border
    is of 'original' Greek / Ancient origin, while this particular inscription was
    added later.

  body: "As far as the script is concerned, yes, it's Arabic. But, no, it's not an
    Arabic inscription. The language is of course Ottoman Turkish, the language of
    administration in the Balkans for some 5 centuries, from Croatia to Greece, from
    Albania to Rumania. It had a heavy admixture of Persian, which in turn had a huge
    borrowed Arabic component. The situation strongly resembles that of English, which
    is essentially a Dutch-Frisian coastal Germanic dialect with a huge admixture
    of Latin (or rather, Romance), that in turn contained large numbers of borrowed
    Greek words.\r\n\r\nThough the text on the photograph is hard to read, a positive
    identification can be reached using the connected letter group (letter block)
    roughly in the middle of the top line of the first cartouche. The archigraphemes
    KLBLR are visible. This letter block does not occur in Arabic. Moreover, the B
    is clearly disambiguated with a dot above, making it /n/. That makes the most
    likely reading \"gelenler\", \"those who are coming\" (in Turkish).\r\n\r\nThe
    border may not look particularly Ottoman for an unsuspecting eye, but it certainly
    doesn't look particularly non-Ottoman either. It may very well be a case of re-use
    of old material, but hey, the Ottomans were perfectly capable to produce such
    ornaments. For an accessible study with photographs of similar inscriptions, consult
    Fokke Dijkema's dissertation The Ottoman historical monumental inscriptions in
    Edirne (former Adrianopolis, therefore a case comparable with Athens). \r\n\r\nYou
    can gloss through it here, but the illustrations are unfortunately omitted.\r\nhttp://books.google.nl/books?id=j-YUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA13-IA2&lpg=PA13-IA2&dq=fokke+th+dijkema+inscriptions&source=bl&ots=KqYK9jHQti&sig=vy_S9qyGbJzMXa-1xjnQeJpL5pw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA13-IA2,M1\r\n\r\nOne
    has to be wary of the cult of minimizing or even ignoring the Ottoman role in
    the Balkans. A good example was recently given by prof. Machiel Kiel, who showed
    how authorities (both scholars and bureaucrats) classify the Ottoman aquaduct
    near Kavala (in Greece, between Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis) either as Byzantine
    (though it's built much later) or Genoese (in total disregard of the fact that
    the Genoese never set foot in Kavala). \r\n   \r\n\r\nThomas Milo\r\nDecoType\r\nwww.decotype.com"

  body: "From Alexandra Lesk's PhD dissertation (footnotes and figure references omitted,
    see link above for complete document):\r\n\r\n<cite>In 1805, Dodwell reports that
    the dizdar orders the removal of [stone] WW.AA.01, and places it above one of
    the entrances to the fortress (T 43). On it, the governor carves an inscription
    in Arabic script \u201Cin praise of the strong fortress and of the zeal displayed
    in its construction by Mustapha Effendi, the Voivode.\u201D Having cut off the
    back of the block, he places it over the vaulted entrance in the wall running
    south of the Beul\xE9 Gate to the northeast corner of the Odeion of Herodes Atticus.
    Ottoman cuttings on the front of the block show how it was clamped in place.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>This
    block was only identified as part of the Erechtheion in 1922, and Dinsmoor recognized
    its original position in the West Fa\xE7ade in 1924. Balanos had already replaced
    WW.AA.01 on the building with a new block during his early 20th century restoration
    of the West Fa\xE7ade, and the new block remains there to the present day.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Hill
    and Blegen read the Ottoman year of the inscription in the semi-circle in the
    middle of the bottom of the inscription as 1220 (A.H.), which corresponds to 1805
    of the common calendar. Despite the damaged nature of the block with the Ottoman
    inscription, this evidence points directly to its original position as the southernmost
    architrave block in the West Fa\xE7ade.</cite>"

    as a whole. Presumably Mustapha Effendi had strengthened some portion of the fortifications.
    Lesk refers to 'the wall running south of the Beul\xE9 Gate to the northeast corner
    of the Odeion of Herodes Atticus'. The Odeion is the Hellenistic amphitheatre
    below the southwest corner of the Acropolis. The Beul\xE9 is the main gate at
    the west of the Acropolis. At least part of the wall connecting them survives,
    if I am reading <a href=\"http://www.planetware.com/map/athens-acropolis-map-gr-acro.htm\">this
    map</a> correctly. Who built the wall? I've no idea: the fortifications of the
    Acropolis date back centuries and have been added to or renovated many times."
