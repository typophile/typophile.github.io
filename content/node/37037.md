  typography at the basel school of design in two weeks.\r\n\r\nI'm fully a fontlab-
  and FEA-novice, but i've drawn a font - and i need a RANDOM glyph substitution to
  get to work in it - that puts me in trouble at the moment.\r\nif i don't have that
  feature in the font, the whole thing is half as good/relevant.\r\ni just opened
  an account in typophile to talk with experts and find the solution\r\n\r\nmy situation
  is quite similar to steffens in http://typophile.com/node/17887\r\njust with the
  need of RANDOM added to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy concept is simple:\r\nfor each letter
  i drew 4 stylistic variants in fontlab 5 studio - then while typing the generated
  font, for example an A, it should each time just take another A out of the 4 alternatives
  there are.\r\n\r\ni get this to work, in the way that i can choose an alternative
  A in the glyph window (\"alternatives for this glyph\") in InDesign\r\n\r\ni tried
  the feature \"substitue <glyph> from <glyphclass>\" , putting all my A-variants
  in a glyphclass\r\nit works. BUT IN INDESIGN IT ALWAYS JUST TAKES THE VARIANT THAT
  IS FIRST IN THE LIST OF THE CLASS.\r\n\r\nthen i found the typophile discussion
  linked above and tried twardochs suggestions with the salt-feature and ss-feature\r\nworks
  in the same way but HOW DO I GET THE RANDOM INTO IT ????\r\n\r\nhope someone can
  help me!\r\nthanks a lot\r\n\r\njohnny\r\n\r\n"

    nixed by the OT partners for 15 years, there is no desire on the part of the owners
    of OT to allow TT fonts to contain potentially dangerous software like that which
    is required to do what you desire. \r\nCheers!"

    from\" syntax works.\r\nthere is no way to get \"real\" randomness in OpenType
    (unless you somehow build your own plugin for the application, that does what
    you desire) but you can acheive some level of pseudo randomness.\r\n\r\nthere
    are several threads here on typophile discussing how to achieve this effect, i'll
    let you wade through them yourself:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=random+site%3Atypophile.com\r\n\r\nif
    you want someone to implement this for you, you might contact [[tal leming]]"

    to.\r\n\r\nquestion back to paul:\r\nto build my own plugin, what kind of programming
    language and software is needed for that?\r\nnot that i dare to try it myself,
    but i have some programming-skilled students around here that could help me.\r\nwould
    that be a fontlab-plugin or an indesign-plugin?\r\n\r\njohnny"

    the direction of the fourth result in the google-search you suggested, and tal
    lemmings suggestion at the same time. (he advised me to do this after i emailed
    him quickly for advice and information about his possibilities in implementing.
    as you probably know he has a licensed robust random simulation algorithm - encouraged
    me to solve it myself though as a student. that's also my aim and challenge actually."

  body: glad to hear it man. i actually think the most interesting thing about achieving
    pseudo randomness is the challenge of trying different ways to achieve it and
    finding what works best.

  body: "that's surely right.\r\nmy time is a bit short to try many ways, but this
    i will surely do with the font later on.\r\nfor now i need some suitable \"randomness\"
    or alternative behavior for the presentation of my font in 10 days. parallel to
    that i also work on the lettershapes itself again - as the whole thing is about
    the different negative spaces i get through the alternative glyphs. my font is
    for posters, large type size.\r\nso now that i know i can get the alternatives
    in there, I'm doing more letterdrawing again to precisely work on the font's specialty
    of those variable spaces.\r\ncould imagine that in the end i take it out of pseudo-randomness
    to control (that might seem random) with lots of contextual glyph sub scripting
    - so that interesting spaces will happen that i explore now (also through the
    randomization)"
