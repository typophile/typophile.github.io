  is hosting a show of recent work by Barbara Kruger later this year (opens start
  of September I think). They'll be doing a discussion/talk type of event towards
  the end of the show (late Sept) and are looking for someone to speak about Kruger's
  practice from the point of view of graphic design (rather than from an art history
  point of view). The audience will most likely be artists rather than designers,
  so an awareness of contemporary art would be a help. There would be some kind of
  smallish fee and reasonable expenses (negotiable).\r\n\r\nSorry this is vague, but
  that's Tramway. Anybody interested?\r\n\r\nRobert"
