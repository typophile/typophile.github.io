    body: It depends on the resolution of the output device and the medium in which
      it is printed....Something that size at 2400 dpi on smooth resin light sensitive
      paper is easy to read by someone with good vision. So it depends on what's printing
      the output and the type of paper being used.

  body: "Courier is too thin for 6pt.\r\nIt\u2019s thin, even at typewriter size.\r\nYou
    may want to increase tracking slightly with AG at 6 pt.\r\n\r\nYou can go with
    smaller type size on a business card than other documents, because the type will
    be read in proportion to the document. However, \u201Coptical\u201D size is still
    an issue.\r\n\r\nYou can also go with smaller type size on stationery, because
    it\u2019s the secondary matter on envelopes and letters. But again, optical size
    is an issue\u2014the design should look as if it\u2019s scaled for the real world,
    not something that was created by a designer working at 300% on a monitor.\r\n"

    Our eyesight tends to get worse as we age, so if your client's customers include
    many folks over 40, you might want to go a bit larger."

    you mean Courier New, or do you think that even the Mac version is still too light?"

  body: "People have used 4 1/2 points at times, but that type size is very small
    and hard to read. Where space is very much at a premium, one might consider 6
    points, but even that is very small.\r\n\r\nBut I don't see 8 points, or even
    7 points, as overly small for certain elements of the design that properly should
    be in small printing. Those sizes are readable if printed normally.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    since 12 point type on a computer is usually 10 point type with generous leading,
    as what I've just said applies to actual physical lead type (remember it?) perhaps
    9 point type - or 8 point - is the absolute minimum in your situation."

  body: "Courier New has stems widths similar to Helvetica 35.\r\nMac Courier has
    stem widths between Helvetica 45 and 55, and would probably have enough heft at
    7 pt, but you might be concerned about the counters of /m.\r\n\r\nWhy are you
    even asking this question?\r\nWhy not just do a few layouts with your preferred
    typefaces at different sizes, and see which works best?\r\n"

  body: "@Nick Shinn:\r\n<cite>Why are you even asking this question?</cite>\r\n\r\nTo
    me, it seems obvious why he is asking this question. He might produce a business
    card with six-point type on it, and it might look all right to him - but <em>other
    people</em> might find the small print impossible to read.\r\n\r\nSo, either he
    tests his layout on a large number of other people - some who have vision problems
    or are elderly - or he tries to find out if there is an acknowledged standard
    in the industry that covers this concern.\r\n\r\n\"I can read this\" is not the
    same as \"Nearly everyone will be able to read this\"."
