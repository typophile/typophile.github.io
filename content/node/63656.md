    an optical illusion stuff fan.\r\n       Just to say, keep up the good work, and
    that I'm working on a font, for personal use, just for easy pattern making, but
    with letters too. I just started and I'll show when I think it's ready to show
    it off.\r\n\r\n       Regards\r\n       Jo\xE3o"
