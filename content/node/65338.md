body: "Hi Typophiles\r\n\r\nI am working on a packaging project with Edwardian Script
  ITC as the secondary typeface. The capital Z however is a bit tricky. \r\n\r\nDo
  anyone know of a script that has a capital Z that would fit together with Edwardian
  Script but be more regular in it's shape? Right now I am trying on Snell Roundhand
  on for size but would like to hear from you. The Z has to stay above the baseline
  because I need to place a small text below. Worst case I need to draw the Z myself
  but it would be an easier process if I could substitute the letter and kern my way
  to a nice result.\r\n\r\nI did a search and someone posted Ballantines, but the
  capital Z looks a bit like a capital L to me...\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ballantines+script+&site=d&start=26&num=25]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Z_for_Zoo_5707.png]"

  body: Citadel Script could be a nice alternative. It is a bit loopy in the top but
    the harmony with Edwardian is quite good. Thanx

  body: Tried the Dorchester Script. The Z has the main weight on the vertical strokes
    + I find it a bit too detailed...
