    links are present and for others <BR>they aren&#39;t. There doesn&#39;t seem to
    be any rhyme or <BR>reason '

  body: Nope. He&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontalicious.com/shopping/FONstore.cgi?user_action=list&amp;category=Family"
    target="_blank"> gone commercial</a>. More power to him, but he&#39;s going <BR>about
    it, in my opinion, in a rather strange way. <BR> <BR>He&#39;s selling new fonts
    in families for $75 USD per family and <BR>postscript versions of his old freeware
    fonts for $15. His families <BR>include 6 fonts, which amounts to a steal per
    font, but he&#39;s no <BR>House Industries. <BR> <BR>Compare this with Jakob Fischer
    selling <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/pizzadude/" target="_blank">
    new Pizzadude fonts</a> <BR>via MyFonts at a nice price. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    see either of the Fontalicious tacks being very successful <BR>... but what do
    I know? <BR><br>
