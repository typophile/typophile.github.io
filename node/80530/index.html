  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A friend of mine, the sculptor Amy Kann <a href="http://www.amykann.com/">http://www.amykann.com/</a> is known for her stunning bas relief work and as a result designs her share of coins, medals and plaques involving type as well as portraits in which the subject&rsquo;s name is a critical typographic element. She&rsquo;s asked me to collaborate with her on a project.</p>
<p>The client requested Caslon as close to the 18th Century version as possible. The debates here and elsewhere about the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Caslon</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great conversation here: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/30941">http://typophile.com/node/30941</a>  but I can&rsquo;t seem to find a straight answer. Does anyone have a new take on this age old question?</p>
<p>My second question is about typography and coin design, of which I&rsquo;ve found scant little in googling &ldquo;coin design numismatic typography&rdquo; and similar phrases.  Surely a typophile out there has done a study on the subject. A straight search came up with little, but an image search <a href="http://bit.ly/eyBQHc">http://bit.ly/eyBQHc</a> scored some beautiful results.</p>
<p>Any typophiles have a special interest in the topic?  Thanks in advance.  And check out Amy&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s great stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On Caslon, the reason you didn&rsquo;t find a &ldquo;straight answer&rdquo; is because there isn&rsquo;t one universal answer. If you print sloppily inked letterpress on soft, damp paper using foundry type that closely approximates Caslon&rsquo;s, you will get a result that looks like typical eighteenth-century printing. If you use a different technology, you have to make choices about which qualities you will emulate. Founder&rsquo;s Caslon is the closest digital design to the outlines of Caslon&rsquo;s own foundry type, but it&rsquo;s &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; than the normal eighteenth-century ink spread or the texture of the paper, both of which Caslon may have allowed for in designing his type. Is that &ldquo;real&rdquo; or not? That depends on you.</p>
<p>As for coin design, I don&rsquo;t know what your question is. The letter and number punches formerly used in making coin dies were certainly similar in nature to the punches used in making type matrices - I expect it would be interesting to know whether they were ever made by the same people. Medals are different, after the invention of the Janvier lathe - the lettering is often modeled rather than cut.</p>
