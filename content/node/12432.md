  /img>\r\n\r\nAlthough frequently described as a typographic atrocity committed against
  a helpless world, [[Vincent Connare]]'s Comic Sans is one of the fonts most widely
  used by the general public, who love its artless, jaunty feel. Users love it as
  much as typographers and designers <a href=\"http://www.bancomicsans.com/\">hate
  it</a>.\r\n\r\nComic Sans is an (extremely) informal handwritten script which approximates
  a child's scrawl, and was <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2648\">developed
  specifically as a visual element</a> for [[Microsoft]]'s long-forgotten Bob, an
  attempt at a \"friendlier\" version of the [[Microsoft Windows]] user interface.
  Connare has since <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20611.html\">made
  it clear</a> he never intended the font for general use. From the name it might
  be inferred that it was modeled after comic book lettering, but comic book lettering
  is generally more formal / regular, and this was not Connare's intent. [[Apple Computer]]
  honored the popularity of Comic Sans by commissioning the design of Chalkboard,
  which bears a very strong resemblance to Comic Sans while signally failing to be
  an improvement.\r\n\r\nWhether it is ever appropriate to use Comic Sans is a <a
  href=\"http://typographi.com/000389.php\">hotly-debated matter</a> in typographic
  circles, including Typophile (with the dominant sentiment being, \"No. Never. Not
  ever.\"), but in practice it is frequently used for party invitations, lost pet
  posters, inter-office memos and anywhere else a designer (professional or otherwise)
  wants lettering that is legible but still eye-catching.\r\n\r\nRead <a href=\"http://www.connare.com/comic.htm\">Vincent
  Connare's own account</a> of the development of Comic Sans. You might also want
  to read an <a href=\"http://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/000118.php\">interview</a>
  in which Vincent says \"If you love it (Comic Sans), you don't know much about typography
  and if you hate it you really don't know much about typography either and you should
  get another hobby.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Trivia</strong>\r\nStarting November 30th 2007,
  Comic Sans was the featured face on Typophile http://typophile.com/node/39634\r\n\r\n<strong>Articles:</strong>\r\n<a
