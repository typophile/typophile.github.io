body: "We have a job in to typeset, the first in what will be a long series, the letters
  of Henry James. It turns out that the publisher wants to use a special ampersand
  in some places where James used \u201Chis\u201D ampersand. While the publisher has
  not yet found money for an XML version of the book(s), It does seem likely, especially
  since the eventual publication of all the letters will run many years. \r\n\r\nSo
  while it is not hard to create and set the \u201Cspecial\u201D ampersand, if I put
  it as such in the composition file, there will be a problem downstream.\r\n\r\nI
  believe InDesign CS II does not support salt, which might be one way to typeset
  different ampersands, while retaining the general Unicode number for an ampersand.\r\n\r\nThe
  other way I can think of is to embed a \u201Cprivate use\u201D character of zero
  width in the file before all the ampersands to be rendered with the special character,
  then use \u201Ccontextual alternatives\u201D to set the special ampersand in the
  book. From limited testing on another matter, the private use character will drop
  out in plain text, leaving just the call for the ampersand, so an XML file using
  any font will at least display an ampersand \u2013 though not, of course, James\u2019
  rendition.\r\n\r\nSill it bugs me to approach the matter this way. Anybody think
  of a better solution?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    body: "Yes, thanks. I was thinking that the appropriate use of sets is\r\n\r\n\"Function:
      In addition to, or instead of, stylistic alternatives of individual glyphs (see
      'salt' feature), some fonts may contain sets of stylistic variant glyphs corresponding
      to portions of the character set, e.g. multiple variants for lowercase letters
      in a Latin font.\"\r\n\r\nThere aren't going to be multiple variants, but I
      suppose this is a case of whatever works."

  body: "You could also use the titl - Titling - feature, though that's probably not
    as Kosher as a Stylistic Set, but it would be supported by Illustrator and Photoshop.
    (Stylistic Sets are presently only supported by InDesign CS2.) \r\n\r\nAs long
    as your alternate ampersand is named \"right\", you shouldn't have problems. The
    correct form would be ampersand.alt (or ampersand.James, or something like that,
    but I would stick with .alt.)\r\n\r\nAnother alternative might be to have a separate
    version of the face with the \"basic\" ampersand changed to the Jamesian ampersand,
    and use that font for all James quotations."
