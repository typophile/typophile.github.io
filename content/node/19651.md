  to id this font, but I can't seem to find the right match for it, anyone who can
  please help?\r\n\r\nI have also asked previously at WhatTheFont and was pointed
  to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers-lt/49-light-ultra-condensed/\">Univers
  LT 49 Light Ultra Condensed</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd as I replied there too, indeed I also
  had gone through Univers. But some doubt remained (and remains) especially due to
  the counters of both the \u201CD\u201D and \u201CR\u201D (which seem not as wide,
  even comparatively to the width of the lines) and also the space between the vertical
  strokes of the \u201CU\u201D (which also seems to be not as wide as in Univers)...
  (Only hope I'm not talking nonsense with this what I'm saying?...)\r\n\r\nThus I'd
  truly appreciate also your views over it please and thank you so much already for
  any further enlightenment.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uc-dress-ls_4706.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you, Geoff Riding, for your reply. :-)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have tried
    it out, to superimpose Univers 49 Light Ultra Condensed over the original (I have
    tried with 3 different consecutive sizes, 120, 121 and 122), and it feels like
    it still doesn't match 100% with it?... (Or do you think that perhaps the non-100%-match
    may result from something like the printing of the original or maybe something
    else?... Or perhaps my attempt to superimpose one type to the other wasn't done
    in such a correct way?...)\r\n\r\n(And again, pardon all of my ignorance... Which
    is in the end also the reason I wonder about and ask... :-))\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uc-dress-ls-3_5660.jpg]"

  body: In the end so it was Univers Light Ultra Condensed all along... Thank you
    again for the confirmation. :-)
