  body: I don't believe that Copan is available as a font, but only as raster alphabet
    components.

  body: Very neat! I am curious if it's available for download and use? It doesn't
    appear to be from Julia's site.

  body: Yes, definitely vector graphics.  If you look at the various samples that
    can be found, there's both a four-line alphabet and, for smaller use, a three-line
    set of A to Z. Punctuation and special characters may also have both 3 and 4 line
    alternates.
