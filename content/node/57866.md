  body: You can see the variation between the multiple versions of each letter, so
    chances are it is hand drawn. Specifically, the 'W,' 'E,' and 'R' are pretty obvious
    examples.

  body: Forty years ago hand letterers were common.  Now it seems that only Hollywood
    still uses them.  I agree that this is not a font.  Or at least not a font outside
    of the studio that did this poster.

    it's not a typeface as you said. Anyway, I like very much this kind of tall childish
    script font.\r\nAnybody knows a typeface with this style? anything similar?\r\nThank
    you. "

  body: "<cite>\"At Mojo, we recently worked on a custom typeface for the Warner Bros.
    movie Where The Wild Things Are. It was meant to look like the writing of the
    lead child actor, and the studio responded very positively to the lettering of
    Erik Buckham, one of our art directors. So he drew up a bunch of the characters,
    I digitized them, and built it all in FontLab. One of the problems with making
    a typeface that is supposed to look hand-drawn is that it never does because of
    the uniformity of characters when placed next to each other. For example, the
    double o in book. Erik drew up some alternates, and I programmed an OpenType substitution
    that made certain that no two versions of the same character ever sat next to
    each other.\"</cite> \r\n- http://www.lettercult.com/archives/387#more-387"
