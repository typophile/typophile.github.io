<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've been trying to put together a memorable, simple, and relevant logo for a laboratory I'm setting up. I was here <a href=http://typophile.com/node/36926>a while ago</a>, where <a href=http://typophile.com/node/36926#comment-227633>a particularly helpful comment</a> prompted me to abandon the line of thought there.
I'm back now with a new name and a new concept. Mostly this is just an exercise in developing a logo because it's fun. My lab won't be the only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nonlinear+dynamics+laboratory">Nonlinear Dynamics Laboratory</a>, so I figure that if nothing else, I can have the best branding. In particular, I'm trying to make a logo that can stand on its own without the long name.
Here's the first idea I have, which is to add a recognizable nonlinearity to a logotype of the initials.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonlinear_4691.png]
(Note to the curious: all of the gimmicks are relevant to the research that might go on in the lab, though some are more recognizable than others. The mockups are based on 1) a <a href=http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/~moisy/Disques/spipos.gif>spiral vortex on a rotating disk</a>, 2) a signal showing <a href=http://www.flometrics.com/products/fluids_lab/reynolds_experiment.html>laminar-turbulent transition</a>, and 3) "distributed roughness elements" (too esoteric to link) or <a href=http://www.uni-saarland.de/fak7/wagner/uploads/pics/Vortices.JPG>Taylor vortices</a>. I could also do something like the <a href=http://www.onera.fr/photos-en/tunnel/images/255551-von-karman.jpg>von Karman vortex street</a> or the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif>Rayleigh-Taylor instability</a> because they're pretty and famous, but I'm less likely to do research into them and they're harder to get into illustrator.)
The white-on-black version is promising, but I can't think of a way to complete the left side of the N.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonlinear_inverse_5071.png]
Another possibility is the vortex without the NDL. I like this for its simplicity, but I'm concerned that the vortex isn't distinctive enough on its own.

Any comments or ideas?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey Michael, I really like the look and feel of the logo and type treatment. I have to say that the L might be a little ambiguous on your letter shape. I also wanna point out that the third one could be misconstrued as something less scientific happening. Both the von Karmen and the instability that you didn't do should be easily traceable with the pen tool, plus you might have some more creative control. Also maybe reworking the second one could produce something a little more appealing, maybe try moving those strands out so that they meet on the border of the D counter(bowl?)?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the comment. Here are a couple quick ones with the traced vortex street and an idea for bounding the left side of the N in the white-on-black version. I'm sure that the placement of the street can be improved.
I agree with the problem with the L part of the logotype, but I'm not sure what to do about it.

The basic NDL concept seems familiar, but I can't figure out whose logo it reminds me of. Does anybody know?</div>

If you had the option of abbreviating it as NLDL, and not NDL, you may get a few other interesting possibilities. I just scribbled a couple of ideas in case you'd like to think along those lines:

<div class=commentbody>The second scribble is interesting, but I think it too easy to read the L first. (I'm aware that there's precedent in Texas A&M's magical ATM logo.) I'll play around with some similar concepts and see if I can make something work.
I see the snail now. It's a good thing to consider with the current initialtype.
A friend of mine suggested this option:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nonliner_itex_6661.png]
I like the use of dot on the i, but I can't decide where to put the Texas A&M.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Laboratory should look fresh, clean, safe, healthy, non hazadous etc. The icon, imagery does not seem right at this moment in time. The colour doesnt feel right either. Hmm...I was thinking light blue, test tubes, coloured chemicals etc. What kind of laboratory is this, may I ask? What things do you deal with? What about adopting hazadous symbols seen on chemical bottles within the typography? </div>

<div class=commentbody>My lab isn't very dangerous, unfortunately. In fact, the oil I use comes with a label that says it's FDA-approved and the flow-visualization flakes are safe for use generally in the area surrounding the eye (because they're normally used in eye shadow). The imagery is pretty close to what I'm doing, which is more math than mad science.
I will have some sweet lasers though...</div>

<div class=commentbody>The only one I still remember after reading all these comments is the one with a waterfall-looking thing over the initials. It was cool, and conveyed "nonlinear" and "dynamic" in the colloquial sense of the words in addition to the scientific.
And I agree that the "L" is hidden - I didn't even know it was supposed to be there until I read the comments!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I recommend ditching the NDL idea. Initials are static, defined and by their very nature and essence, linear. Consider some shapes involved with chaos and nonlinear systems. Any way that you could use fractals as an inspiration? Unless I betray a complete and utter ignorance of the topic at hand...</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't like to point this out, but the pattern element just detracts from the type and information. It doesn't feel harmonious. It doesn't feel right. It's where the eye is led to straight away. I wish there was more going for it. Have you had any chance to develop further? It seems too chaotic to me. It's the pattern. It disturbs me. I don't like to say it but i've had to. What about a pattern in the 'O' of the name of the company. There could be a whole new world involved with the 'O'. The world where all these things happen. Hmm...am I going crazy?</div>
