body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nIn the past few weeks, I have unexpectedly been appointed Creative
  Director of a large magazine here in Ireland. This is also the first time that I
  have sub-editors underneath me who also consider themselves \"design conscious\",
  so I have found myself having to please a team of people (as well as my superiors)
  when it comes to redesigning this monster.\r\n\r\nAlas, I was thrown into the position
  after my predecessor abruptly left, and have, for the first few weeks (it is published
  twice a month) been working into the previous design, although I dislike it very
  much. The style has steadily (although quite slightly) moved away from the previous
  design, but there's still a lot of work to do.\r\n\r\nI'm having a bit of a dilemma,
  though: the previous magazine I worked at (although inferior in many ways, published
  only one every six weeks, and with a much smaller circulation \u2014 plus the journalism
  here is above and beyond what I'm used to) was designed very well. When I started
  there, I worked on redesigning it with the then editor, and we spent a lot of time
  choosing pretty great fonts. Greta Text was what we used for the body, and we used
  Titling Gothic for headlines. In that sense, I'm finding it very hard to just not
  replicate that design for this magazine. I loved it. So I need help choosing fonts
  to replace these.\r\n\r\nThe current body text of the magazine is Brioni Text, which,
  funnily enough, isn't too far away from Greta Text (same foundry and all), so I
  think I may stick with that.\r\n\r\nBut, I need a display font that is as expansive
  (with all the weights and styles) as Titling Gothic. I love Titling Gothic, but
  as I said, I can't use it; it's still in use at my old magazine. \r\n\r\nI want
  to choose <em>one</em> font that can be used permanently for headlines. One that
  has a lot of variation in its styles, but remains consistent and coherent. So it
  needs to be a whole family of styles. It needs to be a sans-serif. One that looks
  beautiful spread across a newsprint magazine, or in medium sizes.\r\n\r\nI have
  a pretty huge budget to work with here, as redesigning was one of the conditions
  for me taking up the job so suddenly.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate some thoughts
  on this, and perhaps suggestions for other body text fonts to match it. (I think
  we will stick with Brioni Text, though. I like \"friendly\" serifs, such as Skolar.
  But Greta is closer to \"serious\", while still being friendly \u2014 that, I like.)\r\n"

  body: "The magazine is a youth-orientated, political, current affairs and culture
    magazine. It has interviews with politicians, film reviews, investigative journalism
    and all that kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nThanks <em>sevag</em> ... I really do like
    what Type Together offers, and some of their body fonts are absolutely wonderful.
    \r\n\r\nHowever: I think Tablet Gothic is too similar to Titling Gothic. I was
    hoping for something in the same realm, but not something which looks like it's
    been heavily inspired by Titling Gothic (I don't know the <em>actual</em> history
    of the font.)\r\n\r\nAre there any other display fonts that have as many styles
    and weights while also being a bit different? Maybe more \"rounder\" than Titling
    Gothic?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."
