body: "Hello folks,\r\n\r\nHaving done some Arabic typesetting in the past, I now
  need to set a few pages in Persian for a book. This has made me realise the many
  subtle differences between Arabic and Persian typesetting (bit slow, I know). Apparently
  it is difficult to find information on this in English on the web, and I have this
  particularly nagging (because visually prominent) question:\r\n\r\nin Persian, should
  there always be a space between a conjunctive waw and the following word?\r\nis
  this space (if mandatory) breakable, or no line breaks are allowed after it?\r\n\r\nFor
  example:\r\nin Arabic you would write \"wasalAm\"\r\n\u0648\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\r\n\r\nin
  Persian, do you write \"wa salAm\"?\r\n\u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\r\n\r\nis
  that an optional thing?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for your help,\r\nJuan"

  body: 'Well, the sample I have is a text of 6-7 pages set at a university in Iran,
    and this spacing is throughout. If it is plain wrong, then I guess it means their
    typesetting is really bad, that''s why I would like to confirm with someone who
    has experience on this. '

  body: BTW, in Arabic both forms are permitted depending on the preference of the
    author (it is partly regional), I myself use a thin non-breaking space for typeset
    material, otherwise no space at all to avoid a waw by itself at the end of the
    line (which is as bad as a comma at the beginning of a line). No idea about Persian,
    though.

  body: Maybe it's late to answer this, but as a Persian native I have to say both
    forms are permitted. but the first one is more legible, because "wa" means "and"
    in Persian and that could cause ambiguity.
