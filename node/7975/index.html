		<div class="commentbody">Jeff isn't being pessimistic. When companies stop putting value into design, it hurts everyone who does. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A good logo requires lots of research, time, care, and craft. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The company may even perceive that they are getting a bargain. They recieve a variety of designs, and they get to pick which one. But a good designer can do in one try what it takes 100 amateurs to attempt (but fail). Likely, instead of a logo that holds its value over time, the company has to redesign once again. Whatever they invested into applications of the first logo is usually lost. Consumers need time to familiarize themselves with a logo, and this time is also lost. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David, there is plenty of conversation about speculative contests online. If you read up on it more, and not just Jeff's article, you will see that it isn't positive for anyone, not even for the person who &quot;wins&quot;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only thing worse than a potential client who does not value the efforts of a professional graphic designer is a designer who doesn't appreciate the value of their own time and work.  While I enjoy designing logos, and get a great deal of personal satisfaction from my work, I'm running a business and need to make a living.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I want to do some good for a nonprofit organization in whose cause I strongly believe I will produce some pro bono work and then promote the hell out of it.  In many cases such organizations can't afford the services of a professional designer and will greatly appreciate what is done for them.  There is tremendous value in working with nonprofits in this manner.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with the so-called &quot;contests&quot; for  for-profit ventures is that the &quot;client&quot; will not appreciate the value of one's work when they are basically getting it for free.  That is often what it is worth to them - nothing.  These for-profit business are simply trying to avoid paying market value for the work of designers - and getting a lot of speculative designs in the process.  They are basically taking advantage of naive designers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The value of my work is determined by 27 years of past experience, my talents and my skills.

		<div class="commentbody">Dave, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Darrell, Jeff Fisher, Lauri Johnson, Brian and Allessandro Segalini are right on, you are just not listening. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You will probably answer this posting with another plug for your design firms logo contest just like all your other postings. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Design contests or spec work are a harmful practice<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Design contests amounts to providing design work for free. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many major private and public sector clients think it is good business practice to hold a design contest or require spec work as part of their search and selection process when recruiting the services of a graphic designer or design firm. In fact, requests for design contests or spec work: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- are exploitative, as they demand design work for free and without guarantee of compensation, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- offer no future potential, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- can lead to copyright infringement, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- devalue the profession of graphic design and lead to negative competitive practices, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- threaten the integrity and work ethic of the graphic design profession, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- are discouraged by allied professions such as the advertising industry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The 2010 Winter Olympics was awarded to Vancouver Canada. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The committee chose a design competition for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Emblem. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The prize was $25,000 Cdn.and two tickets to the opening ceremonies. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Society of Graphic Designers of Canada a professional body chose not to recommend participation to its members since it was exploitive.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->GDC Response<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kosmo</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am friend with a person from MGDC <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Society of Graphic Designers of Canada). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Read : <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems like there are lots of similarities in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design professions all over the world. One big  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->goal of my professional organization is the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->educate everybody else about what a designer is, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and the benefit of working with someone with a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->full set of skills, not just Dreamweaver. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This came after this text : <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I never give them hell for having a competition, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->because it is done from ignorance. So I can help  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->educate them. They can take it or leave it. Some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->people will never get it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding: Announcement of Graphic Design Competition <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you for your fax regarding the competition. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I must decline to participate. As a Professional <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Member of the Graphic Designers of Canada, I  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->subscribe to our Society's Code of Ethics, which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prohibits members from undertaking speculative <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I design something; if you like mine, I get paid;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you like someone else's better, I don't get  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->paid) design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have found that people and organizations  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seeking quality design are sometimes not well- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->served by design competitions. A professional  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->designer's job includes research and the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->establishment (with the client) of an effective  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->marketing plan which should be the driving force <!-- raw HTML omitted -->behind any design. The risk with requests for  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->speculative design can be that designs submitted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might not be founded on sound marketing and long- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->term planning principles, and therefore not be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strong tool in the development of the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->organization. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not trying to be contentious, but&hellip; If you  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->needed legal work done, would you ask a group of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lawyers to submit work and the winner would get  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->paid? Or dental work? Or film-making or copy- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->writing? If not, why is it appropriate for  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->graphic design work? My guess is that it's  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->because you have seen contests like this  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->advertised before. But there are alternatives  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that are respectful of both a client's finances  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and a designer's work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I understand an organization's wish to achieve  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->goals in the most economical way. All of my  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clients want their work done economically. If  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you are ever in need of design again, there are  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->several ways that designers can be approached,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->solid working relationships established, and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design goals reached, without the 'speculative  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work request' trap. I'd be happy to discuss this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with a representative of your organization,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should you want to know more. (This is not a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->self-serving offer: I am on the executive of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->local chapter of the Graphic Designers of Canada, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and part of what I do is supply the public with  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->information. When I do this, I remove myself  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from consideration for professional benefit.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wish you well in your search for your new  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->identity. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sincerely, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AS</div>
