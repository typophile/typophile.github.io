body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nAccording to the owner of the company this logo is based on a particular
  font. But she doesn't know what font. My job is to elaborate on this logo, so my
  question is: does anybody know what font is used? Or does someone have an idea or
  suggestion for other compatible fonts?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "It's possible it isn't a font, or at least a terribly professional one. It
    doesn't look like the verticals and horizontals have been optically reconciled.\r\n\r\nI
    would think that you could more or less easily elaborate on it using a grid of
    square cells. "
