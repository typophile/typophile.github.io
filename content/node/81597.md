body: "This is my first attempt at designing a (very rudimentary) typeface. \r\n\r\nI've
  used a simple system where each letter is based on the letter \"o\" \u2013 although
  I'm aware that such a rigid approach is problematic to say the least. (I've tweaked
  only a few letters so far.) \r\n\r\nAll feedback on further alterations I need to
  consider, etc, would be much appreciated, thanks."

    could be interesting in your take is the varying width of the stroke."

  body: "riccard0, thanks for your reply. \r\n\r\nAs you say I think that the varying
    width is the potentially interesting aspect here. \r\n\r\nAny comments on specific
    alterations to individual glyphs / the overall typeface would be appreciated."

  body: It all depends on how much you want to stick to the purely geometric construction.
    Otherwise, optically, s is too narrow/unbalanced, u and k are too wide, etc.

  body: "Thanks again for the feedback: this is exactly the sort of help I was hoping
    for. I don't really understand how one makes decisions about glyph width, etc,
    etc. Are there specific rules? Is it done purely by eye?\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to
    sacrifice the rigidity of the geometric system in an attempt to create a much
    more subtle typeface, although I don't want to lose the overall geometric feel.
    I will try making some alterations and upload the results soon."

  body: Varying the widths will give you much more flexibility. The lowercase k in
    particular would benefit from being more narrow
