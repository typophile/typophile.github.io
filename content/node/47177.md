body: "Friends, Romans, countrymen\r\n\r\nI'm working on a book/catalogue at the moment
  and plan on using tan or sand coloured stock. I usually avoid rich black for text
  at all costs because of registration issues but I want to avoid the washed out look
  of 100% keyline black on coloured stock.\r\n\r\nI am only using two inks throughout
  the book, black for text (and some low res images) and a pms metallic (silver) for
  illustrations. The illustrations in silver sit partially behind the text and I want
  to make sure that the black does not dissapear when overprinted.\r\n\r\nAny advice?
  I was thinking about using a pms black instead of process black. I have not used
  any metallic colours before, anything I should know?\r\n\r\nThanks all"

    pms colors will not look very good on uncoated stock, especially not paper with
    a soft, rough surface."

    stock I have my eye on is coated. Will that require sealing?\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: I'm not quite sure what I mean by that either, some process after printing,
    varnishing I guess?

  body: Look at PMS K7. It is a mix of K and Silver. It prints as a very warm black.
    I use it for text on off white stock.
