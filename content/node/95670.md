  90% of the time, when I am editing a glyph, I wish I could edit the outlines and
  keep the sidebearings in place... which of course means the sidebearing line needs
  to \"float\" with and glyph changes I make that affect the advance width. Of course,
  occasionally one does not want this, so it would be ideal to have some sort of \"force
  linked sidebearings\" toggle button when in the glyph window. Maybe the button would
  be part of the FLS glyph properties floating palette?\r\n\r\nEven when the sidebearings
  are linked to the outlines, you would still be able to click and drag on the sidebearings
  as you can today, to adjust them.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem like a useful feature to
  people? Would you want it on by default like I would?"

    sidebearings are not a static value; rather, they are linked to the amount of
    whitespace created within a glyph and thus must be flexible. Editing a glyph,
    you also edit the counter shape, and must account for its changes in the sidebearings.\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    you can achieve the behavior described with a Python script; look into the Robofab
    \u2018marginPen\u2019 module."

    mind, but it does need to account for internal whitespace. So what about this:
    the designer defines a ratio (which depending on the design and what the designer
    believes could be 1:1, or 4:3 or maybe even something more complex) and the shift
    in the black causes a different shift in the sidebearing depending on the ratio.\r\n\r\nRemember
    that type design is always eyeball-iterative; it's not like any algorithm can
    obviate that, but good algorithms can certainly save time.\r\n\r\nAs for what

  body: "Thomas' request makes sense. I don't understand the criticism of it. This
    is a request for a very simple mechanism that links left/right sidebearing to
    whatever the glyph's left/right extremum is, and makes sure that the sidebearing
    value remains the same as outlines get adjusted. Put differently, do not consider
    sidebearings as implicit in advance width and outline data, instead consider sidebearings
    as independent of outline data. Such a simple mechanism does not need to care
    for internal whitespace or any rationes. Plus it is suggested to be optional,
    so nothing is taken away from you.\r\n(Fond of the idea because I saw a need for

    allow explicit linking of sidebearing distance to a specific node on the outline,

    enable one to easily control the distance relative to, e.g. vertical stems instead
    of serif tips. I considered trying this relative to the FL measuring line, but
    that needs to be moveable, so it makes more sense to apply the distances explicitly

    yet another fixedly horizontal 'rod', but I don't have strong feelings about this.
    The linking of nodes to the baseline intersection of the sidebearings that I illustrated
    mirrors sidebearing linking in FontLab's TrueType hinting tool, and might usefully
    be connected with that in the same way that PS stem hints or links can be mapped
    to TT hints.

  body: Provided I understand you both correctly, you agree on functionality and disagree
    merely on representation of it. (The rod extends only to one side, so cannot be
    mistaken for a guide line or measurement line; the sidebearing line could moreover
    share a color with the rod, so it is obvious that they belong together. Personally
    I find the link-to-baseline misleading for it suggests that y matters when it
    is about x alone; it would be difficult to differentiate an additional y related
    rod, then. What about highlighting the whole region, from sidebearing to x of
    point, in light color, and mark the related point?)

    more I think about it, the more I like the idea of the display being the same
    as in a sidebearing link in the TT hinting interface: it is in fact the same thing,
    a means of indicating a particular distance relationship between a point and the
    sidebearing, one in em units and one in device units."

    the child. So, if you're adjusting the sb in a grade-oriented hierarchy or a hierarchy
    for linear rendering, then sb points are the parents, while if you're adjusting

    Except it's not really \"analogous\" because they are the same thing unless you
    get bogged down in non-integer units per em, sub-pixel positioning, a type1-centic
    mindset, or impure TT interpreters. A grid's a grid, and as such it has rhythm.
    Fonts, the point size spectrum, frames of film and a few other things also have
    rhythm. Everything's fine until one wants to combine these rhythms in hostile
