    handwriting and sketches of American experimental composer John Cage, this set
    was produced in conjunction with The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles
    and the John Cage Trust. This unique collection includes 52 graphic extras culled
    from the composer's notes and scores, as well as the \"Cage Silence\" font inspired
    by Cage's seminal work 4' 33\".</em></blockquote>\r\n"

    \ \r\n\r\nThis is what I get when I open the font in the native Win Xp font viewer:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4010.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    this is what it looks like when I open it up in Fontlab:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1
    copy_5994.png]\r\n\r\nWhat craziness is this?!!  Perhaps our computers are designed
    to put in some \"basic sans font\" info into a font if they can't find any outlines?
    \ But then, why would my computer not do the same?"

    I saw something different than <em>both</em> screen shots above!\r\n\r\nOn my
    Win 7 machine, all characters were neatly chopped off exactly at the baseline
    and so I reckoned it was representing Cage's \"less is more\" rule.\r\n\r\n I'll
    see if I can post an image. It did look kind of neat."

    of guy. A universal mind. Well, in the arts.\r\n\r\nThe font you show might work
    for some sort of historical placement of the guy, but surely would not be what
    he'd pick were he working today."
