  little over a decade ago, most typesetting for printed books used to be done in
  this software called Word for DOS. The software made use of macros to embed scientific/matematical
  equations in the body of the text (similar to Microsoft Equation Editor). In the
  years since, Word for DOS has become obsolete and even if you still have an operational
  version of Word for DOS and people who know how to use it, it is a pain to typeset
  your books in compared to Pagemaker and InDesign.\r\nIs there a way of converting
  these \"word for dos\" files into their equivalent LaTeX files, for instance, so
  that the links to the equations are not broken and you essentially avoid the problem
  of retyping the whole book again?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIshita"

    Equation editor. I could type in the most complex ones from memory, only to see
    them mangled by the PostScript output -- on screen they looked great but the conversion
    to PS didn't work 100% ...\r\n\r\nIf you <em>do</em> mean WordPerfect, the good
    news is that, AFAIR, the equation editor text is 100% TeX compatible. That means
    you can copy & paste it into MathType, which, if memory serves, offers this possibility.\r\n\r\nThe
    bad is that the equations are embedded into the document itself, so you will need
    (a) an ancient program to read it with, (b) an ancient computer on which you can
    run it (try Microsoft's VirtualPC, with MS-DOS6 installed), and (c) someone to
    write a WP macro so you can lift out all texts and write them to separate files."
