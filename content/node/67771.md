  I was curious when to use which. Now I've seen someone say to use SemiBold when
  using white on a black background. And of course I know to use Bold when trying
  to emphasize something or Light if its something that needs to be airy, of if the
  font-size is really huge, and perhaps Black if its something that really needs to
  stand out.\r\n\r\nAlso I was curious about the number sizes I've seen also:\r\n100
  = ExtraLight\r\n200\r\n300\r\n400\r\n500\r\n600\r\n700\r\n800\r\n900 = Black\r\n\r\nDoes
  500 = regular?"

  body: "Semibold on reversed background: this is because of human perception. A regular
    font in reverse looks lighter than when viewed \"normally\". There is at least
    one font that comes with 'normal' and 'reverse' versions, where the to-be-used-in-reverse
    version is <em>ever so slightly</em> more bold than the regular variant. (Oh,
    brain! Come on! (thump, thump)... nope.)\r\n\r\nAs to when to use what variant
    ... Whenever you like, I'd say. I can set a book title extra black and very small,
    or large and light ... or exactly the opposite. Whatever looks best. Period. (Generally
    speaking, a small bold title with a large black subtitle does <em>not</em> look
    good.)\r\n\r\nI think the numbering scheme was designed to work around made-up
    weight names -- i.e., \"Semibold\" or \"Demibold\"? \"Regular\" or \"Medium\"
    or \"Book\"? MS Windows <em>pretends</em> to use the numbered Weight for selecting
    an appropriate font, but actually it doesn't -- I always got Regular for a value
    around 500-ish and lower, and Bold for anything higher, and never a Light or Semibold
    or Black font. Mind, that's pre-Windows 7 -- word on the street is WPF has a better
    \"fitting\" algorithm, but I haven't used that as yet."
