  a project for a news organization and I'm looking for something stylish yet professional.
  I really love [[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-60-amor-serif|Amor
  Serif]]. I find such wonderful subtle beauty with this typeface, but it's family
  as a whole is a little limiting. If it had a light, and a black, I would consider.
  As a family, I would hope to find something that would work very large and very
  small.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer humanist and \"modern hybrid\" typefaces. So
  when I search through my personal archives that's all I see to find... go figure.
  \ ;)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. (even pointing me to any
  previous posts or lively relevant discussions)\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\ncmcclain."
