    But that might be an interestingly obscure book, since it doesn&#39;t ring a &#91;strong&#93;

    <BR> <BR>&#62; I just personally am not a huge fan of Goudy. <BR> <BR>I am personally
    a fan of anyone who has the talent, patience, skill and knowledge to create one
    original letterform, not to mention several complete families of entire alphabets
    ... including all of you! <BR> <BR>you are all inspiration for an aspiring type-nerd.

  body: ' The Alphabet and Elements of Lettering isn&#39;t too bad, but it&#39;s not
    really about type design. I only paid $3 for it new &#40;Dover edition&#41; about
    twenty years ago. Of his books, Typologia is better. It gives some insight on
    his methods of designing and producing a font in metal. It&#39;s interesting reading
    even if you don&#39;t care for his designs. '
