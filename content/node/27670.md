body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am currently in the market for a new scanner. The
  reviews at online shops haven't really been helping me much because I am not really
  sure where my standards should be set. Ultimately I want to be able to scan photos,
  patterns and textures for design projects as well as font sketches for typeface
  development. \r\n\r\nI was interested in the Microtek s400, but then I read some
  reviews that called it slow and one even said that it doesn't work with Mac OSX.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone out there have any advice on what I should be looking for? What do you use?
  How do you like it? How much should I expect to spend? Do certain brands work better
  with Macs and Adobe CS?\r\n\r\nI really appreciate any advice or guidance you may
  have,\r\n\r\nDuncan Robertson "

    with SilverFast software. Stay away from the vendor code.\r\n\r\nAlso, Firewire
    is good. Nothing will be fast at high resolutions. There is another scanner thread
    that is recent you might look at."

  body: I recently bought an Epson Perfection 3490 scanner, and it's very good. It
    recieved a lot of positive reviews, and I have no complaints about it so far.
    I don't know if it meets all of your needs, though, but it's something you could
    look into.

    have a MicroTek s400 or i800? I like what I have seen about these 2, but since
    they are not as popular it is difficult to get input from someone other than marketing
    writers. \r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: I have a Microtek, but wouldn't recommend it due to software issues. Had to
    buy Vuescan software in order to use the scanner. Three years later, I'm not aware
    of a software solution from Microtek that's OS X compliant. Hope that helps...

  body: "Vendor code. Sry to be cryptic. Talking about scanning software that is created
    in-house by the manufacturer of the scanner. Many scanners bundle software with
    scanners that is buggy, and if it does work they may not support it so it may
    not work with the next OS upgrade.\r\n\r\nSilverFast is very powerful and can
    make the best of a lower end scanner IMO."

  body: "Well I found a pretty good deal on the Microtek s400 at the store today so
    I went ahead and got it. I've got it hooked up to my PowerBook and everything
    seems to be running nicely. For now I am using the \"Vendor Code\" along with
    Photoshop and my test scans are nice and clear. \r\n\r\nI looked into it and SilverFast
    is available for the s400. Based on jupiterboy's opinion and other reviews I read
    online I am planning to buy SilverFast in the near future. Sounds like that should
    prevent software problems in the future and it should help me avoid \"buggy\"
    bundled software issues.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help. I'll definitely post
    updates if I run into any note-worthy problems or magnificent revelations.\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "It's a good thing. They are great.\r\n\r\nSilverFast is a relaitvely deep
    program. Where most scanners lack is in the ability to pull out details in shadows.
    SilverFast allows you to do all your correction that you might do in photoshop
    directly in the scan. With some practice you will be able to get as much dynamic
    range as you possibly can out of your hardware. Yes, it completely replaces the
    native software, comes with custom transforms for your scanner and interfaces
    with photoshop. It also has little how-to videos that can be activated at various
    stages to help on the learning curve.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whitecube.com/html/artists/gig/gig_frset.html"

    and it works very well for scanning documents and photos, even at obscenely high
    resolutions. I regularly scan at 2400 or 48oo dpi.
