    'Amossa' by NovelFonts. You can see it in the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type
    Faces\". I think I have a sample in the Serif Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    reminds me of the typeface used on the packaging of <a href=\"http://logotypes.designer.am/srch/search.php?way=detailed&id=11816&r=t&a=m&pg=6\">
