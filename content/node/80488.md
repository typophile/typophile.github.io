  all the languages listed below. Apparently she had a version that covered all they
  needed until Czech was added to the mix, and the company they bought that font from
  doesn't exist anymore. I can only find fonts with all the other languages but Russian.
  Is there a version of Trade Gothic that would cover all these languages?\r\n\r\nEnglish
  (EN) \r\nGerman (DE) \r\nFrench (FR) \r\nSwedish (SE) \r\nFinnish (FI) \r\nDanish
