    implies a bit more space between A and D.\r\nThat should do the trick.\r\n\r\n(Kerning
    is balancing the area's between the glyphs. Consider the white space between M
    and I & between A and D \u2014 these should be identical. That's two pairs fixed.
    Now try the same with the other pairs & you'll come to the same conclusion as
    I have.)"

    you, Bert. Is this better?\r\nShould I move \"I\" a bit closer to \"K\"?\r\n\r\nM."

  body: "I had a visual formula based on viewing through the middle of the line.\r\nImagine
    a basic unit of space being a 1 unit. Vertical letters next to each other is 1
    unit of space. A round to a vertical letter would have 3/4 of the unit and round
    to round would be 1/2 of the unit. Just determine how wide 1 unit is."
