body: "Is there a method of moving a design from 2048 to 1024upm that the preserves
  common thicknesses of stroke and symmetry in symmetrical glyphs?\r\n\r\nBy way of
  explanation, I'm designing a font at 2048 but the client wants it at 1000.\r\n\r\n(I
  wish I'd done it at 1000 to begin with, my head hurts.)"

  body: If all your strokes are an even number of units, you will be okay but, failing
    that, you will have rounding issues to correct.

  body: "All my strokes are an even number of units but even then the scale factor
    is 48.828125 which gives rounding problems all over the place.\r\n\r\nAre you
    telling me that you correct all your rounding issues, Chris?"

    pure chaos but I am anal retentive about type.\r\n\r\nTim Ahrens' Remix Tools
    may be of help:\r\nhttp://justanotherfoundry.com\r\n\r\nI just bought it so I
    am not experienced with it yet but take a look at it, yourself."

  body: "Nick, you could change the UPM to 1024 with scaling on as a first step, then
    change it to 1000 without scaling. That changes the relative size of the font
    to the Em, of course.\r\nI also heard that the AFDKO uses hinting information
    to retain stroke weight consistency when scaling."

  body: I think that we're now including the IS (Intelligent Scaling) tool in the
    latest [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/|AFDKO]], which will do what
    you want as long as the output format is PostScript or CFF.
