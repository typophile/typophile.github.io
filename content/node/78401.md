  body: "Hi Mike. Read Christian\u2019s post on the thread. I think the one Wei showed
    us is the same as the one Christian refered to.\r\n\r\n<em>The custom work I twittered
    about was mainly the beautiful hairline blackletter with swashes, called Karl,
    drawn by Berton Hasebe based on Matthew Carter's custom textura and inspired by
    our own Marian, designed by Paul Barnes.</em>"
