  body: "You can find it as:\r\n<strong>Eremitage</strong> by Brendel Informatik (1994)\r\n<strong>Zapotec</strong>
    by NovelFonts (1994)\r\n<strong>Watford DB</strong> or <strong>Watford</strong>
    by SoftMaker (1995)\r\n\r\nbut you should be extra careful on obtaining a license
    to use it in a project, as all of the above companies are well known for their
    font clones/forgeries.\r\nI suspect that all above are clones of the original,
    if somebody knows more about it please enlighten us.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nI
    found them using \"Find my Font\": http://www.findmyfont.com"

  body: The original was Compugraphic's Zarana. I suspect lots of graphics were done
    years ago using Opti's ripoff. Neither can be had digitally and legitimately today,
    though.
