  and in it they have a new Devanagari family called 'Aparajita'. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image_9_5610.png]\r\n\r\nWhen
  I saw this latinized (is it not?) design, this came to mind:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2439855845_70946d2c63_6597.jpg]\r\n\r\nGerry

  if it is, does that matter?"

  body: "I can't say whether or not the typeface is \"latinized.\" It <em>does</em>
    have serifs on it, and it has a stroke contrast that doesn't strike me as one
    common in traditional examples of writing in the Devanagari script.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I can say that in India, there are <strong>a whole lot</strong> of examples of
    contemporary display lettering and display typography including Devanagari letterforms
    that:\r\n\u2013 have serifs\r\n\u2013 and/or have a stroke contrast that isn't
    traditional\r\n\r\nI doubt that anyone expects Aparajita to be used as a text
    face in the way that e.g., most of the ClearType collection of Latin faces from
    a few years back would be used as text faces. As a display face, it might be the
    right note for certain compositions. In the sample you show above, Claus, there
    are a few things happening above the headline that I think should be done a little
    differently. I am going to leave my comments at that, though ;-)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    go so far as to compare it with Romulus Greek, though. Romulus Greek is an exercise
    in the naiv\u2026 it really was intended as a text face, if I have my history
    correct (I am not the biggest JvK-fan\u2026). Seeing as there are already plenty
    of other things that remind me of Aparajita, I don't think the oddity found in
    Romulus Greek applies. But you never know with typographers, calligraphers, artists,
    and professors. Maybe somewhere, some writing expert is smiling at this post in
    that familiar Gerry Leonidas way\u2026"

  body: "Well, I am excited to at least see Microsoft putting out some new non-Latins
    (hello Apple?).\r\n\r\nThis is quite a strange design though. There is a precedent
    for this style of design, there are several others in this genre already used/available.
    However, one would hope/assume that the Microsoft versions will be better drawn
    and engineered with complete character sets.\r\n\r\nDan is right: there are some
    really weird things going on with the character shapes. I don't understand some
    of the decisions made and why it is so consistently inconsistent. At least it
    will be easily ID-able once it starts popping up in everyone's logos :P\r\n\r\nThe
    sloped italics are also unfortunate, especially with the vowel marks that aren't
    aligned properly in the regular italic (the bold ones are better).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRob"

  body: "Actually the serifs aren't the most striking thing to me. The \"modern\"
    contrast is unorthodox, and a little amusing, but not unprecedented. \"Latinized\"?
    Okay, maybe. I certainly see what you mean.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes my eyes most,
    however, (but now, I'm not a native user) is some of the seemingly oversized forms.
    Seems to me like the Indic equivalent of a huge x-height. I mean, look at that
    full-figured <em>ka</em>, the <em>ca</em> almost hitting the roof, and the honking
    loop on the <em>na</em>. I find the angled stroke ending on the <em>ta</em> also
    a little odd.\r\n\r\nBut really, who cares what I [we] think? I suppose the proof
    in the pudding will be how the intended audience of Devanagari users responds."

    It would be very interesting to hear a point of view from a native user of Devanagari
    about this design. I'm very interested to hear about the inspiration / tradition
    / roots for the serifs and modulation/contrast in this design."

    new, and wasn't developed by Microsoft, in case heads start butting! (Feel free
    to challenge this assumption!)\r\n\r\n- http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1700

    - Modular Infotech's font catalog. If you click on the Devanagari pdf, I believe
    Aparajita is samples 0710, 0711, and 0712. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have a feeling
    that it was designed by Karambir Singh Rohilla (if annyone wants to try to track
    him down and ask him).\r\n\r\nYeah, I have seen a myriad of serifed Indic fonts...
    not sure when that trend started to happen. I personally have never liked them
    much, and they of course historically make no sense, in terms of the development
    of the script. This one in particular I just find really hard to read - did they
    HAVE to choose it, out of all Devanagari display faces? Sigh.\r\n\r\n** edit -
    Also just wanted to say that this font has been used quite a bit in India by now
    and wasn't hidden from the public or anything.\r\n\r\n** edit edit - heh.. heh....
    links might work now."

  body: "@Kent\r\nI think that some of the \"x-height\" bigness that you mention is
    ok. It all depends on the size the type is set at! You see this kind of treatment
    often in display type and lettering. Newspaper headlines come to my mind\u2026
    (but I look at a lot of newspapers). Some of the difference is like the difference
    between book hands being written out with a pen, and larger sign lettering being
    painted with a brush.\r\n\r\nSo for a text face, a big round ka like that is probably
    going to be a no no. But in a display face (that is really going to be used at
    display sizes\u2026), I think that it can be appropriate. Again, it depends on
    the usage, just like any sort of typography.\r\n\r\n@Erin\r\nWelcome to Typophile!\r\nGood
    work tracking down Aparajita's info. It is worth noting that most MS faces were
    not developed by Microsoft, but licensed by Microsoft from designers and/or foundries.
    Just look at a list of all the latin fonts bundled with Windows!"

    adding much-needed variety to Devanagari typography. University Roman, Americana
    etc. are not used everyday, but they do add variety to Raman typography. If my
    guess is right this is either a C-DAC creation or a rip-off of one of their designs
    by another type design company (read Modular who names them by numbers!) in India.

  body: "I am sure it was a decision of someone who cannot read, or understand Hindi
    properly. Such designs can only appeal to people who never bothered to read, or
    make meaning out of it. It may look interesting from a foreigners point-of-view,
    but it's not legible at all - nor in text, neither on the display sizes. There
    is no visual consistency in the forms, and skeleton.\r\n\r\nTo me, it's an ugly
    design with a weird set of proportions. It's not even refined properly. I am wondering
    how the complex conjuncts will appear in this design, e.g. in <cite>MRa</cite>
    or <cite>MNa</cite>?  Just analyze the provided sample only; the <cite>MatraI's</cite>
    are not coming properly, the <cite>Anusvara</cite> is too small and going slightly
    off on the letter <cite>Sa</cite> in regular italic (also the <cite>Reph</cite>
    on <cite>Ma</cite> too), the <cite>MatraE</cite> on <cite>Ka</cite> is not centrally
    aligned (neither in upright nor in the italic version), joinery in letter <cite>Sa</cite>
    is detached in Bold version whereas it's connected in the regular version. The
    letter <cite>Na</cite> looks weak in bold version compared to its neighbors. All
    the matra's are detached from the <cite>Shirorekha</cite> (Headline), and it's
    in the middle of nowhere. Also, I have a feeling that the bold and italic versions
    are automated. These are a few errors I noticed in this sample specific, but am
    sure I can point-out more if I see the complete character set. I have seen this
    typeface being used locally and never liked it.\r\n\r\nAs a universal note, when
    we read Devanagari, the <cite>Shirorekha</cite> (Headline) serves as a visual
    guideline like the Serifs do in Latin. But here with both these styles together,
    it breaks the consistency somehow and makes it less legible. Historically also,
    these designs says nothing about the development of Devanagari.\r\n\r\nAnd yes,
    as someone said, it's not a new design. A lot of companies in India, including
    C-DAC, Modular Infotech, Summit Infotech, and  etcetera have been selling it with
    a different name since long. And now am seeing it with a new name, Aparajita.
    Well done, Microsoft! Keep it up! ;-)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBtw, Aparajita in Hindi
    (usually a girl's name) means, the undefeated. "

    design from native speakers and if anything it seems to be one of the preferred
    Devanagari fonts out there. However, as always if there are improvements that
