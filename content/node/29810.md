  kind of thing I am looking for is fonts which appear highly crafted and intricate.
  I know a lot of this sort of thing is done specifically for a particular job, however
  if anybody can suggest and fonts which do this or any reference which demonstartes
  this I would be greatful.\r\n\r\nI found 'Letters'  by Sir Peter Blake which is
  along the lines of what I am looking for:\r\nhttp://www.harleygallery.co.uk/G&C_Exhib_Current.htm\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMarc"
