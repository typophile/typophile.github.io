  body: "It's hard to ID this font since the embroidery obliterates all the fine details.\r\n\r\nIt
    looks a bit like Century Old Style, maybe the embroidering machine couldn't reproduce
    the stroke difference in the letters?\r\n\r\nSomeone else might have a better
    go at this."

  body: Yes I understand embroidery fudges fines details, but I did check out Century
    Old Style and it comes pretty darn close so I may just use it as an alternate
    and hope for the best. Thanks anyway.
