  participating in the book, each with their own spread. Full page illustration to
  the right, name, contact information and a small spot illustration or sketch on
  the left.\r\n\r\nTrying to convince my classmates, who wouldn't be opposed to setting
  the whole book in Arial, that our audience (Art Directors, Creative Directors) will
  be more discriminating of font choice, and that we'll be making a mistake settling
  with a standard Adobe Illustrator/InDesign font.\r\n\r\nI'm partial to Mrs.Eaves.
  Conservative Roman that will sit quietly opposite an illustration, but with artsy
  ligatures that light up when you take a second look. Should complement all styles
  and subjects of illustrations. But it's a hard sell at $299 USD.\r\n\r\nThe title/theme
  is \xB0CELSIUS (as in 'degrees Celsius'). We're the first year graduating from the
  program with a BA. Don't worry, no thermometers in sight for the design.\r\n\r\nSo?
  Any suggestions? Font choice? How to sell them on the idea?"

    will be great, but there are so many practical problems that this job could turn
    into a mine field.\r\n\r\nWhy not try <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html\">Eidetic
    Neo</a> instead? Not that many ligatures, but a very peculiar italic and an intriguing
    Omni unicase variation. It's almost half the price at US$159."

  body: Why is Mrs. Eaves is so difficult to set? I must admit that it's a face that
    I really like - it's got lots of character, but usually when I use it, it looks
    slightly awkward so I avoid it. I can't work out why it's so difficult... is there
    anything to watch out for (i.e. giving extra leading/kerning) in order to set
    it well?

    a fully-featured OpenType family with ornaments and extended ligatures set. <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/PurchaseOptions?familyid=57047&id[]=122074">Esta</a>
    also offers all the trimmings but costs US$30 less because it's still PostScript.

  body: "Well, Mrs Eaves is neither flesh nor fish -- it has the very small x-height
    of a display face but humongous serifs like a micro face, and the kerning is totally
    whacky. You have to customise the parameters quite a bit in order to get it right.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I set Mrs Eaves I apply every single available ligature, but it usually takes
    twice as much work as any other font before I'm satisfied with the results. It's
    a bit like breaking in a wild horse... every - single - time you use it."

  body: "Also from [[Emigre]] is <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/Volume.php?p=UPEMFILFM\">Filosofia</a>,
    their version of Bodoni. Not as many ligatures, but the classy look and feel of
    a modern face (very popular with \"Art Directors, Creative Directors\" ;^) ),
    a truly lovely italic and again an interesting Unicase variant. That one costs
    US$ 149.\r\n\r\nBTW I'm specifically looking for font families in the US$ 150
    price range. Is that OK, or still too much? (Personally I think those families
    are a steal, but then again I understand that you're still a student, so...)"

    maybe the type should be understated so that the focus is primarily on the illustrations
    - wouldn't a sans actually be a good choice in this instance?\r\n\r\nJust a thought.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Thanks very much for sharing your view on Mrs. Eaves - I didn't want to take the
    thread away from the issue at hand, the Mrs. Eaves thing had been bugging me for
    ages - I couldn't miss the opportunity to ask!"

  body: "I second the Clifford suggestion. So warm, understated, strong, and quite
    conservative if that's important. \r\n\r\nDo look among Storm's other things too.
    Lots of solid options and very few are likely to bore an art director. \r\n\r\nI
    haven't been compelled to use Mrs. Eaves, but I have to say I find it somehow
    visually passive-aggressive. I know that sounds ludicrous, but it's the most showy,
    attention-mad face I can think of that's based on a classic, invisible book type.
    I do think there's a conflict built into it between the display and text traits. "

    have something edgy, go for Emigre's Filosofia instead. Or take a lesson from
    museum catalogs of photography and art: use Linotype Sabon with oldstyle figures,
    downloadable for $21 per font from Linotype. You will need only roman, italic,
    and maybe bold. Impeccably clear, elegant, and neutral. Don't get cute with type
    for portfolio showings, just be soign\xE9 and together."

    knew at the time was seeing her, too. Even though she was never faithful to me,
    I stayed faithful to her. I've long sinced moved on to see other typefaces, but
    I'll always have fond memories of our times together. I guess that part of me
    will always be in love with Mrs Eaves.

    mrs eaves might blow your budget and you might not iuse it as much as you think
    cos i have a mate who got an emigre font and he wsa real happy about it, but he
    never actually used it! the project fell through. I underdstand cos it is hard

    and typophiles put them all through the ringer so it can be confusing. SO JUST

    structure, weight and x-height. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nWe found a printer in China that
    might be able to make the book happen for half the price of previous years, so
    there might be some room in the budget for a complementary sans rather than Gill.
    Suggestions?"
