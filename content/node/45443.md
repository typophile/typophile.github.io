  noticed some books from the 1700s, for example this one,\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=sAoPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA3\r\n\r\nput
  part of the first word from the next page at the bottom of each page.  I'd never
  seen this before!\r\n\r\nUsually to learn more about something I type it into Google
  and see what pops up but I have no idea what this technique is called.\r\n\r\nWhat
  was this next-word preview for?  Something to help people who had trouble turning
  the page quickly?\r\n\r\nThis book also has codes like A2, B etc on the last line
  of most pages.  What was this for?  Something help binders put the sheets together?
  \ How did it work?\r\n"

    are made to be read aloud. See John Hudson's contribution at the end of [[http://www.typophile.com/node/43071|this
    thread]]. Don't know if there's a name for it.\r\n\r\n<em>This book also has codes

    printed books.
