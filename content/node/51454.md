  body: "Thanks for posting, Sharon.\r\n\r\nVery inspiring. Some of these types could
    turn out to be really cool and modern if we were to retrace them-especially the
    Sans.\r\n\r\nLove the one with \"Kitazawa booksore\", with Jap Kanji on it -great
    label!\r\n\r\nweng"

  body: These are very nice. So much nicer than all the dead lifeless and boring modern
    sans based designs of today. Thanks for sharing.

    here's a pic showing my concept I will bring to the graphic designer:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newlamoorestamp_6365.JPG]\r\n\r\nthe
    gray square is holding the spot where my mark will go.\r\ni don't want to hijack
    this thread, so i'll post these pics over in the \"critique\" and \"identify\"
    sections, so i can hopefully get some feedback, as well as identify the fonts
    used in the original."
