    has some similarities \u2014 at least in the caps."

  body: "Actually, this is the Caslon's Egyptian I worked on 8 or 9 years ago at Font
    Bureau, working from a revival of William Caslon IV\u2019s Two Lines English Egyptian
    done by Miko McGinty in a type design class taught by Matthew Carter and Tobias
    Frere-Jones in the graphic design master's program at Yale. T was kind enough
    not to use the dreadful lowercase I came up with (custom for Red Herring magazine
    but never used, as far as I know), and the sample in Mario's image just shows
    Miko's caps... I have no idea what the licensing situation is, but I'm sure someone
    at FB can help you out. Antonio, don't you have a digital revival of this face
    available, too?\r\n\r\nThe custom work I twittered about was mainly the beautiful
    hairline blackletter with swashes, called Karl, drawn by Berton Hasebe based on
    Matthew Carter's custom textura and inspired by our own Marian, designed by Paul
    Barnes. I also drew some new light weights of Graphik, used for captions, subheads,
    info graphics, and the occasional sidebar, and Susana Carvalho and Kai Bernau
    added some phonetic characters to Kai's Lyon Text, which are used on a faux-dictionary
    page called \"The Word\"."

  body: "Christian: I do \u2013 it\u2019s called Micerino and it\u2019s based on James
    Mosley\u2019s own Tivoli type \u2013 but I haven\u2019t been working on it for
    a long time, and if worked on it again I\u2019d probably restart from scratch.
    Surprisingly, I seem to get an email about every three or four weeks about it:
    not much, but way more than I expected."
