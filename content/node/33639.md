  for [[FontFont]], 2002\r\n\r\nThe starting point for FF Danubia were typefaces of
  the 18th century. Viktor Solt-Bittner was experimenting with the typical elements
  of classicistic type (like the abrupt change from hairlines to thicker lines) developing
  them further and redrawing them. At times he departed from these models, for instance
  in the basic forms of the italic letters.\r\n\r\nThe lower case letters s, v, w
  and x of many [[didone|didones]] are actually smaller upper case letters. By the
  form of their upstrokes and endings Viktor has tried to adjust them to the other
  lower case letters.\r\n\r\nSince the Renaissance the form of our italic typefaces
  has been based on the handwriting of the 16th century, and while handwriting has
  changed considerably in the course of time these italics haven't. Viktor designed
  FF Danubia Script as an alternative, mainly for display use, based on 18th century
  typefaces like the other FF Danubia fonts.\r\n\r\nFF Danubia is suitable for both
  body and display text. Individual details hardly noticeable in small sizes become
  more evident in larger size, thereby expressing FF Danubia's character.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PreviewScreenSnapz002_5485.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>External
