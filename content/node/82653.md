  to be as the first \"A\" in (A)QUAHOLIQUE.\r\nThe trademark is for boat equipment,
  drink holders etc...\r\nI would like the trademark to have an exclusive feel yet
  a little bit sporty.\r\n\r\nThe endings of the \"A\" can be designed to suit the
  chosen font.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are very appreciated, please see attached image
  for the \"A\"\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A-logo_5583.jpg]"
