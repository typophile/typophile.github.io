  to do enough research to identify the attached typography.\r\n\r\nAny information
  on this (attached) 16th century, Venice type would be appreciated. Furthermore,
  any external information, particularly on Italian (16th cent.) type, would be much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRobert\r\nMalta"
