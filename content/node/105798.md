body: "Clean, legible typography. That's what I always learned and I still believe
  it to this day. I've started to look at children's books, specifically very young
  children (2 - 7),  and the kind of typography used in them. I'm coming to the conclusion
  that most children's book authors don't ever consult with a designer or typographer.
  \r\n\r\nI'm aware that you're dealing with an immature audience but is that an excuse
  to use illegible type? I think not. Perhaps I'm missing something. One of the reason
  I'm here is to find out if I am. \r\n\r\nI decided to embark on a very quick redesign
  of the cover of \"The Trouble With Chickens\" as an experiment. I used H&FJ Knockout.\r\n\r\nThe
  cover on the left is the original. Take a look at the word 'Trouble\". Why is it
  written like it's having a seizure? Do you think that is supposed to be representative
  of the action behind the word? I admit that if you're having a seizure you're in
  trouble, but that's still no excuse for illegible typography.\r\n\r\nMy redesign
  certainly isn't production-ready but it tries to communicate that simplicity is
  more legible the stylized \"Children's type\". \r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reD_5342.jpg]"

    But the typography pairs well with the rendering of the images. Which is also
    somewhat dated."

    the cover? Providing they can read at all, I would bet that they will have no
    problem with it. For example, their handwriting is usually very irregular, and
    they can read it!\r\n\r\nAs James M. notes, ease of reading extended text is another
    matter, but as display, children are perfectly capable of reading a few words
    playfully written. If you doubt it, just test this on a number of children, vs.
    your revision. "

  body: "For the cover of a children's book there is a definite conflict of target
    audiences. Do you go for legibility for the child or do you add some pizzazz to
    look good on the bookstore shelf to the adult who is the actual buyer? I have
    no trouble with some compromise on the cover.\r\n\r\nWilliam Berkson, the target
    audience of readers mentioned by the original poster is ages 2 to 7. This is a
    group, at the lower end, that is just starting to become aware of the significance
    of letters. Thus, the need for legibility, which is most important for those who
    have not quite figured it out yet. Have you done much typographic testing with
    the three year olds? It's very tough."

    Learning]], this book is likely to be appropriate for kids in kindergarten through
    third grade. In kindergarten and first grade, it's probable that it would be an
    adult reading to the child, so your point about legibility for children may not
    apply. Children can, however, be attracted to fun type treatments. Children's
    interest in writing their names different ways, for instance, attests to this.\r\n\r\n\"I'm
    coming to the conclusion that most children's book authors don't ever consult
    with a designer or typographer.\" I don't know what the author has to do with
    this. Children's books are not designed by their authors, any more than other
    books are.\r\n\r\nAbout your redesign \u2014 putting the title in all caps would
    likely make it <em>less</em> legible than the original design. And changing a
    fairly straightforward, if bumpy, typeface for the author into an elaborate swash
    italic definitely doesn't help.\r\n\r\nBesides which, the aesthetic is all wrong.
    Your typefaces don't go with the style of the illustrations. There's nothing playful
    or \"troubling\" about the faces you chose."

  body: "Matt, I was thinking about your topic a lot lately. It is a difficult one,
    because while the books are meant for children, they are bought and read by older
    persons, usually. \r\nI am very annoyed by the typefaces I meet in the books I
    read to my toddler. The kids usually look at the illustration, while the person
    who reads - at the text. I really have difficulties with the readability of the
    body text. Kids do not care about letters so much at this age, but they may be
    attracted by them. So, in the original cover of your posted image, the text is
    more close to the theme then in your redesigned cover, which is toooo serious
    for a 2 to 7 years old child. I agree with previous comments. The whole point
    is to look at the typeface from many points of view. I understand your desire
    for a clean typeface, but the playful note from the kid's world shouldn't disappear.
    \r\nI had a chance to discuss with some publishers and asked them how they choose
    \ the typeface (in my case the Greek one). They answered that the final goal is
    to find a similar Greek typeface with the original English or French... I had
    in mind to talk to some of them about it. So if you want, I could ask who is choosing
    the typeface in the first place and based on what criteria. \r\nAre you interested
    in the legibility of the cover's typeface or the readability of the body text?\r\n"

  body: ">ages 2-7\r\n\r\nI overlooked that, sorry. In that case, the typography is
    mainly for the adults who read the book to the child. But at the upper end, I
    still don't think the 'trouble' would present any significant extra difficulty
    for the child. We decipher letters by their structure, and the irregularities
    of baseline our brains, including children's brains, are easily able to filter
    out. It is only in extended text that uniformity becomes an important advantage.
    In display type\u2014and a children's book may be display type even on the inside,
    if it has few words\u2014the extra effort of filtering out irregularities is so
    minimal that it doesn't matter. "

    me 'what this is', showing to the big letters (3rd image) \"THE END\". The funny
    thing is that afterwards I told him these are letters and named them, he made
    a game, trying to find words which begin with these letters. So maybe, in some
    way, typography does matter even for 2 years old kids:) \r\nI should mention that
    this book is A3 format and \"THE END\" words are displayed on a such leaf. It
    was inevitable to attract anybody's attention. \r\nI would say that flexibility
    could be the guide for the typography in the case of children's book. You never
    can predict children's behavior, so is futile to set rules... :)\r\n\r\nI inserted

  body: "I think you are all correct about the cover art typography but I struggle
    to work with highly stylized typefaces. They just all look terrible to me. Perhaps
    the styling of the word itself will appeal more to a small child than how the
    word reads. It's an important part of the book because if the child picks it up
    they will most likely ask their parents to buy it based on the cover. I don't
    think the cover art would influence the parents decision one way or the other
    quite frankly. \r\n\r\nOn the subject of the parents, I don't believe the typography
    is specifically for parents though. I'm leaning towards Gotham for the body copy
    typography. Although there's no chance a great typeface will win over a great
    illustration from a child's point of view, a children's book for me is still about
    learning to read and write through an entertaining story. I want to choose something
    very clear and geometric. I feel that it's important for a child to recognize
    the shapes of letters, when learning to read and write. The body copy typeface
    is slightly off topic, sorry.\r\n\r\nThanks again for everyone's input."

    words are given life by playful letter shapes. And since this book is an illustrated
    Children's book I would expect more lively rendered action words throughout the
    book.\r\n\r\nFascinating stuff comparing the original cover with your example.
    \ \r\n\r\nYou seemed to have assigned the typography and the illustration onto
    a two column grid ...to me that is very interesting indeed. Even within the lower
    text block you have center aligned the text, whereas in the original lower text
    block the words THE and WITH are offset vertically.  \r\n\r\nThe interaction between
    typography and illustration in the original cover is worth noting ...they are
    of each other. Having the eyebrow of the dog horizontally aligned with the illustrators
    name and having the whole text block placed in a position so as to have a relationship
    between both the dog and the chickens, in other words the entire illustration,
    is very interesting indeed. And having a feather rest on the N is reenforces the
    direct relationship of typography and illustration for a Children's book. \r\n\r\nIn
    your rendering the action word is gone, the text blocks are placed in rank and
    file, and white space floods the overall effort.\r\n\r\nFor me, as a graphic designer,
    comparing these two examples is totally interesting ... "

    of \"information\", because we communicate on a lot of levels besides written
    language. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, at the end to the day it is quite difficult to
    design something  like a book cover that is actually illegible - without specifically
    intending to do so. Go ahead. design an aesthetically pleasing version of this
    cover that cannot be read. A children's book isn't a highway sign or a medicine
    bottle meant to be read by demented old people with stinkingly bad eyesight. (I
    can say the because I'm \"that far\" from being one myself.)\r\n\r\nSuch a design
