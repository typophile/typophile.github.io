body: That title is just a placeholder - I'm looking for the right term, if there
  is one. Is there a name for the small decorations placed to either side of titles,
  or between lines of text? Particularly in Victorian and Edwardian publications,
  posters, catalogues, and so on. I'm looking for some for a project I'm working on,
  and being rather hampered by not knowing what they're properly called.

    me! I know we were thought of as \"slackers\" at Agfa, but I worked on the promo
    material when we released the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=sackers\">Sackers
