  I realize that there is WAY TOO MUCH going on here, so any help would be warmly
  appreciated, as you would be helping put bread on my table.  \r\n\r\nOne thing I
  am trying to keep in mind is that these cards are going to be in business people's
  hands as well as for families and non-profits, I ask myself \"what would I be looking
  for in a photographer's business card?\"\r\n\r\nYou can view it <a href=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a45/jboaston/promotional/buscard.jpg\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for all of your help"

  body: I think the question now is what are the priorities that you need? There should
    be a larger contrast between the elements in your card. Is this card going to
    be double-sided? It may give you extra space if it is printed double-sided if
    you know what I mean.

    body: "The first thing that you have to consider is the cards PURPOSE.... and
      that it's a business card...not a brochure or info card. It's acting to provide
      your contact details.... that's it. Currently there is just TO MUCH information.\r\n\r\nTherefore
      it should only display your business name / logo and contact details. I'd also
      print these elements on different sides (logo/ logotype on one sie and contact
      details on the other) to keep it clean (tm) :D\r\n\r\nAs for the fonts.....
      there are to many. I'd use no more than two (and pref one + logo/ logotype).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
      you are wanting to advertise your services, maybe get a brochure designed to
      accompany the card or focus the attention to a website. Talking of which.. i'd
      get a \"proper\" email address... as gmail/ hotmail/ yahoo email accounts tend
      to make businesses/ individuals look \"temporary\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember it's
      PURPOSE :D Good luck!\r\n"

  body: The best place to start is to establish a hierarchy of information, then select
    one typeface that says it all. The different styles within that face can add emphasis.

  body: "Start with a logo, it could be a very simple device your current one would
    not impress many business clients, I think you might consider trading your services
    with a designer rather than working it up yourself. \r\nLook at what you need/expect
    from a business card, I would suggest you need something with your business name/logo,
    your name (clients prefer to have a named contact), your contact details, and
    (possibly on the reverse) products offered, for example, portraits, product shots
    etc, the products offered section is, depending on the circumstances of giving
    your card, optional the less extraneous information, the better opportunity to
    make a strong layout. I really wouldn't use any of the typefaces you have on your
    sample they don't in any way combine. You should also investigate using colour.\r\nTim"

    assemble such an array of incongruous elements in so small a space is little short
    of miraculous.\r\n\r\nWhen I need a photograph I seek the services of an appropriate
    photographer. What you are in need of is what is known as a corporate identity
    - I urge you engage the services of an appropriate designer.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't
    cost too much of your bread, and may help put some jam on it in the long run.</strong>"

  body: "</strong>Q. <em>\u201Cwhat would I be looking for in a photographer\u2019s
    business card?\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nA. An absolutely drop-dead gorgeous photograph.
    Possibly of a business subject (ie. people, communication, co-operation, commerce).
    Full colour. Full bleed. Beautifully printed. Occupying an entire front side of
    the business card and eloquently stating that it represents the proverbial thousand
    words while illustrating a cogent point of difference from all the other photographers
    hustling for work.\r\n\r\nYou can put your minimum contact details on the reverse
    of the card \u2013 email plus mobile phone number. In a single typeface, in a
    single size, in a single colour and tone. Anything else is likely to be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nPS.
    What's with the unwarranted bold on this thread? Someone forget to close a tag?"
