  it worth continuing?      <BR>     <BR>I know we have a s&#42;&#42;&#42;load of
  humanist sans serif typefaces already,but I sort of liked how it turned out.     <BR>     <BR>COmments

    <BR>r is definitely wide. <BR>o seems a bit pointy, as if you needed to pull the
    <BR>BCPs a little farther from the nodes. The same <BR>goes for the bottom bowl
    of the g which is BTW <BR>too dark.  <BR>i&#39;s dot should be higher. <BR>s needs

  body: '&#62;I&#39;m not sure whether n,m,u,h are too wide or they just appear like
    that because they&#39;re tight.  <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t this contradictive? Or do
    you mean that the spacing is tight,and therefore they look too wide? <BR> <BR>&#62;r
    is definitely wide.  <BR> <BR>Yeah, fixed. <BR> <BR>&#62;o seems a bit pointy,
    as if you needed to pull the BCPs a little farther from the nodes. The same goes
    for the bottom bowl of the g which is BTW too dark.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not based
    ona super elipse, rather a &#42;slightly&#42; modified true circle... G was too
    dark though. <BR> <BR>&#62;i&#39;s dot should be higher.  <BR> <BR>Saw that also,
    I fixed it last night. <BR> <BR>&#62;s needs a lot of work.  <BR> <BR>I scrapped
    the &#39;s&#39;.. reworked it completely, update whenI have some more characters
    to show. <BR> <BR>&#62;Even though there are similar faces, if you manage to instill
    some character and personality, why not?  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a my problem, how
    &#34;quirky&#34; should it be? I mean,there&#39;s million of uses for a &#34;bland&#34;
    sans serif... but there are also millions of bland sans serifs. oh well, I guess
    I&#39;ll just haveto finish it. <BR> <BR>&#62;For example: see the use Irma Boon
    has made of Frank Blokland&#39;s Documenta Sans - a face similar to this and not
    overused - in her Treumann book. The fact that it&#39;s not Gill Sans or the other
    staples gives it a special freshness.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll check.... URL? <BR> <BR>&#62;God&#39;s
    in the details. <BR> <BR>He sure is.'

  body: I adore the uppercase &#39;Q&#39; and &#39;R&#39;... Nice. How nice with a
    Serif and a Sans in the same family. I like that.

    meant.  <BR>  <BR><i>[o] It&#39;s not based on a super elipse, rather a &#42;slightly&#42;
    modified   <BR>true circle...</i>  <BR>  <BR>Well, OK, but it still looks a bit
    egg-shaped to me, especially  <BR>at north and south.  <BR>  <BR><i>That&#39;s

    that it doesn&#39;t need  <BR>to be quirky at all to have personality and make
    an effect. The  <BR>only quirky detail in Documenta Sans is exactly the only thing
    that  <BR>bothers me in the face: the very narrow disconnection of the  <BR>P&#39;s
    bowl, which is truly irrelevant.'
