body: "When I think about type in a global sense, there are many things that come
  to mind..\r\nSeeing that so many different cultures write in different ways, it's
  easy for people judge others just by the particular type they use when communicating.
  For instance, especially in today's world, when one sees someone writing in Arabic
  they are automatically jarred and become overwhelmed with a sense of doubt. However,
  the shoe could also be worn on the other foot if people who wright in Arabic see
  someone writing in English. Some people see beauty in other styles of writing, others
  consider it a flag of aggressive behavior. The different types and fonts used by
  people all over the world can either amaze the the intelligent or intimidate the
  simple minded."
