  I'm totally intrigued by the spurred \"3\" on it. I'm not even sure if I like it
  or not. It just seems so unnecessarily unique.\r\n\r\nDoes this belong to a family
  to which any of you are familiar, or is this some custom thing where someone thought
  they were being crafty (and completely spoiling the counter on the three)?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8083_3997.png]"

    should read E808.

    in the orientation as posted."
