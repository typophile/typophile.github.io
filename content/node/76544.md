  [EDIT: They have since been removed until we have a better reason to use them.]
  I've turned on voting, but ultimately what we do with this is up to all of us. As
  Typophile continues to grow with hundreds of thousands of pieces of content, we're
  going to need some new tools to start to sift signal from noise. A few of my initial
  thoughts and ideas on how we might want to use this...\r\n\r\nUPvotes\r\n- View
  quality content, not just the stuff that's popular\r\n- See top voted content by
  day, week, month, all time\r\n- Users with lots of upvotes on their content get
  status within the community.\r\n- Type ID: The community identifies who solved the
  ID, which could feed into a leaderboard.\r\n- Content recommendations: Typophile
  suggests other content that is similar to the stuff you've upvoted.\r\n\r\nDOWNvotes\r\n-
  The community downvotes trolls, griefers, spammers and the comments gray out. \r\n-
  Enough community downvotes and the comment disappears entirely.\r\n- Typophile filters
  content out that you're not interested in based on your voting history.\r\n\r\nHow
  would _you_ like to see voting results used to enhance your Typophile experience?\r\n\r\n//jared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Sounds good. Typophile is a wonderful website, but the one thing that botheres
    me is the search engine. In my opinion it just doesn't work very well. If you
    want to get to all the different content, a good search engine is important. This
    might be a bit off topic, but to me this is more important than the voting. Hope
    this helps. Keep improving typophile!

    it adds. I'm a little confused that up-votes help you see 'quality content, not
    just stuff that's popular' \u2014 wouldn't the up-votes indicate popular stuff?
    \r\n\r\nAgree with Jasper re search engine."

    Search\" tab in the search results. For the moment, you'll have to reenter your
    search terms, but you'll stay on Typophile.\r\n\r\nDirect access to search is
    also here: http://typophile.com/search/google/\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm glad to see some new activity as far as improvements to Typophile! Much
    like others here, though, voting means less to me than my <a href=http://typophile.com/node/70259>previously
    stated feature requests</a> would.

    re-instate that really small and extremely useful feature: the back/next links
    in threads?"

  body: The voting was an experiment, in the spirit of an active prototype - but I
    think we'll go ahead and turn it off until we've got a solid reason to use it,
    and a payoff where you see results. Thanks everyone for feedback.
