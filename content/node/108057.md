  much of the tech details of creating a font, so please excuse my noobness.\r\n\r\nI've
  created [[http://pixelambacht.nl/2013/font-face-render-check/|a little check to
  see if <code>font-face</code> is supported]] by a browser. For this I created a
  TTF file that contains one single glyph, which metrics I check with JavaScript to
  confirm it actually rendered. I created this font as follows:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>I
  drew the glyp (a very wide rectangle) and created a one-glyph font with [[http://icomoon.io/|the
  Icomoon icon font application]]</li>\r\n<li>I stripped all metadata (or reduced
  mandatory metadata to a single character) using a free tool called TTFEdit</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n[[https://github.com/RoelN/font-face-render-check/tree/master/dev|This
  results in a TTF file of just 836 bytes.]] I was wondering if I could bring the
  file size down any further.\r\n\r\nI tried the following:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Set
  the glyph to the space character (as this is a mandatory \"glyph\" in the Icomoon
  tool, so it technically contains two glyps together with my custom one). But is
  seems Windows (or at least Chrome on Windows) doesn't allow for this and shows an
  empty space instead of the glyph you put in your font</li>\r\n<li>Convert to WOFF,
  which results in a file of 660 bytes but is supported by fewer browsers than TTF</li>\r\n<li>Edit
  the font in FontForge, some other freeware tools, and online apps in an attempt
  to strip more data. The resulting file was alwas bigger when saved.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI
  looked for (Linux command line) tools that would allow me to strip the space glyph,
  tables or further (meta)data from the file. The glyph doesn't have to be pretty,
  so I could sacrifice stuff like kerning or hinting data. But I can't find any tool
  that allows me to do this.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what else I could try? "

    and the last point in the hyphen glyph is a duplicate of the first one.\r\n\r\nBy

    means that even the dedicated browsers, if employed with OpenType Sanitiser or

    little dirty hack of overlaid entries]]. Here\u2019s how it goes.\r\n\r\nIf the
    only subtable is a subtable format zero and it has a length of 8 bytes (that\u2019s
    the minimum on OS X at least), you get the whole cmap table as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>0x0000
    0x0001 Version, no. of subtables\r\n0x0000 0x0000 Platform, encoding\r\n0x0000
    0x000C Offset to the subtable\r\n0x0000 0x0008 Subtable\u2019s format, length\r\n0x0000
    0x0000 Rest of the subtable</code></pre>\r\n\r\nNow here\u2019s the trick: you
    can make the offset entry point onto the eighth byte, that is, back onto the offset
    entry itself, and reuse it as the subtable\u2019s format and length. In other
    words, make the subtable overlap the offset entry:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>0x0000 0x0001
    Version, no. of subtables\r\n0x0000 0x0000 Platform, encoding\r\n0x0000 0x0008
    Offset / Subtable\u2019s format, length\r\n0x0000 0x0000 Rest of the subtable</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThis
    produces no complains both from Font Book and the Font Tools on OS X. It\u2019s
    also completely valid as far as the spec is concerned. I\u2019m curious how such
    backward-pointing offsets behave on other platforms as well if anyone is willing
    to do some experiments. Hand crafting in hex will be necessary, I suppose, as
    higher-level font assemblers normally don\u2019t do this."

    currently have no mechanism to tell you whether an @font-face font is genuinely

    or generate on a page, rather than as download, to style a stretch of text as
    \"desired font, tiny font\". As long as the text dimensions match the tiny font's,
    we know the desired font -despite even possibly already being done downloading-
    is not available for text styling yet. Amusingly, even if a webfont is available
    for page styling, if it is also used inside a canvas, it will need to be checked
    for again because the browser now needs to load it into a different graphics context.
    Having the tiniest of fonts available there helps.\r\n\r\nAnd of course once you
