body: Does anyone know of a commonly available (i.e., one that comes already loaded
  into a word processing program) font that utilizes a dollar sign [$] with two (2)
  complete (not partial, with the middle lacking) vertical strokes, instead of the
  far more common (nowadays) single stroke, or even partial single stroke?  Or better
  yet, is there an ASCII code (?) in the form of "Alt 0nnn") for such a symbol?  Or,
  last resort, does anyone know how to "build" the symbol I've described using an
  upper case S, and overtyping with vertical bars of some sort?  Thanks.
