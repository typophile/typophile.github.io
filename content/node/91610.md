body: Hello everybody! Im new here, nice to meet you. Im starting my own streetwear
  label called the "Ides of March". I created my own logo for it but think it may
  be a little bit lacking. My wife seems to think the logo is missing that "something"
  so I may be coming to a realization of changing the logo. However, everyone here
  seems very insightful and knows their design so I wanted to get you take on it.
  Please don't hold back, I can take it. Any advice or insight would be very much
  appreciated. Unfortunately my work's internet prevents me from uploading the image,
  you can check it out on www.BewareTheIdes.com. It's the large "I" with a crown logo
  on the main page, you cant miss it lol. Thanks, I'll upload an image when I get
  home.

    look, but in terms of execution (and\r\ninsight into graphic design) it's rare
    for that same person\r\nto also have the necessary talent.\r\n\r\nErgo: you should
    hire a designer.  :-)\r\nWhich is not to say you/he shouldn't look to Typophile
    for help.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      my budget at the time. Plus, I kinda want that feeling of self accomplishment
      of designing the logo myself :P.  '

  body: "As long as you don't mind losing money with a less-than-ideal logo...  :-/\r\nAs
    the saying goes, you have to spend money to make money.\r\n\r\nTwo other points:\r\n1)
    Although there are talented graphic designers who frequent\r\nTypophile, we're
    mostly focused on letterforms, and in your logo\r\nthere's only one, plus it's
    a simple one. So as things stand you\r\nmight not get very fruitful feedback.\r\n2)
    Context is everything. You know what your product is about,\r\nbut for a third-party
    to help you he would need to know a lot more\r\nabout the nature of the clothing,
    the potential customers, etc.\r\n\r\nIn any case, good luck.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Sami, I'm certainly not an expert on street art, graffiti, etc., but to me
    your logo lacks the energy and spontaneity needed to reflect that type of art.
    Your logo is very symmetrical, precise, etc. I'd suggest going back to the drawing
    board and try to create a logo that looks more like street art. The "ides" art
    on your Kickstarter page that has more of a grunge look is maybe a step in the
    right direction.

    body: Hello, thanks for the insight, I did decide to go back to the drawing board
      and see what else I could come up with.

    body: WOW, those are some pretty cool designs, I liek em. Thanks for the feedback.
      The crown looks a little too much like a paper hat but I do like the direction
      and appreciate the fact you took time to do this. This is definetley some good
      inspiration. Thank you once again.

  body: "Interesting that all I did was extend the lines of your crown to create tension
    and depth then tilted the crown for attitude. The crown has been done to death
    even I've used in reference to JMB, but somehow the paper hat / crown has more
    of an in-your-face street innocence and rebellion not to mention a youthful quality,
    all-be-it from by a by gone era. And even still a modern twist on the paper hat
    just might be long over due. And and, if you get the right model with the right
    attitude it would work.\r\n\r\nIf you want the design - go for it! My compliments.
    Just keep that top left corner of the I peaking through, it balances with the
    tilt and is a nice detail to emphasize attitude.  \r\n\r\nThe top left version
    would be awesome done in the nappy collegiate patch style.\r\n\r\nGood luck, glad
    to help.\r\n\r\nn."

  body: I'm having trouble parsing the I as a letter; it looks like the cross-section
    of a steel girder to me. Is that intentional? Otherwise, how about varying the
    stroke width, or maybe slightly tapering the serifs.

    body: It is intentional, I wanted a stronger and bolder looking "I" so I wanted
      to steer clear of curves and what not. I may play with the stroke width though,
      thanks!

    bold 'I', everything goes along well. Try transforming this into something that
    you would not have imagined -- a lower case 'I', for example.\r\n"
