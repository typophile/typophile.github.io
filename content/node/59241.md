  Test Results/Certificate page. It's my first UI design for a high traffic website.\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\nhttp://www.odesk.com/exams/Certified-English-Sentence-Structure-Experts_81555\r\n\r\nUpdated:\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/odesk/code/\r\n\r\nBasically
  they wanted the page to be more \"certificate like\", without being too cheesy.
  Simplicity and limited image usage was also a priority.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"
