body: "Stephen, Yves, the Fontshop gang... I have a question about perusing the font
  catalogues on Fontshop.com \r\n\r\nFor how massive Fontshop's collection is, it's
  browsing features seem rudimentary and simplified. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to display
  more than 20 results? Is it possible to change the sample text so that when I go
  to the next page it doesn't change back to \"AaBbCc Handgloves\" at 36pts? Is it
  possible to sort by anything other than alphabetically? \r\n\r\nI'm using Firefox,
  so maybe these inabilities are indicative to this browser.\r\n\r\nThis is by no
  means a cut on Fontshop and it's features. I love Fontshop, it's one of the largest
  collections and the look and blog features are excellent. I'm just curious if these
  defaults can be changed, or if Fontshop is considering adding advanced font browsing
  features in the near future. "

  body: "Fontshop's browser has much improved, but what I find difficult and confusing
    is that it displays fonts in terms of available packages. So if you do a search
    for Meta, for example, you get all the various ways Meta is available for purchase,
    but it's difficult to just get a view of all the different cuts of Meta. Whereas
    at myfonts.com you can see the entire family without having to wade through the
    different packages. Purchase options is an additional link (which in this case
    sends you to Fontshop's rabbit hole of purchase options). In terms of straightforward
    viewing of the font, it's much easier.\r\n\r\nIt took me forever recently to figure
    out how to license the expert collection for Meta Normal, I wish it had been simpler."

  body: We love Fontshop. And Stewf has always welcomed suggestions to improve it.
    I'd love to make it my "go to" site to look at fonts but right now it's just too
    busy for me.

    creative. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm sure ample amounts of admiration to the Fontshop crew
    and site are always welcome."
