  Internet board. I'm a second year student in a design program, and I'm trying to
  get feedback on this branding I'm finishing up. \r\n\r\nCompany is called Mixtape
  Union. It's a site that's all about reviving the mixtape in all it's glory, not
  just sharing playlists. I didn't want to do something that was so obvious and retro...
  that's the first tendency for a lot of people. I wanted to give it its own feel.
  \r\n\r\nAnyway, the logo, type, and stationery are all here. I'm new to typography
  and all, so keep that in mind. Feel free to be harsh about your critiques."

    large. you don't need to fill the space with type for it to be 'effective' (learn
    to lvoe white space.)\r\nYou've also got a load of fonts going on there. cut them
    back.\r\n\r\nthe actual design is quite nice (and clever - the angled panel),
    I'd love to see some development on it. I mean ... surely the card is crying out
    for it (as a start...to play with). ;-)\r\n\r\nwell done.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: "Thanks for the feedback Ratbaggy. Quite useful. Just for clarifications sake...
    which type do you feel like is a bit large. I'd be interested in going back and
    reworking some of your ideas to see if I can catch your drift. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again.\r\n\r\n"

    that. At the very least I'd use the same weight for Mixtape and Union in the logo.\r\n\r\nAlso
    I don't get the upside down lollipop thingy in the mark.\r\n\r\nThe business card
    is nice, especially the B side .. oh, oh .. I get it now, lol, the B side :) ..
    anyhow .. but the name/position look a bit too large for comfort.\r\n"

  body: "I think you've utilized some good techniques, but I'm not sure the overall
    vibe is right for \"mixtapes\" (at least not as I know them). I would consider
    the underlying mood/vibe/style goal before spending time on fine tuning.\r\n\r\nA
    few notes...\r\n\r\n1. The overall vibe seems a bit clean and clinical.\r\n\r\n2.
    The color scheme (blue/grey/white/black) is cold.\r\n\r\n3. The logo font could
    use more personality.\r\n\r\n4. Icons seem a bit too info graphic style.\r\n\r\n5.
    Where is the fun?\r\n\r\nTapes are analog, and this feels cold and digital. Aren't
    mixtapes about piecing together random bits of music, and doing a quick handmade
    cover and labels?\r\n\r\nOr are we talking about a different kind of mixtapes?"

    but agree it could be more playful. Mixtapes suggest a very DIY feeling \u2013

    wow \u2013 now I can see that those are HEADS! Thanks. Maybe that could be clearer.
    Or I'm just being dense. All I saw was a \"tape\" symbol with grass or something
    sprouting from it, and a lollipop UFO.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I agree it's well made
    and looks slick, but maybe too slick, clean &amp; digital for the project at hand.
    I understand you don't want to make it too obvious, but at the moment it seems
    possibly too generic/exchangeable."

  body: "Your feedbacks are awesome! I love this forum. \r\n\r\nYeah, you ever get
    into a design project and have an idea... get attached to it and aren't willing
    to tell yourself to let go and start over? I think that's what happened here.
    \r\n\r\nI thought to myself, \"everytime someone thinks about mixtapes they have
    the same ideas and mental imagery\". I wanted to merge a newer look with a classic
    idea. At the end of the day, maybe it's just miscommunicating the purpose...\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    thanks so much. I'm working with it. "
