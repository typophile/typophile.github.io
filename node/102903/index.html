<p>If I were you I’d reference the Chicago Manual of Style and take what you will from there.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate student myself, most professors don’t worry much about typographic correctness—the focus is on more general style laws such as correct quoting and citing.</p>
<p>Simply pick an appropriate style, such as MLA or APA, and tell the students to follow that.</p>
<p>Unless it is a paper on typography or design, then of course be sure to look for good leading, em/en dashes, correct curly quotes, etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Variations on this question come up a lot, and I think they often result from a misunderstanding of what typography actually is, which is the design of a finished text for publishing or distributing. There is manuscript formatting (<em>typing</em>), which is practiced by authors; and then there is design (<em>typography</em>), which is practiced by typographers, typesetters, and graphic designers.</p>
<p>An academic essay should follow some standard <em>manuscript format</em>, which is completely different from the design of a well typeset published text. &ldquo;Ugliness&rdquo; would not be a concern of mine in this situation — not until one of these essays goes to press in a journal. Then I would care.</p>
<p>In an academic setting, papers should be double-spaced with 1 inch margins in some boring old normal font on 8.5 x 11 paper. This is a vaguely old-fashioned view and not everyone will agree with it, but I would not encourage students to &ldquo;design&rdquo; manuscripts. Leave that to the book designer whose hands the manuscript eventually winds up in.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>[sorry for the non-English answer, but I am focusing some issues very specific to Brazilian academic norms, known as “ABNT rules”, and it would need somewhat longer English explanations to make sense for other typophiles.]</em></p>
<p>Youssef, entendo sua preocupação porque também não gosto das normas da ABNT. Elas já eram ruins antes e ficaram ainda piores com a atualização de 2002-2003. Tenho certeza que ninguém na ABNT conhece um mínimo de tipografia ou editoração, mas ainda assim determinam como milhares de estudantes têm de formatar seus trabalhos.</p>
<p>Já o manual de Chicago é uma referência mais ou menos universal e muito bem feita, muito superior à ABNT. O problema é que os estudantes já têm dificuldade para aplicar as normas da ABNT e não acho que trocar um conjunto de regras por outro vá ajudar no seu caso. Mesmo que houvesse uma versão traduzida e simplificada das normas de Chicago, creio que isso só confundiria os acadêmicos. Além disso, certos aspectos do sistema americano são bem estranhos para os nossos hábitos.</p>
<p>O que eu faria no seu caso seria editar um desses manuais que as faculdades fornecem sobre as normas da ABNT usadas pela instituição. Removeria todas as regras e detalhes excessivamente rígidos e desnecessários, fazendo uma orientação simples. Exemplo: a entrelinha com espaçamento duplo é uma aberração, resquício das máquinas de escrever e de quando o professor anotava as correções no espaço <em>entre</em> as linhas. Hoje, o professor não está limitado às linhas em branco, pode mandar observações por email ou mesmo colocar notas diretamente no arquivo digital, em cor ou tipo diferente. Assim, a entrelinha dupla pode (e deve) ser dispensada.</p>
<p>Por outro lado, acrescentaria algumas regras tipográficas flexíveis. Por exemplo: quanto às fontes, orientar o uso de apenas uma serifada em todo documento ou uma serifada nos textos em geral e uma não serifada nos títulos e subtítulos, apresentando uma lista de fontes a escolher (já que dificilmente o pessoa saberia o que é “serifada”). Quanto à separação silábica, reiterar que ela deve ser usada. Quanto ao alinhamento, usar o justificado no texto em geral, mas permitir o centralizado em títulos e subtítulos. Coisas assim.</p>
<p>Ficaria ainda melhor se no manual você incluísse breves notas explicando porque determinado critério deve ser observado. Por exemplo: a fonte serifada é melhor para leitura imersiva porque as letras são melhor diferenciadas e a visão, que se cansa com a leitura, é favorecida quando não é preciso fazer esforço para distinguir um n de um ri ou um l de u I (problemas típicos das não serifadas). Assim, os alunos são seguiriam as regras apenas porque o professor determinou, mas adeririam a elas porque há um motivo lógico para serem adotadas.</p>
<p>Aproveitando o exemplo da entrelinha: se o espaço duplo é horrendo e prejudicial à leitura (um texto visualmente rarefeito contraria o fluxo de atenção), tampouco é adequado usar linhas muito estreitas. Basta lembrar aos alunos quantas vezes eles já não estavam lendo um jornal ou revista e, ao terminar a linha, seus olhos recomeçaram a ler a mesma linha e não a seguinte. Isso indica entrelinha muito apertada, coisa típica de jornais, e deve ser evitada com uma folga, usualmente de 20% da altura do texto. Um explicação dessas seria um alento para a nossa educação.</p>
<p>Quanto ao sujeito que respondeu de maneira grosseira, o melhor é ignorá-lo. Não é de hoje que a criatura em questão tumultua as discussões por aqui. Felizmente, há muitas pessoas com conhecimento e educação e com essas eu sempre aprendo bastante. Se você achar que posso ajudar de alguma outra forma, basta escrever para contato arroba if ponto pro ponto br.</p>

<p>I agree with the notion that there should typically be a standard format for all submissions, required by whomever is receiving them and will be marking them. This is a simple expedient for ensuring that all students have conformed to the length requirement of the submission.* But I also think that this standard format should serve some functional purpose relative to how it will be handled. The old &lsquo;double-spaced with 1 inch margins&rsquo; format is, as Joshua suggests, related to manuscript submission requirements for publication, so in the context of academia was a good way to condition graduate students to producing such manuscripts. The format is designed to enable copy editing between the lines of text. It was introduced in the context of typewriter copy, however, and ignores the ease with which computer documents are reformatted these days. So I think it is entirely reasonable for a teacher to consider different formats, but this should be done not in in terms of ugliness or beauty, but in terms of usefulness. How does the teacher intend to engage with the document? Will he or she be marking grammatical and other textual problems? If so, there remains some merit in the double-spaced requirement, since what the teacher will be doing is akin to copy editing. But these days how many teachers regularly mark student submissions in this way (how many, frankly, are qualified to do so)? If the kind of written feedback a teacher provides addresses content, then a wider margin on one side is going to be more useful than double-spacing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@John, I agree I should think about usefulness. On the other hand, many &ldquo;manuals&rdquo; of style I&rsquo;ve come across don&rsquo;t follow their own rules. It&rsquo;s hard to be consistent &ndash; especially when people are trying to focus on content &ndash; but typographical inconsistencies tend to distract the reader.</p>
<p>I guess an option of 1,5 spacing or 20%+ leading would be sensible, or am I off the mark here?</p>
<p>While I must confess I (and some other people) do that grammar and textual revision, most don&rsquo;t. Many professors don&rsquo;t even check if it complies to the formatting rules, &ldquo;more or less&rdquo; is always accepted.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s always a4 or letter paper, so I wonder if margins could be wider too (currently 2cm right and bottom; 3cm left and superior).</p>

"cor preta" means "black", and "tamanho 12" mean "size 12" ... 12 points. Most readers can't tell the difference between Times New Roman and lots of serif fonts, but if the spacing is not chosen as the one given by Times, my guess is that it will be noticed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>An academic essay should follow some standard manuscript format, which is completely different from the design of a well typeset published text. "Ugliness" would not be a concern of mine in this situation — not until one of these essays goes to press in a journal. Then I would care.</blockquote>
<p>The notion of an academic <em>journal</em> is a strange one. I say this as someone who has both typeset a number of scholarly journals for an extended period of time &ndash; over ten years with some journals &ndash; and as one who has designed them.</p>
<p>The difficulties arise with authors, and editors who have sense enough to recognize something special, and let it by.</p>
<p>Within the text, over that 10 years, you&rsquo;ll have prose extracts that contain within them subheads, verse extracts. lists &ndash; whatever can be written can be quoted. In the current journal, what&rsquo;s the style for these elements?</p>
<p>Someone will occasionally think it important to have epigraphs to their subheads.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have numbered lists within bulleted lists. Etc.</p>
<p>Essentially, whatever complication anyone can think of will occur.</p>
<p>Chapter openings perforce contain an article title and author (or two or three or five). But some will use a subtitle, some an epigraph, and/or a dedication, and/or a text opening subhead &ndash; and occasionally, all these elements &ndash; usually when the title/subtitle is quite long and there are five authors&hellip;</p>
<p>Many of the authors of such articles seem have the (today&rsquo;s) stature of Paul Samuelson; both good and famous. On both accounts, you don&rsquo;t say anything but yes, sir&hellip;</p>
<p>Or:
I set one legal journal that called a footnote is the first line of the article. I say footnote, as that&rsquo;s what was used, not end-of-article notes. That footnote went on for three typeset pages. The next note was called in the third line of the text.</p>
<p>So, after we all put our heads together, we set the article opening, two lines of text, then the called footnote for the next three pages, and only then the third line of the text (which called footnote 2) etc. In short, standard, but worrisome for all of that.</p>
<p>Now the first point of all this is that the design of a journal better be simple, in order to be flexible.</p>
<p>The second point is there are articles where all these elements do turn out to be important; where the text is the better for their use. Of course not all of the articles, but enough to provide for their accommodation.</p>
<p>So, journals <em>design</em> is the hardest thing there is, because you cannot see, or even anticipate, all the elements to attend to.</p>
<p>The same, I would think, for student work, from doctoral dissertations on down. Good research &amp; good writing are just that. You can penalize the overly flamboyant when that&rsquo;s all it is, but you shouldn&rsquo;t prohibit anything. One of the hard parts about being a teacher is recognizing the difference, especially with students doing upper level or graduate work. Yes, I&rsquo;ve been there, I wasn&rsquo;t that good at it, and is one reason I didn&rsquo;t like teaching.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My main point above was that the traditions and standards of manuscripts are different from those of published papers — but as long as a student understands the basic expectations of format, there&rsquo;s no reason they shouldn&rsquo;t adjust as necessary for their specific paper.</p>
<p>As a college student, I&rsquo;ve recently written a paper in English that contained both Hebrew and IPA. I&rsquo;ve written other papers that quoted Anglo-Saxon and included metrical stress notations and specialized poetry layouts for the sake of making a linguistic point. Sometimes I had to use something other than Times or some indent other than half an inch. But even as a fairly experienced typographer, I resist &ldquo;designing&rdquo; my academic papers more than is really necessary to make my argument. If I were designing them as part of a journal, they would look much different and more polished than they do for class.</p>

</blockquote>
I don't know what the practice is  in the humanities and social sciences; personally, I have not submitted a "printout" in a long time. What I have been submitting in the last 10 years (and more) is LaTeX sources, relying on the LaTeX package suggested (required?) by the journal or the conference. Some publishers have their own package, for instance <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/author-schemas/preparing-documents-with-latex">Elsevier</a>; have a look at some templates for <a href="http://www.latextemplates.com/cat/academic-journals">academic journals</a>; on the example provided for elsarticle (Elsevier), lines are individually numbered; it would be crazy to do that manually. In my opinion, it is almost as crazy to spend time formatting footnotes for references and bibliography entries instead of using the software that does it in a systematic and coherent fashion. Students should be given the tools to work intelligently and efficiently.</div>

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Of the journals we set, all are in either the humanities or social sciences. I don&rsquo;t believe they would accept a &ldquo;manuscript&rdquo; in LaTex, as the editors would not be able to work on the files.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done some bookwork for presses who get in LaTex files  from time to time. There are people who can convert these to the format acceptable to the press, so we decline to set these &ndash; Strictly based on economics, it would cost more for us to do the conversion than for someone set up to do that routinely.</p>
<p>But the point I was trying to make is that the look of any paper/thesis/dissertation &ndash; double-spaced with such &amp; such margins, had less to do with typography than with the mechanics of preparing a manuscript for eventual composition. As pencil editing is no longer the preferred method of editing,  what &ldquo;manuscripts&rdquo; should look like (and their for-practice precursors &ndash; papers, theses, dissertations) , is a bit up in the air.</p>

<p>I agree that the way a printout looks like can be quite irrelevant. Just changing a package in the preamble of a LaTeX  file can change completely the look without affecting at all the content of the output, just changing a word can replace a single column output by a two column output.</p>
<p>However, for a final undergraduate essay, no professional editor will ever take it as a &ldquo;manuscript&rdquo;; what the student sees is all he&rsquo;ll ever get.</p>

<p>Which gets back to the original question: What are these documents for? Practice for becoming an eventual professional in the field? Even if it will not become ones profession?</p>
<p>Or, coming as close as one can to a final presentation, given that several text editors are essentially layout engines, and fonts common. Yet design is itself another profession&hellip;</p>

<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s a final undergraduate essay or any equivalent term.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not a design course. (If someone hasn&rsquo;t realized that yet&hellip;)</p>
<p>Finally, I don&rsquo;t see why editors wouldn&rsquo;t be able to &ldquo;work on&rdquo; Latex files, but that&rsquo;s another issue. As far as I know, and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Latex does a pretty decent job typesetting for people who are not themselves professional typesetters.</p>
<p>Reviewers/readers can comment between double-spaced lines or along the margins (if they&rsquo;re wide enough), or using Adobe Reader, or on the document itself &ndash; no matter the format. Or on a piece of paper. It&rsquo;s really irrelevant.</p>

On the other hand LyX follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM">What  You See Is What You Mean</a> paradigm, so that (so far as I understand for basic use) the student would not have to deal himself with markup elements, he would simply deal with the content and the professor in charge can adjust the LaTeX packages if needed. I must however say that I have never used LyX, not even on the .lyx files provided by the student; I just compiled the  corresponding .tex files with pdflatex.</div>
