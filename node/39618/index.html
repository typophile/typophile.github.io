  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Now I know this question will either be ignored, taken down or the answer might refer back to either Joshua Darden or some thread about the guy who made the font named "Soul" or even the thread about Intertypographics in the 70's....but I'm still going to ask since the question begs to be asked again and again by the folks I work with, deal with and moreover tell I'm designing type....

The Question:

Where are the African American Type designers? 

Why do I ask? I ask because I am one...Ghanaian-American to be exact and I was wondering if there were any other African / African-American type designers out here...or is just me and Joshua...if so that is indeed sad...

		<div class="commentbody">I don’t think anyone has ever done any serious analysis of type designers ethnic backgrounds (maybe a project for Tom Phinney :-)). Anecdotally you can only draw from the people you know personally or meet at conferences, and although at ATypI and TypeCon the diversity of backgrounds is quite amazing the type designer stereotype is certainly reinforced – there are plenty of nerdy white guys wearing black polo-necks, round rimmed glasses, clutching iPhones, etc., etc., but there are also people in attendance from all over the world. </div>

I think that's an interesting question to ask the 'commercial art' world at large.

There have been several threads on Typophile with a similar question: where are the female type designers? It's good for us to find out the answers to these questions, and to encourage people from margins and hidden communities to achieve and to share, and I think that's happening all over the world now. I don't think there is any cause, fault, or cultural constraint at work. I can certainly see the skewed racial and gender distribution among type designers, but the type world is so very small, and populated by autodidacts and lifelong enthusiasts, I don't see a substantial connection between race, gender, or any other factor, and type design. I don't think type designers are really that similar, once you investigate their motivations, approach and methods. Type designers come from such different backgrounds, it's hard to see real stereotypes (Simon's comical exaggeration notwithstanding). I think Darrel is right that the larger graphic Design world is a place to inquire about these issues. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I love the the Kennedy Printing site. The description of their process is perfect:

"Printing is what we do. You send the text and a check, and go home and pray. We do not know what will happen until we are at the press. The design of your poster is determined in real time. Sometimes we produce beautiful posters and at other times we produce BEAUTIFUL posters."

I love that!</div>
