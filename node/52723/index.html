		<div class="commentbody">Hi Frode,

I got a 17" Macbook Pro for my birthday this past Summer, and I have never been happier. The portability is great to have, allowing me to meet with clients at Starbucks or B&N (since we have an AT&T Internet account at home, the Internet access is free). I have a spare 24" WideScreen I use as as extra monitor too. Once I moved from a single to double monitors at my last job, I have a difficult time going back to a single screen.

If you need the portability, the choice is obvious. If not and you will always be working from the same office, I might go with the iMac (and still use the second monitor ... heeheh).

Good luck.

		<div class="commentbody">If absolute performance isn't a factor then go for the laptop: portability's a huge boon. 

Depending on how good your current monitor is, if your budget'll stretch to a large high-quality external display to go with the laptop then do that, too (and a nice aluminium Apple keyboard while you're at it). I went for a 27" Dell 2709W wide-gamut monitor, as I work with photographs frequently and it fit my price-performance criteria, but if colour accuracy's critical then consider an S-IPS panel or similar (which will be considerably more expensive).

Given a choice, I'd prefer a MacBook + monitor combo to just a MacBook Pro, due to the huge screen 'real estate' when the MB's hooked up, but I'll concede that the non-aluminium MacBook's display panel is downright awful – hopefully the al MacBook's a bit better in this respect. So if you're planning on using it as a straight laptop for most of the time, it may be worth spending the extra on the Pro.

Edit: Oh, forgot to add, buy as much memory for it as possible from Crucial, OCZ or similar (it's too expensive from Apple). You'll need to get a 'Santa Rosa' MacBook (2.2GHz) to take advantage of 4GB as the older MacBooks only recognise 3GB of it, so watch out for that. This'll make a big difference if you work with the Adobe apps frequently, they'll take as much memory as they can get!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a 2.0 Macbook, and i would advise it over an iMac. The performance is great and portability is a plus; One thing though is the 13 inch screen (even the 17 inch pro seems a bit limited) ... When things heat up i prefer to hook it up to a larger monitor or an HD Display because of the very limited screen real estate (it gets pretty hectic when using multiple apps like illustrator and photoshop along with indesign for example).

Apple makes a $20 mini-DVI to whatever connector for the Macbook (it's the only v-out port on the Macbook), i got three variations of that connector for my work, movie time, and audio, and they work great.

Oh, and one more thing - keep your beer and snacks away from the laptop ;)</div>

"Macbooks are good. Macbook Pros are better."

I'd say they are beefier, not necessarily better, given that 'better' is relatively subjective as to what you plan on doing with it.

I think most folks are fine with MacBooks and would end up overspending on a MacBook Pro for features that they likely wouldn't fully leverage.</div>

I'm interested to hear this. I've got a matte MBP now, and the things that scare me about the new models are the keyboard and the screen. So, you don't pick up reflections of things behind you? What's your opinion of the keyboard?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, you get used to the glossy screen in no time. I never notice reflections that much. And in bad lighting conditions also don't affect the glossy screen as much. Or when there is a light behind you reflecting in the screen; with the glossy it's just that but for the rest the screen stays normal, with the matte screens the light reflection becomes a large bloom-like effect, making your screen pretty much unusable.

Plus; the colors and contrast are / look much more vibrant with the glossy screens.

On the keyboard.... not noticably different, they are basically just the same, only the way the case sits around them is different.</div>

I think if you already have a large monitor you might as well get the laptop for the versatility, but go with the 17" if you can swing it.
