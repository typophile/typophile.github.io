    and possibly some example settings of how it is intended to be used. It''s got

  body: "The typeface in all of it's bodies seems very exiting from what the jpg.\r\n\r\nThe
    swashes however are very similar to a Wall Decor product from \"Veer\"\r\n\r\n[[http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0005040]]\r\n\r\nI
    really like the geometric / natural curve look. "
