  body: "ok... maybe no... while Barrio 30 is basically corret, it seems that it's
    'over sprayed' especially in the G and T... is it a knock off? or is there a pro
    version somewhere? I tried looking at the stereo type website but had no luck
    there...\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: I thought that too, at first, but on closer inspection in seems to be far
    to consistant... i'm trying to track down a pdf of the booklet it's from, when
    you see it used in other headings it becomes clear it's just type... well that's
    what i think anyway...

    me here: http://www.sxc.hu/photo/458192 so it was not a font, but barrio 30 is
    the font made from that pic.\r\n\r\ncheers"
