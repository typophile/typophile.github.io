  must be ofcourse, quite readable by the human eye ofcourse\r\n\r\nwhat do you suggest?\r\n\r\nany
  specific font?\r\nwhich size of font?\r\n\r\nwhich paper type?\r\nwhich printer
  settings?\r\n\r\nany specific method of writing the text?\r\nfor example:\r\nreplacing
  spaces with fullstops\r\nremoving spaces at all and capitalizing the first letter
  of each word\r\nremoving letters or word parts, but still the text be comprehensible?\r\nany
  specific way to compress text? any algorith, cryptographic method etc?\r\n\r\nany

  body: "It really depends on how much and the type of copy you are trying to fit,
    however, I would recommend that you don't try any of the substitution methods,
    keep it as much like as any other copy you want to be read, you can reduce the
    word spaces slightly, but anything else will reduce the usability. Try keeping
    it left aligned with the right ragged with as few hyphens as possible, if there
    is a lot (a page for example) use columns rather than a long measure. When you
    mention printer settings are you trying to print this using a laser printer? I
    have achieved fairly satisfactory results with both these faces at 5.5 on 6.5pts,
    but bear your audience in mind.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/condensed-no-18/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bell-centennial/\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Since 2 out of 5 English letters are vowels, I recommend \u2014 after choosing
    the smallest font possible\u2014 modifying the a,e,i,o,u to sit on the top or
    go under the preceding letters. You will get something similar to Arabic Script.
    Worth Trying?!\r\n"

  body: Ascenders and descenders create a lot of empty space. Use all caps, or a unicase
    font, and you can subtract leading to get more lines in.
