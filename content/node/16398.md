  me figure out just exactly what this was set in, and so eventually i forgot all
  about it... Now i've just come across it again and i just have to know what it is...
  Can anyone pin it down? I'm hoping this one is going to be really easy for one of
  you :)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vo_ct_bbk2.jpg]"

    as Caslon T has. I continue my search.

    well be version i didn't check out -i'm guessing this sample is from the early
    nineties which would seem to rule out the recent revised caslon co ones...\r\n\r\nThe
    is S is the character that got me, whenever i was close that S would just be there
    all squat sitting up there at the end, it just didn't match up -maybe an artifact
    as a result of being reversed out..?\r\n\r\n "

  body: Not sure, check the slanted serifs on the cap T of the Dutch766. My guess
    is that you won't find an exact match in digital type. Did Vaughan Oliver work
    with a computer in those days?

  body: The T is the only character that differs from the samples of Imprint that
    I've found, but I think this is simply a matter of which size of the metal version
    was used as the basis of whatever version this is. The differences are also very
    small. (Ironically, Monotype's is the most different of all.) If you have a copy
    of Jaspert's Ecyclopaedia of Type Faces, check out the sample on page 120.

    site was real busy yesterday each time i tried to access, so couldn't thank you
    earlier... i think i can finally rest on this one now. So thank you all.\r\n\r\nI
    think Hannes is right, Vaughn i think, did resist the introduction of computers,
    and that would probably explain the funky t... I guess what your saying was that
    it was blown up from a smaller sample than the rest of the type...\r\n\r\nWould
    Jaspert's book be a good investment for a budding typophile? - I have been waiting
    for the new fontbook to come out, if it ever will... Is there one referance book
    to rule them all so to speak? \r\n\r\nMany thanks again... "

  body: Jaspert (as we aficionados like to call it) is an excellent book for seeing
    samples of American and European metal faces. The main drawback to me is that
    some of the samples are only a few words. Still, there are faces in there I've
    never seen anywhere else.
