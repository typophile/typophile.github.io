One could say that it's odd that Apple is so well loved as a maverick, while Microsoft, with Bill Gates being so generous, is so roundly hated.

People will gravitate to the operating system for which the most applications are available. But then they feel upset when one operating system becomes so dominant that they don't have a choice.

Basically, what they probably want, even if they haven't articulated it, is for the government to impose a standard API for all operating systems, and instruction set for all computers, so that choosing between Windows or OS X or OS/2 or BeOS or Linux just means choosing performance features... but all program binaries run on all computers, just like you can visit any web site with Firefox <em>or</em> Internet Explorer.

That way, you choose the best operating system on performance and features (which one comes with better solitare games?) and you don't have to look over your shoulder trying to figure out if the application you need will be available for that operating system, or whether your peripherals will have drivers for that operating system.

All programs, including all device drivers, just work on every operating system, because they conform to the API standard.

American consumers just feel entitled to having a marketplace where all products are sold as commodity products at commodity prices. So instead of buying an operating system for $150 from Microsoft, they expect to be able to buy one for, say, $30 from SoftKey (remember them?) with no problem, because nasty old Microsoft isn't allowed to lock up its API to prevent competing operating systems from running all the same software as its operating system can.</div>
