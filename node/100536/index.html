Nobody is <em>jerking him around</em>! I told Raul exactly why I was not recommending the one I found. If that’s not a legitimate reason for not recommending this maker’s products I’d like to know what is. 
<p>And this way he can make an informed choice about whether he’d like to buy something from such a maker, and maybe he has higher standards than you seem to have. If the subject didn’t come up, if someone just linked to the font and none of us said anything, well that’s just tacit support. We should hold to higher standards than that.</div>

When I was working with my &ldquo;Geometry Soft&rdquo; project I toyed with making a connected version, I remembered that logo, and I chose to implement some similar letterforms across my two Script versions. It is not identical - it is after all built directly on my original Geometry Soft Pro letterforms). I made a sample image containing the word &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; as a homage ;)</p>
<p>@Gräfenberg: I object strongly to your language and description of my efforts over 5 years. I would recommend investigating matters before you throw your accusations around. 
CheapProFonts is mainly a collection of upgraded &ldquo;free&rdquo; fonts, and all fonts reworked by me are done under agreement with the original font designers. They receive up to 50% of the retail price of all my Pro versions sold (which means that the fonts I sell through distributors like MyFonts, Fontspring and Fontdeck leave precious little for myself ;) If you ask any of my 13 collaborators I am sure they can vouch for me.
I have also created many new font designs of my own. Some of them may not be extremely original, but they are in no way ripoffs.
CheapProFonts is a good karma project (good quality, low price, fair royalties, generous licensing terms) and I am sad to see you slander me and my foundry  like this&hellip;</p>

<p>Roger, since you seem to be an honorable type designer you probably appreciate that there&rsquo;s a lot of gray out there in terms of legitimacy. I definitely think you should protect yourself, but also do value Good Intentions (which can nonetheless cause trouble sometimes) since that&rsquo;s the only thing that keeps us honorable.</p>

<p>Rather full of…ourselves, are we, Raul? Sorry if piracy is no concern of yours; OTOH, we who make our livings from designing and/or producing fonts actually DO give a rat’s patoot about it. Furthermore, the Type ID Board is the MOST LIKELY place to promulgate the no-piracy message, given the large number of noobs who come here seeking counsel and advice.</p>

<p>By all means give specifics. I&rsquo;d love to know. I have tried only connecting myself to reputable font creators, so I feel confident that all the outlines of their fonts are original.
BTW, I do know Bleeding Cowboys is a roughed up version of Oklahoma, and that Fontleroy is based on Stuyvesant and Bellevue&hellip; And some of the other &ldquo;grunge&rdquo; fonts are probably also based on other fonts&hellip; But I feel that they all add something new to the designs, and do not compete with the originals in any way.</p>

<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m not making an accusation of any kind - I haven&rsquo;t even looked very closely at your library. And I certainly think your acceptance of feedback from Ernst is a very good sign.</p>
<p>For example my Trajic notRoman* was made with the outlines of Adobe Trajan. There&rsquo;s no way it could ever be used instead of Trajan (and in fact it might even help Trajan&rsquo;s sales since it intermixes with it). However not only did I not release it, but whenever somebody emails me asking to <em>purchase</em> it, I say no.</p>

</blockquote>
Absolutely. And I feel confident no outlines have been reused in the grunge fonts I have reworked. I base this on the horrible quality of the outlines, spacing and character sets of the fonts I started out with... ;) They were probably created with printouts or samples printed out, then grunged up, scanned and outlined. Which I think is a fair working method.
<p>And f.ex. Nick Curtis and Halmos Levente are excellent at drawing outlines with beziers, so all their fonts are drawn from scratch, for sure.</p>
<p>Myself, I also drew my own (rather geometric) version of DIN Mittelschrift (from the german specs) before creating all my experimental variants of it in my (still ongoing) DINfun project.</p>
<p>I have made every effort to keep CheapProFonts an honest and fair foundry (even fighting some REAL pirates in the background) and have a very clear conscience about my work.</p>

<blockquote>BTW, I do know Bleeding Cowboys is a roughed up version of Oklahoma, and that Fontleroy is based on Stuyvesant and Bellevue... And some of the other "grunge" fonts are probably also based on other fonts...

Those are of course what I was referring to. 
<p>The issue for me is when you can plainly identify that a commercial font was used as the basis for a grunge/distressed font. When the base lettershapes are created by redrawing  — no matter how badly :-) — it is obviously less egregious than actual outline theft, but that does not make it any more ethical in my book (no matter that it is legal in some markets). AFAIC it directly sponges off the designer of the original font because, let’s be frank here, the finished product wouldn’t exist without that original.</p>
<p>Furthermore when a font such as this is done by an amateur enthusiast and intended to be released for free that’s one thing, but when subsequently given a commercial release that’s something else entirely.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all: I do know a lot of font history, and I do care very much about type designers and their rights. I just see it slightly different than you regarding some of these cases - I take more into consideration if the fonts add something new, and if they compete in any way with their &ldquo;originals&rdquo;. If they respectively do and don&rsquo;t (and are drawn from scratch) I think they&rsquo;re OK - and deserve a reworking and a commercial release.
And there ARE fonts that I have available for reworking that I will NOT rework and release, exactly because of such considerations&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe you have &ldquo;higher standards&rdquo; - you just have &ldquo;different standards&rdquo;. So I felt your initial response &ldquo;I’m certain the maker is guilty of ripping off legitimate commercial fonts&rdquo; was really uncalled for.</p>
<p>BTW, Oklahoma started out as a free font, which was probably why Guillaume used it as a basis for what became Bleeding Cowboys. Both fonts now have commercial versions. It&rsquo;s progress. ;)</p>
