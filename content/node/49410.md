  Hegglid. The idea was made in 2007 as something we missed in our town. A breeding
  place for type-fanatics. We are now a group of people with relations to the design/advertising
  industry in Trondheim, Norway. \r\n\r\nWe all have passion and love for typography,
  and want to share our ideas, inspirations and knowledge with everyone. Kern or die!\r\n\r\nwww.hellotypo.com"
