  on a fantastic t-shirt which is, what I believe, a merchandise item by The Mae-Shi,
  the experimental rock band. T-shirts most likely originated from their website but
  are no longer available, so the only chance of owning one of those is recreating
  it myself.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Imgladfont_4717.jpg]"
