body: "I am working on a logo(type), I'm using Futura Medium for this, all lower case.\r\n\r\nThe
  name has a 'u' and an 'n', so during sketching I tried to rotate the 'u' 180 degrees
  and use that as an 'n', less clutter because the 'n' has this slightly 'ascending'
  stem on the left while the 'u' is like an upper case 'U'.\r\n\r\nNow this looks
  good imo, only thing... since there's also an 'a' in the name, the 'a' would be
  the only character left with a slightly 'descending' and 'ascending' stem (right).\r\n\r\nIs
  this weird? being inconsistant?\r\n\r\nI mean the original font seems to be inconsistent
  too because the 'u' looks like an upper case 'U' still I'm not sure if I can leave
  the 'a' as is.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm clear lol, can't post the logotype.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    like an 'o' with the type I use... Futura Medium Condensed... I left that out
    in the original post sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you want the \"a\" (like John's) to be less like an \"o\" you give it
    a hard top-right. Or you could make the \"a\" from a \"u\" rotated 90 degrees
    clockwise, then close the right side with a stem.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n- An \"n\" made
    from a flipped \"u\" will appear slightly narrower than the \"u\" (optical illusion)
    so you probably want to compensate for that.\r\n- Make sure you don't end up too

    What are the other letters in the name? Is there an \"e\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
