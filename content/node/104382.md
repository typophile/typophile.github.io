  (i.e., the font in which \"GAME OF CAGES\" has been written? It is used on the cover
  for the first couple of novels in the Twenty Palaces series by Harry Connolly. \r\n\r\nNeither
  WhatTheFont nor Identifont yielded any results, so I am hoping that someone here
  has seen this font before or can help me identify it. \r\n\r\nThanks either way!\r\n\r\n-
