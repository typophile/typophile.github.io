  it. I drew a font in Illustrator, and imported each letter as an eps into FontLab,
  and exported as OpenType. The exported font looks pretty good for the most part,
  but some of the letter widths appear subtly, but unmistakably, different, and I'm
  certain that they are all the same in Illustrator. Should I build the font larger,
  or what? Any ideas on how to solve this problem? \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nAsh"

  body: "Sounds like rounding errors to me. FontLab is based on a unit system that
    matches typefaces used in production. AI is not limited by such standards  so
    it is cast on a much finer unit system. The problem comes in the conversion from
    AI to FontLab. The number of units get rounded down to 1000 causing minor glitches.
    This is one of the reasons it is not a good idea to begin with AI and convert
    to FontLab when designing type. Since you already have fairly finished AI drawings,
    you may not have much of a choice. Know that you must correct all of your drawings
    after conversion though! AI also does some funny things with points that need
    correction in type design use. It is truly better to begin your typeface directly
    in FontLab for best results and faster work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    learn after a while that for type design, the tools are actually far superior.
    I started using AI in 1987 and love it as well but for type, it is not the best.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "As someone who has used both extensively for drawing fonts, FontLab's tools
    are not inferior, just different and, in your case, unfamiliar. For drawing glyphs,
    once I got accustomed to them, I found that FontLab's tools are better suited
    to drawing glyphs. \r\n\r\nAbout the only thing I don't like is the way the scaling
    tool works. I still prefer the way that works in Illustrator. In FontLab, all
    the transformation tools work like this: Click to set an anchor/pivot point, drag
    to the desired scale/rotation angle/skew angle, release the mouse button to finish.
    In Illustrator it works like this: Click and release to set an anchor/pivot point,
    click and drag to the desired scale/rotation angle/skew angle, release the mouse
    button to finish. The difference is subtle, but in the case of scaling, you can
    be much more precise in Illustrator, all because of that second click, especially
    when scaling by a small amount. In FontLab, I often have to resort to using the
    transformation palette because of the imprecision of the scaling tool."

  body: "Ash,\r\n\r\nIf you scale your Illustrator drawing to the proper size you
    will have a good chance at reducing most of the rounding error.\r\n\r\n1 pt in
    Illustrator corresponds to 1 unit in FontLab, So if you want to make your caps
    700 units high in FL, scale them up to 700 pts high in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nBut
    I would recommend buying ScanFont from FontLab. It gives you a great deal of control
    over importing eps outlines into FontLab, and rather than cut and paste into separate
    cells, ScanFont will do that whole process in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nThe
    price of ScanFont pays for itself first time you use it.\r\n\r\nJamesM"
