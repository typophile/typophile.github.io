    Tracker</a> to be very useful. I don't know why no one has responded. I'm a Mac
    user, but a quick search there gave returned <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/php/search.php?PHPSESSID=981ba9cfcba12bf1e7ad90d39aa25e05&mode=basic&action=search&str=font+management&plt%5B%5D=windows&x=0&y=0">these</a>

  body: "I tried some of the other Windows font management programs but they just
    messed things up for me. I think these are basically a Mac thing. ATM delux apparently
    is not a good idea to install on a PC currently. Windows 2000 handles PS fonts
    by itself, and if you instally ATM delux you can't uninstall it without messing
    up the operating system. I just reverted to activating/deactivating fonts by moving
    them in or out of the windows/fonts folder, using the control panel/fonts window.
