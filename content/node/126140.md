body: "Looking for this font, used in the chapter headings of L. Jagi Lamplighter\u2019s
  Rachel Griffin books. In the title pages, this seems to have been tweaked, but it\u2019s
  definitely a font not hand-lettering. WhatTheFont and Identifont have not helped."

    suggested Ray Meadows\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ray-meadows/rm-victoriana/\">RM
    Victoriana</a>. This is very close, except for a few details (top serifs on the
    T, cross-bar of the A, tail on the N)\u2014I\u2019m guessing this was a slightly
    tweaked variant of that font.\r\n"

    Ginger</a>, which he later polished and turned into RM Victoriana."
