  body: "Hi Jimmy. I had to read a lot of text before I found your menu, and when
    I tried to find your work I spent another minute figuring out the gallery navigation
    and the logic behind the sorting. I clicked the full screen button a couple of
    times as well trying to find my way. Additionally the mute button didn't react
    at first. By then, 95% of your readers would have left.\r\nAnd that's only the
    navigation. "

  body: "Wow, I thought I'd only scare 65% visitors. :D\r\n\r\nWhat do you think if
    I only left the first introductory paragraph at the frontpage and left visitors'
    mouse wander around for the menu?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your opinion."

  body: I think you need a navigation visitors don't have to search for. It should
    be obvious the second they enter the site. If you're sticking with the flash approach,
    look to the masters at <a href="http://www.group94.com/">group94</a> for inspiration.

  body: "Well, I guess I have to go back to Wordpress again and let the visitors choose
    a version they prefer. :D\r\n\r\nBut thanks again for your opinion Frank. I like
    your simple site."
