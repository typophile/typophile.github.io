    I believe [[Letterror]] has something like this, don't they?

    body: "thanks for trying - Federal was the closest, though not close enough i
      could find.\r\n\r\nthis for Patroon was designed by Lousie Fili - i have one
      book compiled by her  - \"Design Connoisseur\" - but no sign of it there\r\n\r\ni
      wonder if it may be in one of her others: Typology: Type Design from the Victorian
      Era to the Digital Age...\r\n\r\ni have also seen it used elsewhere in the UK
      so it shouldn't be this hard to find!\r\n\r\nthanks again"

  body: timd is correct, I've been to Louise's office in Manhattan and spoke with
    her about the type she uses. Most if not all her identities are custom/hand drawn
    in her office by herself or one of her designers.

  body: "thanks for all the help and comments. the incredibly helpful member typographica
    at newstoday pointed me towards that archivetype.com site when i was sniffing
    around a few months ago for this font! and rather nice it is too.\r\n\r\ni knew
    that this was not hand drawn or customised as i'd seen bits of it elsewhere. and
    lo and behold...its in a dover book - but not in any in the dover store on earlham
    st.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roman.jpg] \r\n\r\nthanks to Miss Tiffany
    i finally went to the st brides library. shameful as i've lived 5 minutes from
    the place - so extra thanks miss T, i shall be spending quite a lot of time there
    in the future.\r\n\r\nbest wishes"

  body: Hmm this must be one of the few that's not custom. Good correction. I was
    assuming and you all know what that ends up doing...
