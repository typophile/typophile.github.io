		<div class="commentbody">it looks good small. <BR> <BR>the &#34;ar&#34; pair seems tight compared to the others although of course if you increase kerning there you might need to do the same elsewhere. it&#39;s just the neg space between the &#34;r&#34; and the last &#34;t&#34; that is bothering me: too big compared to the others. <BR> <BR>the symbol is not doing much for me as it is, the logotype is the star here. i&#39;m not sure what to suggest tho. <BR> <BR>last thing: i like the period. gives it character and this sense that this is part of a larger story.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you should reconsider the name if the &#39;inside joke&#39; isn&#39;t absolutely fantastic. Or ... if we should comment on it here ... we ought to know about the joke. <BR> <BR>What I see is a pretty good logotype &#40;together with the period, which I like too ... like the case of the british EAT. the period adds uniqueness to the mark&#41; ... and the symbol is a tart of which someone has taken a bite. I think the tart/bite illustration isn&#39;t executed very well ... should look more natural. <BR> <BR>I agree that &#39;ar&#39; is too tight. <BR> <BR>But first of all ... give us the story behind tart. As it is now, I can&#39;t make any meaning of it. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>S</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like it. And I like it that you&#39;re not roping yourself into a single color combo. <BR> <BR>One nice thing about the word &#34;tart&#34; is that it carries at least three connotations &#40;in English&#41; that I&#39;m aware of -- the sour flavor, a pastry, and a hooker. That gives you a lot of edginess. Good stuff!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the name, but not the typeface. This begs for something a bit more fun and a bit more display-oriented, rather than typesetting-oriented. A bit more geometric and a bit less industrial gothic. The design seems aimed towards the fun and friendly, but the type is pulling it in another direction. <BR> <BR>Personally, I don&#39;t think the mark is such a big deal, but it definitely doesn&#39;t say &#39;this is a tart&#39; to me at all, but if you both agree that this is a visual element that captures the essence of your studio, then convention be damned. If you&#39;d like it to be more accessible, perhaps you should do something with crust and filling. Right now it looks like a bite, but the bite and the tart edge read as the same thing, which confuses both. Here&#39;s a photograph of a <a href="http://www.proppersource.com/images/foods/tart-rasp.jpg">stage prop tart</a>, which could be a good model for judging proportions of various details, since stage props are designed to read from a distance. <BR> <BR>That said, it&#39;s a good sTart. &#40;I couldn&#39;t help myself.&#41; You&#39;ve got an intriguing concept to work with.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How about if only the &#34;T&#34; in tart were reversed out of the cloud shape and the &#34;art&#34; would stay black?  This would make a double meaning with the word ART so that it would read &#34;T&#34; &#34;ART&#34; as well as TART.  The &#34;T&#34; could mean typographic, TEAMED &#40;since there are 2 of you&#41;, or suit you to a &#34;T&#34;.  The ART would refer to your business function, an art/design studio. <BR>It would still be fun and playful but at least give the viewer a hint as to what you do.  As it stands now, it could mean anything from a florist toi a baker. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>
