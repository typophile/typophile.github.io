  body: '&#39;Larissa&#39; is one of many names for a font whose correct name &#40;I
    think&#41; is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=Ballantines" target="_blank">&#39;Ballantines&#39;</a>.
    Other names are <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/biorst.htm" target="_blank">Biorst</a>,
    Dianna, Cotillion, Balladeer, Progena &amp; Premi. I have linked to two of them,
    as Biorst is only $2. You might use Fontseek to look for some of the other names
    if you are willing to take your chances that you will find an uncorrupted copy
    on a &#39;freeware&#39; site.  Considering that what you are looking for comes
    from a non-digital piece of sculpted type, I think this is a fair approximation
    for the style you want to match.'
