body: "OK... I  have so far got away with using Helvetica that shipped with Mac OSX,
  and a couple of weights from Adobe I purchased yonks ago just for particular jobs.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I now need a Sans with good readability, and <strong>with condensed and expanded
  options</strong> within the family. It must also be excellent for providing prices
  in catalogues (some fonts just don't kern very well with decimal places) in the
  UK, so a nice straightforward Pound sign is essential. I own a good part of Dax,
  but the kerning for decimals (e.g. \xA33.45) is distracting IMHO.\r\n\r\nI have
  looked at Proxima Nova, Humanist 777, Swiss 721, Akzidenz Grot (nice but not sure
  about the Pound sign), but I keep coming back to the dreaded Helvetica... but I
  don't want to spend that kind of money, when Nimbus offers all I need for less...\r\n\r\nSo,
  is there any good reason to avoid Nimbus over Adobe Helvetica (I don't see one),
  or are there any other real alternatives?\r\n\r\n"

    Helvetica]] from Linotype, instead of Adobe Helvetica... :)

    not sure if I understand what you mean by that ... I would expect that for price
    listings, tabular figures would be required, in which no kerning is involved (or
    the numbers would not align). Or are your prices not in tabular form?\r\n\r\nThe
    default figures of Helvetica are tabular, but Helvetica's figures are not easy
    to tell apart in small sizes \u2013 which makes them less than ideal for price
    settings.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvetica-dax_4304.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Top:
