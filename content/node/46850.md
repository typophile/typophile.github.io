  someone named Charles Andermack. Unless he got pranked (Chanked?), then I must say
  \"bravo!\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/technology/personaltech/26basics.html?em&ex=1214712000&en=a2063db595baad4a&ei=5087%0A\r\n"

    a new, married name, Charles Andermack.\r\n\r\nSi is right, it's a hybrid, my
    wife and I smashed our names together,\r\nbecause we didn't want to deal with
    hyphenated names.\r\nSo we just made up a new legal family name.\r\n\r\nEverybody
    still calls me \"Chank\".\r\n\r\nThat's who you should make the check payable
    to. \r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\nChank

    I was thinking that a) I either feel dumb and thought Chank's real name was something
    else for the past 10 years, or b) the NYT actually screwed up. \r\n"
