    suggested London. It is just a matter of finding an appropriate partner school
    or organization with space to host it."

  body: "Interesting that Singapore* would do better than NYC. Maybe anybody into
    type in the latter already has his/her nose to the grindstone... :-) You should
    do one in Beirut too - I can hook you up with Khajag Apelian.\r\n\r\n* BTW I mentioned
    the workshop to my friend Karen Huang, and she signed up!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    But several people asked us, so there we went.\r\n"
