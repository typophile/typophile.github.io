  not sure what sociological mindset there is today, besides the political\u2014a
  love for the current president of the Unites States, and something of a Robin Hood
  idea of the Occupy movement. At least that's what's going on in America, I don't
  know so much about the rest of the world. How does one express that, or react to
  it, with type? Those notions and movements are not really new at all, just in their
  place and specific circumstances. And certainly nationality is not a new piece of
  vocabulary for type.\r\n\r\nThinking about it, there is a definite movement towards
  natural & organic, sustainability, and equal rights (marriage) for same sex and
  other challenging views on marriage, or non-marriage or whatever the case may be.
  These are to an extent expressed in recent typefaces, whether consciously or not,
  such as the many organic types, or the pairing of a sans with a sans (Sense & Sensibility).\r\n\r\nShould
  political and social movements influence type? And to what extent?\r\n\r\n(this
  is stemming from <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/91021#comment-499892\">this
  thread</a>)"

    today's type scene is indeed a problem,\r\nand not at all limited to Google's
    effort.\r\n\r\nI'll find time to reply in full with my thoughts, and bring in\r\nthings
    from the other threads so we can focus on one place.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Perhaps a prelude to your question is in order: to what extent can the design
    of a typeface imply or suggest any attitude?\r\n\r\nCertainly, attitudes like
    silly, creepy, quaint, charming, impetuous and the like are easily enough communicated,
    but what are the essential qualities of any social movement, and how are these
    qualities conveyed? What is an economically just letterform? Can a serif be unbiased?
    What does an ampersand for the 99% look like?\r\n\r\nThese are not idle questions;
    I really would like to know..."
