  body: I think there is a version at TypOasis. But if I remember correctly it wasn&#39;t
    pristine. I&#39;ve always loved these.

  body: There&#39;s still plenty of room for improvement, no? It seems, <BR>though,
    that you get into complexity / file size issues, though, <BR>when you try and
    capture every little detail of these fancy caps <BR>in a font, so perhaps doing
    so isn&#39;t realistic. Dunno.

- body: Oookey-<i>dokey</i>, I see... <BR>Very useful link there, I downloaded the
    already fontified version and found it was good <i>enough</i> but not great. Still,
    this means there&#39;s no point in doing a half-assed version, so might as well
    go for gold, including a full clean-up, adding two or three  options for different
    coloured shades. <BR>Could be a good opportunity to learn Fontlab properly.  <BR>Let&#39;s
    call it semi-realistic and I&#39;ll get back to you if there&#39;s anything to
    show. <BR> <BR>Thank you both! <BR> <BR>
