  O. Saxe, \"Turning Lead into Gold: Nineteenth-Century American Type Foundries and
  Their Specimen Books\"\r\n<!--break-->\r\nFrom a shaky beginning in the new American
  republic, the type founding industry grew with westward expansion, economic development,
  and mechanization. In the process it produced some of the most fanciful, exuberant
  types ever seen. This lecture will review the development of type-founding technologies
  and survey the type specimen books the type foundries produced to promote their
  wares. The lecture is free and open to the public.\r\n\r\nEdison and Newman Room,
