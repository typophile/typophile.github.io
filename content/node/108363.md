  body: When you look at the CSS of <a href="http://www.hardgraft.com/pages/terms">the
    source</a> of your sample, you will discover that the font they used is one of
    those that Ryuk mentioned, namely <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/guildford-pro/">Guildford</a>.
    Differences in appearance are likely to be due to the size of the sample and/or
    the font rendering not being the same in every browser.
