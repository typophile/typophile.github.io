Invitation to Submit Work for Rotovision Book - FONT - Classic Typefaces for Contemporary Graphic Design

I am working on a book on classic typefaces used in contemporary graphic design for Rotovision, a noted UK publisher. FONT will feature around 60 classic typefaces and will feature the best in today's design using typographic favorites like Frutiger, Helvetica, Bodoni, Clarendon, and Baskerville. FONT will be published next summer by Rotovision in the UK and Princeton Architectural Press in the United States.

We are seeking a variety of design work that uses the classic typefaces featured in FONT. Work across all media is welcome.

At the end of this message is a list of the fonts that will be featured in FONT. If you have created design work using any of these typefaces, we'd like to see it. You can submit good quality jpegs, PDFs, or other Mac-compatible formats for the initial review. Once we've taken a look at the images you submit, we'll ask for high-resolution files suitable for print, along with more information about each project, and have you fill out and sign a simple release form granting us permission to publish the image(s) in FONT.

We ask that you please only submit work that you already have permission to publish for promotional purposes, or work that you can quickly and easily obtain a client release for.

Multiple submissions are encouraged. All work will be properly credited.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not trying to start a debate or anything, but I'm curious as to how the list of typefaces was chosen? I was kind of surprised to see that of the three Adobe Originals in the set, two of them were Blackoak and Wood Type Ornaments.... Eldorado, Monterey and Vineta were also unexpected (to me).

Also, some typefaces listed are classics that have been revived in often radically different versions, such as Bodoni, Caslon, and Garamond. Are we to assume that the different cuts are interchangeable for purposes of this book? 

Cheers,

		<div class="commentbody">To answer Tom - some of the typefaces listed were from the original publisher's spec. There will be some adjustments, depending on the quality of work we get in for all the listed typefaces. I know some of the choices might seem out of the norm, but they were chosen based on trying to get a well rounded overview of classic types, with a few modern "classics" worked into the mix.

Multiple cuts will be illustrated to show designers how different some variants are that are sold under the same or similar names.</div>
