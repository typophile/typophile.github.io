body: 'PBS just showed a wonderful commentary about &#34;persuasion.&#34; It&#39;s
  design &amp; advertising rather than type, but worth a look if you&#39;re into it.
  Part of it even talked about jetblue and song. Luckily, they have a site where you
  can watch the show online &#40;starting november 12th&#41; or read more about it:

  <BR> <BR>&#40;very nice looking site, too.&#41;'

  body: If you kept the channel tuned to PBS, you&#39;d be glad you had a TV more
    often. Frontline is always excellent. Thanks for the heads up on this episode!
