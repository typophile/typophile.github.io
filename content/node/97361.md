  this label from literally a scrap of paper and I haven't the slightest as to what
  this font is!! The curvature doesn't help as it won't run through what the font
  this way!!! ah! maybe I have been at work too long but I'm thinking this font is
  probably pretty easily identified, too :'( \r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated!
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
