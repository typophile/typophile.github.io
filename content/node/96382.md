    a few years ago? I remember seeing it in Eye (or maybe Print) magazine.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in 3 weights, and Pascal Zughbi designed at least one weight of a companion Arabic.
    However, I am not aware of any magazine article on these two fonts."

  body: "Congratulations, Mamoun.\r\n\r\nThe idea of multiple non-Latin companion
    designs for the same Latin typeface is something that has interested me ever since
    I designed new Greek and Cyrillic companions for Helvetica. It seems to me that
    each companion design harmonises with different aspects of the Latin, and this
    is possible because only within a single script is it possible to harmonise all
    aspects."

    \r\n\r\nThis is an exciting typeface; it attracts professional's eye to titles
    and keywords of knowledge and I would like to take the occasion to thank you for
    this excellent artwork.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks John.\r\n\r\nYou are right, different Arabic companions to Latin typefaces
    focus on certain aspects of compatibility and thus may be useful in certain settings
    or for different applications. \r\n\r\nThe same is true about multiple Latin companions
    to Arabic typefaces. I have used Shilia successfully with Univers, Helvetica,
    and in the case of Burj Khalifa with Foundry Sans. "

    when you look at delivering long text things get much narrower and some tight
    ideals can -and need to- be aimed for.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
