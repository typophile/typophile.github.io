body: "I'm old enough that when I hear the word \"gangster,\" I immediately think
  of Al Capone.  However, my young client is thinking in terms of \"Hip-Hop Gangsta'
  Rap.\" When you all stop lauging, can you recommend an interesting logo font for
  a small record company specializing in Gangsta' Rap? (Oh yes, I should mention that
  it's specifically Cholo Gangsta' Rap).... Blackletter fonts that resemble tattoos
  are the most obvious choice, but is there anything else out there that might be
  a more interesting alternative? I'm certain this forum is loaded with gang members,
  so I eagerly await your response!\r\nThanks one and all!\r\nDK~  "

    is the Mexican halmark - especially now. Have you seen the posts on the topic.
    I have seen some wonderful icecream carts... \r\n\r\nA really swoosty blackletter
    might be cool. A blackletter with funk. Think Bass and a tiny bit of trebble..."

    of the logo.  Apparently, we are all witnesses to the death of cuteness. Sigh...\r\nDK~\r\n"

  body: Well, if you already have the pitbull, then it might be the right time to
    go cute, pink and stylish... big slap in the face. Is like you put the pitbull
    in the arms of Cholo's girlfriend, or even worse, in the ones of his mum!.

    Dolly is an Underware font.
