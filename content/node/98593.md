  body: Don't know if there's a way to produce a global list, but if you set fonts
    and sizes via style sheets then you don't need to worry about missing a text box.

    you can see in a <a href=\"http://www.rolanddreger.net/download/Screenshot/appliedFont.mov\">demo
    movie</a>, it can report a variety of text properties. A very well done job."

  body: As for font usage, it doesn't even need a script. "Find Font" in the Type
    menu is a pretty basic tool in my workflow.

  body: "If you use Find and Change you can use the formats menus to find all instances
    of a family and set them all the same size. \r\n\r\nDepending on how you set up
    and apply style sheets you can find that not all the instances will change \u2013\_this
    seems to especially apply to tables \u2013 generally due to an errant character
    style.\r\n\r\nTim"
