  body: "I think you are right Ricardo,\r\n<strong>Mac ttnorm</strong> lowercase looks
    very much like <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/poetica/|Poetica
    Chancery]]</strong> \r\nand they have also created another typeface (Baggage ttstd)
    with the same lowers,\r\nand a bit different/modified capitals.\r\n\r\nThe funny
    thing is ImageLine has a history on accusing/threatening others by e-mails,\r\nfor
    forgeries of their copyrighted work, see there:\r\nhttp://extortionletterinfo.com/imageline.htm\r\n"
