  me to introduce my first release font.\r\n\r\nWallington is a decorative-serif font
  embodying vintage and elegant curves with functional structure. Inspired by Old
  English cultures and their descendants between the mid-5th century and the mid-12th
  Century. Made up of two styles, Wallington Regular that consists of 491 glyphs and
  Wallington Small Caps with 365 glyphs. All glyphs are divided into several OpenType
  features such as Ligature, Contextual Alternates, Old Style Numeric and some astonishing
  special characters that allows you to mix and match pairs of letters to fit your
  design. \r\n\r\nFind out more : http://ink.creativezeune.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4492.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_4962.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6555.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6664.png]"

  body: "It\u2019s a nice typeface, probably perfect for book title designs. It feels
    much more like Art Nouveau, or early 20th century, than 5th and 12th century.
    I could see a title like \u201CLady Chatterly\u2019s Lover\u201D set in this typeface."
