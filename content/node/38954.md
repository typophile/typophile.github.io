  body: The point is that none of these three appears to be a new design so I would
    like to be able to satisfy our designer's request for them from our existing inhouse
    library, without spending hours searching.

  body: The time you will spend trying to find something to replace them with could
    be translated into dollars, right? I mean your time to your boss is worth  money.
    Chances are you aren't going to find good replacements in the libraries you already
    have. (I could be wrong if you happen to have a massive library.) So maybe save
    your boss some money and suggest they license the fonts from House to begin with.

  body: "I have never been able to understand why some here see fit to criticize others
    for balking at House's forced bundling and/or pricing. What is worth the price
    to one may not be to another - regardless of the quality of the product. House
    fonts, too, are surely beyond the means of lots of even professionals.\r\n\r\nIf
    someone does not specifically require specific House fonts, then why in the world
    would they <em>not</em> seek out similar, less expensive alternatives? It just
    seems so judgemental (even snobbish) to me.\r\n\r\nJan, there was no logic at
    all in your question.\r\n\r\nGeorge - First of all, your assumption that the House
    fonts are not original designs is false. As such, any alternatives would only
    be similar, not the same. Also, it rather discourages suggestions from us when
    we couldn't possibly have a clue as to what fonts you have on hand.\r\n\r\nSo
    , with no thought as to what you <em>might</em> have available already, here are
    two suggestions:\r\n\r\nFor House Holiday Gothic, see what you think of Larabie's
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mikadan/\" target=\"_blank\">Mikadan</a>
    - a combination of two typefaces from the early 1900's.\r\n\r\nFor House Holiday
    Script, see the thin scripts in some of <a href=\"http://www.fontdiner.com/main.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Stuart Sandler's</a> various inexpensive packages.\r\n\r\nI
    know of nothing quite like House Holiday Sans."

  body: "My suggestion is that your designer spend their time finding substitutions
    for these House Industries fonts him/herself. Isn't that part of the job? \r\n\r\nI
    have a client who requests that I use fonts they already have licensed, but they
    give me their list of licensed fonts and I pick the fonts I want to use. I don't
    ask someone else to do that for me. "

    Mike, your suggestions are good. \r\n\r\nIn defense of myself, I think what I
    said is fair. For some companies their pricing isn't a deterrent once you figure
    in the time you save in stopping the hunt. "

    all kiss and make up. I wouldn't know if it'd end on such a positive note in other
    forums. I guess by now words like 'font nazis' would be flying around. :^D

    unfair to say, imo. i'd be interested in what you are able to find as suitable
    alternatives. (i'm doubtful that you'll find any 3 that will work together as
    well as the house collection). i guess i too am biased, i licensed this collection
    as soon as it came out as i had never seen a script quite capture this style of
    lettering before, the same can be said of the gothic. i'm afraid all the suggestions
    for a sans alternative would come from House..."
