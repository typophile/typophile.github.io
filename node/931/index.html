  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#39;m working on desiging &#40;or starting to design&#41; a signage system for a college, specifically for a particular building which used to be an office building, and so has lots of hallways and suites, and now classrooms. I don&#39;t really know where to begin. Can anyone recommend resources to refer to when developing a signage system of this sort? Anything I should keep in mind besides the basic legibility and such, particularly when choosing a typeface? Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really don&#39;t have much experience designing sign systems themselves. I&#39;ve only done one signage project ever, and it was only temporary. <BR> <BR>As far as typefaces go, the requirements for internal signage for an academic environment would be quite different form say an airport or a highway. For room labels, I dare say, would not be that much different than designing for print, say a poster. But for larger signs, those that would be read from a fair distance, as a rule, would need more space between letters than for print. What looks perfectly alright close up would appear much tighter when seen from a distance, hampering legibility greatly. Counters generally have to be large and open, again for legibility reasons. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have figures to support my arguments, or any hard and fast rules in terms of scale and how much the spacing should be. The best bit of advice I could give would be: always test at actual size. Do test prints, hang them up in the hallways, step back and see how well they read. That&#39;s essential. <BR> <BR>For a much more empricial approach, you should contact James Montalbano, who designed Clearview for US highways. He would be a much more appropriate person to ask for advice. He gave the most fascinating presentation at TypeCon. Are you around, James? <BR> <BR>Johnathan, maybe you would be interested in looking at Paul Mijksenaar&#39;s work? <a href="http://www.mijksenaar.com/index2.html" target="_blank">http://www.mijksenaar.com/index2.html</a> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To answer Hrant&#39;s questions: <BR> <BR>No, I don&#39;t need to respect any previous signage, because until now it&#39;s all been very inconsistent and not very good. There is, however, a new trademark: <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14202.gif" alt=""> which uses ITC New Baskerville and a bit of another face. The signage may or may not incorporate this logo. This is a Bible college, and so all the majors at this point are Biblical studies and training for pastors and that sort of thing. Therefore I&#39;d like a look which conveys an idea of ancient sacred dignity or something like that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although it is the &#39;corporate&#39; face for the college, I don&#39;t think Baskerville would be an appropriate choice for a signage system. The contrast is too high and the type too feeble to function well as a signage type. <BR> <BR>The &#39;corporate&#39; face for the Vancouver Public Library system is Didot, and, believe it or not, that&#39;s what they use for all their architectural lettering and signage across the system! It&#39;s bloody hard to read! The hairlines almost disappear! <BR> <BR>It sure would be nice to use something that subtly convey &#39;ancient sacred dignity&#39; in one way or another, but I feel that it need not be a serif type. Have you seen the new Anglican service books? They use Gill Sans in black and red they they look very diginified and religious. Yet modern. It&#39;s a great design, IMHO. <BR> <BR>I have a semi-sans that might work well for this project, but unfortunitely it hasn&#39;t been produced yet :-P</div>
