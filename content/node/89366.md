  belonging to the Cit\xE9 de l'architecture et du patrimoine in Paris. I believe
  they use the same for their signage. I'd be grateful for an ID -- I suspect this
  may be a custom face, but here's trying anyway.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nCyrus\r\n"

    an exact match, but seemingly had the same design brief when it was created:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typeotones/designal_family/"

  body: "Thanks for that marcox. I think I had pretty much come to a similar conclusion
    myself. Now that I look again, there unmodified DIN elsewhere on the page, but
    the 'Q' in the unicase had thrown me before.\r\n\r\nI came across Designal. A
    nice face, altogether. I'm ideally looking for something similar but it's crucial
    that it has regular, italic, bold, and bold italic fonts so itself that's a no-go.
    Any other suggestions along the same lines would be welcome, otherwise I'll keep
    scouring or just lump it and find a different angle to work from!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nCyrus"

  body: Amazingly enough "din unicase" (in quotes, as a phrase) yielded zero results
    in a google search. Now that's a marketing opportunity some enterprising type
    designer should seize!
