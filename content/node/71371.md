  the summer 2009 we\u2019ve been asked by Real Simple to customize Parisine PTF for
  their own use. We've adjusted few things for Real Simple and created new weights.
  Today, we've integrated this idea of intermediate weights into [[http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePTFGris|Parisine
  PTF Gris]]: A new Regular between the original Parisine PTF Clair Bold and Parisine
  PTF Regular (as on the image above). Bold follow same mechanism. Finally, it\u2019s
  also why this new sub-family was called *Gris* (Gray in English).\r\n<!--break-->\r\n--
