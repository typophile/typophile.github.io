  Its for an innovative new candle manufacturer. <BR>Rich<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33098.jpg"

- body: big candles! <BR> <BR>I think it does a good job of saying contemporary. Do
    you think the scale in width of the m and n could match the other letters better?
    If they were thinner, it might also help the logo balance out better.

  body: Rich, I really like it. I would suggest applying Brian&#39;s consideration
    about the &#34;m&#34; and &#34;n&#34; widths. I prefer the second &#34;L&#34;
    to the first one. Is this really &#34;hand made&#34; or do you mean homemade.
    It looks very computer generated, especially the curves

  body: I like the look of the type, but I&#39;m no face critic &#40;at least compared
    to the other ugys &#40;and gals&#41; here!&#41;. <BR> <BR>I will says this, though
    -- everything about this seems VERY much like it belongs with Element Skateboards.
    This is the type of type &#40;hehe&#41; they ofen use in their apparel, ads, and
    logotype.  <BR> <BR>Maybe this is no big deal, but wanted to make sure you knew
    of the association. <BR> <BR><a href="http://elementskateboards.com/" target="_blank">http://elementskateboards.com/</a>

  body: you should be commended for doing something from scratch. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>i&#39;d second Scott&#39;s suggestion for your curves.
    You have curve-straight-curve  <BR>thing happening &#43; the skewed bowl shape
    makes the &#39;l&#39; and &#39;t&#39; stand out as being too upright. <BR>Maybe
    the left side of the &#39;t&#39; crossbar could be reined in a bit. <BR> <BR>also,
    in context, the m feels a bit wide. the n &#43; n usually <BR>needs to be narrowed.
    <BR> <BR>And the bottom of the &#39;t&#39; might need to dip a little lower <BR>to
    rest on a common optical baseline. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering, however, how this
    contemporary look <BR>fits in with a candle manufacturer. <BR> <BR>does the company
    have a website  <BR> <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33596.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>might be easier for others to critique a weebit smaller. <IMG
