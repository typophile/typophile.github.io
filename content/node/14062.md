  trying to create a font with Corel Draw 10. It's been a while since I last did this,
  my past experience is with Corel Draw 3 and 4. This time I want to make sure to
  include all the basic characters in my font, including these:\r\n\r\neuro sign\r\nsingle
  low-9 quotation mark\r\nlatin small letter f with hook\r\ndouble low-9 quotation
  mark\r\nhorizontal ellipsis\r\ndagger\r\ndouble dagger\r\nper mille sign\r\nsingle
  left-pointing angle quotation mark\r\nleft single quotation mark\r\nright single
  quotation mark\r\nleft double quotation mark\r\nright double quotation mark\r\nbullet\r\nen
  dash\r\nem dash\r\ntrade mark sign\r\nsingle right-pointing angle quotation mark\r\n\r\nThe
  exporting dialog (as opposed to the really old versions of the program I am familiar
  with) makes me select a Character Block. I discovered that Basic Latin and Latin-1
  Supplement covere most of the basic characters I want to export. But the ones notes
  above do not show up in the selection.\r\nIf I try to put them onto the character
  number they used to occupy I get an error message of \"character code is not supported
  by windows\".\r\nI found the Euro sign in a Character Block by the name of Currency
  Symbols, which makes sense. But in fact it is the only currency symbol that shows
  up there.\r\n\r\nIs this a limitation of Corel Draw 10 or do I need to know a new
  character number to look for among the 65535 (minues the disabled ones) offered?\r\n\r\nI've
  been looking through Unicode documentations and generally searched wherever I could,
  but I am simply not that knowledgable in these matters.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  a solution for me, please?\r\nThanks very much for considering my issue."

    looking for it but of course only after bother others with it, I am in the clear.
    ^^\r\n\r\nApparently I can use the code numbers found here: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/unicode/greek.html\r\n\r\nIn
    any event, many thanks. I still appreciate any suggestions or explanatory comments
    because I am deeply interested in type and still don't quite understand all the
    different code number systems."

    create a typeface. I think it's ok to trace the characters on it, but it's not
    the right tool for making the font file.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
