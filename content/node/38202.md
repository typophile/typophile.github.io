  (like Eclat) but not quite as fat. I've looked at Monotype Script, Ballpark, Sedona,
  Ephemera, Casey, etc and can't quite find the right one. It has to have straight
  tops to the lowercase letters as opposed to rounded. Does anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nSomething
  like [[http://www.baseballatthebeach.com/_borders/Baseball%20at%20the%20Beach%20Logo.jpg|this
  image]] or the [[http://www.sportslogos.net/images/Baseball/NL/NYM_1235.gif|Mets
  logo]] would be great...\r\n"

  body: Hmmmm, not bad but it's a bit 'curlier' than what I was after. I'd prefer
    single extenders rather than looped ones. This [[http://www.logolounge.com/wd/uploads/67_indian.jpg|Indian
    motorcycles logo]] is closer to what I'm looking for.

  body: Thanks FP, I'd looked at Letterhead already and not seen anything that fitted
    the bill but LHF Royal is close, not perfect, but pretty good.

    I think Brewmaster and Home Run are about the closest. Thanks again for you help.
