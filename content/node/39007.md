body: Leopard has a new way of previewing fonts. Not the total solution but very fast
  and fun way of briefly looking at the basic design in a font. I just decided to
  translate one of my little articles to English http://font.is/?p=290 because I thought
  maybe some might find this useful. For many this is just obvious stuff but I am
  pretty sure that for some it will be a discovery.
