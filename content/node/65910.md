  body: "<em>why is the upside down glass the full one?</em>\r\n\r\nThe answer is
    on the page apankrat linked to: <em>This year\u2019s graphic was designed to play
    on \u201Cis the glass half empty or half full\u201D concept. Obviously, once the
    recipient rotates the bottle to fill their glass, the glass on the label becomes
    half full.</em>"
