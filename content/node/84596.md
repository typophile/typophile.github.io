body: I need some opinions on the letter spacing in this logotype. Does the negative
  space between characters look equal/uniform?  I've been staring at this thing for
  too long now, I could use some help from the pros.The logotype is for a restaurant
  that will be named Chefs' Palate. This lettering is all hand done so the line weights
  are still not equal, once I import to Illustrator I'll fiz those up but I want to
  get the letter spacing correct first. The crossbar of the f and the apostrophe form
  a heart, to add the element of love for what the chefs do.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_00001_6295.gif]

  body: "The heart is a cute idea, but it might be too much to put into this logo.
    \ The flow is not working from f to s.  This is overall a very nice script.  I
    think the f and probably s need to be reworked either way.  Great start!\r\n\r\np.s.
    there is a logo section of this forum where you might get better feedback."

    get the flow right on it. I'll keep working on it though. \r\n"

  body: "Looks nice!\r\n\r\nHere are a few ideas:\r\n- Try making the cap C smaller
    or bigger. For logos, making it bigger can work pretty well.\r\n- Try joining
    the f descender with the underline, and detach it from the s"
