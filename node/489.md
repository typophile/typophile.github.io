body: I&#39;ve just finished a 3 fonts typeface with all the settings &#40;kerning
  pairs and so on&#41;, and I really feel frustrated when I see the result in Illustrator.
  The leading is awful and I can&#39;t figure it out setting it in fontographer. <BR>
  <BR>Please somebody help me ! <BR>&#40;Tips in Fontlab are also welcome&#41;

  body: Guillame, <BR> <BR>do you mean the auto leading that Illustrator is giving
    the text when you type? if you tell a little bit about how you made your fonts,
    it might be helpful. for example, did you import the drawings from another program,
    or did you draw inside fontographer? also, did you change the ascenders and descenders
    while working on the font?

  body: Yes, it&#39;s the auto leading that Illustrator is giving the text. <BR> <BR>my
    font is all designed in Illustrator, then import in fontographer without dealing
    with ascent &amp; descent parameters. Import is made with a &#34;module&#34; that
    is the same for each element of the font.  <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t post a sample
    of this font because it has been design for a single client and we prefer to keep
    it safe before final release. <BR> <BR>Hope you can help me. Thanks

  body: As I said before, it&#39;s a font design for a company, and it will be used
    by several people. The <b>leading</b> has to be well set so that the global layout
    that we build could be respected. And Illustrator is not the only software that
    is in use for this font.

  body: Different applications handle default interlinear spacing in different ways.
    It is a while since I used Illustrator, but I&#39;m presuming that it works much
    the same way as other Adobe software; that is, it probably handles default leading
    as a percentage of the body height of the text. So, for example, default leading
    for 12pt type is likely to be 120%, i.e. 14pt leading. If you have a problem with
    interlinear spacing in such a program, it is because your glyphs are actually
    scaled incorrectly relative to the body height &#40;i.e. the UPM value&#41;. If
    your fonts are Type 1 format, they will have a UPM value of 1000, which means
    that you need to make your tallest glyphs fit within that height, or they will
    extend beyond the nominal body and may clash with other lines of text. <BR> <BR>Many
    other applications, e.g. MS Word, do not calculate default linespacing as a percentage
    of body height, but instead use &#39;logical unit&#39; font metrics that are provided
    by the system font renderer and based upon explicit values in the font. This is
    why the default linespacing between one font at 12pt and another font at the same
    size may vary. For Type 1 fonts, the logical metrics are calculated from the bounding
    box values. For TrueType fonts they are usually calculated from the OS/2 table
    vertical metrics on Windows and the hhea table vertical metrics on the Mac. <BR>
    <BR>Unfortunately, I&#39;ve no idea how to go about editing these values in Fontographer,
    since I don&#39;t use that tool. It is possible to directly edit the values in
    FontLab.
