  digitally. I actually contacted Martin who designed this font in the 70s' and confirmed
  that is has never been digitized.\r\n\r\nI desperately need this font for a project.
  Does anyone have an original Letraset sheet or Letraset book that has a page this
  alphabet in it that they could scan for me at 1200 dpi / ppi please? I would greatly
  appreciate it. I have attached an image of what I need. Thanks so much ~ Ted"

  body: "A full font was recently (just a couple of days ago) created by and posted
    by 'Mindofone' in Alt.Binaries.Fonts. The font is based on a high-resolution image
    from either a Letraset or Mecanorma rub-on catalog. The font is named \"Cathedral\".
    There are other existing fonts with the same name.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have access
    to that newsgroup, the original fonts (and ONLY original fonts) that are posted
    there (no it's NOT only a pirated fonts group) get added to \r\n\r\nhttp://abfonts.freehostia.com/\r\n\r\n
