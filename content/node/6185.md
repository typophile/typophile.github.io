    heaviest they have is 75lb--haven&#39;t found anything heavier. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: Used Glama once. It&#39;s pretty good stuff, and comes a nice range of weights
    IIRC.

  body: You might ... if you want to splurge ... look into GMUND&#39;s &#34;Gmund
    Colors Contact&#34;. Their &#34;Transparencies&#34; line has all patterns, but
    the &#34;contact&#34; has the transparency without the pattern and the weight
    you might need.

  body: IIRC = if I recall correctly = I&#39;m too lazy to type in proper English
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just hedging my recommendation since I don&#39;t have a Glama
    swatch book handy. But I&#39;m almost positive they have something in your weight
    range.

  body: Yupo has a pretty cool 104# Cover. If you&#39;ve never seen it, it&#39;s a
    synthetic paper that feels like a combination between film and paper. It would
    likely be a lot smoother than other translucents. If you are looking for a rougher
    finish, it probably isn&#39;t the right choice.
