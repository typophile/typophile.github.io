    you actually intend to _use_ the font? I assume free font offers are just for
    the people who collect fonts, as opposed to _using_ them."

    a logo. It's not like a sole Black Italic *needs* to be useless.\r\nBTW, there
    really are people who \xABcollect\xBB fonts <em>and</em> use them. "
