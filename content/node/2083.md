  probably be alternates for proper capitals, I suppose. What do you think so far?

  body: Wow, very nice. I always had a preference for those &#39;flowery&#39; types.
    I&#39;m a big fan of Jugendstil and this reminds me a bit of that. <BR>I would
    make this one type. I think you can mix the lc a and e with the UC. <BR>I love
    the R. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very interesed in the numerals. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren

  body: 'Kevin, they are great. I will not criticize the style. I think the irregularities
    of the type gives it it&#39;s charme.  <BR>I would maybe only change the upper
    serif of the UC F a little. It&#39;s to agressiv sticking forward. Just a little
    that you don&#39;t see the difference with the UC T. <BR> <BR>Perhaps make the
    horizontal leg of the 2 a little longer. It needs a bit more balance. '

  body: Is your &#34;Commercial At&#34; round enough. Is the left side too flat going
    round to the left and down? While I admire the R, will you run into some weird
    spacing issues? The way some of your bowls aren&#39;t conventionally shaped, such
    as the e and the P ... Hrant would maybe call the clotting but I think that is
    a negative term in this instance ... Should you have more of the rounding or filling
    in of the shapes in your N and M or X and Y? Do your joins end in too sharp a
    point?  <BR> <BR>Very interesting I can almost feel the Art Nouveau coming through,
    but your shapes aren&#39;t Art Nouveau.

  body: These are really beautiful forms, Kevin.  I love the new V. <BR> <BR>I also
    liked the old &#40;excited&#41; F, though it somehow didn&#39;t feel right; maybe
    making the arm &#40;is it called an arm?&#41; curve in the opposite direction
    could work, or even giving it some of the swaying movement of the A.  Could make
    an interesting alt.  Or maybe you could take a middle-of-the-road approach and
    make the F just a little bit excited.  That would be nice too. <BR> <BR>I might
    suggest flaring the stem base of the A just a tiny, tiny bit to the right; at
    the moment, it gives me this feeling that it&#39;s one of those paisley amoeba
    whatsits. <BR> <BR>Finally, something about your $ is bugging me; it looks more
    or less like a speared S rather than a symbol in its own right. <BR> <BR>Cheers!  I
    look forward to the completion of this face; I already have some ideas of where
    I might use it. &#42;sinister chuckle&#42;
