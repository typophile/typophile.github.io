  the alternate a and W/w on Raleway.\r\nSo I would like to make a copy of Raleway
  where the a and W/w are their alternates.\r\nIs there a way to do it without expense,
  or is there another workaround solution?"

  body: "The easiest way I see to do that without breaking spacing and kerning  is
    to use ttx which comes for instance with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html\">AFDKO</a>
    and modify appropriately the ttx files you will get as follows. \r\n\r\nI will
    assume you have sed (that comes with OS X and Linux). You could also use perl.
    The substitutions to make, in the sed syntax, are\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\ns/Raleway/RalewayW/g\r\ns/\"w\"/\"w.ORIG\"/g\r\ns/\"w.alt\"/\"w\"/g\r\ns/\"w.ORIG\"/\"w.alt\"/g\r\ns/\"W\"/\"W.ORIG\"/g\r\ns/\"W.alt\"/\"W\"/g\r\ns/\"W.ORIG\"/\"W.alt\"/g\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhere
    the first line changes the font name so as to be able to have both Raleway and
    RalewayW (the modified font) installed on your system. The other lines just swap
    the glyph names w.alt with w and W.alt with W.\r\n\r\nYou put those lines in a
    file, say mods.sed.\r\n\r\nIn order to get your modified version of Raleway-Regular.ttf
    you execute (in the railway font folder) the lines (with unix syntax, so that
    it works on OS X or Linux)\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nttx -t cmap -t GSUB Raleway-Regular.ttf\r\nmv
    Raleway-Regular.ttx Raleway-RegularW.ttx\r\nttx -x cmap -x GSUB Raleway-Regular.ttf\r\nsed
    -f mods.sed Raleway-Regular.ttx > modfont.ttx\r\nttx modfont.ttx\r\nttx -m modfont.ttf
    Raleway-RegularW.ttx\r\nrm -f *.ttx modfont.ttf\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nOn the Mac, you
    can just copy and paste those lines in the Terminal window. After a few seconds,
    you get your new font Raleway-RegularW.ttf and the kerning should work fine. Since
    there is no alternate for the small cap, it will stay as is but that probably
    makes no difference for your program.\r\n\r\nYou do the same with all the other
    fonts and you get your family. That can all be done on all 18 font files with
    a script if you are familiar with unix."
