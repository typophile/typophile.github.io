  was wondering about monitors.\r\n\r\nI actually have an 17' CTR, cheap and \"small\"
  but good...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? CTR or LCD?\r\nI read that LCD monitors order
  pixels very different from CTR, for me is very important couse i work web, type
  design and other graphic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall plasma monitors exist? hehe\r\n\r\nSalutations\r\nFerchules"

  body: "i've recently been in a large monitor spec'ing and ordering session for my
    current project - a CG animation rendering digital 4K frames for transfer to imax
    film format. the monitor color space management is a huge headache.\r\n\r\nhere's
    a few things i've learned:\r\n\r\nthe industry is in transition from CRT's to
    LCD's and the options are not yet optimized. there's a lot of groaning in the
    animation post-production industry these days on account of this netherzone we
    seem to be in between a clearly obsolete old standard and a not yet fully realized
    new one.\r\n\r\nLCD's are replacing CRT's industry wide. Sony, for example, is
    not even manufacturing their work horse CRT's anymore, but they can be found on
    e-bay. unfortunately, any monitor over 4 years old of unknown provenance is somewhat
    suspect. it used to be that production companies would have a CRT as their \"control\"
    monitor for precise color, as CRT's tend to be slightly more accurate and often
    more adjustable. as CRT's go the way of the dinosaur, however, there has not been
    a clear frontrunner in the mid-price LCD market. \r\n\r\nto my eye, the Apple
    LCD's look best out of the box, but offer very few calibration options. We have
    several cheap Samsungs at the office which are terrible. We make no critical decisions
    on those. avoid super cheap LCD's for critical color.\r\n\r\nyour best bet is
    to keep the little CRT you have as a second monitor and purchase the best LCD
    you can afford as the primary monitor. Compare images on both frequently, and
    calibrate both frequently. Pantone makes a handy little calibration tool.\r\nhave
    an image handy with which you are very familiar, including color bars, skin tones,
    sky, etc. \r\n\r\nas for the pixel order, your probably thinking of progressive
    scan (current) vs. interlaced (old school). progressive scan is the standard for
    computers, the web, and digital TV. Interlaced is a leftover artifact of NTSC
    video, and will soon be completely obsolete, although there will be some conversion
    compatibility in the appropriate hardware.\r\n\r\nthere's lots more detailed information
    available on-line in various user forums, including apple & adobe sites and at
    Creative Cow, which i highly recommend:\r\n\r\nhttp://cowcast.creativecow.net/\r\n\r\nthere
    are VERY expensive LCD's out there for graphics specialists - i think Panasonic
    makes one, but if they are prohibitively expensive i'd shop around online and
    look for calibration capability. \r\n\r\nin general i would avoid plasma screens
    as they are environmentally far more costly and polluting than the other types."

    because I had the ass-end of the monitor sticking into a window well.
