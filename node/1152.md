    Zuzana Licko. Further, Emigre--the foundry and the publication--are to be reckoned

    best, particularly whatever I&#39;m working on at the moment. But I have no idea
    whether it&#39;s good or bad. As an art director, I can never be sure whether
    one of my faces is suitable for a piece -- unless I&#39;ve seen someone else use
    it successfully in similar circumstances.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone else have a similar

    the equation, except insofar as it might give me a better idea of how well it

    the lowercase g comes out just right -- clicking into place like a box being shut,

    &#40;About which I can&#39;t say much more, due to legal considerations.&#41;
    Certainly for me, the fact that I can no longer use any of those fonts decreases
    the degree to which I think about them. <BR> <BR>T

    but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had the occasion to use it except once, and
    I forgot what it was for. It&#39;s one of those neglected typefaces. I don&#39;t
    think I&#39;ve ever seen it used much. Poppl is a brilliant calligrapher, and
    also quite a good type designer. Poppl Pontifex is another neglected design that&#39;s

    probably a mark of authenticity, or even denotes something as a registered trademark.
    I remember seeing it as a kid, but it&#39;s obsolete now. Though it&#39;s still
    part of the standard Chinese character set. The character is &#39;jing&#39; &#40;zheng
