  shop is portuguese home (1945) with a vintage look, and it\xB4s specialized in old
  traditional recipes. The shop is called \"A Casa da Isabel\" which means \"The Home
  of Isabel\" in english. I would like some suggestions, good or bad.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCalaba\xE7a"

  body: "Think there's too must white space at the top maybe bring the border down
    a tad. The lettering does'nt seem to be sitting very well  either some how. That
    registered sign may be getting in the way of things, perhaps bring it inside the
    L and scale it all fully justified.\r\n\r\nI like it tho. will it stay black and
    white and what does it look like scaled down to business card size?"

  body: "I guess you\xB4re right about the lettering not sitting very well. The registered
    sign is indeed getting in the way of things (client requested). I will try your
    suggestion. The logo is going to be in color, but i\xB4m still not sure which
    one. I already scaled it down, and it looks ok, but i\xB4m not satisfied with
    it yet!   "

  body: "In general i think you just need to tie everything together a bit more. all
    looks rather lose at the mo.\r\n\r\nJust quickly come away from topic for a second.
    When i view the logo in the browser and scale the browser down the logo scales
    too. How did you do that? I'm building my portfolio website at the moment and
    cant seem to do that. if you want send me a personal mail\r\n\r\ncheers"

    the logo in it and then export as a jpeg. After that i only attached the image.
    There must be something else that you\xB4re doing.\r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: "Do you need the border/frame? It might be a bit much.\r\n\r\nIf you keep
    the registerd sign, hang it outside the margin and make sure the 'L' in Isabel
    lines up with the top and bottom line.\r\n\r\nI'd also increase the size of the
    type so that it visually aligns with the house above. Right now you have the outer
    most parts of the type lining up with the illustration, but it doesn't 'feel'
    lined up. "

    you\xB4re right, it\xB4s better to hang it outside, but I feel that increasing
    the type size will make it too big. As soon as I have other version i\xB4ll post
    it."

  body: "Maybe it's just me, but I wonder if the execution of the \xABhouse\xBB drawing
    isn't too cold. It looks quite precise, almost like a technical drawing, but I
    wonder if it shouldn't have a bit more \xABflair\xBB \u2013 I would have expected
    it to feel a little more refined, also a little more inviting, possibly warmer.
    It's not much \u2013 don't go hand-drawing stuff or something \u2013 but maybe
    a subtle variation in stroke weight might do wonders. Or maybe try not showing
    every single line that's there (like on all 4 sides of all parts of both windows)."
