  you can see above, a few letters like the \"S\" and \"E\" are at a lower height
  than the rest of the letters when I use them at small point sizes in MS Word or
  Illustrator. I can't figure out why, because all of the letters have exactly the
  same height in Fontlab (see \"H\" and \"E\" above). It's an opentype PS font. Does
  anyone know how to correct this?"

    happens when you expand the type to outlines? Do the variances in height still
    appear? 2) Does it print similarly, or is this just an on-screen issue?"

  body: "The print is good, and when I make outlines it's also the right height, so
    it's only an on-screen issue.\r\nIt can't be bad hinting cause the letters \"S\"
    and \"E\" are pretty straightforward as you can see on the image, they have type
    1 hints. This is not my first font and I can't remember having this problem before.\r\nIt's
    as if fontlab adds a negative overshoot to these letters."

    use ADFKO autohint.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Extra negative horizontal hint_4108.png]\r\n\r\nI
    seem to have fixed it. I used an extra negative horizontal hint on top of the
    horizontal hint that was already their. This levels the height to that of the
    other letters.\r\nMaybe not the best method, but it works. If anyone has an better
    method that will fix this problem (preferable only with the use of Fontlab) I'd
    like to know, thanks :)"
