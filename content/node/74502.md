  font because text faces are a totally different kind of beast. Alas, working off
  of the open-ness of the Baskervilles I''ve looked at, I''m trying to design my first
  for-text typeface. It''s intended to be used at around 9pt. So, to further demystify
  the inner workings and details that create a readable text face, can I get a crit
  on the lowercase glyphs I have so far? '

    The r's ear could also be darker, I think.\r\nThe s is nicely balanced."

  body: "Something about the drawings seems off to me. I would try things like letting
    the u baseline serif dip under the baseline on its left side, and adjusting the
    the n/r top so the V-shaped counter's left side is more like | or \\ than /.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, you should make sure your bowls at their thickest are wider than your
    straight stems, in order to be optically balanced. (See how the vertical of d
    looks blacker than the left side of e?)"

  body: Thanks, will try that. As for the V shaped counters, making them lean like
    / was my superficial attempt at a creative flare. Is it too unnatural in that
    it would hinder legibility? Are there any typefaces that do that?
