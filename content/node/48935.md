  Rather than develop a trendy shield/crest sort of thing as he asked (ugh), I thought
  a simple logotype would be much better. I'm not particularly well versed in drawing
  letters from scratch (versions 1 & 2), so please be gentle.\r\n\r\nWith all of these
  the idea was to hint at a shepherd's staff with the lowercase f.\r\n\r\nhttp://metagramme.com/Flock_dd1_pres.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any/all advice.\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "Crests are definitely in right now. If you want to move away from that, focus
    on something that more clearly represents the idea of a flock, the staff-like
    F was completely lost on me. I love your custom text, but the logos look like
    they're for a trendy restaurant and not a college-aged ministry.\r\n\r\nWhat about
    creating something based of shepherding imagery that kinda fits the bill of a
    crest? Like this, only more custom:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/plasticmind/1269521880/in/set-72157601465024153/\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback...I tweaked the fl ligature to make the L read more
    clearly. \r\n\r\nI would respectfully disagree with the \"trendy restaurant\"
    bit.\r\n\r\nI don't think anything remotely crest-like would be a good idea. Crests
    are so completely played these days, especially for anything geared toward young
    people. It's even in Target, for crying out loud."

    wouldn't have gotten the shepherd's crook from the f had you not said anything
    I don't think, but I'm not sure it's completely necessary to be so blatant about
    it. I think if it were too apparent it might be distracting. As it is, I can see
    that you were influenced by the idea of the crook but still kept the idea from
    taking over.\r\n\r\nI think I'd stay away from the circle around the text as it
    looks quite a bit like the food network logo.\r\n\r\nIterations 3 and 4 remind
    me too much of the citibank logotype and I don't think they have the right character
    for this. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion I might make for number 1 would be to thicken
    the crossbar of the \"f\" a bit. Other than that, I think you've got something
    really great here.\r\n\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: Yeah...and that's the one the client is leaning towards. The guy respects
    my opinion, so I might try to steer him away from that version.

  body: "> <cite>Right now it\u2019s looking a bit like an I.</cite>\r\n\r\n#1 is
    very nice...beautiful letters! But your f-l combo does read like an f-i ligature,
    and the last thing you want people to read is fiock. Traditionally, in an f-l
    ligature, the f drips right into the l. I guess that takes away your crook, though...
    What if you just made the f taller to accommodate a fully ascending l?\r\n\r\n"

    like, you could push it a little further to include a SUBTLE Christian symbol
    in there.  \r\n-The \"f\" also has a nice built-in cross already that would really
    pop out if seperated from the ascender and descender.\r\n- maybe it's just a small
    tongue of fire floating above the \"o\""
