    Mac as of a year or two ago kicked consumer electronics a** out the door forever.
    This is not a rumor: for under US$1,000 U can 2 \u2014 with four boxes; (computer,
    screen, router and descrambler) and two boards, get Font Lab, TV, Radio (itunes
    & sat.), infinite music, photos, video, dvd, stereo surround something, the web,
    email,   +   recording, editing and scheduling of all of the above, except fontlab,
    know nothing special, take no great amount time in doing so...and, still have
    control of all your own data in formats no one is going to smush like their own
    private bug.\r\n\r\nSo, and this is based not entirely on Vinny's Vista upgrade
    saga (on the other thread that WAS about Vista Type?), you can add to your mac
    all the stuff I mention above, or upgrade to Vista for about the same price...hmmmmm,,,,,,"
