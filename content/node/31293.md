  body: Baby Mine isn't nearly of the same quality. This looks like a very professional
    customization of Eurostile -- maybe by a Danish designer such as one of the [[Fontpartners]]
    (hence the lack of some stems).

    <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MTA=\">Dispose is</a> another
    one, and it is a bit more adventurous than the others. Unfortunately its drawing
    is not as flawless as it is supposed to be and I don't agree with a couple of
    design decisions [[Lee Fasciani]] made, but it still is a kickin' face."

  body: Marten, I couldn't find a match on <a href="http://www.playtype.com/">Playtype</a>
    (then again, I doubt one can find <em>anything</em> with that totally useless
    navigation). Is this a custom face? Do you have additional information?

  body: "Thank you Yves! I remembered there were two type designs on t26 that had
    'nipped' stems and oblate rounds. I have a fondness for these designs. The first
    and my personal favorite was the old Burda patterns logo. And then there was BOO.COM
    where I started my love affair with shopping for funky trainers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Burda7995_6523.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhen
    you browse the playtype site, pass your mouse very near the right edge of the
    black rectangle, you should see the purple bar move there, click it, and you will
    see Zetta Sans. Vipp looks rounder, blacker than the zetta sample shown...may
    its just the low quality flash interface at playtype that is obfuscating the design.\r\n\r\n\r\nMike

  body: Now I've got the answer from e-types. They've developed the typeface themselves
    and simply calls it Vipp and it's available for purchase via <strong>anne (at)
    e-types.com</strong> <em>(just to save her from potential spamming)...</em>

  body: "<em>Yet another e-mail came to my inbox. This time from e-types project manager
    Mari Lea Randsborg. She's got the following to say about the Vipp typeface:</em>\r\n\r\n\xBBThanks
    for your interest in our typeface. - I'll be happy to elaborate on it: My colleague
    Jonas Hecksher (partner in e-Types) has made it and it is called Vipp. We made
    it for the company Vipp in 06 (danish company who have been selling metal bins
    since 1939 - you probably know it) as a part of a larger re-design -brushing up
    layout in ads, packaging etc. At the same time the vipp-logo was taken out of
    a elipse, where it was always placed beforehand, and now just used as it is -
    written 'vipp' - which of course influenced the letter design (logo/the four letters
    had to be recognizable and clearly visible). The shape of Vipp was inspired by
    especially the bin itself (very characteristic square/round 50's - steady, sturdy,
    functional, hard, industrial).\xAB "
