  body: "I remember there being a kind of \"gaming\" keyboard that let you move modules
    around for different configurations, but I think you were still limited to the
    basic staggered grid typewriter keyboard arrangement. \r\n\r\nMost keyboards you
    can yank the key caps out of and rearrange them, but you still have that same
    problem of the staggered grid arrangement, and that many keyboards have the keys
    contoured differently depending on their row.\r\n\r\nThen there is the [[http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/|Optimus
    Maximus]] keyboard with a tiny 48x48 pixel monitor in each key. It's been coming
    soon since 2005, but the guy who invented it is also a type designer so I'll cut
    him some slack.\r\n\r\nBut if you really want to move things around, perhaps the
    [[http://www.ergodex.com/mainpage.htm|Ergodex DX1 Input System]] is for you. Still
    not the steampunk typecase you're thinking of, but you could easily prototype
    one with that...\r\nWell you might need a few of them, since each only comes with
    25 keys. It looks more useful for developing custom controller layouts.\r\n\r\n"

    Maximus]] website, they have been shipping their keyboard since March of 2007.
    It's <em>very</em> pricey (just under $1700!), but if it works as advertised it
    would be just the ticket for people who work in multiple languages or who want
    lots of keyboard shortcuts for programs they use heavily. Take at look at the
    screenshot from their site showing a keyboard configured for Photoshop.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Optimus
