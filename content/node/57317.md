body: "I'm pretty amateur when it comes to typography and design, so looking for some
  honest feedback here. I'm designing a menu for a client, World of Beer. They have
  over 500 bottled beers, so the menu is pretty extensive. The table of contents will
  be as follows...\r\n\r\nBeer Basics - p.1\r\nBeer Styles - p.2-3\r\nBottle List
  - p.4-13 \r\nMixed Drafts - p.14\r\nWine List - p.15\r\nCigars - p.16\r\nFood -
  p.17\r\n\r\nTheir logo uses a variation of Copperplate Gothic, so I was looking
  to use that typeface for the headers, but I have no idea what to use for the body.
  \ I started with Arial, but definitely do not want to use that. I looked at Adobe
  Caslon Pro, and thought that looked better. Any other suggestions? Should i use
  a sans font b/c the headers are Copperplate, or does that not matter?  One thing
  to keep in mind is that the reader will be in a somewhat dimly lit bar, so readability
  is very important. \r\n\r\nAll comments welcome. I have thick skin :] Thanks in
  advance, J.W.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/menu1_5745.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/menu2_6433.jpg]"

  body: "Hi :)\r\nIt would be really great to see a pdf version.\r\n\r\nThe things
    I noticed as I scanned through:\r\nGenerally the type seems quite small and the
    look is very clean. \r\nIn the intro section, I'd remove the words 'According
    to Wikipedia'. I'd turn off hyphenation. That ellipsis needs to go.\r\nIn the
    Lager section, you have two spaces between the forst and second sentences. The
    word 'in' in the first line also looks disconnected. I'd justify the text as it's
    in narrow columns.\r\nThe 'Beer Timeline' needs more leading between the two lines
    of the title. It's not centred on the box. \r\nTypo 'Hops begins...'\r\nCapitalisation
    of 'Beer Making', 'Legions' and 'Brewers' pokes me in the eye.\r\n'Indians' is
    not the correct word for native Americans where I come from.\r\nIs WooHoo two
    words and does it need a capital H?\r\n\r\nOn the second page, the Name column
    needs the heading aligned with the text, as in the other columns. Wow, what a
    lot of beers! Would it be a good idea to sort them by brewery rather than alphabetically
    by name? I'd prefer the word 'style' to be 'type'...maybe that's just me though.\r\n\r\nLike
    the page numbering but perhaps bold would be a better contrast for the size of
    text.\r\n\r\nHope that's helpful :)"

  body: "Wow. Great info. Thank you! The menu is still in its very rough stages, but
    i appreciate all of the detailed info. I'm working on those changes now. I'll
    compile the whole thing into one PDF and upload it for everyone to see and critique,
    BUT I would really like to hammer out what fonts i'm going to use first, so that
    i can avoid having to make all those small alignment changes that come up when
    using different size fonts. Anyone have any ideas? Adobe Caslon Pro is the winner
    as of right now. \r\n\r\nOne stipulation that I am faced with when choosing the
    font for the body is that the bottle list portion of this menu will actually be
    generated through an ASP.NET application using Crytal Reports. It will be a centrally
    hosted application that is accessed by each different World of Beer location,
    who will then generate and print the menu at that location. I'm not yet sure how
    that will affect the flexibility what fonts i can use, or if it's as simple as
    having each location install whatever fonts we decide to go with. My thought is
    to lean towards a somewhat \"standard\" font, but i'm open to all suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for taking the time to write all of those comments. I replied to each below...\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>Generally
    the type seems quite small and the look is very clean.</cite>\r\n-- Do you like
    the Adobe Caslon Pro? Would it look better with a sans typeface?\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>In
    the intro section, I\u2019d remove the words \u2019According to Wikipedia\u2019.</cite>
    \r\n-- Agreed. Client provided that copy, but I think i'll have to veto that decision.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>I\u2019d
    turn off hyphenation.</cite>\r\n- Ok, wasn't sure about this. I personally don't
    like hyphenations. What if i full-justify the paragraphs under \"ALE\" and \"LAGER\"?
    Should i still turn off hyphenation?\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>That
    ellipsis needs to go.</cite>\r\n-- Replace with a colon? Or just put a period?
    Trying to lead into the ALE/LAGER section.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>In
    the Lager section, you have two spaces between the forst and second sentences.</cite>
    \r\n-- Oops. Will fix.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>The
    word \u2019in\u2019 in the first line also looks disconnected. I\u2019d justify
    the text as it\u2019s in narrow columns.</cite>\r\n-- True. Will justify the text.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>The
    \u2019Beer Timeline\u2019 needs more leading between the two lines of the title.
    It\u2019s not centred on the box.</cite>\r\n-- Agreed and agreed.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>Typo
    \u2019Hops begins...\u2019</cite>\r\n-- oops.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>Capitalisation

    is not the correct word for native Americans where I come from.</cite>\r\n-- very
    true!  \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>Is
    WooHoo two words and does it need a capital H?</cite>\r\n-- yeah, two words and
    no caps would be better.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>On
    the second page, the Name column needs the heading aligned with the text, as in
    the other columns. </cite>\r\n-- Yes. Was planning on aligning \"NAME\" with the
    letters of the alphabet below, and having those letters stick out a bit like they
    are so the reader can find them more easily. Would it be best to align all of
    it (header, items, and letters) the same?\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>Wow,
    what a lot of beers! Would it be a good idea to sort them by brewery rather than
    alphabetically by name?</cite>\r\n-- We went back and forth with this, but b/c
    of all of the consolidation of breweries, it's tough. I can't tell you how many
    product lines inBev now brews, and Groupo Modelo makes Corona, Modelo, Pacifico,
    Tropical, etc. We believe that it will be easier if we include the product line
    (e.g. Sam Adams) in front of the name, and order them that way. Sam Adams is made
    by Boston Brewing Company.  \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>I\u2019d
    prefer the word \u2019style\u2019 to be \u2019type\u2019...maybe that\u2019s just
    me though.</cite>\r\n-- Client prefers \"style\".\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>Like
    the page numbering but perhaps bold would be a better contrast for the size of

  body: "Ok, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest Plantin. I think a serif font
    is good. I find Caslon a bit light on the page and a bit too elegant somehow...I'm
    certainly not an expert though, so perhaps others can weigh in too.\r\n\r\n>What
    if i full-justify the paragraphs under \u201CALE\u201D and \u201CLAGER\u201D?
    Should i still turn off hyphenation?\r\n\r\nI'd see how it looks with justified
    non-hyphenated text. You can always play with tracking and word space manually
    if it looks uneven.\r\n\r\n>Would it be best to align all of it (header, items,
    and letters) the same?\r\nNot sure, maybe. I quite like the outdented alphabet
    letters.\r\n\r\nThat ellipsis at the start should grammatically be a colon; but
    because of the layout I think a full-stop would be better. \r\n\r\nThe second
    sentence is ungrammatical. It reads \"The basics of brewing beer ... are commonly
    categorized into two main categories\". You have a missing subject (beer) which
    needs to go in there. (It's not the basics that are categorised, it's the beer,
    isn't it?)\r\n\r\nActually, I'd reword the sentence completely because 'categorized...categories'
    is strange anyway. Perhaps: There are two main types of beer, and their methods
    of brewing are shared across cultures and national boundaries. Or: The two most
    common processes for brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries,
    and result in two main types of beer.\r\n\r\nIt's still not very interesting as
    a sentence. That's the problem with lifting text from Wikipedia; it's not written
    as menu copy ;) \r\n\r\nHow about listing the 'styles' of beer under the two headings
    so we can see whether 'Imperial IPA' or 'Dunkelweizen' is an ale or a lager?\r\n\r\nI
    might put more space between the hops and the text too.\r\n"
