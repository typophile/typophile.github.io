body: I have created a typeface in .otf PS format and want to use it in 3dsmax program,
  but I can't find my typeface. There is no problem in another program, just in 3dsmax.
  Why? Thanks a lot :)

  body: I've checked other font, .otf also, there's no problem at all. So, I think
    the problem is at my font. Can anybody explain this? Thanks :)

  body: Either export your face as a TrueType or if its not a longer text you can
    always import Illustrator outlines into 3dsMax. For that you need to save your
    outlines as legacy format Illustrator 3.
