  body: "Hi,\r\nThat's a really good one - it's part of the Partizan Belgrade Soccer
    Team logo.\r\nI would imagine that it's a custom job that only consists of those
    letters and not available as a regular font.\r\n\r\nAnyhow if you require scalable
    vectors of the complete logo then get my .eps version from here:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.eps\r\nor
    if you want it here's a pdf copy:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.pdf\r\n\r\nIt
    reminds me those crazy neon fonts in the old Letraset catalogue, Oxford, Uptight
    Neon, Yagi Link Double etc., but check out:\r\nhttp://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide03.html\r\nwhere
    you may find something similar (or maybe not)\r\nGood Hunting.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nDoghouse
