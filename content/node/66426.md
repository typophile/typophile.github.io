    you have. Its possible that there is an existing font similar or even based on
    the letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nbest regards. Steven"

    Engelhardt (primarily the Gentofte street signs, I believe) which he calls Skilt
    Gothic and which should be released by Font Bureau some time in the first half
    of this year.\r\n\r\nYou might contact Thavenius via this [[http://www.fontcaster.com/?p=3|contact
    page]] to see if he might have already done some work on the house numbers style
    that you seek. "

  body: "As Ken mentions, my upcoming release is based mostly on the Gentofte street
    signs and to some extent the design Engelhardt made for the Baltic Exhibition
    in 1914. Those designs are far from the curly figures in the sample above. \r\n\r\nThe
    street signs Engelhardt made were in a very rough gothic tradition with a lot
    of local flavor and a strong personal style.\r\n"
