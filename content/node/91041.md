  into a reference to Trajan Sans, his most recent design, included in Font Folio
  11.1:\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/03/robert-slimbach-25-years.html\r\n\r\nThe
  only other online reference I've found is a page in the Adobe Type Library Book:\r\n\r\nhttp://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/-/9780132964371/t/ch25sec1lev18\r\n\r\nI'm
  surprised I didn't notice this before, since a sans derived from the Roman inscriptional
  capitals is a very interesting feature, and a research that interested some very
  gifted talents, from Hermann Zapf to Sumner Stone. I wonder if anybody alse has
  got any other info about Slimbach's late typeface."
