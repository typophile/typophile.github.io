body: "Here's the scoop. This logo is for a client that was a city codes inspector
  for 28 years, retired, and started her own property management business. After many
  sketches the thought of a child building a structure using wooden blocks came to
  mind. Watching a child play with wooden blocks for me just said \"property management\"
  (blocks being the property and its arrangement by the child being the management
  part). I went with this idea because I feel people would identify easily with this
  concept.\r\n\r\nI used blocks stacked one ontop of another and placed one block
  away from the arranged group. I thought this would be a chance to illicit audience
  \"participation\". My hope is that someone would look at this card and subconsciously
  put the stray block in it's place, thus, getting a sense of what my client does,
  manage property.\r\n\r\nThe font I used is Warnock Pro. I'm still debating on whether
  to go sans (Scala Sans, can't show examples because I've yet to purchase the font)
  or serif. I just feel the serif would have a more humanistic feel to it (besides
  I think sans' are being used way too much for logo work). The color I used is pure
  cyan which I thought would be a good choice when newspaper advertising come into
  play to avoid registration problems but I might go with another color.\r\n\r\nThis
  logo is still in its early stages. But I would really appreciate feedback before
  I begin the refinement process.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nIvan M\r\n"

  body: "Hey Conor\r\nThanks for the spell-check. I was doing it pretty quickly and
    I'm a horrible speller and typist. But I am a good proofreader when given enough
    time.\r\n\r\n<cite>Stacked building blocks is quite a clich\xE9ed device.</cite>\r\n\r\nIn
    away I agree, but I chose this one as an alternative to an even more used clich\xE9;
    a house. I'll definitely explore it more (ideas are flowing as I type).\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the feedback. Keep it coming!\r\n\r\nIvan M"

  body: "Also, it's okay to have the next building block nearby - but why not put
    it in front of the word \"WITH\" and use it like a bulleted point?\r\n\r\nSome
    of your locations for it looks like it was just a left over... and doesn't fit.
    At least this is my opinion... maybe not others."

  body: "Hey Heron20001\r\nI do agree 100% with your comment. It was not my intention
    to turn the stray block into a bullet but now that you mention it I guess it does
    look like one. And as far as locations for the stray block goes I also agree that
    it doesn't fit. But I still feel having a stray block is necessary. I want to
    convey the feeling of a need for organization. I'll have multiple revisions (keeping
    these suggestions in mind) to show soon. Thanks a million!\r\n\r\nIvan M"

  body: "I'm in no way a professional designer, but I love the Warnock. It's unexpected
    for a logo that represents a former code inspector. I also like the light blue
    \"Burns Glover\" of letter d. But I think you should flip the 3 cube logo 90 degrees
    clockwise so with the missing piece, it resembles a lower-case b (I suppose it
    would look like an upper-case L too, but I would associate it with a b since the
    company is \"Burns...\"). Lastly, I think the tagline would read better if it
    were \"Over 25 Years of City Codes Experience.\"\r\n\r\nBut I like it a lot!\r\n\r\n-Scott"
