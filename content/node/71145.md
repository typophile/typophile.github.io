  a Typographic Comic. It uses all type and no images ... it's different than most
  comic books but can still carry a narrative experience.\r\n\r\nI have started a
  kickstarter campaign to help support this kind of project. So far I haven't gotten
  much support, not sure if it's a project most people are into. I am reaching out
  to fellow type lovers to see if you can help. If you know anyone that might be interested
  please feel free to pass the kickstarter link on to them, also if you are on facebook
  or twitter any mention help would greatly.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1529426808/typographic-comics?ref=email\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I will be presenting at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art on Thursday July 22nd,
  at 7pm in NYC. The presentation is titled Typographic Comics!\r\n\r\nWish me luck,
  I think I need it.\r\nJames\r\n\r\nps. I emailed Typophile to make sure it was ok
  to share this info, I didn't want to seem like I was spamming."

  body: As a type person, cartoonist, comics reader, self-publisher, and someone who
    has made Kickstarter contributions, I want to tell you that I think there are
    some things wrong with your model. For commercial ventures, Kickstarter works
    as quid-pro-quo, not charity. What this means is that contributors are going to
    want at least the same value for money as someone who waits until it's all over
    to purchase the result with less risk. Basically what I'm saying is that you've
    priced a comic book at $50.

  body: "mmm ... I think you make some good points. Maybe I didn't really think that
    part out as well. I think I was so focused on my project and making the video
    I missed the rewards value part. Since I haven't gotten any backers, I'll go back
    and readjust my rewards ... maybe that help. Thanks for the honest comments.\r\n\r\nBesides
    that is this type (no pun intended) of project something that you or your friends
    might be interested in?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJames"
