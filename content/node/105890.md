  body: I'm pretty convinced this is set using the latin counterpart of [[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/c-j-ngai-hk|CJ
    Ngai]], font for Chinese language, which makes sense when we know we're talking
    here about the (former) [[http://www.google.com/search?q=cowin+electronics&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch|logo]]
    of Shenzhen electronics manufacturer [[http://www.cowin-electronics.com.cn|Cowin]].

  body: "Thanks Ryuk. \r\nIt does look very similar to CJ Ngai (Good call), although
    there are some subtle differences, such as the verticals on the 'O' are wider,
    and some characters slightly rounded at the corners. The 'logotype' characters
    on the whole also appear to be extended.   \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C

  body: Have you simply try to squoosh it, manually compressing it to reduce x-height?
    That's too close not to be it.
