  body: "Bill, a superb and rather illuminating article.\r\n\r\nI also just read and
    enjoyed your article in <em>Reform Judaism</em>, titled <em>Einstein's Religious
    Awakening</em>. Now I know that this might not be the correct forum, but... I
    did have two comments to make regarding the later article.\r\n\r\n1. Why is the
    title (and your name) set in <em>Adobe Caslon</em>??? In fact, why is the magazine
    set in TNR? Please help them see the light (typographically speaking)! I would
    much rather read the magazine set in your own beautiful rendition of Caslon.\r\n\r\n2.
    Was Einstein's \"awakening\" not a <em>spiritual</em> one, rather than a \"religious\"
    one?"

  body: "Thanks, Adam. On the typography. \r\n\r\nThey have used Adobe Caslon for
    display and TNR for text for a long time. Actually I think Adobe Caslon is rather
    nice for display; I don't think it works so well as text. Of course, I think my
    Williams Caslon Heading and Display would be still better, but they're not yet
    complete or published. I do think that Williams Caslon would be much better suited
    for the text of this magazine. TNR is a great face, but rather impersonal and
    a bit cold. But I'm not the designer of the magazine, it's not my call.  \r\n\r\nI
    also didn't do the title of the article, which I only saw after publication. I
    do think it is accurate to call what happened to Einstein as a child a religious
    awakening, though I don't use those words in the article. Later when, as a pre-teen,
    he firmly rejected a personal God, but kept a deep religious feeling about his
    work, I think it is a toss-up whether you call it spiritual or religious. He himself
    says that in one sense, but only one, he is \"deeply religious.\" \r\n\r\nEinstein's
    religious views are fascinating and hard to categorize, which is what the article
    is about. I had a lot more to say, but they cut it down to a journalistic report
    on Einstein, and not an assessment of his views, which I did a draft of. Another
    time and place, I hope ...\r\n\r\nps For anyone interested, the article (without
    the print formatting) is [[http://reformjudaismmag.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1828|online

  body: "William, \r\n\r\nThank you for the detailed response. \r\n\r\nThe reason
    that I made the comment regarding <em>spiritual</em> versus <em>religious</em>,
    is simply because the term religion (and thus, religious) is, for the most part,
    associated with doctrine, or any form of a defined <em>system</em> of belief.
    As far as I know, Einstein never attended shul, prayed \"Adon Olam\", or proclaimed
    \"Pour thy wrath upon the Gentiles\" during a Seder. He was (as you mentioned)
    \"in awe of the heavens\", and saw God's silhouette in the very fabric of creation
    and the universe. As such, I believe that the term \"spiritual\" is perhaps more
    appropriate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Einstein's increased sense of spirituality was, at
    least in part, due to the apparent failure of the greater Logical-Positivist project.
    Kurt G\xF6del\u2019s <em>Incompleteness Theorem</em>, which delivered the coup
    de gr\xE2ce to Logical Positivism, also left the door (slightly) open to more
    spiritual (and less positivist) conceptions of the natural world\u2014it let some
    \"mystery\" into the equation.\r\n\r\nNow, just to keep the topic within the realm
    of typography, I agree that TNR is a superb typeface (for columns), but its ubiquity
    makes the magazine look cheap, and it certainly lacks the so-called \"air of authority\"
    that a good Caslon commands. I will write to the editors and share my typographic
    misgivings with them."

  body: "I think that Einstein's spiritual or religious feelings were very strong
    from his childhood, and never diminished. Einstein was a friend of G\xF6del, I
    believe, but he had a very strong feelings about the mystery of the natural world
    from his early teen years, long before the incompleteness theorems. (This is what
    I get from Max Jammer's book.) Also there are many reasons to see mystery in the
    world other than G\xF6del. This is not the place to go into it, but I do discuss
    it in my new book, Pirke Avot: Timeless Wisdom for Modern Life.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Very enjoyable essays, Mr. Berkson. Are you planning additional installments
    to discuss the specifics of your display and heading sizes? Given how independent
    Caslon's optical sizes are, I'd think you'd have more to say on the subject than
    most. I'm intrigued by how eclectic Caslon's influences are across those sizes.
    Have you been able to trace any of the specific influences, or do any specific
    sizes stand out as more idiosyncratic than the rest?\r\n\r\nWilliams Caslon is
    likely to become my favorite Caslon revival. As much as I appreciate Justin Howes's
    magnum opus, I don't have any of the right applications for it in the kinds of
    works I publish. Adobe Caslon, as important a work as it is, lacks that essential
    Caslon warmth as you discuss in your essays; also, for my purposes, it lacks italic
    small caps, which are essential to taming the menagerie of acronyms I have to
    work with.\r\n\r\nHas Typophile run a thread yet about the release of Williams
    Caslon Text? If so, I haven't been able to locate. If not, they should.\r\n\r\nThe
    earlier Caslons thread on Typophile should also be extended to mention the release
    of your text size, since it does mention your work in progress a couple years
    ago. Also, the Caslon page in Typowiki should be updated to reference and link
    to it.\r\n\r\nOn a complete side note, would you be willing to entertain the idea
    of adding small-caps lining figures to Williams Caslon Text? I know you have plenty
    of more important things to worry about with your project, but I sure could use
    them to help tame variable names, program names, Canadian ZIP codes, and other
    alphanumeric scrambles.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, could you give us a status update
    on Williams Caslon Display and Heading? I'm in no way wanting to pressure you
    to finish sooner - things need to cook until they're done - but I'm sure I'm not
    alone in being genuinely interested in what you're working on."

  body: "Frederick, thanks for the kind words. \r\n\r\nWilliams Caslon Text does have
    small caps lining figures. You can access them by going to Character/Open type/All
    small caps. Unfortunately, in InDesign the \"Open Type\" option, at least in CS4,
    is well hidden. You have to click on the box at the top right of the Character
    window to access it. \r\n\r\nOn the Display and Heading sizes. A basic character
    set for the Roman exists for the Heading Medium size, and for a \"Small\" text
    size regular. The Heading size Medium is based pretty closely on the Great Primer
    of Caslon, 18 pt., and the proportions of the Small text is based on Caslon's
    Long Primer, about 9.5 pt. These are both sizes that historian James Mosley singled
    out, I think rightly, as some of Caslon's best. I also did the a small set of
    characters of Display italic for my [[http://www.jewishpub.org/product.php?id=444|recently
    published book.]] (I didn't do the cover.) The display italic is more of my own
    thing. \r\n\r\nHere is the display italic in the book:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avot_Acknowledgments_grab_4670.png]\r\n\r\n.\r\nAnd
    here is a bit of the Small in the Appendix:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avot_Appendix_grab_3851.png]\r\n\r\n.\r\nI
    had been thinking to wait for demand to do the Display and to complete the rest,
    but now I'm thinking that having the rest will really help to get the Text size
    out there. In fact, I had to continually restrain myself from increasing contrast,
    which magically makes everything more pretty and elegant, though in my view less
    good for text size. So I will get to this sooner rather than later, but I dare
    not say how quickly\u2014unless there is a commission to finish it, of course!"

    Williams Caslon will be my next typeface purchase. Keep up the great work."
