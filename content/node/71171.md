body: "As you might now, the long awaited, 15+ years, version 1.0.0 of STIX fonts
  have been finally released. However, the release disappointed many people who want
  to typeset mathematics with STIX fonts, as they neither released LaTeX support files
  nor supplemented the fonts with the new OpenType MATH table, ruling out any quality
  mathematical typesetting engine.\r\n\r\nFortunately, STIX were kind enough to release
  the fonts under Open Font License, so giving the community the power to scratch
  their itch and not wait yet another 15 years for next release.\r\n\r\nHaving experimented
  with an OpenType MATH version of STIX beta release, it was relatively easy to supplement
  the final release with MATH layout features, thanks to the powerful FontForge who
  never let me down, and so XITS was officially born.\r\n\r\nDespite being written
  in all caps, XITS in not an acronym but a funny way to get around the reserved name
  clause if OFL, which I never liked BTW, it also hints the long term goal to enhance
  it with right to left mathematical typesetting capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe font is
  still beta as regards the OpenType layout, any help or feedback is highly appreciated,
  especially testing with MS Office 2007 since I no longer have access to Windows
  machine and thus did all my testing on ConTeXt/LuaTeX.\r\n\r\nAfter the poring introduction,
  here is the download link:\r\nhttp://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math/downloads\r\n\r\nAnd
  here are some examples:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits-specimen_6154.png]"

    the font menu, XITS Math appears very small (it's also the case for Asana Math,
    but not for Cambria Math, so there must be a way around it).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-002_word_2007_menu_3662.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    the formula with P(x,y), the P is very close to the parenthesis; I tested with
    other letters like F and the problem is the same, but doesn't happen with letters
    like G so it seems the italic correction is not taken into account, as seen on
    the formula F_1^2:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-002_word_2007_P_ic_4581.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    the first formula, when I tried to build it up with large delimiters everywhere,
    a strange result appeared:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-002_word_2007_del_size_6252.png]\r\n\r\nSizes

    Asana:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asana_word_2007_del_size_5699.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly,
    when I tried to make a PDF with PDFCreator, a PDF was produced, but it only contained,
    after a first page blank, the following error message:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nERROR:

    Cambria, so it must be something in the XITS fonts which causes it.\r\n\r\nI hope
    this helps you. It's good to see people working on math fonts."

    of it, it doesn't show in either LuaTeX or XeTeX (both support OpenType MATH),
    can any one with more knowledge about Office implementation help tracking this
    down?\r\n\r\nThe 4th issue is related to this too, there is something wrong with
    glyph assembly but I cannot identify.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd issue results from the very
    large WinAscent/Descent values in the font, which is needed to avoid clipping
    large glyphs. Though the font have TypoAscent/Descent and fsSelection bit 7 set
    properly, they are ignored by office for reasons I don't know. Not sure what Cambria
    does, but it could be because of its embedded bitmaps that don't have any of the
    large glyphs.\r\n \r\nThe 3rd issue is due to lack of italic correction for the
    capitals, I'm already working on it.\r\n\r\nThe PDF issue is strange, could you
    try other PDF generators? it is like a bug in PDFCreator that got triggered by
    XITS."

  body: "I'm testing the current beta (1.004) in every bit of software I can, and
    so far I've only found a few problems.\r\n\r\nFirst, the delimiter issue Philippe
    mentioned is likely caused by the lack of extendable floor/ceiling brackets\u2014I
    noticed that, unlike Cambria and Asana, there's no entry for them in the Vertical
    Construction part of the MATH table, so they max out at the .size4 variant.\r\n\r\nIn
    ConTeXt/LuaTeX, using \\vec with Greek letters causes the arrow to be offset to
    the left, possibly because none of the italic Greek math letters have Top Accent
    values.  This isn't an issue in XeLaTeX (using unicode-math) or Word 2007.\r\n\r\nThere's
    also a problem with \\vec and some Greek and Latin lowercase italic math letters
    in XeLaTeX (d,f,m,w,\u03BA,\u03BC,\u03C0,\u03C3,\u03C6 (both forms),\u03C7,\u03C8
    and \u03C9; I haven't tested non-italic or uppercase letters yet) where adding
    an exponent or prime outside the \\vec command causes the arrow to both drop closer
    to the letter and lengthen, colliding with the exponent.  This may actually be
    a unicode-math or XeTeX bug.\r\n\r\n"

    yet.\r\n\r\nThe \\vec issue is now fixed too, almost. I added top accent position
    to Greek, except bold upright, it is a boring job :)\r\n\r\nThe XeLaTeX issue
    is known, it has been reported to Jonathan Kew while ago, but I don't think it
    is going to be fixed any time soon. In my experience, LuaTeX has much better OpenType
    MATH support, but unicode-math package has incomplete LuaTeX support, so my recommondation

    suppose it\u2019s due to relative heights of math delimiters, which are not always
    the same as Computer Modern, so the problem might not be fixable without redesigning
    the large delimiters.\r\n\r\nAnother problem, which has not changed since version
    1.004 is a few italic correction and sub/supscript kerning issues. The main problem
    is with Blackboard bold symbols, some of which lack italic correction; the A also
    lacks negative kerning for the exponent:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-004_ic_mathbb_4617.png]\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
    marked the L with a \u201C?\u201D because it might not be a good idea for this
    character to add negative exponent kerning (I know it\u2019s been done with Times
    569 4-line Mathematics, but it was for an italic <em>L</em>).\r\n\r\nMost of the
    mathcal letters would also benefit from having italic correction:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-004_ic_mathcal_4227.png]\r\n\r\nFinally,
    some of the upright capital letters (in all forms: roman/italic, medium/bold,
    serif/sans, latin/greek/nabla) would benefit from italic correction or exponent
    kerning:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-004_ic_upright_5729.png]\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I've installed the unicode-math package under MikTeX 2.8 to try XITS Math in XeLaTeX
    and noticed that many symbols don\u2019t come up correctly:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-005_xelatex_6234.png]\r\n\r\nDo
    you have any idea where this is coming from? (There\u2019s no problem with Cambria

    symbols with XeTeX are likely to be caused by presence of more than on version
    of the font accessible to XeTeX (e.g. one system wide copy and one installed in
    TEXMF tree), make sure you have only one version of the font (or identical copies),
    having different version of same font installed is known to lead to such issue
    in XeTeX.\r\n\r\nThe script alphabet is a bit trickier, the glyphs are spaced
    as italics, so the width of the glyph equals the width of the bounding box, that
    is why subscripts are so far. Here italic correction will not help, we instead
    need to use math kerning support in OpenType math, but I'm unlikely to do this
    for the first \"stable\" version (no much time for math fonts right now). The

    when you use the vertical bar to denote a restriction:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xits_1-005_restriction_symbol_6073.png]\r\nI
    suppose something can be done at macro level (I'll have to look up the code of
    unicode-math), but if in the future you decide to change some glyphs in XITS,
    this one would be a good candidate."

  body: I generally agree with you, it looks odd in general, I usually assume STIX
    project took maximum care in designing each glyph, but the more I work on it the
    more I feel it might not be always the case, so I'm adding this to the list of
    to be considered glyphs.

  body: I uploaded 1.006 which should fix the bar issue and the sscripts with double
    struck letters, more final sscript tuning in the future. I'm going to upload it
    to CTAN, so it goes to TeXLive 2010 before it is frozen. Let me know if there
    are any other issues.

  body: I finally managed to fix the PDFCreater issue, it was caused by erroneous
    OS/2 code pages being set  in the original STIX fonts (code pages for which the
    fonts include no characters), thanks to this [[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3127933&group_id=328428&atid=1378225|STIX
    bug report]]. The files on git now print OK with PDFCreater and should be available
    in 1.009 (next) release.

  body: Hi, I have a problem with XITS font. I use Microsoft word (both 2007 and 2010),
    and when I tried to export to pdf using its built-in add-ins, some characters
    in the equation are missing, such as integral, rackets, etc. The problem does
    not appear with Cambria or Asana font.
