body: 'Does anyone know which Garamond would look best in the following books: 1&#41;
  a detective story; 2&#41; a historical fantasy novel for children. <BR>I intend
  to use my Bitstream collection which has the Bitstream versions of Stempel Garamond,
  Garamond #3 and Sabon. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t like very thin fonts such as digital
  Bembos. <BR> <BR>What kind of printer should I have in order to see the fonts exactly
  as they will look in the final result &#40;=book&#41;? I think the printer should
  be able to emulate Postscript or something. <BR> <BR>Or should I forget Garamonds
  and use something else, such as ITC New Baskerville or Minion which I also have?
  &#40;Although Minion looks condensed, intended for narrow columns only and perhaps
  too modern&#41;. How about Trump Medieval &#40;Kuenstler 480&#41; or Bitstream Kis?
  Please help.'

    and &#34;good&#34;.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>For a detective story I think any Garamond
    would look somewhat awkward &#40;although few people would actually complain explicitly&#41;.
    What to use instead: could you give more details, like more info about the story,
    how long it is, etc.? <BR> <BR>Garamond is more appropriate to historical topics,
    but then you have to say what target age it&#39;s for - because below about 10
    years of age children don&#39;t read very immersively, so something like ITC Garamond
    &#40;shudder&#41; would actually be good. <BR> <BR>The printer: more than imaging
    language, <i>resolution</i> is your biggest concern. From what James Montalbano
    has said, on a &#34;desktop&#34; you can only get a true idea of the final result
    by using a 2400 dpi laser &#40;because the lower the resolution the more gain
    in the letterforms, throwing off the color and texture&#41;. If that can&#39;t
    happen, you might do some early testing of one key page directly on lino/velox,
    then work &#34;semi-blindly&#34; from there - pretty normal procedure anyway.

  body: Aku, <BR>Are you asking which of the faces you already have to use or are
    you asking what is the best solution for the job at hand? If the latter then we
    need to know more about the storyline, place time, etc. &#40;as Hrant mentioned
    above&#41;.  <BR>In my opinion, the actual typeface used for the body text has
    less to do with conveying the intent of the subject matter than the display fonts
    selected and how the typography is designed on the page.  Those of us here on
    this list are far more likely to be sensitive to typographic nuances than the
    average mystery novel reader so you can choose a good neutral text face with good
    readability from your collection and focus your design abilities on the front
    matter, chapter dividers, and cover to convey the meaning of the content. <BR>

    time, yes it has a killer but no detective. It is targeted for the middle-aged
    and elderly. It is not very long. In front of me I have an old UFO book &#34;Sky
    people&#34;. It is set &#34;in 12 on 13 point Intertype Baskerville&#34;. Looks
    very clear to my eye. Yes, no Garamond for the detective story - perhaps 11/14
    point ITC New Baskerville would do the trick? <BR> <BR>I intend to use the faces
    I already have. However, if you experts come out with a clearly superior choice,
    I could reverse my decision. I am a spineless weakling! <BR> <BR>The historical
    novel is targeted for girls of 9-12 years. It is set in ancient Egypt of the pharaohs
    but with time travel. How about Zapf Calligraphic 801 &#40;=Palatino&#41; for
    this - it would be easy to read but would it be boring too? Do boys and girls
    prefer the same fonts? <BR> <BR>Just for curiosity - what you would choose for:

    not that kind :-&#41; face for a short novel. Maybe a bit too &#34;rational&#34;,
    but if it smells like a detective story then maybe just right. Which cut of Baskerville?
    That&#39;s where the usage experts are needed... <BR> <BR>The historical novel:
    Palatino might actually be very fitting, since its somewhat large x-height &#40;compared
    to its more bookish sister, Aldus&#41; might be just the thing for the transition
    from non- to immersive reading. The main problem with Palatino though is that
    it&#39;s too common. So maybe Trump or Kis would indeed be better overall, although
    you&#39;d have to set them a bit big &#40;like 12&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; Do boys

  body: For historical fiction, why not a typeface that is itself an historical fiction?
    <BR> <BR>By that I mean one that is not a revival, but done in the style of a
    bygone era. <BR> <BR>And depending on how much anachronism there is in the story,
    that could effect the decision also. <BR> <BR>For instance, Storm&#39;s &#34;Sebastian&#34;
    is an anachronistic historical fiction -- a sans serif from the 18th century --
    so would be suitable for stories involving modern gadgets &#34;time-transported&#34;
    into the past.

    <BR>You&#39;re being rather severe with &#34;in any way&#34; -- surely the typography

    without being heavy-handed?

  body: Imagine that, somethink Nick and I actually agree on. <BR> <BR>Indeed, if
    the typeface choice doesn&#39;t need to resonate with its content in any way,
    we wouldn&#39;t need more than a handful of functional typefaces in the world.
    <BR> <BR>I believe that the typeface choice shouldn&#39;t &#42;get in the way&#42;
    of the content, but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t &#42;enhance&#42; the content.
    That&#39;s sort of the purpose of having typefaces, in my mind. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

    setting in Indesign. My understanding is that if I use the default tracking &#40;zero

    How can I find the correct setting - is there a rule of thumb?
