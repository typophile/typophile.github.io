body: "Hi there,\r\nWe keep having a problem when wanting to insert manual line breaks
  while using the Adobe Paragraph Composer setting (applied on a Paragraph Style).
  Are we missing some basic setting - is there a way to 'override' the Paraph Composer
  locally? I.e. applying a manual break without affecting the rest of the paragraph?\r\nIn
  the following images you can first see a sample paragraph the way it is handled
  'by default'. When trying to fix one of the lines, breaking before the word 'used',
  the whole paragraph gets shifted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4096.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5362.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any ideas or suggestions regarding this, we'd be more than happy. Or any
  advice on the hyphenation zone setting that we don't quite manage very well and
  might well have some impact on the problem we're having.\r\nThank you,\r\nFredrik,
  Nina"

  body: "<cite>So is this a limitation of the Paragraph Composer?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    sort of the point of paragraph composer. Paragraph composer is not designed with
    much user intervention in mind, and works better for justified copy than ragged.
    If you want to start breaking stuff manually switch to single-line composer. "

  body: "I would hardly call it a \"limitation\".\r\n\r\nWhat InDesign is trying to
    do, in Paragraph Composer mode, is to equalize the space widths of the <em>entire</em>
    paragraph. That's best visible with justified text, but it also works with ragged-right
    text. It appears it works backwards from the manual line break for the first part,
    and forwards for the rest.\r\n\r\nPutting in manual line breaks should be a last
    resort, as these will always bite you back when editing the text afterwards. Try
    using \"No Break\" on just those words you want to keep together. That will allow
    ID to use its own judgement on where the exact line breaks will come. I use that
    function so much for these sort of manual tinkering, I've assigned a shortcut
    key to it.\r\n\r\nIf you intended to get rid of the \"used\" because it sticks
    out of the rest, you could try fiddling with the hyphenation settings. The \"Hyphenation
    Zone\" doesn't mean much to me, but you could try moving the \"Better spacing
    - Fewer hyphens\" slider either way.\r\n\r\nIf you desperately need <em>total</em>
    control of the paragraph (all of them or just this one), switch to the Line Composer.
    That'll behave the way you are used of lesser programs (!)"

  body: "This is just an observation, but why are you adding a break before \"used\"?
    Your rag in the original is nominal, and hyphenation is limited, but as soon as
    you force return, you get twice as many hyphens and the ragging seems to become
    more prevalent. And if you forced return because \"used\" was too close to the
    margin, you've now force \"found\" a few lines lower even closer.\r\n\r\nLike
    I said, just an observation.\r\n\r\nIt's paragraph specific (return to return),
    but you can switch between single-line and paragraph composer. So if you want
    to manipulate a single paragraph, this might lead to a more suitable solution."

    of the manual line break that had me asking in the first place :)\r\n\r\nIn any
    case, for my purposes, I'll simply use the single-line composer and manually fix
    the rag.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Fredrik,\r\n\r\nCould you post an image of the same paragraph with your manual
    tweaking? I'd love to compare the overall look of that against ID's automated
    (mathematically optimized) solution.\r\n\r\nFor justified paragraphs, I'm almost
    always satisfied with how ID handles it. Mainly I adjust by hand to avoid a bad
    break (a visual one, not technical), or to keep \"I\" or \"A\" and the next word
    on a single line -- just to be picky.\r\n\r\nRagged-right paragraphs are harder
    to judge, because of the big differences between two tries, but, while I don't
    always take ID's breaks for granted, I'm always struggling to get the overall
    look I want."

  body: I'm struggling with paragraph composer as well. I appreciate the way it formats
    paragraphs, but bridle at losing control over the setting of type. I wish there
    were a happy medium between the two. In my opinion, paragraph composer could use
    some major improvements before it's ready for serious typesetting of text.

  body: "Losing control? I see it as 'having less to worry about'. Yeah, if you are
    editing a book, it's irritating InDesign tries to make the very best of it with
    the word/letter spacing and hyphenation constraints you impose on it. Fortunately,
    Adobe foresaw that, so just select the Single Line composer to do your own thinking.\r\n\r\nKen:
    awww, do you <em>really</em> favour manual line breaks (meaning: \"I want a line
    break HERE\") over No Break (meaning: \"I want this word/these words to be unbroken\")?
    I assigned a shortcut to No Break and apply it at will whenever I see something
    I don't like. For the rest, I let ID decide.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps that 900-page book
    has pages-long single paragraphs as well :-) that'd help a lot."

    am doing the index now. Suffice it to say, InDesign CS3's indexing capability
