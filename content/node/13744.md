body: 'I designed an Armenian OTF font with some features, but when I use it in InDesign
  CS ME (Middle Eastern version), that also supports Arabic, the features I designed
  go berserk. I have ligatures: mn vn, and an ordinal rt. The mn ligature works, but
  the vn does not work. The rt ordinal work when you type mi and not rt. The features
  work fine in the non-ME version, so we can say that the problem is caused by the
  program not the font. Still there is the possibility that I can fix the problem
  within the font features, but I don''t know how. Can anyone help?'
