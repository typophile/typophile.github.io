  body: "The first two of my suggestions are digital versions of Al Eliott's Balladeer
    (Headliners, 1975). Luc Devroye notes that it was revived by Fontshop as Ballantines
    Script, by SoftMaker as Ballantines Serial, by Elsner and Flake as Ballantines
    Script, by Ralph M. Unger as Carla Pro, by Castcraft as OPTI Dianna Script Agency,
    and by Dan X. Solo as Dianna. So plenty of choice if you go with this design.\r\nDon"
