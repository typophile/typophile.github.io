  customized? Thanks! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/united_6526.gif]

  body: "This font is based on Cochin Bold. The Small caps are artificial.\r\n\r\nIt
    looks very bootleg to me.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be official:\r\n\r\n(I think the
    best interpretation of Cochin)\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-oldstyle-205/\r\n\r\nThis
    is somewhat related\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Mantinia\r\n\r\nI could
    be off, but the image you submitted feels like it was based on some font by Matthew
    Carter.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "You\u2019re right! Its a severely bastardized Galliard. Probably Black/Bold
    weight artificially bolded and the older tweaks.\r\n\r\nBut anyway I immediately
    recognized Matthew Carter touches.\r\n\r\nDo you need to rebuild the logo or something?
    Just curious.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks guys. I needed to make a horizontal version of the logotype, and so
    am forced to stay with this version of Galliard. I bought Adobe Galliard Bold,
    and it's close enough. Hopefully in the future I'll be able to redesign this,
    but I doubt it! Thanks again. This is such a cool website.
