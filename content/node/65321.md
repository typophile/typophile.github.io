body: 'Outlines drawn in Illustrator show bottom of feet as intended: a smooth concave
  curve. Outline brought into FontLab, all is well: the curve is still right. On generating
  OT font, however, the curve turns into a kind of wave. When the glyph is set in
  InDesign, there''s the odd wave. But when I convert that glyph to outlines in InDesign,
  the wave converts back to the proper concave curve. PDF attached. Any ideas?'

  body: "It's not a change in the outline, but a problem in the rendering by the Adobe
    apps.\r\nIf you look at the PDF with Acrobat you see the \"wave\", but if you
    look at it with a different app (on OS X, for example, with Preview) you will
    see the proper concave curve."

  body: "I think it's a hinting problem. That could explain the different display
    in Preview and Adobe Reader (OS X Preview ignores hints, Adobe Reader interprets
    them for display). When you convert the font to outlines in InDesign, hinting
    is discarded and the outline looks good again.\r\n\r\nWhat do your hints look
    like in FontLab Studio?"

  body: There was no hinting added to the font, and all three points along the bottom
    of the foot have BCPs in both directions. Also, the "wave" is showing up in InDesign
    as well, not just the PDF. I've added autohinting to test, but the wave is still
    there (this is essentially my first font, so I'll have to read up more on hinting).
    Please keep the suggestions coming...

  body: "@ jason\r\n\r\nWould you post the font, please? (Remove the glyphs except
    from the l. I think the easiest way of removing the outlines is to swap them with
    the mask layer and to globally delete the mask then. At the moment I don\u2019t
    know, if there is a function in FontLab with the help of which you can directly
    remove outlines from more than one character at once.)"

  body: "Of the three points I had along the bottom of the foot, I've removed the
    middle point and the \"wave\" appears to go away. Here is the foot with three
    points, and with two. The latter seems to be rendering fine in InDesign and in
    PDF.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcps_5949.jpg]"

    are snapping\r\nto a grid that's throwing off the curves.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "1000 unit em, generating OTPS font from FontLab. I'm drawing the outlines
    in Illustrator on the 1000 unit grid and, yes, I have everything set to snap to
    that grid. Then I've copied/pasted the glyphs into FontLab and fine-tuned them
    there. Here is a JPG to avoid rendering differences: the top is the outline as
    drawn with three BCPs, the bottom is the same foot as rendered in InDesign using
    the OTPS font.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in my last post, though, removing the middle
    BCP from the feet and top serifs seems to fix the problem, so the font is now
    rendering properly. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wave_5321.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    fact snapping to the wrong\r\nplace when you're bringing them from Illustrator.\r\nAnd
    really, in general, the more that you do stuff\r\nnatively in FontLab the better.
    This could all be\r\nFontLab's fault and not Illustrator's, but still.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
