  body: Looks like a customization from Myriad. The gaps have been created in the
    &#39;e&#39; and the &#39;a&#39; and the top of the &#39;t&#39; has been raised
    and flattened. But I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s Myriad-derived -- that &#39;y&#39;
    is pretty tell-tale. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>
