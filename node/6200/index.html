  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is a first stab at an organic serif. I tried to steer towards the calligraphic: the color is fairly even, but not totally even (which I liked), and I liked the upward angle of the serifs. I tend to hate lc &quot;a&quot;s where the bowl doesn't connect, but I think it's working here with the handlettered feel. I've also softened the intersections to give more of a &quot;wet ink&quot; feel. This may be a problem at small sizes but I'm not planning on setting a novel in it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wasn't really looking at something specific. It's more of a &quot;brain dump&quot; after having absorbed serifs for ages and finally attempting one on my own. Hopefully it is &quot;different.&quot; But it's so hard to tell when you've immersed yourself in it. I'll call it a subconscious revival, working name Cuillere. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your thoughts and suggestions desired. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More to follow. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After previewing, it looks like the f could use more weight in the stem.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll take a look at the  &quot;u.&quot; I guess if nothing else, designing a face of a certain style makes me appreciate that style even more, and notice the nuances that differentiate similar fonts.

What genre are we talking about? And what are some exellent examples in this genre? Honest questions - see my first post.

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps we should put it in the font identification forum and figure out what it is :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with you both. It wouldn't stand up to abuse at 10 point for a few hundred pages. Too light and too delicate for that. So this incarnation is for display purposes. Still curious though, is there a name for something like this?

I will look into that. A great example of that is Pill Gothic in these forums. You see the a and the g and say, hmm this is excellent and different than anything i've seen. The rest of the set shoots pretty straight. I think this will make a font sell, but i'm not sure it's enduring.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When the old guys did come up with a good idea, it wasn't about spicing up a letter. It was about shaking up the whole alphabet. In the mean time I will settle for spicing up a letter :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aaron, good point about carrying the flare/added weight in the leftmost stem throughout. As mentioned in the original post the overall color is intentionally un-even since I was going for more of a hand lettered feel. I was thinking the first stroke of a drawn character is usually slightly heavier due to a more loaded pen. As I &quot;handlettered&quot; this digitally (not copying parts), the thinking didn't get into all the characters consistantly. Hmmm, I'll have to look back at this &quot;first stroke&quot; idea. If it makes any sense at all :-) I probably need to weight up right side of  the a, the left of the u, the r, the f, and possibly the diagonal spine of the s. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, it is likely of German influence. I was recently introduced to the lettering/calligraphy work of Werner Schneider. I bet that's where the a came from. Below is a link to classical caps based on his calligraphy work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.tiro.com/aen_mn.html">http://www.tiro.com/aen_mn.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW.

And don't get lost in the historical reference spaghetti, the style has strength and someone said it correctly, flair. It reminds me a bit of Arrus BT but still it's not quite the same thing, it is just plain distinctive.
