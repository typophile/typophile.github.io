    Bold Extended #2</a>' for \"Triumph\" and \"TR5 PI\" ... ?\r\n\r\n'<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bank+gothic\">Bank
    Gothic</a>' is close for \"Overdrive\" but not quite (see length of middle stroke
    on the 'E').\r\n\r\nCan anyone else get closer?"

    are <em>meant to be</em> the same typeface. They're just smooshed/stretched a
    bit to fit their respective spaces, I think. Or it was distortion created in production.
    \"Overdrive\" is certainly different, though."

    (though with annoying reflections):\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1968_triumph_tr5_pi_cabriolet_08_m.jpg]\r\n\r\n(From
    <a href=\"http://www.allsportauto.com/photoautre4/triumph/tr5/1968_triumph_tr5_pi_cabriolet_08_m.jpg\">www.allsportsauto.com</a>)\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing
    this, I'm certain \"Overdrive\" is Bank Gothic. The 'E' actually does have the
    shorter stroke in the middle. \r\n\r\nI'm pretty confident on Eurostile for the
    rest, also."
