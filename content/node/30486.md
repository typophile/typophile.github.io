  everything, but classy. I suggested Garamond and showed them a few different versions
  that I own, including the 2 Adobe Garamonds, an \"Original\" Garamond, and one other
  that I don't remember. They loved the Premier Pro from Adobe, but they really can't
  afford the $280.00 for Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic for six computers.
  \r\n\r\nSo, what is your best recommendation?"

    others at Adobe)

  body: "For classy, I always think Goudy. And it works well in just two weights with
    two italic counterparts.\r\n\r\nDan - you may want to see if there is a Bitstream
    CD or a URW CD on sale... sometimes you can get their whole library for under
    200 to 300 bucks - depending on the sale. BItstream fonts may be a little wider,
    and URW used a different kind of font program (I think it was called Icarus) but...
    they really did do excellent drawing and wonderful kerning for their fonts. And
    they are both considered, um, \"real.\" I believe they are licensed for up to
    5 computers - but please, do not take my word on that\u2014have it verified."

  body: 'This might be heresy, but I don''t really like Goudy all that much. At least,
    from most of what I''ve seen. Things just seem, I dunno, sloppy. Like things weren''t
    really drawn out consistently, very loosely. Not the spacing, just the letterforms
    themselves. Maybe it''s a taste thing. '

  body: "You must be looking at Adobe's and Bitstream's Goudy.\r\nTake a look at URWs...the
    letters fit.\r\nAnd I adore the punctuation on Goudy.\r\n\r\nNot heresy, nicest
    thing about type, we all have opinions, loves and hates.\r\n\r\nI knew one art
    director who hated ITC Eras. Use to say, almost daily, that it is neither gothic
    nor italic. It just leans there. He also would tell me that he would put his own
    personal hatred aside and if the typeface worked with the job, he'd use it. I
    once showed him ITC Eras obliqued another 6 degrees, and when it ever came up
    that he would be using that face (which I think happened once since its release)
    it was used with the further oblique to make it look italicized.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    it takes all kinds to make this world what it is. And if we all like the same
    exact thing\u2014yikes, from a design point, it would be pretty boring.\r\n\r\nI
    think this is when we also thank Toulouse Lautrec for insisting his local printer
    use color on the press. Otherwise, we'd all still be printing in black & white
    today!"
