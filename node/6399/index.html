Here is another face I've been playing around with. I am experimenting a little bit with process here. I think to be good one has to master the medium (or at least learn to work with it). For ex. while the stone has a lot to do with what the letters on the trajan column look like, the masons were in control of what was going on. My medium, in this case the bezier curve, often masters me. (how many clunky s's do we need to do before we can get it right?) That being the case, I decided to do a face without using any geometric crutches (circles, squares, etc.) or duplicating any parts of letters. It's still a sketch right now, and is just a lineale (sp?). <br> <br>Some of the letters are still pretty lumpy. I'm trying to decide where the roughness is working and where I need to apply a little more polish. I'm torn on the Q. It could be really cool or completely off. (it could be a bit less lop sided for sure, but is the tounge working or not?).</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> Ok. I've decided the Q is nasty ugly. Try to ignore it. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Christian, <br> <br>Don't let this one sit on the shelf like all your <br>other beauties that taunted us once and we never <br>see again. <br> <br>There is great potential here. The replication of <br>glyph parts has been done. Adding a human, <br>organic, hand drawn touch to a text font isn't <br>often done - and when it is done, it rarely works. <br>When it works, it's usually a design based in <br>calligraphy (Zapf) or brush forms. <br> <br>Beezer is something new. It reveals clearly the use <br>of computer-based tools, but the human touch is still <br>evident. I'm interested to see how the quirks affect <br>the font at small sizes (Flash doesn't exactly allow a <br>good view of tiny type). I'd also love to see more of <br>the Brush style. <br> <br>My favorite glyphs: "a","g","l" <br>Glyphs that make me extra glad: "a","g" of Bold Study <br>The glyph that makes me sad (and might benefit <br>from a more conservative approach): "G" <br> <br>I think those letters with more gradual curves work <br>best. The sudden kinks of the "G", "K" "R" and "Q" <br>(oops, was I supposed to ignore that?) are <br>distracting and mar an otherwise clean design. <br> <br>Focusing on gentle curves still leaves room for your <br>hand-massaged expirimentation and I think it works <br>great on those glyphs I mentioned. <br> <br>Noting the method and the preview sample, I predict <br>the Bold style will be the star of this family. <br> <br>Stephen </div>

<div class=commentbody> Wow, something really new. Many many others have tried to introduce/adopt such iconoclasm in type design, but 99% have failed. <br> <br>Christian, I think you're really onto something here. Those sporadic but tempered quirks in an otherwise docile <br>design really work, to my surprise. Maybe put a spin on the UC "Y" as well? But it would have to be non-calligraphic. <br> <br>It seems to me that the biggest difficulty in such an unorthodox design is to avoid over-rationalization, and trust your instincts. But at the same time don't fall into the "artiste" trap that renders a font unusable. <br> <br>Anyway, go all the way with this! <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Yes, the kinks might be kind of gimicky. I'm not sure if they don't add some character, though. I might try making the curves a little more subtle. It all started with the lc f, who's shoulder ended up a straight line (a happy accident). I wanted to apply that same feeling to some other characters, hence the lc a, the uc G and even the Q (which has grown on me over the past few hours, though it will definitely be refined). <br> <br>Oh, I thought I'd explain the name. I had a high school teacher who (while she explained Aldus Freehand) thought bezier curves were called "beezers". </div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, In the spirit of "S" research, I offer the following specimens. I took three of my preferred sans serif typefaces, namely Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk, Trade Gothic, and HTF Knockout. Note their differences in construction. I found it particularly interesting to note that Hoefler's bezier handles appear at right angles and both sides of the handles are the same length. <br> <br>I asked him about this and he mentioned that while it worked for this particular specimen, a rectilinear approach is sharply at odds with letters that are either wide or heavy, as seen in some of the heavier faces of Knockout. <br> <br>The specimens follow: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/484.gif alt=akzidenz> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/485.gif alt=trade><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/486.gif alt=knockout></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Christian. <br> <br>Here comes a shotgun blast of thoughts. <br>Much prefer the extended version at this point (for some reason I can't put my finger on) <br> <br>You've got to love the gj combo in german! <br> <br>In the regular width: <br>m: What up with the assymetry in width between the legs? <br>I vs l: That's capital *eye* versus lowercase *el*. They are quite similar (you're not alone here!) At one point in the french there is the word Il. Looks totally weird. Of course it's a weird word. <br>x: the / stroke looks ok. The \ looks like it could use a more vertical stance. <br>E: I'd extend the middle bar. That's just me. <br></div>
