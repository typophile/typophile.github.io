  The text is in a formalised, presumably engraved version of S\xFCtterlin script,
  which I thought my interest typophiles.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/S\xFCtterlin_5146.png]"

  body: Thanks, Andreas. It's sort of a disturbing image for a doctor to have as a
    bookplate.

  body: Thank you for sharing this, both the image and text are very striking. The
    image feels like William Blake has depicted death as a masked wrestler, both wonderful
    and utterly bizarre!

    is interesting, and weird. Any chance that you could add this to the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/kurrentschrift/\">Kurrentschrift
    group</a> that Nina and me started on Flickr?\r\n\r\nFor those who want to learn
    more about Mathilde Ludendorff and her Weltbild, there is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathilde_Ludendorff\">Wikipedia
    entry</a> about her."

  body: "Thanks for the Wikipedia link, Florian.\r\n\r\n<em>She believed that the
    Dalai Lama was controlling the Jews in their supposed attempts to destroy Germany
    through Marxism, Roman Catholicism, capitalism and Freemasonry.</em>\r\n\r\nYikes!
    As far as metaconspiracies go, that\u2019s hitting all the targets; I reckon you
    only improve on that by saying that the Dalai Lama is an extraterrestrial lizardman.\r\n\r\nNow
    that bookplate image seems even more disturbing. I suppose it represents these
    nefarious forces sapping the life energy of the Volk."
