  see. However, I'm deeply in love with type:) \r\n\r\nDrammen is sort of a starting
  point for my typographic self-education, and I will be glad if you could give me
  some feedback and point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    can you type in some lines of text? The st ligature is very nice!\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: "My own comments, since no one else have posted yet: \r\n\r\nThe alternative
    stylish uc \"A\" seem wrong somehow. Something about the curves. The lc \"r\"
    also leaves a big empty room behind it. I also think maybe the alternative ampersand
    is a bit messy."

  body: "There is a lot of inconsistency between the character widths and serifs.
    Without knowing if that is intentional or not it is hard to comment on.\r\n\r\nThe
    spacing is inconsistant too, which I doubt is intentional.\r\n\r\nI think it's
    also difficult to give feedback on something with such a relatively limited number
    of options. Just keep pushing those pixels until you get something you're happy
    with.\r\n\r\nHere are a few quick suggestions...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DrammenTemp_6626.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if making pixel fonts is the best starting point for a typographic self-education
    :)\r\n"
