  body: "<em>Nice article by Charles McGrath</em>\r\n\r\nVW's \"Think Small\" layout
    was created by Helmut Krone, art director, and the headline was written by Julian
    Koenig.\r\nMcGrath's attribution to Lois is interesting, a result of the passage
    of time and the way that famous names scoop up historical accreditations for the
    famous stuff? Or the way that internet-era research generates factoids? "

  body: "Among the first few Google results for 'VW \"think small\"' is [[http://adage.com/century/campaigns.html|this]],
    which includes this:\r\n\r\n----\r\n<blockquote>First of all, our thanks to Kurt
    Kroner, the man behind the defining example of the greatest advertising campaign
    of the century.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't the copywriter. That was Julian Koenig. Nor was
    he the art director. That was Helmut Krone. Nor was he elsewhere employed by Doyle
    Dane Bernbach, the agency that stormed the confining Bastille of advertising orthodoxy
    to ignite the \"creative revolution.\"\r\n\r\nActually, our hero wasn't in advertising
    at all. Kurt Kroner was the one, among 3,389 Wolfsburg, Germany, assembly plant
    workers, to flag a blemished chrome strip on the glove compartment of a 1961 Volkswagen
    Beetle and reject the vehicle for delivery. Yes, if we are to believe Koenig's
    copy, Herr Kroner gave us the famously failed and fabulously forlorn. . . \"Lemon.\"</blockquote>\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo
    even internet-era research isn't an excuse for this misattribution!  Thanks for
    the catch, Nick.\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "Wow, Nick, great catch! My excuse for missing that one is that I was still
    having my coffee as I read the article this morning...\r\n\r\n[EDIT] And hang
    on, I've looked further into this... George Lois was indeed employed at DDB at
    the time of the Think Small ad... I looked it up in Clive Challis' book on Helmut
    Krone. Lois is quoted as saying, \"We have to sell a Nazi car in a Jewish town.\"
    But the book only mentions Koenig and Krone as the people responsible for \"Think
    Small.\" and \"Lemon.\" (There were many other ads, and the book shows them all.)"
