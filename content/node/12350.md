    Can 2005 this past April and he had one of the best presentations of the whole
    3 days, and his work, from an interactive perspective I think is really good.\r\n\r\nHe
    was saying how this was just sort of a fun project, but it turns out he was making
    a pretty good amount of money from all of the referals fees he was getting from
    Amazon."
