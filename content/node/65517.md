  scripts where all caps would be legible. I'm taking about scripts with swishy swash
  script caps where words in all caps will look terrible anyway. Right sidebearings
  are easy to do because they can be tested against lowercase in words. But what about
  the left?\r\n\r\nIn the past I've used sentence endings to gauge the spacing. For
  example:\r\n\r\nYeah. Apes attacked.\r\n\r\nI adjust the left sidebearing on the
  A so the word space after the period feels right. Whaddya think?"

    all, it would get the same left sidebearing.\r\nAre you sure you wouldn't test
    it against a left margin of text, to see the vertical alignment against next sentences?\r\nAs
    for your example, I think it I would solve it with a kern ...\r\nAlthough swashes
    are, indeed, difficult to space, especially in the middle of a phrase."

    it sounds like it would be more precise than eyeballing the cap''s effect on word
    spaces.'
