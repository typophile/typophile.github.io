    to be Andrich Minerva, an old VGC film font:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andrich-minerva.gif]\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "The sample of Andrich Minerva came from a photo display type catalog from
    around 1980. The font was published by VGC. It was one of the winners of a type
    design contest they held in 1965. I suspect your sample is pre-digital.\r\n\r\nAs
    for similar fonts, it reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=ITC.119123.0.0\">ITC
    Century Light</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=EF.929.0.0\">ITC

    still hope to find the exact typeface in use . The sample\r\n\r\ncomes from a
    modern monthly japanese magazine, using the\r\n\r\nface throughout each issue
    as well as for the title design.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it may be a custom font .
    So I have written the\r\n\r\nArt Director in hopes of learning exactly what typeface
    it is .\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nITC Modern 216 Light is
    a gorgeous typeface in it's own right .\r\n\r\nit has many of the same nuances

  body: "A digital version of Andrich Minerva was released by [[Image Club]] in 1989
    and subsequently revised several times during the early 90s. The face was discontinued
    for quality and consistency reasons in 1998 when Image Club was still part of
    [[Adobe]].\r\n\r\nSince it was discontinued and Agfa not longer distributes the
    family as part of <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/searchresults.htm?st=5&cid=Image+Club\">the
    current Image Club library</a>, the only place that Andrich Minerva is still available
    is on an old copy of the Image Club LetterPress disc. I believe I still have a
    couple of lightly-used copies of this disc, if you are interested in obtaining
    one.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of samples set in Image Club's Andrich Minerva using
    the text from your image. As you can see, the cap 'R' is different and the kerning
    is fairly ugly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andrich1.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andrich2.gif]"
