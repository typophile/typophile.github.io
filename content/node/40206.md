  ID for the lettering used on many US Post Office buildings . . . It is too simple
  to be Bernhard Gothic and Gotham doesn't have the angular tilting at the end of
  the strokes like the Cap E shows . . . I've seen this face on many post offices
  throughout the US but have no idea what it started its life as . . .\r\n\r\nBut
  I'm certain it's not Neutra, Gotham or Bernhard Modern . . . Any ID or history is
  appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/po_3692.jpg]\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart

    in the traditional sense of the term. But Gotham and Neutraface were both modeled
    on existing examples of custom signage such as this. They might be as close as
    you can reasonably expect to get. '

  body: "Those same letters are on the post office near me and many others I have
    seen over the years. Knowing how the government works, my guess would be that
    some point perhaps in the 1950s, a bid request went out for signage letters and
    the low bidder got the job. Although the low crossbar on the H signifies a Neutraface
    model, my guess would be that \"Mr Lowbidder\" had a mixed model of Futura, Neutraface,
    and Kable when he built his moulds to create the signs. There were also some movie
    marquee letters similar to that and maybe someone in that field had the metalurgical
    skills to put together a cheap way to make sign letters for the U.S. Govt. Plenty
    of other government offices including USDA have used the same letters. Probably
    after the initial contract, the post office sent the completed letters out for
    bid to match the originals with the bid and continued doing that over the years.
    The letters could have evolved slightly with each new contractor who succeeded
    \"Mr Lowbidder\" from then on. Your answer probably lies at the bottom of an old
    filing cabinet in the office of a government procurement specialist long since
    dead.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'When I went on one of Paul Shaw''s TDC New York type walks, Paul explained
    that a lot of inscriptions on buildings and buildings signs were based on books
    of alphabets for architects. These were an independent source for lettering, and
    the reason for a similarity in some old signs around New York, signs which were
    the basis or inspiration for Gotham. It may be that some of the same factors are
    involved in the letters you show. '

    to the \"Standard Detail Library for illustrations and dimensional information
    regarding each sign component.\" I can't find a free copy of the SDL on the web;
    it looks like it has to be purchased on [[http://uspscd.com/index.htm|CD]] for
    US$25, which is a little beyond my casual interest level."

  body: "Thanks to all for the input! I would think there has to be a single source
    because no matter where I've gone in the country, I've seen the same lettering
    on the outside of 60s looking post offices.\r\n\r\nI was able to find the Handbook
    but it only featured guidelines on in office display boards and vinyl on windows
    and only referred to the type as block lettering.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed becoming
    a mystery that I hope to find answers to . . . It would seem that having a clear
    path to highway and national park signage that perhaps the most documented national
    institution would also have information about the lettering on the outside of
    their facilities.\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

    of this type and at some point I can only assume in the late 70s or early 80s
    that it was replaced with Helvetica so any books about this lettering on modern
    day post offices wouldn't be helpful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there seems to have
    been a condensed weight that was used on federal and public works buildings .

    from Kabel, in the U.C.\r\n\r\nIs it my eyes, or is the S tipped to the right
    a bit? (The building letters are inconsistent in regard to tilt -- perhaps sloppy
