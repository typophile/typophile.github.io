body: Well, I&#39;m starting the thread then... <BR>Gerald mentioned having a Scandinavian
  get-together, and it&#39;s a good idea, I was getting a bit envious of the Typophiles
  meeting in the US all the time... <BR>So how should we go about it? Any suggestions?

- body: I&#39;m interested. I&#39;m having my coffe now. <BR> <BR>Copenhagen is a
    great city, and I would like to buy one of those funny looking bikes I&#39;ve
    seen there. <BR>If this qualifies as good reasons for having an event in Denmark?
    Well... yes? <BR> <BR>If in Stockholm, well I could always take you to <a href="http://www.svaf.se/morris/index_eng.htm"
    target="_blank">Morris</a>, the typograhic second hand book store right outside
    town, which I&#39;ve never visited, but this would be an excellent reason.  <BR>

  body: Stockholm would work for me. I am easy about where. The ships run from Turku
    straight over there. I like ships. <BR> <BR>All the same, I am easy about where
    ever. Helsinki is beautiful. If that&#39;s the choice so be it? Stockholm sounds
    good to me.  <BR> <BR>Possibly though more people would come to Sweden or Denmark
    than Finland.

  body: Helsinki would be good for me as I&#39;ve never been there. <BR>My place,
    Aarhus &#40;yes, I KNOW what it sounds like...&#41; Would probably be too smallish.
    But really, anywhere.  <BR>I get the impression that Stockholm is crowded with
    Typophiles? And stockholm has heaps of very nice neon signs

  body: Well it certainly couldn&#39;t hurt. I am impressed by the talent in Scandinavia.
    <BR> <BR>I wonder if Jim Rimmer would join us? Mind you, he will think I am going
    nuts. I am forever talking about going somewhere else. It is the nature of this
    beast. That&#39;s why I like boats, it seems more normal to move around in a boat.  But
    land? First of last week I was off to St. Petersburg, then changed my mind and
    decided to buy an apartment in Poland. Turned out it was in the middle of one
    of the world&#39;s largest coal mines. They named two terminal diseases after
    the place. So I decided Bosnia was the place for me. Split, nice coastal town.
    I was wondering if they had Dalmatian dogs there. <BR> <BR>I can not blame it
    on the weather. That&#39;s what boats are good for. Excuses.  <BR> <BR>So this
    would be something to stick around for. Maybe I could gather up some interesting
    material. I am not sure how easy that would be. I have something you would all
    love to see. Or hate to see! Either or,
