    for \u2018Converse\u2019: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/bitstream_cooper_medium_ot/?sample_text=CONVERSE%20ALL%20STAR&sample_size=32\">Cooper
    Medium</a>.\r\nLooking at the details (top of \u2018A\u2019, leg of \u2018R\u2019,
    serifs on \u2018E\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019) and not at the overall appearance,
    I\u2019d say <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/memphis_medium/\">Memphis</a>
    is quite close.\r\n"
