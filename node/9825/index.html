  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Martin, <BR>Adobe also offers an up-front payment, but I think it just covers your sales upto that amount (you only get more money if the royalties from sales surpass that amount). <BR> <BR>But in any case, you're right about the money aspect: there's almost none of it in retail, and to make a living (and I don't mean being a hermit in a barrel) you have to do many years of very high-quality custom work. And even then, you can never catch the Concorde. So, in the end, it's really a labor of love. And I mean that in the best possible way. I have bills too, but I always try to remember that they're evil. <BR> <BR>BTW, Stephen, is the Bitstream deal perpetual? If so, $2000 is way too low, unless the royalties are pretty high. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant! <BR>I must admit, I did my research on font publisher's payments a few years ago when I was submitting designs. (I was only successfull once - selling Eastwood to ITC: <A HREF="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=1X7VX1BE6C8S9KPC544DAL9CEE500439&amp;sku=ITC2126" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=1X7VX1BE6C8S9KPC544DAL9CEE500439&amp;amp;sku=ITC2126">http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=1X7VX1BE6C8S9KPC544DAL9CEE500439&amp;amp;sku=ITC2126</a></A>) (If anyone wants to know the story of the font, how long it took to make and how much money it has made so far then by all means email me.) <BR>Perhaps I had, by then, learnt to attune my design submissions to ITC's sensibilities. But also, by that time I was tired of my work falling on deaf ears - so to speak - and I gave up.  <BR>If I could come out with a new font once a month then $2500 or $2000 might be attractive. We all know though that this work rate is unrealistic.  <BR>Also, like every other type designer who ever lived I was self-taught and had to learn everything the hard way, including the commercial side of the profession. Unfortunately I found that all too often, other type designers were simply coy about the commercial aspect of their work and would never get into conversations on the nitty gritty details about how much they were paid for particular fonts and how long the work took. This secrecy seems to continue today, and it remains a mystery to me how online font publishers such as Chank, Larabie et al make enough money to justify the work. I'm quite certain that font design is subsidized by the other professional work such graphic designers do, and is not really a viable economic concern in and of itself. <BR>Sorry that the discussion has gone off topic. I'm new to this forum and just took the opportunity to bring up this subject.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, every case is different, and people mean different things by &quot;living&quot; in &quot;earn a living&quot;&hellip; But I think you've hit the nail on the head about &quot;subsidizing&quot;: Chank for example sells paintings on e-bay for a lot of money. In my case, I'm a Macromedia Director developer, and even with the crappy economy my de facto hourly rate (as opposed to the rate I quote my clients) is pretty high. Lastly, about secrecy: there's still a lot of it, but all indications are that it's much better now than in the olden days. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant! - You're right. I think these designers are effectively their own &quot;patrons&quot; or &quot;sponsors&quot;. They have a real income from other sources which subsidizes the labor of love that is type design.  <BR>The number of type designers in the world that make enough money to call it their sole profession (that's not the best definition, but hopefully you understand what I mean) is probably less than twenty. (And if we put our heads together we could probably come up with a list of exactly who those people are.)  <BR>I would be willing to bet that they can only say that because they are the sort of elite graphic designer who gets commisioned for a new font for a magazine or newspaper - NOT because they make so much money on retail sales of their fonts. <BR>(By the way, I am not referring to lettering artists. Strictly designers of fonts available to buy retail.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This can get interesting. But let's clarify <BR>things a bit. Am I correct in assuming that: <BR> <BR>1. The List contains those who make *most* of their living from their own type designs (not lettering, not anything else), be it custom or retail. (I think we can all agree that virtually nobody can survive on just retail). <BR>2. Fame has nothing to do with it. <BR> <BR>If so, Black and Spiekermann I don't think are on there. Zapf is hard to tell these days. Licko is probably that side of the border (she was commissioned -using the term somewhat loosely- for Journal, I think). Shinn is unlikely (as much as I like his stuff). Unger is a strong contender (but note that he teaches). Tankard definitely. Quay I don't think. Also, Miles Newlyn might be a possibility, but I don't know what he's up to lately. And Tobias Frere-Jones is probably in there. David Berlow might be, if he doesn't make too much money outside his own type designs. And don't forget the Dutch Twins (even though they bend the definition of &quot;type&quot; - good for them). <BR> <BR>BTW, another great on-line source for designers (and others in related fields) is: <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Person" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Person">http://www.myfonts.com/Person</a></A> <BR>You can also search by &quot;Activity&quot;, like: <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Activity1.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Activity1.html">http://www.myfonts.com/Activity1.html</a></A> <BR> <BR>So here's my &quot;cut&quot;: <BR> <BR>Matthew Carter <BR>Tobias Frere-Jones <BR>Jonathan Hoefler <BR>Jean-François Porchez <BR>Jeremy Tankard <BR>Erik van Blokland <BR>Just van Rossum <BR>Gerard Unger <BR> <BR>Sorry for not really growing it&hellip;  :-/ <BR>If we're lucky, I'm wrong. Plus I'm sure <BR>there are some smaller names we're <BR>missing, like maybe Frantisek Storm? <BR> <BR>So, Stephen, it's looking like 10 is a *great* estimate! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess you'd have to be a typographic news junkie to know the current standing of any one of these people.  <BR>Frere-Jones is high profile due to being the most prolific designer at Font Bureau - I think. Maybe he does commissions too. So there's a tentative yes. <BR>Zapf at, what is it, 85 could still walk into most any big corporation and they'd hire him as a  consultant. But I think I agree that perhaps he isn't that active compared to the younger professionals on this list. <BR>Licko's reputation seems to rest as much on her other work and that of her partner, Rudy VanderLans as her type work.  <BR>I don't believe Tankard should be on the list. I think his case needs to be made.  <BR>The Dutch twins I think shouldn't be there as they most probably make a fortune as the hottest graphic designers over there, doing stuff for tv etc. I'm sure their font design work doesn't earn that much. <BR>Unger and Carter are automatically on the list.  <BR>Porchez is probably the Jonathan Hoefler of France. <BR>Roger Black - yes - what have you done for me lately? But he does have an impressive track record. That's why I first put him in. <BR> <BR>I think we can only get there by discussion and consensus. <BR> <BR>Please throw your 2¢ in&hellip;</div>

Who's to say these folks could or could not  <BR>make a living solely from their own type designs? <BR> <BR>I suppose the original goal was to decide how good <BR>you have to be or how rare it is to make a decent <BR>living designing type. Which category of list brings us <BR>closest to that goal? <BR> <BR>Stephen</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought we were talking about individuals and not firms.  <BR>Clearly there are less than 20 individuals (that we know about) who make enough money to call type design their sole profession. So the point has been made about the commercial (non)viability of the field. <BR> <BR>In which case I think I'll contribute to the nit-picking: <BR> <BR>I can't see any fonts at Wolff Olins. And it's a firm, not an individual. <BR> <BR>At Dalton Maag they obviously do a lot of custom font work. Bruno Maag is the owner, but is he the individual responsible for all those fonts? So without knowing the details I'd put DM down as a firm and not an individual. <BR> <BR>I didn't know Hoefler and Jones worked together. But shouldn't Hoefler remain on the list seeing as he seems to be very active in high-profile custom font design?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen: <BR>I think we shouldn't go hypothetical - it's too distracting. As for the &quot;corporation&quot; aspect you bring up, that's definitely something to consider, but only case-by-case. I have to agree with Martin, and restate that -to me at least- the most useful question to [try to] answer here is: who makes most of their living from sales of their own designs? In the case of FB, it's difficult to say who gets how much of what (I'm sure some of you know, though); in the case of Emigre, it's clearer (see below); and in the case of HTF, although it's getting less clear, it's still relatively very clear: Hoefler's library is mostly his - he's the one who worked on  the bulk of the designs, and he's the one who gets most of the cash. TFJ is his partner now (but an equal partner?), so that makes it trickier, but I don't think HTF is really a &quot;font house&quot;, so I suspect TFJ gets most of the money from his own designs. Insiders please correct me if I'm wrong. <BR> <BR>Joe: <BR>In the case of Emigre, I have to ask: fonts designed by *whom*? In the past three years Licko has designed one new font family. And surely RvL doesn't live off of Suburban&hellip; Like most font houses, Emigre gives between 10-20% royalties to its designers, and the rest could be enough to make a living (although less and less with each passing day), but to me that's really beside the point: we're talking about investing time designing type, not leveraging a powerful brand to profit from the design work of others, as smart as that is (or at least used to be). <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
