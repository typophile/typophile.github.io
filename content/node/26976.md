body: This is a really good spot, I have enjoyed the tips for several months.  Now
  I have a question, I hope some of you can help.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using Windows,
  and TypeTool 2.0.  I want to use ScanFont 3.0, but is this compatible with TT2?  Also,
  is ScanFont an acceptible tracing and modification program &#40;as opposed to Adobe
  Illustrator&#41;?  And, I notice that ScanFont only does autotrace, but everything
  I&#39;ve learned tells me that manual tracing is the only REAL method &#40;has ScanFont
  perfected the act of autotracing as to deem it of professional usability?&#41;  Thanks
  everyone.
