  good old days in the newspaper industry. - in the days before the humble Mac or
  PC, back in the days of hand and machine setting type from hot lead. \r\n\r\nHe
  then proceeded to produce from a shelf in his office an old GALLEY which he had
  kept from a past life containing hot metal type.\r\n\r\nAs a designer who has grown
  up with computer technology, I was fascinated by this piece of history so I had
  to ask if I could take some shots of it...\r\n\r\nHere are a some of them...enjoy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_5601.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font02_4367.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mail01_3571.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mail02_3512.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"
