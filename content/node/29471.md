body: "I recently interviewed to become involved with a small publisher who has a
  series of about 200 hundred books. His position is somewhat interesting as the last
  time any of his books were prodcued, printing was mainly still film based. Now,
  he is in the position of needing to have the books transcribed into a text document,
  at which point he is hiring typesetters to flow and format them into a layout document.
  Since the majority of the books are in need of an updated look, and he has no real
  format (other than a standard size for all the books), he is open to suggestions
  and moderate redesigns.\r\n\r\nMy uncertainty here is based on whom needs to retain
  a license for the use of the typefaces that are featured in the book.\r\n\r\nIt
  would seem to me that the publisher would in fact need to purchase a license of
  whatever fonts I decide to use for his projects based on the fact that he is the
  one prodcuing them in their print based form. This would mean that I would simply
  keep an inventory of typefaces used, and add them to an itemized invoice, while
  also turning over the EULA and digital font files to him in the end. \r\n\r\nIs
  this the correct way to conduct business for this type of project with respect to
  the intellectual property of fonts?"

    or freelance?

  body: "Yeah, this is what I thought. I will already have my own personal copies
    of whatever faces I will be using, and I will just let him know that he will need
    to purchase his own license for publishing.\r\n\r\nps. it's an off-site freelance
    gig, so I will be working on this stuff from home."

  body: "While the idea of you licensing the typefaces and then transferring them
    upon completion is good, it has its problems. What if it is finished but then
    they just want one more change and it is large enough that they'd rather have
    you do it than their production staff?\r\n\r\nI'd suggest you license the typefaces
    for yourself. Figure into the contract some information about them also having
    to license the typefaces and give them the information they need upon completion
    so that they can license them.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with license transferability
    is many foundries do not allow for this and so you are limiting your choices."

  body: Question? Are EULAs actually legally binding contracts, since no one, licensee
    or licenser actually signs them, or do they function with more the legal status
    of "prior notice," since they are forced on the "buyer" in point of sale? Also,
    how enforceable are they? Any examples?

  body: "<strong>This is a guess as I'm not a lawyer.</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe lawyers
    look at the EULA as a legally binding contract. \r\n\r\nI think the use of the
    word, \"forced,\" is a little over-the-top, don't you? If the person licensing
    the software (fonts or otherwise) read the EULA and not agree to it, they can
    always choose not to license the software."

  body: I would have to say (although i am not a lawyer either) that an EULA is a
    form of an "express contract" or one that may not be as formal as a written/signed
    contract, however, in the eyes of the law, it is assumed to be just as binding.
    I imagine this will vary from state to state, but from the information i learned
    from the pre-law class that I once took, a contract doesn't have to be singed
    physically to still be enforceable by law. It merely needs to exist, and be presented
    to the licensee at the time of purchase or before any final sale is made.
