  by Daalton Maag. I happened across it recently and find it quite attractive. What
  do other Typophiles think? <BR> <BR> -t

  body: Tim - I have never used Interface so I can&#39;t really give a proper opinion
    on it.  <BR> <BR>However I have used Bruno Maag a few times in the past &#40;London
    Eye, FIBA etc&#41; - they are professional and come highly recommended.

  body: InterFace is absolutely beautiful. The hinting on the TrueType is superb and
    it looks first class on-screen. <BR> <BR>I use InterFace Regular throughout my
    portfolio site, Leftofsix. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.leftofsix.com" target="_blank">www.leftofsix.com</a>

  body: Hi Colin, <BR> <BR>You have a very website. I like your music. Why is it that
    graphic designers always are interested in electronic music? <BR>My collegue makes
    also his own music under the name Ballet Mechanique. We both like the same kind
    of intelligent techno. <BR> <BR>Keep up the great work. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Ren
