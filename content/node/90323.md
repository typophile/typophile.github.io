  the drawing and digitizing of an alphabet of sans serif roman capital letters based
  on examples from the second century BCE. Stone will show different approaches to
  designing letters that will reveal their underlying structures and how they relate
  to modern sans serif forms. \r\n\r\nCarl Montford | <strong>2-day Workshop | <em>Plants

  home three treasures from this workshop. First, you\u2018ll have a floral wood engraving
  that you carved, based on 15th century herbal books. You\u2018ll also have a print
  of your illustration with its accompanying handset-type description, made on a vintage
  Reliance iron handpress. Finally, we\u2018ll give you an illustrated booklet about
  the restoration of the Reliance, showing how design ingenuity and a passion for
  making beautiful things created a gem of a refurbished press.\r\n\r\nMore information
