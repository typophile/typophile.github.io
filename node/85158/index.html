  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey guys, got a new project I&rsquo;m noodling on just for fun. I&rsquo;m going to give a brief summary and then lead you through the process. I ask you if the concept is solid, and just need some reaffirmation that my head is screwed on straight. I also need your expert eyes for some final tweaks and refinements.</p>
<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>Ok&hellip; so a buddy of mine is kind off a new age hippy dippy sort, and challenged me to come up with a company for him to sell these things called &lsquo;binaural beats&rsquo;. A Binaural Beat is created by playing two different frequencies, and when you hear them they make a rhythm — think dial tone. The idea behind these is that if you play different frequencies in each ear what your mind interprets in the middle will take you to a different state of mind, i.e: relaxed, meditative, or energized.</p>
<p>To me it&rsquo;s snake oil - but i still thought I&rsquo;d have a fun time branding snake oil for those co-op grocery granola yuppie yoga sort.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>First came up with the name Auralab - aural lab, aura lab&hellip;. <em>aura</em>lab&hellip; I liked it because it gives the brand legs incase he wanted to make things like yoga mats or something. I also liked the combination of the loosy goosey &lsquo;aura&rsquo; and the scientific &lsquo;lab&rsquo;</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_01_4001.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When I started drawing the type I took this dichotomy very literally, creating organic cursive like hippy type for aura, and rectilinear structured letters for lab, and then merging the two with a cursive lowercase l&hellip; this was to reflect the idea of two frequencies.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_a_6403.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>But then I started to get interested in the shape created by the a,l&hellip;and i liked the idea of making the a look a bit more &lsquo;ear&rsquo; like. This went on its own little tangent where I started to create a shape that was somewhere between a treble clef and and ampersand. I think this will be a very engaging icon, again sort of communicating that idea of combining frequencies.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_03_3525.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I realized the type was getting too fussy and I simplified it while still maintaining that concept of having <em>aura</em> be italic and lab regular - i also made three different a&rsquo;s with the one in the middle being a love child of the two on either side, again subtly making a nod to that two frequencies being interpreted in the middle thing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Auralab_Typophile_05_4003.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally one last round of refinements made me take out the connecting swoosh between the a and l&hellip;. i thought it looked like a nut sack and couldn&rsquo;t see past it :-P</p>
<p>finally some stencil like cuts in the lab letters created a better rhythm and this is where I netted out with the type.</p>

<p>What do you guys think of <em>aura</em>lab ?</p>

(BTW, I like the al ligature of the pre-stencil version, which would work also as a logo made with the initials of aura and lab).</div>

<p>Here is a higher Res Version of the logotype with some of the guides that I used.
