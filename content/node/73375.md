    as a business loss is derived from the fact that you know better. Your claim is
    that what? Nine thousand font licenses were stolen? That would work if, say, you
    had invoices from each of the transactions and proof that in each case the payment
    was stopped\u2014but even then, you could merely void their license agreements.
    So this specific argument doesn't hold up. You can 'steal' or illegally obtain
    fonts, but I don't see any way to steal font licenses (your product).\r\nYes,
    you have suffered legitimate, real damages, but you are only entitled to redress
    as far as and in the ways you've protected yourself in your EULA, and to the extent
    the law applies.\r\n\r\nVirtue is the only complete solution to this problem."

    curious to know if they manually put the serial number somewhere in the font file

    A foundry would have to spend a fair amount of time and energy generating and
    keeping track of those serial numbers, and even more time tracking them down,
    and yet more time writing strongly worded letters to the offenders (or paying
    a lawyer to do it for them). And in the end, unless they can convince the person
    to buy a license (which might not be worth more than the time they've put into
    tracking the person down), they won't end up any further ahead financially.\r\n\r\nThis

    way of eliminating font piracy will be to overhaul the operating system engine
    that serves fonts to applications to require activation like any other software
    in order to operate on a unique system.\r\n\r\nFor example, Adobe Creative Suite's
    activation process was met with initial resistance (predictable), but has mostly
    become routine and manageable for end users who really need to use the software.
    Efforts to undermine the activation process have met limited success and are out
    of technical reach for the vast majority of users. It has pretty effectively reduced
    piracy of CS.\r\n\r\nHaving the infrastructure to manage such activation systems
    is probably overkill for many small foundries, but it would not take much work
    for someone to create a reasonable server-based PHP/MySQL solution that is affordable
    and secure. Or, multiple foundries could employ a central service through a subscription
    pay system.\r\n\r\nIt is Microsoft and Apple who must ultimately fix this at the

    is ruining the entire \"content industry.\"\r\n\r\n1) You don't steal an apple
    from the market stand because you see the apple's owner, and the owner sees you.
    If there were no one around and you really wanted an apple, wouldn't you at least
    consider taking one?\r\n\r\n2) You know you can multiply apples infinitely, so
    you don't even have to physically take the apple away. You magically duplicate
    it and walk away with a brand new apple, and the farmer will never know. Does
    that feel like hurting him? Not really.\r\n\r\n3) When I buy a newspaper, or a
    CD, it feels like buying an apple: we trade objects for coins. When a newspaper
    website makes me pay 50\xA2 to read an article, I feel ripped off. 50\xA2 may
    be nothing, but I suddenly pay without getting a physical object in return that
    would justify the cost. The fact that the supply of copies is now infinite lowers
    its perceived value to zero. Fonts are <strong>crazy</strong> expensive (unless
    you're a professional who can put them on the clients' bill). (Almost) no one,
    at least not me, will buy a family for more than a couple bucks \"for fun\". Us
    type designers very much overestimate the importance of our work.\r\n\r\n4) Try
    to teach your virtues to your kids, who, like me, grew up in a virtual world,
    where everything happens on screen. It just feels unnatural to us to bring the
    concept of money into this immaterial world. Doesn't mean we don't <em>intellectually</em>
    understand you need money to survive, but 1), 2) and 3) are just so overwhelming.\r\n\r\n50

    that you can't just copy and resell software from another company. \r\n\r\nThere
    have been several law suits against companies for violating font licenses. The
    de facto situation is that private individuals can use pirated fonts privately
    with impunity, but publishers and other companies cannot. \r\n\r\n>its notion
    of \"IP protection\" is radically different than yours. \r\n\r\nYou are being
    presumptuous in thinking you know what my notion of \"IP protection\" is. I don't
    know myself, as I'm not a lawyer, and haven't studied this complex matter. \r\n\r\nI
    do think a few things: 1. if Adobe had lost to SSI instead of winning, and similar
    suits were defeated, it would have hurt the font industry. 2. If you download
    and use my font without paying for it, you are depriving legitimate income to
    both me and Font Bureau, who both worked on it--a lot. It is particularly nasty
    if you make money using the font without ever paying for it.\r\n\r\nMatthew: The
    Font Bureau recently went after NBC for violating a EULA: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/10/font-bureau-clashes-with-nbc-over-font-licensing.ars\r\n\r\nThe
    point is, the vikings (promoters of piracy) don't seem to be aware that while
    private piracy is overlooked, public piracy is not, and this is a commercially
    important fact. \r\n\r\nThere is a difference between IP protection and what is
    known as DRM, which tries to use technology to defeat piracy. Your example of
    Itunes is off the mark, because the music is copyrighted, and there have been
    suits for violation of copyright. If you don't think copyright matters commercially,
    just try and download the Beatles from Itunes. \r\n\r\nYour point about the parties
    accepting the rules of exchange voluntarily is correct, but I think, that if the
    rules were never enforced by government, then the parties would not respect the
    rules. You just have too look at poor countries to see where the rule of law is
    much weaker, and commerce is as a result harmed. Poor countries are poor partly
    because of the lack of rule of law, and particularly the enforcement of contracts.
    This stuff actually matters a lot to the wealth of a country. "

  body: "Interesting discussion here. \r\n\r\nOf course there is the legal side and
    the moral side.\r\n\r\nThe legal side again is in some countries divided in how
    much an EULA is actually worth. I can tell you for Austria (and Germany) that
    an EULA is worth nothing if you are not able to have a look at it before you give
    your consent to a buying contract (=paying). I guess this might be in many EU
    countries, this is why many \"rules\" so not apply. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Sidenote</em>\r\n\r\nOn
    a sidetone, I am always fascinated how vigorously people try to enforce the idea
    behind an EULA and think it is a moral rule to comply. It is not, it is a contract,
    which is only legal if the conditions under it came to happen are making an EULA
    binding. This might be different for every person who buys software (depending
    on country, shopping online/offline, which shop/vendor, etc\u2026). If an EULA
    does not apply, normal law applies. The producer does not establish universally
    applicable rules or even a moral code with an EULA. Particularly I am fascinated
    - as Mac owner - how brainless Mac- and iPhone users defend the \"right\" of Apple
    to decide how to restrict their systems. (Mac OS only on Macs, Jailbreaking),
    while the right comes from the law, as the EULA does not apply, nor from Apple.
    \r\n\r\n<em>Back to topic</em>\r\n\r\nSo the legal side depends if the EULA applies,
    and if not, how are intellectual property rights are protected by domestic law.
    \r\n\r\nSharing among friends and family actually is legal in my country in a
    limited way, I think. That was called \"right for a private copy\". But uploading
    something online in the anonymity of the internet, is not. \r\n\r\nSo even if
    one sticks to the law, legality can be a mixed bag. \r\n\r\nFor the morals, I
    do think that the creators of fonts should be rewarded for every font that is
    actually commercially used, not only those officially sold. So yes, font users
    should pay for their licenses. One should not obtain fonts without permission.\r\n\r\nBUT
    \r\n\r\nThere is no stealing involved. The act of using and obtaining a font without
    permission is not theft to me, it is a breach of market rules and intellectual
    property rights. The IPRs are not stolen, they are broken. I do agree something
    that is virtual can't be stolen, only unlawfully duplicated.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes
    to the MARKET, there is no market with the exchange of free software. There is
    value of labor of the community which created all the code. There is a MARKET
    for services around free software. As well more and more big companies use the
    previous development for their own software, because the quality is just convincing
    and the costs for developing something new can be radically reduced. Thanks to
    the genius GNU license they need to give back their developed code to the public.
    Free software is winning right now especially in the mobile OS market. \r\n\r\nBut
    when I say there is no market with the exchange of free software, then I mean
    that there is no market where a piece of free software is being exchanged for
    a price, which is good. There is anyhow an immense value created by free software,
    by the services around them, and by the possibilities to develop certain products
    they open up for other business. \r\n\r\nBut similar there is no market for shared
    fonts as such, as who shares a font does not get anything in return. Font-sharers
    are actually participating in the normal font market, as they simply do see the
    price higher than the value of a legal license would create for them. Now of course
    that does not say anything about the morals of it. Does it hurt the market? I
    guess it depends. In a market setting where there is one threshold where there
    are people who buy fonts based on the value a legal license has for them (and
    the risk an illegal font includes) and there are people who do not buy them, on
    can only change the ratio between the two fractions by: \r\n(a) introducing new
    differentiations at different price marks\r\n(b) by increasing the quality of
    the official good (increase language support, Open Type functions, special characters,
    etc...)\r\n(c) or by increasing the risk an illegal obtained font poses. \r\n\r\nThe
    first two things are something you guys can do. Thinking about the creation of
    \"amateur versions\" I can imagine here it is hard to find the threshold what
    should be cut, what not, and give it a price tag. Would it make sense? Depends
    on how big the market is. Depends if those people who are font-sharers would be
    convinced enough by the price and feature set to reach into their wallets. Here
    it is hard to say, as some font-sharers maybe will for ideological reasons refuse
    to pay any kind of price?\r\n\r\nAnyhow what Ray said, which is option (b), makes
    a shared version (and I assume a fonts gets shared in the beginning, updates then
    not so much, as for the first version the availability would be higher so the
    update-share would not compete) less attractive to those people who are likely
    to pay: professionals. So improving a font might be a good option.\r\n\r\n(c)
    would be the discussed mall-sheriff politics.\r\n\r\nmy two euro-cents. ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Khaled, you are being paid to produce this software, so that's my second
    category, above. I think that's great. In the font world, as in the rest of software,
    this is a segment of the market. But I fail to see how that is morally superior
    to producing a font essentially without knowing whether it will pay you anything,
    and then having people buy it. \r\n\r\nIn either case you are being supported
    by the market place, either directly or indirectly. Of course the group paying
    you may be government or a non-profit corporation, but I still don't see why this
    is morally superior.\r\n\r\nSo I would ask: is it immoral for a farmer to invest
    and produce an apple, and sell it in the market place, for which you need rule
    of law (the police need to stop thieves from raiding the market)? Is it immoral
    for a designer to produce a font and sell it in the market place, for which you
    need IP protection?\r\n\r\nVery few high quality fonts are free in the sense of
    the free software movement you cite. Most fonts used by computer users are now
    bundled fonts, which cannot legally be shared with those who don't have a license
    for the software they are bundled with, such as Microsoft Office or Windows, or
    one of the Adobe products. So I don't see how you can argue that the 'free software'
    movement will produce all the fonts that people want. \r\n\r\nIn the case of Web
    Fonts, we right now see this moving forward as a test case. Raf Levien, who frequents
    Typophile now and then, has been an advocate of the free software movement, and
    has led Google's effort to put up free web fonts accessible through Google. \r\n\r\nI'm
    sure that will be a piece of the pie. But also FontFont, Adobe, and FontBureau
    and Ascender have got on board with web fonts. If history is any guide a lot of
    those with web sites will find these commercial fonts better for their purposes
    than the free web fonts that Google is supplying. \r\n\r\nThe point is, the market
    place is not in itself immoral, and helps people.\r\n\r\nI think the anger against
    it is misguided. Who am I hurting if design a font on my own time, and offer it
    on the market place, for those who are willing to license it and not share it
    with others who may also want to buy it? \r\n\r\nThey have lots of other options,
    including free ones. The market place helps develop more and often better options.

    useful in the proper context. The reason that it is so reviled is that it\u2019s
    used far too often, and used wrongly, far too often, as well.\r\n\r\nFonts come
    into and go out of fashion and, the more often a font is used, the sooner its
    popularity will wane. The freeloaders who download from file sharing sites aren\u2019t
    potential sales lost: the cheap bastards won\u2019t pay for anything they\u2019re

  body: "The sales losses I was referring to only relate to personal vs commercial
    pricing. Customers were offered two price points. When I checked the domains of
    the personal use buyers, they tended to be design agencies, freelance designers
    or small business owners. Many people use a webmail account when purchasing fonts
    so I couldn't check those. Most of the buyers had unique domains and most were
    design agencies, freelance designers or small business owners. As I said, if I
    visited those sites a months later, I could usually find those works in their
    portfolios . . . so they're not just using them to create lost dog posters.\r\n\r\nI
    didn't want to go into stalker mode and google the webmail addresses, I was just
    trying www.domain.com. Before I checked I would never have guessed that the personal
    use licenses would be so commonly ignored.\r\n\r\nMy wife thinks it's just human
    nature. When there are two identical looking packs of mushrooms at two prices,
    most people automatically grab the cheapest one without thinking. There's also
    less incentive to buy the expensive version. With a personal use license you still
    get fresh fonts, support and free updates.\r\n\r\nI don't have any reason to believe
    that it relates to file sharing. I suspect there were losses because of it because
    those agencies would have probably ponied up the extra $15 to buy the same font.\r\n\r\nMy
    sales are pretty consistent. I don't find that I'm selling less fonts but in the
    last 5 years, I've noticed a change in the types of fonts people are buying. Text
    fonts are in. Serious display fonts are in. Whimsical display fonts are out. Retro
    themed display fonts like <a href=\"http://www.typodermic.com/46.html\">Soap</a>
    used to shoot up the charts like butter. Now they tend to generate zero sales.
    I don't think the change in the market relates to file sharing because people
    were sharing fonts in the Reagan era. Now that fonts are cheaper, have flashier
    storefronts, friendlier licenses and are easier to buy, it probably gives people
    more incentive to purchase. Buying a font in 1993 was probably not as easy as
    buying a font in 2010 so agencies were more likely to seek out a illicit floppies.\r\n\r\nIt
    all works out. Sharing makes you lose some sales, it makes you gain some sales
    and there's sweet f&#117;ck all you can do about it anyway. So relax, make fonts
    and don't fret. If your sales are slow in 2010 it's probably because so many font
    categories are oversaturated."

  body: "Dear Khaled Hosny and Aluminum,\r\n\r\nLet's try two more constructive angles
    on this discussion.\r\n\r\nFirst, can you agree that changes in technology have
    created a problem for typeface designers as well as the obvious benefits?\r\n\r\nIn
    the age of metal type, typeface designers were more certain that those who used
    their typefaces would contribute financially to them so they could make enough
    of a living to continue designing typefaces. This was because acquiring a designer's
    typeface without paying for it was actually quite laborious. Most people who wanted
    to use a designer's typeface would opt for the simpler solution of paying for
    it, thus contributing to the existence of a type-design industry. That is, in
    the age of metal type, both the designers and their customers contributed to their
    being typeface design in the future.\r\n\r\nWith the switch to digital type, typeface
    designers have a big problem. It is now easier for a customer who wants to use
    their type to simply take it and use it without any reciprocity, without contributing
    to the typeface designer's financial ability to go on creating type. As modern
    history has shown over and over, a person can only continue a career for exactly
    as long as it remains financially viable to do so. If people use a typeface designer's
    work without paying for it, they are effectively changing the reciprocity of the
    relationship. They are through their actions saying that they expect typeface
    designers to continue investing in typefaces but that they themselves do not wish
    to invest any longer in there being new typefaces designed. They are changing
    the relationship from symbiosis, in which both participants benefit, to parasitism,
    in which the designer does all the work and the \"sharers\" help themselves to
    all the benefits.\r\n\r\nThe alternative financial models you proposed rely on
    corporations with deep enough pockets who have a financial incentive to prop up
    the typeface-design industry by subsidizing the work they approve of. I don't
    see this as the positive alternative you do, because it takes the decision-making
    about which fonts will exist in the future out of the hands of designers and puts
    it in the hands of corporations. That is, anyone will still be able to design
    whatever they want, but the only ones who will thrive are the ones who cater to
    the financial interests of the corporations. To me and many other people, this
    seems a lot less like a utopia than a dystopia.\r\n\r\nI would much prefer that
    customers and designers drive the marketplace, but that will only work as long
    as their relationship remains a symbiosis, that is, as long as customers are willing
    to be active and helpful participants who give back to the relationship.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, the problem that Typerror, OldNick, and others are trying to describe
    may not fit some definitions of theft, but whatever you choose to call it there
    is a real harm done that will lead to the deterioration of typeface design in
    the future - and that disproportionately hurts the very small, independent typeface
    designers who I would expect a free software advocate to champion.\r\n\r\nI write
    this, by the way, as a veteran software designers who has made his entire career
    writing exclusively free and open-source software for twenty-six years and counting.
    Typeface designs are very different from normal software, so it is dangerous to
    analogize from one to the other to argue that typeface designs should also be
    free. With complex free software you can and must sell the expertise to go along
    with it, but anyone can set a vaguely legible page of text even without expert
    advice, so what can typeface designers sell to support themselves if they are
    supposed to give away all their designs for free? I don't believe your analogy
    to the free-software movement works for typefaces.\r\n\r\nSecond, the other argument
    one can make in discussions about what constitutes stealing is the question of
    need. If I steal an apple because my children are starving, many humane people
    would argue that those exigent circumstances at least partially excuse the crime.
    But does anyone ever NEED to share a typeface? Of course not. There are plenty
    of free typefaces already available. When someone helps themself to one of Typerror's
    typefaces without paying for it, they are engaging in that act needlessly.\r\n\r\nWe
    may argue about the semantics of the act, but whatever kind of injury is done
    by taking someone else's design parasitically - without reciprocity, without giving
    back to support the continuation of the designer's work - that act is entirely
    optional and voluntary. It's unnecessary. There are plenty of ways to look at
    this issue overall, but by this one measure it is a worse kind of injury than
    stealing an apple, not because of how it affects the designer but because of how
    it affects the \"sharer,\" who is engaging not in a reluctant act of desperation
    but in a casual and wholly unnecessary act of parasitism. This measure is not
    arbitrary; it's one of the measures universally considered during sentencing,
    when judges and juries are trying to decide how bad a person someone is, whether
    they are redeemable, whether the crime is excusable. Casual, calculated injuries
    are considered far more worrisome than those done out of need.\r\n\r\nI don't
    think it's good for people to live their lives as passive dependents who take
    without giving back, the way small children have to. We are biologically wired
    to develop out of that infantile psychology (dependence) toward autonomy, first
    toward meeting our needs ourselves without as much help (independence), and then
    toward giving back to the world (interdependence), to paying back the investment
    our parents and communities made in us by paying it forward to our children and
    communities. As we approach those stages, we spend less time asking what we want
    and more time asking what we can do to help create the kind of world we believe
    in, to help shape the future.\r\n\r\nIf we want there to be typeface designers
    in the future, then we need to think about how we can contribute to their work.
    For the nondesigners among us, it seems to me that paying for new typeface designs
    is the simplest way we can do our part to protect the flow of new designs."

    That hasn't changed in the digital age. Look at Adobe, AGFA, Monotype, and Linotype,
    which are big corporations in their own right (I know, they all merged, but even
    before that, they were big). Or look at the Font Bureau library or the Hoefler
    & Frere-Jones library -- many of those fonts originated from custom jobs done
    for corporate clients in the publishing industry. They were not the product of
    designers \"design[ing] whatever they want\". There are foundries whose output
    is more along those lines (e.g. Emigre). I'm glad we have both kinds. But this

    a lot smaller financially and a lot narrower creatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@butterick:\r\n\r\nI would not argue that no one ever stole typefaces before
    the digital age, only that copying a file is several orders of magnitude easier
    than either hauling off a case of metal or meticulously imitating someone else's
    work and casting it to create your own version. Since a digital file the size
    of a font can be copied in seconds, I'm surprised anyone would think it was even
    remotely as easy to \"share\" typeface designs before the digital age, which seems
    to be your argument.\r\n\r\nI also would not argue that anyone has a right to
    make a living off what they did, only that those of us not engaged in that career
    need to consider whether we want typeface designers to make a living. If we want
    there to be doctors, we should probably ensure that it's possible to make a living
    as a doctor; the same applies to typeface designers. The economy isn't just something
    that happens. It's something we make happen through our actions. If we want there
    to be professional typeface designers in the future, then in the present we should
    not personally act in ways that destroy the economic viability of that career.
    As an aside I'm not sure there ever were dedicated professional buggy-whip repairmen;
    the obsolescence metaphor you're alluding to is usually about buggy-whip manufacturers.\r\n\r\nI
    also would not say I didn't want corporations involved in the decisions about
    which typefaces get created, only that I don't want that to be the only economic
    option for typeface designers. I want there to be a thriving market in which anyone
    who is motivated and passionate enough and has the resources - both corporations
    and individuals - can find professional typeface designers to help them create
    new designs. That's why I don't think it's unreasonable to pay for typeface designs,
    why I don't agree with Khaled Hosny when he writes that those designs must necessarily
    be free but that making them free wouldn't destroy the industry because companies
    might later approach the typeface designers and offer to pay them. I don't doubt
    that that has worked for him, but I wouldn't want it to be the only model. If
    we did ban it for ideological reasons, I think as far as the typeface-design industry
    was concerned the results would be dystopic rather than utopic.\r\n\r\nAs for
    my post being emotional, counter-factual, and rosy-hued . . . well, even upon

    this wouldn't be the first time in human history that things seemed different
    to two different people. I'm sure there is much in my post that could be improved
    - for example I should have written that I do support Mr. Hosny's right to create
    free fonts and I'm glad there's an active community supporting and sharing those
    fonts - and I like a good argument as much as the next fellow, but I prefer it
    when people argue with what I actually write."

  body: "Building on Aluminum's argument when he wrote \"Copying files without permission
    isn't the same as stealing a Ferrari and robbing starving kids nor is it the same
    as shiny happy bunnies and rainbows. ;)\" . . .\r\n\r\nI agree that sharing the
    files that define digital typefaces does indeed stand somewhere in between those
    extremes. I also agree that it is too easy in these discussions to polarize, as
    though instead of searching for the truth we are taking sides in a sporting event,
    and when we polarize we distort what we are supposed to be trying to understand.\r\n\r\nTaking
    your request for nuance a little further, stealing a Ferrari is also somewhere
    between robbing starving kids and shiny happy bunnies and rainbows. It also isn't
    neutral, though, like eating lunch or taking a nap. It's bad, but it isn't as
    bad as stealing from the starving kids. Stealing from someone who has a thing,
    likes a thing, and uses a thing, but doesn't actually need that thing is different
    from stealing what people actually need to survive. They're both theft, but they
    aren't the same degree of crime.\r\n\r\nWhen someone mass-produces things based
    on their own original designs, stealing one of their products is different still.
    Specifically, stealing a Ferrari from a Ferrari factory does less damage to the
    factory than stealing a Ferrari from a Ferrari owner does to the owner. It's not
    as bad because the Ferrari factory can make more Ferraris (conditionally - we'll
    come back to this), but the Ferrari owner may not be able to afford another Ferrari,
    or that particular Ferrari may have had special emotional value to them. Either
    way, it's easier for the factory to get another Ferrari than for the owner, because
    the owner can't make Ferraris but the factory can. Using the apple metaphor Khaled
    Hosny alluded to earlier, stealing an apple from a starving child is worse than
    stealing an apple from an adult who'd planned to eat it for lunch, which is worse
    than stealing an apple from an apple orchard. The issue defining this scale is:
    how badly did our victim need that specific thing we took? The more badly they
    needed it, the more damage we've done by helping ourselves to it.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    only a thief will rationalize that committing a lesser crime counts as doing something
    good. Just because an apple orchard has more apples and can more easily replace
    the one we took, that still doesn't make it okay to steal from the orchard, because
    we do a different kind of damage to the orchard that the hungry child and the
    adult don't suffer - they don't have to make their living by selling apples. The
    child should be supported by its parents and community, and the adult by some
    other career, but the apple orchard needs to sell those apples to make enough
    money to keep growing apples. If enough people take the apples instead of pay
    for them, the orchard will go bankrupt, the grower will have to do something else
    for a living, and the land will (usually) be sold off for some other purpose.\r\n\r\nThat
    is, we're talking about two very different kinds of damage here. There is a damage
    that comes from depriving someone of a thing they need or want, and there is a
    different kind of damage that comes from depriving someone of the means to make
    a living. Granting Butterick's argument that no one has a right to make a living
    at what they do, nevertheless when we personally intervene in their lives to reduce
    their ability to make a living, that isn't the abstract forces of history judging
    their career as obsolete - that's us personally hurting them unnecessarily, but
    in a different way than the simple, direct deprivation of taking a thing from
    them. However we try to dress it up, it's economic sabotage.\r\n\r\nOur problem
    in this digital age of typography is that sharing files is so easy that anyone
    can see that taking a copy of a digital file can't possibly count as depriving
    anyone of a thing they had - after all, they still have the file; we just took
    a copy of it. Zeroing out the deprivation damage gives people the rationalization
    they need to help themselves to any font files they can lay their hands on - regardless
    of the other form of damage they are doing, the economic sabotage.\r\n\r\nThis
    is the crux of the moral issue here. It's not enough not to hurt people in one
    obvious way. To be good people, we must refrain from hurting people in any unnecessary
    way.\r\n\r\nThat it's easy to copy the files does not give us moral permission
    to do so; it's also easy to steal candy from children, or to drive away a car
    if someone's left the keys in it. Just because copying a font file doesn't deprive
    them of their copy of the file, that does not give us moral permission to copy
    it; it's also easy to copy trade secrets if someone leaves them on their desk,
    or to copy someone's medical record if you come across it in a hospital, or their
    diary, or their logo or packaging style.\r\n\r\nAside from the legal issues of
    ownership, which clearly are not fully persuasive to some of us, there are moral
    issues of ownership that ought to be. When someone creates a typeface, they have
    more moral rights to that design than we do; they thought of it, they invested
    in it, they made it, they understand it, they care about it, and they want to
    share it with us, and all they ask in return is that we invest in them so they
    can go on making typefaces and that we don't sabotage them economically. If they
    want us to share the files and we do so, then that's free software as defined
    by the Free Software Foundation. If they want us to use the files but not to share
    them but we do anyway, then that's not free software, it's economic sabotage.\r\n\r\nSo
    where does sharing font files without the designer's permission fall on our scale
    of right and wrong?\r\n\r\nIt isn't as bad as taking a thing someone needs, nor
    as bad as taking a thing someone wants, but it's every bit as bad taking a product
    from a producer. Here's why. Even though it's harder for a Ferrari factory to
    produce another Ferrari or for an orchard to produce another apple than it is
    for a foundry to produce another copy of their font files, the economic sabotage
    of stealing a physical object is more restricted, because the person we share
    that stolen car or apple with is only going to use it, whereas some of the people
    we share the stolen font file with will doubtless share it with more people -
    the damage increases over time by increasingly driving down people's willingness
    to invest in the designer since more and more of them have his work for free.
    The increasing damage over time offsets the ease of replacement, so it's about
    on a par as far as the scale of the economic damage goes.\r\n\r\nSharing font
    files without permission is by no means neutral or good. It's bad, not the worst
    thing by far, but definitely a species of economic injury. Like all kinds of injury,
    it creates negative consequences that we suffer whether we want to or not, whether
    we recognize them or not, that result directly from our actions.\r\n\r\nI'm sure
    this could be gauged with more precision and nuance, but at the moment that's
    my most careful take on the moral species of sharing font files without permission.\r\n\r\nFor
    what it's worth. Your milage my vary and all the usual disclaimers and caveats."

    original free fonts, I don't think he has the right or entitlement to prevent
    those who choose to making a living selling fonts from doing so. Most people have
    a sense of honesty and integrity, they would feel guilty about performing acts
    which are either, criminal, unscrupulous, or even just of a dubious nature. What
    Mr Hosny and his ilk are doing is repeatedly giving support to notions that unlawful
    taking or sharing of commercial typefaces is not only normal and expected, but
    ethical and desirable. This is in effect propaganda. As per Joseph Goebbels's,
    \"If you say it loud enough and long enough, people will assume it must be true.\"\r\nThe
    effect on the typically honest person is to progressively dissolve the feeling
    of guilt and make \"acquiring\" typefaces which you have no right to, seem \"normal\"
    or even chic. \r\nDuring the Vietnam War, and I am sure all other wars, there
    were incidents of rape of village women.  There were guys not only doing it but
    rationalizing it as a patriotic duty--after all they were not humans, they were
    just \"Gooks\" and their husbands and brothers were probably \"The Enemy\".  It
    was easy to do and extremely unlikely to bring punishment, therefore, if you could,
    you should. Dehumanizing Vietnamese women or decriminalizing unscrupulous acquisition
    of property not in your ethical domain may seem at opposite ends of the spectrum
    of immoral acts but none the less, they are BOTH immoral and illegal.  All of
    the rationalizing propaganda on earth will not change that fact.  It would be
    truly \"naive\" and self-serving to think otherwise. I am sure Mr Hosny and his
    like-minded band of thieves will respond as usual with either further rationalization
    to refute their criminal behavior or character assassination of those who think
    and speak to the contrary. It is the basic Rush Limbaugh technique--he always
    has the microphone and the airways so repeating the propaganda and dehumanizing

    number of attorneys agree - that something is wrong with our copyright and patent
    laws. The original intent was as you say to protect and encourage creative endeavors,
    but we all know of cases where those laws are instead used to suppress creative
    endeavors - for example buying up the rights to competing innovations and then
    shelving them. It is ironic that these laws can been perverted to do just the
    opposite of what they were intended to do.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it does not follow
    that no one ever uses the laws for their original, intended purpose. On the contrary,
    plenty of creative people use copyright laws to protect their ability to do creative
    work. The use of civil disobedience to challenge unjust laws is perfectly legitimate,
    but only if it is used selectively, against those who are causing the problems.
    Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. broke laws carefully and selectively. If you
    instead always condone sharing files, you are punishing everyone indiscriminately.
    That doesn't count as legitimate civil disobedience because it isn't targeted
    enough.\r\n\r\nJust because our current legal framework is broken, that doesn't
    mean the prior situation was any kind of paradise we ought to be striving to return
    to; it was worse. The laws were passed in the first place because the original,
    unprotected situation in America resulted in widespread theft and deceit that
    led people to wonder why they should ever both creating anything since it was
    only going to be stolen from them, with the thieves taking credit for the invention.
    If all we do is ignore or repeal the copyright and patent laws, we are not replacing
    a bad situation with a good one; we are replacing the current bad situation with
    the original bad one. If we want a good situation, we should accept neither alternative
    and push for something different, a third alternative that will truly protect
    and encourage creativity. I would love to discuss what that might be.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'd like clarification on something you wrote. When you wrote\r\n\r\n\"And nobody

    for yourself but this is a very hard life and you may not be very good at most
    of the things. Otherwise, if you are a very good farmer, you can trade your food
    for someone else\u2019s well made clothes or medicine. In this way, everyone can
    find at least one task of value to others that they excel at and concentrate on
    that alone to be even better and more efficient at doing it. You can trade your
    service or product for something else that you need by exchange. The peoples of
    the world have done this since the beginning of time, some in a very basic way
    and some in a complicated network of more obscure ways (as exist in our modern
    society today). It is more complex that the ancient times and our \u201Cneeds\u201D
    have a fuzzy definition\u2014our \u201Cwants\u201D still exceed our needs, though.
    We therefore have odd professions like Movie Actor\u201D football player, lawyer,
    urologist, school teacher, policeman, structural engineer, and even typeface designer,
    that were unheard of before civilization took place. \r\nThe point is, everyone
    can find a means of support that they are good enough at to be a means of exchange
    for others. It seems I have left out one important category that has existed since
    the beginning of time. The modern day version is much adapted to modern life and
    very adept at his ancient skill\u2014even if the ways and means have greatly evolved.
    The problem is that nobody from outside that group wants anything to do with them
    or certainly not be a party of their trade.  This group of people are the ones
    that produce absolutely nothing of benefit to others, they are like a parasite
    that clings to your intestinal walls and secretly absorbs all of their needs and
    wants from your body with either permission or your request. These are the thieves,
    con men, takers who have nothing to give or to trade. They survive by making other
    people miserable and are proud enough about it to think they are entitled to do
    so under some code which only they have invented to rationalize their existence.\r\nTrue,
    some are less heinous than others and only prey on the greedy or, at best, naive
    hosts to extract their pound of flesh. Still, even the least of them is not a
    contributer, a maker, a doer, a helper, or even an entertainer. Perhaps we should
    just pity their lack of ability to contribute and allow them to continue their
    life-long attachment to our innards and allow them to drink our life\u2019s blood
    until we faint from lack of nourishment. Of course we have to work twice as hard
    so that they not need to work at all, but, that is just the price you pay for
    your fellow man\u2019s self-proclaimed right to continue unabated.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    want to use noncopyrighted software as an expression of that principle, fine.
    But you can't say that principle gives you (or others) a basis to break the law.
    That's just a rationalization.</cite>\r\n\r\nI never said I support breaking law
    (I think I explained that more than once in this thread), what I'm saying is that
    the laws are wrong and need to change, and so I sympathise with file sharers,
    and though for me illegal != unethical, I still don't encourage file sharing for
    many reason, if only because it actually supports proprietary software by making
    it the de facto standard.\r\n\r\nThe original context for that, as it seems to
    have been missed, was the suggestion that school children should be taught that
    file sharing is not sharing but stealing, which is an establishment of pro-copyright
    propaganda which, apparently, I strongly oppose."

    the font for free the more likely it is a person will pay for it.\r\nYes good
    marketing and great quality will affect sales a lot more than policing and hunting
    down illegal download sites, but if the action against piracy is centralized (through
    foundries or retailers) it may prove to be productive and efficient and actually
    return more money than is spent on it. A number of schemes can be executed to
    drive potential users from the pirate websites into the legitimate retailers.
    Like for example flooding the Torrent market with huge torrents of what is seemingly
    great quality fonts and making sure they rank high on Google search and then once
    the huge ZIP file is on your hard drive BOINK it's a bunch of rubbish. They actually
    did that when The Simpsons movie was first released into theaters, all the downloads
    of that movie were rubbish so I gave up. This is only one example.\r\n\r\nI'll
    agree with Khaled that creativity has little to do with Copyright. But Copyright
    is just a fair way to financially compensate the creator. It's not about moral
    rights, it's about financial rights."

  body: "Dear Khaled,\r\n\r\nThank you for the clarification. It reinforces my earlier
    argument that other posters shouldn't be dismissing you as a thief and a pirate,
    because you have a moral code, so there is a basis for discussion. It is too easy
    when people don't understand you to make assumptions about your motivations; after
    they do that, you're fighting an uphill battle to be understood because they will
    filter everything you say or write through their expectations about your motivations.\r\n\r\nThat's
    where the antagonism has been coming from in this thread. As far as I can tell,
    no one on this thread is opposed to the existence of a free-software community.
    They're opposed to having their own software \"liberated\" without their permission
    - and they read your comments as though you were promoting that.\r\n\r\nTo help
    a step further, if you explained more than once on this thread that you don't
    support breaking the law (and I believe you), I and most of the other posters
    missed it. We misunderstood what your wrote and thought that was precisely what
    you support. With that mistake uncovered and removed from the equation, the discussion
    becomes more interesting because we can more clearly explore our real differences
    of opinion instead of responding to our mistaken impressions of each other.\r\n\r\nMore
    later."
