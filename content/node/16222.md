  Auriol, 1863-1938, is the pseudonym of Jean-George Huyot. He was an Art Nouveau
  artist and designer, one of a group who frequented the Chat Noir or Black Cat Cafe
  in the Montmartre district of Paris. He came to Paris in 1883 to be a writer and
  some of his essays were published in Chat Noir. Eug\xE9ne Grasset introduced him
  to typography and book design which led to his designing <em>Les Trente-six Vues
  de la Tour Eiffel</em> in 1902. He worked as an illustrator, writer, and printmaker
  as well as a type designer. He is best known for his Auriol face designed for [[Deberny
  Peignot]]. The letter forms are stencil like and have very organic shapes which
  can be seen as flowers, plants, or bones."
