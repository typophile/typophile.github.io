I don&rsquo;t know that much about hot metal typesetting. In fact, I had the idea yesterday and I began looking for more information today.

<p>The problem is : my business card will include an e-mail address&hellip;</p>
<p>What will happen with the @ character ? This character has been around for many many years before we started using it in e-mail addresses. But was it part of the regular metal letter repertoire ?</p>

<p>The &ldquo;at&rdquo; sign: older fonts tend to have it too high, and
usually too large* to work well for email. Certainly the
easiest solution is to use an &ldquo;at&rdquo; sign from a smaller size,
and lead it on top to lower/fit it. A more sophisticated way
is to go with photopolymer letterpress, which lets you print
virtually anything you can make on your computer (but it

<p>This &lsquo;at&rsquo; starts to appears in the Monotype pattern C (book and news) matrix case. English-standard character set with the &lsquo;per&rsquo; character.

Legros and Grant, Typographical Printing-Surfaces: The Technology and Mechanism of their production. London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1916. pp. 393, 397.</p>
<p>As far as my memory goes it was appearing in largely American sorts at the begining of the last century. It was commonly used in commerce.
(hence the full name of &lsquo;at cost&rsquo;).

<p>hrant, I&rsquo;m not sure i understand your question (english being my second language) Do you mean &ldquo;what is the purpose/concept of using this kind of printing on a business card ?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about putting emphasis on fine details. And a crafted and unique business card would reflect the delicate and sensitive side of the human being. I see business cards like this: it&rsquo;s a little part of someone, given to someone else. It is highly personnal!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the thing to do here would be to take Hrant&rsquo;s suggestion and go with polymer. I say this not only because it removes the issue of finding a metal face with @, but more importantly because of what Hrant has been talking about in terms of distinguishing between affectation and purpose/message.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some extremely effective letterpress business cards and, to my mind, what made them stand out was the combination of old-school detail (quality paper, understated design, solid setting [kerning, etc.], good inking, firm but not killer impression) with new-school technology and design. That is, the easiest way to avoid the impression of preciousness with letterpress is to avoid using the standard faces that everyone who has a press has in hot or cold metal, and the best way to do that is to design &amp; set your copy in polymer with a relatively distinctive digital font. (Unless, of course, you&rsquo;re into cutting, punching and casting your own type.)</p>
<p>This, it seems to me, would best convey your mandate/goal of &ldquo;using an old process to make something new&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Indeed, when you use a digital font (anywhere, not just in letterpress) you either have to choose one with optical scaling for small sizes, or you have to do things like choose a demi weight, track it looser, etc. to get it decent. In metal fonts (except for the really bad ones) this was sort of done inherently.</p>

<p>Is it nostalgia? Yep.
Is it fetishism? Nope.</p>

<p>Desires that are out of the &lsquo;run of the mill&rsquo; must be budgeted for. Several years ago I came across a graphic designer here in New Zealand who was on a similar mission (their own design on their own business card), except that they really, really wanted gravure printing, rather than letterpress. Their reasons for this were all about the craft and quality, although at that time there were still viable letterpress options here. Finally they realised that because there were no longer any &lsquo;jobbing&rsquo; gravure presses in New Zealand, they would have to get the job printed in Australia. Needless to say, this just blew the budget right out of the water&hellip;</p>
<p>Ultimately they settled on a very ordinary offset job on some nice stock and left it at that.</p>
<p>If you are looking for further romanticism about traditional letterpress there is <a href="http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/movies/">this lovely record</a> on Mark Jamra&rsquo;s TypeCulture site, which includes John Kristensens observation that &lsquo;letterpress will die&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But I would listen closely to what Hrant and Jason are telling you about digital photopolymer letterpress. It sounds like for what you want, it&rsquo;s the way to go, as long as your typesetting reflects the medium it&rsquo;s intended for.</p>
<p>Usual setting for @ (whether offset or letterpress); as Hrant says, the @ should be a couple of points smaller than the surrounding text, and baseline shifted so that it optically centres between baseline and x height.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;ve had remarkably good success making photopolymer plates from Boxcar Press (<a href="http://www.boxcarpress.com/">http://www.boxcarpress.com/</a>)  I bought the boxcar base, which is made from machined aluminum and gridded for alignment of the plates which come with a reusable adhesive backing.  The base is a bit of an investment, and I&rsquo;d only recommend it if a) you are going to be doing more of this in the future or b) you need to do something larger than about 5 X 5 (just to retain flatness of the type surface)  The people at Boxcar Press are very helpful and have a section on their site which answers a lot of questions.  The ability to pair digital typography with letterpress printing opens so many interesting avenues.  Good luck</div>

<p>From what I understand, even without a magnetized back or an adhesive-

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can&rsquo;t recall any at sign in metal that was appropriate. We always had to fit a small point size in the line, adjust the baseline, and with, preferably a semi-bold or bold face version to optimize it. Much, much easier with digital baseline and sizing adjustments (and a font-editing program if you need the weight) to make it look appropriate. I think Bringhurst has something to say about the proper fitting of the at sign. As I recall he is at odds with adjusting it to near the x-height. I think this is wrong. Don&rsquo;t have a copy near hand so can&rsquo;t verify his suggestion. Best at sign I have ever seen is the alternate in Journal.</p>

<p>Letterpress still has real value (although not the sensationalistic way it&rsquo;s almost always used today). But actual typographic production in metal is finished: it only has an educational value now (although a huge one), and way too many arbitrary constraints, flaws and anachronisms (like the typical too-high &ldquo;@&quot;).</p>

There are a great many superb digital fonts out there now, and we can always do a better job reviving the metal ones.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You paint with a broad brush.</p>
<p>It may be finished as a means of generating an illustrative greeting card line, or as a strictly commercial endeavor that kowtows to the whims of designers unable to accept the limitations of the process, however, it has a peerless place for a certain class of printing.</p>
<p>There will always be those who respond to finer things, done well with attention to detail, using traditional methods, and those who don&rsquo;t recognize the difference.</p>
<p>For example, one can go to The Bombay Company and buy a plastic and white metal &ldquo;Tiffany&rdquo; lamp. Despite what the sales person tells you, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s actually &ldquo;Tiffany&rdquo; stained glass, thoughtfully designed and hand produced. By the same token, relief printing produced exclusively from plates (&ldquo;platepress&rdquo;) isn&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;letterpress&rdquo;. Yes clearly it&rsquo;s printing. Just not what it purports to be, or you believe it is. But for some, plastic and the illusion of something finer is satisfactory.</p>
<p>With regard to alleged constraints, flaws and anachronisms: black and white photography must be dead too since digital needn&rsquo;t concern itself with pesky silver grain and light sensitive paper and chemicals and whatnot. It&rsquo;s all just so much trouble what with the skills and equipment required.</p>
<p>Why learn to play the violin when you can make the same sounds with a synthysizer? No one will know the difference on playback. . .</p>
<p>The &ldquo;too high&rdquo; @ sign is only an issue in the hands of the unskilled or unaware. I&rsquo;ve not had that problem. Generally speaking: 2pt sizes smaller and shim with brass and copper thins to base align the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. Simple.</p>
<p>I scrolled down to your card. I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re happy with it. It&rsquo;s not my style.</p>
