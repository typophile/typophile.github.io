  while designing a logo for one of my old bands, The Royal We. Although I've rarely
  seen this particular font used, I think that it's fluid movement and interesting
  design characteristics are very appealing to the eye and it is very attention grabbing.
  Since the moment I first used the font, it has become a favorite of mine whenever
  designing something creative with text. \r\n\r\nGrowing up in New Orleans, I think
  that text has played a very important role in the way I visualize certain things.
  When I thing of places like Magazine or Oak street I thing of the old blue and white
  box lettering that label the street corners. It always amazed me that people actually
  took the time with each of those individual tiles to create something so beautiful,
  reminding me that at one point someone actually cared about something. \r\n\r\nAnother
  important thing about New Orleans is it's restraunts. They take up every corner
  of every block, of every neighborhood. A person can easily tell by the type used
  in their logo design what type of place it is as far as atmosphere and what type
  of food they might serve. These are the things that grab my attention and make want
  to further investigate what lies behind the logo.  "

  body: I agree with you Louie about the type of font that is used for restaurants
    do tell you exactly how classy they are and what the price range would be. Font
    and design in general is a big part of the New Orleans culture, so I can understand
    why you are big on design as well as text. Is this the reason you chose to be
    a graphic designer?

  body: "I've always loved to create things. Ever since I was a kid, I tore apart
    my mother's house making rediculous concotions of \"art\". To save the house from
    complete annihilation, my mom put me in art lessons as a kid which kept me occupied.
    Throughout high school, the only A's I received were in art....I was really into
    sketches, photography, and what nots.\r\nAlthough I've always remained a creator
    in some, more tangible mediums, I've actually developed an affinity for design
    on the computer. Learning about type and how it can be used just gives you a greater
    vocabulary in the world of creating things that grab people's attention. "
