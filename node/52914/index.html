  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">7-Zip program is a free, open source file compressor for Windows. Very capable and well-written proggy, saved me on more than on occasion, highly recommended, etc.

Their [[http://www.7-zip.org/7ziplogo.png|existing logo]] is bold and distinctive, but they don't appear to be paying much attention to the branding and pretty much "crowd-source" it. They have accumulated quite a bit of logos in [[http://www.7-zip.org/logos.html|their gallery]], though not many are actually notable.

Now .. there is a <strong>7</strong> and there is a <strong>Z</strong> in the name. If that's not a match made in a logotype heaven, I don't know what it :) 

Here's one of the ideas. It looked very nice and balanced on the paper, but now that it's vectorized, it seems to be missing something and I just can't put a finger on it.

Any thoughts, comments ?

		<div class="commentbody">Nice & simple! But it took me a while to recognize the Z, and how would it work on color backgrounds, since the 7 is an open shape?
If the Z was offset like a drop shadow, perhaps that would reinforce the top horizontal bar of the Z making it read more easily, and that also might close up the bottom of the 7...?</div>

well done.

Since it's an application icon, you may want to look at conveying the compressing aspect of the application similar to Stuffit's logo.</div>

The quick test below obviously needs a lot of work, but it shows the general idea of how this might make the partially-hidden Z clearer.

I like the general direction you're going, but in your first layout I don't care for the outline letter (for a number of reasons including that it probably won't reproduce well when small) and the Z is too hidden.

In your 2nd set of sketches, the solid 7 is an improvement, but in the left one the 7 looks stubby and the Z is still too hidden, and in the right-side one I don't see a Z at all. 

But I think your concept has possibilities. Perhaps the translucent idea I mentioned is worth a try; you also might try offsetting the letters slightly so the top of the 7 doesn't totally hide the top of the Z.

Evan, that's a great idea! I would probably add another serif (?) at the top left corner to make Z even more obvious.</div>

But try it. Try slightly different shapes on the serif as well to see if it needs to read more as a serif in that case.</div>

I like it a lot, I think it is very good. Now that I saw the combination it is indeed obvious :)

We tossed several ideas <a href=http://dribbble.com/shots/108978-Rebound-me>over at Dribbble</a>, and another Michael iterated his way to <a href=http://dribbble.com/shots/114489-7-ZIP-Rebrand>something similar to yours</a>. I then emailed the 7zip person saying "Here are some logo ideas" and never heard anything back, which was not exactly encouraging, and so I shelved the whole thing.
