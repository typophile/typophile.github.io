  suggest URW Grotesk as the typeface. Previous to working here, I had heard about
  Akzidenz Grotesk and am wondering what the differences/similarites are. Which do
  you prefer?\r\n\r\nAlso, I have paired URW Grotesk with Minion or Caslon (not URW
  Antiqua, I do not like that face). Is there a better option? Also are there display
  faces you might recommend paring with them? I want to have some opinions and options
  before purchasing more of the URW Grotesk family.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\njessi.long"

    personally prefer Akzidenz, but A. That's just me, and B. If the ID manuals suggest
    URW, yu might need to go with that.\r\n\r\nMinion and Caslon could both work with
    either, but you should pick one and stick with it.\r\n\r\nMinion is more clean
    and modern looking than Caslon, so that could factor in your decision."
