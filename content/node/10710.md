body: Dear fellow typophiles... <BR> <BR>Some time ago I posted a subject concerning
  my companylogo &#34;YESYES&#34; and I almost used all your suggestions... but still
  I&#39;m not quite satisfied with the result.. the characters are too vague.. a lack
  of expression I guess <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
  ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having a lot of trouble settling on a final
  design... This bothers me BIG TIME! <BR> <BR>I would appreciate your constructive
  criticism on the matter. Perhaps some suggestions of typefaces... anything actually!
  <BR> <BR>The triangle is optional! <BR> <BR>I thank you all in advance. <BR> <BR>/Henriko

  body: Henrik -- I really like the colors. And the mark itself I like as well. The
    positive and negative shapes. as the words get smaller, however, the &#39;Y&#39;
    starts to appear as a &#39;V&#39; -- I might also consider making the mark slightly
    larger next to the word. Have you tried slanting some of the terminals &#40;ooh
    suddently forgetting terminology.&#41;

    with Tiffany, the Y on the YESYES is too low, and I&#39;m not very happy with

    <BR> <BR>Tiffany&#62; I agree the &#34;Y&#34; is too low. I&#39;ve changed the
    form of it to a curved version &#40;Good input from Jean!&#41; and incombined
    LC characters instead. <BR> <BR>Le Bailly&#62; I&#39;m gonna make your idea with
    the round &#34;Y&#34; aswell.. thanks man! <BR> <BR>This FORUM rocks! <BR> <BR>I
    must admit that I&#39;m not really an expert in drawing vectors in Illustrator.
    Some tutorials would do me good <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Henrik, I mean curved to go inside not outside, check again parisine plus
    roman not italic. <BR> <BR>Your Y is now little too high and seems a bit narrow.
    <BR> <BR>And not straight horizontal top terminals for Y can be good to fit better
    with e and s endings? <BR> <BR>finally, S seems little wide

    having hard times just to get the curves to go inside <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>Do you normally set up a grid in order to make those
    kinda tricks ?? <BR>I&#39;m using Illustrator.. is it typo-friendly enough ??

  body: Henrik - I think having the convergence point in the &#34;Y&#34; line up with
    the crossbars on the E causes too much space and also seems a little &#42;TOO&#42;
    lined up. I do like it more. I also think the curves are in the wrong place. As
    Jean said. The use of lowercase and uppercase is a nice as well.

- author:
    name: superfetz
  body: Tiffany -&#62; Yep, that convergence point needs to be fixed... Still I like
    the simplicity of the curves in &#34;Y&#34; - perhaps I need to add a little detail
    to one of the letters... just can&#39;t decide which/what <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Now, you should try to get the letters optically adjusted. &#40;e is a bit
    too high, y should be a little bit fatter.&#41; <BR> <BR>--Jacques

    name: tmcalis566
  body: I agree with Jacques, I think the &#34;e&#34; is a little high, but optically,
    the second &#34;s&#34; seems to have just a little more space, in relation to
    the &#34;e&#34; than the other &#34;s&#34;, I might be wrong but it looks that
    way.
