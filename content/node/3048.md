  body: Martin, I hope it is ok that I moved your thread for you. This is fun. One
    thing that seems to be missing in the &#34;handwritten&#34; font category is an
    attempt to make complete families. I know there are fonts like this, but it seems
    to be something that could be done more of ... smallcaps, italic ... alternatives.

  body: This looks very natural. I would only go for a bigger Q, as it looks rather
    short next to the U.
