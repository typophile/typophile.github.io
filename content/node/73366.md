body: "I'm having trouble figuring out if it\u2019s possible to create a multiple
  master font from two separate weights of one font. I have designed a bold and a
  light version both in their own separate files. Is it possible to create a multiple
  master file from the two individual files? \r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at multiple
  master, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\u2014B"

  body: "Yes you can. Open both in FontLab Studio and go to Tools>Blend Fonts\u2026
    and select Build the Multiple Master font.\r\n\r\nThat should get you started.
    Read up on or experiment with the different panel options, and look in the FontLab
    Studio manual about the requirements of compatible outlines/contours etc.\r\n\r\nOnce
    you figure all that out look into Prepolator and Superpolator which is a superior
    way of building out multiple weights/styles."

  body: "Make sure each glyph has the same number and type of nodes. Also the start
    point must be in the same location.\r\n\r\nI would recommend ignoring the 'Blend\"
    feature and use the older \"Mask-to-Master\" Technique.\r\n\r\nAssign one of your
    font to the mask layer of the other. I find it easiest to assign the light weight
    to the mask layer of the bold. Use the Mask to master command, pick the MM Instance
    you want to be replaced by the Mask and make sure you check \"Do not insert points\"\r\n\r\nAll
    of this is in the FL manual. I learned how to do it by reading the instructions
    contained therein."

  body: "Thanks you all very much.\r\n\r\nI have tried out both techniques mentioned
    and believe the mask to master technique is the best for me.\r\n\r\nAlthough some
    of the glyphs after the process are appearing green, others red and some white.
    Is there a specific reason for this?\r\nI have gone through and made sure all
    of the starting points / directions are the same and still find it a bit tricky.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the links also Tim, infact the reason I am venturing into MM is so I can avail
    of your remix tools.\r\n\r\n\u2013B"

  body: "As you begin the MM process, make sure you go into Font Info and go to the
    Multiple Master Settings at the end. Move the slider to somewhere between the
    two masters. This will change the display in the font window and give you a clear
    idea which glyphs were successfully transformed.\r\n\r\nThe Green should mean
    a successful transformation, but sometimes the start points between the masters
    are different and, while the transformation has taken place, what you get is Frankenstein
    between the masters.\r\n\r\nRed means the transformation was not successful. for
    any number of reasons, different number of nodes, different path directions, or
    different number of contours between the masters are the most common. \r\n\r\nWhite
    usually means that the glyph was composed of Components, and while the base glyphs
    may or may not have changed, nothing has gone on in that particular location."

  body: You should also have a look at [[http://tools.typesupply.com/prepolator.html|Prepolator]].
    It is a tool specialised in making the node structure of two fonts compatible.
    Mac only, and it looks like if you work in FontLab you will have to export UFO
    and then re-import. Thought there was a video of Tal's presentation at Robothon
    2009 on Vimeo but it seems to be gone.
