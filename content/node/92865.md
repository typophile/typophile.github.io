  body: "I have seen Gill used as an effective display face.\r\n\r\nIt is a fiasco
    because the forms were weird to look at.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the aleph is too heavy
    and over-weighted compared to the other letters. Many designers do this, because
    the form of the aleph's middle bar is dominant.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill_heb_5380.JPG]"
