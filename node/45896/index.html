<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>EDIT: My reason for this post
I am starting a blog devoted purely to ambigrams. I was wondering who has done them before (as I have a few on my own) and who would like to contribute some of their work, sketches, and maybe a quick write-up about the process.
If you've ever done any of these, interested in doing one, or in the process of creating one, shoot me an email please to npgraphicdesign@yahoo.com. I'll email you back with more details, why I am asking for this, etc.
A short wikipedia link describing ambigrams - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram
These are ambigrams btw..

<div class=commentbody>I made some, right after reading Dan Brown's "Angels and Demons" (that's where these samples come from).

I used Illustrator. It boils down to "a good idea" (you can't just take any phrase and turn it into an ambigram), followed by a lot of work. Place an upside-down copy on a layer below your working copy; swap them at (ir)regular intervals until they are the same.
Another one, based on -- (what font was that?)

You had John Langdon as a professor? Oh jealousy overwhelms me! :)
I actually contacted him about a year ago to ask permission to use some of his ambigrams in a typography class that I was teaching. I'm working on a list of questions to ask him about ambigrams, and hoping that he'd be willing to answer them.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Fantômas for the inspiration to create a ambigram.
Busy working on a logotype for a personal project and the first image shows what I've come up with thus far. The second image is a brief timeline from initial sketch, and onto the progression of the design through various stages and methods of tweaking.
My next phase would be to look at adding some contrast to the weight of the strokes, but we'll see what happens, as that will inevitably lead to more adjustments to the characters. And so the process continues…
Feedback appreciated.

<div class=commentbody>Hello Everyone,
As some of you know from my Typophile or HOW Magazine forum posts, I'm starting up a blog devoted solely to ambigrams. Rather than have this blog be just a showcase of work, I would like it to be as much about the process as it is about the final product. So, this is what I'm asking the participants to contribute. I know that everyone is busy with work, life, family, etc. So submit what you can, and lets have a blast!!
Email to send the submissions to:
ambigblog@gmail.com
Required part of the submission:
a. One ambigram in jpg/gif/tiff format. You do not have to size it down to a specific size, as I will take care of that.
b. A few sentences about your ambigram. Include who the client was, whether it was a personal or freelance project, and why you decided to use an ambigram for the specific project. Include a sentence or two (or three) about your thought process if you can!!
c. The most important part: SKETCHES! More so than the work, I'd love to see the process. So any sketches you have, whether it's 1 or 10 sketches showing the creative process, please scan them in and send them to me. I will resize them and convert them to the appropriate file format. And the sketches do not have to be perfect; they can be as doodle-esque or unorganized as you want them to be, as long as they are SOMEWHAT clear ;) If you don't have any sketches, that's perfectly fine. I would still love to have your submissions for the blog!
Optional part of the submission:
a. More than one ambigram. I would like everyone to submit at least ONE. But if you have to time to submit more than one, along with sketches, descriptions, etc., why not??
Include the following with your submissions (only if you want to!):
a. A URL to your work (if you want people to look at your other work as well)
b. Your real name or a monicker (could be a forum nickname, could be another nickname, etc) but someway to identify yourselves
"I will not post any of your personal contact info, email, URL, name or otherwise without your explicit permission."
And finally, spread the word! I want this to be a website about ambigrams, about the process, and about networking and getting to know artists that have similar interests! If you know anyone who is interested in ambigrams, who has created them before, or wants to take a crack at it, send forward this email to them or have them shoot me an email with some questions, which I will be more than happy to answer.
Some other things to be included on the website: interviews with artists and well known designers that specialize in ambigrams and typography, case studies, etc. I will shoot out periodic emails informing everyone of new developments!
Thanks everyone! Looking forward to all the great work!
Nikita</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like Randy's: for one thing it has the benefit of readability. (I think Langdon said that Blackletter was the lest resort when other styles weren't gonna work.)
For my own part, not up to the technical quality of some these, but I did paint this one onto a mug for a colleague who was leaving just last month...

<div class=commentbody>One of the first dedicated Mac software packages was from Scott Kim and Robin Fe Samelson called 'Letterforms and Illusion'. It was based on Scott Kim's book 'Inversions' that he published in 1981 (see illustration). There was a design page in the magazine OMNI which explored ambigrams, probably also by Scott Kim. I still have the software, but no Mac anymore with MacOS 6 or 7...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inversions_5953.gif]</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have looked all over your post, your e-mails, and your website, and I <strong>cannot find a link to the blog itself.</strong> Where is it? To "spread the word" about something, people have to be able to see it, and get some idea of what you have to offer besides pleas for content.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I assumed from that fact, that "I am starting" really meant "I am going to start (but haven't yet...)"

you're right, and it wasn't meant to be a plea. Just a humble request...but i realize that post-whoring my blog everyone isn't a good approach either.</div>
