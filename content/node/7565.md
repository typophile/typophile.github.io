    polished ones in their neck of the woods &#40;literally&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; Black
    pants, .... <BR> <BR>The fifth issue of m-Real magazine was called Black &amp;
    White, and one of the features was a bunch of man-in-the-street quickie interviews
    with people dressed all-black, in Paris. It was pretty cool. And of the 30 people
    interviewed &#40;each with a great little photo&#41;, one was &#40;or least called
    himself&#41; an &#34;interior designer&#34; and another was an &#34;artist&#34;.
    The largest group was &#34;student&#34;s, about half a dozen. And the best reply
    to &#34;Why are you wearing black?&#34; was: &#34;It matches my shadow.&#34; <BR>

    start murdering more civilians in Falluja? <BR> <BR>Their president wouldn&#39;t

    a niche market with vigor. Good for them.

  body: "Vigor, gun - whatever works, right?\r\n\r\n=^)\r\n\r\nWhat we've found is
    that the hunting and fishing (and outdoor market) has very few designers that
    they can work with where they don't have to spend large amounts of time helping
    them \"get\" the product and end user of their products.\r\n\r\nWe are unique
    in that Hughes Design, and our network of writers and creative folks make their
    living writing, living, guiding and living the outdoor lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWe spend
    more time working for the client, and they spend less time explaining the right
    end of a gun or fly reel to get the job done.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the message has
    to be believed.  It's hard to fake it if you don't know hunting, fishing and the
    outdoors.\r\n\r\nWe do.  And, we're having fun doing it.\r\n"

    can't hear plants scream when you eat a salad doesn't make you a better person,
