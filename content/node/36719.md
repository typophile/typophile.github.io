  question. \r\n\r\nI'm cleaning up workflow at a magazine that's small but growing
  very, very quickly, and the staff before me just went crazy designing thousands
  of ads for clients over the course of 3 years because there wasn't a standard list
  for them to choose from. This has resulted in a multitude of costly problems for
  production. We're in a process of synchronization right now.\r\n\r\nSo, I need a
  couple of common serif fonts, a couple of sans serif, and whatever comes in between
  that's diverse enough to meet the advertising needs of hundreds of clients that
  aren't creating ads themselves. This is NOT for our house identity - they're just
  for Regular Joe Restaurant, etc., who call us up and want to pay for an ad and need
  us to design it quickly.\r\n\r\nSo, I need a list sort of like:\r\n\r\nAvantGardeITC\r\nBaskervilleMT\r\nBauerBodoni\r\nFranklinGothic\r\nFrutiger\r\nGillSans\r\nMyriad\r\nOfficinaSans\r\nOfficinaSerif\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
  I don't want ad designers flipping out because the list isn't diverse enough to
  do what they need. You know? Help.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Hi vectorgirl - looks OK to me except that you have Frutiger, Myriad, Gill,
    Officina ie 4 (perfectly decent) humanist Sans faces, but just Franklin for the
    Gothics. I''d say drop Frutiger or Gill and get Univers instead. Also Bembo or
    something similar would come in handy for some elegance and class... '
