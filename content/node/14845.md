body: Alot of you are familiar with my previous Fiberpack Audio design. Now I am working
  with one of their competitors (hey I couldn't say no) to design their logo. The
  name is Andromeda Audio Networks. There is a much better visual potential here,
  namely the metaphor of constellations as networks. Just looking for some comments
  on my first hack at it. Thanks!

  body: "I think what you have is too busy and not dynamic enough. The silhouette
    of the mountain range creates an awkward white space between the graphic and the
    name.\r\n\r\nTry other variations on the constellation theme and perhaps other
    non-star related concepts.\r\n\r\nI'm rusty on my mythology, but could you draw
    anything from who Andromeda was?"

  body: "Andromeda, daughter of Caseopea, was chained to a rock to die as penance
    for her mother's insults to the gods. She was rescued by Perseus.\r\n\r\nThat
    theme was not to uplifting or appropriate for a corporate logo, so I thought I'd
    just stick with the constellation. Unfortunately, as you can see, the constellation
    of Andromeda leaves much to be desired. I'm having a hard time coming up with
    something interesting that can stand alone with just that silly V shape."

    classic beauty among galaxies.\r\nTry working with just the classic spiral galaxy
    shape.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The current treatment of the stars is a natural looking one, however you
    may well run into problems when this logo has to be used at smaller sizes than
    shown in your example. Issues such as dot gain and variable pressmanship may cause
    these fine details to fill in on printed matter, and will also suffer when used
    on screen. Adopting an approach which uses larger, stylised pointed star shapes
    would be both punchier and more robust.\r\n\r\nI would get rid of the tan colour
    for the constellation, and design the logo in black and white only until you are
    completely happy with the shapes. For colour variations you could consider replacing
    the black of the sky with a very deep blue."

  body: You are limiting yourself with this concept. A hard horizontal isn't going
    to work for all applications. Try AAN with a star (or a few stars) with the name
    stacked under it in 3 lines. By doing this you can over time establish AAN star(s),
    as their look much like the Dallas Cowboys. I guess what I'm saying is you are
    being to literal.

  body: "Yeah, what Dan and others have said. Make the stars/constellation the focus.
    The mountains are extraneous.\r\n\r\nThe constellations/networks thing is good,
    but you're not emphasizing it enough. Perhaps you could design an interesting
    network-ish web of connections, with a central emphasized shape that looks like
    an 'A'? Maybe?\r\n\r\nDunno, but Andromeda's a galaxy, not just a constellation,
    so I think of <a href=\"http://www.science-explorer.de/astronomie/space-andromeda.jpg\">this</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.starshine.com/frankn/astronomy/images/Andromeda.gif\">this</a>
    more than the form in your first design.\r\n\r\nThe typeface is interesting. Though
    I guess it'll change with the different concepts."

  body: "Have you thought about being more abstract? For instance use the positioning
    of the stars in reality for the positioning of the letters literally. It's subtle
    and it'd let a strong typeface do more of the corporate talking. Just a thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph

  body: "I'd suggested, as other people, to be more abstract. What if you used dot
    at different size above the name? I also suggested to use two typeface, a strong
    one for Andromeda and medium on for Audio Media, probably in the same family.
    I'll place the name on two lines to avoid to be too wide.\r\n\r\n> Andre"
