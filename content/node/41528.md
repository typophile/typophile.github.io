  body: The second still looks like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/century_gothic/?sample_text=created%20by%20DAVID%20SHORE&sample_size=24">Century
    Gothic</a> to me. Note the large x-height and goofy 'S' and 'R'.

  body: yep, you're right stephen, the credits look like century gothic... still think
    the main title is more 'futuraey' though... ah, those geometric sans, they're
    such copy cats :-)

  body: "As for the names of the cast members, I vote Century Gothic.  \r\n\r\nThe
    titles are here: http://vimeo.com/5848690\r\n\r\nIf you look at the name Robert
    Sean Leonard in that video, the crossbars of the E and of the A are at very close
    heights, whereas in Futura (and, for that matter, in Tw Cen MT), the crossbar
    of A is much lower.  Also the base of the L seems to be just as wide as the base
    of the E, whereas in Futura, the base of the L is shorter than that of the E.\r\n\r\nForgive
    me if I got any of those typographic terms wrong -- I'm but a newbie in this whole
    world!"
