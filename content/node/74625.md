body: A pdf document uses The Sans Office. Is there any difference with a normal The
  Sans regular? I've compared the preview and a piece of text I set to The Sans and
  they look the same...

  body: "I'm confused ;-) If the pdf document uses The Sans Office and some graphic
    designer must continue designing the magazine and the font files aren't available,
    could he use The Sans or should he buy The Sans Office also? \r\n\r\nAs I understand
    it it is just a regular The Sans, but slightly adapted (not in appearance!) to
    make it work in Microsoft Office better? The designer can use just the regular
    The Sans in Indesign?"

    are used in TheSans Office. I'm not sure that these figures are also in the PS
    version. So if you have the OpenType version, you can use that one, but mind the
    figures!\r\n"
