    So if it comes from Industrie Magazine, that should be it.\r\nQuoted from this
    previous discussion.\r\n<blockquote>This is the house font of Saturday Group,
    created for Industrie magazine. It's a custom version based on a Big Caslon with
    a modern twist in it. So far, it has 4 cuts: Medium, Light, Light Italic and Sans
    (not used yet). Thanks for your interest.</blockquote>"
