    if you click on the \"Cached\" you'll be able to watch snapshots of dead pages.
    For example, here's a <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=prev&topic=83&page=1032\"
    target=\"new\">dead link</a>, and here is its corresponding <a href=\"http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:pPn8LBRwkhUJ:www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl%3Fpg%3Dprev%26topic%3D83%26page%3D1032+site:typophile.com+september+details&hl=en\"
    target=\"new\">cache</a>. Neat, innit?"

    I downloaded the neat little bit that puts the typophile/google search into your
    toolbar, which speeds up the process. But I can't remember which thread I found
    it on.\r\n\r\nAll right now I'm a bigger nincompoop, Cached is in Google.\r\nI
    was looking on the dead link. D-oh."
