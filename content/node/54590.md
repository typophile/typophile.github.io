body: "Hi guys - Found this site while researching a Typography role for a client
  of mine. They're hiring a Typography expert for their team - we're not looking for
  graphic artists, more the OO guru. If this is you, I'd love to hear from you. More
  details:\r\n\r\nMost important : Looking for a math wizard who has a strong understanding
  of object-oriented programming (correct usage of several design patterns being an
  example). Versatility in any modern OO language (C++, C#, Java, etc.) is ideal.
  \r\n\u2022 text formatting, flow, and word wrapping\r\n\u2022 international typography
  (simple and complex scripts, text direction, grid layouts) \r\n\u2022 computational
  geometry / Graphics programming (spline-based shapes, intersections, bounding boxes,
  transformation matrices) \r\n\u2022 computational aesthetics (page layout, color
  theory)\r\n\r\nThis is a role for someone who loves coding as much as strategy -
  would love any help on this. \r\n\r\nHave a great week - JT\r\n\r\nJennifer Tortorella-Taylor\r\n978.474.4455\r\njtortorella@footbridgestaffing.com\r\n\r\n"

    if I was interested.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you aren't necessarily going to find
    many programmers here.  :(\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
