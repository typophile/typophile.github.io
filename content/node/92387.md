  body: The thing is, the average font is never going to be rounded and blobby at
    the joins. Since he's modified the letter shapes anyway from the rendering, wouldn't
    an interesting and possibly fruitful avenue be to look at the result and try to
    create regular font outlines based on the proportions and shapes? The font would
    be far from average (the cut-and-curve a, for instance, would be interesting!),
    but perhaps fun.

  body: "Whatever the rationale, the end product is pleasing at least to my eye. Its
    soft edges and loose spacing convey a feeling of warmth and sincerity, and are
    a simple joy to read.\r\n\r\nWhether or not my perception is clouded by reading
    too many old letterpress-printed books\u2014where such rounding occurs through
    wear and ink accumulation\u2014or that the forms themselves are simply more optically
    inviting is a question I will leave to those far more knowledgeable than me on
    such subjects."

    which was based on the really awful (by later standards) printed quality of a
    \u201Cblobby\u201D Sweynham & Paanartz' 15th century face, I decided to rationalize/stylize
    the serif treatment, with convex \uFB02ares, but giving them a slight sharpness.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ns2_4720.png]"

    Does not give credit to his sources.\r\n\r\nWhy no list of fonts? Why no credit

    of what proper averaging would be, the article notes that he <em>looked</em> at
    the outlines.\r\n\r\nSo it's not clear that he went on afterwards to average the
    outlines instead of the shapes - which would have potentially led to a licensing
    issue."
