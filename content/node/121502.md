  font is very simple, see the link below for a sketch of what I am aiming for. \r\n\r\nI've
  been able to produce a font where each character appears as I'd like it, but I want
  to somehow kern the font so that there is zero space between letters. I'd actually
  like the right edge of each letter to overlap with the left edge of the next letter.\r\n\r\nI
  know i can mess with the type settings in photoshop to get it to appear like I want
  it, but that is a good bit of work, so I was wondering if there was a simple way
  to adjust the font so that I can use it at any size, in more word-processing-friendly
  applications.\r\n\r\n[[http://spacexjunk.tumblr.com/post/100691118080|EXAMPLES]]
  - i painted these in photoshop, but I'd like to be able to make a font that produces
  similar results.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What font editor are you using? The thing is in any font editor it's possible
    to set the left and right sidebearings to be negative, i.e. on the inside of the
    actual outlines.\r\n\r\nBTW if you make the bounds *exactly* on the edge of the
    letterforms you might get funny rendering artifacts where two letterforms abut;
    they actually need to overlap slightly. I typically go at least two em units to
    the inside of an outline when I want a clean overlap.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Your examples look nice, but since they don't show individual glyphs I might
    not fully understand your problem. It looks like they all have the same advance
    width, which probably is a good thing.\r\n\r\nTo set all left and right side bearings
    with <a href=\"http://www.high-logic.com/font-editor/fontcreator.html\">FontCreator</a>,
    just use the Transform wizard:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bearings_6336.png]\r\n\r\nNote:
    it is recommended to exclude empty glyphs (e.g. .null, nonmarkingreturn, and the
    space character)"
