  Do you know which font is this one? I first thought it was Rotis Sans but now i
  think i am wrong.\r\n\r\nWould you think this font could be right for long paragraph
  text like a philosophy book?\r\n\r\nThanks for any info ;-)"

      Mix would be good for body text in a book? or better choose a Serif type.\r\n\r\nCheers, "

  body: No, I don't think it would be good. Text generally needs a proper serif face
    to be 'easily' readable, not that philosophy is always easy . . .

  body: "Generally speaking, serif faces are empirically best suited for immersive
    reading (such as it would presumably be needed in a philosophy essay). That doesn\u2019t
    mean that there couldn\u2019t be beautiful and readable longer texts set using
    sans serif faces (or that a book about philosophy couldn\u2019t have a different
    form than the traditional treatise).\r\nHowever, I\u2019m afraid something like
    TheMix would be distracting for anything other than short paragraphs."

  body: "thanks for your comments. I did ask about The Mix font because i founded
    quite clean and easy to read. I was sort of thinking it could work in longer paragraphs
    too but maybe it is a no no situation.\r\n\r\nAny sans serifs faces that you would
    recommend for long immersive reading? Just curious.\r\n\r\nThanks ;-)"

  body: It is my understanding that typeface serifs derive from manuscript writing
    which included the effort to make "immersive reading" better than it otherwise
    would be. Therefore, and in my limited experience as a reader, writer, editor,
    there is no sans serif typeface that works well in such situations. One might
    say so to speak that "immersive reading" and sans serif typefaces are contraditions
    in terms.
