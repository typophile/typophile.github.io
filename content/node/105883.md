  by individual type designers.\r\n\r\nIt's probably running by another type designer
  and not every typeface can't be part of the archive. There are some speficic rules
  that apply.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100%, but I think it has some typefaces from Werkplaats
  students.\r\n\r\nI just can't remember the link. Anyone knows what I'm talking about,
  please?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nMilan\r\n\r\n"
