  obviously don't want to use it at such large sizes so that the faux-hot-metal detailing
  becomes too obvious. Can anybody recommend some complimentary faces to use for headlines?
  I'm aiming for something of a utilitarian feel, officious and tweedy but lots of
  character.. all recommendations very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nJez"
