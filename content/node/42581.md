  it myself, looking at the horizontally cut terminals of the C, i first thought it
  could be Helvetica. Looking at the R however, that theory prooved wrong.\r\nI believe
  it might be some kind of Gothic, not quite ITC AvantGarde Gothic eighter...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cover_6424.jpg]"

  body: 'Running it through What the Font gives 3 responses: Europa, Nimbus and Helvetica,
    and for "COVE" I''d buy that, but the straight leg of the "R" doesn''t jive with
    those responses. Unless it''s a modified word. What is the origin of this image,
    that might help clarify things a little. Especially if this is a Logo. '

  body: It's not anything digital that I know. The closest match is actually <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/helvetica_neue_lt_std_black/?sample_text=COVER&sample_size=74">Helvetica</a>
    with a straight leg 'R'. I'm going to predict a custom drawn logo.

    it with anything either. I was starting to get quite annoyed about this one, but
    i guess that sometimes you just have to leave it.\r\nCheers anyway. "

    to you Jan, yeah that was my first thought also, looking the \"C\" and the \"R\"
    \u2013 but all i said that it's not Corpo S, nothing more \u2026\r\n\r\n@Gregers\r\nMaybe
    custom?\r\n\r\n\r\nPS \r\nI want an interpretation of a Neo Grotesk made by Michael
