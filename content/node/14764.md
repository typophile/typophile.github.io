  I need an image for the letter O, V, and a different type of O. <em>(This will be
  hard to guess what I am using this one for ;)</em>\r\n\r\nI know a lot of you snap
  up digital images of this type of thing. Would anyone be willing to share? <em>(I
  will disclose usage with you privately)</em>"

    provide you with high-res close-ups of letters. Might be a good idea to render
    lowres photographs into vector-format, to loose the highres-problem.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy
