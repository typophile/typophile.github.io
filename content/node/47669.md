body: "i'm looking to find a font which i believe is called MAGOO. it was used about
  10 years ago to create the logo for the company i'm currently working with. i don't
  know where it was purchased and search after search has yielded no results [other
  than websites for mr. magoo.]\r\n\r\ni'd appreciate ANY help in either finding this
  font to purchase or a [very] reasonable match i can use to set other headlines with
  in marketing media. it was an old postscript font designed to be used on the mac.
  that's about all i know ...\r\n\r\nthx for your expertise. the identification and
  location of this thing has eluded me for months now and i'm sincerely begging for
  mercy from the creative community!"

    with Hallmark card-making software.\r\n\r\nEdit: Mike Yanega offers a nice showing
    of the font in his <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg24.html\"

  body: "Yes, I thought this font looked familiar. Mike F gave me most of the Hallmark
    font samples, I have shown, but that particular one came from Paul Hunt, who made
    some larger samples for me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
