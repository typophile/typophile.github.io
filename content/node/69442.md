  want to substitute multiple glyphs with multiple alternate glyphs.\r\n\r\nFor example,
  if I type chalk, I want it to be replaced by cha.alt and lk.alt. \r\n\r\nCan't do:\r\nsub
  c' h' a' by cha.alt;\r\n\r\nbecause if I type champ, I don't want the .alt.\r\n\r\nI
  can do:\r\nsub c' h' a' l k  by cha.alt;\r\nsub cha.alt l' k' by lk.alt;\r\n\r\nIs
  that as simple as I can get, or can I make it one line of code?\r\n\r\nI'd ideally
  like this:\r\nsub c h a l k by cha.alt and lk.alt;\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nMcs\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    happens.

  body: "It's not really an OT order thing so much as a group-replace function.\r\n\r\nIf
    I were to type \"international\" and I wanted it to force \"int'l\" to replace
    it, with each letter being an independent glyph, how could (or can I at all) do
    that?\r\n\r\nI want a group of letters in a particular order to be replaced by
    a different group of letters in a different particular order, not necessarily
    of the same count for each group.\r\n\r\nCan it be done?"

  body: "Have no idea if the following will help you \r\n\r\n\"mergeFonts\r\nThis
    program will merge glyphs from one font into another, optionally copying a subset
    from the source fonts, and changing the names of the glyphs. It can also be used
    to subset and change the glyph names in a font. By using the same font more than
    once as a source with different mapping files, glyphs can be duplicated under
    other names.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, just ran across it yesterday. Its part of the Adobe
    Font Development Kit -some utilities they made available, though not documented
    super well.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_overview.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "OpenType cannot do many-to-many substitutions. It can to one-to-one, one-to-one-out-of-many,
    many-to-one and one-to-many (though the last one is not supported by some applications).
    \r\n\r\nTo achieve what you're trying to do, you need a series of lookups, each
    performing a many-to-one substitution. Each lookup is executed on the glyph string
    produced by the previous lookup. So: \r\n\r\n<code>feature calt { \r\nlookup calt1
    { \r\nsub c' h' a' l k by c_h_a.alt;\r\n} calt1;\r\nlookup calt2 {\r\nsub c_h_a.alt
    l' k' by l_k.alt;\r\n} calt2;\r\n} calt;</code>\r\n\r\nNote above that I've used
    PDF-compatible glyphnames for ligatures. c_h_a.alt and l_k.alt will be \"understood\"
    by PDF applications while cha.alt and lk.alt will not, i.e. copy-paste or searching
    may not work properly. \r\n\r\nAdam"
