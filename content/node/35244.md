  deciding what leading to use, 10pt or 11pt. I'm interested in hearing a general
  consensus as to what the members of Typophile prefer, especially from the members
  with considerable experience with the typeface.\r\n\r\nMy best,\r\nMario"

  body: One thing which might sway the leading is column width. How wide are your
    columns? 8pt is pretty small.

  body: Personally, 8/10pt is fine, but because it's a small point size, I'd probably
    go with the extra leading.

  body: "That\u2019s a wide measure for 8pt, how much copy is there, how are you separating
    paragraphs, how are you printing it (if you are printing), so many questions,
    my instinct is that 11pt is required.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: I don't exceed the "x" height of the lowercase as a rule for leading.

    minus images, etc. For now I'm stuck with the font, page size and column width.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?emsek22uvnl\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?aneceimfd4v\r\n\r\nThank
