    tolerances in the aircraft construction are more precise!\r\n\r\nWhat is that,

  body: Btw. The text is rather small for that huge airplane. I would have made the
    logo much bigger! I get the feeling they say "Hey we're one on the biggest airlines
    now, but let us not tell any one..." I get an odd feeling somehow.

    to travellers experiences dealing with United flight attendants.
