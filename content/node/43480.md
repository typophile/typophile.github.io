body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm writing a series of books on world religions and contemporary
  spirituality (read: grounded in the wisdom of the world religions, but the accent
  is on spirituality applied to our lives today).  I have been looking at various
  typefaces to see which ones would be a good fit for the cover title.  I find Cataneo
  BT quite appealing.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cataneo/cataneo/\r\n\r\nI
  like the strong structure as well as the flair of the h, g, f, etc.  It matches
  the content of what I'm writing: structure and flair.\r\n\r\nI wanted to find out:
  if you know that I like the look and feel for Cataneo as a title for a spiritual
  book, are there other fonts similar or even dissimilar that create the same look
  and feel?\r\n\r\nDo you have any other suggestions?  I want to avoid anything medieval
  looking since my focus is on our time and culture today.  \r\n\r\nThank you very
  much for your help.\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"

    for your consideration <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/le-griffe-2/\">Linotype
    Le Griffe</a> (designer: Andre-Michel Lubac; publisher: Linotype), <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/sherwoodtype/afton.html\">P22
    Afton</a> (designer: Ted Staunton; publisher: Sherwood Type), <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/medici-script/\">Medici
    Script</a> (designer: Hermann Zapf; publishers: Adobe and Linotype), or even <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/feather-pen/\">Feather Pen</a>
    (designer: John Nahmias; publisher: JonahFonts).\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n"

    Just as an example Leitura by DS Type http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura/\r\n"
