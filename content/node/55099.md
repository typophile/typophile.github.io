  some links to main forum and your subforum of choice and post in your Typophile

  body: "Google should only need 'http://www.typophile.com/forums'. I think the problem
    is that 'http://www.typophile.com/' has no links that are followable by google
    (too much Flash).\r\n\r\nBarring a fix of the home page, it might make sense to
    submit site maps to google."

    fix is not to rely on a third-parties for your site's search functionality, especially
    those motivated by ad revenue, and who accept ads that many typophile members
    would consider shady?  "

    Typophile. Don't know if these ads are shady - just sayin' you give up a lot when
    you let someone else control your visitor's search experience. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaptureGoog_3655.JPG]"

  body: "Having both searches available is the best option, IMHO. A good internal
    search can use the localhost's DB to search down into every nook and cranny, which
    is of course, crappy on this site.\r\n\r\nBut having your site indexed by Google
    is a Good Thing\u2122, for more than simple searches. There are, after all, sponsored
    ads on this site. And a Google search with Typophile results may attract more
    users. Many typographic discussions outside of Typophile could be answered simply
    by one of our many discussions, but I never see a Typophile show up in relevant
    results. I saw lots of this in college, and I still do as a professional. Some
    things that I know we have discussed here never showed up for relevant searches.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you do a Google search, MANY of the results pages will show <strong>SEARCH</strong>
    pages, rather than the relevant content page. (Which is a Cardinal Sin for SEO
    folks.) Search pages should be \"noindex, nofollowed\".\r\n\r\nAn XML sitemap
    would do the trick, but considering the years this forum has been around, it would
    be a b* to get set up properly. It would certainly have to be dynamically generated
    by Drupal, but I don't know if Drupal's XML Sitemap Generator has the capabilities
    for proper multi-sitemap functionality.\r\n\r\n@Sii\r\nNice email address :)"
