  help locating some logos that have people or figures of people in them.\r\nI have
  one in my head that has connecting people, almost as if they were paper cut-outs
  (like a paper snowflake). I can't think where I've seen it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows
  what I'm referring to or knows a particular logo that has people in it, please post
  it here. I need to get my creative juices flowing and I'm stuck right now.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much-\r\n"

  body: kmac. it sounds to me like you are a good candidate for Logo Lounge. It seems
    to me that there are other links concerning this. Did you search through Speak
    Up?
