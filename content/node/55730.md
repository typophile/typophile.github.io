  body: "As Simon said, there is already a Unicode slot for the Rupee currency symbol,
    and a recommended form, which I have rendered in several fonts, e.g:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rs_3579.jpg]\r\nBut
    it's not really in the same league as the leading monetary symbols, and doesn't
    work with \"1\", so I can see why some people might think it needs an upgrade."
