  to have a font where part of it needs to be in javascript.  Actually one letter
  only, is there a possibility to put javascript letter within a font?  Though if
  technically it is not possible with only 1 letter then a total javascript font.
  \ Thus is a total font in javascript possible?\r\n\r\nThis letter \u0915 on the
  posting, is it in javascript, can the k/K on a font be removed and this \u0915 javascript
  be put instead?  This will allow users to type with this javascript on text editors
  or wordprocessors that allow javascript any internet content that can then be copy/pasted. "
