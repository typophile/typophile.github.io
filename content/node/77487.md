  I just wanted to comment in regards to the folks who were having difficulty with
  the transfer between Illustrator and TypeTool/FontLab. The way that FontLab works
  is logical, given that in font world there are no decimal numbers. However, for
  folks who are very comfortable in Illustrator, it would be nice to have a tool that
  automatically rounds all points (which have already been drawn) to whole points
  while keeping the integrity of the font.\r\n\r\nBut I once drew a typeface, and
  when I discovered the way FontLab works, I had to go in and move each anchor (ones
  that resulted from effects, rounding, etc). I had set up the grip as directed by
  FontLab, but that doesn't cover you in all situations.\r\n\r\nSo I have created
  a script that takes care of the non-integer anchors. If you have already drawn your
  typeface, or don't want to be too concerned with snapping while illustrating, this
  Illustrator script will be perfect for you. It automatically rounds all selected
  anchors to the closest whole integer, whether that means up or down. With a standard
  UPM of 1000, the tweaking is hardly noticeable. With a higher value for more precision,
  the tweaking would be nearly impossible to see. However, it makes it so that your
  art transfers perfectly into FontLab/TypeTool. I know there are some purists who
  will object, but to those of us who are very comfortable in Illustrator, this is
  an invaluabale tool, I believe.\r\n\r\nHere it is: [[http://www.derekweathersbee.com/products/typebridge-script|TypeBridge]]\r\n\r\nLet
  me know if you have any questions or feedback. (Not hatemail)."
