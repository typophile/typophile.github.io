body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI need a font for a translator graphic identity. I've been using
  Swift, but the new glyphs resuled from the exactly phonetical translation are not
  drawn in Swift (see the glypss in the attach file). There are fonts like Fedra and
  Retina for dictionary uses (consequently maybe with this glyphs drawn) but I will
  use the font in 48 pt or bigger and Fedra, Retina and Minuscule are not beatifull
  like, for example, Swift.\r\n\r\nSo the question is \xBFDo you know some nice serif
  typefaces for dictionary use?\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"
