body: "Hi everyone. As someone who aspires to go into book design I've been planning
  to buy a few good fonts and getting to know them really well. At the moment I was
  thinking of buying <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Athelas\">Athelas</a>
  simply because I think the letters look very elegant, but I was wondering if I might
  ask for your opinions about matching fonts? It would be good to have a sans-serif
  that goes well with Athelas (maybe something like <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026\">Whitney</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/54897/linotypesyntax-family.html\">Syntax</a>?),
  but does anyone have any suggestions about that? As well as this does anyone have
  any thoughts about titling fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for all your help,\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: Your idea is good. Athelas seems to work very well with Whitney. Other sans
    I would consider are DTL Caspari and OurType Eva.

    with its long ascenders and descenders is a good match to Athelas.'

  body: "I don't think you can have a \"matching font\" in the abstract, without any
    idea of context.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do agree with Juergen that vertical proportions
    are important, especially for the situation where you have a subheading or more
    critically a sideheading in bold sans, to go with serifed text. In that situation,
    the two faces should look \"the same size\" at the same point size. \r\n\r\nAnd
    again, if you are mixing two faces in text, you should have the extenders similar
    in length, or else the leading will look too open or too tight, depending on which
    of the two faces is being looked at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks to everyone who's responded already. It looks like there are some
    good typefaces here. I guess it is a little naive of me to look for the one true
    matching font for my library. I think I'll aim to get a decent sans-serif with
    similar proportions, then I can learn for myself when the typefaces work well
    together and at the end of the day I'll still have a good sans-serif whatever
    happens.\r\n\r\nThanks again for everyone's help (more suggestions and advice
    are always welcome).\r\n\r\nChris "
