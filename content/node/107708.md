    could be applied to all fonts and eventually all printed material in the Latin

    to also change the lowercase and uppercase forms of the letter \"K\" to reduce
    suicidal thoughts...\r\n\r\n"

    body: "@donshottype:\r\n<cite>Or they could re-introduce the Fraktur k -- which
      looks upside down.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt took a quick search to determine which Fraktur
      k you were referring to. Some typefaces, billed as Fraktur, use a k that looks
      ordinary; most of the ones I saw had the top part of the K-like portion of the
      k looped as in handwriting.\r\n\r\nBut more authentic Fraktur typefaces showed
      up on Luc Devroye's web site.\r\n\r\nStart with a lowercase t. But instead of
      the letter coming to a point at the top, put serifs there similar to those at
      the top of the lowercase l.\r\n\r\nAnd then the crossbar: instead of having
      a curve from the left end of the crossbar going up to the top of the letter,
      filled in with black, have an upward-sloping curved line that sweeps upward,
      crosses the vertical of the t, and then sweeps downward.\r\n\r\nThe shape is,
      of course, unfamiliar and unrecognizable to readers used to the Roman alphabet.
      My initial impression was of an r standing on top of a t. But at least it has
      historical roots, and can be adapted to Roman style faces.\r\n\r\nHere's an
      image of t, l, and k in one authentic Fraktur face:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kver_4290.jpg]\r\n\r\nhowever,
      in this one, the sloping line, instead of just curling down, becomes a loop;
      still, most of my description is illustrated."

  body: "> reduce ambiguity under reflection, so that it would be useful for dyslexics?\r\n\r\nPopular
    belief notwithstanding, I have seen no evidence that this is an actual problem
    for dyslexics in reading (as opposed to in writing). Indeed, the failure of typefaces,
    designed with this notion in mind, to perform any better for dyslexics than common
    off-the shelf typefaces, would seem to be reasonably good evidence to the contrary."

    brings up are of the looped form, and I can't find much in the way of good examples

    seems that Clear Sans from Intel was released before Clear Sans from Positype,
    and in any case, I'm not sure 'Clear Sans' will become an \xAE because its too

    the closest to a hippie licence is the BSD type (the B stands for Berkeley in
    California), and that one could hardly care less if you productise the material.

    restriction in the GPL, though, is not intended to be dog in the mangerish, or
    anti-capitalist (despite Richard Stallman occasionally engaging in rhetoric of
    a sort as to give rise to Hrant's comment).\r\n\r\nInstead, it's so that one can't
    make a slight, obvious improvement to a GPL program, copyright the result, and
    thereby hobble the free version of that program by preventing it from implementing
    the same improvement.\r\n\r\nAs for Clear Sans, given that its intended purpose
    is to be a typeface for <em>user interfaces</em>, it had better be conservative,
    because who would want to work all day on a computer screen where everything is
    written in an idiosyncratic typeface?"
