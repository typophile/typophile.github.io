  VHS tape covers from the late 80's.\r\nIt's pretty, dare I say, \"radical\"\r\n\r\nThank
  you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ninja Turtles - 80s font_5965.png]"

    not a font.\r\nHowever, if you use the Edit link to move the thread up to the
    main Type ID Board, someone could give some suggestions on similar ones."
