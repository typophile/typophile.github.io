  my problem. Bare with me.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find where in InDesign CS3 to insert
  the \"number\" of the kern for specific fonts so that CS remembers the given \"number\".\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "Among Peter Kahrel's valuable scripts is <a href=\"http://www.kahrel.plus.com/indesign/kern.html\">one</a>
    that allows InDesign users to create and apply custom kerning pairs.  I can't
    say I've used it yet, but I'm intrigued.\r\n\r\nDavid"
