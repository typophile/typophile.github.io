  body: The idea of giving China the Olympics so that they would clean their act didn't
    quite work. It's easy to promise all kinds of reforms but not to do anything about
    them. By the time the mistake was spotted it was too late to change the location.

    I have a right to express my disgust at the Chinese government's rejection of
    peaceful protest as a lawful activity. In this regard, it does not matter what
    ills my country has done\u2014I still have the right to express my opinion.\r\n\r\nMy
    personal opinion, by the way, is not that there should be an official \"boycott.\"
    I think that the games should go forward. We should just not care about them.
    Imagine if no world leaders would attend at all, and no one in the west would
    watch the programs on TV. That would be the best thing, I think. Then the Chinese
    people and athletes from around the word could still have their big Olympic party,
    but the Chinese government officials would know that they had lost, and that no
    one outside their country believes in them or supports them anymore.\r\n\r\nLike
    James, I normally only watch a few Olympic events casually on TV. But this year,
    I will not be tuning in at all."

    approach of engagement and pressure seems to me much more productive than boycott.
    It seems that''s what the Dalai Lama wants too, if I heard rightly. '

  body: "Remember when they were wondering whether the Olympic Games being awarded
    to China would turn out like the 1936 Berlin Games or the 1988 Seoul Games--a
    celebration of a dictatorship or a push toward democracy?\r\n\r\nWhy I was somewhat
    insulted by this comparison as a South Korean: China may not be Nazi Germany,
    but considering it on the same level with South Korea under the military strongmen
    of the 1980s is simply wilful ignorance of nuances. South Koreans already had
    decades of experience in democratic elections and sporadic periods of genuine
    multi-party democracy (though eclipsed by longer periods of military authoritarian
    regimes) by the time the IOC awarded the 1988 games to Seoul.\r\n\r\nThere is
    also the difference in clout. South Koreans never have suffered from the illusion
    that they were a Great Power, immune to international pressure.\r\n\r\nI do worry
    that the current situation is only going to fan an us-vs-the-world sentiment in
    the Chinese population. Innocent athletes and visitors from other countries may
    well suffer, as the terrified Japanese fans during the 2004 Asian Cup football
    tournament found out after Japan beat China in the final in Beijing and the home
    fans rioted.\r\n\r\n<cite>As for the games, well, I hope China don\u2019t win
    the gold on Soccer (Foot-ball).</cite>\r\n\r\nI assure you, you can breathe easy
    on that one. ;-) Even the most resourceful dictatorships find it difficult to
    buy Football golds, unless you have world-class teams to start with (Italy 1934,
    Argentina 1978)."
