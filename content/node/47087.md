  was created in MS Volt. (Such as Arabic Typesetting)\r\nI used in it some glyphs
  didn't have Unicode code. Such as (Theh with Khah \u062B\u062E (.\r\n\r\nWhen I
  created a pdf file with Adobe Acrobat and open it in Adobe Reader or in Acrobat
  itself and try to search to theh with Khah \u062B\u062E, I didn\u2019t find it.\r\nAcrobat
  and some program can't find any glyph or a ligature didn't have a Unicode codepage.\r\nHow
  could I solve that?\r\nIf I give this glyph (ligature) a Unicode code from unicode
  private area, could I find it. Did Acrobat or other program support Private Area
  (UPA)?\r\nTo whom had Mac computer, shall we face the same problems.\r\n\r\nIf we
  used non Unicode fonts to create the pdf file and try to use search to any glyph,
  it didn't find anything. (It didn't find the base glyph such Jeem, beh \u2026 etc)

  body: "If glyphs in a font are named according to Adobe's <i>\"uniXXXXYYYY....\"</i>
    [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html |Glyph Naming Convention]]</a>
    then you can search in PDF files and cut and paste text from PDF to other applications
    since Acrobat can re-construct the Unicode characters of the original text by
    parsing the glyph names.  This works even for ligatures which do not correspond
    to a single Unicode code point and have no Unicode index in the font.\r\n\r\nIf
    glyphs in a complex script font are named in any other manner this doesn't work
    - so results will differ from font to font.\r\n\r\nI also don't know which non-Adobe
    PDF viewers support this.\r\n\r\n- Chris "
