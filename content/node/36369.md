  body: "I assume it's from one of the Grand Theft Auto games? Looks like it's designed
    to resemble text output by the Vectrex or similar\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex\r\n\r\nIt's
    so simple (only the M looks to diverge from the 2 x 2 grid, and that appears to
    be 3 x 2) that it might be easiest to just draw it... But on closer inspection
    many of the strokes fall short of baselines and caplines, perhaps to make it look
    a little more amateurish?"

  body: "This reminds me of Patric King's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pretty/smile/\">Smile</a>
    font. It has a sort of blur at the corners, especially in the light weights, that
    feels a lot like your sample. The M is the only structurally different letter
    at first glance. Squooshing (TM) would make the resemblance quite close.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Yes, and I thought with the glow effect and the font's thicker corners the
    effect would be enhanced. In any case, doesn't it seem likely that this was a
    custom font? This straight line sort of lettering requires virtually no skill
    to create, as evidenced by the number of them found on free download sites. \r\n\r\n-

  body: This is <em>not a font</em>. As Ray Larabie said above, he "drew that in Deluxe
    Paint." Only these characters were specifically drawn -- nothing else, nothing
    more. <em>There is no font.</em>

    mid 80s feel? That is attention to detail!
