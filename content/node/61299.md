  fonts can be used for commercial purposes.  For example, I have made some sweets
  at home and I would like to sell them but I will need to brand them e.g. packaging,
  leaflet, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    of course) can be used for commercial purposes, as most licensed fonts can. I
    am not 100% sure about the MS situation, but assume it is the same. '

  body: WHat you describe in your first post; packaging, leaflets, etc.  would all
    be considered business/personal use. Using the fonts to make documents. Commercial
    use, generally refers to including the font software in a commercial product,
    or having the font itself the major value of the product, such as plastic letters
    that are sold individually, or a t-shirt which uses a symbol from the font as
    its sole image.
