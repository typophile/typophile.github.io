  body: "Bookmania was not created until 2011 but there were other versions of Bookman
    in the 1970s that had these type of swashes. Not all made it into the digitized
    versions. The record designer would have had access to the pre-digital ITC Bookman
    Swash, now digitized as http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bookman/swash-medium-italic/glyphs.html
    and other similar fonts.\r\nDon't worry about differences in details. The practice
    was to photo-morph letters in many ways.\r\nBookmania includes the swashes available
    in the 70s and adds many more, so it's as good a choice as any to recreate something
    near the lettering.\r\nDon"

  body: We messed with Bookman Swash alot back in the seventies with photo setting
    - it was a fun one to distort in wild ways. We should point out you still can
    do that with PhotoShop and/or Illustrator.
