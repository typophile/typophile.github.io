  body: Thank you. It actualy have to be in the middle, readable and stylish. I have
    tried to make it irregural but client wanted to be this way. I dont have much
    expirience in graphic design (1 year) so typography is driving me crazy and i
    think this is quite difficult but i realy loved it. :-)

  body: "I didn't realize there was a client...\r\n\r\nIt's great to be ambitious,
    but unless you're naturally super-talented at type design or the client is willing
    to give you a great deal of time to learn the craft, you might be biting off more
    than you can chew (which the client probably doesn't realize). As you're saying
    yourself type design is harder than it looks from the outside, especially if you
    want to make a quality product.\r\n\r\nWhat's the worst that can happen? Well,
    you'll probably lose the possibility of future work. It might instead be better
    to subcontract somebody with more experience in type design: you would make less
    money, but would get a client willing to give you more work and recommend you
    to others. Think of it as a good way to start in this field. In fact collaboration
    often makes sense even for experienced type designers.\r\n\r\nYou will find many
    people on Typophile who can help you in this way, including yours truly: hpapazian
    at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nSome more advice: make sure you have a contract and get
    at least 1/3 of the total fee to start the project. Fonts are very easy to swipe
    with little risk of consequences.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    game or a print game?\r\nI think \"o\" is standing out too much; its thicks are
    heavy and its contrast angle is rather extreme."
