    to hendiadys.\r\n\r\nAlso, some people may have trouble associating sexuality
    with the nerd-factor of typography.\r\n\r\nBut you're right -- both indeed."

  body: 'The "journal of contemporary type" gag is a totally real but less in-your-face
    part of that li''l endeavor (the other themes are pretty obvious, really), since
    doing a little side project gives me a chance to work with some of my favorite
    typefaces made by some of my favorite folks, like [[http://www.typejockeys.com/fonts/Ingeborg|Ingeborg]]
    by the [[http://typejockeys.com|Typejockeys]], [[http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/maple/|Maple]]
    and [[http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/seravek/|Seravek]] by the [[http://processtypefoundry.com|Process
    Type Foundry]], the [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/studiolettering|Studio Lettering]]
    set from [[http://www.houseind.com|House Industries]], [[http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100003|Cyclone]]
    by [[http://typography.com|Hoefler & Frere-Jones]] and some beloved old gems that
    I rarely get to use otherwise, like [[http://www.linotype.com/284/cooperblack-family.html|Cooper
    Black]] and [[http://www.linotype.com/90269/stilla-family.html|Stilla]]. It even
    gives me an excuse to blow the cobwebs of my own (still unfinished, still unreleased)
    Gina family and  encourage me to keep at it. '
