body: "How can I restore all the kerning in a font. It's probably obvious for someone
  here, but I can't figure out to do it. I read in the FL manual that I have to press
  on the (icon) button and select the Reset Kerning command in the pop up menu. I
  see that icon in the toolbar but that button is in gray, so I can't press on. Your
  help will be appreciate. Is there an other way to restore all the kerning in a font?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    I wrote my comment. What I want to do is reset to zero value all the kerning.
    I want to delete all the kerning information. Sorry for my english.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    &gt; reset kerning" is disabled. Turn to the kerning mode (A|v).
