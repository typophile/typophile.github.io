  body: "I'm afraid that really isn't much to help us make an ID. Not even a way to
    be sure whether it's a serif or sans style. The other consideration is that considering
    the time period they may have hand-designed the numbers to make them into a die
    for stamping out these number plates. In other words, they may not even be based
    on a typeface.\r\n\r\nWhat is your goal? Would you only be interested in re-creating
    the numbers? It would help to see more numbers in order to have any chance of
    finding something similar. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    numbers 7 and 13A. I'm not sure the \"A\" is of the same style as the numbers.
    But maybe it helps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nr7v2_5702.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nr13Av2_6104.jpg]"
