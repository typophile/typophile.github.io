body: "Dear readers,\r\n\r\ni'm using an indesign script (not created by my, but from
  the internets) to output all glyphs of a font, identified by their Glyph ID (GID)
  in a document for comparison, testing and specimen. \r\n\r\nthe problem especially
  in the creation of a glyph list, while still bugfixing is: if i change my font,
  adding or deleting glyphs, and update the document with the new font version, the
  glyphs \"shift\" in their order: Let's say i had \"ABC\" inserted via their glyph
  indexes 100, 101, 102, and i then delete the glyphs 50 and 51 in my font file, the
  glyphs \"reshuffle\". So in the new version, the glyph numbers used by indesign
  of course stay the same, but they represent \"CDE\" now, resulting in a \"mess\"
  in my indesign glyph list :)\r\n\r\nI'm not working with unicode, as lots of my
  glyphs don't have one, but are alternates adressed by various opentype features.\r\n\r\nHow
  do you work in this problem? Any script to shift the GIDs in indesign too?  Do you
  have a way better approach when creating a glyph list in a layout program, while
  still working on the font?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nSebastian"

  body: Well certainly referencing GIDs is only going to lead to this problem. But
    as you noted, unicodes won't help. The only reference which would help in this
    situation would be for your script to refer to glyphs by glyph name. Unfortunately,
    I've reached the end of my InDesign knowledge here, and am not sure if that'd
    be even possible. :(

  body: "thank you  - i have come to that conclusion too ... the glyph name would
    be \"unique\" and independent from GID or unicode, but as far as i can see in
    glyph palette (and also from search tool for glyphs), it is not used by indesign.\r\n\r\nSo
    what i'd need is a script that looks for glyph IDs in the document, and add /
    subtract a value X to any GID it finds that is larger than Y (the position where
    i added / deleted a glyph) ... or accept that some of the work has to be done
    manually ;-)"

  body: "The GID is the <em>index</em> number of the character in the font itself,
    and so of course they shift when you remove a character ... You can't have a not-consecutive
    list of indexes.\r\n\r\nUnicode is a mapping from glyph index to a fixed code,
    so even when the glyph index itself changes, InDesign can still find the correct
    one. But if you rely on index alone, it cannot help you any further.\r\nThe same
    thing will happen when you change your font to another one: Unicode mapped characters
    will stay the same, un-mapped characters will change to the random glyph on that
    index position in the new font.\r\n\r\nEither don't insert or remove glyphs anymore
    (which should not be a problem, after all no software in the world works <em>solely</em>
    with glyph indexes), or assign Unicodes in the Private Range to your glyphs. The
    latter will ensure InDesign, as well as all other software, can keep up with your
    editing.\r\n\r\n(The former can be accomplished by leaving 'deleted' glyphs as
    blanks in their position, and only add new characters at the end.)"
