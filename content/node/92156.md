body: "Hello people of typophile! \r\n\r\nFirst of all, english is not my native language,
  so i hope not to make too much mistakes in my communication! I've been a reader
  of the forum for years, and by now I thought that my first post would have been
  for the release of a typeface, but nope.. not yet...\r\n\r\nI'm designing a display
  typeface and I want to include a small set of ornaments, many of them to build frames,
  borders, divisions and patterns. So for example, let's say i have 4 glyphs that
  make for the corners of a frame (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right)
  and the glyphs for the borders between the corners; then, is there any common disposition
  of them in the keyboard? I couldn't find info for this. Tried to find user's guide
  from the foundries explaining to the final user how to build the borders using fonts
  like that. I don't own any font of the kind.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is some common used
  encoding for these symbols. Besides frames and borders, I have tiles for making
  background patterns and decorative elements for the begining and end of a text line.\r\n\r\nI
  hope someone could point me in the right direction, and hope i wasn't confusing
  so you can understand me!\r\n\r\nGreetings and thanks for reading.\r\n\r\nGabriel "

    borders. There are a lot of discussions, though.\r\n\r\nThere used to be an Opentype
    feature for Ornaments, but I think there is so little support for it, it quietly
    got ditched. See <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/67288\">Open Type Ornaments
    in Indesign? (How to)</a> for some sample OTF code for this (and additional remarks
    on using them in InDesign), and <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/58707\">Opentype
    Access to unencoded ornaments & dingbats</a> for comments on a designer with the
    same question.\r\n\r\nAs for <em>encoding</em>, you can (a) use 'alternates' for
    various characters -- a..z, for example -- to 'switch on' your borders, (b) use
    a single alternate to access all of them -- the bullet seems to be Adobe's preferred
    catch-all --, although this has various related drawbacks (esp. when using InDesign
    -- see <a href=\"http://forums.adobe.com/thread/880342\">Adobe Forum: Opentype
    ornaments</a> for a complaint related with this method), or (c) assign unique
    Unicodes to your ornaments (it's up to you whether or not to assign unique Unicode
    codes, as this has no effect on any Opentype features you might want to add to
    support your ornaments).\r\n\r\nIf you do assign Unicodes, then use the PUA range
    for this. If an application does not support the OTF feature you use, and you
    did not assign Unicodes, there is no way to get your borders into a document!\r\nThe
    PUA range is the \"Private Use Area\" (or sth. similar); you can assign whatever
    character you like to the code range U+E000..U+F8FF.  Adobe's Thomas Phinney's
    (2006) thoughts on using the PUA for ornaments (<a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/05/eliminate_priva.html\">Eliminate
    Private Use Encoding in Revised Fonts?</a>):\r\n<blockquote>About the only thing
    we\u2019d use PUA for in new fonts would be ornaments or dingbats that really
    don\u2019t have their own codepoints.</blockquote>\r\n.. followed by a list of
    comments six times longer than his thoughts ;-)"

  body: "Thank you both for your replies! I feel like a dork for using the word 'coding'.
    I edited the post, changed it to 'encoding'. Thanks Theunis.\r\n\r\nInteresting
    Nick, I guess it's up to the designer then to choose the \"logical\" way to arrange
    the elements in play, so it makes some sense for the user.\r\n\r\nSomehow I thought
    that every alternate had to be be placed in the PUA, those kind of things you
    learn once and repeat forever.\r\nReading Theunis reply makes me realize it's
    taken for granted that these ornaments should be included in the one and only
    final OTF file. But, I wonder: is it anachronistic to deliver the borders and
    ornaments in a separate file? Is it a \"don't\" by today standards? Otherwise
    I feel those treats would be kinda buried in the font, which will probably have
    its own set of alphabetic alternates as well.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nGabriel"

  body: "Gabriel,\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about having them in the same font is that
    it would be one less font to worry about. Not to mention the fact that most of
    the separate fonts use code points assigned to other symbols (i.e. a = left upper
    corner), if the font is changed, than the characters are changed. Also, if the
    characters aren't converted to outlines, I assume, the final output (if it were
    a PDF), would have the borders be searchable characters in the document.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if it's in the same font, you can use the CALT or one of the SS features to transform
    something like \"<---~~-->\" into an ornament.\r\n\r\nI'm working on this issue
    myself as I'm making my first typeface which includes borders. I'm planning on
    keeping the ornaments in the same font and use the CALT method. I'm not sure if
    I'll be using the PUA or not, once I've done some more testing I'll make that
    decision."
