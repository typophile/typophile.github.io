body: I have a headache because I can&#39;t find out what this font is. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  been told to &#34;ask in around in the forums at typophile - they seem to know every
  font on earth.&#34; so that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. <BR> <BR>I have a logo at
  <A HREF="http://www.johnblackbourn.com/game2.gif" TARGET="_top">http://www.johnblackbourn.com/game2.gif</A>
  and I could really do with knowing what the font is. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve had no luck
  at WhatTheFont or Identifont, so if anyone here has an idea, please let me know!
  <BR> <BR>Many thanks in advance! :D

    in about 10 minutes. Along with the other characters. It seems to be an amalgamation
    &#40;sp&#41; of several different OCR fonts. :&#124; '

    <BR> <BR>I confess - I don&#39;t know what it is. <BR> <BR>Why not try <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily137.html"

  body: ' Re Tiffany - My needs are to be able to create page headings etc for a new
    website using the same font as the logo. <BR> <BR>Re Stephen - I know it&#39;s
    horrible and ugly, but my client paid a lot of money getting it made by a &#42;professional&#42;
    logo designer and he really doesn&#39;t want to discard it. Fool, I dare say.
    <BR>I have a font called OCR-A-Extended which is about the nearest to it. <BR>
    <BR>It never occured to me it could be a mixture of fonts or characters; I think
    I may have to settle with OCR. <BR> <BR>Ta <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Actually, there is a font. The &#39;designer&#39; gave the public plenty of
    nice ones but, unfortunately, was responsible for this travesty as well. Who?
    Ray Larabie. <BR> <BR>The font is Plasmatic. <BR><A HREF="http://www.larabiefonts.com/fonts/p.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.larabiefonts.com/fonts/p.html</A> <BR> <BR>Probably too
    late for John B, but I&#39;ll e-mail him. Just thought I&#39;d tie up a loose
