body: 'Hello to the board! <BR> <BR>I always wondered during the last days what kind
  of entry present I could offer to the typophile community. Well, I just had been
  working on a logo for a mineral water and the client &#40;like always&#41; took
  one of those alternatives I did not really favorise. So I sadly looked at MY best
  version, my darling, meditated over it for some minutes and suddenly saw that there
  could be some glyphs hidden in the geometry. Mmmmh, I thought, I can also WRITE
  with it &#40;if one can read it is another question&#41;... <BR> <BR>Now I want
  to present the result to your critical eyes: a desktop in two sizes &#40;1,280 and
  1,024&#41; that I will upload to the desktop gallery. In case it does not arrive
  there or gets delayed somehow, everybody can also see it and download it from my
  homepage in  <BR><A HREF="www.matthiasnicolai.com/code1280.html" TARGET="_blank">
  1280</A> or <A HREF="www.matthiasnicolai.com/code1024.html" TARGET="_blank"> 1024</A>
  format. <BR> <BR>I truelly look forward to your feedback but have a bit mercy with
  a design newby like me. <BR> <BR>THANKS. MAT'

    have. it&#39;s so alien, but it can be deciphered relatively easily. interesting,
