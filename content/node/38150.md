body: Can anyone recommend the best way to set up a 20-ft long banner in Illustrator?
  Is it to layout the banner at 10-ft and then have it printed at 200%?

  body: Yes, just do everything at double resolution (if there are any raster effects)
    and tell your printer it's a 20-foot banner.

  body: "When designing signs it is best to work at full scale, but if your software
    can't handle it, you do what you have to do to get it done. \r\n\r\nFlexiSign
    is better than Illustrator for this purpose, but it is also outrageously expensive
    and dongle-bound."

  body: I agree. Working at 100% eliminates another variable for those doing the production.
    I've had to produce signs at smaller sizes before, however, and find myself being
    incredibly careful and giving clear instructions to my rep and the production
    people. As long as you sign off on a PO or Work Order that agrees with what you
    need to end up with you should be, ok. But, you see, the word "should" scares
    me to death. I've been known to call people twice to make sure we are on the same
    page.

  body: "I just did a series of billboards that were anywhere from 40' to 62' feet
    wide in Illy. With large signage call the printer and find out what they want
    you to do and then deliver it.\r\n\r\nI have worked from 1/48 scale in Illy to
    full scale in Photoshop and everywhere in between.\r\n\r\nGood communication with
    the vendor will get you there.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "I've done many large format signs in Illustrator, and it's important that
    you talk directly with the printer before proceeding.  Depending on the media
    and the printer, you may encounter major problems with certain design elements.
    \r\n\r\nOn duratrans material, for example, I've seen vector gradients print as
    choppy stripes, depending on the printer.  There are tricks to resolve this, but
    only the printer knows how to fix it -- and if it can be fixed. Sometimes it can't
    be fixed, so it's better to know beforehand and design around the caveats.\r\n\r\nGood
    Luck!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.eileenburke.org\">Eileen Burke Graphic Design</a>"
