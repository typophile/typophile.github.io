  body: "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nthis is Viva.\r\n\r\n<cite>Viva is the work of California
    designer [[Carol Twombly]]. It is a [[multiple master]] typeface with weight and
    width axes that allow variations of Viva to be generated by the user. Viva\u2019s
    weight axis can be thought of as a shadow axis: as the weight increases, the design
    casts a longer shadow in a weight range from light to bold. The width axis ranges
    from condensed to extra-extended. </cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/48078/vivalightextraextended-font.html#info\">
