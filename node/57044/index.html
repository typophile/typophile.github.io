<p>What are the type designer/vendor options? To offer a demo/free font, with some (important) glyphs missing? Some kind of devolution policy?</p>
<p>And what are the user options? To buy a single weight, prove it, and only buy the complete family if it works fine? To check if some friend already has the font, go to his/her computer and prove it there?</p>

<p>Back in the old days, you only had a printed catalog to go on, and had to mark up typewritten text to send it off to the typesetter. Then you had to wait until the proofs came back, and mark up corrections &ndash; or, if the text was too long, have an editor mark up enough lines to shorten the text &ndash; and send it back to the typesetter for another round&hellip;</p>
<p>My point is that we designers have it pretty easy these days, and we have several ways of testing a face before we hit the &ldquo;Buy&rdquo; button.</p>

<p>Yep, but since a good foundry font costs much more than a beer Cristobal&rsquo;s question doesn&rsquo;t sound so out of place. A couple of foundry who offers font fot trial, in different ways:</p>
<p>Underware. You can buy for 10 euro the Dolly specimen book, which comes with a cd with the font, fully working. Then if you decide to use the font professionally, you have to buy the full license.
<a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&amp;id2=overview">http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&amp;id2=overview</a></p>
<p>B&amp;P Type Foundry. You can download their fonts for free, but with limited glyphs - just to test them in layouts.
<a href="http://www.bpfoundry.com/fonts/fonts.htm">http://www.bpfoundry.com/fonts/fonts.htm</a></p>
<p>That said, there are some independent type designers who are very friendly and can help the buyer in deciding if the their font is suitable for him, even setting a test-layout, then sending the pdf to him.</p>
<p>Also, a way to see the fonts in use, though only on screen, is using the search function in Google Books (with the font name in the search field or a search phrase like &ldquo;set in [typeface name])&rdquo;.</p>

<p>FWIW, as a not-yet-so-very-experienced designer, I appreciate such offers a lot.
Whereas display/headline stuff is nicely covered by the type testers of this world, with text fonts I often find it very hard (if not impossible) to tell if they&rsquo;ll work, and what kind of color and mood they&rsquo;ll bring to my layout.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that as far as the hoops we had to jump through to get type set (what Ricardo summarized), things are much more convenient now for designers.</p>
<p>But with regards to evaluating a typeface before investing in it, there were some resources of the old days that have slipped away, not adequately replaced by most current methods.</p>
<p>Where text types are concerned, an old printed catalog might have page after page of a given typeface set in a variety of sizes and leadings and even measures, in adequate paragraphs to truly judge the overall color and fit. Some large composing houses produced entire books of text showings &ndash; cf. Kingsport, in three volumes. And, most importantly, they were <em>printed.</em></p>
<p>It seems that in this digital age, there are plenty of opportunities for designers to see how typefaces <em>look,</em> but perhaps not quite as many opportunities to judge how they <em>perform.</em></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you so much for all your answers. I see I’m not the only guy thinking like this.</p>
<p>I know it’s not an easy question, and I am not asking only from the typographer side: I do type design as well (custom fonts, mostly; first commercial family by the end of the year).</p>
<p>Since fonts are being compared here to beers and paid-sex, I suppose I am allowed to do more “apples to oranges” comparisons:</p>
<p>—When you want to buy a new car, they let you drive it first. Full functionality, limited time.
—Demos in software are very common. Full functionality, but limited time. Or limited functionality, unlimited time.
—If I go to the bookstore, most of the times I like to read some paragraphs or even a few pages of the book I am interested in. I don’t see anything bad on this. Full functionality, limited time.</p>
<p>My point is: a good typeface family is not cheap. As a typographer, I would like to know better if I am doing a good decision by choosing this or that. I am not trying to get everything by free. On the other hand, as a type designer, I want that people who will (hopefully) buy my fonts, is happy and not angry because they bought something that don’t fit their needs. But I don’t want give my work for free, either.</p>
<p>That’s why this question comes to my mind over and over. I’m just trying to get the best for everyone. That’s it. And, thanks to your answers, I see there are more options out there.</p>

Makes it difficult. And to have different demo versions would put a lot of hassles on the vendors shoulders, and might make it so the wrong sort could build a cracked version.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a programmer, but I don&rsquo;t know of any way to time-release a font, and even if it happened, your customers would screw you up by asking for a modification in the sample you sent out five weeks ago (and now the demo has died). Unlimited time release demos are self defeating again.</p>

<p>Actually, sii, one of the bars I frequent lets you try a small amount of beer before you buy anything. It&rsquo;s kind of like how in an ice cream shop they&rsquo;ll give you a taster spoon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that this is the best model for fonts, though. Most retailers have great ways to test out headline faces, since you can use the &ldquo;Test Drive&rdquo; feature on MyFonts, H&amp;FJ, vllg, Veer, FontShop, etc., take a screen shot, and place it in your document. But the tools for testing extended text types are limited, as Kent was saying. Perhaps foundries could have a tool where you specify line length, point size, leading, and a variety of other parameters, and it spits out a page of lorem ipsum in PDF format for you to print. It&rsquo;s not a perfect tool, but it would certainly help.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all on the retailers. Retailers that want to market their fonts well have been introducing increasingly complex and useful tools for sampling fonts before you buy them. I think that it&rsquo;s only a matter of a few years before MyFonts or FontShop or someone else releases something like this.</p>

For a body text you could leave out a few letters and simply replace them with a no-width space, or even a similar letter.  E.g. kill the w for a v and the m for an n.  Makes it useless for a text font but visually testing it it won&rsquo;t change much.  Or caps especially, since they are what?  1% of the letters we use, but won&rsquo;t interrupt the flow of a sentence for testing.  For a display font, you could even mark up a few glyphs with a small slash cut.  Yeah, someone could just edit the splines, but if they&rsquo;re going to go to that much work they&rsquo;re also just going to trace an image sample or edit splines on a PDF sample.</p>

—No figures, no kerning.</p>
<p>For text fonts, that would be enough to give a good idea of its performance (how much pages will my text need to fit?, for example), and, on the other hand, this way the font lacks of some important glyphs needed to set real texts (figures, for example).</p>
<p>I know there’s no perfect solution, either: what if you need precisely to test the figures? Anyway, I think this would work most of the times for the majority of users (and that is a good deal for me).

<blockquote>
<p><cite>A carpenter can’t hammer a nail without buying a decent hammer either.
</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with you on this point: you must buy the best tools you can. And I do. I am just wondering if it is a good idea to let the carpenter to test the hammer before he buys (in this case, I assume the carpenter goes to the store and watch it, handle it, compare it with other hammers and just after that he pays it). He doesn’t want to steal the hammer, he wants to buy it.</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe it is not a good idea. Maybe it is better that the carpenter don’t touch the hammer before he pays. Maybe he should buy the hammer even if it doesn’t work so he can learn, and the next time he won’t buy that kind of hammers again (or he won’t buy in that store again, for that matter). Is this really the best for everybody?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>Remember the ol’ days when it was printers and type setters who owned type instead of designers?</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I don’t remember those days. I wasn’t there: my first professional job was in 2000. And many typographers, increasing every year, are in the very same situation. And maybe because I live on this evil internet age, I really appreciate to test things before I buy them (NOT instead, at least not in my case). I assume some other people, including some typographers who didn’t know the old days, will think like this. They don’t care how difficult those days were; they care about solving their problems today.</p>
<p>If I could test the fonts, as I do with some other products, that would be great for me as a customer, since I can take more informed decisions, even if it is glyph-limited. (If it is a bad idea, it is OK, I was just wondering.) But I am a type designer as well, and I want to be someone who help their potential customers as much as I can, even if that means that someone will test my product and finally don’t buy. (Maybe it is a bad marketing idea, too.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think of this age as necessarily evil (or that the internet is evil, either). Like any other technology, it has good and bad qualities. And I can relate to what you say: I much prefer to go to a bookstore and thumb through a book before I put down some hard-earned cash to pay for it. I don&rsquo;t like buying things without looking at them, either. I might get stuck with something bad and regret my purchase.</p>
<p>But what you <em>can</em> do with the internet is educate yourself as much as you can about something before buying it. You can read descriptions and reviews of what is available, you can even find user forums and see if people are happy with product X &ndash; or not. And as far as typefaces are concerned, in addition to setting some text online, you can request printed specimens from many foundries, who will be happy to put you on their mailing list.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i agree with nick, most times i only really know the right typeface was used after the job has come back from the printers. i then decide how i can use the typface better next time, or if another one is needed.</p>
<p>i purchased the stag family last year, and after using it many times in various settings i believe i am only just now getting used to it enough to set it just right, so it can take time to make the most of a typeface.</p>
<p>so at some point, you just have to dive in and buy the thing, then see if it works. the great thing is that even if it doesn&rsquo;t work first time, you then have a working knowledge of it and so can find the right place for it next time. my work purchased the neutraface family, so as part of me getting used to it, i set an entire book with it. it was a challenge, but i now understand that typeface so much more (and it actually worked quite well).</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve noticed that quite a few foundries will set a few pages for you in the desired typeface and send you the pdf to print out, which i think is a fair compromise.</p>

<p>In a past comment, you implied that sample font won’t be useful if it doesn’t contain some basic letter (“It i• very u•seful…”). If I say that you may include all the upper and lowercase, you say anglophonic designers can use it <em>as it is</em> and don’t pay for it “as long as they don’t use any French” (so, if I understand you right, you are telling that this limited-glyph font would be enough for anglophonic users). But, on the other hand, as it doesn’t have any kerning, you say it doesn’t work for testing the font performance (except for anglophonic users, right?).</p>
<p>—About kerning: I think kerning is important in a text font, but not essential in order to test it, given it has a good tracking. In addition: if you really think kerning is <em>that</em> important, I don’t see why don’t include in it, because it will contain only kerning pairs of the letters you put in the sample (not enough for real texts). Or it may include only the most important kerning values, or whatever.</p>
<p>—About upper and lowercase: upper and lowercase complete is not enough for a text font: even anglophonic users need to write sometimes names like François Mitterrand or César Chávez. And they certainly need the figures (not included).</p>
<p>But I suppose you are going to tell me now that anglophonic users may use it in this crippled condition, “as long as they don’t use any figures” (twenty-four instead of 24), and that a font without figures doesn’t give “any idea about a font’s performance”…</p>

<p>I think a limited character (full alphabet upper &amp; lower w/o diacriticals or extended character sets) is a very generous way to see how the font will look in use. Honestly, you can&rsquo;t have everything, and you don&rsquo;t need the accents in order to see if you like the font (plus you CAN see them in a pdf). It&rsquo;s a test drive after all. A lot of softwares offer this sort of deal - beta or free trial version and then you pay to unlock the complete application. Makes perfect sense to me. I wish this were more readily available.</p>
<p>It would also be useful in terms of showing the client a sample so you can get approval before purchasing the font.</p>

<p>Good deal for me, too: if it doesn’t work, I haven’t lost a fortune. And I can use it later, anyway.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Cristobal, my problem with the limited-glyph font proposal it that there are lots of potential uses for a font, where the lack of numerals and accents would be no impediment: a logo, banner, headline, ad and other short stuff. On the other hand, to evaluate the performance of a font in a text context: magazine, newspaper, book, journal, I would still hold that kerning would be essential, for both aesthetic evaluation and, say, for the purposes of a cast-off or copy-fitting. I would much rather spend some time setting someone&rsquo;s text in one of my fonts to spec as a courtesy example, rather then spending the time artificially crippling the fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For Bloodtype: I don&rsquo;t see anything weird in having the full stop after the closing guillemets, though I have seen the period inside the quotes, for example, when a character speaks in a novel:</p>
<p>Alice: &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to go among mad people.&rdquo;
The Cat: &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t help that. We&rsquo;re all mad here. I&rsquo;m mad. You&rsquo;re mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, going back to the subject of this thread, for sure the best way to judge a font is having it printed in high resolution by a professional service. But a helpful way for a typesetter to better understand how a font works (and not just how it looks), could be having some &ldquo;typical&rdquo; double page spread (a novel, an essay with footnotes and quotation, a poetry book), printable in A4. A thing that, in my opinion (and from my limited experience), most of the pdfs available in foundries' site don&rsquo;t do. For example, one of the reason I decided to buy a license for Whitman was the pdf made by Kent Lew, which somehow resembles a typical book-situation. I&rsquo;m speaking of setting texts in books here.</p>
<p>Now about the limited glyphs matter: I don&rsquo;t think that anybody could use such a font for a professional layout (besides logo and titling, maybe) - I have made a pdf test with the free BP Romain and even an English text shows problems (no numerals, wrong accent). Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t attach it here. Anyway, if Cristobal decides to go with it for his Espinosa and Fondo (which look very nice, by the way), I think that they should have kerning enabled; otherwise they&rsquo;re useless.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Nicola on the printable A4. Being able to print fonts and check them out first where they shine best, may it be books, magazines, or newspapers, is always a plus. It&rsquo;s just difficult to reproduce the production processes involved, like how newspapers are printed.</p>
<p>I am still up for the high-resolution (or variable-resolution) <em>bitmap</em> PDF generator. There is no risk of extracting the embedded font files, and the user can see if the font/s look good under conditions within his or her control.</p>
<p>For other type-tasting options, Type Together&rsquo;s is a pleasant deal.</p>

<p>That felt good, Nicola.</p>
<p>Actually, I am doing more weights for Fondo at the moment, but those will remain, as the first weights, for the exclusive use of the Fondo de Cultura Económica. Yes, I know, I know, it is sad…</p>
<p>But I really think that the new Espinosa is going to be better than Fondo (at least that’s the way I see it). It is completely redrawn. Hopefully you can see something about Espinosa in the next few months. And no, I don’t know yet if it is going to be in the form of a limited-glyph font. :P</p>

<p>Of course, the beer doesn&rsquo;t come with a BS contract purporting to limit to what you can do with the beer. You can do anything with it unless prohibited by law.</p>
<p>If you want to modify (or fortify!) your beer, you can. But a font, you can copy free for private study, because the legislation says it&rsquo;s ok.</p>

<p>Which means, if not integrating the system in the OS, which could be averted by compiling your own Gentoo build, among others, that this will result in an expiry date bundled with the font, in which a way is to incorporate a software that automatically destroys any expired fonts; thus, we&rsquo;re treading the path of font DRM.</p>
