  body: "This isn't so much a drop shadow as it is an extrusion with an outline. I'd
    guess from the look and feel of the reference material, that this is predating
    contemporary design tools. 1.) You could draw it, so you could have a better understanding
    of what is going on. 2.) You can do a standard drop, and \"connect your diagonal
    endpoints\"... 3.) There's a 3D tool within illustrator that will support this
    kitsch niche... I've been using it quite a lot lately to both devalue and inflate
    the importance of some personal maxims... \r\n\r\n(i.e. see my colourlovers link
    in my profile.)"

  body: "The way I would do that is in Illustrator.\r\n\r\n1: Type your word/line
    of text.\r\n\r\n2: Create Outlines.\r\n\r\n3: Do an \"Offset Path\" under objects.
    Play around with this until you get the right weight around your text.\r\n\r\n4:
    Take the background shadow element you just created, copy it, and paste it in
    back, moving it down and to the right, or whichever way you want. This is going
    to define how far out your shows will go.\r\n\r\n5: Go to \"Blend>Blend Options,\"
    choose \"Number of Steps,\" and put in something pretty high, like 100. Select
    the shadow piece in back of your text, and the one you moved down and to the right,
    and go to \"Blend>Make Blend.\" If it's too stepped, undo it and go back to blend
    options, setting the value higher.\r\n\r\n6: Use the Pathfinder tool to combine
    the shadow into one simple piece.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's at least how I would do it.
    There are several other ways you could go about it, but that one is the quickest.
    Sorry if all the functions are not exactly the right name -- I'm not looking at
    Illustrator right now -- but it should give you a general idea of what to play
    with."

  body: "Brock-the funny thing is that it's a type example from LHF Garner. I was
    hoping it looked like a 1950's sign, so from what you've said, I'm on the right
    track! Also, thank you for pointing me in the direction of colourlovers-what a
    great site! \r\n\r\nI'm going to try your lesson and that of Feelthekern. Also
    Ben, I've put your book on my need-to-purchase list. \r\n\r\nThank you so much
    for your help. Since I posted my first question about how to distinguish one sans
    font from the other, I feel like I'm back in college. With everyone's help here
    at Typophile, I've learned more about fonts than I knew in my four years working
    at my publisher. I've learned from every book mentioned, every website suggestion,
    every bit of advice, and appreciate all of your knowledge. "

    the easiest for someone who is not too skilled in Illustrator. \r\n\r\nIvan-thanks

  body: Glad that worked out for you! One thing that can make it a lot smoother is
    once you've flattened the background shadow pieces into one shape, select all
    the points except for the far left and far right (or highest and lowest, depending
    on what kind of shadow you created), hit backspace, and then do an Apple+J "Join"
    command. Do this step for both sides with a lot of extra points. This gets rid
    of any of the stepping from the blending process, but if you used enough steps,
    it won't be visible. It will create a very large file, though, if you leave the
    steps.

  body: Oh it doesn't need to be live text-I can do it from outlines. I know that
    the artist only uses illustrator from reading one of her interviews. Does it being
    outlines change your answer (I hope!)

    the letters (shapes)\r\n2. Paste in place (command-F) to make a copy of the letters
    directly on top\r\n3. Offset the copy in the direction and distance you want the
    shadow to go\r\n4. Make the color of the original letters darker (the color you
    want the shadow to be)\r\n5. Select both the copy and the original and apply the
    Pathfinder \"Minus Front\" operation -- this is your shadow\r\n6. Do a paste behind
    (command-B) to paste the original letters behind the shadow (the original letters
    should still be on the clipboard)\r\n\r\nHere is what it looks like:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/innershadow_5964.gif]\r\n\r\nLeft

    The closest I came was this http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/illustration/making-a-tuts-style-shield-in-illustrator/\r\n\r\n...not
    exactly as simple as your tutorial. I'm just about to try it so thanks again.
    By the way-love your blog and lesson on how to spot Arial. I will never mistake
    Arial for Helvetica again :o)"
