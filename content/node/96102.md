body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iskra6_3966.gif]\r\n\r\nA practical sans
  serif need not appear dry, constructed, or derivative. It can excel in its sensible
  role and yet possess a distinct flair. [[http://www.type-together.com/Iskra|Iskra]]
  (spark or flash) is a new sans serif designed by Tom Grace.\r\n\r\nIt was conceived
  to challenge the limits between utilitarian and decorative. Sporting a low-contrast
  profile, it is a study of bridled energy in the Cyrillic and Latin scripts. Its
  eye-catching forms are an oblique tribute to the less-predictable style of brush
  lettering, and contain daring, elegant curves, economical proportions, and a slight
  top-heavy asymmetry. Its warmth comes from the subtle emphasis on the structures
  and details of individual letterforms, whereas its solidity is demonstrated through
  its balanced rhythm over long spans of text.\r\n\r\nEach font supports over 75 languages
  and is hand-tuned for a pleasing legibility and aesthetic both in print and on screen.
  This type family makes an excellent choice for presentations, articles, branding,
  and advertising. Available in 14 styles, Iskra represents a fresh, stimulating,
  forward-looking perspective on how we see both the vitality of the particular letter
  and the overall harmony of text. [[http://www.type-together.com/Iskra|Iskra]] is
  available in three different character repertoires: Iskra, complete set \u2014 Iskra
  CYR, Cyrillic-based subset with a Latin supplement \u2014 Iskra LAT, Latin-based
  subset.\r\nBoth the LAT and CYR series conform to most standard codepages used by
  typical software covering their respective scripts. All three series have similar
  OpenType functionality.\r\n\r\n<strong>more information:</strong> [[http://www.type-together.com/Iskra]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iskra1_4258.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iskra2_4799.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iskra3_5260.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iskra5_5034.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iskra4_4663.gif]"

    low? I know it's important to make it distinctive from the 't', but I thought
    the bar was supposed to be higher to avoid spacing issues. But, having no knowledge
    of Polish typographic customs, I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, what unicode
    number, if any, did you put your ruble sign at?"
