  as strong as possible, I have created a tag-line for myself. <em>Reliable creative</em>.\r\n\r\nI
  will use the logo with the tag-line on my website and promotional material, where
  as the MK logo is already in place on my business cards and letterhead, so that
  can not be modified at this point, although a critique on that would be great as
  well.\r\n\r\nDoes the logo look proportional? Does it reflect <em>reliable creative</em>?\r\n\r\nYour
  critique is appreciated.\r\n[logo attached]"

  body: "Reliable creative is a little small right now, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTry
    to make it (a little) bigger, so the it shows you're proud of being reliable and
    creative.\r\n\r\nAnd the logo looks reliable, because it's got a bit of  seriousness
    to it. But I guess it could be more \"creative\".\r\n\r\nAlso, the image you posted
    was small and the logo was kind of cut off, try leaving some space next time (like
    a white border).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you want to get all conceptual, the 'M' teetering on the stem of the 'K'
    suggests instability, imbalance, etc. If they were vertically stacked (with care),
    that would help to communicate 'reliability'.\r\n\r\nTo make the overall logo
    more creative, you could use a script (or your handwriting/signature) for one
    of the letters (probably the 'm').\r\n\r\nI like the shade of red you've picked
    as well as the font.\r\n\r\n.[.kyle.]."

  body: "I have a problem with the slogan. Reliable Creative, implies anyone else
    is unreliable, a negitive for the industry. It creates a red flag (your logo)
    don't trust anybody in the graphic arts.\r\n\r\nI could see it now IBM, Reliable
    Computers (I don't think so)"

  body: "While I disagree with some of what Dan is saying, I do agree that specifically
    stating \"reliable\" seems odd.\r\n\r\nAs for the visual aspects, the 'Reliable
    Creative' is a bit small, and I'm not a fan of how the 'M' makes the upper left
    side of the box feel a bit askew. It's not a reason to not use the logo, it's
    just something that bugs me. Consider aligning the top of your name with the top
    of the 'K', as well.\r\n\r\nIt's a clean, fairly attractive logo, but it doesn't
    shout 'creative' to me and isn't very memorable. However, it does have a calmer
    feel that could be interpreted as experienced/reliable. I'm not your target audience
    though, and they may respond to this with more interest than I do."

  body: "First off, thanks for the feedback thus far.\r\n\r\nI've reworked the size
    and placement of my name and Reliable Creative. The increase in size of the latter
    was much needed. <a href=\"http://www.designbymk.com/MK_logo_with_tag.gif\">Link
    to updated logo</a>. (Is there a better way to actually show an image on this
    forum?)\r\n\r\nKyle: I had not seen the teetering until you pointed it out. That's
    something I will definitely keep in mind and might start playing with some modified
    concepts.\r\n\r\nDaniel and Chris: The idea behind Reliable Creative is that I'm
    an art director that consistently meets deadlines and produces professional work
    that will fulfill the project goals. Unfortunately not everyone in the graphic
    arts is reliable, but it's something I take pride in and is a personal selling
    point.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to say that I am the only reliable creative in the
    industry, because you know that's not the case. I would just like to harness that
    as my unique selling point. \r\n\r\nJust a note on my target audience, I'm specifically
    targeting creative directors, creative department heads, and similar positions
    in ad/graphic design agencies."

  body: "Mike, \r\nIf you changed the strap to Reliably Creative you could make a
    nice play on words without losing your USP. I feel you could expand the letters
    further to create a logo which can still be read. On your new logo the strap line
    is not visually aligned to the left of your name, while your name is not aligned
    with the top of the mark.\r\nTim"

    you of this, although calling it your 'unique selling point' does seem to say
    that. The concern is not how we percieve you, but rather how your intended audience
    percieves you as a result of this approach.\r\n\r\nI have to throw my vote in
    with Dan and Chris; calling yourself a \"Reliable Creative\" is sort of like a
    used car dealer calling himself a \"Trustworthy Salesman\"--e.g, it only means
    you were in some doubt to begin with. :)\r\n\r\n<em>\"In Bean's experience, anyone

  body: The updated logo looks like three different styles and ideas fighting against
    each other for attention. I would lose the square with the initials. The contrast
    between the two fonts looks odd in the square. The font used for your name reads
    as "reliable, dependable and I think the previous suggestion of using a signature
    with a qoute of "creativity on time" is brilliant. Whats your secret for meeting
    deadlines? Being creative...I'm alwase one day behind and apologizing for all
    my RUSH print jobs... I can only drink so much coffee and diet coke...let me in
    on your secrets!

  body: Hmmm, I'm not as knowledgable as the above few, but the difference in size
    betweent the M and K just seems a little off. either try to use a different letter
    style or make the leters the same size, but all-n-all it looks good. A very professional
    logo.
