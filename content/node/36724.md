  body: "Do you guys read what I read on that website? \"Plus sized\"? \"Full figured\"?
    What's this nonsense!?! These are <em>regular</em> women with <em>normal</em>
    bodies, fer crying out loud!!!\r\n\r\nArgh, this is driving me friggin' <em>NUTS,</em>
    how these marketing leeches and fashion fascists suceed in making women think
    they are 'big' as soon as they don't look like anorexic boy-girls. Women are <em>supposed</em>
    to have breast and hips and tummies and butts! That's what makes them beautiful
    and soft and huggable; that's one of the reasons why we friggin' <em>love</em>
    them so much! Argh!!!\r\n\r\nwheeze wheeze pant pant\r\n\r\nSorry people, rant
    over... Won't happen again. :^/"

  body: "Yves,\r\n\r\nYou should read a little more into the site. This is a company
    that celebrates women--much in support of what you are saying. Read a few of the
    testimonials. I think you have spoken too soon.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you for the ID."

  body: "Darn, I came across all wrong. Sorry about the confusion.\r\n\r\nI wasn't
    reacting against this specific website at all but against the global situation
    which forces this website to market itself like this. It's not the website that's
    wrong, on the contrary, it is the general perception of the female body in today's
    hyperconsumerist atmosphere that's totally f***ed up. I mean, <a href=\"www.thebratzfilm.com/\">Bratz</a>
    anyone?"
