body: Does anybody know a Python search & replace script, with the help of which I
  can comment the output of TTX, the name table for example? It should understand
  regular expressions and keywords for new lines.

  body: "To comment out the name table, you need only  replace <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>
    with <code>&lt;!-- &lt;name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/name&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;/name&gt;
    --&gt;</code>. If <code>fin</code> is the input file and <code>fout</code> the
    output, then\r\n<code>\r\nintext=fin.read()\r\nfout.write(\"%s\" % intext.replace('&lt;name&gt;',
    '&lt;!-- &lt;name&gt;').replace('&lt;/name&gt;', '&lt;/name&gt; --&gt;'))\r\n</code>\r\ndoes
    the job.\r\n\r\nIf you have many substitutions and you want to perform them in
    one pass, then regular expressions may be useful indeed. <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/recipes/81330-single-pass-multiple-replace/\"><strong>This
    link</strong></a> discusses how that can be done.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\nAdded:
    you need <code>from string import replace</code>.\r\n"

  body: "@ Michel\r\n\r\nThanks. I want to explain the meaning of the namerecords
    and a few other things in the dumped TTX file. And remember, I don\u2019t know
    anything about Python. I am searching for a script like this: \"http://sourceforge.net/projects/csart/\".
    But it does not support regular expressions. And I also need a keyword for inserting
    new lines. The Python script shall be started from a batch file, in which is defined,
    what shall be replaced by what."

  body: I am unaware of ready to use scripts. I normally write my own bash scripts
    with <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code> and now also <code>python</code> for such
    tasks. If you find anything, let us know.
