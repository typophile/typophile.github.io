  and credits for <em>Boomtown</em> (a 2002-03 tv series) use the oblique of some
  squarish sans. It's familiar but I can't quite identify it. (In the image above,
  the typeface is the white letters; the letters that look like graffiti on the side
  of the Los Angeles River are, well, hand-lettered graffiti on the side of the Los
  Angeles River.)"

    artificially sloped roman. That would explain why some of the stroke weights look
    so strange, especially in the small sizes used in the credits."
