body: Since I am a known hater of the plague called micro tiny pixelfonts, using them
  is no option  <BR> <BR>So normal font aye, but often you see they tend to get blurry.
  <BR> <BR>Apart from aligning the textsymbol to whole positions &#40;so x=0 y=0&#41;
  are there other tips to get font as crisp as possible? <BR> <BR>For example, I noticed
  that the text frame is hardly ever a whole number of height. If you have a 16 points
  font, you always get a frame around it with a height of for example 18.3 or so.
  Altering the frame height also resizes the font, so that isn&#39;t right.  <BR>
  <BR>Any tips???

  body: 'Having the the text box on x:0 y:0 is really only the rule for those pixel
    fonts that you dislike so much. In my experience, the most crisp anti-aliasing
    is just as likely to be found at .25 or .5 in either/both the x and y coordinates.
    It depends on the font. Then you often have to adjust the tracking and &#40;if
    the text is multiple lines&#41; leading to get the characters to continue to stay
    crisp. <BR> <BR>A quick example: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6956.gif"
    alt="flash anti-aliasing of DINMittelschrift @ 10pt"> <BR>as you can see the first
    example is starts pretty fuzzy but some of the middle lines become fairly crisp.
    So I bumped the y to a .5 for the next example which made the first line crisp
    but the middle lines get out of whack. So I tried a few different settings for
    the leading &#40;line-spacing&#41; and 2.1 seemed to keep it crisp throughout.
    This is  a common process for me when using anti-aliased text in flash. As you
    can see it can make quite a difference. Hope that helps. <BR> <BR>Mitchell'

    Doesn&#39;t make a whole  <BR>lot of sense to me but... <BR> <BR>Any web safe
    fonts &#40;with decent hinting&#41; should  <BR>display fine.

  body: Mitchel, does the technique you describe also work with bigger fonts like
    Trade Gothic 15 pts for example? <BR> <BR>Oh, and i heard that with many fonts
    they work better in odd sizes and other in even sizes &#40;12, 14 etc&#41;.

  body: Yes, I would say that with any size font in flash you  could find it&#39;s
    optimal anti-aliasing using the steps I described above. Doing so is just usually
    not as crucial with the larger point sizes. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t heard anything
    about the odd &amp; even point sizes for different fonts, but I could imagine
    finding that true with certain faces. <BR> <BR>One thing that reminds me of, is
    I have found that trying a range of non-integer point sizes &#40;x.7 for example&#41;
    will sometimes provide the best anti-aliasing. <BR> <BR>All these things are often
    worth experimenting with if you want to get past flash&#39;s rather poor anti-aliasing.

    the settings as you did in the boxes above?  Is this a function of Flash itself,
    where you started with 10 point type and then adjusted something when you assembled
    the flash movie file?'

    zealot Hrant. ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad you all are finding this useful. I&#39;ve
    always thought that it would be a good idea to store the settings I use for different
    fonts once I&#39;ve found the optimal combination of x and y, leading, and tracking
    for each point size. That way I wouldn&#39;t have to repeat the tedious process
    every time, but not suprising to me I&#39;ve never recorded it for any font. <BR>
    <BR>However, if everytime someone found some optimal settings for a font they
    posted them somewhere on typophile

    run into this same problem using dynamic text in Flash  <BR>with a bitmap typeface.
    The problem is I can&#39;t set the  <BR>letterspacing/tracking for dynamic text
    fields. At least the  <BR>option isn&#39;t available in the properties palette.
    <BR> <BR>Are you familiar with dynamic text in Flash? Do you know if  <BR>there&#39;s
    a way to correct this bug?
