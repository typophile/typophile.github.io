  body: ' Hey Sigurarm, thanks for the info! <BR> <BR>The uppercase Icelandic Eth
    looks pretty close to a D, so that&#39;s OK, but I would like to find a few names
    with the lowercase eth as one of the other letters. I love the lowercase eth.
    It&#39;s like a partial differential having a bad hair day. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    want to worry about including all the diacritics just yet. Maybe one instance
    of each kind of mark &#40;tilde, ring, accents, hungarumlaut, and whatnot&#41;
    later on. Right now I just want a good exemplar for all the Latin &#34;main&#34;
    letters. Eszet is technically a ligature, so I might drop it from consideration
    for now. '

    are NO words that begin with Eth in icelandic, as Sigurdur alluded to. <BR> <BR>&#40;No,
