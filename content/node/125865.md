  body: "Given that your sample is painted on glass, it's unlikely that it is a typeface.
    Sign painters learned, or developed their own versions of, block lettering and
    other styles.\r\n\r\nAgency Black Extended is similar, and it wouldn't take much
    work to flatten the spine of the S and close the gap in the R:\r\nhttps://store.typenetwork.com/fonts/?name=Agency\r\n\r\n"
