  got any ideas? From what I can tell this is just one typeface but let me know if
  not! Ideally I need to know both.\r\nThanks for any help."

    you'll need to customized it to recreate 'edexcel' lettering (squooshing, reducing
    /d ascender and reworking /c terminals to fit /e outline shape)

    body: Great, thanks! Looks like a nice typeface. Fortunately I don't need to recreate
      the entire logo, just add an additional phrase, so that should be simple enough.
