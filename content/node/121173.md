  body: Based on the differences in little detail, the difference in how heavy the
    letters are, and the general finish, I'm guessing it's done by hand (like the
    banner obviously is), possibly inspired by something like [[http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=83|Brothers]].

  body: "The E reminds of Alcazar, which was featured in one of Dan X. Solo\u2019s
    Dover typeface compendia. Ditch the ornament on the L, and it's not a bad template
    for all the letters in the sample.\r\n\r\nhttp://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-a.htm\r\n\r\nAnyone
    know of a legitimate source (other than the CD that came with the book)?"
