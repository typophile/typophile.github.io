  part of a graphics identity \"package\" for a small, liberal arts University in
  the mountains of North Carolina? \r\n\r\nThe school has a good academic reputation
  and is known for its small class size, rigorous academics, research, holistic approach
  to learning, community involvement and devoted faculty. Its history only dates back
  to the early 1920s, so it is not a school with a strong historical slant as many
  other schools in the East are. In other words, not an ivy-covered campus with gorgeous
  old buildings!...but a campus with mountain views :)\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting in
  the school's identity is its location in the city of Asheville, known for its outdoor
  recreation and arts/crafts/music scenes. \r\n\r\nNeeds to have a typeface identity
  that will hold up for 5 years, more or less. \r\n\r\nIn short, the type families
  need to say good/serious academics yet also be able to say friendly, eclectic, and
  fresh, too.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your ideas!\r\nashlea"

    will kick back to Typohiles for any recommendation from the membership?\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "The one thing I myself would point out here is that your 5 year period (if
    it's really real) is pretty short, so you could get away with using more \"expressive\"
    fonts than if you were shooting for a really long-term solution.\r\n\r\nBTW, Gerald
    is kidding (even if might not realize it). On the other hand, if you end up finding
    Typophile to be a useful thing, you might: give it credit, somewhere; and/or become
    a paid member.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Ashlea, its not a bad idea to find an Indie font designer and have something
    designed for your institution. Their are a lot of independent designers contributing
    at this site. You might get to the library and take out Indie Fonts 1 & 2 and
    contact some of the designers.
