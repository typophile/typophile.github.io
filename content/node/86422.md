body: "hey guys\r\ni have finished the lowercase letters and i tried generating the
  font. \r\nbut i am getting many problems\r\nfirst it says there are some open glyphs(
  i have not merged all the contours hoping I'll do some tweaking later). and asks
  me if i want to export only the closed contour glyps or not.\r\nThen my e is giving
  me a lot of trouble. when i HQ preview it (using the Tilda) i get nice anti-aliased
  font but when i am writing something (on word) the \"eye\" is misssing instead i
  am getting a black spot.(pics attached)\r\nalso my font is not anti aliased when
  i am generating it.\r\nAt smaller (36 point) my font is breaking (attached a pic
  look at 'f') but it looks fine at 48 and at 24. why is this happening?\r\nIts a
  ttf font btw\r\nCheers\r\nM"

  body: as far as the antialiasisation is concerned i guess i should hint the font
    and then come back if it's still zagged.

    to see which glyphs are missing. That will tell you which glyphs you need to examine
    for open contours. Make sure you have font audit turned on (view-show layers->font
    audit) and it should indicate any unclosed paths.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
