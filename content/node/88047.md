    Maybe this makes it easier to identify.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FontFace2_5789.png]

  body: Funny thing is they're surely using Futura on this [[http://www3.snapfish.nl/snapfishnl/flashprobe/theme=graceful/size=10x4/product=deskcalendar/calendar.startMonth=1/calendar.startYear=2012/gauth=a_xfcc_xfco_xfcd_xfce_xfcREVTK01FJ0FUSTUtXjchVzw9NlBbSTghTFE6JkAnViNAQUYyUUAnWl0pLUFFL0I3Q0hRPEdaIStZU1BUTUxIQ0YKTToiYEoxKjdUN0FYQ0lgMUswOkA6OFdRLzZMWyVQViZYM1NXVzpFUTk2U1QvPlBdVSNBLkcvXD1EYCtcPgo2XSlYSTkjUSFKSzBaVCIrJkU_XUBDRzwlLVdcJy4wYGAKYAplbmQK/gacctoid=2822736029/COBRAND_NAME=snapfishnl/|page]]
    ("...Kijk hier..." with a regular /j). So I guess it's a custom job based on Futura
    (just can't believe they actually use Ikea Sans even it looks very close).
