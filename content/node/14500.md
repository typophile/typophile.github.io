  Thanks!\r\n\r\n---Original--------\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nLooking or feedback on which of
  these (ROUGH) layouts to develop. Letterhead and envelope are essentially done --
  will post later. The card will have a tagline and graphic on the reverse side. Essentially
  working with the type blocks at this point. Haven't really locked things into a
  grid yet. Just playing with compositions. Will get into the fine details of type
  once decided.\r\n\r\nAlternative concepts are welcome.\r\n\r\n -t \r\n--------"

  body: Tim go with 2B but tighten up the leading on the three lines at the bottom
    that will give more air to the persons name/title. I remember when you were developing
    this logo, good job.

  body: "Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nThank you for the feedback. Your input confirms my eye's
    preference as well: 2B. I'll go ahead a work with the subtleties now. This is
    good news, as it may allow me to carry over a graphical concept that exists in
    the letterhead. Currently, the fine print and the line grid on the other pieces
    is at/based on 10.5pt. This is a bit big for the card so I'm going to change them
    to match the card's final type/grid -- probably 9 or 10pt.\r\n\r\nDan:\r\nThe
    logo which resulted from that old thread still lives at the website: http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/.\r\n\r\nI
    comissioned our very own Aquatoad (Randy Jones) to implement a double stacked
    \"M\" and fine tune Leviathan to make it look more authentic. He's done a bang
    up job!\r\n\r\nTimd:\r\nI know! The email adress (long TLD) provided the biggest
    challenge with this layout.\r\n\r\nBen:\r\nYes, I really like how 2B leads the
    eye, and the simple, large negative spaces make for a more cohesive composition.\r\n\r\nWill
    post some variations soon.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n -t"

    The color on the business cards looks like a very brown color, not the vibrant
    orange on the website. When I think of Maui, I definately don't think brown. Maybe
    it's just the screen, but I would try to get it the orange from the website to
    match the Hawaiian islands' vibrancy."

    name from 10.5pt to 11pt. Everyting else is 9pt, except phone fax labels at 7pt.

    last eyes on this before it goes to client. Will post letterhead and envelope
    once I have my swatch books. I still haven't chosen final color/s. Plan is it
    for to be two-color, or one- if possible.\r\n\r\nThe concept for the back of the
    card is that of a tire tread. I'd like to deboss the tread pattern and have it
    be slightly darker than the ground to give the impression of (err...) an imprint.
    Any thoughts on how to best execute this would be MUCH appreciated, i.e., color,
    how deep, etc.?\r\n\r\nWhat about the cruiserguy pattern? I tried varous sizes
    and stroke widths. To my eye, 5-high was too busy/small.\r\n\r\nWhat are your
    thoughts on the upper vs lowercase title on the card's front? I just can't decide
    on this; I like them both. Are the margins sufficient for a safe trim?\r\n\r\nInput

    ever owned or used. Take one of their bikes with a little water on the tread and
    roll it over some paper and scan that. The tracks look like a Jeep. \r\n\r\nYou
    also have a very expensive business card in that its full bleed on both sides.
    Is it necessary? The letterhead also is a bleed 3 sides. I suggest using that
    letterhead for promotions only and make most of the letterhead without the mountain
    graphic for general corespondence. Remember part of your job as a designer is
    watching out for your clients budgets. Once I had my personal letterhead with
    a bleed on three sides, but the reason it didn't cost much was I used Standard
    letterhead paper (8 1/2\" x 11\") and had it trimmed to Monarch size (7 1/4\"
    x 10 1/2\").\r\n\r\nIts a bit late, but isn't the concept of this type of adventure,
    to do it as a group experience? If it is why show one bike rider, shouldn't it
    be a group of riders?\r\n\r\nOverall its nice work.  "

    Can you center the logo over the vanishing point? I see the you'll also need to

    biker were interacting with the other information a little more. It seems to be
    distracting. If it interacted it would become a true secondary element. \r\n\r\nCard:
    I'm boring, Tim. I would prefer the card to be horizontal on both sides. It is
    a pet peeve of mine. Just me. Nothing personal. However, Do you need the biker
    and the tracks on the back? This doesn't happen anywhere else. Biker change to
    percentage of tracks and remove tracks. I like the tracks on the front. I think
    you've worked the type to near perfection for what you have to work with. I'd
    only suggest, perhaps, letterspacing a hair the title. \r\n\r\nOverall: I really

  body: "Hi Typos,\r\n\r\nThaks for all the great suggestions!\r\n\r\nHrant:\r\n\r\nI
    like your idea of mashing up the biker guy to make him look more \"frantic.\"
    I suppose when your leaning into a turn on a bike, you are anything but symmetrical.\r\n\r\nDan:\r\n\r\nBrilliant
    idea about the tread pattern. I may actually have a photo of the tread around
    here somewhere. The crusier bikes have a strange tread pattern. I had actually
    built this pattern out of the form of the \"A\" in the logotype -- which is also
    used as 'arrows' elsewhere in the set. I didn't want it to be too literal, but
    it might sell better if it was the actually tread. Not sure I have time for this
    unless I can find that photo.\r\n\r\nAs regards to costs and bleeds. The printing
    is going to fall well under budget due to the fact that I procured parent size
    sheets (Speckletone - Madero Beach) directly from French and because it's a 2-Color
    job.\r\n\r\nAs far as \"group experience\" goes -- one could go either way on
    that. Some go as groups others as couples, and solo. The tour does ride as a group,
    but many people refer to it as an individual experience with the incredible environment.\r\n\r\nTiffany:\r\n\r\nMoving
    biker left may work nicely. I'll play.\r\n\r\nYou said \"vanishing point,\" am
    I to assume that you processed a road into the horizon as a opposed to a mountain?\r\n\r\nNot
    sure how to get biker guy to interact more on the envelope. Not a lot of options
    here as far as I can tell. Ideas?\r\n\r\nCard: I had the biker only on the back,
    but it just seemed a bit boring. The tracks kind of tied it all together in a
    subdued sort of way. I like the size of the biker -- any bigger and it's not recognizable
    -- smaller and it's not prominent enough.\r\n\r\nAs per <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/\">Mark
    S's</a> (and your) suggestion -- all the 9pt text could probably use a bit of
    tracking.\r\n \r\nColor: yes the Moab like colors work well. In fact Maui's \"red
    dirt\" is a very similar color due to it's high iron content. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/inc/img/mars_lrg.jpg\">A
    Photo of Haleakala Crater</a> -- only slightly digitally exagerated.\r\n\r\nMahalo
    to everyone for your expert input. I'll have one last go around, but may not be
    able to post again until after approval.\r\n\r\nAloha,\r\n\r\n -t"
