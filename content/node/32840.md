  piece</A>...\r\n\r\n\"Today, Helvetica is the most widely distributed typeface in
  the world, if you discount Arial,\" says Otmar Hoefer of German company Linotype,
  which now owns the design.\r\n\r\nWonder if he intended to say \"if you include
  Arial\" - as surely Times, Verdana or even Comic Sans are more widely distributed?

  body: Maybe he meant "Today, Helvetica is the most widely distributed typeface in
    the world, EVEN if you discount Arial," instead of "Today, Helvetica is the most
    widely distributed typeface in the world, if you discount Arial,"?

  body: How about "Helvetica is the most widely distributed typeface in the world
    if you don't count any font bundled with Linux, Windows, Office or the iPod, and
    only look at fonts shipped with Mac OS that begin with H." ;-)

  body: Note that he said distributed, not sold, shipped, purchased, or even used.
    Depending on how the suits at Linotype define distribution, he could very well
    be speaking truthfully.

    Re truthiness - I think he was misquoted, not being untruthful.   \r\n"
