  font that has attributes of a chinese style or calligraphic style but not too traditional.
  Maybe something that is quite square but most importantly it has to be readable
  and modern looking. I've had a look through dafonts.com and linotype but nothing
  jumped out at me.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? \r\n\r\nAny help would
  be grateful received\r\n\r\nBeani\r\n\r\n:)"

    not the wild west.

    come back with a better communication, so even I can understand what she is looking
    for."
