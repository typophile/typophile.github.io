  & Type Design\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_-\_\_Hebrew Typography & Type Design\r\n\r\nI suggest
  to create a similar group:\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_-\_\_<b>Cyrillic Typography & Type Design</b>\r\n\r\n<img

  Typography & Type Design\">\r\n\r\nBecause the Cyrillic type design is an area that
  is interesting enough for everybody here with its rich history and its boom in nowadays.
  And the Russian type designers need a suitable place to join their efforts.\r\n\r\nAlso
  a non-Cyrillic authors can post here their requests to add a Cyrillic glyphs to
  their typefaces.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"
