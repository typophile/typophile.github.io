  spawned the lawsuit...I thought there''d be some opinions. So what do you all think?
  Is his lawsuit with or without merit? '

  body: I believe all the paperwork pertaining to the law-suit was set on an IBM Selectric
    typewriter in Prestige Elite which was recovered from a skip outside the CBS offices
    in 1972.

  body: "I don't think that Rather contests the fraudulence of the document in question.
    The issue is instead that he claims he was wrongly portrayed as deeply involved
    in the story, when he was largely just the narrator. And then he was made the
    fall guy. And the story itself, if not the document, was true: Bush was AWOL and
    a draft dodger. \r\n\r\nIt's probably foolish of Rather to sue, but I wouldn't
    be surprised if his claims turn out to be largely true.  "

  body: i believe his claims ARE largely true. he was made the fall guy, was marginalized,
    and had his reputation ruined. and his claim that CBS cowed to white house pressure...
    is that hard to believe?

    though."

    . . .\r\n\r\nThe question remains was he fired or did he resign? If it is the
    latter, I wouldn't think he has much wiggle room to negotiate a settlement but
    if it was the former, chances are he would've had some clauses in in contract
    that requires some sort of financial buyout. . .\r\n\r\nPersonally I have no opinion
    on the reasons for dismissal, I'm only throwing in an opinion from the perspective
    of his contractual employment and make no mistake even network evening news anchors
    have contracts much closer to actors and singers than employees . . .\r\n\r\nStuart

    him, but the network new division took a huge credibility hit as well\u2014after
    all, most people realized that Dan was just a talking head and that plenty of
    other people were involved. Combine this with some of his crappier programs on
    Discovery\u2014especially the no-class \u201CPlastic Planes\u201D scare piece\u2014and
    it seems like Dan is having some pretty big senior moments."

    of experience.\r\nmy take is he shouldered some of the blame for the story (although
    he shouldn't have) and, ulimately left CBS to be a 'team player.' but when CBS
    CONTINUED to publicly shove the blame at him, ruining the rep he'd built over
    all those years, he finally decided 'enough is enough.' "

    he won''t concede that the document is fraudulent. He may be right that the contents
    are the views of the person who supposedly wrote it--this was confirmed by his
    secretary. But as Thomas showed, it is not from a typewriter, and so has been
    faked. '

    Katie Couric (with those internally at CBS also discrediting her) I would think
    it shouldn't be too hard to make that case."
