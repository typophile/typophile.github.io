body: Hi all, first time here. Very impress with all the critiques here. You guys
  provided great constructive criticisms. It prompted me to post a current project
  that I'm in a bit of a stand still. I'm currently updating a company logo, the old
  one seem very out dated. The company provides medical & dental insurance so we can't
  really go wild on this one. It needs to be a bit conservative. Anyway, here are
  the various logos I came up with, I would be very appreciated if I can get any feedback
  to further improve the logo. Thanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_4134.gif]

    your shapes and colors. Work in black and white first, then move on to color.

  body: "SOme things are worth keeping like the star and probably also orange colour
    because it goes well with the feeling of the word best. Maybe a 0,20,100,0 (CMYK)
    would be even more \"golden\"... Otherwise they are becoming too complicated in
    comparison to the original one.\r\n\r\nFirst step I'd do is I'd try to find a
    sans serif font to replace in the original logo that would go best with the star
    in hexagon.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "I don't know...  the elongated hexagon IS distinctive...  I do agree with
    the \"too many elements\" comments. The tagline as is is SOOO unnecessary...  reminds
    me of 'best little whorehouse in Texas.'  Comparisons are odious.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking
    I'd like to see a nice typographic treatment of the word 'Best' inside the the
    hexagon (the one you've done for 'BL' is quite handsome) and then finish off with
    'Life' in grey outside the hexagon (either to the right or below).\r\n\r\nThe
    tagline SHOULD say something...  other than what you've already said:\r\n\r\n'BEST
    life and health insurance for the 21st century'\r\n\r\n(not sure it needs 'life
    and health')"

  body: "Good Monday everyone! appreciate all the great feedback.\r\n\r\nLook like
    everyone agreed it's way too busy, I will work on simplifying it.\r\n\r\nPenn,
    I agreed with you on \"BEST\" doesn't need to be in all caps, but unfortunately
    that is how it's being use in all the collateral. Maybe I should try putting \"Life\"
    in all caps also...just like the old logo to balance it out a bit.\r\n\r\nChazglen,
    funny you mention putting the word \"BEST\" inside the hexagon cause that is how
    the original BEST life logo was created in the 70s. I did tried to update that
    also.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldBest_4353.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
    again everyone...I will take all your feedback & rework the design a bit."

  body: "#1 definitely has less clutter. Tag looks somehow horizontally distorted
    - stretched. Maybe the logo would look better if you used larger type for your
    mandatory tag line. I's still consult the client whether it's possible to change
    it to Life and Health Insurance, because logo already reads \"Best life\" and
    company really is one thing too many.\r\n\r\nAnyway. I'd try larger tag type that
    will probably span more than 1 line. I think your logo will look much better this
    way and you will also eliminate small size problems.\r\n\r\nSince logos should
    normally evolve I'd suggest you stay with #1 and refine it.\r\n\r\nYou'll also
    have to do something about the star cut because you created a very thin line that
    may look as an error and it will probably create more bad than good.\r\n\r\nCarry
    on.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    for me and in general seems like a very generic \"we're a bright fun happy good
    company\" logo. Number 1 generates more interest for me.\r\n\r\nI think the problem
    of tightness in the logotype is only exacerbated by the spine of the \"B\" being
    cropped by the box. (Things don't seem too tight in number 2.) Try spreading the
    box away (give the logotype some breathing room) and see if that helps ease the
    tightness. \r\n\r\npenn"
