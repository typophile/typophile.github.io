body: Hi all. I was wondering if anyone can help me. I&#39;ve started to buy a lot
  of fonts and my collection is getting a bit much. Can you someone suggest a good
  font managment tool/software?  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

    horrors, I didn&#39;t have any form of font management up until a couple of months
    ago. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m an idiot in terms of technology and find it easy to play
    with, ahem, I mean, use.
