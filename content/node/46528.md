body: "As an experiment, I have been trying to contstruct a useable fat slab serif
  typeface using Fontstruct. Some of the characters look quite nice, I think, but
  others look ... well, not so nice. What needs changing? And how should I solve the
  F, so that it looks normal when it preceeds lower case characters?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the problem about your F relates to the E. They stick out, I think
    primarily because they don't have the same vacuum feeling of the rest of the typeface.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    I kind of like it. It's really not my style, but I can see some contexts it could
    be suitable.\r\n\r\nBy the way, does Slabbedask mean anything normal in Norwegian?"

  body: "I will have a look at the E and F. Thanks!\r\n\r\n<i>Slabbedask</i> is a
    norwegian word used to describe a sloppy, careless person. It is related to the
    english word <i>slapdash</i>."
