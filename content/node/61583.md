  of this year. For the most part I'm happy, with one glaring exception --- I am stunned
  at how difficult it is to get good, consistent typographic output on a laserprinter.
  \r\n\r\nIn days of yore, every app would offload page rendering to the printer driver,
  and thus fonts were rendered the same way in every program. Now, every app seems
  to use a hodgepodge of system services, proprietary logic, and printer magic to
  get the job done, and 10 pt Sabon will look slightly different depending on the
  path it takes to the printer. \r\n\r\nIs there a preferred method for getting the
  highest-quality laserprinted output? Believe me, I've asked on the relevant technical
  support forums, but talking about rendering problems of 10pt serifs is like convincing
  people that your imaginary friend is really coming to dinner.\r\n\r\n"

    which provides the best output.
