body: I like the Typophile iCal calendar, but I noticed it&#39;s missing some important
  birthdays. How do we add information? I&#39;m new to the whole iCal concept, having
  previously kept all my appointments written in sharpie on my hand and/or other appendages.

  body: As I recall, the b-days on the iCal were added because of a thread called
    something like &#39;When&#39;s your birthday?&#39; &#40;makes sense, doesn&#39;t
    it?&#41; Someone then took the time to syncronize the iCal .

  body: I have the Typophile iCal calendar loaded on my Mac, and find immensely informative.
    Of course, my birthday has been included &#40;as per the aforementioned thread&#41;,
    so perhaps I&#39;m biased. This tool definitely needs to be pimped more regularly.
    Pity the poor souls relegated to that &#39;Windoze&#39; platform...
