body: "This cover of the 32nd annual Best of News Design book was designed by Adonis
  Durado, design director of the Times of Oman & Al Shabiba in Muscat, Oman.\r\n\r\nAs
  he explains in [[http://www.snd.org/2011/09/meet-the-man-behind-the-cover/|this
  article]], Durado used Whitman (designed by Kent Lew) as the main text, and chose
  Ingeborg Block (by Michael Hochleitner) for the nameplate.\r\n\r\nNo photos, just
  typography on this cover. I think it looks great. Anyone care to discuss the design
  and typography of this cover?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SND32-cover_4426.png]"

    face, all caps.\r\n\r\nOne statistic missing is the amount of time the judges
    spent looking at each entry \u2014 around 0.35 seconds, I would surmise.\r\n\r\n"
