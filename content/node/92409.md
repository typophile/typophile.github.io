  .\r\nIt looks like a regular sans-serif font, but which one ?!\r\nThe website is
  in Flash + I can not manage to zoom in, so I did not manage to identify it properly.\r\nIf
  you want, the \"Projects\" page has lots of upper-case and regular letters ;)\r\n\r\nthanks
  a lot for your help\r\nThomas."
