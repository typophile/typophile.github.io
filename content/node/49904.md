  client tells me its name is \"Optimicrogramma 5 medium\", however I couldn't find
  this font anywhere. Even worse, not even Google seems to know this font.\r\n\r\nCan
  anybody help me out here?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help..."

    added. Same designer, Aldo Novarese.\r\n\r\nThe \"Opti\" prefix usually indicates
    a face distributed by Castcraft Software."
