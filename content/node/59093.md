    your email address and send your email account as much spam as they possibly can.
    I usually do something called obfuscation where I spell out the email address
    but in such a way that one has to manually put it together to send me an email
    - something like so: notmyemail [at] domain.com. It at least makes someone (or
    their script) have to do some work before getting a valid email address. As your
    post is right now, your email is available for Google to search and cache. Fortunately
    you are using an email provider with fairly excellent spam filters!'

  body: "<em>What is a naked email address? Is this a problem? How do I fix this?</em>\r\n\r\nChristopher,
    I believe I tried to warn you about this in an older post of yours. By naked e-mail
    address, Ben means that you are using the e-mail address, as is, on a website
    (this one), where it can be picked up by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spambot\">spambot</a>.
    A way of avoiding this is by typing it indirectly. For example, like this:\r\n\r\ntypographer
    [at] gmail [dot] com\r\n\r\nor like this:\r\n\r\ntypographer-at-gmail-dot-com\r\n\r\nThe
    idea behind this is that thinking humans will get it, but unthinking spambots
    won't. :-)\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Ack, I belatedly see that Ben already answered your question.
    Oh well..."

    but jumped ship over to HMS typography, and the rest, as they say is history.

  body: Regarding my use of names, using last names is a convention in academia (science).
    Consistently using people's last names between disciplines (typography and psychology)
    assists me with my memory. As I have a neurological and seizure disorder, memory
    formation is a significant problem with me as a side effect of my seizures and
    the associated medications. I will most likely continue using this convention.
    No disrespect is intended.

    because I did my last year of the degree a couple years later at another school
