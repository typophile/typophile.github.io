body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nJust joined this site because I heard that you typophilesare
  really good at what appears to be a bit of a challenge to me. I will get my bike
  done with a new pain job. I am also getting some custom decals done. I want to keep
  the original font, size, design etc. but am going for a custom color. The printer
  I'm using to get the decals done, found some similar fonts but couldn't identify
  the actual font used. So here's my cry for help from you guys.\r\n\r\nHere's an
  image of the decal, hope you guys can identify the font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZZRFairings_6410.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help."

  body: Sorry, don't know this one and really doubt there'd be one as almost all motorcycle
    woodmarks are actually custom letterings. As I guess you're clearly not after
    anything else than a perfect match, I can only suggest youou to retrace it yourself
    to be as close as possible from the original.
