body: Hey all again its time for my newb question of the week. <BR> <BR>I am doing
  layout and it requires a 12 point type with &#40;I would think&#41; 14 leading.  Everything
  looks fine until I turn on &#34;align to base-line grid&#34; then every line is
  dramatically spaced.  But when I turn off i off &#40;aling to base-line grid&#41;
  it looks fine but of course the coloumns dont match up.  If I turn leading to 12
  then it makes the spacing a little to close between the lines. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
  any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

  body: You have to go to the InDesign &#40;Mac&#41; or Edit &#40;PC&#41; menu, then
    choose Preferences-&#62;Grids. There you can set the baseline grid setting &#40;used
    for the whole document&#41;. <BR> <BR>You can define a starting point and an interval
    &#40;&#34;Increment Every&#34;&#41;. InDesign &#34;stretches&#34; the value of
    your leading to the next factor of the interval. Say, if you set an interval of
    13 points, 12 point leading will get you 13 points &#40;13 x 1&#41;, but 14 points
    will become 26 &#40;13 x 2&#41;. You should adjust the increment to your copy
    and use it for headlines or captions only if it makes sense &#40;e. g. the caption
    is in the same size but italic&#41;. <BR> <BR>Try a bit with the options available,
    it&#39;s worth it!  :-&#41;
