body: "No clue if this is absolute rubbish or not. I found an old Caslon specimen
  and thought about doing a monospace version of it. It seems like most monospace
  fonts out there are very boring, so I wanted to do one that has a much more pleasant
  feel. Did some sketches and I've digitized a few letters so far. I think Kris Sowersby's
  Pitch has inspired me, you can see some of it in the bracketing.\r\nThoughts?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hello_6602.png]\r\n\r\nI
  wanted it to be very legible on-screen so it has a really tall x-height.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helloz_4776.png]\r\n\r\nSome
  characters are pretty tricky. Anyone think this has potential or just isn't worth
  it?"

    forms (excepting Nitti and Pitch) while appreciating their functionality. Hopefully
    I can get both with this. Thanks!

  body: "You might try using the serifs to your advantage to make fill in the space
    and make a more even color. Perhaps more than you are now depending on the letter.
    \ While you do on the |f| and |t|, I think it's lacking in the |r|. On some letters
    you may want to drop serifs entirely in parts. The |m| and |w| could really do
    without the serifs, I would venture to say. They are already crowded without them.\r\n\r\nThe
    |z| seems a little off to me with the angle of the serifs. But the feature is
    nice, if you use similar angle for some of the other serifs, that may be cool.\r\n\r\nLooks
    interesting, love to see where you go with it."

  body: Some of the Caslon flavor is gone, due to trying to make it work for a monospaced
    slab. I'm considering adding a bit more contrast and some slight adjustment of
    the serifs to get some of that feel back. The line between bizarre and balancing
    both influences is a thin one! I'll post some more screen shots when I get through
    the next round of adjustments.
