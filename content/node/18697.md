  body: "The TrueType format has been integrated into OpenType. Each Windows TrueType
    (.ttf) font is already an OpenType font, more specifically, an OpenType TT font
    (OpenType font with TrueType outlines). All such fonts work in both Windows and
    Mac OS X. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: If the font is a Windows flavor TrueType font you can simply install it on
    Mac OS X (license permitting). If its a Mac flavor TrueType font then things may
    eb abit more tricky.

  body: "I hate to bump an old thread, but there's things in here relevant to what
    I'm looking for at the moment.\r\n\r\nIsn't there a command line tool that's scriptable
    to allow me to convert multiple truetype fonts into the opentype format? I'd rather
    use something I can get down and dirty with rather than a fancy GUI program to
    do an incredibly simple job (well, it's not incredibly simple by hand, but you
    should get my point).\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nOh boy, I just found what I was
    looking for, right here on [[http://typophile.com/node/67406|this very forum]].
    \ Apparently there's a nice little set of tools called [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/files/|TTX/FontTools]]."

    OT.

  body: Well, it can convert a ttf to a ttx file, and a ttx file to a ttf file. Sure,
    it's not the most streamlined method, but it'd be lifesaver for a few one-off
    conversion jobs.

  body: TTX can be a help, when you want to avoid damages during a conversion from
    TrueType to OT. First convert it to PS OTF (with FontLab for example), then decompile
    the tables of the TTF and the generated OTF. In the decompiled TTF you have to
    make a few changes, namely in the name records, because there is a slight difference
    in the specification. And you have to remove a few tables, that are not in OTF,
    and you have to add the CFF-table. Then you can recompile it.
