  body: Good eye Yves! That sample is one of the old &#40;i.e. small&#41; ones in
    the Guide. E &#43; F sells it as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/ef-bold/testdrive.html?s=A.H.S.&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Ballantines Script</a>, and it has also been sold under the names  Diana
    and Goddess, according to Dan Solo&#39;s collection, and Dianna, according to
    the old Phil&#39;s Photo book. I don&#39;t doubt that there were other names,because
    this script shows up at various freeware sites with different names yet.
