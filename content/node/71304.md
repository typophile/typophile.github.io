body: "I really like Phaeton!\r\n\r\nIt looks a bit steam punkish -- evoking associations
  with Victorian metalworks, pre-Jugendstil; kind of a prelude to Arnold Boecklin.
  It would look <em>great</em> on screen in a steam punk game such as \"The Chaos
  Engine\"!\r\n\r\n(It's a pity the entire Steam Punk genre had only a fleeting moment
  of success. William Gibson/Bruce Sterling's co-op \"The Difference Engine\" is still
  a good read.)"

    \u201COh I like how Phaeton makes my favorite web site feel like an old medicine
    cabinet with emaille drawer knobs\u2026 slightly twisted.\u201D I second that."

    among an underground fandom. For example, the Girl Genius webcomic.
