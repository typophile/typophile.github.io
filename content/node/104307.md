    body: 'thank you don-this is really helpful!  I''m not familiar with the typographic
      practice and have a further question: the typeface used in the advert is shorter
      and heavier, is that something the user would alter or is it because bindlestiff
      nf  is  actually a different typeface?'

  body: "We know that logo designer's distort fonts for effect. Otherwise how can
    they claim to have done any work worth paying for. The closest I can find to the
    logo, with its boxy S and R  is Binder-Style and as far as I can see from checking
    Nick's digital version against an old specimen it is indeed a true revival.\r\nAnyway,
    I didn't claim that it is a 100% match, I merely said to \"try\" the font. Sans
    fonts are ultra easy to churn out and there could well be a descendant of the
    Binder design that is a 100% match, either as an in-house font by Cover Girl or
    as a font generally available.\r\nDon"

  body: i was very happy about what you found! i didn't think you were claiming an
    identical match i just wondered if the cover girl text (as the slightly shorter
    and fatter version of binder) was an established typeface with ease of access
    or if it was something that was altered in-house ie. the user would, therefore,
    have to alter it themselves...
