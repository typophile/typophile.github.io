  i am wondering on acceptable layouts for this kind of book. My thesis is on the
  dark arts of title sequences and i want something to kind of reflect this but i'm
  not sure what kind of scope students have with the thesis.\r\nAny tips out there?\r\nThanks\r\nNeph"

  body: "The overwhelming vast majority of educational institutions have strict rules
    on how theses must be formatted and many have a template with their requirements
    already set up (usually in Word) that you can download. \r\n\r\nCheck with your
    supervisor first, and then search your school's website."

  body: We have a fairly bland structured 12 point type, double spacing and plenty
    of margin (for marking) but thats just for our submission copy. We can submit
    another version for store in the library. Check them out maybe? Best of luck.
    Go Saul Bass all over it!

    governed by this standard.
