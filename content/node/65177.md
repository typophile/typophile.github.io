  I'm production manager on my university's magazine, and we're interested in redesigning
  our magazine to be less The New Yorker and more Wired or another equivalently modern
  magazine. I was wondering if any of you know some really nice modern fonts we should
  investigate into purchasing for our magazine's new cover typeface. We were thinking
  either thin or bold lettering, possibly in all lowercase with some nice x-height.
  That being said, I think something like Myriad Pro won't strike readers as being
  all too ingenious. We want an awesome, not-really-overused-yet typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time, guys!\r\n\r\n-- David"

  body: In many ways, the title influences the font...is the title more than found
    characters? I always think of the magazine Mademoiselle, which is a long title
    by anyone's standards and it was a condensed Futura in its later years. My own
    feeling about magazine logos is that they should not have too much character;
    they have typically been simple because of newsstands. A recent resign I did I
    went back to News Gothic because it was strong, readable and just seemed right.
    I would also recommend House Industries Chalet (Tokyo) http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet
    as a font that has character and is not overused.

  body: David, you should get the cover designed by a graphic designer, someone with
    strong ideas of what a cover should look like, which will inform their choice
    of type/lettering. Picking a typeface that you hope will be trendy is not cover
    design.

    of development and a skilled practitioner to perform. Don't get a font first and
    then saddle a designer with it. Hire a professional--you may even have a design
    school and design faculty on your campus to help you.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
