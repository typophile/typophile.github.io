  wants a bold display face to be used on a poster. After showing him countless specimens
  he's requested something between Vag Rounded and Mod (see attached pics). It's left
  me slightly stumped to be honest, as the gulf between those two typefaces is pretty
  huge! If anyone has any suggestions I'd love to hear them.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nJono"

    place. My client wants it much bolder than that even, so Florian's suggestion
    was a good one considering the woolly description I gave. Any more suggestions
    would be welcome though.\r\n\r\nThanks"
