    and i'm kind of collecting it; if you would consider working also on astral, it
    would really be nice\r\n\r\nb"

  body: "The only relevant image that Google finds for \"mecanorma astral\" is ...
    the one above! Sadly, I lost my Mecanorma sample book ages ago. I cannot recall
    the last time I used a real rub-off font.\r\n\r\nDid you scan this yourself? If
    so, can you post a hi-res scan of a couple of characters? I'm trying to see if
    all characters have the same background image (or with just tiny variations).\r\n\r\nOn
    a related note: would the background in the punctuation be missing because it
    was too difficult to do, or for purely artistic reasons?"

  body: "yes, this is a low-res version of a pic i scanned several months ago from
    a paper catalog: the original image is pretty little, so the high res scan shows
    print imperfections and the paper texture; however, as soon as i'll be' back in
    my studio i'll check and post it; punctuation background image is missing and
    i guess this is because there is not enough room inside them, and because you're
    not supposed to go too long with that kind of weird/funny display font\r\n\r\nb\r\n"

    owners of the new company that owns all Mecanorma fonts. I can tell you that the
    requested font is currently not available as a digital font.\r\n\r\nOf the many
    fonts we have, only a small amount are available in digital format."

    in digital - but is there a simple list of the fonts somewhere? That might help
    some people quite a bit.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think there are a lot of unauthorized digital
    versions of your fonts all around the Internet... Do you plan on taking any action
    against those?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
