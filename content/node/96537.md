body: "The name should give you a clue.  A would-be modern classic in the mould of
  Helvetica or Futura, but with just a hint of Art Deco flavouring thrown in.  Crisp,
  bold, geometric, ideal for headlining an ad or a magazine article, yet versatile
  enough to be used as a text face.  What do you think?  Just released from my foundry
  \u2013 Studio K \u2013 at myfonts.com, Graffix is available in Regular, Italic,
  Bold and Bold Italic in OTF and TTF and as a web font."

  body: Hmm... More of a Kabel, IMAO. But, yeah, it feels a tad cramped on screen
    outside of display sizes. Maybe add headline and text cuts with wider spacing?
