  get some feedback on it. The attached pdf is a bit of a type specimen I was required
  to do for the project which hopefully shows most of what you  would need to see
  to critique it. I obviously have a ton to learn but I'm loving type design thus-far.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt's meant to be a vertically accented strong geometric slab serif for
  display. The No7 represents a weight system I plan on implementing, with each font
  file in the family having a corresponding number value from 0-9.\r\n\r\nI'm also
  now beginning research on how to get all the diacritical marks/alternate characters
  to actually work outside of the glyph window, so for the moment they don't work
  but hopefully will soon.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the image won't attach so I'm stuck
  with the pdf for now.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n\r\n\u2014Brian"

    like it curves inward but the overall\r\nlook is nice.  p and q look wider than
    g"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. I fixed the g width issue. I'm open to suggestions
    about the CGScs serifs, but everything I've tried thusfar has been too heavy/awkward
    looking. Perhaps when I do the lighter weights those can come in, but honestly
    the slight mix of a few sans serif characters doesn't bother me.\r\n\r\nCould
    you clarify what you mean on the R?\r\n\r\n"

    \u2013 looking at the pdf it's perfectly in line with the bowl above it\u2013
    just doesn't look like it is.but I have had some long nights recently"

  body: "First off : Keep going! Great work on the face, and nice work on the presentation
    as well.\r\n\r\nI would maybe nudge you to look at the typeface from the angle
    of evenness of color. Perhaps you could use color as a guide to start introducing
    optical adjustments to individual characters (and inform the kerning / sidebar
    situation down the line)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be afraid to deviate here and there
    from the geometric ruleset you have in place in order to firm up the <em>appearance</em>
    of mathematic perfection (never quite one and the same).\r\n\r\n( which I'm sure
    you're aware of, but I would maybe go even further )\r\n\r\nFor instance, the
    uc M,W, N all pop out to me as darker in that block of uppercase text. There are
    also cases like the alternate lc a, or the lc b, where the diminishing joint between
    bowl and stem lightens the color. It thus may be worthwhile to investigate slightly
    compensating by narrowing the bowls, etc etc.\r\n\r\nI think the way you get from
    A to \u03A9 would totally be a couple dozen cycles of printing out, tweaking and
    repeating for this project.\r\n\r\n"
