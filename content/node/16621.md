  or typographer with a nice contemporary but refined style? This is in the pharmaceutical
  industry, so it can't be too \"crazy\", and standard calligraphy is not the right
  direction.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nR\r\n"

  body: "Just wanting to clarify, since you used typographer, lettering, custom typeface
    and logo all together:\r\n\r\nLettering: Hand-written or hand-drawn lettering
    for reproduction, can be used for titles, logos. signs, etc. Unique, distinct
    word-shapes or swashes make it impossible to reconstruct using type. \r\nTypographer:
    Uses type, arranges typographic elements, lays out pages, knows typefaces.\r\nCustom
    typeface: Type Designer makes new or modified typeface for use on computers by
    custom client.\r\nLogo: Identity mark for product or company. \r\n\r\nSo, what
    is it you are looking for again? Clearly you don't want calligraphy. Do you want
    an alphabet you can use again and again? A single piece of lettering for a logo?
    One piece in your portfolio (CustomVue) uses custom lettering in a logo. Maybe
    that is what you are referring to. \r\n\r\nA lettering artist like Jill Bell or
    Michael Clark can do custom hand lettering and logos for reproduction, and both
    have also made several useful typefaces. Michael and Jill also both do calligraphy....
    Then there's Rob Leuschke. \r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
