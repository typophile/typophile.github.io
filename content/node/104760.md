  of mine for the past week. I am a bit ashamed to say that I had no real plan except
  for the fact that I love sans-serif and grotesque typefaces. Personally I love it
  so far and the project has given me an excuse to learn Fontlab as well. \r\n\r\nI
  am currently looking up kerning tutorials before I start with that, but I would
  love some critique on my glyphs. I want to make them as good as I possibly can.
  I am also appreciative for any tips, tutorial links, or recommended literature that
  I can read up on!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_4879.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA
  PDF is attached for closer inspection! \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    My only issue is the lowercase g, it seems it isn't quite as refined in thin/thick
    stroke contrast as the rest of the typeface. I would give that another go.\r\nAlso,
    the diagonal stroke in your lowercase z seems a little too thin, it makes the
    z feel too light in comparison with the rest of the typeface.\r\n\r\nI also recommend
    leaving it alone for a week, and when you return you'll notice alot of things
    on your own. Awesome job otherwise."
