body: "Had a fantastic weekend in a course organised by Grafia, the Finnish Graphic
  Designer's organisation. It was a letterpress course, where the teacher Mikko Keski-V\xE4h\xE4l\xE4
  had brought a selection of his woodblock and lead fonts for us to use as we pleased.
  There was one graphic press, and we also used spoon or bone to rub the text in (good
  method for thinner paper). It was my first time to actually use those letters, and
  a fantastic experience.\r\n\r\nSome pictures can be seen here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/milicarr/7083031803/in/photostream\r\n"
