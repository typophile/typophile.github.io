body: "I'm looking for a variation on what I presume to be Optima, an example of which
  I've attached. \r\n\r\nCompared to the LinoType Optima example if found online,
  the differences I immediately pick out are:\r\na squatter, rounder 'S', and wider,
  elongated horizontal strokes in the 'E'. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me solve this one?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    a pre-digital format.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: It's an old film font called Stettler. Can't find much info about it other
    than a short one-line specimen in an old catalog (no full alphabet showings).
