body: "A software company to which I am contracted asked me to redesign their brand
  in the blink of an eye.(a couple of days) As all my time is inundated by a pile
  of other \"urgent and more important\" work to do for this same client and I am
  not receiving any additional resources (more money nor more time) I will not be
  able to dedicate the amount of attention to this project that any branding effort
  truly deserves. However I have never in my career delivered mediocre work and lacking
  any time at all in which to conceive a brand is still no excuse. I therefore turn
  to you and to any one who wishes to supply their input. Specifically I am requesting
  any input on the word mark concept I have started. This image only demonstrates
  the lettering concept but none of the letters are finalized yet. I like the M and
  U. I also believe the A once refined will work nicely. The Z, once drawn properly,
  might also work but I want to draw suggestions on it. As for the T and the H they
  are my biggest concern as I would like their form to be a bit more harmonies with
  the other letters.\r\n\r\nPlease provide impute asap.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nThank
  you to everyone who took the time to comment on the quick concept sketch I placed.
  Unfortunately it seem that almost no one read what I wrote or that I did not express
  myself clearly as every one seems to address this as a completed design rather than
  a quick thumbnail to try to communicate a concept. The X-height and strokes are
  irrelevant and arbitrary at this point. Also arbitrarily drawn is the crossbar on
  the A, H and t although I want suggestions on unifying them. The general concept
  that I like and was trying to communicate was how the bowl curve of the u plays
  off the M and it\u2019s apex and have these counter echoed by the A. What I do not
  like is that I have not yet arrived at how to make all the letters compatible. Expressing
  that the H or z needs work dose not help me as I am very well aware of all that
  is wrong with those quickly drawn letter forms. My problem is that I do not have
  the time to dedicate to make the portion of the concept I like work within a hole.
  This is why I placed the quick sketch here to solicit specific ideas as to how to
  make all the letters work as a unified hole and still retain the element of the
  M, U and A playing off each other.\r\n\r\nPlease provide specific ideas as to how
  to make the letters work.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n"

    z especially sticks out - I feel like the crossbar needs to match the bowl curve
    of the u. \r\n\r\nThe A gets too much attention - perhaps  connect the crossbar
    all the way? It feels scaled down compared to the m, and therefore out of balance.
    \r\n\r\nMaybe you could play with some ligatures somewhere, too? (th comes to
    mind)\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm concerned the letters are so flat they won't scale down
    very well.  "

    asked you to take on a significant project while providing neither the time nor
    additional fees required.  How can you say "yes" to something like this?

  body: I agree with Alaska. It flows well, then the T and H stop it. Maybe you could
    try some detail, or perhaps altering an existing face, instead of building a new
    one from scratch in a time constraint like that.

    asked for, but then where is the place?  I brought up the point because Alfonso
    clearly doesn't have enough time to fully work out a single concept. While we
    can help him formally with letter constructions, I think it far more relevant
    and instructive to help him solve what's really a business and client/designer
    relationship problem. If he can solve that, then he'll have more time to consider
    his concepts and work it further so Typophile's readers can provide better constructive
    criticism.\r\n\r\nAnd to push myself further into dark territory (and echo others'
    sentiments), I don't feel we should be providing too much help for those that
    whip off a quick wordmark and throw it to the gallery. We're not here to do your
    work for you."

    "irrelevant", it''s practically impossible to provide you with any meaningful

    and I find a Font chosen to be pass\xE9 and cheap looking or if its custom its
    done in a style that will not last. Sorry for being blunt, but there are a large
    number of alternative Fonts available for a really professional word mark. Also,
    these day we sometimes get requests from clients that are pressing and may not
    pay enough. But with most clients we are building a relationship. This being said,
    relationship always needs both parties to give and receive, both ways. But you
    must never sell yourself short of your Professional Quality Work and craftsmanship,
    unless its for a Non-Profit Org. I've done very professional Word marks for many
    clients and if they don't understand the value, then you are journeying to the
    \"Free\" and cheap zone. Branding should never be approached in this manner, because
    its major implications and of its importance to any company.\r\n\r\nDavid Daigle,
