    I can only say they use the same typeface in Glasgow in Scotland.\r\n[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~owend/I/R/stnpages/glasgowcentralsign.jpg]]\r\nReminds
    me of Corpid, but the 'g' and 'i' are obviously different."

    you are right. your sample is not  Rail Alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe Glasgow face is very
    close to the Dublin on, but there seem to be some subtle differences to the top
    curve of the lowercas 'a' and the tail of the lowercase 'g'. The 'C' is a bit
    more open too, I think. Again - sorry about the photos\r\n\r\nI think I'll just
    write Irish Rail and ask what it is & report back. :)\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "Glad to see something of a local flavour being discussed. I\u2019ve talked
    at length with friends here (Ireland) about <a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1221/811270354_689e4b1f3b.jpg?v=0\">this
    typeface</a> as it puzzles me greatly. Apologies for the verbose posting.\r\n\r\nThe
    original C\xF3ras Iompair \xC9ireann (CIE) corporate typeface was designed by
    [[Tony Fahy]] in 1999/2000 and was called CIE2000 <em>or</em> CIE2K. You can check
    it out <a href=\"http://www.tonyfahy.com/html/type_design.html\">here</a>. To
    be honest it is quite ugly.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, (I have heard) it was cleaned-up
    by another Irish designer. Whether this new typeface is the cleaned up version,
    I don\u2019t know. They both share some similar characteristics.\r\n\r\nTo add
    to the mystery, the new typeface is used by CIE in all of their annual reports
    (available <a href=\"http://www.cie.ie/about_us/annual_reports.asp\">here</a>)
    under the name Nexus Sans. The typeface is obviously <strong>not</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_nexus_sans/\">Nexus
    Sans</a> by [[Martin Majoor]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_3898.jpg]"

    there's more than one typeface in use. The signs pictured above don't have the
    rounded corners of CIE 2000.\r\n\r\nI have actually written to CIE to ask what
    typefaces they use. I'll let you know what they say if I get a reply. \r\n\r\n@
    Kellie Str\xF8m,\r\n\r\nYou're right. the old one is better. More fitting anyways.
    The donut logo seems a bit nautical... Like a life preserver or a loop of rope."

  body: "Sorry to drag up an old post, but I thought I'd answer Conor's question about
    the Nexus Sans typeface currently used by Irish Rail (Iarn\xF3d \xC9ireann).\r\n\r\nIn
    2003 I was commissioned by a company called Creative Inc. to audit and redesign
    the CIE 2K font, originally designed by Tony Fahy. The redesigned font is called
    \u2018Nexus Sans\u2019.\r\n\r\nA absolute condition of the redesign was that I
    had to conserve the basic characteristics of the CIE2K font.\r\n\r\nFirst I carried
    out qualitative research in three areas:\r\n\r\n1.  how the CIE 2K font was being
    used,\r\n2.  whether its design was suitable for that use, and\r\n3.  an evaluation
    of its standard of technical execution.\r\n\r\nThe research showed that CIE2K
    was conceived as a display font, not intended for use at small sizes, or for station
    signage for that matter. Regardless of the aesthetic qualities of the font, it
    suffered greatly from regular misuse and inappropriate application. Irish Rail
    had received negative feedback from staff and customers about the font's legibility.
    A vivid example was the truck driver who crashed into a railway overpass and claimed
    he could not read warning signs (set in CIE2K) of the height restrictions. \r\n\r\nWith
    six different weights, I felt that CIE2K was too complex for use as a cross platform
    corporate identity font. My redesign, \u2018Nexus Sans\u2019, specified just three
    weights to make it easier to use and added basic glyphs such as the euro currency
    symbol as well as optional tabular figures for setting timetables.\r\n\r\nMy redesign
    sought to keep the references to brush-drawn Gaelic calligraphy, while making
    letterforms and letter-spacing more consistent. The font is now comfortable to
    read at small sizes and less idiosyncratic in appearance.\r\n\r\nI also recommended
    that \u2018Nexus Sans\u2019 be restricted to printed corporate communications,
    and that a separate font should be considered for the special requirements of
    online and signage typography.\r\n\r\nOne year after I had finished and named
    the font, Martin Majoor released his beautiful \u2018Nexus Sans\u2019 in 2004.
    An unfortunate coincidence, but not significant since the Irish Rail corporate
    font is not sold commercially, and I hope people would think better of comparing
    such dissimilar designs.\r\n\r\nThe Creative Inc website shows some examples of
    Irish Rail Nexus Sans and the excellent Brunel font used for station signage.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativeinc.ie/index.php/portfolio/detail/iarnrod_eireann/#\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nexus_sans_preview_4398.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NexSans_use_ticket_not_record_6465.jpg]"
