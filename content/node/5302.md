body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a dual processor G5 under OSX with Suitcase
  as a fontmanager. But this programm S&#42;&#42;KS bigtime. Are there other fontmanagers
  that do work? I heard some different stories but would like to know your experience.
  <BR>A lot of people install their fonts ones and never touch them again. I touch
  and change them multiple times a week and have always problems with Suitcase. I
  have to run the super freeware &#39;Font Cache Cleaner&#39; every time I want to
  put a font in Suitcase. When I don&#39;t Suitcase won&#39;t make the font active
  or deactivate other fonts. Why? Only Suitcase knows? <BR> <BR>There must be an much
  better way to work with fonts under OSX. Help please before I trade in my G5 for
  a Classic. <BR> <BR>

  body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>I had a good look at all the reviews and are currently checking
    the demoversion of FontAgent Pro. I must say that is for me already a 100% improvement.
    I think I will stick with this. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, thanks for your help. <BR> <BR>
