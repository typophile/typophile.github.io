body: "Hey technicians,\r\n\r\nA fontfamily of twelve styles seems to work just fine
  in Indesign. Indesign won't let me export a pdf when the fontfamily is used, though.
  After a while I found the Italic style was causing the problem. Then I found out,
  the opentype features in the Italic style are causing the problem. So Italic without
  opentype feature works fine, and is exportable to pdf, but Italic with opentype
  feature isn't.\r\n\r\nThing is, the opentype features in all styles have been imported
  from the same .fea file (except the 'kern' feature of course). I've been trying
  to solve this issue for two entire days now, so all help is much appreciated! I'm
  kinda desperate here...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\njasper\r\n"

  body: Yes. I'm not sure why the problem was only visible in the Italic (might have
    something to do with Indesign) but the smcp feature (the opentype classes it involved,
    to be precise) contained a few glyph names which were not actually in the fontfile.
    I had created the smcp feature before I deleted the glyphs, and forgot to remove
    them from the opentype class. When I deleted them, everything worked again :)
