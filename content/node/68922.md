  sans serif it says \"The first sans serifs, characterised (like Flat Face before
  them) by absence of serifs...\" I was just wondering what a flat face was? Would
  they technically be the first sans serif typefaces even before caslon's sans?\r\n\r\nI
  tried googleing didn't go so well and search appears to be broken\r\n\r\nany links
  or info would be greatly appriciated, thanks"

  body: "That's a typographic error and mis-spelling.\r\nFat Faces were a genre of
    ultra-heavy serifed type designs introduced in the early 19th century, arguably
    the first of the new commercial (job-printing for businesses) styles that evolved
    to meet marketing needs, rather than those of book-publishing."

  body: "It could be said that the original Egyptian (aka Antique) faces of the early
    19th century had \"flat\" or unbracketed serifs.\r\nAlso, the centre stem of cap
    E, for instance, in that genre, had no serif."
