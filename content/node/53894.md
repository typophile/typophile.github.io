  sign I photographed was an obvious choice because it represents one of my favorite
  places in New Orleans, Frenchy's gallery on Oak Street. A friend of mine manages
  the gallery and I love hanging out there. The sign itself is painted by Frenchy
  in his bright, unique style that is purely New Orleans. The gallery is a place that
  could only be found in this city, where tourists and regulars alike stop by to drink,
  smoke, bullshit, and bang away on the artist's paint-splattered piano, and I think
  the almost crude, handmade sign perfectly captures the style of Frenchy's paintings
  and the mood of his gallery.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jaquessign_3432.jpg]\r\nAnother
  New Orleans institution close to my heart is Jacques-Imo's. Jacques's is also on
  Oak Street; in fact, it's right across the street from Frenchy's and next door to
  the Maple Leaf Bar. The close proximity of these three locations to each other and
  to my apartment has created a Bermuda Triangle of fun that's almost ruined my college
  career several times. Though I don't think the sign captures the feel of Jacques's
  as much as the painted pick-up truck permanently parked outside the restaurant,
  I must give it credit for being truly New Orleanian in its colors and fleur-de-lis
  symbols. The strings of Christmas lights and red and blue spotlights around the
  sign hint at the restaurant's potential for crazy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/teeevassign2_6049.jpg]\r\nI
  have never been to Tee-Eva's, and now that it is up for sale, I guess I never will
  get a snoball there, but I still have the fond memories of stumbling past this bright
  building on late Thursday nights. The whole front of the building is a sign for
  Tee-Eva's Creole Soul Food and I think it's one of the best signs in town. It's
  certainly eye-catching. To me, the vibrant colors represent fun and laughter and
  everything good food and New Orleans are about and I wish I could have eaten there
  once instead of just stumbling by.\r\n\r\n"
