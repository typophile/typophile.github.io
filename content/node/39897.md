  that I absolutely adore.  I actually came across its name by pure luck while browsing
  a book on graphic design, but have since forgotten its name.  Can anyone help?\r\n\r\nExample:

  body: A slightly different version was digitized by Richard Beatty as <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Spiral">Spiral</a>.
    It's available with two sets of caps.

  body: Believe it or not, in the middle of the night I suddenly remembered "Kismet!"  I
    felt rather dumb for wasting people's time with the post.  But Spiral is new to
    me, and, at first blush, seems to be more complete than Kismet, what with slashes
    and other punctuation fully integrated into the design.  Very interesting, thanks!
