body: "Not strictly type related, but I figure there must be plenty of Acrobat users
  here. At any rate, this is less off-topic than birdhouse carpentry [ahem], so here
  goes:\r\n\r\nI use Acrobat Pro 7, and often need to use the \"Print with comments
  summary\" feature. This always launches with paper size set to \"letter\" and layout
  set to \"Document and comments with sequence numbers on separate pages\". But I
  <em>always</em> want \"A4\" and \"Document and comments with connector lines on
  single pages\". Anybody know if there's a way I can make this the default? Some
  preferences file or suchlike?\r\n\r\n[If anybody's thinking, \"Why not ask an Adobe
  question in the Adobe user forums?\", the answer is that I <em>did</em>, in <em>October</em>;
  since I got diddly response I thought I'd try elsewhere.]"

  body: "You'd think, wouldn't you?\r\nI can't double-check until Monday (as this
    is at work), but I'm pretty sure I scoured up and down the options in the Prefs
    dialog box and there was nothing about this feature. Besides, if it had been as
    simple as that, someone at the Adobe forum would've said so, surely!"

  body: "That just takes me via another route to the settings for changing <em>that
    specific job</em>; it doesn't <em>stick</em> (well, it sticks while you keep the
    app open, but I want more stickiness than that!). What I was hoping for was something
    that would change the default so that I wouldn't <em>have</em> to go into these
    settings dialogs every time.\r\n\r\nEven the wording of the help file tells you
    to set the layout options you want when you go into the 'Summarize Comments' or
    'Print with comments summary; menu items, suggesting that there isn't a way to
    have <em>pre-set</em> the layout options that you know you're going to want every
    time. \r\n\r\nGrrr."

  body: Thanks David; couldn't see a way to contact that guy directly, but I've signed
    up to the Acrobat Users community forum and re-asked the question there. I've
    a horrible feeling the answer is going to involve writing some JavaScript or something
    like that...
