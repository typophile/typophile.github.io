  body: "Thanks, Paul. I'm still wondering about that serif font.\r\n\r\nAnother thing
    that is driving me bonkers is that \"s\". Check out this Edwardian Sample, and
    compare it to the above. It's that \"line\" on the left side and the way it intersects
    the terminal:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_5054.png]\r\n\r\nWhat
    seems to be going on here?\r\n\r\nThanks for helping!"

  body: Just a thought, but does that line belong to the "n"? Note that on that window,
    it does not smoothly continue into the top of the "s" after the intersection.
    Maybe the lettering on your window is just more tightly spaced than the sample?
    But I don't have the font, so can't check.

  body: "Are you trying to replicate the effect? Looks like they put some negative
    tracking on the \"U\" and \"n\" to create the overlap. As you can see below the
    line is coming from the \"n\" pulled slightly inside the \"s\". Try about -50
    to -100 tracking on the \"n\" to duplicate.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3d39800a8d59490ceb91dad0fbc03c_5771.gif]"
