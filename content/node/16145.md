  body: "Wow... in so many ways reminiscent of my old \"Baby Book\" my parents kept
    with pictures of the first few years of my life. Entirely wood front and back
    covers with large raised wood letters and painted wooden lamb on the cover. (Sniffle,
    sniffle)\r\n"

  body: "Never heard of the expression \"bound in boards\"?\r\n\r\nBooks were actually
    bound in wood plank, for a much much longer time than they have been bound in
    composite paper board. \r\n\r\nUCLA has a fairly comprehensive collection of the
    Aldine output. Unless it was rebound in the mid to late 19th century or later,
    those covers are wood covered with leather.\r\n\r\nGerald"
