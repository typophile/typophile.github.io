body: "I'm having trouble figuring out a thing in FontLab. I'm trying to copy all
  the kerning data from one of my fonts to another one, but it's not working right.
  I go into the class kerning panel and click \"Copy classes from a font\", but it
  only copies the classes, not the actual kerning numbers. So when I test the kerning,
  none of the letters kern at all.\r\n\r\nBut with some of my fonts it does work.
  Particularly, it works with the ones where the letters are all in the right order
  in the font window, which is to say they're alphabetical. In the ones where it doesn't
  work, the letters are all jumbled around once you get out of Latin-1 (sample: \u0154\u0102\u0139\u0106\u010C\u0118\u011A\u010E\u0110\u0143\u0147\u0150\u0158\u016E\u0170\u0162).
  Actually the weird part is that on one of the two fonts where it worked, the letters
  are jumbled, although in that font I remember they've been ordered before; I don't
  know when it changed.\r\n\r\nHow can I get the letters in the right order, and more
  importantly, how can I get the kerning to copy from one font to the other? Is it
  something to do with encoding? Because I really don't understand that well.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Kerning Copy/Paste and import options are buggy; the more pairs you have
    the worse it gets. IIRC Karsten Lucke has written some scripts for doing this
    stuff correctly, it might be worthwhile to ask him about them.\r\n\r\nBut I highly
    recommend that you just license Metrics Machine and not kern in Fontlab at all."

  body: MetricsMachine looks great, but I don't have that kind of money! I'll see
    if I can get a hold of Karsten, I suppose. But any other suggestions, I'd still
    love to hear them.

  body: "There's the <strong>kern table,</strong> which is what you're editing in
    the Metrics Window, and is for pre-OpenType fonts (mainly), and then there's the
    <strong>kern feature,</strong> which is a separate thing for OpenType fonts. You
    can generate the kern feature from the kern table using Kerning Assistance ->
    Update [kern] Feature. You can go the other direction with the \"Expand\" button,
    but this is not the best way to do what you want to do.\r\n\r\nHere's what to
    do: With the first font, open the Metrics Window, click the \"Save Metrics\" button
    (second from the left at the top). This will create an .afm file, which is a text
    file containing metrics and kerning info. Now switch to the other font, open the
    Metrics Window, and click on the \"Open Metrics\" button (top left) and choose
    the .afm file you just created. A warning message will appear, reminding you to
    make sure you know what you're doing. (It's a good idea to save the font before
    doing this.) If you click \"Continue\", it will ask you which data you want to
    import from the .afm file. Choose \"Do nothing\", \"Completely replace kerning
    data in current font\", and \"Do nothing\" from the three popups. The second font
    will now contain a kern table identical to the first font.\r\n\r\nYou will probably
    also want to import the kerning classes from the other font in the Classes panel."

  body: "Another method: \r\n\r\nIn the source font, save the OpenType Layout features
    into a .fea text file (using the OpenType panel popup menu). \r\n\r\nIn the target
    font: \r\n1. Open the OpenType Layout features from that .fea text file (using
    the OpenType panel popup menu). \r\n2. Compile the OpenType Layout features (using
    the Compile button on the OpenType panel). \r\n3. Open the Preview panel, OpenType
    Features tab, and click on the \"Import kerning from [kern] feature\" button.
    \r\n\r\nAlternatively (if you have the same classes set up in both fonts), in
    the source font you can just generate a \"kern\" feature, then copy-paste the
    \"kern\" feature definition from the source font's OpenType panel into the target
    font's, then compile the features in the target font and use the \"Import kerning
    from [kern] feature\" button on the OpenType Features tab of the Preview panel.
    \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    font, they get wiped from the class table with no warning. Always save classes
    and load them in the target font. That way you are given to option to ignore missing
    glyphs or generate them.'
