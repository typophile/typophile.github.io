body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI've been reading a lot about typefaces and how different
  kinds can be combined in order to create layers of meaning. Type foundries usually
  suggest pairings for their own fonts, most notably Hoefler & Frere Jones and Font
  Bureau. I am looking to create an unusual mix of moods for a personal branding project:\r\n\r\n-
  Hearty, friendly\r\n- Weird, quirky\r\n- Contemplative, dramatic\r\n\r\nYou can
  think of this mix as the equivalent of a Wes Anderson, Sylvain Chomet, or even a
  Spike Jonze film. Sort of like what film critic Peter Rainer writes about Spike
  Jonze's film, Being John Malkovich:\r\n\u201CIt is hard to mix moods -- the film
  is manic, subtle, comic and vaguely sad -- but [Jonze] does it masterfully.\u201D\r\n\r\nI
  looked at a lot of high-quality typefaces, one of which is H&FJ's Sentinel. I think
  it has that (hearty, friendly) edge to it alright, but I am looking to mix it up
  with other typefaces in order to give it those other layers I want to incorporate.
  Check out my attached file to see a sample letterhead for Sentinel. I feel that
  Sentinel is a good text font, but I am open to other suggestions. Whatever your
  other options are, I also want your thoughts on how I can keep it all consistent
  on printed as well as web platforms."

    is a better choice than Sentinel, IMHO.\r\nCheck out the contrasts as it is used
    for <a href=\"http://getperka.com\">Perka</a>.\r\n\r\nI think you have to go to
    such extremes to create contrast with a slab serif face, because they are so strong
    that the usual serif vs. sans method doesn\u2019t work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your reply Nick.\r\nPerhaps Sentinel isn't weird/quirky on
    its own, but I was hoping to add a font or two to it in order to get the layers
    I want. I'm thinking of it like an x + y = z type of equation.\r\nAlthough it
    sounds weird, I was thinking of using Century Schoolbook (or Grad) for the body
    text, Trade Gothic Bold Condensed for sub-headers, and (Futura Extra Bold??) as
    my main name font. Any thoughts on that?"

    think Perka is using any Turnip, Nick. That mostly looks like variations of Freight.
    \r\n\r\nFreight Micro (as in the logotype) is easily confused with Turnip, especially
    in lower-res environments."
