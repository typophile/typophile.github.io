  body: I wondered about the M too but maybe they just customized that character.
    Doesn't look like Gill to me.

  body: That M matches <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">Gotham</a>,
    but I have the impression the waist of the R is too high.

  body: I think Yves is right about it being Avenir, and I think they modified the
    M to match their logo.
