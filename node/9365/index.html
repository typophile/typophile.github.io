		<div class="commentbody">Me too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I &quot;knew&quot; Justin mostly in that virtual online sense, though we met briefly once or twice at conferences. I gave him some tips on OpenType development, and he asked lots of very reasonable questions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recently Adobe had an issue with our next-gen apps and ITC Founders Caslon, which he was a great help in debugging. It turned out to be something I decided to fix on our end, but he would have been happy to revise his fonts if it would help. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justin was always friendly, courteous, intellectually engaged, and when it came to design/technology decisions quite focused on the actual users of his typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My last non-mass email from him was two weeks ago today. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It all feels very unreal, somehow. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goodbye, Justin. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sent from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Friends of St Bride<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A service of thanksgiving for Justin's life will be held in St Bride <!-- raw HTML omitted -->church on 9 May 2005 at 3pm. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justin was one of the strongest supporters of the Friends and his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->untimely death will be keenly felt. He was responsible for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->re-establishing the Friends in 1998 and was our Chairman until 2003. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since then Justin has continued to support us, giving gifts to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->library up to a few weeks ago. Without Justin the Friends would simply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not exist and we will always be indebted to him. The Friends was not the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only cause that Justin championed. It was largely thanks to his efforts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that the archives of the Sheffield based typefounders Stephenson Blake <!-- raw HTML omitted -->were preserved in the Type Museum. Until recently Justin also worked in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Type Museum as part-time curator. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Always busy with many projects, Justin always found the time to share <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his knowledge with others and many of us will miss his help and advice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as well as his friendship. Over the years he made many contributions in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the field of printing history beginning with articles in Matrix and Isis <!-- raw HTML omitted -->while studying as an undergraduate at Christ Church College, Oxford. He <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then edited Edward Johnston's Lessons in formal writing with Heather <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Child, published by Lund Humphries in 1986. A year later he published a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->catalogue of the Edward Johnston Collection at the Crafts Study Centre <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at Bath University. He remained fascinated by Johnston and later wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Johnston's underground type, published by Capital Transport in 2000. He <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also published in numerous journals and lectured across the country and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->abroad on a number of different subjects. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justin was a typographer as well as a printing historian. He was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->responsible for designing many books, some quite sumptuous, but will be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->remembered in particular for his masterful digital version of the Caslon <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps the saddest thing about Justin's death is that he left so many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->projects unfinished, some of which had been long-term ambitions that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->were soon to bear fruit &ndash; his six-month stay at the Plantin-Moretus <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Museum in Antwerp and his PhD on the development of letterforms and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->concepts of lettering, 1680–1830 to name but two. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our thoughts are with his parents at this time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justin's obituary in The Times: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1-45-1505298%2C00.html,http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-45-1505298,00.html<!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
