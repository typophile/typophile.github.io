  body: Oh... <BR> <BR>An apart from having a great cover design, the Rascal is highly
    recomendable if your are in to that whole grimey-UK garage-hip to the hop-kind&#39;a
    thang. The Boy is awesome &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.dizzeerascal.co.uk"

  body: I must say, it may be because he was hyped so much that  <BR>I was a bit underwhelmed
    when I finally got to listen to the  <BR>album. I think he&#39;s <i>very good</i>,
    don&#39;t misunderstand me, but  <BR>I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s the earth-shattering
    revolution in garage music  <BR>people claimed it was. <BR>Killer album cover
    indeed. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    target="_blank"> Identikal</a> or <a href="http://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/"

    But it&#39;s custom designed by <a href="http://wehaveaproblem.com/webfiles/exhibitions/drury/trustmelondon.html">Ben
    Drury</a> of Mo&#39;wax fame.

  body: I always found his sound to be just too eccentric, too exhausting.. Then again
    I never really spent any time with the album. And I <i>did</i> warm up to The
    Streets eventually as well, so I&#39;ll give him another shot.. Thanks for the
    reminder! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Ah, The Streets! Now <i>that</i> guy is worth the hype! <BR><a href="http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/streets/agranddontcomeforfree/"
    target="_blank"> A Grand Don&#39;t Come For Free</a> is by far the best and funniest  <BR>concept
    album I ever heard! Great stuff, both musical and lyrical.
