    discussion is about RoboFab, a Python library that can be added to FontLab to
    make it easier to script. In particular, some of the comments are from type designers
    telling how they use scripting in font development.\r\n\r\n(The Typographica article
    is old, and unfortunately the images seem to be broken.)"
