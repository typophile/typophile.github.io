    number (U+03A9). One glyph per code is the max.'

  body: "If the glyphs are exactly the same, remove/delete one or reassign as the
    Ohm (electrical resistance) sign (code U+2126), if the font doesn't have one already.\r\n\r\nIf
    they differ, consider which one is a better Omega, then proceed as above.\r\n\r\nAside:
    The Mho (electrical conductance) sign has the code U+2127 and is an upside-down
    Ohm sign."
