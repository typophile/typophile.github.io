    related to Dutch specimen work, try John Lane or Mathieu Lommen. Jan Middendorp
    is also an expert on the Dutch scene. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Something just hit me: any test string with &#34;Hamburg&#34; in it is unlikely
    to have originated from the Netherlands, for the simple reason that the Dutch
    have never been particulary fond of Germans, especially not after WWII. It must
    have come from a German font house, and considering that blackletter -which was
    used almost exclusively in Germany until about the middle of WWII- has very different
    control characters than roman, I&#39;d guess that that famous test string is from
    the 1950s. In fact it also seems to me to be the sort of analytical stuff Zapf
    might have played a part in. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: "Dear Hrant, [[Hermann Zapf]] is not the inventor of \"Hambergevons.\" However,
    because of your post, I asked him what he knew about it. He believes\u2014quite
    credibly, I might add\u2014that the word was created as a test at the [[D. Stempel
    AG]] foundry, before the Second World War. \r\n\r\nThe \"author\" would then be
    [[Dr. Rudolf Wolf]] (died 1942), who among other things was the designer of the
    Memphis type family. [[August Rosenberger]] may have been involved as well. Rosenberger
    cut several of Memphis' weights, and would later cut designs of Hermann Zapf's,
    including Palatino.\r\n\r\n[[Otmar Hoefer]] addes to me that this was by no means
    a universal word. The \"Americans\" used to begin a typeface with the letters
    <strong>Hono</strong>."
