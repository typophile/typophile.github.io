  aspect I need vectors of a few of his logos. I've searched various online logo \"databases\"
  (brands of the world, etc.) but I can't seem to find anything. \r\nDoes anybody
  have (or know where to get) such vectors?"

    images online or make scans.\r\n\r\nYou could also check with the reference department
    at your local library. They may be be able to obtain a book of his logos (like
    the one below) via interlibrary loan.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book_3977.jpg]"

    raster based file formats 'rasters', do we?\r\n\r\nSorry for derailing the thread.
    Not sure why that irks me so. "

- body: "aluminum, I think it's because a vector is actually a mathematical path,
    and we tend to think of a path itself as a noun. A path == a vector.\r\n\r\nMost
    people don't think of \"raster\" as a noun -- I bet most Adobe users immediately
    think of 'rasterize' as a verb. The resulting pixel is a noun, but pixels are
    expressed simply as \"image\" or \"picture\". Calling an image a 'vector' sets
    it apart from pixels. If there was a 'vectorize' command in Adobe products, using
    'vector' as a noun might never have caught on. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, your irk is
    completely understandable. I get irked every time I hear people use the word \"ironic\"
    improperly."

    reason we call \"automobiles\" \"autos\" and \"telephones\" \"phones\". The examples
    are endless."
