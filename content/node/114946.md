  body: "Hi Thomas. Just a tip for future reference. When posting a font ID request
    don't SHOUT in your title. Use the title as an opportunity to catch the attention
    of font detectives who have to wade through many posts. You could have said: Sans
    with rounded ends and gaps.\r\nIt also helps if you say where you found your image:
    logo, website, advert, old book etc. and the approximate date.\r\nIf it is a logo,
    a reasonable facsimile could be made by taking a font such as Lawyer Gothic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/abstrkt/lawyer-gothic/
    Proxima Nova Soft  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova-soft/
    or Centrale Sans Rounded http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typedepot/centrale-sans-rounded/
    \ and making adjustments such as cutting a gap in top left corner of P and R to
    match your image.\r\n\r\nDon"
