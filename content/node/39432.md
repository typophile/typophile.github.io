  the Caslon Sans Serif of William Caslon IV, dated 1816, in a 1997 class supervised
  by Tobas Frere-Jones. Does anyone know more about this? Is this digitized Caslon
  Sans available somewhere?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\ndr"

  body: "David, I know of several versions. First there\u2019s James Mosley\u2019s
    own Tivoli type, which is a an autotraced version from scans turned into a Type
    1 font. I think it works very well for single words, it was used in the Italian
    book <cite>Radici della Scrittura Moderna</cite> which is a collection of translation
    of James\u2019 own essays on typography, including <cite>The Nymph and the Grot</cite>
    (<a href=\"http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html\">recently
    updated</a>) where he introduced the history of sanserif types.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing
    Mosley\u2019s Tivoli I decided to have a go myself and produced my own version,
    called Micerino (Italian name of the smallest \u2013 as in \u201Csmall character
    set, uppercase only\u201D \u2013 pyramid in the Giza complex). It\u2019s quite
    rough around the edges as to spacing and kerning. Some glyphs need review, too,
    but it\u2019s almost usable. I included the alternate forms found in the two specimens
    I was given by James and \u0152 \xC6 ligatures as OpenType features/stylistic
    sets.\r\n\r\nThe Font Bureau version is definitely the way to go if you want something
    more usable. It has several weights and a lowercase, although it\u2019s more loosely
    based on the original from what I\u2019ve seen. I think it\u2019s a reasonable
    type, especially considering it was done for a contemporary magazine so it\u2019s
    natural that some of the features in the original type had to be somewhat muted.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.moderntypography.com/\">Paul Barnes\u2019 home page</a> used
    to feature a specimen of what looked like his own digitization on Caslon\u2019s
    Two Lines English Egyptian. I know nothing about it, apart from what I saw online,
    so I\u2019m not sure about it, but you could try asking. <a href=\"http://www.idiidiiidesign.at/\">Martin
    Tiefenthaler</a> from Vienna recently wrote me about it, and I think he\u2019s
    enquiring Paul as well as per my suggestion."

  body: "As the only English sans serif lower case letters that were around during
    the first half of the 19th century were Bold Condensed, an \"accurate revival\"
    of a Regular style from that era is impossible. \r\n\r\nThere are other considerations
    today. For instance, in the Figgins lower case I contemplated giving the top of
    the \"f\" a substantial overhang, which I thought would be appropriate for that
    era, but decided against that in a 21st century international face, where the
    \"f\" is followed by all sorts of accented characters.\r\n\r\nNote that the early
    19th century \"G\" is problematic, and very few new faces in the style of that
    era follow the model authentically.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    book I published with Coach House Books in 1997 entitled \"Head Paintings\". I
    added lowercase letters, numbers and punctuation. The book is now out of print
    but copies can occasionally be found at www.abebooks.com. You can see the full
    font at my website: www.robertfones.com. I have to confess that I found the combination
    of uppercase and lowercase very awkward and have never used the font since. No

    in the New York Times magazine."
