  looks like it might be used on the old-fashioned flipping train schedule signs in
  European train stations. I''m looking for images of these signs online but if anyone
  could suggest an existing typeface I would be grateful. My sense is that a sans
  serif that is horizontally split is in order.  thank you. '

    you'll find something closer that we can then try to match."
