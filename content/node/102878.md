  airplanes' registration.\r\n\r\nI thought DIN and Arial Monospaced would be a good
  start. But DIN doesn't match at all and I am not really satisfied with Arial either.
  \r\n\r\nDoesn't anyone here have a better idea which might be used (see attached
  image)?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nChristian[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek-reg-font_6524.png]"
