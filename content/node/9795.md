  body: After that last discussion, I was trying to work an interobang into a poster
    for the advertising department at my school as a joke but was thwarted by the
    fact that no one knows what it means. It was   actually very disappointing to
    end up with just a plain old question mark.

  body: Hey, is there precedent for calling an exclamation mark a  <BR>&#34;bang&#34;?
    Is that the etymology of &#34;interrobang&#34;?

  body: Also &#34;bang&#34; is used by nerds to describe the exclamation point as
    well, viz. &#34;bang path&#34; for old UUCP-style internet addresses. See also
    &#34;hash&#34;, &#34;pound&#34;, &#34;twiddle&#34;, &#34;splat&#34;, etc.
