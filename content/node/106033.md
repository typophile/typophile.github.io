body: A webpage nameplate. The word Partnership looks like a roman set in all caps,
  but not Trajan. The words "Job" and "Board" appear to me slightly lighter in weight
  and some kind of Didone, font leg of 'R' is different in 'Partnership' and in 'Board'.
  Be sure to refer to the attachment to see the complete set of words. Don't know
  provenance and no time at this moment to swim upstream for other source files. TIA
  a lot. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/thepartnership_job_board_5816.gif]

  body: "Thanks Ryuk,\r\n\r\nI think you're right. I've decided not to spend time
    trying to match \"Job Board\" and just go ahead with Lucida Bright for now. Maybe
    change this at some point in the future\u2026"
