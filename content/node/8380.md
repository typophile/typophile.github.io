body: I uploaded this to MyFont and it gave me MT Ashley | Xavier, but I know there
  is another name. It seems that there is one in the BT collection that I have. Does
  anyone know another alias? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56769.gif"

    target="_blank">Letraset Xylo</a>, but those are the only names I know. BTW, isn&#39;t
    the Ashley actually Ashley Crawford?

    by Image Club in 1991. It was subsquently renamed Ashley Crawford to correspond
    with a licensing agreement through Agfa Monotype.
