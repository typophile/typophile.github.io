    on the A, is distinctive too.  \r\n\r\nVery nice...."

  body: It's kind of frightening when you look at it low res, though. The line weight
    seemed visually unbalanced, while in construction it may be truly monoline; you
    know, like the infamous Century Gothic.

  body: Keep in mind I snapped this from a Flash file. The original shows none of
    the inconsistencies you see here. Next time you're at Target, pick up a weighty
    ice cream scoop (a joy in itself) and look at the label to see what I mean.

  body: Mostra has a similar look, but the proportions are different in some of the
    letters (M and N, especially), completely different S (all three of them), and
    Mostra is more strictly geometric (by design).

  body: "Steuf--I supose that is why the horizontal strokes look so heavy? I guess
    Flash (like film) is best kept moving so that its flaws are less evident. As for
    the proportions, either Futura, Proxima Nova, or Gill Sans proportions (width
    of glyphs) seem far superior to what I can see of this example.  The original,
    in all its hi-rez glory, may be better but that I can't tell from this sample.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Chris you are correct, Flash is meant for an interactive/animation environment.
    I'm pretty sure that the way Flash renders out type changes the actual bezier
    structure by 'simplifying' it, thus changing the actual structure of the glyphs
    creating the idiosyncrasies that we are seeing in the stroke modulation.

    comment. To my non-designer's eye, this looks like an adaptation of Futura. Use
    the G to make the C; make a new flat-sided M with a high crotch, bring in the
    legs on the A and V, maybe do a little 'squooshing', and most of us couldn't tell
    the difference without side-by-side nit-picking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
