  of courier.\r\n\r\nThis is the only image I could find on the web(I dont have access
  to a scanner).\r\nTake a look at the small type above the words \"BILONGO.\"\r\n\r\nAnyhelp
  would be great.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\n\r\nBookie\r\n\r\n"

  body: My guess is that it's customized... it's almost a very light version of the
    proprietary Ben&Jerry's font.  The lower case o's don't seem to match up.

  body: It's similar to <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rough-lt/bold/testdrive.html?s=A+third+collection+of+modern+afro&p=48
    target="new">Rough </a>. Not having a larger picture, it's hard to say how similar.
    Hope it helps.

    achieve the same rough, unique effect by doing it yourself."
