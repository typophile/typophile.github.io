    font that includes this precise variation.\r\nIf all else fails you could take
    Kris Sowersby's Founders Grotesk SemiBold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FoundersGroteskSemiBoldAsALL_5808.jpg]
    \ from Klim https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/founders-grotesk/ and clip terminals

  body: "There is a match, without editing, to Lining Gothic 545 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LiningGothic545_5766.jpg]
    created originally by American Typefounders or to one of the almost identical
    clones produced by most major foundries.\r\nAFAIK there is no digital revival.
    However this image provides a full character set and can be used to select substitutes.\r\nDon"
