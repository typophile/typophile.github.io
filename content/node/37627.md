  rings) should look in a Didonic typeface? Does it have contrast? It should somehow
  match the dagger sign as we use it together in genealogy charts.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance,\r\n\r\nGeorg"

    from Computer Modern (the LaTeX font).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmu-genealogical_4871.png]\r\n\r\nNote
    that they use the Latin Cross (U+271D) rather than the Dagger for death symbol.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJens"
