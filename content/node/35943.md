  \"Puss in Boots\" and fits the story beautifully. (On the plus side, of the 76 books
  I needed to identify typefaces in, it was one of only two I have failed on.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/puss

    Garamont has a surprisingly slanted \"e\" crossbar, which this sample does not.
    Thanks for the thought, though!\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "IDK about the long legs. I'm looking at Lanston's Garamont, but I can't tell
    so much from the P22 page.\r\n\r\nNot Fabiol. That \"s\" is so odd and open.\r\n\r\nSo
    that book was published in 1990. Could have been a photoset font\u2014compugraphics
    or something."

    because I'm pretty sure it's some flavor of Garamond, I just can't figure out
    which one. The cap A has a very subtle slight Garamond \"indent\" at the top left,
    for instance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    type with the stepped W (besides the Monotype Garamont, which doesn't seem to
    match your sample very well), and that is Ludlow Garamond. It has symmetrical
    T serifs, unlike most other Garamond's (and Garamont). What does your book's T

    or subtly asymmetric with the opposite slant from most Garamonds. But the \"f\"
    in Ludlow Garamond is distinctively stunted, which it is not quite so much in
    this typeface. Also the \"j\" is notably different.\r\n\r\nDang. Thanks for trying,
    though. \r\n\r\nT"

    try using the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a>? It's mostly digital fonts, but many have pre-digital origins.
    If you have most of the letters there it ought to be simple to pick those that
    are least ambiguous in terms of the Key letter choices in the Guide.\r\n\r\n-

    Based on the narrowness of the 'a', I'd say it's 16 point. Strangely enough, I've
    digitized a-z and a few caps of this one, just for fun. I think my digitization
    is based on the 14pt, but I could go dig up the scan to make sure.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/estienne_5065.png]"

    the A and the big open P. The x-height/ascender/descender lengths are a better
    match than anything mentioned before.\r\n\r\nI hadn't gotten that far into the
