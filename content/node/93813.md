body: "Help!\r\n\r\n I'm looking for two different 'Simplified Chinese web fonts',
  for use on a new Chinese version of an english fashion site.\r\n\r\n1. A Title/display
  font \u2013 Similar to 'modern' or 'bodoni' (if this is even possible, as i guess
  you don't have Chinese characters with serifs)\r\n2. A Body copy Font \u2013 Similar
  to 'Gill Sans' or other classic san serifs, with a set of different weights.\r\n\r\nSo
  if anyone has any advice or pointers on selecting a chinese font (technical or aesthetic)
  that would be great.\r\n\r\ncheers, \r\nCian\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Riccardo (and ken lunde) for the links and tips, very helpful.\r\n\r\nI
    think we're going for 'SimHei' for body copy as it seems to be the most widely
    used chinese web font.\r\n\r\nand for Heads/titles a 'song' variant, using monotype's
    font subsetting system to keep the file size down. "

      contains \"Microsoft Yahei\" which is designed and hinted for screen display.
      It also contains a bold variant.\r\nMacOS X has Hiragino Sans GB W3/W7 and HeiTi
      SC [Light]."

  body: "So we have now chosen our (body copy) simplified chinese web font... 'Hei'.
    \ \r\n\r\nBut I was wondering what the family name is for 'hei' in chinese characters?
    as we imagine the chinese world would use chinese characters in the css? or maybe
    'hei' would be OK and we don't need to specify in chinese characters.  \r\n\r\nAlso
    any suggestions on a professional version of Hei for all our printed material
    and graphics etc.?\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your generous replies!"

  body: "Hi Again \u2013 After half a year we are now ready to start coding/testing
    the new site with 'Hei' as our system font but this is what the web developers
    have coded in for 'hei':\r\n\r\n \"Microsoft YaHei\",\"\u5FAE\u8F6F\u96C5\u9ED1\",
    Arial, \"Verdana\", sans-serif, STXihei,\"\u534E\u6587\u7EC6\u9ED1\r\n\r\nI feel
    this hierarchy/font stack could be improved? reasons being:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Firstly,
    I don't have either of these 'hei' versions on my mac. So I think we should consider
    that...\r\n\r\n\u2013 Secondly, I imagine there are better versions of  'Hei'
    than 'microsoft yahei' that should be higher on the list.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
    here?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nSullivan\r\n "

  body: "For fonts on MacOS X:\r\n\r\nSTXihei literally means \"ST Hei Light\". Do
    you have any other font named like \"STHeiti\"? Anyway, I heard STXihei is the
    standard font in Windows Phone, so it might need to be there.\r\nPerhaps you can
    consider giving Hiragino Sans GB a go? It should be in any MacOS X installation,
    I think.\r\n\r\nFor fonts on Windows:\r\n\r\nYou can try SimHei/\u9ED1\u4F53.
    You can even try SimYou/\u5E7C\u5706 if you dare to use a rounded sans-serif here...\r\nHowever,
    I think Microsoft Yahei is already the best you can get for Windows. And to be
    fair, it's manually hinted to details, and looks quite good in Windows with ClearType
    on."

    STXihei is indeed given the name STHeiti Light, which makes it hard to see that
