body: Hello <BR> <BR>I have spent the last month reading up on the private press movement
  in England in the late 19th and early 20th century, and as I am sure most of you
  know, much of the type developed for these presses was based on Jenson&#39;s work.  <BR>
  <BR>I have been looking for books about Jenson and his work, but I can&#39;t find
  much. Anyone come across anything good? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim

    Nicolas Jenson and the Rise of the Roman Letterform</i> by M Lowery. It serves
    double-duty as a thoughtful history and a specimen of George Abram&#39;s Venetian
    type &#40;George also contributed an essay&#41;. The text is in English and Danish.
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, copies online appear to be selling for $250 or more. I
    found my copy by chance in a second-hand bookshop on Evanston, Illinois, for a
    <i>lot</i> less than that.'

  body: Thanks John, I had come across that book, but as you say, it is very expensive.
    It seems odd that his work, which has inspired so many faces, has very little
    written about it.  <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===

  body: There&#39;s quite a lot written in books on early printing and typography
    in general, and you&#39;re sure to find stuff in journals, e.g. <i>The Journal
    of the Printing Historical Association</i>. There just seem to be few books completely
    devoted to Jenson. I seem to recall seeing a biography at the St Bride Printing
    Library, but can&#39;t remember the details.

  body: thanks John <BR> <BR>I am planning to spend a few days in London in January,
    so I&#39;ll hopefully be able to get in to St Brides for a good look through their
    books. <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: Please forgive this hijacking, but what do you think of Abram&#39;s types
    Mr. Hudson? I&#39;ve read that his Garamond was superior to any other in his day,
    but when the digital version was released, I heard very little about it. Just
    interested. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: 'I like George&#39;s Augereau &#40;Garamond&#41; and Venetian types. They&#39;re
    both very clean, elegant book faces. His Augereau may have been a superior typeface
    to many other &#39;Garamonds&#39;, but I have trouble classifying it as a Garamond:
    there are too many features of the design that are radically different from anything
    that either Augereau or Garamond cut, e.g. this uppercase R: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56311.gif"
    alt="Abram&#39;s Augereau R"> <BR> <BR>It is beautiful and a very accomplished
    piece of type design, but it isn&#39;t Garamond.'
