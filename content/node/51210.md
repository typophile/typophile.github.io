  ARE COMPLEX AND THE COMPLEXITY IS FURTHER ENHANCED BY THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO
  FIXED STANDARDS FOR DISPLAYING CONJUNCT SHAPES AS WELL AS LIGATURES.\r\nMOREOVER
  THE FORUM WILL ALLOW FONTOGRAPHERS AND CALLIGRAPHERS TO PUT UP LINKS TO THEIR SITES
  FOR STUDYING FONTS WHICH THEY HAVE DESIGNED.\r\nFINALLY UNICODE AND OPEN TYPE FONT
  DESIGN WHICH ARE CLOSELY TIED UP WILL ALSO BE STUDIED"

  body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI am creating a Telugu (an Indic) font. I am using MS VOLT.
    In VOLT Proofing tool the letters are forming well. But when I install the font
    (after shipping it) and test it I am unable to get proper letters. Kindly help
    me. If needed I can send the font with volt tables.\r\n\r\nVenu Gopal[img:sites/default/files/old-images/duvvuri_4117.JPG]"
