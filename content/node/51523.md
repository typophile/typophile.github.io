  would like to share with you my latest font family, Jazm.  The old Arabic Jazm script
  was the remarkable ancestor of modern Arabic script which was probably derived from
  old Arabic Musnad and influenced heavily by the Aramaic Nabataean script widely
  used in North Arabia.\r\n\r\nMy font, Jazm, is a modern typographic vision of the
  Jazm script, not a replication of it, designed along the principles of my Mutamathil
  style.  It has three members, Normal, Bold, and Black.  A fourth member is Jazm
  Quraan, which is a slightly modified version of Jazm Black.  Based on my research
  article about the history of the Arabic script, which will be published very soon,
  I have concluded that Early Kufi or Quranic Kufi is nothing more than a heavily
  bolded version of the Jazm style used in Hijaz, which was specifically utilized
  to distinguish the glorious Quraan passages from normal texts, a practice used by
  all other religious books of the area then.  That includes the so-called Ma\u2019il
  style, which I believe was used much earlier than it is claimed now.  As for the
  use of Kufi to name the old style, this was probably done much later in Baghdad.
  My conclusions are based on examination of hundreds of old manuscripts and stone
  inscriptions. \r\n\r\nNotice how the Jazm script was a true \u201Csimplified\u201D
  Arabic style utilized long centuries before Linotype!  Clear and remarkable horizontality,
  minimal shapes per letter, and as it was the case with Nabataen, connectivity seems
  to be very basic. Shapes are mainly connected as is, with minimum transformation.
  \ On the other hand the heavy Jazm used for Quraan later, included ligatures and
  more alternative shapes.  The rules for Yaa\u2019 alone are so fascinating! Also
  notice changes for Ayn and Qaf. Here is a PDF link:\r\n\r\nhttp://arabetics.com/public/Arabic_Jazm.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n-Saad\r\n\r\nhttp://arabetics.com\r\n"

    Tom\r\n\r\n'Ayn in Jazm, as evidenced by stone inscriptions, was clearly an Aramaic
    Nabataen 'Ayn. Due to very few pre-Islamic inscriptions available, there is no
    sample of how final 'Ayn appeared centuries before Islam, but we have sample of
    middle and initial 'Ayn which were clearly Nabataen like. 'Ayn in Musnad was a
    small circle.   \r\n\r\nUnlike early Quraic Kufi, the so-called Ma'il ( ) style
    used for Quran in Hijaz show final Ayn is also a Nabataen shap.  See final Ayn
    above in the boxed word \u0633\u0631\u064A\u0639 from (Surat al-Nur, Ayah 40).
    Compare to final 'Ayn of typical Early Kufi. This 'Ayn and other analysis of Ma'il
    convinced me that the so-called \"lonely and obscured\" unexplained Hijazi Kufi
    Mai'l style found in modern days belongs actually to the first half century after
    Islam, not 150 years later, as it is told now in textbooks. In a way, Ma'il is
    the missing link between Jazm and Early Kufi, it was probably the first attempt
    to distinguish Jazm for Quraan from typical Jazm, that was abandoned in favor
    of early Kufi.\r\n\r\nIn my modern typographic Jazm, I have selected Ma'il style
    final 'Ayn for my Jazm font and early Kufi final 'Ayn in my Jazm Quran font (see
    initial post image).\r\n\r\n-Saad"

  body: "Hello Claudio\r\n\r\n>>Could you tell me which forms are perceived as more
    classical and, laterally, more authoritative, in the Arabic?\r\n\r\nNaskh and
    Kufi, are the two main historical original classical old Arabic styles. Both are
    modernized and utilized today, but Naskh is by far the most popular. Almost 90%
    of all historical calligarphic styles were derived from Naskh.  However, fourteen
    centuries later, Arabic historians are still debating whether Naskh or Kufi came
    first. Many believe they were originated independently, probably in two different
    geographical locations.  I think Naskh was directly derived from early Kufi, which
    I am refering to here as \"Hijazi\" Jazm, the name pre-Islamic northern Arabs
    used for their Arabic script to distinguish it from \"Musnad\", the Arabic script
    that was widely used in the peninsula, but was later replaced by Jazm after Islam.
    \r\n\r\nSeveral forms of the earliest Jazm and early Kufi scripts are not utilized
    today in the daily script usage.   \r\n\r\n-Saad"

  body: "Saad, many thanks for your detailed and authoritative explanation.\r\n\r\nAfter
    a short research I did a few days ago I understood Naskh (as a typeface) is on
    the same plane as our most classically proportioned Latin seriffed faces (i.e.
    the original Garamond, Jenson etc.),\r\nso I guess Tomas Milo's Naskh 2007 is
    the last word in first class classical typography\u2026 :=)\r\nAnd this is extremely
    interesting. Historically there seem to be no apparent reason for which scripts
    get connected, apart from the need of writing faster.\r\nCapitalis Rustica and
    Uncials originated around the 4th-5th century AD out of the need of having an
    alphabet for common writing tasks. At the same time Latin letters had another
    development as they were used for side-notes to the inscriptions, and very quick
    writing, with pointed pen or stylus on papyrus or wax. But then, after many variations
    and an incredible richness of connected scripts, Latin affirmed itself as an unconnected
    alphabet in print (this may largely be connected to the practical aspect of this,
    as Karsten pointed out in another thread).\r\n\r\nWhat you say about whether Naskh
    or Kufi came first is super-interesting, since our calligraphic forms evolved
    necessarily from inscriptions.\r\nDo you know if this early Kufic style/Hijazi
    Jazm was used in inscriptions and relevant writings, both in pre-islamic Arabia
    and in important applications, literary or religious. Was that mostly an exposed
    writing (like in stone inscriptions) or used on vellum and other support for literary
    puroposes? I see from your reply to Milo there are very few resources about this
    material, do you know where I could find something?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for taking
    your time for replying. I see it's incredibly complex, and I don't know if I'll
    be able to get to the roots of Arabic, but I love the alphabet."

    The need for \"writing faster\" was also the main reason for the invention of
    typography.  As Goudy put it: \u201Cthe demand for more speed than the scribes
    could provide made some means of more rapid production necessary.\u201D \r\n\r\n>>Do
    you know if this early Kufic style/Hijazi Jazm was used in inscriptions and relevant

    All are stone inscriptions. This is why I think we need to examine early Islamic
    inscriptions more closely, in addition to early Islamic historian works rather
    than relying solely on these stone inscriptions (all in Nabataen territories).

    born in the first couple centuries AD, since even Musnad, the Arabic script widely
    used then had two cursive (used on soft wood) and non cursive styles.  Inscriptions
    of Cursive Musnad going back to 300 AD are available.\r\n\r\n-Saad"

    is the reason why Linotype's Simplified Arabic was accepted back in the 50's at
    the time when so many simplification attempts were being made. The key was the
    fact that they were able to use a feature of the Arabic script that was not alien
    to it. The simplicity of the early forms leaves a lot of room for modern interpretation.
    It's very interesting to look into.\r\n\r\nFor reference regarding Naskh and Kufi,
    a good place to look is paleography though of a slightly later date. Early handwritten
    notes on papyrus (early 8th century) were very similar to the manuscripts written
    on parchment.\r\n\r\nA great book to read is:\r\nKhan, Geoffrey\r\nBills, Letters
    and Deeds: Arabic Papyri of the 7th to the 11th centuries\r\nPart of The Nasser
    D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art\r\nOxford; Nour foundation, 1993\r\n\r\nHe
    writes: \"The script current in documents of the 3rd and 4th centuries AH can
    be distinguished by...two traits: One was a formal development in which the shapes
    of the letters became more rounded, even in examples executed with the greatest
    care, it can therefore be classed as a change in script competence. The second,
    which may be seen as marking a general decline in script performance, was the
    increased frequency with which cursive tendencies occurred. These may be identified
    as follows:\r\n1- The transformation of angles into curves.\r\n2- The transformation
    of curves into straight strokes.\r\n3- The elimination of the necessity to remove
    the pen from the surface of the papyrus.\r\n4- The reduction of the distance covered
    by the pen.\r\nAt least one of these factors played a part in the formation of
    cursive letter forms.\u201D\r\n\r\nKhan also provides visual analysis to back
    up his arguments (p.40-42)\r\n\r\nAnd again he writes: \u201CIn general, it can
    be said that the script of the papyrus documents written in the first 2 centuries
    of the Islamic era bear a certain resemblance to the contemporary monumental styles
    found in inscriptions, on coins, and in Quoranic manuscripts, especially those
    in the hijazi script1.\u201D\r\n\r\nAdolf Grohmann, reknown expert on the topic,
    sais,\u201D In the first half of the IInd century of the Higra the script begins
    already to change into more roundish characters... S. de Sacy and after him E.
    Sachua as well as R. Lepsius qualified the script as Naskhi which is, of course,
    not quite right, but might be justified as a sort of auxiliary characterisation
    for this more flexible script.\u201D\r\n\r\nGrohmann, Adolf\r\nFrom the World

    is part of the research I did at Reading into Early Kufi. I hope this helps."
