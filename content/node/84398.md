  skills, so I would really like your opinions about it.\r\n\r\nThese are the links
  to 4 almost complete pages, home page, post page, archive index and category index;
  i use the font League Gothic (in the final online\_version it will be Alternate
  Gothic from URW++ but for desktop use I don't have the license) and Chaparral Pro.
  Any thoughts will be very appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/453750/TTP-home.jpg|Home

    wide.\r\n\r\nNot a fan of Chaparral, but thats a matter of taste.\r\n\r\nNot sure
    about the red / orange combo.\r\n\r\nNice design. :-)"

  body: "Hi Giuliano,\r\n\r\nDon't love the red/fluorescent orange, and I think the
    grey you've chosen is too cool to carry the red and orange.  Try warmer greys
    and tone the orange down with some brown to a ginger.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/orange_for_red_5668.jpg]"

  body: Regarding color I'd use either the red or the orange but not both. Orange
    is a vibrant, energetic color which might not be the best choice for your subject
    matter, but that's your call.

  body: "@giulianovelli: In an effort to help the group provide you with more meaningful
    feedback as compared to subjective aesthetic response, perhaps you can tell us
    a bit about the context: Who is it for? What do they do? Who is the audience?
    What is their goal? Who will be managing it? What are their resources (time, budget
    &c). Good design is about fitness for purpose. To do something <em>by design</em>
    means to make informed decisions based upon an objective understanding of the
    context.\r\n\r\nIn addition, is this personal, professional, or academic?"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nthank you all for the replies and the great advices. \r\n\r\n@timaarts
    \ @cdunitz @JamesM \r\nthanks for the advises on the colors, you are definitely
    right about the orange/red combo and the cold grays, i will try to fix that. About
    the color/content issue, this is a WordPress theme, not a website for an actual
    client so the contents will vary, so I will offer more than a color combo to choose
    from. This one will be the primary one, so thanks for the good advices.\r\n\r\n@Luma
    Vine\r\nthe circular graphic is a stylized rendition of the paint \"The Thinker\"
    by Fran\xE7ois-Auguste-Ren\xE9 Rodin. As I said, this being a theme, the buyers
    will definitively change the logo with their own, so it is intended to be a placeholder.
    I will try to render it better anyway. \r\n\r\n@Cristopher \r\nyou are right,
    here it comes a bit of background: this is not a client website, but a commercial
    WordPress theme. This theme is conceived for single/multi author weblogs (the
    version I have posted here is the multi author one, with author pics and info
    on each article and on the home page, the single author version is very similar
    except for a text box with author name and some additional info about the article
    in place of the pic).  My goal with the design was to mix contemporary and classic
    suggestions to appeal to an audience that produce authoritative and/or in depth
    content but don't want to appear too academic/dry. Being a WordPress theme obviously
    I can't have an idea of which the readership will be. Anyway this theme is intended
    to be a niche one, without the thousands options you often see on commercial themes,
    totally focused on the actual content , so it's not intended to appeal to the
    masses."

    off to the right, as though it's flowing around the graphic.
