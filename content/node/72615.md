body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n\r\nI need some feedback on a logotype for an F&B brand
  that I've been working on. \r\nIt's based on Susa Bold (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/susa/).\r\n\r\nThe
  client likes the original version, although he is concerned that people would read
  the logotype as Loi, instead of Zoi, due to the cursive stroke of the uppercase
  \"Z\".\r\n\r\nTherefore, I've made some modifications to the uppercase \"Z\" to
  make it look less like the cursive uppercase \"L\" (please see image below).\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I really like the curvy upper case \"Z\" because it has so much flair which fits
  the brand perfectly, and gives the logo a unique personality. I'm afraid that the
  more I reduce the cursiveness of the uppercase \"Z\", the less flair is retained.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n1)
  How would you read the original logo? Loi or Zoi? (please see image below)\r\n2)
  Which one of these modifications has the best balance of readability and flair?
  \r\n3) What can I do to make it better?\r\n4) Is there another typeface that has
  a similar quality to Susa Bold that I can use as a base; a solid and refined script,
  less spontaneous and not too feminine?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your input!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/revision_round_1_3691.jpg]"

  body: "Diminishing the swash only exacerbates the \"Loi\" problem, I think.\r\nMy
    solution would be to try reworking the tail into a descending loop like school
    cursive."
