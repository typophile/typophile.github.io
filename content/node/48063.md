  to ask.\r\nMy font provide glyphs only for capitilized letters, numbers and some
  chars as\r\nexclamation mark, minus (ascii 32-96 with more left blank).\r\nWhat
  should I choose for encoding and all that matters that I do not understand?\r\nI
  would like to use different glyph for opened and closed dquote, any suggestion?\r\nI
  am working on fontlab, and I know how to do glyphs, only I need help about all the\r\n\"burocrating\"
  companion that must be used to do a font complete and usable.\r\nAny suggestion
  would be appreciated.\r\nThanks,\r\n                tano\r\n"

    they work for me. I don't consider myself an expert, but nobody else has responded.\r\n\r\nI
    would recommend reading Leslie Cabarga's book, \"Learn Fontlab Fast\". It really

  body: "Thanks for your reply. In fact I was to start thinking\r\nthat my post was
    too ugly to be replied :-)\r\nFrom what I reading seems that the encoding you
    choose\r\nfor working is important only to have all the glyphs you\r\nneed at
    hand, so I think I can choose any encoding that\r\nhave all the capitilized letters
    and double quotes, then\r\nwhen I export the font choose the latin-1 encoding.\r\nThis
    is what I learn in the last days, so it may be wrong.\r\n\r\nAbout the fact that
    I want opened and closed double quote\r\nto be different, some encodings provide
    those and could\r\nbe used on a windows pc with alt+8220 and alt+8221.\r\n\r\nBye,\r\n
