  to Dutch Type Library's Argo. In case it wasn't obvious, I'm after something a bit
  cheaper. I'm well aware that you \"get what you pay for\", but thought I'd check
  to see your opinions.\r\n\r\nThanks for any input.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nTrev\r\n\r\n<a

    The stroke thickness seems to vary more on Argo (in just the right places it seems),
    giving it a really slick feel.  \r\n\r\nI'm sure my terminology is wrong, but
    I still make the observations :)"

    what you mean with \"too similar\"? It started out as a custom project and the
    client wanted a sans serif looking more like FF Dax. So there is where I began
    my studies.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    So for anyone else picking up on this thread: The closest font to Argo I found
    is Praxis Pro with a 98 % Horizontal scaling (or 2% slimmer). Gerhard Unger designed
    Praxis in the late 70's and it's still a really modern font. Used in small sizes,
    Praxis is a cheaper alternative to the very pricey Argo. I've now bought both.

    It may be the case that a 2% distortion is in fact acceptable.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDear
    Chris, although I think this is not what you may have intended writing the quoted
    sentence, I would like to point at the following: Even if their would be legal
    documentation that states something about a minimum deviation, how would one define,
    measure and evaluate this? \u2018Two percent of a typeface\u2019: Of a given font?
    Of the latin letters? \u2018Considerable difference\u2019: How much is considerable?
    Such a document will hardly give us a clue of what may turn out to be acceptable
    when a court has to decide on such a case or what a committee of experts may advise
    or what lawyers may agree on before such a case comes to court. Also we have to
    take into account that the value of legal documentation is more or less related
    to the legal situation in the country for which the documentation applies. Different
    countries, different laws \u2026\r\n\r\nI think that the easiest way for a forum
    like this is to simply keep the obvious pirates out and that \u20182% discussions\u2019
    tend to be contra-productive. Being designers and foundries living in the small
    world of applied arts, I think we should try our best to be fair to each other
    rather that discussing on how to try to stay within thought legal boundaries."

    agree more. I was looking for, for the sake of simplicity. any legal documentation
    regarding any form of horizontal scaling at all, from any country. Good will aside,
    to protect the legal rights, and livelihoods, of type designers, such documentation
    will eventually have to exist. The amount of discussion on this forum regarding
    plagiarism, outline theft &c is a testament to this.\r\n\r\nBefore computers and
    the internet, this may not have as relevant issue, but times, technology, and
    what they empower individuals to do have changed, and will most certainly require
    new methods to address. Trust me, I\u2019m on your side. I wouldn\u2019t be part

  body: "<blockquote>What do you mean by \u201Cthought legal boundaries?\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHaving
    read and heard about cases of plagiarism, I think I may say that the felt difference
    between what the law may seem to state and what experts called in by the court
    may decide to advise can be breathtaking to those who think (thought) of their
    designs to be protected legally (the boundary in this case). In Germany, a typeface
    design is considered to be applied art which means that the work you did as a
    typeface designer cannot be truly new and unique. One can register a design as
    \u2018Geschmacksmuster\u2019 though. This costs money and it is only a registration.
    When someone else has registered a similar design (before you) or even your design
    (!), things may become troublesome. After all, who can tell wether two designs
    are the same, similar or different enough? Experts called in by the court in such
    cases may be experts on antiques, art, design or whatever, but not necessarily
    on typeface design on a level that you might expect or would like them to be.\r\nA
    classical example of how a court may decide on originality is the design of the
    figure 1 in the ARD logotype as can be seen here top left: http://www.ard.de The
    ARD is the largest stately owned broadcasting institution in Germany. After the
    ARD launched its new logo, a German commercial broadcasting station that was new
    to the market decided to have a figure 1 in its name Kabel 1 (Cable 1) and logo
    as well. It did not take long until they were sued by the ARD for plagiarism.
    Although the ARD 1 had been explicitely and exclusively designed for ARD (there
    is no typeface that includes a 1 in this design), the court decided that the (registered)
    design of the figure 1 was not original enough to deserve protection at all. The
    1 has been drawn on an angular grid and although we may consider this to be quite
    unique for a figure 1, the court decided that it was not. I find it astonishing
    that even an institution like the ARD who can spend more money on a legal case
    than all members of Typophile may bring up together, has not been able to win
    this case."
