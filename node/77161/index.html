		<div class="commentbody"><p>A beautiful and informative chart, which will no doubt prove helpful to many people considering the design of a Hebrew typeface.</p>
<p>However, it creates the appetite for more.</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Characters Used for Hebrew Grammar&rdquo;, we see two forms of the Komatz, one longer than the other. But these distinct characters aren&rsquo;t named, nor are Unicode points given for them.</p>
<p>Shvah and Komatz are both shown aligned below the characters - and it appears that the same alignment applies for both of them, making those two charts redundant (except for differences caused by the fact that Shvah is narrower). But the correct alignment of marks that appear above the characters isn&rsquo;t shown.</p>
<p>Oh, and the alignment of Shvah and final Nun is missing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the entire Tanach (Hebrew Bible), a combination of a final nuhn and shva never occurs. A combination of a final nuhn and komatz however does occur. Hence, only the latter appears.</p>
<p>In the entire Tanach (Hebrew Bible), a combination of a final chaf with shvah or komatz occurs many times. Therefore, these combinations appear as a standard item in a vocalized (with nikud and dagesh) font.</p>
<p>In a font, the dagesh version of a final chaf has the shvah or komatz appear either above the baseline, to allow the taam to be positioned below the baseline, or in order for these nikud vowels to stand out, as a nikud rarely occurs in the final form of a Hebrew letter.</p>
<p>A final mem does have chirik appear under it when followed by a non-appearing yud, as in the world, Jerusalem ירושלים. Hence, there is a dedicated glyph for this combination.</p>
<p>In OpenType, only Unicode values appear. The &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; or &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; Hebrew fonts substitute and reposition the required combinations (GSUB and GPOS), so additional Unicode values are not necessary.</p>
<p>Above the alignment rules are visually described, as you noted.</p>
<p>Basically, the nikud vowel is centered under the medium width Hebrew letter. In the case of a Daled or Reish, it is right aligned under the vertical stem of the letter. In the case of the narrow or wide Hebrew letters, the nikud vowels are centered as well, though some modification is done by the type designer, based on the particular design of that Hebrew letter.</p>
<p>The characters for Hebrew grammar are also those for the shvah-na. A Unicode value is not given, because the Unicode Consortium has not assigned one as of yet. I will post the Unicode value for the komatz katan.</p>
<p>The folded lamed (the ascender is folded to be parallel to the ascender height (important for narrower line spacing, and/or not bump into the nikud vowels in the line above.</p>

<p>That is what the Unicode Corsortium stuck in. Thanks for the clarification. Where in Tanach is it used?</p>

<p>In your example from Genesis 43:26, the aleph in the 4th word, &ldquo;va-ya-vee-ooh&rdquo; - &ldquo;&hellip;ooh&rdquo; has to dot not in the center space below on the left side, but in the center space above on the right side.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it&rsquo;s not there at all. What you see is ink splatter or dirt.</p>
<p>David, do you have the van der Hooght Biblia Hebraica of 1849 to compare? Why would they put the dot above.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it is a dagesh at all. Rather, it must be a mappig, because there is greater space for placement in the middle height on the left or right (though we put a dagesh on the left of the letter). So, if it was placed below, it was in order to teach us that it was not a dagesh, but a mappik.</p>
<p>The typesetter at the van der Hooght Biblia Hebraica of 1849 likely made an error.</p>

<p>A Mapik only occurs at the end of a sentence that has a dottend hei. It will never occur in another place in a sentence, nor it will never occur to any other dotted letter.</p>
<p>However, there is an occurance where a Mapik does occur not at the end of a sentence, but never to any other letter.'</p>
<p>So, David, are you saying them the dotted Aleph is not a Mapik?</p>
<p>Where is the Mapik rule written?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help with the answer to that one: the information I have is that a dot in an aleph is not normally used either as a mappiq or a daghesh hazak, but that there are rare occurrences of it being used in each of those ways in the Masoretic text of Scripture. Since these are both exceptional cases that break the rules, a grammar of Hebrew might not give me the needed information.</p>
<p>In the book &ldquo;A Sign and a Witness&rdquo;, I remembered a reference to an unusual letter that appeared somewhere near the end of the fifth chapter of Exodus or the beginning of the sixth that wasn&rsquo;t referred to in the work by Haralambous. I eventually hunted up that information today, and found that there was a reason it was not mentioned there: the &ldquo;phe lefufah&rdquo; is found in some traditions, but is outside the Masoretic mainstream. So I am still only beginning to assimilate some of this information, which is still confusing in places.</p>

<p>True Kaballah is divided into two parts. Torat HaKaballah, Kaballah Study, such as that which is fond in the holy Zohar, and its clarification in Torat HaChassidut (mainly in Chabad-Lubavitch). And Kaballah HaMaasit, Applied Kaballah.</p>

<p>I personally was witness a simple Jewish woman, who retired early, to travel across the USA, to heal people. Her formula was simple: in part of her prayers, called &ldquo;Rafehnu&rdquo; in the Amidah, she thought of the person who needed healing. As a result, the person was healed.</p>
<p>Rafehnu means &ldquo;Heal us (O G-d)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I asked my rabbi how this was possible. He explained that during her life she must have done something remarkable. And in the merit of that good act, G-d granted special powers.</p>
<p>I return to the woman, and prodded for that something special she did. She told me that it must have been when she was a small child. Her grandfather lived with her family when he was very old, as was the beautiful custom years ago. Every Shabbos he want to walk to an Orthodox shul, which was many many miles away. Each Shabbos she walked with her grandfather, while her parents and siblings drove in the family car. Even when it was winter, her grandfather and her tredged through the freezing snow.</p>
<p>That must have been the special good and kind act.</p>

<p>Ah. Wikipedia tells me there are 217 Samaritans in Israel, living in Kiryat Luza and in Holon - and a few others in the United States. It also notes that there are about 12,000 Karaites in Israel, and about 4,000 in the United States.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My understanding is that while the Sadducees didn&rsquo;t believe in an afterlife, the way the New Testament referred to the Pharisees and Sadducees together implied that they were both respected portions of the Jewish community, even if they were in disagreement. But the Samaritans, on the other hand, were despised, hence Jesus' parable of the &ldquo;Good Samaritan&rdquo;, to illustrate that righteousness towards one&rsquo;s fellow man comes before correct theology.</p>
<p>The Sadducees may have, like Karaites, rejected the Oral Law, or simply placed less emphasis on it; but they were definitely not Samaritans.</p>
<p>As to the Karaites, yes, they are very similar in some ways to Christians - and, thus, they have been the targets, even more than ordinary Jews, of efforts to convert them to conventional Christianity, or to become &ldquo;Messianic&rdquo;. But as long as they not only do not accept Jesus as the Messiah, but also do not accept the New Testament as scripture, there would still be plenty of room for differences between them and Christians.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for your explanation. This is a tangent on a tangent, and a discussion of theology as well. But to best understand Hebrew letter forms, it&rsquo;s best to have a full picture of the people and their Judaism. To best understand what something is, at first we must understand what it is not.</p>
<p>Still, I do not understand what are the factors that make Samaritans despised.</p>
<p>With all due respect to my Christian friends, I think that analogy of the &ldquo;Good Samaritan&rdquo; is misleading, like the answer about what goes out of a mouth can justify what wrong things go in the mouth. Like the gay rights activists argue about great gay people in the arts.</p>
<p>A good thing doesn&rsquo;t justify a wrong thing. They are two separate issues.</p>
<p>Sure, be kind to others, speak fine words, be creative even inspiring, but don&rsquo;t do the wrong things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s misleading to suggest that a good act automatically justifies anything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there were good Nazi fathers at home with their wives and kids. But on the Jew street, they yanked out beards, threw babies in the air and shot them with their guns, or raped wives in front of their husbands.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>A good thing doesn&rsquo;t justify a wrong thing. That certainly is true.</p>
<p>People of every faith, though, generally speaking, belong to that faith, and not another one because it is the faith they grew up with, the one in which they were instructed with in childhood from their parents. Thus, people who belong to a different faith from one&rsquo;s own are not there because they have committed, any more than the members of one&rsquo;s own faith, the sin of not searching for the true message of G-d to humanity.</p>
<p>The people of all the faiths may think that their own faith is the One True Faith, but the world does not know which is which. The world does, however, know the difference between someone who is righteous and kind, and someone who is wicked and cruel.</p>
<p>But what is that supposed to mean, as a message from Jesus to people who are believing Christians? Thanks guys for coming to the right church on Sunday, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter? No, because that&rsquo;s a message that could hardly be at the heart of a religious denomination that would continue to exist.</p>
<p>A bit of humility about whether the faith of one&rsquo;s fathers is really the True Faith is, however, not inappropriate. But that isn&rsquo;t really the message here.</p>
<p>Instead, it is generally believed - although different denominations handle this one differently, and some would not accept this - by Christians to be this:</p>
<p>Do not count yourself as righteous because you are privileged to be in the True Faith and others are not.</p>
<p>The W-rd is spoken to Man in order that he might be righteous and do what is pleasing in G-d&rsquo;s eyes. If those who have not heard the W-rd still do what is righteous to their fellow man, is it not even more pleasing?</p>
<p>Those who have heard the W-rd are also called to worship. But the worship, the prayers, the sacrifices, and the burnt offerings of those who oppress their neighbor are not pleasing unto the L-RD.</p>
<p>Of course, this seems to be saying that good works towards one&rsquo;s fellow man are what Christianity is about, and religious belief is secondary - an addition rather than a fundamental obligation. The reality of Christianity as a whole is more complicated than that. This is the message of one parable, that of the Good Samaritan.</p>
<p>But elsewhere, the New Testament also points out that &ldquo;by grace, not works&rdquo; people are saved - the necessary thing is to believe in Christ, so that He can forgive your sins. But it also says &ldquo;faith without works is dead&rdquo;. Christianity basically reconciles these contradictory messages like this:</p>
<p>Christ died on the Cross in order that it may be possible to forgive sin (or, at least, to forgive sin without sacrificing animals at the Temple).</p>
<p>To have your sins forgiven, it is helpful (but perhaps not strictly necessary, as far as what is explicitly stated) to accept Christ as Savior.</p>
<p>If you really have done this, though, then you will be righteous and you will do acts of kindness to your neighbor. (Or, at least you will <em>want</em> to; G-d looks upon the heart while the world sees only actions and their results. Doing the right thing is important, but what counts is doing or trying to do the right thing for the right reasons.)</p>
<p>And those who truly follow Christ are also called to the worship of G-d.</p>
<p>So in Christianity there is a strict ordering of prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>faith in G-d and Christ;</li>
<li>works of justice, mercy, and charity;</li>
<li>acts of worship.</li>
</ul>
<p>The earlier items are required to give the later ones meaning, and the later ones are necessary consequences if the earlier ones are really present. So, while there is an ordering, there is also some circularity.</p>

<p>I was taught when I first entered a yeshiva rabbinic college at age 23 1/2 that the way to know whether something is true or false, be it a teaching, a behavior of a student, is to judge by the results.</p>
<p>If the teachings produce generations after generations of refined people, then those teachings must be true.</p>
<p>But if the teachings of brotherly love and kindness etc. produce the opposite, hatred and murder etc., then those teachings must be false.</p>

<p>There is a great lesson from the Midrash (a section of the Talmud dedicated to teachings based upon verses of the Tanakh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moses spotted the burning bush, and looked away.&rdquo; - Exodus 3:2-6 &ldquo;What did he look at?&rdquo; asks the Midrash. He foresaw all the generations of the Jewish people until the advent of the long awaited Moshiach. He spied the very last generation; they perceived nothing of G-d, like Mose who spoke face-to-Face with G-d; they did not have the great learning of the entire Torah, like Moses had.</p>
<p>Moses reasoned, &ldquo;If they had the good fortune to see G-d as I do, to learn the entire Torah as I do, they would be so much greater than me. This humbled Moses exceedingly, and Moses was the humblest on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>We say in the Talmud that our sages obm debated the entire night about what was greater: deeds or learning.</p>
<p>They concluded that &lsquo;maaseh hu haikar&quot; - deeds are the main thing, but learning is great too, for learning leads to doing deeds (correctly).</p>

<p>In Judaism, this notion is rejected. Self-achievement is essential. The disadvantage of the above approach is that it allows a person to get off &lsquo;scot-free&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A similar lesson is taught in the Talmud, in tractate Taanit/Fasting, and very likely studied by Yeshu/Jesus when he went to Rabbi Joshua&rsquo;s yeshiva.</p>
<p>A discussion arises regarding the fear of G-d (brought about by faith), and deeds. The Talmud concludes that fear of G-d is false, if it is not joined by deeds.</p>

<p>So?</p>
<p>What is the relationship between positioning/mark positioning &amp; &lsquo;Masoretic annotations added later&rsquo;? or if the ta&rsquo;am is a little bit to the left (&ldquo;system one&rdquo;), or to the right (&ldquo;system two&rdquo;), or centered?</p>

<p>I am surprized you ask. Aren&rsquo;t you omnipotent? :)</p>
<p>I think there is no extra significance to either system. Perhaps, the second system is even false, because some nikud vowels have one role, others have another; different taam are for one purpose, and others are for another; often a meteg-like symbol is called a meteg and serves one purpose, and others are called a silug and serve another purpose all together.</p>
<p>So we have six categories at the very least. Why is one higher in importance than another? Who will rate them?</p>
<p>This nikud is more important that this taam, but not that one. Silugs? Oh, so dear! A silug is greater than a shvah-nah. Bump it up! Etnachta? Well, an etnachta is greater than &hellip;</p>
<p>If I were G-d, I&rsquo;d dump the second system in the ocean, and let it drown.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As I understood what Rabbi Seldowitz wrote, &ldquo;system two&rdquo; had the vowel points centered beneath the Hebrew letters, and the accent marks placed to their right. While that could result from a conscious decision to give priority to the vowel points, obviously it could also be the result of a manuscript being written in ink on papyrus (as opposed to pencil, or ink on parchment that could be given the palimpsest treatment) at one time with vowel points, and then with the Masoretic accents being added by another scribe - independently, on a later occasion, without the scribe placing the vowel points having been aware that someone else would add accents perhaps a hundred years later.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I have so much trouble expressing myself clearly.</p>
