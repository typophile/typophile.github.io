body: "\r\nhi all,\r\n\r\ni am interested in embossing type on a book jacket for a
  *very* small (short-run) personal project. i am only interested in blind embossing,
  not foil embossing.\r\n\r\ni have a feeling it would be quite expensive to have
  a printer do this. are there cost effective alternatives to a traditional printer's
  embossing process? is it possible to do it myself?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance for
  any suggestions you may have.\r\n\r\njarrod\r\n"

  body: "Blind embossing is the cheapest embossing one can buy. Sometimes printers
    forget that they are not using any ink for it -- and try to charge the same price
    as if they were. (This was what I learned from a first hand experience in stationery
    and engraving back in 1971) -- so my only suggestion is when negotiating your
    price - remind them - no drying overnight - no ink to be used, etc. etc. What
    will cost is the die they must cut to emboss. But the last blind emboss we did
    -- they actually used a paper plate for a short run - and it was very inexpensive.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."

    Note there is a difference between embossing (two plates and register) and debossing
    (one plate).\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "You might, if you have a very short run and time to spend, try a method I
    have used for creating visuals to show clients (not that I invented it, a colleague
    who is a paper engineer showed it to me). Cut the characters out of a thick (2mm)
    sheet of plastic card and mount it to another heavier sheet (or plywood) sticking
    laser prints on both, before cutting, can help to make sure everything is precisely
    as you want it, lightly wet (wetting helps stretch and separate the paper fibres)
    an untrimmed sheet of the stock and securely tape it to the mounting board, and
    use a burnishing tool to gently work the stock around the relief, leave it to
    dry on the board, roughly trim it and make up your book and do a final trim. It
    is very time-consuming and it is worth trying different stocks, as some will be
    better than others (a more fibrous, uncoated paper works best) and doesn't create
    as good a finish as a proper emboss.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: I was thinking along the same lines as Tim, and also wondering how expensive
    it would be for you to have a polymer letterpress plate made. Probably cheaper
    than a standard die, and since you have so few to do, it should hold up all right.
    If there are only a few characters, hand-cutting would make sense, but if the
    type is smallish, and lots of characters, then polymer might be the way to go.
    I'm sure you'll remember this, but if you order a plate just be sure to specify
    which way letters read depending on whether you intend to emboss or deboss.

  body: "\r\nwow, thanks for all of your responses. i'll start looking into all of
    your suggestions.\r\n\r\ni had a couple specific further questions:\r\n*Jackie,
    when you say they used a \"paper plate,\" do you mean instead of a metal die?\r\n*Bruce,
    is a \"polymer letterpress plate\" a standard animal, so to speak? Are you suggesting
    this would be a more inexpensive method to use working with a printer, or as a
    way to make my own die/plate and use Tim's process?\r\n*finally - i found embossing
    powder last night. insofar as i don't actually want to print the type, i'm not
    sure this is a viable alternative, but was curious if anyone had any experience
    with it nonetheless.\r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\njarrod\r\n"

    been doing lots of linocuts and tried it for embossing as well.\r\nThe material
    is very easy to cut, so it can be done pretty fast and accurate.\r\nEven using
    a spoon to rub the paper can create some nice result, so you won' t have to invest
    in a press...\r\nBest to use some quality art paper;\r\nIf you do have a press,
    put some cloth on the paper - as with etching.\r\n\r\nPeter "

  body: "Jarrod, talk to anybody local that does letterpress and they'll be able to
    tell you of a local source. Basically you give them a PDF or a Postscript file
    and they give you back the beast in relief on a sheet of etched polymer. A local
    might even have a spoiled plate with type of approximately the same size as yours
    so you could try an experiment before investing in a whole new plate. These plates
    do not have a terribly deep profile so it may not suit your needs, hence trials
    always helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where Findlay is in relation to you, but if
    you don't have a local friend who does letterpress, there is a monthly letterpress
    enthusiasts newspaper, <em>The Printer,</em> right there in Ohio. Their address
    is 337 Wilson Street, Findlay, OH 45840; their phone is 419-422-4958; their email,
