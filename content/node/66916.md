  of any sort, so I was hoping to get your help. I would like to get the following
  verse in a tattoo on my right calf, and was hoping I could get your opinions on
  fonts, spacing, kerning and all that good stuff.\r\n\r\n\"Though I walk through
  the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your
  rod and your staff, they comfort me.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the verse I was planning on,
  and I was hoping to run it just under half way around my calf and then rap to the
  next line, so I'm guessing it would have to be about 16pt, hoping for no longer
  than 3 lines long... I don't know if this would be adequate information.. That would
  make the width about 3.5 to 4 inches across..\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't know if this
  info makes sense... Think any of you could help me out?"

  body: "Typography aside, I'd worry that at that small size, the ink will bleed over
    time and you'll be left with an illegible blur. I've only got limited tattoo experience,
    though, so talk to your artist about it. \r\nDon't bother with serifs at that
    size. I'm not sure how much detail you'll be able to get. Maybe Futura would work,
    though I'm not sure that jives with the verse you've picked. I'll let others add
    further to the discussion."

  body: Seems an awfully long text for body art but then I'm not really a fan of the
    medium anyway.

  body: More serious thought ... why not just use a part of the quote "Fear no Evil".
    That sounds like a tattoo, yet still will have the religious meaning. (To really
    mess with people, put "Psalms 23" as a source.)

  body: "The most important thing is to find a tattooist who knows what they're doing,
    and if possible one who is specialized in letters/text.\r\nThe second most important
    thing is not to make it too small. Blurring is definitely a factor, as is stretching,
    depending on location/exposure etc.\r\n\r\nHrant, the spiral idea is very good!
    I've been thinking about getting something like that.\r\n\r\nBTW, some nice (and
    some less nice) text based tattoos here: \r\nhttp://www.contrariwise.org/"
