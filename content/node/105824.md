  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is too late or even if it's any help,
    but here ya go!\r\n\r\nMy initial idea was also Helvetica Ultra Compressed but
    there is something slightly different with that. This appears to be more square
    shouldered on the lower case o and a - more like Compacta bold. Although it still
    had that sweeping, almost reversed S shape on the 'a' which is a Helvetica thing.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    after a 10 minute play around in Illustrator, I came up with this (see pic)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LogoRework_5616.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    if it is of any use - you can download a pdf of the vector outline work from:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nifakp15vhdwdhm/LogoRework.pdf\r\nUse
    it or lose it!\r\nI couldn't u/l a pdf here on Typophile for some reason."
