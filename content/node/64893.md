body: "New licensing schemes have been launched for Andron. The idea behind is to
  stretch costs over time in order to keep the entrance price rather low. \r\n\r\nA
  special instalment plan is offered for students, who now can get started with Andron
  at incredible \u20AC45. \r\n\r\nAnother special license is adressed at publishers
  who edit scientific journals, and their authors.\r\n\r\nSince this kind of licensing
  is bound to handle a standing order payment it may be less interesting for those
  who don\u2019t have a German bank account for the time being (banks tend to extra
  charge you for cross-border payment orders). Consequently the offerings [[http://www.signographie.de/contenido/index.php?contenido=3b73786a570fca618bd224903f3141e9|are
  presented here]] in German by now. But I\u2019m prepared to give any further explanation
  in English if required."
