  in FontBook. \r\nAll 6 headings have passed validation; FOND Font Association Table,
  etc, until the final one: System Validation \u2013 serious problems were found.
  Do not use this font.\r\n\r\nHow can I tell what is wrong with the font? and how
  can I put it right?\r\n\r\n'preciate any help. Thanks."

  body: "><em>have you tried running it through MS font validator?</em>\r\n\r\nI don't
    think that'll be possible. MS font validator only runs in Windows. Nick is generating
    a Type1 for Mac, which means the font will have a resource fork. And when such
    a file is brought into the non-Mac world, it'll have a 0k size.\r\nBTW, does MSFV
    even read Type1 fonts (the PC ones, .pfb extension) ?"
