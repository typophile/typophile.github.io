body: "is probably this arrangement of the preliminary pages of 'Boek' by H. Van Krimpen
  (1966, Van Loghum Slaterus, Arnhem), loaned to me by my friendly local bookseller
  (thanks Brian!) So I thought I'd share it with you lot. Does anyone know where the
  quote comes from? It sounds like something of Beatrice Warde's...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/boek_a_5110.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/boek_b_6528.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/boek_c_3993.jpg]"

    had been 'bought in' from another source.
