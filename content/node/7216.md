body: here i have an assignment called combination of materials where i have <BR>to
  make a product using the unusual or usual properties of the materials. <BR>Ex:-usual
  wood rigid and hard, unusual flexible when made very thin. <BR>So i am expected
  to do some magic like the things that we find in science <BR>museum. So we have
  a set of words we are supposed to selct any two of them <BR>and make a product or
  some thing that would represent both of them. <BR>can anyone please if possible
  think of some idea which can be <BR>done &#40;any material. Here are the words u
  can think for <BR>Balance, flexibility, movement, transperancy, reflection, rigid,
  fly, <BR>float, fragile, knot, sound, opposing, porous, elasticity, spring, light.
  <BR>that may not be known to many people and that it very fascinating i mean <BR>that
  would be a surprise. <BR>It can be scientific also. Any experiment that u can recall.
  <BR>i have run out of ideas so am posting it. <BR>ps:- I also have 6 gmail invitations
  for someone who could post a good idea. post your email id along with ur idea

  body: I assume s/he is asking for your email so they can send you the gmail invite.
    <BR> <BR>Sounds like a class assignment from a design esoteric art professor.

  body: Your summary of your brief is one of the most confusing I have ever read.  That
    sort of stress ain&#39;t even worth a gMail invitation.
