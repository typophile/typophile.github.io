  distorts it so that, for example, some of the corners are rounded instead of sharp
  and the baseline is uneven instead of straight.... \r\n\r\nWould this constitute
  copyright infringement or do you think it would be safe to do?  The idea is to draw
  up the existing font manually, and then employ a fontographer programmer to turn
  the distortion into an active/working font.  They will not be using any software
  from the source font."

    to do with the software.

  body: "Copyright infringement \u2014in any field\u2014 is a <em>dynamic</em> question
    that may vary upon the matter.\r\nWithin some scopes as musical compositions or
    literary works, it is quite defined since early intellectual property laws were
    written.\r\nNevertheless, copyright extends <strong>only to expressions</strong>,
    not to ideas, procedures, methods or concepts; which is to say: copyright protects
    only the appearance or, more widely, the 'art'.\r\nIn the other hand, it safeguards
    a work from its reproduction in any form, such as printing or recording, from
    its public performance, broadcasting, and even translation into other languages
    or encodings, or its adaptation into different media.\r\nIt is not against the
    law to make copies for self usage (i.e.: backups) or testing purposes, if they
    remain within the personal and private scope of the legitimate user for the copyrighted
    work, let's say, the owner of a musical album; even more: it is permissible to
    use limited portions of a work (typically, 'quotes'), mostly by clearly mentioning
    the source.\r\nI guess that if you copy by hand and then modify an existing design,
    there are only two thing to state:<ol><li>How much your work looks like or resembles
    the original protected one</li><li>What are you going to do with it</li></ol>\r\nThe
    first question is controversial, so as, when you decide to publish and/or protect
    your work (and here you are answering the latter), there is a period in which
    anyone is allowed to contest it by arguing his/her own right on the IP of its
    expression, and a legal arbitrator will decide who's right and who's not.\r\nThere
    is an optional previous instance which is to contact the owner of the copyrighted
    work to require his/her opinion about your work, and eventually the permission
    to publish your work under an explicit agreement (that doesn't need to be public).\r\nAnyway,
    before all that stuff, be sure the work you are intended to replicate and distort
    is actually protected (a friend of mine designed quirky a sans-serif version of
    Garamond based on an old metal cut printing and he did not infringe any law).\r\nIn
    my opinion, you'd must be first aware you conscience is clear.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

    allow for this kind of modification to be sold as a derivative work. Those foundries
    that allow modification are generally only allow format change and even then that
    modified font counts as one of the seats licensed. It is only allowed to be used
    in-house. \r\n\r\nAnd I agree with the others that it isn't ethical. \r\n\r\nWhich
