body: "I\u2019m stumped. The font identifier on fonts.com is stumped. Help!\r\n\r\nSample
  A:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample3_6094.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample2_6244.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
  first thought was Trajan Pro or LaGioconda, but neither of those fit. Trajan Pro
  is very close, but the lower right serif on the capital A does not extend at all
  to the right in the sample. The font in the sample also appears to be squarer in
  its proportions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSample B:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample1_4412.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  hope I'm not missing something obvious on this one. I thought maybe in the Garamond
  family, but nope. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
