  for a diving school and is aimed at beginner scuba divers. The project is a very
  small web project for which the client needed an identity too. Budget is tiny (mainly
  for web part), so have no room for multiple iterations and variants.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aquaman-diving-logo_3725.jpg]"

  body: 'I''m not sure you need the bubbles AND the wave. But if you keep both, perhaps
    the bubbles could be placed elsewhere. The Q seems to be getting too much focus. '

  body: It did cross my mind Darrel. I kinda see some similarity with the 'Q' and
    an old divers' helmet though

    advice about the wave being redundant (and it reminds me more of toothpaste than
    of diving ;-)"

    a gridded circle to make it more of a literal diving helmet:\r\n\r\nhttp://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/P915955.jpg"

  body: "I got the helmet thing, which made me feel like it was a bit more serious
    diving, rather than casual/leisure diving, but the name seems playful enough to
    go the other way.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is my taste, but I often like to see the subtitle
    in a complimentary font, in this case simpler sans a bit smaller, but still echoing
    the overall structure of the main font.  \r\n\r\nAs for the bubbles, they feel
    too geometric or something.  Have you tried to make the bubbles form the counter
    of the Q?  or even just try them as solid circles instead of outlined?  Not sure,
    but you are close to something very nice considering the time and budget.  Good
    stuff!"

  body: "I like it, but it needs tweaking.  I didn't see it as a helmet at first,
    I just saw waves and bubbles as 2 separate graphic elements, which seemed a little
    redundant. The bubbles should stay, but maybe if you made the rest of the Q look
    more like a helmet, instead of a Q with a wave, it would work better.\r\n"

    with the window of the helmet.\r\n\r\nGr Jeroen"
