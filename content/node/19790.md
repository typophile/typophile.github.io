  else is way off. I have an idea, that I've seen the font before, but nothing pops
  up in my mind.\r\n\r\nSee it here: http://www.papermag.com/modules/archive/uploaded_images/1307_ct_kal_penn.jpg\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nhttp://www.papermag.com/images/comingsoon.gif\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding
  Base-9 (and base-12) I must say I really like the font, when all letters are capitalized,
  but I don't quite like it, when it's lower case. I feel the the upper-cases coould
  be put together with something else. Something similar but without the pointy/sharp
  ends. Any ideas on how an alternative lowercase base-nine could look (and what the
  name of that font would be)?\r\n\r\nThanks"
