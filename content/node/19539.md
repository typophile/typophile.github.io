  body: it looks quite a bit like Font Bureau's <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Eagle/styles">Eagle</a>
    but quite many details don't match so that's not it.

    joint' (M, N, W, A, etc.) faces that I can find on all the sites and still haven't
    found something that matches completely. I guess it can't hurt to try to shoot
    someone there an email and ask.\r\n\r\nBut if anyone else has some educated guesses,
    I welcome them.\r\n"

    have been redrawn for Vanity Fair (they are both Conde Nast, no?)\r\n\r\nWhoops,
    realize Stephen already suggested Vogue.\r\n"

  body: "hello friends!\r\nlong time reader first time poster. \r\nright now i'm having
    a hard time detecting the name of TWO fonts that can be seen in the new york magazine,
    so i didn't wanted to start a new thread. there's nothing in google that mentions
    the fonts especifically.\r\n \r\nwww.nymag.com , \r\none is the font contained
    in the logo, in italics \r\nthe other is in the tabs  (news & features, restaurants,
    etc.)\r\n\r\nany help would be much appreciated, and i'm happy to be here at the
    boards, finally.\r\n\r\n-carlos"
