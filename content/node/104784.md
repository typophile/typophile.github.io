body: "Hello, I found this vintage poster online, and I really like the font at the
  bottom of the poster. I tried a couple different methods to try and see if there
  was a font for it, but didn't find anything. I figured maybe someone has seen the
  font before or maybe something similar?\r\n\r\nThe link to the actual poster is
  below. I am also attaching a rough tracing of the font as a jpeg in case that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.enjoyart.com/library/travel_tourism/japanvintagetravelposters/large/Japan.jpg]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FontTest-02_4026.jpg]"

  body: "\"Vintage\" is not very specific as to how old the poster is. But the style
    of the poster suggests that the lettering is part of the artwork.\r\nIf you want
    a font that is close to the lettering I recommend  <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/pluto-sans/\">Pluto
    Sans</a>. You will have to add the outlining effect.\r\nDon "
