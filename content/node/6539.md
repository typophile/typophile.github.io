body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;I really could use some help
  -- I&#39;m having problems with a font I bought earlier today, and I&#39;ve run
  out of ideas. <BR> <BR>The font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/wade-vernacular/">Wade
  Vernacular</a>. It comes as a set of  four versions &#40;solid, shadowed, shaded,
  outline&#41;. I bought it as Windows TT, even though what I really needed it for
  was a project I&#39;m doing on my Mac &#40;the fabled zine&#41;, because Win TT
  is supposed to work under OSX, and I haven&#39;t had any problems doing that in
  the past, and I wanted to be able to use it on my Windows computer &#40;e.g. it
  has a better printer&#41;. <BR> <BR>Three of the four versions are working just
  fine &#40;solid, shadowed, shaded&#41;. The fourth, Wade V. Outline, is doing some
  really bizarre stuff in my Adobe programs. It works fine in everything except InDesign,
  Illustrator, and Photoshop. This is what it looks like: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48254.gif"
  alt="Outline big"> <BR>This is what is should look like: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48255.gif"
  alt="Outline textedit"> <BR>For comparison, the other versions, which look fine:
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48256.gif" alt="Solidshaded">
  <BR> <BR>Even more bizarre than the first image shows, the distortions change as
  you change the point size. For example: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48257.gif"
  alt="Hs"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried resinstalling, converting the problem font from
  Win TT to Mac TT with a Mac program &#40;TTConverter&#41;, with a PC program &#40;CrossFont&#41;,
  and rebooting, with no luck. And this version &#40;outline&#41; was most of the
  reason I bought this font instead of some other slab serif. <BR> <BR>Anyone seen
  anything like this before?&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: Could be a hinting problem. Could be something else--including a bug in our
    apps. I&#39;ve written the developer asking if he&#39;d be willing to give us
    a copy of the font for testing purposes. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    idea... I feel silly that I just did not think of that. I just now emailed myfonts,
    though they&#39;re probably out till Tuesday. If they don&#39;t have a solution,
    I&#39;ll email Aboutype.'

  body: Thanks Thomas. Although I don&#39;t have all that many programs on this computer,
    so I couldn&#39;t really do an exhaustive Adobe/non-Adobe test. I have MS Office
    but haven&#39;t installed it yet -- I&#39;ll try to install it tonight and see
    if the same problem happens in Word.

  body: Wow, so MyFonts just offered to switch me to a Mac PS version. I think I just
    assumed, really for no reason, that they&#39;d be meanies and say &#34;That&#39;s
    what you get for buying the wrong format.&#34; <BR> <BR>Thomas, I tried it in
    Word &#40;v. X&#41; and it&#39;s doing the same thing there. So if it&#39;s a
    bug, it probably isn&#39;t an Adobe-specific one. And I also just discovered that
    the distortion doesn&#39;t show up in PDFs exported from Indy. Go figure. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for the suggestion Stephen, sorry if I seemed a little panic-stricken
    everyone <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: The designer was kind enough to send me a copy of the font, and I couldn&#39;t
    find anything wrong with it &#40;other than the exclamation mark being in the
    slot for the space character, but that&#39;s another issue&#41;. Path winding
    order looks good. There are a few unnecessary control points, but nothing terrifying.
    <BR> <BR>My best guess is that FontLab&#39;s TT auto-hinting is messing things
    up a bit. I would hardly even blame it; an outline this complex is &#42;really&#42;
    poorly suited to TT auto-hinting. But who&#39;d want to manually hint something
    like this, either? If I needed a TT version, I&#39;d be tempted to leave it completely
    unhinted. But that&#39;s just me. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    still keep the old buggy version as well - autogrunge for the 21st century, dude.

  body: Huh. Well, I regenerated the font two different ways from FontLab 4.6.0 &#40;Win&#41;.
    Once with hinting, and once with hinting suppressed. NEITHER version shows the
    problem. The developer says the TT was originally generated from FontLab in the
    first place, so color me confused. <BR> <BR>Seeing as it&#39;s not a problem specific
    to our rendering, it&#39;s easily fixable, and how it got messed up is not obvious,
    I&#39;m giving up on this one for now. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T
