  body: "The ampersand is completely different than Sansa, though.\r\n\r\nAt this
    size, the slanted \"e\" could be a result of hinting, if the font was a TTF-based
    font hinted for display.\r\n\r\nOr it could be a pixel font, as mentioned previously.
    any other samples?\r\n\r\nJason C"

    exact match. I'll just keep searching. Thanks for all the suggestions so far.
