  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Few months ago I moved from Italy to Bosnia-Herzegovina and, since I could carry with myself only few design books and a Bible, I ended up reading Bringhurst and the Four Gospels from dawn till dusk.
Now I'm going to spend Christmas holidays in Italy so I can take some other book from my library and buy new ones. My suitcase isn't huge and I won't be back in Italy again before next summer so I must select carefully.
What would you choose?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Without a doubt, Underworld by Don Delillo, I feel a strange kind of regret everytime I go to a bookshop and see it on the shelf because I've read it and own it and have no need to buy it.

Dostovesky's Crime and Punishment, possibly the greatest novel ever written, the writing is so good and immersive the divide between Raskolnikov's life and mine began to blur a little as i read it. I've heard the Borthers Karamoazov is as good if not better.

Continuing the Biblical theme Pilgrim's progress by John Bunyan,  Screwtape letters by CS Lewis for two very different, entertaining, helpful and wise takes on what it is to live as a Christian.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Read <em>House of Leaves</em> by Mark Danielewski. It's a great example of stories-within-stories, American gothic horror, hardcore erotica, erudite writing, and it's got great typography set by the author, with words that go forward, backward, into shapes, etc. Literary critics describe it with respectful comparisons to Nabokov and Borges; Poynor included it in <em>Graphic Design and Postmodernism</em>. And getting funny looks when you have to keep rotating a book when you're on a plane is always great.

If you want to read something tremendously fun, contemporary and erudite without delving into the design world, read <em>World War Z</em> by Max Brooks. On the surface it looks like a kitschy zombie book, but it's just as engrossing as Harry Potter, and far more intelligent.</div>

you got through USA but not through Underworld! Kudos i guess, I really liked Manhattan Transfer but I imagine I would probably need to organise some leave, or actually get stuck on a desert island to navigate USA. Haven't read Mao II but can't wait, loved Libra the 'ficitional' biography of Lee Harvey Oswald.

Additionally I'd recommend New York Trilogy and pretty much anything else by Paul Auster, off-kilter self-reflexive clue-puzzle whodunnits (sounds cerebral, is fun).</div>

Nicholas, Patricia:
I heard about Delillo but still didn't read anything by him, is him comparable to Thomas Pynchon? I was enticed by <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em> but couldn't read it cover to cover although I tried more than once (I got lost somewhere).
Dostoevsky and Melville will be in the list 100%.

Alessandro:
Thanks for good luck wishes, actually it's going better than what I expected.

Kris:
LOL! Herzegovian wine is pretty fine too. I complain just about the coffee.

Patricia:
Amazon doesn't sell Italian books and unfortunately I don't speak English well enough to read novels smoothly. At a local bookstore I found <em>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</em> by Rebecca West (a must read about ex-Yugoslavia) but I stop at every sentence to counsult the dictionary.
Anyway I'll use Amazon for design books.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Manilo,

Yeah you could compare Delillo to pynchon, perhaps in intent more in style; I think both are interested to capture and comment on American consumer culture/hyper-capitalism in all its manifestations, (especially Underworld and White noise) Delillo is much less scatty/absurd then pynchon, much more formal and dramatic, I've only read Vineland so that's what I'm going off. I own gravity's rainbow and have managed a total of about 6 pages; I know Patty would disagree, but I found Delillo much more accessible to read than Pynchon.

I reckon the trick with Dellilo is to accept early on that the characters don't speak quite like people speak but, though you seem to lose a level of identification (and ability to suspend your disbelief), you gain so much insight into reality and relationships and people through the actual content of the dialogue that it doesn't matter. White noise is fun and a lot less intimidating in size than Underworld, I'd read that first and see if you dig what's going on,
cheers, have fun in BH

Also - on a more populist note, Memoirs of a Geisha is a pretty compulsive read. Bet it's translated into Italian.

Nick: I totally agree re Delillo and Pynchon. I love Delillo, and have read a lot of his books. I just found Underworld bloated and un-engrossing. THe first  50 pages were great tho. All I've read of Pynchon were Crying of Lot 49 which is fun but kinda dated now, and Vineland which I liked but didn't love.

100 Years of Solitude is another winner.

The Brothers K rocks.

Middlemarch by George Eliot, War & Peace, anything by Edith Wharton, Infinite Jest a few more weighty tomes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">House of Leaves, Mark Z. Danielewski. A good length read, thoughtful messages, and can be quite a conversation piece. Simultaneously gimmicky and substantial, ireverent and relavent; it is well worth rereading and dissection, making any copy a bargain. It's even panders to the typophile in you.

I don't recommend many products. This is something exceptional.

		<div class="commentbody">I thoroughly enjoyed Auster's Book of Illusions. Also, a different and ribald book, Tom Robbins' Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates.
Margaret Elphinstone's Hy Brasil was an engrossing read, as was The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver. Mmmm, and Blindness by Jose Saramago.

For poetry, I'd get some kind of modern or postmodern anthology. And an anthology of short stories can be a wonderful thing, too.

About Perfume, I have heard both rave and negative reviews. So I haven't read it yet, but probably will eventually.

I usually read the book and then refuse to watch the movie!

One of the most disappointing movies from books (a book I would also add to my desert island list), and which I must admit I haven't seen, is Narnia. Not only did my daughter's English teacher read the abridged version to the class, she dragged them to see the movie. E's experience of the real Chronicles (when we get to them) will forever be marred by images of the movie.

Absolutely. I even bought myself the pop-up book. A masterpiece by Robert Sabuda published by Simon & Schuster in the UK, quite expensive and you need to keep the kids at distance, which is sad because they go mad when they see it.

I loved <cite>A Confederacy of Dunces</cite> (Pulitzer Prize) by J.K. Toole. Set in New Orleans, it has been translated but I'm afraid it only makes sense in English. Awesome.

When I left England I took with me 3 books by Jonathan Coe: <cite>The Rotters Club</cite>, <cite>The Closed Circle</cite> (follow up) and <cite>What a Carve Up!</cite> (The title in the US changed to <cite>The Winshaw Family</cite> I think) and a few Private Eye editions to remember my wonderful years in the UK! 

How could I forget: John Lanchester's <cite>The Debt to Pleasure</cite>. What a book: Eccentric, refined and voluptuous. And Manlio, the Italian translation is fine too (the title in Italian is <cite>Gola</cite>). 

Italian: anything by Calvino, Sciascia or Primo Levi, but I don't need to tell you that!

<cite>Perfume</cite> I read it when it first came out (or a couple of years later) and everyone was talking about it. For some reason I wasn't that impressed but maybe I should have another go.

When I was working on the poster for a campaign against Tessa Jowell's Gambling Bill a couple of years ago, <cite>The Gambler</cite> by Dostoyevsky  was a great source of inspiration. His descriptions are so graphic it's amazing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have not read "Perfume" since the 1980s but it has stayed with me as few other books have. A powerful and sensual tale.

Another literary high point for me -- not sure if it was popular enough to be translated into Italian -- is a book called "Le Mas Théotime" by Henri Bosco. It's a wonderful mystery about rural life in Provence in the late 19th century. It was published only once in English, in the late 1940s, but perhaps with luck it was also published in Italian. In France it seems to be perennially in print.

		<div class="commentbody">Now that's funny. I've literally just finished <cite>Saturday</cite>. 15 minutes ago! Loved it, even the long and detailed descriptions of surgeries and squash games. Strange because I remember I wasn't very impressed by <cite>Atonement</cite> when I first read it but now maybe I should have another go. How do you find the Italian translation of <cite>Saturday</cite> Manlio? I read it in Brazilian Portuguese.

I like Patrick McGrath too. Not sure if his is your cup of tea, it's very intriguing though, a bit E.A.Poe-ish maybe. Stay away fom <cite>Martha</cite> though, it's a very heavy book to carry around (I know the feeling, for years I had to choose my books by their size and weight because I was always moving around). </div>

I still didn't begin to read it, so I can't tell you anything.
A friend of mine is literally mad about <em>Atonement</em>. He even reads pages from that book to every woman he's dating.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just finished Three Day Road by Joseph Boyden. Fantastic, but certainly not an upbeat novel. Two native american boys who go off to fight in WWI. I was stunned (and still have mixed feelings about this) to realize after I finished it that the author is young and Scottish/Irish--Basically as far from native american as you can get.
A good, thought-provoking book nonetheless.

		<div class="commentbody">I just zipped through Mark Z. Danielewski's <a href=www.onlyrevolutions.com>Only Revolutions</a>, as I am a big fan of his first novel, House of Leaves.  It's amazing. I can't recommend it to the 'classical' reader, but anyone who liked House of Leaves and is also a great fan of Kerouac will appreciate this road novel. It's also ingenuously designed, it has two front covers, and the pages are laid out so that there are always two stories on one page, but either one rotated 180 degrees. Well, you should just check it out in a local bookstore. It's wonderful.</div>

I don't know about you guys but I find this little "book club" of ours both nice and useful. We should keep it going even if Manlio doesn't have any space left in his luggage anymore!  : )
Plus he might want to go to back to Italy for Easter holidays...
