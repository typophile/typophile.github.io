  for interior typefaces. It is a fiction novel focused on teenagers playing baseball
  that has a strong medieval undertone. \r\n\r\nI've got a couple in mind and pulled
  others from internet searches but was curious what insights the Typophile community
  might have. For chapter headers I'm looking towards something with a nice set of
  alternate glyphs -- Adobe Caslon Pro being a good starting point -- so something
  that might complement that type of character set well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?"

    very well done reinterpretation of Caslon. It is also the Featured Face right
    now. [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/characters/|Williams
    Caslon]]. For headers you could use [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BigCaslon/|Big
    Caslon]] then or Sumner Stone [[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/arepooverview.html|Arepo]].
    \r\n\r\nAnyhow depends on how far the medievalness of your book is, have a look
    at Andron font, which is a fantastic font for everything where you need historical
    characters/signs/glyphs. [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=69&changelang=2|Andron]].
    Or the free font focused on medieval, but it only has a roman face, no italics,
    no bold: [[http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html|Cardo]].\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's sort of a fantasy book based around kids being referred to as \"knights\"
    of Arthurian lore... Arthur, Galahad, Lancelot, etc. The round table is mentioned.
    Not quite armor-wearing baseball players. \r\n\r\nI quite like that Andron set.
    Williams Caslon is nice, too. "
