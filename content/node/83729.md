body: "I have this job for which I thought [[http://typographica.org/2008/typeface-reviews/gloriola/|Gloriola]]
  was perfect. I needed something which was forward looking \u2013 futuristic in a
  present kind of way, if that makes sense \u2013 but down to earth; elegant, not
  too youthful but not too classical; a bit of an optimistic young adult in typeface
  form (again, if that makes any sense). It needed to have a \u201Ctechno-logical\u201D
  edge to it, but still not fall too far away from the humanist tree. And of course,
  it had to have small caps.\r\nAnyway, I thought it was perfect in all the right
  ways.\r\n\r\nBut then I discover it's not available for licensing until 2013. =(\r\n\r\nSo
  I start looking for an alternative. There's [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/dstype/leitura_sans_complete/|Leitura]],
  which is great and cheap (and from a fellow portuguese), but I find it's not perfectly
  designed (the width of the stroke seems irregular, at least in the small caps, which
  is my main concern, here); [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026&path=head|Whitney]],
  which I can't get as single weight files; [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/process_type_foundry/seravek_medium/|Seravek]],
  which is a bit too cute and frankly expensive; [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/just_another_foundry/facit_ot/|Facit]],
  which also has the right price but just doesn't cut it for various reasons; [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_sans_alt|Fedra
  Sans Alt]], which is too expensive and has too high of an x-height; and I also considered
  [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process_type_foundry/klavika_ot/|Klavika]],
  which lacks warmth, and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/underware/auto_complete_family_ot/|Auto]],
  which has too much of a personality for the job.\r\n\r\nSo that should give you
  a quite clear idea of what I'm looking for; any suggestions?"

  body: "Thank you all, nice suggestions all around.\r\n\r\nI didn't consider Relato
    because I thought it was too humanistic. I love it, but it didn't fit as well.\r\nAgilita
    and Flex also have more or less the same problem; they are too detailed, too humanistic.\r\n\r\nPrimetype
    has some interesting stuff towards what I was looking for; but it all seems to
    be a bit over the budget for this, too (unless I could negociate a different package
    with them). And Zatro doesn't have small caps.\r\n\r\nI'll have to study this.
    :P\r\n\r\nAnyone else? Further suggestions will be thoroughly appreciated."

  body: "It's a shame Foundrytypes doesn't have a better showcase for their typefaces;
    I really can't see that much. I've been a fan of those Architypes for quite some
    time, now.\r\n\r\nI had considered Tabac and Alright Sans, but they still have
    this same problem: not enough of that \u201Ctechnological\u201D touch of cold
    precision (which in Gloriola came possibly from the almost monolinear design and
    lack of perfectly rounded shapes). Quay is also too detailed (tapering of ends
    of strokes, etc.).\r\n\r\nParka and Agile look closer to what I was looking for.\r\n\r\nI
    have to further analise all these. At some point I'll have to give up on finding
    Gloriola going by some other name\u2026 :P\r\n\r\nThank you all for all your very
    helpful suggestions. :)"

  body: "Thanks, theterrible! [That sounds funny]\r\n\r\nYeah, I saw all of those
    too: at least at the time I rejected all of them for some reason and/or other
    (too pricey comparing with my cheapest alternatives, no small caps, not really
    what I was looking for, etc.). I really love most of these and most of what I
    considered, but I guess love is not enough! :P\r\n\r\nI've been playing since
    yesterday with the idea of forgetting this and just designing the most needed
    characters myself. The job didn't really ask for a typeface; I just thought it
    would be a nice touch. And the client isn't spending-inclined, either, so maybe
    that's that.\r\n\r\nWhat I designed came out pretty well, so this alternative
    is now becoming the most likely candidate\u2026"
