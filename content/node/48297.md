  body: What does this represent? What brand I mean? It is very gothic. I like it,
    but wonder what it represents.

  body: "it is not exactly a brand name (EPIXS) in fact it is more personal label
    than anything else - with this logo I will sign all my designs to certify they
    are my work...\r\n\r\nRatbaggy was right - it comes from negative of E/3 trimmed
    from a 45\xB0 rotated square:-)\r\n\r\nMiguel Sousa - you are right - it reminds
    of that logo, but i think I can live with that:-)))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.behance.net/epixs\r\nepixs@yahoo.com\r\n+359887323000"

  body: "Looks terrific!\r\n\r\nMy first association was \"France\", but I'm not entirely
    sure why that is. I think I've seen it in French crests etc. before. Seems to
    be like a national icon or something? And Carrefour is a French company after
    all. Funny coincidence...\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign Hamburg]]"
