body: "Here's something really annoying. Suppose you have some small caps and you
  want to make a rough pass at spacing them more generously. \r\n\r\nFontlab, like
  Fontographer, has a provision for increasing spacing of selected or all glyphs by
  x units or x percent.\r\n\r\nYou will obviously choose percent - - if you're me
  - - \r\n\r\nProblem is, Fontlab, unlike Fontographer if my memory is correct, doesn't
  understand 0 or negative sidebearing values, so simply does nothing to these glyphs.
  Astonishing.\r\n\r\nOK. Just checked with Fog. Fog understands that decreasing Left
  SB of -10 by 30% results in a value of -7. But Fog doesn't do anything with 0. And
  a sidebearing of 1, decreased by 50%, results in a useless value of 0.5\r\n\r\nSo
  maybe Fontlab is right to ignore these values?\r\n\r\nBut that leaves a question:
  what <em>does</em> constitute my request: 'increase the spacing of A-Z by 30%' ?
  And how do I achieve it? Obviously the machines don't understand what 'percentage'
  means in this context, but then, neither do I, so I can't complain. But I would
  like to get there, just the same. Any ideas? "

    of 40 and 40, and you have V with sidebearings of 0 and 0. Increasing the value
    of 40 by 25% would give you 50. So how do we determine the percentage of increase
    for V? Do we have to consider V in relation to H? Should the 'percentage' be derived
    from H, with the left sidebearing being considered 100%? In which case where is
    0%? Suppose we obtain our value by subtracting the SB with a 0 or negative value
    from the value of H? Would that work? \r\n\r\nWhat happens when layout programs
    do tracking? For example, suppose you had the string HHVHVVH. How would Quark
    and InDesign apply positive tracking to this string? \r\n\r\nI'm ashamed to admit
    that after all these years in font design I have no answers to these very basic
    questions! "

  body: "It's been a while since I messed around with this, and I seem to recall that
    FontLab was confused by negative values: it would adjust the value itself, which
    would make the spacing wider if you were trying to make it tighter and vice versa.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing I would advise is to use the measurement line option when performing these
    kinds of operations, because then you can increase or decrease the sidebearings
    relative to stems and bowls, rather than to the extremes of the glyph. First position
    the measurement line at an appropriate height (typically a little more than halfway
    up the x-height for a Latin typeface) and then adjust metrics using the Action
    Set dialogue, checking the 'Use the measurement line option'. Note that some letters
    such as <em>a</em> and </em>c</em> will need either manual adjustment or a separate
    pass with the adjust metrics tool, since the measurement line won't intersect
    the outline in a useful place."

    Nor will it work for O shapes, all of which vary according to where the line is.
    Or L. In fact it will only predictably work for H, I, etc. as far as I can see.\r\n\r\n>Adjusting
    left and right sidebearings by 30% or -30% works fine on positive and negative
    sidebearings for me.\r\n\r\nJames, you're right about the negative values, I see,
    but only for <em>some</em> negative values. For example, try adjusting A sidebearings
    of 3,3 by 30%. Fontlab does nothing! (Fog would probably give you something close
    to a 1-unit change, which is not helpful.) That means when you select A-Z, and
    tell Fontlab (or another program) to add 30% to the amount of sidebearings, H
    will change a lot, and A not at all. If you use the measuring line for A, the
    value will change all over the map, depending on where the measuring line happens
    to hit the diagonal. So that doesn't work for me at all. All it means is that
    for larger values, there is a very large shift in units, whereas for small values,
    there is a disproportionately tiny shift in values. Whatever happens, you are
    <em>not</em> getting a proportional increase or decrease of spacing in the range
    of glyphs e.g. A-Z. \r\n\r\nThis leaves the question: what constitutes a percentage
    of metrics in terms that are useful to a typeface designer? \r\n\r\nAgain: I can't
    think of anything better, conceptually, than using the value of H in some sort
    of equation. But there must be something better!\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it is
    clear that doing percentage changes is almost valueless. I would have been better
    off just adding 10 units to everything.\r\n\r\nAH: I think I have it. Kind of.
    When we say we want A-Z with thirty percent more spacing, do we mean that we want
    the total width to be 30% greater? Even if we did (and I now begin to doubt this),
    we would still be faced with the problem of getting the glyph back into the proper
    proportional placement within the glyph. There are many glyphs that we don't want
    'centred'. "

  body: "Another illustration of the problem. Suppose F has sidebearings of 45,11.
    We apply a 30% change and get 58,14. So left side has changed by 13 units while
    right side has changed by only 3 units. Obviously something is wrong here, because
    these values are of no interest to a type designer. \r\n\r\nDid I mention that
    this font is an old one of mine where I made the huge conceptual mistake of using
    Berthold-style kerning? Multiply that by four masters and you can see what kind
    of trouble I'm in. \r\n\r\nWhen I was designing the font, I looked at many of
    the metrics files for the Adobe Berthold fonts. There wasn't a single one that
    didn't have at least one obvious kerning mistake -- and that was after they had
    fixed the pretty dodgy data that came from Berthold. Instead of accepting the
    reality that Berthold kerning is just too much trouble for anyone, I said to myself,
    well, I will just be more careful than Adobe and I won't make any mistakes. Hmph.
    I could not have been more wrong. \r\n\r\nTo add to the fun, 5.04/Vista just crashed
    when I attempted to export metrics - - I wanted to see what would happen when
    you export metrics from an MM - - oh yeah, you just get a binary .mmm file. Would
    be nice to have a wonderful MM-style AFM format. I wonder if anyone at Adobe ever
    worked on this? Or is there any way to convert a .mmm file into readable/editable
    ASCII?"

  body: "I have been running into the exact same problem lately with my small caps
    spacing. I wasn't happy with the results of increasing by fixed units, so I thought
    percentages would be the better route. But as you point out, this method doesn't
    really help.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm curious is how InDesign tracks vs. adding or
    subtracting spacing the glyph data in Fontlab. It seems like if you track-in a
    set of caps 30 units in InDesign the result looks different than if you reduced
    your sidebearings in Fontlab 15 units on each side. I'd be curious to do a visual
    test of this and compare the lengths of lines done either way.\r\n\r\nI think
    when it comes to tracking new sidebearings you just have to do it manually. There
    is just a traditional look to how things should space wide vs tight that I don't
    think corresponds to any particular relation to sidebearing data, measurement
    line wise or otherwise. Without getting into ridiculous kerning schemes, there
    is a limit to negative metrics value you can have to glyphs like V and R. So these
    limits affect how tight you can make other letters. This is particularly true
    with all caps. The sidebearings of capital letters just don't relate in a linear
    way between loose and wide spacing schemes. Or so it seems to me.\r\n\r\nI have
    never worked with MM metrics and kerning... the thought frightens me!"

  body: "I think increasing or decreasing sidebearings by percentage is inherently
    problematic. I wouldn't do it.\r\n\r\nThe way I think about spacing is this: The
    sidebearing is the sum of two fixed values: a constant amount of space between
    characters plus a positive or negative adjustment for optical alignment, which
    depends on the profile of each character. One of these is global, while the other
    varies from character to character. Both of these are fixed values, but they are
    not stored separately in a font, rather, they are stored as an aggregate value
    in the sidebearings. Changing the sidebearings by a percentage destroys the independent
    nature of these two values since it acts on both at the same time. You really
    want to only change the global inter-character space constant, not the optical
    adjustment of individual characters. Increasing or decreasing by a fixed amount
    (globally), in effect, does this."

    pretty well; it is only shapes with deep distances such as C and L that are likely
    to be thrown massively out of whack.\r\n\r\nAlso note that when I say 'pretty

    is being calculated for sidebearings. But unless you actually set these values
    numerically in a table somewhere, does this really help in making the calculations?
    I'm imagining that one would calculate the optical value relative to the minimum
    global spacing you can get away with? I'll have to try that and see how it works
    out.
