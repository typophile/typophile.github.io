		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting article, and it raises a question in my mind: are typographers less likely to create free type than software developers are to create free software because typographers get less in return?</p>
<p>Free software developers often create software because they have an interest in what said software will do. There are myriad reasons for producing a piece of software that one will actually use, thus a free software developer is also a direct beneficiary of the software, Don Knuth and Tex being a perfect example. But with type, I feel that the designs are produced almost entirely for the benefit of others; I don&rsquo;t get the impression that many type designers create a face and then use it on a regular basis—there are of course exceptions, such as Professor Spiekermann—and thus the primary benefit of designing type—excluding personal satisfaction—is receiving financial compensation from those others who put the type to use. So when a type designer releases a face for free, unlike a free software developer he is not then rewarded with software that solves a particular problem of his own, instead his gets back to work and waits for the royalties to roll in.</p>
<p>Am I making any sense?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">James, I agree with you completely.  I have a strong interest in free (in the FLOSS sense) fonts, and I am currently working on a screen font and fonts for TeX. My work is motivated by various needs that I have perceived, and occurs in spurts as I notice in the fonts as I use them various things that need fixing.  For instance, in my math fonts the partial differentiation operator doesn&rsquo;t get much love, since I&rsquo;m not an analyst. :)</div>

<p>free software ethic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My problem with this phrase is the use of the term &lsquo;ethic&rsquo;, as if there is inherent moral superiority in producing software free to the public. In general those producing software are being paid for their labor. If they are faculty, they are paid by Universities for their research time, out of which software may be one result. If they are students, where exploration is part of their education, their parents and state subsidies of education are paying for their time.</p>
<p>Doing a certain amount of true &lsquo;pro bono&rsquo; work is wonderful and praiseworthy. But I don&rsquo;t think it can ever be the source of most production, as most work time needs to be compensated for the worker to continue long term.</p>
<p>If the payment method is such that a good product is free to the public, great. If not&ndash;and &lsquo;not&rsquo; is the general rule&ndash;fine also. Money paid to the developers and disseminators of useful products is not &lsquo;dirty&rsquo;. And those who produce free products generally do not deserve halos, because their work is monitarily compensated in other ways, just not by the users of the product.</p>
<p>Raph is rightly proud of his patents, and here on Typophile I urged him to patent his new drawing software. Patents are monopolies created for the purpose of seeing that innovators are compensated monitarily for their innovations. They are also not &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; because they are monetary; they are intended to encourage innovation, and do.</p>

<p>I tend to agree, and it also places the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; on the shoulders of type designers. I would counter with&hellip;</p>
<p>Most font designers, “have a real suspicion of the ethics of those who might profit from their OSS font contributions&hellip;</p>
<p>Reading the comments on forums like slashdot regarding fonts reveal that the perceived value of type and the work of type designers is very low.

<p>That&rsquo;s my big problem with the free software movement as well. That&rsquo;s what happens when a movement is lead by a guy who has spent his entire adult life in academia and has little clue about life outside of Cambridge. I understand, and to some degree agree with his ideas about the limits on freedom that could potentially be imposed by the ubiquitousness of closed-source-software, but the way that the GNU ideology often turns into self-righteous indignation, or worse, vehement anti-capitalism, among his followers disgusts me.</p>
<p><cite>Reading the comments on forums like slashdot regarding fonts reveal that the perceived value of type and the work of type designers is very low.</cite></p>
<p>The Slashdot crowd in inherently warped because they&rsquo;re so wrapped up in their own success at charging for IT services that they can&rsquo;t see how it doesn&rsquo;t work for everyone. But for what it&rsquo;s worth, sysadmins tend to have low opinions of everyone else; I was a horrid bastard of an SA for five years and now I&rsquo;m a horrid bastard of a design student.</p>
<p><cite>So to me mutual respect and understanding is probably the first obstacle to overcome. Maybe Raph’s Web site idea may be the first step towards that goal.</cite></p>
<p>Maybe, but I&rsquo;m not hopeful. I think that a system which paid bounties of some sort for good free fonts, or made a business case for the foundries to do so, would probably do much better than continuing to push designers to give fonts away for the good of humanity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, very few universities have professors of typography, so we don&rsquo;t see the same number of free top quality typefaces.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, there are enough amateurs churning out a typeface in a couple of hours to compensate. And the fact that most of these are typographically deficient means that real type buyers will continue to buy their type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Don: Though the free software movement started in academia, I doubt that today the bulk of most free software contributions come from academics.  A large amount comes from employees of Red Hat, Sun, MySQL, etc, but I think that most contributions come from people who work on it in their spare time.</p>
<p>jpad: The FLOSS zealots can often be a bit rabid, which is a detriment to their cause.  I think the FLOSS movement is fundamentally anti-capitalist, in that it doesn&rsquo;t seek to profit from everything that has value, but contributes to a &ldquo;common good.&rdquo;  However, such socialist ideas can peacefully coexist with free-market capitalism: think about common infrastructure such as roads and water systems.  This is the area that FLOSS has had the greatest success: infrastructure projects such as operating systems, web servers, etc.  The number of free game <em>engines</em> is large; the amount of free game <em>content</em> is not.</p>
<p>I see two (inter-related) reasons why the font community has not been more involved with the FLOSS community.  Remember that my perspective is based mainly on being a user of FLOSS software and a minor contributor, and secondarily on being an amateur font designer.</p>
<p>First, I think that many FLOSS contributors have a greater sense of directly benefiting from the contributions of others, and that their contribution is then a continuation or extension of the existing free software.  Even when creating a new application, existing libraries, programming languages, code snippets, etc, are used.  However, my sense is that creating a new font is much more done &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; as a complete, separate project.</p>
<p>The other reason I see is that the common approach to font creation is much more &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; than current software development.  Software is often developed in teams, with separate pieces that interact only through strictly specified interfaces.  However, my impression is that fonts are still most commonly developed by a lone designer.  In the FLOSS community, it&rsquo;s encouraged that software is experimented with, tweaked, improved, and then <em>released with those changes</em>.  My impression of the font community (at least from reading Typophile anyway) is that most designers would be horrified at changing someone else&rsquo;s font in ways that the original designer did not intend.  For instance, why not &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the funky &ldquo;c&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo; in Rotis?</p>
<p>Regarding the monetary aspect, I think that the FLOSS community recognizes that quality free fonts are lacking.  Presumably this implies an understanding of what a quality font is, and the fact that they are not present implies that the creation of such fonts is difficult.  Unfortunately, the &ldquo;whiny Slashdot crowd&rdquo; and other factions of the FLOSS community have a sense of entitlement, and feel that then others (ie, font developers) should donate some quality fonts.  (I wonder if this sense of entitlement is a generational thing: part of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; generation?)  I don&rsquo;t feel that way.  Font designers can do as they wish.  I will feel grateful if they contribute something to the font, but I won&rsquo;t criticize them if they don&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s very similar to Typophile: I&rsquo;m grateful for the comments and advice that people give, but if someone doesn&rsquo;t have the time or inclination, that&rsquo;s also fine.  I feel that if there is lack of quality free fonts, I should do something about it myself: for instance, donate to the TeX development fund, or learn about font development and try to create some fonts myself.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I also think that the demand for free fonts results from insufficient recognition of ingenuity and time that goes into type design.
On the other hand, the criticism of the open source, or copy left movement (etc) is too dismissive, and it does not take into account dangerous trends in the intellectual property world, where powerful interests are gradually chipping away the public domain and fair use doctrines. In Canada, for example, publishers and copyright holders are pushing for ever-growing restrictions on the academic use of literature.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that interview has provoked some more good discussion on the topic. I don&rsquo;t think it did a perfect job getting my viewpoints across, but I still think it conveyed a useful perspective to the typical linux.com reader. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that most free software people underappreciate the art of font design, and that most font designers are skeptical that much good will come of a &ldquo;free font movement.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s also fair to say there&rsquo;s real interest in the latter, just in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>There is a free software &ldquo;ethic.&rdquo; You might not agree with it, but there are certainly are a lot of people who believe that free software is morally superior to the proprietary kind. I do both, so I clearly don&rsquo;t see proprietary software as unethical, but at the same time I can see the advantages of free software.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s less clear to me is that the benefits of free software will translate in any significant way to font design. When all you have is a hammer, all the world looks like a thumb, after all.</p>
<p>I agree with sii&rsquo;s <em>Most font designers, “have a real suspicion of the ethics of those who might profit from their OSS font contributions&hellip;</em> If only there were some way to release fonts under a free speech but paid beer arrangement. From what I understand, early drafts of the Open Font License tried to make that happen, but ultimately those attempts are not really compatible with the principles of the free software community. Commercial Linux distros have been trying to make similar things happen on the software side for some time, with only limited success.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to have the answers, but I do think it&rsquo;s worth having the discussion.</p>

<p>I do think that we need to see an even bigger breakdown in IP law, where average consumers get completely screwed and really, really angry about it, before most people start thinking harder about this stuff. But when big nasty problems hit home, people take notice. Nobody paid much attention to foreign oil warnings until things went bad in Iraq and Putin started withholding natural gas, maybe nobody will think about IP freedoms until armed federal marshals are rounding  up DRM-free computers and home stereos.</p>
<p><cite>What’s less clear to me is that the benefits of free software will translate in any significant way to font design.</cite></p>
<p>Someone should get Larry Lessig to start thinking about this stuff. Unlike a lot of the F/OSS movement advocates, non-nerds actually listen to, and often understand, Lessig&rsquo;s arguments.</p>
<p>I also think that someone needs to start defining business cases for free fonts and design, cases that make sense to companies like Adobe and Google which are likely to be receptive. As I&rsquo;ve already stated elsewhere I dislike Ellen Lupton&rsquo;s <em>Free Font Manifesto</em> in part because it leans toward the “for the good of humanity” approach instead of just framing it in a way that makes good business sense. Eric S, Raymond opened a lot of doors for Linux in the business world by pointing out that one can make a lot of money supporting OSS; if ideas like that can convince Larry Ellison, someone must be able to convince John Warnock.</p>
<p>On the Google front, maybe F/OSS types should push Google to add design work to the summer of code projects. It could generate icons, clip art, and type, redesign interfaces, and create promotional pieces for F/OSS. And it would give me a great excuse to spend next summer in Palo Alto.</p>

<p>sense of directly benefiting from the contributions of others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephen, that&rsquo;s very interesting. Now I understand better what JPad and you were saying&ndash;and what Raph is referring to.</p>
<p>I can see from your analysis that there are special conditions where a certain sharing of work-product does make sense, and requires an ethic of cooperation in order to benefit all. This kind of thing actually happens in the font world in a number of ways&ndash;however, not with the actual design of fonts.</p>
<p>People create tools for themselves, such as python scripts, and then share these with others. They do, I think, expect an ethic of cooperation where other professionals doing this will also share some of their work. This contributes to a pool of tools that all can use. Recently even Adobe released their auto-hinting program, which they had thought gave them competitive advantage. Now their corporate strategy has changed, and they are more keen on others outside their company producing good open type fonts, which will enhance the desirability of their Creative Suite products.</p>
<p>Here the &lsquo;free&rsquo; aspect is in a very special situation where the donor  1. Has another main source of income. 2. Reasonably expects to get a return in kind from others, as a tool for his or her work. 3. Builds his or her reputation for expertise&ndash;which often has a monetary pay-off. 4. There is also probably not a significant market for these products anyway.</p>
<p>For these special situations I would withdraw my earlier criticism, and say that indeed there is a free software ethic, and it is a good thing.</p>
<p>But taking it as a model where similar conditions do not apply, and claiming it is more moral I still think is quite wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fundamentally anti-capitalist, in that it doesn’t seek to profit from everything that has value, but contributes to a “common good.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view is very muddled, I think. If you&rsquo;re going to advocate socialism you need to advocate a government who is paying everyone&rsquo;s salaries. If you advocate people giving away their labor with neither a government nor a private company to pay them, then with certain unusual situations noted, you are advocating exploitation. It is ironic that in the early 20th century people struggled and sometimes died so that unions could be established and workers could have power to get decent pay. Now some are getting on their high horses advocating that in effect it is more moral that workers not get paid.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the legions of young people who argue passionately for &lsquo;free&rsquo; music, and then complain that the music &lsquo;sucks&rsquo;&ndash;not noticing any connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a sense of entitlement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that some of this is at work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m entitled to pirated music, software, etc., and the other guy will just have to figure out how to look after himself.&rdquo; The law and ethics don&rsquo;t really enter into such thinking, and the idea that such advocates of piracy are champions of &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; is just hooey.</p>
<p>To return to font creation itself, I think that Jpad was on target in noting that the font creator in general is not looking to get free fonts from others that will enhance their own work. And there is a market for their product.</p>
<p>So the &lsquo;free software&rsquo; conditions do not apply. I note that even those with full time academic positions, such as Mark Jamra, do not give away their fonts. Mark&rsquo;s excellent web site, <a href="http://www.typeculture.org">www.typeculture.org</a>, does &lsquo;give away&rsquo; all kinds of intellectual capital, so to speak.  But his foundry charges for fonts. Similarly Adam Twardoch has put on his site free tools he has developed, but is paid for his labors on fonts.</p>
<p>If those contributing to the development of open source operating systems want better fonts, it seems to me to make more sense for them  to pool money (instead of time) and pay up front to some of the best professional type designers to produce fonts that could be used afterward freely.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am not advocating that workers should not get paid.  I was merely pointing out that, from a purely capitalistic view point, nothing of value should ever be given away for free.  In the FLOSS community, what is given away for free is the right to use, modify, and redistribute.  The product (software or whatever) itself is not necessarily given away for free.  In fact, such licenses that forbid payment for the product have been declared not &ldquo;free&rdquo; by the Free Software Foundation.  The Open Source movement (different from the Free Software movement) has sought a middle path of payment for creation of software (usually funded by service contracts), while still releasing the software as free.</p>
<p>Information products (such as software and fonts) are interesting in that, once created, their duplication cost is negligible.  Thus, the amount of value in the use is not proportional to the cost of creation.  I think this fact is often used to undervalue such services as font creation.  However, I think it does cause a re-evaluation of the standard arguments for and against socialism.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with this.  One of the benefits of FLOSS is education, and I think it is better for more members of the FLOSS community to learn about font design.  It also mirrors the attitude of &ldquo;leave this to the professionals&rdquo; that was prevalent about open source and software in its earlier days.  Since that time, open source software has proven itself to be quality software. (Well, at least some of it.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m going to posit a second idea; another reason that the F/OSS has a hard time attracting type designers is that most F/OSS design software is, to put it mildly, crap. The best piece of F/OSS design software is the GIMP, using it is like using a tweaked version of Photoshop 5 with no CMYK support. Inkscape has vector graphics covered, and seems promising, but I&rsquo;ve not tried it because when I tried running it on my Mac all it did was crash. There is no user-friendly page layout software on F/OSS platforms. Blender is like Maya, 3DSmax, the Quake 3 engine all mashed into one insane app. FontForge sounds promising, but like a lot of F/OSS software, runs under X Windows which I got sick of three years ago, and I&rsquo;ll buy Fontlab before I mess with X again.</p>
<p>On the subject of X Windows, this seems to be a big problem for F/OSS design software on the Mac, because designers don&rsquo;t go out and buy Macs so we can install X, install Gnome and KDE and whatever other libraries takes to run app XYZ that aren&rsquo;t included in the package. It&rsquo;s not bad enough that the software even begin to keep up with Adobe in terms of quality, but assuming that designers have nothing better to do than tinker with X and the associated GUIs is somewhat insulting. Honestly I wouldn&rsquo;t mind this part so much if the software was coming from the BSD crowd, but if the sanctimonious free software nerds are insisting that we have a moral obligation to run free software, they need to provide better software.</p>
<p>I think that right now, the best thing the F/OSS community can do to get designers involved is to get the vendors to partner with Adobe to port the Creative Suite to Linux. It&rsquo;s already clear that the F/OSS community is either not capable or not interested in producing good design software, so bringing the existing standard over is a must. Adobe should be pretty receptive to this; it&rsquo;s no secret that Adobe is not happy with Apple encroaching onto its multimedia turf, but Adobe&rsquo;s attempt to favor Microsoft bombed and appears to be in the process of being quietly swept under a rug. Combined with a desktop environment that doesn&rsquo;t suck—admittedly a tall order for a software community that has turned Gnome and KDE into stagnant pools of bloatware—there might be some chance for the F/OSS world to bring in designers.</p>
<p>Eric S. Raymond has posted <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html">a great piece</a> about why Linux must win the desktop war by or in 2008. He discusses why Microsoft is weak and ready to be toppled—the company can&rsquo;t manage to make a 64-bit OS—and why Linux has been one or two years away from winning the desktop market for the last decade— “Right now, few in the Linux world are seriously trying.” It&rsquo;s a must-read for anyone interested in F/OSS.</p>
