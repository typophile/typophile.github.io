body: Can anyone help identify this handwriting font? <BR>I googled at length and
  examined hundreds of handwriting fonts but the closest I could get to it was Tiza
  or Freely, but neither have the energy or individuality of this one? Any takers?

  body: And here&#39;s an image of the full alphabet. <BR>Someone on another forum
    recognized the above  sample and actualy had a copy of the full alphabet. However
    they could not put a name to the font. &#40;In the alphabet image it seems to
    be called just &#39;Handwriting&#39;,which is not too useful.&#41; <BR> <BR><img

    you google it, that&#39;s no help. It&#39;s credited '
