    most people be able to tell, even if you didn't pick the exact font? Sometimes
    there is little point in being so precise. Or is there something special about
    this N as you see it?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "OK, I looked for an N with a slight curve to the legs and I think this may
    be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-californian/|Californian]] (a.k.a.
    Berkeley Old Style). Goudy was famous for having odd details in his typefaces,
    partly because he cut his own masters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
