body: "Hey guys,\r\nI'm currently doing a project which is to redesign a rather old
  book (re-arranging the layout, and providing various illustrations into the pages).
  The theme of the book is about French wine, and the visual concept took its inspirations
  from the richness and the earthiness the rustic winemaking villages across France.
  The book is novel-like with continuous text, will use manuscript grip system, and
  the pages are about 14.7 X 23.8 cm in size.\r\n\r\nAfter examining dozens of Garalde
  serifs that I'm going to use for body text, I narrowed down my selections into two
  major candidates. Janson Text and Linotype Granjon:\r\n\r\nhttp://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm224/shinnggo/Compare.jpg\r\n\r\nMy
  concerns are:\r\n\r\n1. I think Janson Text looks more rustic but looks pretty similar
  with the typeface used in the original book, which is  [[http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm224/shinnggo/Bodytext.jpg|American
  Garamond]]\r\n\r\n2. I think Granjon looks lovely, but I'm worried it's gonna be
  too refined and bit anemic.\r\n\r\nIn you opinion, which one looks better?\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    to the contrary?\r\n\r\nI would go for Janson, but mind you, the indents look
    rather long. Also, it would be good to introduce some hyphenation to improve the
    word spacing."

    to be more truly representative of the quality of old letterpress than more polished
    revivals. The digital Janson and Granjon also strike me as being a bit slick.\r\n\r\nVerdigris,

  body: Nick, you classify William's Caslon as a Garalde? It's in the lineage -- Garamond,
    Granjon, Antwerp, Holland, Caslon --, but its separated by 200+ years and the
    whole Dutch mannerist and baroque.

    Jannon is more \"earthy and rustic\" than Garamond. BTW, I once\r\nmade a letterpress
    keepsake about ATF Garamond (another Jannon) using\r\nreduced wine in the ink,
    and the wine was from Jannon's birthplace.  :-)\r\n\r\nLike check <em>this</em>

  body: "Thank you.\r\nCaslon has certain serifs which are more differentiated from
    the stems, but other than that the structures and proportions are quite similar,
    informed as they are by the broad nib pen. And many letters are practically identical,
    e.g. \u2018A\u2019 and \u201Ca\u2019 right off the bat.\r\nIsn\u2019t that the
    idea of \u2018Garalde\u2019?\u2014it\u2019s old-style, but not Venetian, which
    preceded it. Then it was followed by Transitional.\r\nMaybe a lot of the similarity
    is in the interpretations.\r\nAdobe Garamond and Williams Caslon:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garaldes_4613.png]"

  body: "The only thing I would offer about the original poster's question is to recommend
    that he look at offset printed examples, and not rely only on the screen. \r\n\r\nCaslon
    is obviously in the line of Griffo-Garamond, and an old style, as Nick mentions.
    It also has some significant differences, as John notes. Whether to classify it
    as a separate category or as a variation seems to me somewhat arbitrary, and dependent
    on the purpose of the classification. I haven't studied the various \"Dutch\"
    and French faces from the previous century, the 17th century, so I don't know
    how much they share with Caslon. \r\n\r\nI'd heard it said that the \"go\xFBt
    Hollandaise\" came from the Dutch being accustomed to black letter. Thus the Dutch
    roman types tend to be a bit blacker with shorter extenders. The aesthetic of
    Caslon is obviously different from Garamond, with Garmond being more delicate
    and elegant, and Caslon having a more robust, feet-on-the-ground feeling. \r\n\r\nBringhurst
    points out that \"Baroque\" faces, which is where he puts Caslon, have more variation
    in stress (mixing oblique and vertical stress), and are still more modeled and
    less calligraphic than Garamond. I think the latter is particularly important.
    I see in Nick's comparison lines that my Caslon is generally a bit narrower than
    Adobe Garamond.   My proportions are pretty true to Caslon's Pica 2, and to me
    the somewhat narrower proportions is an important characteristic also. I should
    also confess, for clarity in this discussion, that I think Caslon's g's are ugly,
    so I drew a shape that looks more agreeable to my eyes. It is closer to Garamond
    than Caslon's own letter g is."
