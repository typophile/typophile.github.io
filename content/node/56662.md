  serif fonts. I am in the middle of putting together a coffee-table book which has
  some paragraphs of text here and there but otherwise is mostly photographic.\r\n\r\nI
  am not overly in love with Hadriano Std (which is what I'm currently using) and
  am planning a font switch. At this point, having never done a coffee-table book
  before, I am wondering as to whether a sans serif typeface is recommended? Or, apart
  from the sans serif / serif debate, what some recommended coffee-table-type fonts
  may be.\r\n\r\nThanks much!"

    depends what feel you want to \r\ncommunicate, what the photos are about (sad,
    funny,\r\netc), who is going to read the book (old, young, \r\nmale, female, etc)?
    \r\n\r\nI think in the end you have to treat the book like\r\nevery other design
    project and by answering \r\nthe basic questions it will get you closer to your
    \r\nfont choice."

  body: "I wonder whether your approach has to do with captions. There was a school
    of thought that held that if the text is serif, the captions can be sans-serif.
    So it, sort-of, follows that if you only have captions, you should be in sans-serif.
    However, in most books the main face is serif (for various reasons). Check some
    cook books.\r\n\r\nI would say that you are free to do as you wish. Whatever you
    fancy?"

    Franklin Gothic is right up the sans serif alley for what I was visualizing -
    thanks!

  body: "<em>\"I wonder whether your approach has to do with captions.\"</em>\r\nThis
    is an interesting thought. I'll admit that for the two coffee-table-ish books
    I've worked on so far, I leaned towards sans serifs as well (once Fedra Sans Alt,
    once Legato), and your explanation for this sounds pretty good. FWIW, I mostly
    feel that whoever looks at a coffee-table book doesn't usually want to <em>read</em>
    for hours, and sans serifs seem to be good at communicating that \"don't worry,
    this text isn't long\", plus \"this book is not primarily about <em>reading</em>\".
    I often feel that usual seriffed/\"book\" text faces would give the text in a
    coffee-table book too much of a \"bookish\" flavor. If that makes any sense."

  body: "Indeed Altaira - agree 100%. What I was thinking was that the serif might
    somewhat \"trap/fishhook\" the reader rather than the sans-serif \"freeing\" the
    reader to leave the text and look at the photographs. This was somewhat the basis
    for my question in the first place - wondering if perhaps a sans-serif font would
    actually be preferable for this kind of project due to its cleaner look/feel.
    I am tossing various ideas back and forth and doing a lot of undo & redo in InDesign.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the input. Legato appears to be a good lead that I will have to investigate. "
