body: "I went on a design spree and finished this up within about 2 days.  There are
  still a few rough edges like some of the horizontal guides not all being <em>exactly</em>
  the same height (off by 1 unit or less).  It seems to maintain its connectedness
  and while the two Arabic speaking friends I had both said it was \"readable\", since
  they're not design majors I can't trust them beyond that :)\r\n\r\nThis was designed
  to be a part of my megafont Coru\xF1a, so I attempted to maintain color and weight
  accordingly (see the mix with Greek / Cyrillic / Tifinagh), but I'm pretty sure
  I avoided most of the pitfalls of Latin-users making other scripts, e.g., highly
  variable x-, descender-, and ascender-height, etc.\r\n\r\nA brutal critique (if
  needed) is welcome, so <em>please</em> don't hold back if it needs tearing apart."

  body: It is heartening to see type designers seeking to match various scripts in
    one font. We have this problem in almost all Indian languages and it is yet to
    be solved. I cannot speak for Arabic or any of the other scripts included in the
    font, since I cannot read, write or speak those languages. They look quite well
    matched and have an even texture. But the structure of Roman script is quite puzzling
    as so many styles have been mixed making the composed Roman text look quite bizarre.
    I am sure, if you can spend more time on it, you may be able to improve upon it.

  body: "I'm not sure what kind of comment you are looking for. Your friends were
    right. It's readable. This is impressive for a 2 days effort. But for another
    2 years of effort, you will still be in the realm of 'readability' of your Arabic
    text... only slightly better!\r\nYou might be better off focusing on Roman languages
    for your font. I personally discourage using Arabic in a Roman font. Roman in
    Arabic font is more manageable -and more necessary."

    connected Y is wrong in what you have so far. In arabic calligraphy standards,
    it really shouldn't be pointed. The detached Y is better, I like the end of the
    tail (although it's not a traditional aproach)  it mimiks you roman. However the
    beginning of that Y, it's a little too thick up there. The bottom curve is beautiful,
    but the top curve has stroke thickness problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kurunya_4270.jpg]\r\n\r\nthe
    Kaf is absolutely beautiful, again the top right tip isn't traditional but it
    looks like the roman. Now the Waw is perfect but the following letter the R it's
    totally off compared to the Waw. The descenders in the Waw and the R should be
    really the same. there's no reason why the R should be bigger. The R is one of
    those letter that are Huge in your typeface, the \"Dal\" on the other hand is
    slightly tiny, I can understand what happened in the case of the Dal, but the
    R should match the Waw.\r\nThe Nun is beautiful too, I can understand why it's
    slightly slanted and pointed (to match the Roman) but the middle Y that follows
    it is just too big again. It is both thicker and taller than the Nun and that
    makes it look like a hybrid. You might want to make a middle Y or a middle Nun
    straighter than a Beginning Nun or Beh but the x height should be the same really.\r\n\r\nThe
    final Aleph like all the Alephs in your typeface I like it, it is coherent with
    the roman, however you should be super careful with the stroke thickness in proportion
    to other letterforms.\r\n\r\nThere is still a lot more to be said. Overall at
    this point I can compare it to a roman typeface where some of the letterforms
    are slab and some are old-style.\r\nPart of your challenge is that you can't speak
    or read the language but hey Herman Zapf designed a metal typeface for an Egyptian
    newspaper in the fifties and it was still used until not a long time ago. He didn't
    speak the language but his design was an influence on some digital Arabic typefaces.
    It's a very challenging task. I have never learned traditional Arabic calligraphy
    but if you have questions don't hesitate.\r\nGood luck"

  body: "Thanks for the comments, I'm already working on a few changes.\r\n\r\nI knew
    that Arabic has less defined vertical heights, so I tried to vary them, I guess
    I got too carried away with it.  It's interesting that most here are finding parallels
    with the Roman version, when actually most of the Arabic was based off of the
    Greek version :)\r\n\r\nWhich of these final yehs do you think works best?  Also,
    when you say the R and waw should be more similar, is that just for the descender
    part (the curve is the same, just lower and wider) or also for above the base
    line?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coruna_yeh_variations_4357.png]\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Ok, the space after the Nun is slightly too big right now. I will say that
    number 4 is not bad at all, 1&2 have weird proportions, in 3 the fact that there's
    that lift from the basline that is making the horizontal stroke thinner is very
    awkward.\r\nSo 4 is good: the tail is nice maybe a tiny bit lower. Now when you
    want to create your detached Y base it on number 4, cut the attaching area and
    replace it with the swash that goes all the way up to the x-height.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of which, I think you should have a descender line an ascender line and an x-height.
    So descenders like the tails of the R and the Waw should be fairly similar if
    not exactly the same, kinda like the ascender on a \"b\" and a \"d\".\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if I mentioned that before but the two dots should align horizontally,
    I don't want to restrain your creativity, but really if you get rid of the upper
    dot on your three dots, that's how your two dots should look."
