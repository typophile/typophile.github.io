body: "I've attached a sample spread from my grad project (one part of it) it's a
  publication series that is composed of cultural ephemera from various 'island nations'.
  This particular aspect is a sort of 'hub' for the rest of the publication, it's
  a travel guide to these island nation / utopias. \r\n\r\nI've gotten it to a stage
  where I am fairly happy, just wanted to hear from fresh eyes. There are a few things
  I am unsure about; how do are the page numbers / running heads working? are they
  not anchored enough? Is the line length for the marginalia too short? General comments
  about how it feels / navigates would be appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nIn case some
  more context is required; the finished book will be about 100 pages (50 islands
  for Volume 1) and the size is about half-letter (5.5 x 8.5). The typeface used is
  Galaxie Polaris by Chester & Tracy Jenkins.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    But I guess you will probably know them. :)\r\n\r\nOn topic: I think your example
    does mimic a travel guide quite well.\r\nMaybe it does look a bit 'serious', so
    to speak, but then again the lay-out is primarily to transfer information. However,
    maybe it could use a bit of flair, if you know what I mean.\r\n"

  body: "I'd lose the hyphenation -- you've got two consecutive ones in the verso
    main text that really don't make much sense, and things like \"re-cent\" are just
    jarring.  I like the marginalia, but the hyphens on the recto aren't very comfortable
    either.\r\n\r\nYour use of colour is very nice, but it does feel a little sterile
    -- you might want to think about using a sans with a touch more warmth and contrast
    to it."

  body: "Agreement on the hyphenation.  The marginal texts' measures are just too
    short.\r\n\r\nThere are a few too many horizontal rules.  I kind of like them
    at the foot of the marginalia, but then again I'm not sure they're necessary.
    \ The rule at the end of the body text seems superfluous.\r\n\r\nThis is a tiny
    thing, but I'd equalize the space before & after the subheads' gray square bullet.
    \ Or maybe even drop the bullet entirely and use an em space to separate the subhead
    from the text.\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: "Thanks for the comments,\r\n\r\nQuincunx: Yeah, I remember reading about
    San Serriffe a few years back, as for the 'seriousness' I think I wanted to stick
    to that because the rest of the publication really diverges from the serious look.
    But I agree if this was all there was it could use more flair.\r\n\r\nLinda Cunningham:
    I think I chose Galaxie Polaris because it has a very 'open' feeling to it, I
    think it lends the page a nice balance. I did an initial version with an overt
    friendliness and warmth, but since the content verges from dreary to (perhaps)
    humourous I thought a touch of sterility would contrast with the content itself.
    If that makes any sense.\r\n\r\njslabovitz: Yes, superfluous is a fitting word,
    I've been on the verge of taking it out for a while though, but you can never
    really convince yourself of some things till you hear it from someone else."

  body: "I like it. It's very clean, which is perfect for a travel guide. I agree
    with Linda's comment about the sterility though. I might get yelled at for this,
    but I wonder what the blue sidebars would look like justified.\r\n\r\nI know it's
    not in your initial question, but I feel like the image needs a compass rose or
    a marker for the capital. Although I like the simplified look, I think it's needs
    something more.\r\n\r\nBut I like it overall."

  body: "Absolutely, it needs some sort of directional indicator: not necessarily
    a full rose, but at least a \"North\" arrow would be useful.\r\n\r\nI'm sure detailing
    all the maps (assuming they are different) is beyond the time you can/need/want
    to spend, but some content there would be useful.\r\n\r\nJustifying the sidebars
    really would be awkward -- they're just too narrow.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, unless
    you're setting guide books like telephone books (with flimsy paper, minimal graphics,
    and totally jejune text), you really need some warmth in your text face.  It's
    late (for me), but offhand, both ITC Tiepolo and Poppl-Laudatio spring to mind...."
