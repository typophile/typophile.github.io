  body: I thought so too, Nicolai, but the &#34;S&#34; and &#34;D&#34; are wider,
    and the &#34;M&#34; is different &#40;even Bitstream&#39;s version with less pronounced
    ink traps is not the right M&#41;. Maybe it&#39;s a pre-digital version of Avant
    Garde?

  body: Yeah, i was thinking about Avant Garde myself, but the weight in the diagonals
    M &amp; N dont seem to match. Customized maybe? Other foundry version?
