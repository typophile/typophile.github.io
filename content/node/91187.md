  called Bob for you to download use for whatever you want.\r\nSome might remember
  the previous 'Kontrapunkt' typeface released 10 years ago. It is of course still
  for download and available on our website, too. For the release of the new typeface
  we also designed a microwebsite with a playful type-tester in javascript and HTML5.\r\n\r\nYou
  can download the typefaces and try them out here:\r\nhttp://www.kontrapunkt.com/type/\r\n\r\nPlease
  do share your opinions on the typefaces here on the board or on twitter via hashtag
  #kptype\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nPhilip Battin"

  body: I hope this'll communicate as useful feedback, not complaint.  I have an older
    PC and a dial-up Internet connection.  The WEB page for "Bob" displays, but it
    is so "busy" with non-stop animation that it would never settle down and let me
    press the download button.  That is, I tried, but the animation continued unaffected
    and the cursor never changed to a "finger pointer" to tell me the browser was
    ready to start the download.  So, I can be tantalized by the offer but can never
    secure the font!  Is this download available on a quiet or still site, maybe an
    archive, where an old dinosaur can also download it?  I very much appreciate the
    offer of a usable free font.  I just don't understand why many font WEB site designers
    load up their sites with bandwidth and processor-demanding Flash, Java, and other
    animations that add nothing to the experience.  There are attractive sites where
    I can still visit with my old equipment and see a prompt display and download
    quickly.  (Blambot's a good example, but not the only one.)   Others take a while
    to display, but they do finally function.  I may be in a minority of font-loving
    users with restricted access, but surely I'm not the only one.  Further, you can
    showcase your design skills without all the complicated stuff; and everybody who
    shows up will be able to enjoy and take advantage of it.   Thanks for listening,
    and thanks for the offer -- maybe someday I'll be able to take advantage of it.

    you use? Do you know how much memory and how fast your PC is?\r\n\r\nBest regards"

  body: "Yes, thank you for the courteous, professional response.   I appreciated
    that very much.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this note is my reply to Philip's question
    about my PC and browser specs.  Other readers, if that sounds too much off-topic
    or you just don't care, just stop reading here.  No harm, no foul.\r\n\r\nThese
    specifics describe my surfing PC, but I am sure they are not typical; and I can
    almost hear guffawing as people read them  However, there are still a great many
    people who do surf with dial-up, PCs with 2MB or less of memory,  and versions
    of Windows no longer supported by MS.  I use K-Meleon 1.5.3 to surf, which, though
    based on Firefox, is stripped, more efficient code cleaned to run on older, slower
    computers.  It also provides the higher level of encryption many sites demand.
    \ There's a newer version, but it's based on different code and won't run on my
    OS.  The PC is an Acer-built IBM Aptiva which originally could only support a
    single MB of RAM and 6GB max hard drives.  I've patched the Win95 and put in another
    controller card, so now it's juggling 300 GB without problems.  I've replaced
    the power supply a couple of times.  It's also on a wireless network to my Vista
    PC and some Win98 PCs, which several technicians told me would never be possible
    after MS scrapped the old Novel networking protocol and tricked up TCP/IP so the
    new can't talk to the old.   Though the processor speed is slow, I think only
    165 MHz, it is faster than the dial-up Internet connection requires.  I generally
    have few, if any, problems surfing WEB sites.  According to a database I maintain,
    I've visited more than 3,000 font and typeface-related URLs.  Last night at FontSquirrel
    and Ascender Corp.\r\n\r\nWhy, people ask, do I surf with this antique when I
    also own a Vista and a Win7 PC that I keep off-line?  There are several reasons,
    but some of the more important are that (1) it's really surprising how well it
    works.  With K-Meleon, I am able to access and use almost all the WEB sites I
    wish.  I cannot, however, run the latest versions of Java or Flash.  On the rare
    occasion I really need speed, I carry my Win7 laptop to the public library, where
    savings from using their free Wi-Fi paid for the laptop in less than a year.  As
    an example, to download the Open Office Suite takes about 12 hours at home, if
    I'm not cut off.  At the library, 12 minutes.  (2) Almost all the new malware
    targets features my machine's OS  does not have.  I still run anti-virus, a firewall,
    \ and a pop-blocker, but the box has dodged all sorts of attempts to  harm it
    and my data.  (3) The final reason is learning curve.  Despite its limitations,
    I've just about mastered all it and my software can do.  I can usually do better
    and faster work with my old machine than most of my friends with the latest and
    greatest.   I can work as or more quickly on the old PC than on either of the
    new ones with far greater tech specs.  In fact,  friends with much newer equipment
    and software call me to solve problems and sometimes to undo damage.\r\n\r\nIf
    thist leads to making more WEB sites accessible to more visitors, I guess it'll
    be worth the embarrassment of detailing how much good service I'm still getting
    from my \"Model T\" PC.  (I do not, however, go on-line with my old CP/M KayPro;
    though it still works, too.)\r\n\r\nLater"

    with 160 Megs of store and a 550MHz CPU running Win98se. I normally use K-Meleon
    1.5.4 which, as stated above, is the GT version of Firefox 2. Occasionally I use
    IE6, [[http://dillo-win32.sourceforge.net/|Dillo-win32]] or a real FF2.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    yes, I had to use ^Underhanded trickery to get at the download link as the browser
    was too busy with the dancing elephants to react to clicking on it. Most uncute."
