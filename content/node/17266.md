    page at http://www.houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=140 - in a wide
    variety of styles, according to a House Industries catalog \"...ten typefaces
    in three unique styles is the creative genius of acclaimed clothing designer [[Rene
    Albert Chalet]].\" \r\n\r\nJordan"

    actually exist! This whole marketing angle is one of the coolest things about
    Chalet, in my opinion. \r\n\r\nChalet's design is pure House, not a revival or
    digtization of any specific source."

  body: "I've always been irritated by the naming convention used in Chalet. Instead
    of defining the weights/styles by a more rational method, they've used seemingly
    arbitrary descriptors like \"London 1980\" or \"New York 1960.\" I can never remember
    which one is which.\r\n\r\n"

    fooled at first, which I hope says more about my knowledge of fashion designers
    than my knowledge of type. I suspect Jean-Fran\xE7ois is still laughing at me.
    He sent me a sample and asked me what I thought of this Chalet guy's work. Well,
    what I thought was that he had ripped off Helvetica for his entire 1960 line."

  body: "Um, ok, I believed that this guy Rene Albert Chalet existed. Don't believe
    everything you read in print I guess. I didn't think to check the name, and while
    the history of art was a part of my curriculum at school, fashion designers didn't
    figure in much. Oh I confess I'm so gullible. But a chalet is a place where you
    stay in the mountains on ski holidays, isn't it?\r\nJordan the gullible"

  body: You guys just burst my bubble. Guess JFP has someone new to laugh at... Why
    would I have any reason to look elsewhere to see if Chalet was a real dude? House...
    shame on your sham... I suppose now you're going to tell me that [[John Downer]]
    isn't really a romance novel cover model (See House's marketing for<em>[[Paperback]]</em>.)
