  body: "I don't believe the logo was created using a single typeface. It looks like
    the \"ee\" in iteem are just reduced copies of the \"e2\" logo which looks slightly
    modified or redrawn from a Modern serif \"e.\"\r\n\r\nThe image is kinda small...
    is that a little flat serif at the bottom left stem of the  \"m\"?"

  body: To my untrained eye, it looks like they might have been inspired by the type
    treatment in the Hilton logo - the horizontal tail of the 't' and the wide rectangular
    dot on the 'i' bring it to mind anyway.
