  body: I have long been a fan of schematics and the lack of conscious design inherent
    in most, the form of text instead arising from requirement and contrast with the
    technical illustrations. Some very interesting older documents (manuals, articles
    and schematics) can be found on the [[http://www.one-electron.com/Misc_Docs.html|one
    electron site]].

  body: Many of these types of manuals are for companies that prefer not to make them
    public.  However, there are technical textbooks with good typography. Good usually
    means unobtrusive, though.

  body: If "technical manuals" refers to in-house manuals or instruction manuals,
    good design often isn't the highest priority since they aren't marketing pieces.
    But you might look for pieces produced by companies that view design as being
    important (Apple, IBM, Knoll, etc.).
