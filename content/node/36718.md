body: I'm particularly curious about people's methods when they're seeking jobs in
  the design industry. For example, how would someone go about nabbing a job at say,
  Pentagram? There's something i can't figure out.

  body: Pentagram is organized differently. As fas as I know it's a small network
    of otherwise separate design agencies. To participate there needs to be an invitation

  body: If you want to work at Pentagram, call them up. Show them your portfolio.
    If you're talented and the timing is right you'll get a job. It's a design agency,
    not the Illuminati.

  body: "I interview designers regularly. I look for a few things.\r\n\r\nFirst, they
    need to be able to do great work. Even if you are just out of school - we don't
    expect you to be at your peak, but we need to see great problem solving skills,
    strong typography skills ..etc. All the building blocks necessary for you to grow
    into a great designer.\r\n\r\nSecond, we look for people that will fit our culture.
    We like intelligent, productive and talented designers who have a nice dose of
    humility. We don't care too much for egos and arrogance. We are all proud of the
    work we do and we know we do good work. But, we are good people and we like to
    keep it that way.\r\n\r\nThird, we look for people who understand the business
    side of what we are doing. Many designers are just looking to design, but they
    have no idea how they fit into the over scheme of the biz - what they cost the
    business and what kind of value they need to create for the business to continue
    and to justify their salary.\r\n\r\nA designer who exhibits the above traits will
    get a job with us every time. In fact, I'll make room for them, because they are
    a great investment and I would not want them to end-up down the street with my
    competition.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike"

    You know... be pro-active.  :-)"

  body: From what I can tell, most design firms advertise open positions on their
    web sites, and if they need to fill it fast they post on Craigslist. If you want
    to network, go to AIGA meetings with a pile of cash and buy lots of drinks for
    other people.

  body: "Don't be a cheapskate when you go out networking at some professional event.
    Buy a few drinks and pick up the tab once in a while. If you invite someone out
    for lunch or dinner to pick their brain, remember to pay the bill. Don't even
    suggest you split it. \r\n\r\nDo not get the reputation as someone who never pays
    for anything. Believe me, people may not remember all the times you pick up the
    tab, but they do remember the people who NEVER pick up the tab. "
