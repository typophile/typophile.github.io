  successful typefamily Skolar by David B\u0159ezina, has been extended to a pan-European
  character set. This version supports around 90 languages that use the Latin, Cyrillic,
  or Greek scripts, featuring over 2400 glyphs. The Cyrillic was awarded a Special
  Diploma at the international type design competition Modern Cyrillic 2009 and won
  the first prize in the Cyrillic text type category at Granshan 2009. As a bonus,
  Skolar PE can correctly place any accent from the font above or below all Latin
  letters, a useful feature for many linguistic applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nread more
