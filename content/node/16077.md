  Griffith Gothic, and Officina Sans. (Slab-serifs and monospaced typewriter faces
  need not apply.) The ideal candidate would be a relatively quiet sans (Helvarial)
  with a serifed I. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    sans and get permission from the foundry to modify it?

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions, guys. I felt kinda silly afer Hrant's suggestion.
    ;)\r\n\r\nI considered that, Stephen. I'm doing this as a favor to my brother,
    who is looking for something to use in an engraving/manufacturing process where
    differentiating between l,I, and the number 1 is important. He'd like something
    he can ask his 5-6 vendors to purchase and use on everything they produce. They're
    currently using Arial -- what do you put my odds of getting Monotype to allow
    modification and distribution of that one?"

  body: "That would be an excellent solution, Hrant. Not sure if it's feasible in
    this case -- my brother will likely run into resistance from his vendors even
    for asking them to fork over a few bucks for a font, and he's hesistant to approach
    his superiors about a custom face, since they don't see any problem with the current
    situation. But I'll present that idea as an option.\r\n\r\nChester, thanks for
    pointing out Flama. I've come close to using it for some projects of my own, but
    hadn't noticed the I before."
