  [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the-b-side/|B Side]] and I
  saw this new identity for Blurb, a company that allows people to self produce books.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blurb_4001.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow,
  I'm still not that confident about distinguishing good kerning from bad kerning;
  and everybody seems to be commenting, there, on how the kerning of the new logo
  is much improved over the kerning on the old logo, but I don't really see that.\r\n\r\nIs
  this true? Do you agree with that? Which version has better kerning?"

  body: Do you see how the old version is spaced so that it looks almost like a monospaced
    typeface? The letters all feel stilted and separate as if they don't like each
    other very much. The new letters by comparison flow into one another and feel
    more united as a word. The kerning isn't perfect on the new one, but it is better.

  body: "Ok, that I can perfectly see; the letters are standing tall, almost proud,
    separate to each other in the previous version.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about balancing
    the inner space of the letters with the space between letters, we're talking about
    total area, really, and not about just the optical width of the spaces, right?
    So that, for instance, if we take the \u201Cu\u201D in the previous version: if
    we measured both the area of the spaces before and after it and the area of its
    inner space, we'd find out that there\u2019s (a lot?) more space around the letter
    than inside it; whereas if we do the same thing with the new version, the numbers
    are probably a lot closer, even though optically it seems to have much more space
    inside it than outside.\r\n\r\nIs this correct? It seems obvious and I've known
    this for quite a while, but I still can't \u201Csee it\u201D, intuitively look
    at it and know it\u2019s not balanced."

    learned its a basic way to see the letterspacing with sort of new eyes. You're
    no longer seeing a word but instead the shapes and their spatial relationship
    with each other.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blurb_4439.png]"
