  Fontshop & Fonts.com but I am yet to be able to find out the level of clear type
  hinting which has been applied by the foundry. We require it to be hand hinted rather
  than auto hinted as the result are far better.\r\n\r\nI wondered if anyone could
  help me with some info on this, here are a few links to the sources:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webtype.com/font/bentonsans-regular-family/\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/font-bureau/benton-sans\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/benton_sans_ot/\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: Currently, the hand-hinted webfont versions of <a href=http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonsans-complete-family-1/>Benton
    Sans</a> are only offered for web licensing from Webtype. If you're planning to
    set smaller body type online, you may also be interested in <a href=http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonsansre-family/>Benton
    Sans RE</a>, as Frode mentioned. The RE ("Reading Edge") fonts were designed from
    scratch and hand-hinted specifically for use at smaller sizes on the screen.
