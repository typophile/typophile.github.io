  body: There is a <a href="http://www.dvd-shop.ch/detail.php?products_id=74919">
    documentary</a> about Adrian Frutiger, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s available
    in English though.. It&#39;s very interesting, you get to watch him flip through
    his old sketchbooks, help someone at Linotype tweak letterforms, etc..

  body: Wow that&#39;s realy cool, I didn&#39;t know they made videos on typographers.
    I wonder if there&#39;s an English version.  <BR>Oh and I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re
    realy leaning on videos on Eric Gill but there are some of books on him and by
    him that are somewhat interesting.
