body: "Dear members,\r\n\r\nI have a specific geo-typographic question and was hoping
  you could help me out. I'll be travelling to Brussels towards the end of the month
  and I'll have a couple of days' spare time on my hands - I wanted to know whether
  you could possibly suggest some sights of typographic interest in the vicinity.
  I'll certainly visit The Printing Museum, but other than that I haven't found very
  much on the Internet.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance for your suggestions\r\nand
  all the best from Budapest,\r\n\r\nAkos"

    If not, I'll just drown my sorrows in chocolate :)

  body: Belgian chocolate definitely. A visit to La Cambre school of art. An opportunity
    to see the first Futura fonts (the primitive one) still in use and the Lemmen
    font designed for Harry Kessler and Henry van de Velde.
