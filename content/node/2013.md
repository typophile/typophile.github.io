  on Art Deco era advertising. Any ideas on the closest digital version I could find?  <BR>

  body: That&#39;s pretty swift, Troy. It&#39;s got a Beton/Rockwell shape  <BR>with
    some rounded wildcards tossed in. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s <BR>anything quite
    like it.

  body: Dover has a <a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/by-subject-art-dover-electronic-display-fonts-series--cd-rom-.html">series
    of cds</a> with display fonts compiled by Dan X. Solo. The font you want might
    be on one of them -- unfortunately, I haven&#39;t found an easy way to know exactly
    what&#39;s on there. You might just have to go to a bookstore or art supplies
    store and look at them in person. Hope that isn&#39;t a wild-goose chase.

  body: I don&#39;t think the font is in one of the Solotype disks. I got a listing
    once of what was on them. Anyway, I think this typeface is Linotype Memphis, which
    had identical alternate characters to the A &amp; M shown here. See attached scan
    from 1930&#39;s Linotype Catalog. However, I can&#39;t see any evidence that the
    digital version of Memphis has these characters.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20228.gif"

  body: The sample is surely Memphis. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know how Memphis was digitized?
    It seems that a lot of the original character of the face was changed, the lowercase
    g was substituted with its alternate, the numerals were also altered. Anyone know
    why?
