  blog</a>.\r\n\r\nKind words, and thanks Chris. I'm glad the inside cover was a highlight.
  It made so much sense to show off the process of Underware's design for the inside
  cover because it epitomizes their process. It also makes the selected cover that
  much more interesting when you see what it could have been.\r\n\r\nGood design takes
  risks. I'm glad you enjoyed the risks we took with the bit of play we did with the
  Underware article. Reversed type isn't always appreciated by everybody.\r\n\r\nOne
  anecdote about Marian Bantjes... When we asked her if we could supply her with fonts
  for the piece she sent a list of 13 fonts. She wrote, \"Honest! I might use them
  all! I'm not a minimalist...\" I was skeptical that she'd be able to pull it off,
  but I shouldn't have doubted."
