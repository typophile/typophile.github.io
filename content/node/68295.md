  body: "Hi Jean. There\u2019s a lot of nice stuff going on here. I particulary like
    the d/b/p/q curves. They do, however, not fit all that well with the rest of your
    letters. It\u2019ll probably be easier to see once you add some weight. Helvetica
    (your starting point) is a (neo) grotesque: see how the curve of the n starts
    low on the first stroke and forms a 180 degree half circle, how the terminals
    of letters like s/e/c/a closes up following the same (or a similar) half circle
    shape. The main characteristics of your design doesn\u2019t share much with Helvetica.
    Perhaps that is a good thing (I think so), but you need to be consistent. If you\u2019re
    sticking with open humanist forms like the e/s, the same openness should be evident
    in the rest of your letters.\r\n\r\nAlso, remember to consider overshots (round
    shapes look lower than flat shapes, a sharp v/A apex also needs to descend or
    ascend ever so slightly) and optical adjustments (ex: the u look too wide when
    it\u2019s as wide as the n). Trust your eyes more than the numbers :)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    far from an expert, so please take my advice with a grain of salt."

  body: "Good idea with this, it's looking promising.\r\n\r\nI agree that overall
    it doesn't share too much with Helvetica and I also think this is a good thing.
    The curves on the letters Frode mentioned are really nice: clean and elegant.
    A good direction to go in. \r\n \r\nI do kind of miss the earlier /g/ - it was
    quite quirky and the top and bottom loops created an interesting balance. I can
    see how the new one would probably work better though in general use, maybe keep
    the previous one as an alt? Seems a shame to lose it.\r\n\r\nLike Paul mentioned
    in the other thread, the simplicity of the previous /G/ is very nice with its
    lovely smooth curve. I'd be curious to see how that idea would work with this
    new width.  \r\n\r\nI much prefer this new /Q/ the tail seems much more comfortable.
    I also like the /K/ more this way than the earlier treatment. While an interesting
    idea, it seemed to me a little out of place. The /r/ is also much better.\r\n\r\nNice
    work so far! Looking forward to seeing it progress. "

  body: "Thanks for your input Claire and Frode!\r\n\r\nI think I wasn't clear when
    I said I'm using Helvetica as basis for this new design. It is certainly not my
    intention to copy Helvetica or parts thereof. I just like the general feel of
    Helvetica Light Extended; it's so clean, clear and crisp, yet over-used and not
    quite readable in smaller sizes because of it's lack of openness. It's my intention
    to recreate that same feel, but more open to optimise readability.\r\n\r\nI myself
    am quite pleased too with the curves on /b/, /d/, /p/ and /q/. It's nice to know
    you two agree. These glyphs will be my startingpoint for others. I started out
    with stemless /n/, /m/, /r/, /g/ and other glyphs and I am going to keep them
    as alts, since you like 'm! \r\n\r\nThanks for your sharp insight on the apexes,
    Frode! I'll check them again and take a closer look at overshoots and /u/.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Claire, maybe I'll keep my first draft of /G/ as an alt as well. \r\n\r\nFinally,
    and I think this goes for most amateur type designers, I want to create a font
    that isn't boring, perhaps with a little bit of quirkyness and fun, yet useable
    as body text. It's hard...\r\n\r\nThanks again Claire and Frode! I'll keep working!"

    a heavier weight is a must. Good luck! I\u2019ll follow your postings here. You
    don\u2019t need to start a new thread, btw. Most of the old timers follow the
    tracker (instead of the frontpage) where new posts to old threads will still show
    up on the first page."

  body: "Hi Claire and Frode,\r\nI've updated the design, please check out the 'Boon'
    PDF. The text in this PDF is set in AI, so don't mind kerning et cetera. The font
    size is about 9 points.\r\n\r\nNo alts yet (serious computer problems)...\r\n\r\nDo
    you think the apexes are better this way? I've looked at Futura Light for inspiration.\r\nI've
    also changed overshoots, narrowed /u/ a tiny bit and opened up the counters even
    more."

  body: "The /C/ is much nicer - I love the curve and the counter being more open
    looks good. \r\n\r\nWhile I like the /B/ at a bigger size, I'm not entirely sold
    on it in small text. There's something that bugs me a little the combination of
    the curves in the upper and bottom bowls, or maybe how it sits on the baseline..
    I'm not sure what to suggest though, so that isn't entirely useful! However, the
    similar treatment does work well I think on the P/R/D.\r\n\r\nAt first glance,
    I'm finding it hard to judge its readability at smaller sizes in such a light
    weight. Like Frode said, a heavier weight is definitely a must. \r\n\r\nOh and
    I love the italic /f/, very nice!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You were all right: it was too thin. So, i've made it heavier (still not
    very heavy though), in fact it's just as heavy as Helvetica ULE. Please check
    Boon_2.pdf.\r\nI see what you mean with /B/. All take a good look at it this week."

  body: "Try printing a long text at these point sizes, and I suspect you\u2019ll
    find it unreadable and extremely tiring. The ideal weight for something that is
    supposed to be read is in the ballpark of book types like Garamond and Caslon,
    and most type designers will even tell you most digital versions of those old
    classics are way to thin."
