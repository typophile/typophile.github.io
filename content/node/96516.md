  line left indent function in indesign...is there like a golden rule in how much
  \"mm\" (mine is set to mm) a first line left indent at the beginning of each paragraph
  should be in comparison to the font size and/or leading used in a document?\r\n\r\nFor
  example i'm using a typeface (Mercury) at 10pt and the leading is 12,7pt, should
  i set the left indent according to the font size or is it just all a matter of whatever
  works best for you?\r\n\r\nAll help is appreciated"

  body: The golden rule is that the indent should be as wide as an imaginary perfect
    square described by the left margin, the baseline of the line above, and the x-height
    of the line below. The fourth side will then describe the indent.

    a good proportion that works for both narrow and wide column settings and adapts
    quite well even for very wide linespacing.\r\n\r\nThe other method is that suggested
    by Claus, creating an optical square, but this results in a deeper indent than
    I usually like, and the squareness ends up being variable depending whether the
    line below starts with ascender letters of all x-height."

  body: Occasionally in old publications (early 20th century) and in typewritten letters
    from that period I've seen huge indents; like maybe 1/3 the width of the line.
    I was never sure if that was common in those days or just an oddity.

  body: Carolina, as a standard rule, I set the indent measure as the same of the
    em dash of the typeface I'm using in the paragraph. I have exeperienced that,
    for example, in a Garalde set at 11 points, this measure turns out to be - approximately
    - at 3,5 mm or 4 mm. If it appears to be too big, I decrease it a little (from
    4 to 3,5 mm.; the first line indent shouldn't be too big). This way, it usually
    works fine for me. I'm not totally sure, but I think I read this "em dash method"
    somewhere in a Jan Tschichold's essay.

    anything in a ragged right margin that suggests the need for a larger than normal

    etc. strikes me as stylistic rather than functional in this regard (ironically,
    often the result of modernist experiments despite their designers' frequent appeals

  body: I'm still trying to understand <em>what</em> about the ragged right makes
    a deep indent on the left seem necessary to you. So far as I see it, there is
    no connection between the two, and the indent retains its primary importance in
    relationship to the <em>left</em> margin. The eye, reaching the end of the line,
    jumps to the beginning of the next line, which is to say to the left margin. Hence,
    the indent that is merely a visual indicator of a structural division of the text
    should be as deep as necessary to be unambiguous <em>and no deeper.</em> Unmooring
    the first line of a paragraph from the left margin with a deep indent means the
    reader has to go looking for it, instead of simply jumping to the left margin
    as usual. The overall visual affects of deep indents (and wide linespacing) on
    a page have dramatic visual impact, but they have nothing to do with the mechanics
    of reading, so don't serve the text or the reader.

    Those 'other spaces over there' seems to me to have nothing to do with what is
    happening on the left margin, which is nothing out of the ordinary for normal
    reading. So why introduce something that is out of the ordinary? As for the ragged
    right producing visual noise on the page, I agree, and I think the deep indent
    on the left only increases that visual noise: it certainly seems to in the 1976
    Olympics page spreads to which Maxim linked. I think one of the reasons why adding
    space between paragraphs and not indenting them became a popular solution for
    ragged right text is precisely because making a consistent left margin anchors
    the text better and reduces the noise. And, of course, Eric Gill's solution for
    ragged right setting in his essay on typography was to get rid of the paragraph
    breaks altogether and use a pilcrow instead. Again, I think this was to maintain
    a consistent left margin contra the variable rag.\r\n\r\nMaking the left margin
    more ragged than usual because the right margin is ragged seems exactly what one

    197-206. doi: 10.1037/0022-0663.71.2.197\r\n\r\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\r\nWritten
    sentences often contain several meaningful components (e.g., causes and effects
    or events in a sequence). Preliminary studies of technical documents showed that
    typographically segmenting these components improved raters' judgments of the
    comprehensibility of the information. In the present paper, this segmentation
    notion is generalized, suggesting that phrase segmentation and indentation can
    be used to facilitate comprehension. Five experiments were conducted (with a total
    of 72 college students or technical aides) in which Ss verified sentences by reading
    complex information in several technical passages. Meaningfully segmented and
    indented text resulted in 14\u201328% faster response times than standard text.
    Both segmenting and indenting significantly influenced performance; however, once
    a text had been meaningfully segmented, the addition of indentation cues did not
    significantly affect response time. These data shed light on persisting issues
    in typographic design, namely, whether there is an optimal length for lines and
    whether justified margins are desirable. Such factors appear to be of minor cognitive
    relevance. The critical variable is whether the format results in a display of
    easily encoded units, regardless of length or neatness of margins. (16 ref) (PsycINFO

    into paragraphs by either 1) adding space between paragraphs, OR 2) by using indents.

    one of them. And that makes sense to me. Am I reading that right?
