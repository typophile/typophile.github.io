body: "I am working on a brand for a summer-long church event. The brand theme is
  as follows (in order of importance):\r\n\r\n1. Compliment an Old World themed room
  (Think Tuscany)\r\n2. Contain Palm Trees in the imagery\r\n3. Have a luau feel to
  it\r\n4. Fun, family, summertime\r\n\r\nDon't know if that helps paint a picture
  in your mind, but my issue is finding a typeface to anchor this brand design. Any
  thoughts or suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nBrent"

  body: 'Don''t I know it! I think the tiki fonts are pretty good, but was thinking
    something with a little less of a cliche feel to it because of #1. Maybe just
    a nice clean semi-serif (not Rotis, but something like it) that looks travel-ish.
    Put it with the imagery and that might fit the bill?'

    I had envisioned in my mind. Thankyou all so much! Here's a thought, I just whipped
    this together for discussion purposes. The font would be used in the \"paper\"
    sections in the middle. Any further thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mockup_4633.jpg]"

  body: I like the concept but wish it had a little more color. I think of Hawaii,
    Hawaiian prints, Hawaiian cocktails as pretty lush and colorful.

  body: Thanks to all! the mockup is now done, now I have to make this whole thing
    over in Hi-Res. I really appreciate all your suggestions, they helped a lot. I
    ended up using Celestia Antiqua, they liked that best.

  body: I wouldn't use Hawaiian cocktails for a church event...And I think bright
    colors would clash with the "Tuscan" look. Brent, I really like the color and
    feel of the design you posted.
