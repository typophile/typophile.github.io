  body: "Tracking in text is not regarded as a good practice. When I am in a jam with
    a page make-up problem I may track a para +1 or -1 to make or lose a line. In
    a tricky index I may go as much as +2 or -2. Beyond that the para becomes too
    tight or too loose and these become obvious.\r\n\r\nFor strings of all caps or
    small caps, positive tracking is generally a very good practice, for it reduces
    the color strength of the caps segment of a line. But be careful when tracking
    all caps or small caps, especially when using a large size. Some letter pairs
    may then become too open and you'll have to pull back the spacing in some pairs.
    This is far too often forgotten now that tracking is so easy to do.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, look at books produced by Leonard Baskin at Gehenna Press. He
    set long strings of BEMBO CAPS WITH NO ADJUSTING OF LETTERFITTING AT ALL. Many
    who appreciate fine printing regard Baskin as one of the masters.\r\n\r\nPOWERS"

  body: "Thank you for your comment Will, it was very helpful and informative.\r\n\r\nI
    have slightly tracked a paragraph before as a solution to get rid of widows. Also
    to adjust the spacing between words for large blocks of justified text."

  body: "Sometimes you can use positive tracking on a tightly spaced (particularly
    so) typeface to increase the legibility at text sizes.\r\n\r\nI've used negative
    tracking on typefaces I've found to be spaced too loose for display purposes."

  body: "Eric,\r\n\r\nTracking treatment is used depending on different situation.
    \r\n\r\nIf the text is set ragged right or left. A good compositors like to avoid
    consecutive hyphenated line-ends, but frequent hyphens are better than sloppy
    spacing, and ragged setting is better yet. And tracking is to decrease its stiffness,
    as well as preventing an outbreak of hyphenation. Many san-serif look good when
    set ragged no matter what the length of the measure. Obviously, There is a contradiction
    there, so you need to decide.\r\n\r\nIn other case, when the text is justified,
    the word space become elastic, which always create \"river\". The size of the
    ideal world space depending on factors such as letterfit, type, color, and size.
    A loosely fitted or bold face will need a larger interval between the words. At
    larger sizes, when letterfit is tightened, the spacing of words can be tightened
    as well, For a normal text face in a normal text size, a typical value for the
    word space is a quarter of an em (font size divided by 4).\r\n\r\nLanguage has
    some effect on the word space as well. In highly inflected languages, such as
    Latin, most word boundaries are marked by grammatical tags, and a smaller space
    is therefore sufficient. In English and other uninflected languages, good word
    spacing makes the difference between a line that has to be deciphered and a line
    that can be efficiently read.\r\n\r\nIf the text is justified, a reasonable minimum
    word space is a fifth of an em (M/5), M/4 is a good average to aim for.\r\n\r\nCouple
    more rule\r\n- add little or no space within a string of initials ,ex: Names such
    as W.B.Yeats, or J.C.L. Prillwitz.\r\n\r\n- Letterspace all strings of all caps
    and small caps, and all long string of digits. Such as acronyms. Title and heading,
    adding extra leading is often desirable. And meaningless string like phone number,\r\n\r\n-
    Don't letterspace the lowercase without a reason. If you do, you would steal sheep
    :D\r\n\r\nI just pick out couple word spacing principles explained very well by
    Robert Bringhurst from the book \"The Elements of Typographic Style\". It's good
    to learn the rule first, then breaking that rule (of course, with a reason). There
    are more rules, so in case you don't know it yet, you should get that book.\r\n\r\nHope
    that help. \r\n\r\n"
