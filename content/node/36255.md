body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThis is driving me mad - and after many hours on the internet,
  I need some help! Harper's Bazaar Middle East was launched this year in Dubai, and
  they seem to be using a customised version of the Didot font for headers/sub-heads.
  It's quite elaborate, but amazingly really works. I'm wondering if it was customised
  or if it is available anywhere? \r\n\r\nTake a look at the enclosed,(note the: number
  '4',  S in 'Spring' and the h in 'Fashion')and if any of you recognise it do let
  me know. \r\nOtherwise, I think I'll set about creating my own version...\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nFaye"
