body: "Hi,\r\nwould anyone know of a web resource which gives clear indications for
  combining cedillas and other specialised european characters with non habitual keystroke
  letters like \"t\"s and \"s\"s, for simulating a european character set. I had intended
  to use emigre's Cholla for a book project, when my client announced 10 minutes ago
  that a european character set would be obligatory. Sadly this was not in the project's
  brief. Before abandoning Cholla, I would like to reassure myself that I can't access
  any of the european accents, (etc) that are in the font.\r\n\r\nmany, many thanks,\r\npete\r\n"
