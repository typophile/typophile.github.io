    Rinker]] and if he tends to answer, drop the answer here. But I'd be not surprised
    it's almost everything hand-drawn... Anyway, for /C and /B initials, I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-billhead-1890|Billhead
    LHF]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead|Letterhead]].\r\nFor
    the rest, I'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/sheepman|Sheepman]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/house-of-cards|House of Cards]] and
    customize it. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/gin|Gin]] might
    also be interesting. For a alternative but close design approach to LHF, [[http://decadetypefoundry.bigcartel.com|Decade
    Type Foundry]] is worth of interest.\r\n"

  body: "I agree with Ryuk's suggestion of House of Cards for IGAR OX. If you add
    Tuscan style indents at the top and bottom you are pretty close. Also his good
    finds for B. As for C almost any sans of the right weight and proportion would
    do if you add the Tuscan style ends.\r\nDon"
