<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've just looked at the screenshots from the trailers of "Troy", the upcoming movie by Wolfgang "Das Boot" Petersen. Obviously, the movie is based on Homer's Iliad. There are two trailers ("Teaser" and "Superbowl"), you can look at the screenshots at: <a href=http://grace.elidan.net/troy/ target=_blank>http://grace.elidan.net/troy/</a> <br> <br>The typography of the movie is shameless. They use a "custom version" (if you could use that term) of Trajan. Not only does a movie about ancient Greece use classic Roman type, but also, the modification (horribly extended "R") is simply embarassing. Anything could be better than this bastardized version of Trajan. <br> <br>I guess it's too late to change anything since the movie is due out in May. But tf anybody out there has any contacts with Warner Bros., talk to these people! <br> <br>Adam <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>It does look like a modified Trajan-Bold to me. <br> <br>And the official site throws in Charlemagne and Mason. "Oooh, like old-looking fonts, dude. I love it when like the art people from a movie really know their stuff." <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, <br> <br>but the problem is, it doesn't look like it fits. The extended leg in the R is extremely pretentious, especially when used in every single "R" on the credits or poster. <br> <br>An average person is not able to tell the difference between Arial and Syntax. But this is not a point. When you start being ignorant in details, that ignorance creeps and reaches more and more, until it turns everything into pulp. There are movies where set elements, shoes or costumes miss the epoque by 200 or 400 years. Usually, such stuff aggregates pretty quickly. <br> <br>But it's not only about moviemaking. Think about food: an average person isn't going to know or care if the manufaturer or the cook added genetically enhanced soya, some preservatives. <br> <br>In the "Waldorf Salad" episode of "Fawlty Towers" (my recent favourite), the visiting American, Mr Hamilton talks to Basil Fawlty, the arrogant hotel manager: <br>[Hamilton] What the hell is that? <br>[Fawlty] Vodka and orange juice. <br>[Hamilton] Orange juice? I'm afraid it's not fresh. <br>[Fawlty] Isn't it? <br>[Hamilton] No. <br>[Fawlty] We've just opened the bottle. <br> <br>That's the problem, you know. <br> <br>Adam <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> Does a studio have to pay for type face usage like for art (paintings) in movies? <br> <br>Normally, not. Paintings are art, while typefaces are commercial products. Usually, font licenses do not specify additional royalties for a particular way of use. Also, it is unlikely that licensing models involving royalties would work at all. <br> <br>In case of successful movies, type designers usually profit because movie posters (or popular book covers, for that matter) often make a typeface popular, so it becomes commercially successful. So movie titles are sort of free advertising for a typeface. <br> <br>Adam <br></div>
