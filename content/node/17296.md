  MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan foundry of Philadelphia was a direct descendant of [[Binny
  and Ronaldson]], one of the first American type foundries. It was formed in 1860
  when [[Lawrence Johnson]], who had taken over the Ronaldson foundry, passed away
  and the firm was taken over by his partners, [[Thomas MacKellar]], [[John and Richard
  Smith]], and [[Peter Jordan]]. In 1855 the firm began publishing the [[Typographic
  Advisor]], the first publication devoted to printing and typography in the U.S.
  In 1892 the company became part of the [[American Type Founders]] or ATF combine."
