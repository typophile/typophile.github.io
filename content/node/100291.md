  It is very useful.\r\n\r\nI research what is this font ?\r\nI join 4 pictures. I
  have others pictures if necessary.\r\n\r\nLook at the letter \"a\", I love it. And
  the letter \"t\".\r\n\r\nBut I don't know what is this font ?\r\n\r\nI would like
  to use it for a website.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\nEric"

    I remember headlines and main logo were set in Sansumi.\r\nFor the rest, I don't
    use WTF anymore but still post on WTF forum. WTF is not accurate at all to me.
