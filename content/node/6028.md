  body: I think BJ&#39;s right about the Goverment-issue lettering. I think a lot
    of the signage was done in the 30&#39;s &#40;long before digital fonts&#41;, as
    part of the Depression-era Public Works projects.  <BR> <BR>That means finding
    a font that matches this exactly would depend on someone digitizing it, or the
    typeface it was based on. Not sure if either of those things happened, but one
    of the heavier weights of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-nobel/"
    target="_blank">Font Bureau&#39;s Nobel</a> is a reasonably close approximation,
    I think.

  body: There&#39;s an article in @issue &#40;Corporate Design Foundation magazine&#41;
    about this. The font is adapted from Michael Schwab&#39;s hand-drawn alphabet.
    He also did a great series of posters for the park service. I&#39;m trying to
    find more about it... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.michaelschwab.com" target="_blank">http://www.michaelschwab.com</a>

  body: All I can offer to that is that Vignelli&#39;s designs were for the National
    Park Service, where Schwab&#39;s designs &#40;in coordination with Rich Silverstein&#41;
    were for the Golden Gate National Parks Association. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always
    admired Vignelli&#39;s work--Those materials have been updated slightly &#40;including
    an original typeface--Rawlinson--by James Montalbano&#41;. <BR> <BR>-Addison
