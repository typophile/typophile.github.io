  area...\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone can help me? As part of a Graphic Art project
  I have designed a Display Font in Illustrator and ported it into Fontlab. As it's
  a monospaced font the kerning is all so has thus been relatively easy to put together...\r\n\r\nOne
  thing I was wondering though, is it possible to have multiple versions of the same
  Glyph in one font set? so basically you can pick an alternate Glyph... it's just
  some of the letters I couldn't make my mind up on...\r\n\r\nany help at all is greatly
  appreciated \r\n\r\nKieran"
