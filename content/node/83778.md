  please help me identify this font? I know or at least am pretty sure that it is
  an Art Deco style font, but I could be wrong. I cannot seem to find it anywhere.
  I have searched all the font finder programs out there and I find little elements,
  such as the low arm on the E, R, and A of letters from other fonts, but nothing
  where all of these are together and look they way they do in the image \r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  the only example I have is the attached image.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! :D\r\n\r\n~Jedi"
