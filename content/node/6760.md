body: There is someone looking for a tool, similar to a pizza cutter mixed with a
  stamp, that Stravinsky apparently developed when he wanted to print &#40;stamp&#41;
  his own paper for music composition.  <BR> <BR>A&#41; Does anyone know of this device?
  <BR>B&#41; Does anyone know of where to find more information?

  body: The &#34;someone&#34; is my brother, who studied Jazz Composition at Berklee.
    He read about it in &#34;Conversations with Stravinsky&#34; by Robert Craft. Apparently
    he used it as a device to take &#34;musical notes&#34; of sorts. In other words
    he wasn&#39;t forced to use specific sizes of paper and could &#34;print&#34;
    onto anything.

  body: geraint. thanks. i didn&#39;t mean graph paper, i just couldn&#39;t think
    of the term for &#34;the paper used by composers&#34;. your drawing is exactly
    what my brother described. he realizes that he could probably go to the local
    crafty corner and get a wheel stamp but he is more interested in stravinsky&#39;s
    idea.

  body: This is Renny speaking - Tiffany&#39;s brother....Geraint......that is exactly
    what I imagined the device to be like.  I don&#39;t think it was made clear in
    the book whether the device had merely one staff or was capable of producing both
    a treble and bass cleff or any other configuration of 2 staves. With a single
    staff only....it is quite possible that it would still be wavy like the exerpt
    you posted.....but alas....where to purchase such a device........

  body: First, design in Illy or PS how you want one complete rotation to look, then
    take it to a custom rubber stamp maker and tell them you want the rubber wrapped
    around a wooden disk/dowel/circle, then attach a handle.

  body: If buying staff paper is out of the question, How about just drawing staff
    paper lines and printing sheets on a laser printer?  Is this too hi-tech or is
    there some philisophical reason?

  body: I have a feeling my brother is after the whole &#34;feel&#34; of it. He has
    composition paper. Like any artist, I think he&#39;s interested in other composer&#39;s
    techniques.

  body: Renato Here again&#40;Tiffany&#39;s Brother&#41; - John B. - excellent idea....I
    have actually come to a similar conclusion myself...so it&#39;s off to a tacky
    stamp store..... <BR> <BR>Also,,,,,Geraint you have a good point. as far as big
    band music goes...I have written many big band scores....and arranged many works
    by the so-called &#34;core&#34; of famous jazz composers....Ellington, Mingus,
    Monk, Coltrane, Evans, Strayhorn, and list could go on forever....but I also write
    alot of species counterpoint as a perpetual student of the perfection of Bach.
    However - the main reason for this idea is more of a compositional process that
    Robert Craft&#39;s book inspired when he went on to describe the methods Stravinsky
    had come to employ in the later serial phase of his life&#40;serial meaning he
    had left his neo-classical period and embraced&#40;albeit in his own inimitable
    way&#41;the philosophy of the second viennese school&#40;namely Schoenberg and
    his 2 disciples Alban Berg and my favourite - Anton von Webern&#41;....at this
    point in time Stravinsky began to employ a method of composition involving blank
    paper that he could write ideas on and merely put staves whereever he neede to
    accompany ideas....a rather organic process...which appeals to me.....Chris....yeah
    i have loads of staff paper...i have even created several documents of custom
    staff paper in illy.....however it is more a question of trying to create a more
    organic process...plus lots of staff paper is printed on low quality paper that
    evaporates under the eraser of my obssesive/compulsive editing.....thanks for
    the ideas and tips....

  body: Renato, <BR>My daughter is a music composition major at Carnegie Mellon University.
    For a few years she was totally imersed in Shastakovich but now she is in Mahler
    heaven.  She gets very obsesive when it comes to her composers.  Is this the norm
    for composers? BTW, do you compose at the piano or just write on paper?  We have
    a lovely 1928 Steinway grand in our house but my daughter composes while in her
    bed just scribbling notes a mile-a-minute with a pencil. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: I once carried the music staff to a free-ish form. A few years ago I was asked
    to design a CD cover and some promotional material for a jazz musician.  The name
    of the album was &#34;Uncertain Times.&#34;  I developed a logo-like image using
    a staff drawn in a circle to resemble a stop watch with no hands and key signatures
    instead of the usual numbers for hours. Attached is the logo and a picture of
    the disk itself. <BR> <BR>ChrisL <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/49460.gif"

  body: Or get one of those very fat felt-tipped poster pens and carve  <BR>out 5
    notches with an exacto knife. <BR> <BR>Or get a watercolor chisel brush of the
    right width. Snip snip  <BR>until it looks like a comb. Might be too wavy. <BR>
    <BR>The spirit of Stavinsky is not buying such a device, but crafting it.
