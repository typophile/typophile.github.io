    so want to make some suggestions: <BR> <BR>1 &#62; The the capitals and figures
    have more impact than lowercase letters. <BR>2 &#62; The c/l and l/c &#40; Ss
    &#41; the spine are too contrast that the others letters, like the caracthers
    &#40; MNQZz &#41;. <BR>3 &#62; The letter l/c &#40; a &#41; is little too condensed
    that the others I think. <BR> <BR>But I think you are going in the right way,
    the work have very good apperence! <BR>Do you have more letters to show? <BR>Regards

  body: ' Darren, <BR> <BR>Welcome to the forum, and thanks for participating!  At
    risk of repeating Ricardo&#39;s critique, it appears that the face &#40;at least
    at this magnification&#41; has varying stroke weights within the letters. This
    creates dark spots in letters like the S. I will make this request, howver- can
    you set some words and/or phrases in the face? Sometimes it helps to see the overall
    color and rhythm of the face to effectively critique it. And oftimes, variation
    and nuance within the face itself can really bring the type to life. '

  body: ' Darren, <BR> <BR>This has the potential to be a great and highly versatile
    typeface. Ironically, it reminded me of Erik Spiekermann&#39;s faces &#40;Officina,
    Meta&#41;, but I too can see the similarities with Hubert Jocham&#39;s faces now
    that the resemblances have been pointed out. <BR> <BR>I would echo all of the
    suggestions so far, and add a couple of my own: <BR> <BR>1. As Ricardo mentioned
    about the lc &#34;a&#34; being a bit condensed, you may want to look at all of
    the letters&#39; widths in relation to one another. The proportions seem slightly
    off &#40;lc &#34;v&#34;, &#34;w&#34; and uc &#34;V&#34; seem a bit wide, while
    lc &#34;a&#34;, &#34;k&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, &#34;n&#34;, &#34;u&#34;, &#34;y&#34;,
    uc &#34;J&#34;, &#34;K&#34;, &#34;M&#34;, &#34;P&#34;, &#34;R&#34; and &#34;W&#34;
    seem narrow&#41;. <BR> <BR>2. You may want to try bringing the vertex of the lc
    &#34;y&#34; down closer to or slightly below the baseline. This may help balance
    the body with the tail, and also may help balance its width with the other characters.
    OR, as an alternative to this, try widening the angles of the two strokes just
    a bit. Or maybe a little of both. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>3. I agree that the lower case set seems lighter than the
    upper case and figures sets. I like the look of the weight of the upper case and
    figures, so I would suggest making the lower case slightly heavier. <BR> <BR>I
    really like the design of the lc &#34;a&#34;. And I find the differing terminal
    cuts on the uc &#34;K&#34; and lc &#34;k&#34; to be really interesting. It would
    be interesting to see you apply the same terminals to some other characters, such
    as uc &#34;R&#34;, uc &#34;X&#34; and lc &#34;x&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking
    forward to seeing this face evolve. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' I think your lc is looking great, except: <BR>1. The &#34;k&#34;&#39;s upper
    arm is/seems too long. <BR>2. The &#34;m&#34;&#39;s counters seem unequal. <BR>3.
    The &#34;w&#34; is too wide. I know it&#39;s tempting to make it two &#34;v&#34;s
    &#40;I&#39;ve done that myself&#41;, but it&#39;s better to make the strokes less
    inclined; you might also consider stopping the middle part before it reaches the
    x-height - it helps readability. <BR> <BR>For your UC, I like most of the forms
    individually, but I think you have an important -and equally challenging- decision
    to make: do you want all the caps to approximately converge in width &#40;the
    &#34;contemporary&#34; approach&#41;, or do you want them to diverge &#40;like
    in &#34;old style&#34; fonts&#41;? The latter I myself prefer, even in designs
    like this, not least because it makes all-caps setting much less unreadable. Right
    now it seems your caps are somewhere in between the two approaches, and I think
    that&#39;s a problem. Also: there&#39;s still some color imbalance, although a
    GIF is a terrible place to judge that - you really have to go lino before you
    can be confident of the color &#40;especially as mass text&#41;. <BR> <BR>Numerals:
    very nice, except for the joins of the &#34;6&#34; and &#34;9&#34; being tucked
    in too much - note how nice and open your &#34;8&#34; is. Your &#34;7&#34; is
    killer. I might make the zero rounder. <BR> <BR>Accents: they seem unfinished,
    at least in terms of placement. I&#39;d just say that your ring might be a little
    too light, and you could raise the umlauts a bit, esp in the lc. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    make the &#34;ae&#34; one glyph: flatten the top of the &#34;a&#34;&#39;s bowl
    to unite the strokes; get rid of the &#34;a&#34;&#39;s stem at the baseline. The
    slashes on your &#34;O&#34;/&#34;o&#34;/cent are too steep. The Yen&#39;s top
    bar is clotting. The dollar looks unbalanced - but to be honest I actually like
    to encourage ugly dollarsigns. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    the lc &#39;k&#39; and &#39;m&#39; today and thought the same. I didn&#39;t see
    the w being too wide though, but I shall revisit it and make amendments - the
    point about the middle part being lowered I understand and will investigate. <BR>
    <BR>The UC does have a problem with its proportions which I think comes from me
    being a total &#40;but hungry&#41; novice. The colour imbalance is again a problem
    which I feel stems from both my &#39;beginner&#39; approach and my relative inexperience
    with the software - they looked fine on paper! I do need to make a decision as
    to their proportions. <BR> <BR>The numerals are a first draft and the &#39;6&#39;
    and &#39;9&#39; do need opening up I agree. Thanks for the positive comments -
    I was a little nervous as the previous lining numerals were awful, and I wasn&#39;t
    totally sure about these ones - although I felt they were a lot better than their
    predecessors. This is pretty much the first time they have all been put together

    and do need some tweaking. The &#39;ring&#39; does need some weight adding to
    it.  <BR> <BR>The &#39;ae&#39; glyph has gone a little crazy - I just looked at
    the paper based drawing and on that I had removed the a&#39;s stem - quality control
    a little lax there! The comments about the other characters I will take on board

    the decision of which way to go for a given design &#40;converge the widths or

    as long as the designer knows what functionality he&#39;s sacrificing for some

    when one has to first dismiss a bunch of traditional but laughable theories -
    like the one that says they help guide the eye like train tracks... gimme a break,
    linespacing already does that 100 times better, thank you very much&#41;, but
    I see it as two-pronged: <BR> <BR>1. Serifs help distinguish one glyph from another
    &#40;to varying extents&#41;. <BR> <BR>2. Serifs help glyphs coalesce into boumas
    &#40;word shapes&#41;, instead of standing out individually. Kind of like why
    tight spacing helps readability, noting that if you space a sans too tightly the
    counters overpower the inter-letter spacing &#40;ruining the distribution of color
    in a bouma&#41;, while in a serif face the serifs start touching &#40;facilitating
    the coalesce thing&#41; before that happens/needs_to_happen. <BR> <BR>This is
    in addition to the familiarity factor &#40;which some people however over-rate&#41;.
