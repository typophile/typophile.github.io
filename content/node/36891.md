  body: "To me, it\u2019s not as \uFFFC<cite>terrible</cite> as to <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/36352?page=2\">others</a>.
    Still, it may feel a little bit uninspired and clumsy. Alternatives? I like <a
    href=\"http://www.linotype.com/387/excelsior-family.html\">Excelsior</a> a lot.
    Quite robust newspaper face, actually. And have a look what <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/georgia/morelikethis.html\">MyFonts</a>
    suggests \u2026 there are some fresh beauties among them."

    Georgia does a good job, if you laser-print directly from a website \u2013 my
    opinion. "

  body: "Miller by Matthew Carter, the designer of Georgia, has created to the most
    lovely scotch ever!\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Miller\r\n\r\nThen there
    is Vincent also by Matthew Carter- you have to ask Carter and Cone directly about
    pricing.\r\nwww.carterandcone.com\r\n\r\nThe new Chronicle is a very honed interpretation,
    although in my opinion not as pretty.\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032\r\n\r\nLorena
    by Eduardo Manso will be coming out soon and it looks like it fits within the
    genre.\r\nhttp://www.emtype.net/proceso_5.html\r\n\r\nAlso Scotch FB\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ScotchFB"

    But, would it be profitable, what do you think?\r\n\r\nPS \r\nOr a Verdana-FinePrint
    with OSF and all that stuff \u2013 Verdana25ultralight.otf, hehe"
