  that can help.\r\n\r\nIn CS3, if you are using a document dictionary and add a word,
  the new hyphenation points are honored--unless that word is preceded by a closed-up
  emdash, in which case, hyphenation reverts to the hyphenation in the proximity dictionary.
  This behavior holds true for hyphens, en-dashes, and emdashes, whenever the the
  character preceding the dash/hyphen is not a space--or perhaps not one ID takes
  as a word boundary.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you add\r\n\r\npart~ic~ular \r\n\r\nand
  \r\n\r\nhyph~enat~ion\r\n\r\nto the user dictionary, the single words are hyphenated
  according to the new break points, but\r\n\r\nbut both \r\n\r\nparicular-hyphenation,
  \r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nparticular--hyphenation\r\n\r\nrevert to the proximity dictionary
  break points.\r\n\r\nFor the compound words, you can add them to the dictionary
  treating the hyphen ac a character, and it works. e.g.\r\n\r\npar~~ic~~ular-~hyph~~enat~~ion\r\n\r\nbut
  that is a lot of work, and em-dashes can occur with just about any  words, and in
  any proof stage.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions appreciated,\r\n\r\nCharles \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Insert a miniscule space, perhaps? The hair space, for example. You can also
    try the non-joiner character (if I remember correctly). But chances are you can't
    do that on either side of the hyphen, because it might lead to the hyphen ending
    up on the wrong side if it's used in a line break. And, logically (following Adobe's
    logic), \"particular-\" is not the same word as \"particular\", so that would
    only halve the problem.\r\n\r\nOne would expect a hyphenated compound to honour
    the hyphenation of its compounds; I can't think of a reason why <em>not</em>.\r\n\r\nBy
    the by, are these two words just random examples? It seems to me they should get
    hyphenated OK. (Which doesn't circumvent the actual problem, tho'.)"

  body: "I think I can explain what's happening and why and what we hope to do about
    it...\r\n1) First of all, this behavior has been reproduced and a bug report has
    been written against the next version of InDesign.\r\n2) This bug was introduced
    either in CS2 or CS3 to fix an bug with some languages (Czech, Polish, maybe others).
    The original behavior was always to send the words on either side of a dash to
    the hyphenation system separately (which addresses your issue). However, when
    Czech words that already contain a hyphen are hyphenated the hyphen character
    appears at the end of one line and the beginning of the next. So, it was necessary
    to send words containing hyphens to the dictionary intact.  The bug is that we
    didn't differentiate between the hyphen and dashes.\r\n3) We do strip punctuation
    off before looking up words in the dictionary, so <em>particular</em> and <em>particular-</em>
    should be treated the same way.\r\n4) The non-joiner isn't a breaking character,
    but the discretionary line break (or zero-width space, u+200B) is. "

    looking up words in the dictionary, so particular and particular- should be treated
    the same way.</cite>\r\n\r\nisn't quite what happens, though. Below a test snippit
    w/ CS3. As you can see, both the word before and after reverts with either an
    em-dash or a standard hyphen. (The lines at the top just show what I added to
    the dictionary, we all know that isn't the place you enter them!) [img:sites/default/files/old-images/hyp2_5326.gif]\r\n\r\nWhat
    we really want to do is completely replace the hyphenation dictionary that comes
    with InDesign, but that doesn't seem possible. You can put in all the words from
    a book, hyphenated as you want, but under certain situations, InDesign seems to
    revert to the Proximity dictionary no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe reason for all this
    is we set books, and by in large need to follow the Chicago Manual of Style. Two
    cases from the Chicago Manual should make the point, single vowels should stay
    up & never be taken down (section 6.45, 15th edition); and compounds words need
    to be treated gingerly--see section 6.50.\r\n\r\nThe other reason for making a
    dictionary for each title is that various languages are almost never tagged in
    author-supplied files. What we have done for years is to make up a dictionary
    for each book, and if Russian & English, Spanish & English--or whatever--occur
    in the text, all the words can live in a single dictionary specific for that book.\r\n\r\nSo,
    is there a way to completely replace the dictionary?"

  body: Charles, your screenshot shows that one of the words added was <strong>hype~enat~ion</strong>.
    Is that a typo, or the word added was really that one?
