  would have connections to a dinosaur such as a Linotype machine, it'd be this one.
  <!--break-->\r\n\r\nI guess I should introduce myself first (and hopefully not come
  off as <em>too</em> bad of a newbie.) My name's Eston, and I'm a student at the
  University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \r\n\r\nI'm currently taking a journalism class
  at the University, and my old-school professor is really fond of the Linotype and
  the whole hot type era, as it was just fading away as he started his career as a
  reporter. He's starting a website (that I'm helping him get off the ground,) and
  I'd love to get a Linotype slug custom-made for him as a sort of nostalgic gift.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is that these machines are near-impossible to find, let alone in a working
  form. Do any of you have (or know anyone that has) a <em>working</em> Linotype machine
  that may be able to cast a slug for my professor? I'd be willing to pay for one.\r\n\r\nThanks.
  Sorry this isn't a wonderful first post, but I'll definitely be sticking around.
  Now, where is my Bringhurst book... I think I should read that before I say much
  more. :)"

    and availability, I need to know exactly what words you want, in which point size,
    and in what typeface (not that the exact font would necessarily be available\u2026)"

      in 18 point Cheltenham. If that's not possible, I'll always settle for the standby
      Helvetica 55 Roman.\r\n\r\nThanks Dan."
