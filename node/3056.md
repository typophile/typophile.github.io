body: I am working on a logo for Evergreen Farm. Basically they buy horses, train
  them, and sell them. They want a logo for their website, signage, etc. It is still
  in black and white and line form. I will probably add something to the bar on the
  E &#40;because it feels bare&#41;. <BR> <BR>I am using Runic MT for the font, and
  Caslon 540 for the secondary font. I chose Runic because I feel it is sharp and
  classy. I was looking at Layfeyette &#40;Font Bureau&#41; and Acolyte &#40;Altered
  Ego&#41; as possibilities, but I don&#39;t own either. Before I make a purchase
  I want to hear opinions on the font choice.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26136.gif"

    and gold as colors possibly? <BR>

    but maybe show us some others?  It doesn&#39;t feel exactly right.

  body: I might use forest green / evergreen and gold, but I am always against doing
    the obvious. This might be a case where it wouldn&#39;t be bad to use a color
    that is in the name. I hope to post progress tomorrow.

    it as the best choice because it seems so.

  body: Put the cross bar back and have the horses leg going over it like a jump.
    That would reinforce the training aspect. Just my two cents

  body: I, too, think it needs the cross bar. Right now, I don&#39;t see an &#39;E&#39;.
    Otherwise, I think it&#39;s quite nice. &#39;Farm&#39; might be a bit too small
    in comparison to Evergreen when reproduced at small sizes.

  body: This image is at 350 pixels. I can&#39;t imagine it needing to go any smaller.
    some lines at 350 definitely get lost but I don&#39;t think it hurts it too bad.

    <BR> <BR>Someone suggested when I started that I add a bar. I believe that adding
    any sort of bar hurts the cleanness of the overall image and adds confusion. Unless
    a second bar is added perpendicular to the horizontal bar, the bar is floating.
    If a vertical and horizontal bar is added it is alot of straight lines to take
    away from the &#34;E&#34;. In a way, I was hoping it almost looks like the horse
    is jumping over the bottom beak &#40;of the E&#41;. That may be a stretch considering
    he is so far from it. It may be the right thing to add a jumping bar. I will toy
    with it and see if I can&#39;t make it work. <BR> <BR>When I straighten the leg
    anymore than it is it takes away from the momentum of the horse jumping. Most
    associate that pose with the horse jumping. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26210.gif"

    <BR> <BR>Also, I adjusted the shadow on the leg so it could adapt better when
    the logo is smaller. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26212.gif"

  body: The thin lines will get you not when they disappear, but then they <i>clot
    together</i>. You&#39;ll need a lo-fi version. <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t add the
    middle bar - I think it&#39;s enough of an &#34;E&#34;. <BR> <BR>Do remove the
    trapping from the Runic &#40;like in the armpits of the &#34;N&#34;&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t think the &#34;FARM&#34; font is working with the Runic. Try something
    like Bank, or Blair, and at a darker weight. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I have adjusted the logo so it can go smaller by adding more white space inside
    the outer edge and simplified the shading. I also changed the font for &#34;farm&#34;
    and adjusted the traps in &#34;evergreen&#34;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26251.gif"

  body: Tom, try moving the horse up and making it smaller, extend its leg and have
    it over lap the cross bar of the E covering most of it up. These are just suggestions
    for you to look at, maybe you already have.

  body: Here is the logo with some color. I am still playing with it. I decided to
    not try and make the horse leg more obvious that it is the bar on the &#34;E&#34;.
    Because the type will always be with it people getting the association doesn&#39;t
    make or break the logo. I usually don&#39;t like things to be obvious anyways.

    that means virtually nothing &#40;and I don&#39;t have a Pantone book&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>In the lo-fi version do try to keep that nice parallel between the mane and
    the spikes in the stem - probably just by making them fewer and larger. You might
    also make the whole thing a bit wider. <BR> <BR>BTW, I just looked at the spacing
    for real: your &#34;EVE&#34; needs to be closed up a hair. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>I agree <BR> <BR>Here is the logo with more color kick. After I posted
    I realized how desaturated it was. I am using Pantone 371 for the green and 1205
    for the light gold. Also, is the spacing better  between the EVE? <BR> <BR><img
