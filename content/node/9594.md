    <i>2 minutes!</i>, foiling Stephen in the process. Congrats! <BR> <BR>Say Timothy,
    what do you mean by <i>&#34;what&#39;s worse is i thought i disliked this typeface.&#34;</i>?
    I dislike Times New Roman as well and I feel perfectly fine about that. Overuse
    kills even the best faces, and the times I&#39;ve seen it used well are very rare
    indeed.

  body: Ah, that sweet blinking e-mail icon. The delightful rush of adrenalin when
    trying to identify those anonimous characters. The furious scramble to type and
    link and post and beat everyone else to it. The satisfaction when your post shows
    up mere seconds before someone else&#39;s. &#40;sigh&#41; Isn&#39;t life wonderful?
    <BR> <BR>P.S. Which doesn&#39;t mean we all procrastiwhatthehell&#39;sthatword?
    I just drop everything I&#39;m at when I get the notification, and I get back
    to work afterwards. ;p

  body: Yves... Here I am putting Times up for indentification which is embarrassing
    enough. The same Times which I always thought I hated and associated with University
    paper&#39;s I&#39;m now claiming to like. The problem is I never looked at it
    close enough to make a proper judgement in the first place and being prejudice
    of anything, even type, is close-minded. <BR> <BR>By the way, the cd in which
    I like the use of Times is Biosphere&#39;s Substrata | Man With A Movie Camera,
    designed by Jon Wozencrof.
