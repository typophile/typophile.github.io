    just be a gimmick.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since this is about a font (right?)
    I have to ask: how is the Cyrillic influencing the Latin? To me it seems one-sided,
    even if I take into account that Cyrillic came from the same place (Greek) and
    was furthermore Westernized by Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The gimmick is that the common glyphs are double-height, which is a clever
    design idea that draws attention to itself but makes reading either of the scripts
    \uFB02uently more dif\uFB01cult than if they were each the same height, one on
    top of the other.\r\n\r\nIs there an alternate version with Cyrillic on top?"
