body: "Beyond its use as a tool, has the computer affected type design?\r\n\r\nIn
  the process of researching a paper on the New Typography and its claims of correspondence
  to the world, i've been struck by the importance of photography to the movement.
  Not only have i run into accounts of design history that basically disregard anything
  that happened between Gutenberg and Ni\xE9pce/Daguerre as unimportant, but photography
  is identified as a perfect match for the New Typography given its objectivity, clarity,
  and lack of individualism. Whether these characteristics are applicable, it's clear
  that the ways in which photography affected worldviews in the late 19th and early
  20th centuries had an effect on this particular theory of type design.\r\n\r\nIt's
  got me wondering what sorts of effects computers have had upon type design. Not
  being a designer myself, i'm curious if folks have an opinion on this. Particularly
  if there are characteristics of the computer (such as its reliance on numbers and
  patterns, its use in networks, its close ties to scientificity...) that have had
  an effect on (your or other) design in recent decades. "

    computer has had an effect on type; of course as a tool for design the computer
    has had an effect (water is indeed wet). What i'm getting at is a question about
    the philosophies of design in practice today. Does the computer as a cultural/social/scientific/...
    phenomenon affect the ways in which designers approach design at a conceptual
    level. Does it affect ideas concerning what typography is for; what a good design
    is; what the relation between form and function ought to be? And if so, what sorts
    of effects has it had?\r\n\r\nJames, thanks for the recommendation. \r\n\r\nChristopher,

    huge. Really broad questions are hard to answer well. \r\n\r\nAlso nobody has
    time to write your paper for you. \r\n\r\nAlso I think that you will find that
    any kind of broad brush aesthetic relationship that you might theorize will be
    shot to pieces by the reality. The impact of on type/printing has not been to
    advantage one aesthetic as might be imagined but on specific technical aspects,
    the cultural, jobs, roles, etc and will require looking at printed things talking
    to people and observing things from there. Some things to begin looking at are
    font availability, methods of printing, printing costs, availability of letter
    making tools and well - that is maybe enough for now.\r\n\r\nMy advice is read
    and think more, maybe ask some older folks what happened to them and return with
    much much narrower questions."

    continuing that thought, I've come to realize that the defining characteristic
    of a career in design is not the work one does, but dealing with tools that change
    constantly, designers being always at the mercy of technological progress. No
    doubt it's true that for many professions one needs to be up to date with the

    design. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a new font, it would take a long time to be able to test it, let alone see how
    it would look in different sizes. And after the font was ready, if someone was
    willing to publish it, it would take a titanic amount of work (and costs!) to
    make it available for use.\r\n\r\nToday you can design everything by yourself,
    test it quickly in a lot of different ways, and make it available for the entire
    world in the blink of an eye - without having to cast tons of metal to make your
    font usable.\r\n\r\nThis faster and cheaper way of working with type design allows
    much more experimentation, and what we see today is that instead of just slightly
    redesigning a previously available font, type designers are free to create whatever
    they want and see how it comes out.\r\n\r\nBy the other hand, this is misleading
    people to think that all you need to design a font is a Mac and some spare time...
    no need to study or read anything... :|"

    that is meant as a personal, psychological statement -- what motivates a type
    designer -- then no quibble. \r\n\r\nIf not, the point I was trying, and obviously
    failed, to make was that if we chose, we could reintroduce *most* of the effects
    of the hot metal composition with computer type. Just a couple of instances --
    a randomization program could be used to introduce slight variations in letters,
    mimicking the variation from casting individual letters in a mould.\r\n\r\nInk
    spread could be compensated for. And on & on. Given that, the question could be
    asked: Do we not do this because the original \"look\" was itself an an aberration?
    Or if it was desirable, it must not have been so desirable as to be worth all
    the work to replicate it.\r\n\r\nYou can argue that some of look of metal type
    was an aberration, occasioned by the technology,  \r\nbut an equal answer is that
    many of those \"aberrations\" could have been banished with the technology of
    the time; they were not because the cost, both in type machines and time, couldn't
    be commercially justified. And it was that commercial considerations that brought
    about that technology to start with, not aesthetic ones. \r\n\r\nThe technological
    change (now to computers) may have occasioned designers to move in different directions,
    but they could have moved that way anyway, albeit at a much higher cost.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    I believe tooling from a market perspective is essentially an historical, not
    aesthetic matter. Except, as always, for personal motivation.\r\n"

    \r\nIf I may reiterate a point I made over on the Legato thread, I still think
    that tools influence thinking, not just production specifics. Ideas are born in
    friction, and dialogue, with tools and materials. Or grossly oversimplified, tools
    \u2014which of course aren't born out of a vacuum, but out of a desire too\u2014

    \r\n\r\nI'm struck by the apparent inseparability of the tool and at least some
    aspect of the product. \r\nIn ancient Greek the word 'techne' refered to both
    art and craft (not in the William Morris sense), to any kind of making that had
    an end product. Through a series of translations the two were separated, and for
    some art stands in opposition to technology with all its negative connotations.
    I'm thinking type is one of those places where art and technology are still joined
    -- where something like utility and something like beauty are both present in
    the production and in the product itself.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, i'd add that the relation
    between letter form and technology has been of interest to philosophers as well."
