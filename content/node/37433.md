body: "A current project involves a geometric, fairly black poster face. When printing
  waterfall specimens, it seems that the overshoot becomes increasingly inadequate
  at larger sizes. When I get it too look right at 1-2 inch height, it then looks
  over-overshot at .33 -.75 sizes.  Is this just a nature of typefaces intended for
  larger sizes? Does weight play a factor I hadn't anticipated? I'm curious to hear
  what others have observed. If anyone here has developed different optical sizes,
  did they overshoot them each uniquely? How?\r\n\r\nOddly, the overshoot, or lack
  of, seems to matter least, at .25 inch and smaller. This only seems to be true on
  paper, so it may be a printing artifact.  Due to the geometric nature, I expected
  this to be truer at larger sizes, not the reverse."

    bottom O. You are trying to ballance the perceived mass and distance of that mass
    from neighboring glyphs. It may be more an issue of font metricks. Try your problematic
    sizes with tighter and looser sidebearings and see what happens. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: There is indeed a purely circular arc on the O (and such). At this point the
    sidebearings are equal to the counter width. I hadn't considered mass vs. distance.
    I know we are referring to a perceived "mass", but I wonder if it isn't just like
    physical engineering where linear dimensions and mass don't scale together. If
    so, there may be no solution for  under and over 1" usage? I will experiment with
    it a bit to see how metrics alter things.

  body: "Think of mass having gravitation in the opposite direction. The large mass
    of straight sided glyphs like H repells and needs more sidebearing. The small
    mass of circular O sides needs less sidebearing. It is kinda' like balancing a
    heavy weight on a teeter board with a light weight by extending the fulcrun of
    the small wiegt to ballance.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Choz, it is a ying and yang thing to me. I just go back and forth with a
    few key glyphs in a test word until the thing binds itself together. There is
    nothing absolute enough about type design for me to be able to set up a step-by-step
    procedure. Everything stays plastic and nothing is imune from change until it
    lets you know by seeing. Of course, that may be why I never get anything finished
