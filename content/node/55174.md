  it if you all don't mind.\r\n\r\nThe link to it in my portfolio is http://www.glennsorrentino.com/graphicdesign/view/Sure_Building_Web_Design_Branding/page:1\r\n\r\nIf
  you click the image a lightbox will come up and you can scroll through the secondary
  and tertiary pages.\r\n\r\nThanks all!"

  body: "Hi Glenn..!!\r\n:D\r\n\r\nI really like your website look.. Have a very nice
    balance between your font choice, the bg textures, photos and colors\r\n\r\nI
    just have a little technical troubles:\r\n1. when I click a thumbnail for display
    a gallery.. I can't escape until arrive to end of current sequence, well.. this
    is hard to explain, but in general, it's not so critical.\r\n2. Your divs overlap
    on this navigator sistem (explorer), I mean, the top bar leave covering your galleries
    and your contact fields... may be is a explorer trouble.. but I think this could
    be solve for any brower.\r\n\r\nhope this comment be a little useful for any.\r\nand
    well.. have a nice day, regards =)\r\nPeGGO"

  body: "@peggo Thanks :) But I was actually talking about the first piece in the
    portfolio. Sure Building's website. \r\n\r\nIE gives a lot of problems. Which
    version are you using?\r\n\r\nwww.glennsorrentino.com"

  body: "Glenn,\r\n\r\nLooks good and clean overall. Feels very heavy with photography
    with the large background images and the call out window images. Maybe you could
    take the opacity of the background down all together. \r\n\r\nOther than that
    it would just be a matter of the UI and functionality. Good work. Keep it up.\r\n\r\n"
