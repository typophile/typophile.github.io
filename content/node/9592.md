  body: I am stumped. I&#39;ve looked through the Script Guide and about 4 books.
    <BR> <BR>Are these all the letters you have? It would be nice to see some repeating
    letters, to make sure this is not hand-lettered.

  body: I forgot you said &#39;Rubber Stamp&#39; -- so this is the entire stamp?  If
    so, I don&#39;t think we will be able to tell you much. It could have been made
    from hand lettering, and we&#39;d never know. The fact that it doesn&#39;t match
    anything I can find anywhere, in my library &#40;so far&#41;, makes me lean that
    way. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep looking for a while, and see if anyone else has any
    ideas.

  body: I found it. It&#39;s called Bravo. I will scan the sample from Dan Solo&#39;s
    &#39;Bold Script Alphabets&#39; book.

  body: Here is the scan. I also was able to find it in Jaspert, and it was designed
    for Haas in 1945 by E. A Neukomm. Don&#39;t know if has been digitized. <BR><img

  body: Looks like <a href="http://www.linotype.com/10-10-10-14026/1973.html" target="_blank">Linotype
    </a> owns the design now, but it has not apparently been digitized.

  body: Rick Mueller digitized Bravo over a decade ago. Click on <BR>The 2005 Update
    on the left <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/mueller/index.htm"
    target="_blank"> here</a>. Almost all of Mueller&#39;s <BR>fonts were the first
    digital versions of old typefaces which <BR>may be found in the Solotype Catalog.

    now on my computer the font of my old &#34;Pierre Christinat&#34; rubber stamp.
    <BR> <BR>I can say &#34;Bravo&#34; and thank you very much ! <BR> <BR>Pierre

  body: Patricia - Rick Mueller digitized those fonts originally &#40;like everyone
    <BR>else back then&#41; on and for the Mac. A few may be found <a href="http://www.erik.co.uk/font/"
    target="_blank"> here</a>, <BR> mainly in the Arty category. <BR> <BR>Note, however,
    that the contact info in those ReadMes, as well as <BR>the info on the TypOasis
    site, is no longer valid and all attempts by <BR>myself and others to locate and
    contact the man for the last couple <BR>of years have failed.
