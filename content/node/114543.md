  body: "Even with a [[http://somethingtiny.com.au|better sample]], I wasn't able
    to spot a match. Actually, the more I look at it the more I think it's (almost)
    all customized. Everything looks \"constructed\". /t/i look to share the exact
    same backbone, same for /u/h. I can't even state if the base font was formerly
    a slab serif. \r\nFor what it's worth, I'd probably start with some font like
    [[http://myfonts.us/td-6q2zjK|Insigna]], reconstructing /i from /t and adding
    slab serifs to the whole thing."
