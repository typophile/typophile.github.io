body: "Having done much research about \"font tweaking\", I now came across this highly
  interesting similar \"music tweaking\" case, namely the music performance forgeries
  by Joyce Hatto, described in much detail here\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Hatto\r\n\r\nand
  in dozens of other documents linked from this Wikipedia entry.\r\n\r\nFor instance,
  we read that the \"music tweaking\" (forging) of Chopin Mazurka performances was
  achieved thus:\r\n\r\n\"The CACD20012 release has added filtering, and the speeds
  of each performance pair vary slightly in the range of a few percent (+1.2%, -2.8%,
  and -0.7% for three sample mazurkas).\"\r\n\r\nThis method of \"music tweaking\"
  (music forgery) is very similar to the method of \"font tweaking\" (Fred Smeijers).\r\n\r\nAt
  site http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/21883.html we read:\r\n\r\n\"Smeijers
  introduces the term \"font-tweaking,\" which he clearly doesn't think very much
  of, to describe the currently common process of simply taking an existing typeface
  and ringing a few obvious changes on it, then turning around and presenting it as
  a new design. Some of the results are simple rip-offs; others fall into a wide gray
  area - where does influence give way to plagiarism?\"\r\n\r\nsee http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/?p=183
  and similar sites.\r\n"

  body: " \r\nComparing fonts to music is fun, but the example you give, comparing
    filtering or basic manipulation across these media is the least interesting aspect
    in my opinion. I think these may be less boring...\r\n\r\n\"Tracing\" - which
    is kind of like buying (or photocopying) the sheet music, and recording your own
    version of the song. Requires more skill than filtering or tweaking but the results
    are almost always worse than the original.\r\n\r\n\"Playing by ear\" - knowing
    the basic tune, and playing your own version, bringing your own voice to the recording.
    Depending on your skill you might improve upon the original. In the font world
    most people wouldn't look down on this practice.\r\n\r\nOf course where comparisons
    fall down is the legal protection afforded to music and the power of the recording
    industry - both of which far exceed that afforded to fonts. \r\n"
