  body: It looks like a Victorian typeface called &#39;Hogarth&#39;, as seen in the
    Dover book of Victorian Display Alphabets by Dan X. Solo.  Apparently it is one
    of the fonts included in the Dover &#34;Victorian&#34; Fonts CD made with fonts
    provided by Dan Solo. <BR> <BR>If you need evidence to support this I can scan
    the showing from the book.

  body: BTW, the listing I have of the Dover Font CD contents &#40;courtesy of Mark
    Johannson&#41; is the reason I stated that it is on that CD.
