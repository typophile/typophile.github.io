body: "Hi Everyone, \r\nI was wondering if you could help me with a typeface for a
  project.  I did a logo for a project and was all set to go with it and then the
  name changed.  I attached the previous logo.  \r\nThe new name needs to have capital
  and lowercase letters.  I was wondering if anyone could suggest a good font for
  this.   I like Foundry Gidnnik in medium or bold but I am lookig for something  a
  bit more tough and militaryesque.  The audience is the military and the feel for
  the project is \"security and stealth\" hence the first project name."

    Gothic" or maybe even Microgramma Bold Extended, who knows that.

    Challenge Coins</a> in your project because these coins are made especially for
    the military and you can use them as an award.

    a lowercase (no stencil cutouts, however)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/bold-extended-2-63893/\r\n\r\nTo
    me, \"tough\" and \"stealth\" seem mutually exclusive... I could see \"stealth
    in a VERY light weight sans serif, but \"tough\" usually tends toward somwthing
    like Goudy Oldstyle extrabold; you might compromise on something like Glaser Stencil
    (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/glaser-stencil/), there's a \"rough\" version
    here too."

    Especially the stencil versions?

    has anymore suggestions that would be great.  I do like United but the lowercase
    is important.

      angular for the new title which is 'Gateway'

  body: I have been starting to really like using Blair or Bank Gothic, i am now tring
    to find a font that cooridantes well with them with nice lowercase set. (???)
    The logo will be 'Dark IP' in all caps and then 'Gateway' with lowercase.  i know
    it is a crazy name but i didnt elect to change it, i feel i am in a star wars
    movie.

    Is this \"Gateway\" in any way related to RCAS Gateway? I know some designers
    who worked on graphics for that software package for the military\u2026 must have
    been a little over a decade ago."
