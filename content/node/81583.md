body: Hi there, just went to see the new "Winnie the Pooh" Disney movie. Besides the
  fact that it has been completely drawn by hand, it features a very fine and pleasing
  use of typography. Well, the story is set *inside* the pages of a book, with the
  characters jumping up and down the paragraphs. And, for once, the use of book layout
  and typeface is *very* nice and pleasing, with Adobe Caslon Pro - with ligatures
  turned on! - giving a nice rendition of "old time" fairy tale books. I strongly
  suggest everyone to go and see the movie - in addition, there's a thrilling, psychedelic
  sequence set inside a blackboard which is, by itself, worth looking at the entire
  picture.

  body: "I just saw the official trailer of the English version. I like the pictures,
    but the sound \u2026 My first impression is, that the sound is in contradiction
    to the images much more modern than in the old Disney movies \u2013 but in a simple
    and kitschy way. The sound of the trailer (song and partly the voices) did not
    touch me. If there wouldn\u2019t be the sound, I mainly would recognize the technical
    progress of trick techniques but not a change of the typical Disney style, although
    I did not see the English versions of most Disney movies. What do you think about
    the sound of that movie?"

    \ saw \"african cats\" on earth day... great work...\r\nand the cameras they have
    these days are amazing!\r\nyou could see the fleas buzzing around the faces of\r\nthe
    lions and the cheetahs and all the other animals.\r\nreally remarkable.  the storytelling
    was also fantastic,\r\nwith footage to match in all of the appropriate places.\r\nthere
    were some scenes where it was so perfect that\r\nit seemed like the animals were
    well-rehearsed actors.\r\n"
