  with Sabon? Usually I use Avenir but I'm looking for something new... thanks for
  your advice.

    I assume so. It might be best to know what is available to you first.

    that such innocuous-sounding questions provoke such diverse and impassioned responses.
    I too had strong feelings for Syntax but am going through what can only be described
    as a rather messy break-up with it. \r\n\r\nFWIW, I would contrast graceful Sabon
    with something counterwise, like a gritty grotesque such as the bold or condensed
    weights of <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BureauGrot\">FB Grotesque</a>
    or its antecedent, Monotype Grotesque."

  body: "<cite>Syntax feels so dated to me. Really \u201980s, and not in a good way.</cite>\r\n\r\nAh,
    but I'm a '60s guy -- uh, that's 1960s. We all had more fun in our youth. As you
    said, font selection depends on audience. Older people hire. But maybe I'm tooo
    old.\r\n\r\nSeriously, My real problem with all this is I wouldn't use Sabon.
    It was one of the few text fonts that worked well on the Linotron 202, but somehow
    never survived the transition to PostScript. The PostScript italic is dreadful.\r\n\r\nNow
    if I were hiring a book interior desiger and they used Sabon on their CV, they
    would start pretty far down the list. Things may well be different for people
    hiring another kind of designer, which is what makes your \"audience\" remark
    so very perceptive and appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I disagree with is the
    '80s look. Wasn't that the \"me first\" and \"disco\" decade? I think Syntax rather
    better than that. "

    have a much larger x-height than Sabon and I was trying to narrow it down to the
    best matches."

  body: Punk was for sure late 70s too - provided a welcome antidote to the plastic-ness
    of disco. I remember that brief coexistence too but I think it was more than a
    summer. In NY at least, you had Horses in '76, Talking Heads 77 and the Ramones
    making noise at that time too. You could go to Studio 54 one night and the Mudd
    Club the next.
