I couldn't find any useful information from the general internets, and it's certainly not a kind of ligature ever considered for inclusion into the unicode standard. I also couldn't find a thread in the forums here concerning this type of ligature, so my question really is: who has thought about these?

Has anyone ever seen a discussion of this ligature in a book or on the internet? I'd love to know what history it has.

		<div class="commentbody">Given that a ligature is simply defined as being a combination of two or more characters contracted (or of course, legated) into a single character, it's not that odd a question. However, more importantly, note that the CMoS is concerned with proper North American practices, which has very little to do with the historical use of a character throughout the ages.

Several British people I've asked about this noted that they would use "..?" rather than a full ellipsis and then a question mark, so a natural conclusion is that that practice has to have come from somewhere, and this makes it an interesting topic.

Given that the ellipsis has been around for many centuries, printers and authors throughout the ages must have at some point or another decided -even if merely as experiment to save ink- to legate the ellipsis with the dot in the question and exclamation mark.

I would like to know how (not) widespread that became and have no idea where to start looking, so hopefully people on this forum have some ideas on where to start.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The interrobang is a ligature replacement for ?!, and probably equally unused, but people don't seem to have much trouble calling that a ligature or accepting its existence in unicode at least. Just because it's not in use now, doesn't mean it hasn't been in use in the past, and I am interested in finding out to what degree it was used. Making a judgement call on whether there is 'a point' to some ligature is a bit silly. There's no point to the ffi ligature other than the aesthetic "it looks good" and the practical "it saves lead and ink". The same would go for an ellipsis paired with interpunction that has a dot at its base. It might look better, or it might save ink, and the moment either one of those is considered valid, there's your point.

Just to demonstrate that a point is trivially attributed: let's say someone is doing a poster design for a play with the title "Did you hear what she... ?" and decides that for stylistic purposes it would be quite nice to make use of the vertical space above the ellipsis by contracting the ellipsis and questionmark and reshaping the questionmark curve so that it overlaps most of the space above the ellipsis. That is now a ligature. This is how they come about.

None of the historical ligatures come from committees deciding to combine letters, they were invented by typesetters and writers (and in some cases, those writers influenced other writers, who in turn ended up influencing the entire written language). If one can think of a ligature that looks good, voila, one may be born. Just because you could approximate it doesn't mean there will never be a point to a "real" one; that's up to the minds of the people who actually use them.

But, we all digress, as that wasn't the point of this thread - it was primarily about getting pointers on where to look in order to find some kind of history of ellipsis ligatures, or at least a discussion of the use of "..?" and "..!" (or as texnic points out for Russian, "?.." and "!..")

So please, no more replies in the form of "it's a silly ligature" or "why would you use it", that is irrelevant. Does anyone know of a documented history of this stylistic choice?</div>

No, a ligature is a combination of two or more characters represented by a single <em>glyph.</em>

An ellipsis mark consists of three dots, either by themselves... or followed by a fourth dot or other punctuation if they occur at the end of a sentence.... What you refer to as a 'stylistic choice' looks to me like a grammatical error.</div>

<em>The ellipsis itself is three periods (<strong>always</strong>); it can appear next to other punctuation, including an end-of-sentence period (resulting in four periods). Use four only when the words on either side of the ellipsis make full sentences. You should <strong>never use fewer than three nor more than four periods</strong>, with only a single exception: when entire lines of poetry are omitted in a block quotation, it's a common practice to replace them with a full line of spaced periods</em> [emphasis added].</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The interesting question is how to design the ellipsis glyph. Should the dots be the same size as the period? No less an authority than Matthew Carter sometimes makes them the same, sometimes different. What's the ideal? How should they be spaced, and conceivably kerned, in relation to the period? If you are doing a four-dot ellipse (i.e. an end-of-sentence ellipse) then is it desirable that the dots of the ellipse be different from the dots of the period? </div>
