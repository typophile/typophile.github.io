  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone Im a graphic design student in need of some support with my thesis. I would like to write it on Legibility / Serif vs. Sans Serif/ In information design. However I am in need of a question/argument for a proposal and would be grateful for any suggestions.

26/oct/09  I now have a clear understanding of readability and how it can inhibit or enhance how we read and have decided to focus my new research on the readability of partially sighted people. Do you think we have done all we can typographically to enhance readability for partially sighted people? Should guidelines be updated/reviewed/changed? Do guidelines differ in different parts of the world etc.. Any comments and suggestions are welcome

Thank you

		<div class="commentbody">Well, [[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-30-5|'The Stroke: Theory of Writing]]' by Gerrit Noordzij is an interesting read (although there are some here on TP that don't like it). 

While it mostly deals with how tools affected letterforms historically and how this is still visible in contemporary type design (i.e. broad-nib pen, pointed pen, etc.) it also has parts about word-shapes and the relation between black and white (or shape and counter-shape; e.g. [[bouma]], [[notan]] and [[word shape]]). Which is an important part of how we read (even more so than what individual letters look like). This is also something that Unger writes about in his book I mentioned earlier. It would probably be an important part of your research. </div>

For nearly a century, researchers have been trying to find which fonts are most legible but it seems they still haven't found a definitive answer.

Have a look at this discussion: http://typophile.com/node/52737
Pelli is one of the most renowned legibility researchers – maybe the study he is talking about has been published by now, it would certainly be an interesting read.</div>

Worth reading, but they failed to counterbalance the order in which participants were exposed to the typefaces.

I'm in the process of reviewing a series of 12 Tinker papers, one of which is about fonts, and it showed that (surprizingly) many different fonts had no significant effect on reading time. I do not believe that comprehension was assessed. Also an interesting paper. Well written and an easy read. However, there was a failure to counterbalance the passages , fonts and orders in which they were received across participants.

I'd still read both.</div>

Since science can study anything in the material world from how the optics of the eye work to make corrective glasses, to how to simulate 3D on a 2D screen to create 3D movies, I don’t know how you can make this claim. Perhaps you also think we haven’t made it to the moon? There is nothing magic or supernatural about legibility/readability, so of course we can measure it.

I don’t know what studies Licko was citing, but I do know that Sofie Beier at the Royal College of Art has been doing research on the familiarity of fonts and intends to talk about it at next year’s ATypI conference in Dublin.

I have argued my position on this forum repeatedly, so if you don't know by now, you haven't been paying attention! 
Once more: I am not suggesting that science is bunk, merely that your claims to be able to determine the readability of fonts is bad science. It is quite possible to measure the readability of specific texts in laboratory situations, as you do, but to suppose that you are consequently measuring the readability of fonts in the wild is a non sequitur.

As a measurable quality, readability is a property of documents, not fonts.
It is art directors, graphic designers and typographers who determine readability, not scientists.

The same typestyle can be legible or illegible if used well or badly, but a typestyle can still have its own intrinsic contribution to readability. Thus, one typeface, as opposed to another, might remain readable even in small sizes, even with close spacing and no leading, and so on.</div>

Yes, but that can't be measured.
Therefore, one art director may use a text font in a magazine and the readability is great, yet someone else may use the same font in a different magazine, with almost the exact same specs, and it's no good.

		<div class="commentbody">Come to think of it, I may not disagree with you about readability. Legibility and readability, after all, are two different things.

A measurement of legibility can of course be conducted by scientific means - people will identify a letter without context X% of the time if it's in that font, and Y% of the time if it's in this other font. (It might be more interesting to compare fonts where the x-height rather than the point size is kept the same.)

But "readability" means something much more subjective, although it is often confused with legibility.</div>

That's certainly a more realistic way than just going by the manufacturer's nominal sizing. Another is to spec two fonts so that they both fit the same amount of copy in a given space, which is the method I use when designing news text faces. However, even that involves some element of subjectivity in choosing the optimum leading and H&Js for each font.

Type size is another inconvenient truth: it's impossible to measure the size of a typeface!</div>

Nick, I think this might be the core of why we always disagree. My assumption is that readability is a property of visual perception, and that readability is about optimizing text for the capabilities of the human eye and brain. Everyone’s visual perception is roughly the same: light goes through lenses, is focused on the back of the retina, photoreceptors absorb that light, ganglion cells look for edge boundaries, and so on. Readable text will allow the visual system to recognize letters and words quickly.

I don’t think art directors, typographers, or scientists determine readability. Art directors and typographers can create different designs that may or may not be optimized for the human visual system. Scientists can measure the speed of processing a design in the human visual system. Creating and measuring aren’t in opposition to each other; they both should be part of the design process.

> An inconvenient truth for Kevin.

Yes, there is no single measure for type size, and different layout variables may interact (e.g. leading and line length). It’s not actually a problem. It just means that design is complex.

None. I didn’t conduct any studies on the ClearType font collection until after they were completed. We are working on a new font now where conducting legibility research is part of the design process. After a version of the font is created, measuring is done to see which letters are processed quickly and which are processed more slowly. The results are then used to create a new version of the font. I look forward to talking about this in detail after the font is published.
