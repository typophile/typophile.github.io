  body: "Typedog, you might need to be quick. According to the online edition \r\nof
    <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,601693,00.html\">Der
    Spiegel</a> (sorry, the article looks like it's available in German only), \r\nthey're
    already facing a lawsuit; the State of Bavaria is pressing even \r\nfor a recall
    of the issue already published over a (contested) copyright violation. \r\nThey
    claim to hold the rights to those newspapers originally published by \r\nthe Eher
    publishing house, such as \"Der Angriff\" reprinted in the first issue.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    one exponent of the \"Zeitungszeugen\" team is quoted as saying \r\nthat even
    if they are not granted access to the newspapers published by Eher\r\nany more,
    they will still be able to continue with the project \u2013 though of course\r\nwith
    a more limited selection of material.\r\n\r\nMy favorite line of argumentation
    used by the Bavarians (not surprisingly): \r\nThat material is <em>dangerous</em>
    and can't just be reprinted & sold. And if some researchers really are that interested
    in it, they can always visit a library!\r\n(I'm sure those \"endangered\" wouldn't
    know how to use a library.)"

    in West Germany 2 years ago, too bad it was not around during that time.  Is there
    any chance there is a digital copy available?  I agree that it can be dangerous
    for Germany impressionable folk (skinheads/neo-nazi's).  Too bad I cant not read
    in Deutsch."

    the web site. They do however take subscriptions, so you might be able to order
    an individual copy; I'd email them directly (contact form / address is <a href=\"http://www.zeitungszeugen.de/kontakt/\">here</a>)."
