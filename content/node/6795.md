  body: "Hm, was about to post this as a new type ID as the font caught my eye at
    the bus stop today.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Smirnoff_Flavours_ad_image_LIME_5717.jpg]\r\nIt's
    very cool in a kind of Schwartz way but he lists his custom work on <a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/munich.shtml\">his
    own website</a>, where this doesn't appear. Maybe someone has an idea?"

  body: "Well some online research has led me to <a href=\"http://www.threebrand.com/page/Smirnoff_Lime.aspx\">Threeview</a>
    agency in Edinburgh, who seem to be responsible for the latest ad campaign. I've
    just e-mailed to see if they can tell us the designer.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Nailed it!
    Just discovered it is the work of a <a href=\"http://www.jesseragan.com/work-smirnoff.html\">Jesse
    Ragan</a> commissioned in 2003 through H&FJ, called Smirnoff. Nice work, Jesse."
