  and I finally jumped in to something and realized that it's unfortunately not like
  riding a bike. Specifically, I found that my eye for kerning is in atrophy. {Okay,
  so maybe my eye for kerning, composition, and color are all in atrophy.} I haven't
  really been able to tell where adjustments need to be made \u2014 hopefully it will
  come back to me. I have attached a title slide that I had put together, in hope
  that someone could point out a few spots where the kerning could use some tweaking.
  Maybe with some help I can begin to start seeing things the way I used to.\r\n\r\nI
  am also hoping that someone would recommend some light reading about typography.
  I'm in desperate need of motivation and/or inspiration.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCasey"

  body: "I'll give it a go, although I'm not 100% confident of my kerning ability
    either.\r\n\r\nClose up the space on both sides of the \"o\" in Louis; both sides
    of the first \"d\" in Mildred; the whole word Adam needs help, but especially
    closing up the space around the \"d\"; and tighten the space around the \"w,\"
    \"s,\" and \"o\" in Wilson.\r\n\r\nAs for light reading, I can suggest some things
    to read, but I'm not sure if much of what I've read about type would be considered
    light (although I read it for my enjoyment).\r\n\r\nI've always been enamored
    with [[http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189913912&sr=8-1|Bringhurst]],
    so if you haven't read that, go for it. Even though reading something akin to
    a style guide/type speciment sounds dry, it's gripping as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI'm
    in the middle of <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/Counterpunch-sixteenth-century-designing-typefaces/dp/0907259065/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189914002&sr=8-1|Counterpunch]]</em>,
    which is quite good so far. I wouldn't have thought a book largely about the mechanical
    side of type would be interesting (I've never been much for this kind of stuff),
    but in fact, Smeijers explains it so clearly that you feel like a master punchcutter
    reading it. The beginning part also has some thought-provoking points to make
    about the Renaissance revival of classical letterforms.\r\n\r\nAh-ha! Two good,
    lightish type books: <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568986998/ref=wl_it_dp/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&coliid=I24IVWHBG78ZY4&colid=3JXWXBKAYLA0F|79

    with FontFont]]</em>. Michael Bierut talks about design in general, not just type,
    but he has some entertaining things to say about both graphic design and typefaces
    (check especially his essay \"I Hate ITC Garamond\"). <em>FontFont</em> is useful
    for introducing oneself to the highlights of the FontFont library. Some of the
    essays are fascinating (Martin Majoor's I remember), while others are less so
    and are outdated. A number of the type specimens are brilliant as well (the one
    for FF Unit contains a hilarious story by Twain, and I the one for FF Nexus, I
    believe, is absolutely incredible)."

    which I can recommend. Very little of it is explicitly about typography -- a short
    postscript to one of the talks, and occasional references elsewhere -- but in
    a sense the whole book is about typography in that is is about the things that
    make typography matter.

  body: Endre, I'm glad you said that! I feel the same way about <em>Stop Stealing
    Sheep</em> -- it is a very good book, but clearly intended for a non-designer
    audience. Few people ever point this out when recommending it, or when comparing
    it to other books on typography.

    Something like Bringhurst's <em>Solid Form of Language</em> that you can read
    in one sitting, and then read five more times and still absorb more. Hopefully
    Lawson's title will be a \"quick\" 432 pages...\r\n\r\nRe, Eben:\r\nWhich Tschichold

    three of the books I mentioned are broken up into chapters or essays, so they
    are easy to put down and pick up again as the mood or time strikes you (similar
    to what Tim said about McLean's book). But 400+ pages in one sitting -- yeah,
    that's a tough one.  ;-D\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Lupton's book is easily read
    in just a few days, and has plenty of substance (not that the others don't, of
    course).\r\n\r\nAbout <em>Revival of the Fittest</em> -- I think it rapidly went
    out of print, because it goes for  lots of dollars on Amazon, hence my comment...
    but you can still find copies in antiquarian book stores. And there is always
    your friendly public library."

    mentioned it in part because it seems to me that Bringhurst's ideas about caps
    spacing especially are more Zaph oriented ( the tighter model ) and were also
    ideas that I was confident you would run into. Whereas Jan's ideas ( wider ) are
    less common. I don't suggest either one per se - I just think they both have merit
    and are worth mulling over.\r\n\r\nMy current idea about it in case you want to
    know is that the forms of Caps aught to be a factor in your approach. Some cap
    forms really benefit from wider spacing. I feel like Gil/Johnston style or English
    style caps fall into that category. With other forms it's reversed. In any event
    it's about cultivating & trusting your eye. Being able to modify forms can help
    too if the forms will be big it's and a tricky word like OCTOBER or LAWYERS."
