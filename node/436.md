  body: 'I don&#39;t recall if any of this was already mentioned in this  <BR>thread,
    but . . . <BR> <BR>There were several Caslons produced by all of the  <BR>major
    foundries. This particular cut traces its lineage in  <BR>this country back to
    the Old Style of Philadelphia  <BR>typefounder Laurence Johnson. Legend has it
    that in  <BR>1858 he arranged with Wm. Caslon&#39;s successors to  <BR>duplicate
    the Caslon fonts in this country. Accounts  <BR>vary about whether he obtained
    original matrices,  <BR>unfinished strikes, or freshly cast fonts from which he  <BR>made
    electrotyped matrices.  <BR> <BR>Johnson later merged into MacKellar, Smiths &amp;
    Jordan,  <BR>which in turn became part of the American Type  <BR>Founders Company.
    ATF re-released the Caslon fonts  <BR>under the name Caslon Oldstyle No. 471.
    This is the  <BR>face that Linotype used as a model for their Caslon Old  <BR>Face
    &#40;note: <i>not</i> Old <i>Style</i>&#41;, which is what your sample is  <BR>set
    in. <BR> <BR>The uneven baseline and x-height -- look at that  <BR><i>v, w,</i>
    &amp; <i>x</i>! -- are presumably carried over from the  <BR>original, rough hand-cutting
    by Wm. Caslon himself.  <BR>These effects are seen in the ATF foundry type, though  <BR>perhaps
    to a slightly differing degree. If Johnson  <BR>created his own mats from either
    unfinished strikes or  <BR>by electrotyping, then some of the unevenness could  <BR>have
    been introduced at that point.  <BR> <BR>Some of the bounce in this sample, however,
    may  <BR>be unique to this setting somehow. That excitable <i>u</i>  <BR>is not
    to be seen quite so jumpy in Lino samples that  <BR>I have. <BR> <BR>Note that
    the Linotype cutting has slightly different  <BR>vertical proportions, most notably
    in the shortened  <BR>descenders, to accommodate Lino&#39;s standard  <BR>alignment.  <BR>

  body: 'I have a copy of the 1924 Caslon Co. specimen, which is interesting and may
    be instructively compared to the original 18th Century specimen. The marketing
    spiel in the 1924 version makes a big deal about the types being &#39;cast entirely
    from matrices produced from the original punches engraved in the early part of
    the 18th Century&#39;. What is interesting about this claim is that it doesn&#39;t
    note that the alignment, spacing and finishing of the matrices was much refined
    during the intervening 200 years. I don&#39;t have a photo of the 18th C. specimen,
    or the 19th C. specimen produced by Wm Caslon III -- which I do own --, but here
    is a close up from the 1924 specimen &#40;14pt, but the same observations can

    alt="Caslon Old Face 1924&#44; 14pt"> <BR> <BR>If you compare this image to the
    Linotype Caslon picture provided by William Berkson, above, you will see that
    the vertical alignment in the Caslon 1924 version is much better. The Linotype
    version looks like it has emulated the worst aspects of the 18th Century type,
    presumably in an attempt to be authentic. Personally, I think the 1924 Caslon
    specimen shows the Old Face types &#40;and also some of the big types and blackletters&#41;
    at their very best: the result not of the fetishisation of the original, but of
    200 years of proprietorial familiarity with a design that the firm was not afraid
    to improve. The conceit of the specimen pages is also delightful: re-settings
    of famous English books, e.g. the first folio edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays,
    showing how much better they would have looked if set in Caslon Old Face.'

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>You point to small types. I am in agreement and I am happy
    to see you on my side wanting optical scaling to be included in Open Type. <BR>
    <BR>On the matter of absorbant papers however. I am not sure which ones you are
    speaking of. Most print very crisp. <BR> <BR>But if you mean papers that tend
    to &#34;wick&#34; that is different problem. Sometimes a good ink, or doctoring,
    could over come that for you. If not, a different stock serves better than a bigger
    aspirin.  <BR> <BR>My point was we should not be &#34;imitating results&#34; such
    as the one you mentioned. Too much time could be spent trying to overcome one
    specific problem. After all there are many different papers, inks not to mention
    printers. Which ones do we imitate? Which problems do we attempt to solve. <BR>
    <BR>I realize there are some that think a car looks more beautiful after a crash
    than when it came from the showroom, hopefully there are very few of them. <BR>
    <BR>Also I realize there are font companies specializing in fonts for differenct
    kinds of printing processes, and papers. David Burlow&#39;s for example. That,
    however, is highly specialized work, and from the reports I have, the fonts are
    all for one family of paper, &#34;newsprint&#34;. <BR> <BR>Imagine were we to
    follow that example for all known papers, with all fonts in the existing libraries.
    There would be more fonts than locusts in China. <BR> <BR>So if we are to imitate,
    or indulge in prophecy of circumstances we will certainly be busy doing very little
    creative work. I&#39;d rather tend shovel bull manure. <BR> <BR>John <BR> <BR>The
    showing of your Caslon specimen is over inked, as such, will hide some of the
    &#34;fetishisation&#34; of which you speak. You are correct that both the Linotype,
    and Lanston cuttings were based on an &#34;earlier&#34;, Caslon &#34;state&#34;.
    Also, importantly &#34;a smaller point size&#34;. A smaller point size is a big
    consideration when cutting punches. The smaller the size, the more emphasized
    the imperfections when blown up. The new &#34;state&#34; of the Caslon foundery
    did not eliminate those imperfections other than perhaps re-aligning, tightening,
    and making more upright the characters. <BR> <BR>The bigger actual hot metal pt.
    size the smoother it &#34;should look&#34; when cut by a hand punchcutter. <BR>
    <BR>So some of the smoothosity is due to working scale. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa

    ...not ..fetishisation of the original. <BR> <BR>I am not &#39;fetishising&#39;
    the original, just trying to learn from it.  <BR> <BR>The jumpy base line of the
    Linotype in my sample is clearly an undesirable mechanical failing. The overinking
    on your sample, if Giampa is correct &#40;and it also looks that way to my non-expert
    eye&#41;, is also a failing. I like the &#39;color&#39; of my sample better. Because
    of the overinking on your sample I can&#39;t compare the variation in color of
    the letters that Hrant pointed to as a main feature of my sample. <BR> <BR>The
    hypothesis I am pursuing is that digital type has gone too far in uniformity -
    particularly of color and tightness of fit. Caslon is an apt place to test the
    hypothesis, because it is obviously less uniform than most faces, yet one of the
    most used and returned to over the centuries.  <BR> <BR>Is the looser fit of my
    sample, which Giampa interestingly says is a feature of limitations of the Linotype
    machine, a good thing for readibility? The answer isn&#39;t obvious to me.  <BR>
    <BR>I think it is also an interesting question whether cap height being lower
    than ascender height - a principle I believe of Morrison - is actually sound.
    Sure, it does result in less uniformity of color to have full height caps. And
    I can see that in German this would be distracting, as all nouns are in caps.
    But in English it may be a nice relief and marker to the eye as a beginning of
    sentences. &#40;Adobe Caslon does preserve the full size caps.&#41; <BR> <BR>Overall,
    I want to get to the library to see more old samples - but if some people can

    Adobe Caslon over your sample, at the same size, the spacing matched and the letter
    forms were very close. The main difference seems to be the greater weight due
    to ink spread. The Linotype Caslon Old Face to my eye has significant differences
    in letter form from either. The spacing is also looser. I don&#39;t know about
    Langston&#39;s Caslon 337 by comparison. I think Founders Caslon 12 is of limited
    use because it imitates the random clumps of ink of the 18th century, before Baskerville
    and others used better inks. This will always have a forced antique look.  <BR>
    <BR>But using some of the irregularities of the original is to me an open different
    question.Here is my late Uncle Ben Lieberman writing about Caslon in &#39;Types
    of Typefaces&#39; &#40;1968&#41;:  <BR> <BR>&#34;The typeface which Caslon introduced
    in 1734 was an instant success, and except for one brief period in the 19th century
    has remained popular ever since, yet it is perhaps the most controversial face
    in history. Some persons consider it the greatest type ever &#40;they have popularized
    a motto &#34;When in doubt, use Caslon&#34;&#41; and other think it overrated,
    a collection of mistakes, elusively out of keeping with everything. But - it works,
    is hightly readable, alive, with warmth and open dignity that has no pretense
    whatsoever. Caslon is the prime example of a face in which the individual letters
    are nothing, but the total effect is strong and honest.&#34; <BR> <BR>From this
    thread, it looks like the controversy is not about to go away. But I don&#39;t
    see Adobe Caslon used that much. And I suspect that isn&#39;t just changing fashion,
    but that somehow it misses that elusive something that has made Caslon so successful

    Lanston&#39;s 337 into pages along with Founder&#39;s. <BR> <BR>My advice: Founder&#39;s
    Caslon: try it, you&#39;ll like it,'

  body: Justin Howes seem to have &#34;cheated&#34; and introduced quite a few kerns
    in Founder&#39;s, and this, along with the &#34;ink effect&#34; makes it darker
    than 337.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve used 337 as a sort of &#34;Caslon Light&#34; at intermediate
    sizes. Sometimes Founder&#39;s can look heavy in the 22 to 30 pt. range.

  body: '<i>1&#41; Are you suggesting a new digital Caslon should be based on the
    Caslon 1924 re-fitting?</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m saying that I would find such a typeface
    more immediately and more broadly useful than any of the current digital Caslons.
    Sadly, Adobe Caslon is the only version that is suited to a wide range of typographic
    application, but it doesn&#39;t look like Caslon, so what&#39;s the point? <BR>
    <BR><i>2&#41; Are you suggesting it should be based on the overinked specimen
    sheet, or based the lead types which could be easily found? </i> <BR> <BR>I would
    like to have two versions: one for letterpress printing from polymer, and one
    for offset printing, but NOT because the latter should reproduce overinking or
    ink gain/smear. Letterpress printing puts a bite into the surface of the page,
    which somehow makes the type seem more <i>there</i>. Offset printing is very often
    too light, underinked, and ends up looking grey and unconvincing. In letterpress,
    the ink is pressed into the fibres of the paper; in offset, very often, the paper
    actually affects the colour of the type, which is not dense enough and does not
    penetrate enough. Robert Reid told me he often has the impression that offset
    printed text could be blown off the page by a gust of wind. <BR> <BR>I think types
    printed offset often benefit from being slightly heavier than that used for letterpress
    printing. I don&#39;t think this is really about ink gain/smear, as some people
    have suggested, but simply about the way in which the ink and the letterform interract
    with the paper in the two different technologies. <BR> <BR>Note also that I adjusted
    the contrast on the photo because it was rather dark, so this might affect the
    impression that the specimen is overinked. Unfortunately, looking at photographs
    of type is no substitute for looking at the real thing. <BR> <BR><i>3&#41; Are
    you suggesting it should be based on &#34;14. pt as you have illustrated? </i>
    <BR> <BR>Well, ideally we would have a different font for each size. This is especially
    true for Caslon, who varied his forms considerably between sizes; much more than,
    say, Bodoni, who seems to have followed a fairly linear pattern <BR> <BR><i>4&#41;
    Do you remember the Caslon Challenge? </i> <BR> <BR>I do, although not well enough
    to make a guess <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>It should be noted that none of my thoughts are intended to
    suggest any kind of absolute rule or preference. I have no doubt at all that a
    skilled printer can make even the lightest digital Caslon &#40;probably 337&#41;
    look good even in offset. I am very conscious, however, that quality book typography
    and printing is a small proportion of the typesetting and printing that happens
    in the world, and I would like to have a Caslon that could take some abuse and
    still come out readable. Apart from offset printing, there are webpress, laser
    and inkjet systems, etc., and I&#39;m not refering to office and home printers
    but to large scale commercial printing devices.'

  body: I&#39;m saying that extra weight that might benefit a type in offset printing
    does not need to be based on ink gain in letterpress printing. Why should it?
    Modern types designed for the principal modern printing technologies, not based
    on historical models and not in any sense revivals, also benefit from being heavier
    than letterpress types. It would be perverse to approach such design from the
    perspective of trying to imagine what a letterpress version of such a typeface
    might look like if printed with a bit too much ink. Since you&#39;re so fond of
    saying, Hrant, that type design should be based on how people read not on how
    they used to write, you might agree that types should be designed for how people
    print not how they used to print.

    simulating the old stuff&#41;. <BR> <BR>What I thought you said was that the reason
    offset fonts need to be darker than letterpress fonts is not related to gain -
    and I think it is. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
