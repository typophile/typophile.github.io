  body: At first I thought Gill Sans, but the s is different. I played around a little
    and it seems really close to Paddington - but the numbers don't match up to the
    second example. Sorry I couldn't help more...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temptation_3597.gif]

    and numerals look like <a href="http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008">Gotham</a>

    a long time and that would be my first choice.

  body: "@ Brown Fox \u2013 are you sure? Just that the lowercase 'a' looks different
    no?\r\n\r\nI would alos very much like to own that font so if anyone does know
    where it can be got, or something ver similar then let it be known!\r\n\r\nMinimalista,
    theres this on a gill-esque note, its very nice, but not entirely similar:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/device/english-grotesque/"
