  Our small (micro...nano?) press has been publishing eBooks for 2 years now and we
  are finally diving in to the world of print books. I know very little about choosing
  type faces, but I am not blind to the aesthetics of the printed word. \r\n\r\nWe
  are a publisher of both contemporary and historical fiction. I want a font that
  is easy reading, has a timeless character (leaning toward the modern), is distinctive,
  and is suitable for digital printing. My two top candidates at the moment are Hoftype
  Cala, and Okay Type Harriet.\r\n\r\nI want to stay away from the usual suspects
  for book design (Minion, Bembo, Garamond, ...) but not get too crazy either. Any
  help, or suggestions for further learning are welcome. "

    a timeless & classic font.\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\nBest thing to do with a first job
    is to steal like crazy. Go into a bookstore & find something you like. Not like
    to look at, but to read. Rip off the design. The more you try to put your fingerprints
    on it, the greater the odds you'll make a mistake.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned two fonts,
    Hoftype Cala, and Okay Type Harriet. Well, the letterforms of Cala look like they
    will print on an offset press, using an uncoated stock. That's not true of the
    Harriet.\r\n\r\nI don't know these fonts, aside from seeing the letterforms as
    they pop up on Google. Space is a more important factor in reading than letterforms.
    How's the fit of the characters? If you set a page or two, using the trim, margins,
    and type size you want, how many leadings (linefeeds) work well with the chosen
    type size? If it's zero, it is a bad typeface. If it's one, there are many better.\r\n\r\n<cite>but
    I am not blind to the aesthetics of the printed word. </cite> \r\n\r\nWell, if
    we're talking about the printed word as it occurs in an object, the book, then
    you should already know the spacial relationships are most important.\r\n\r\nYour
    posting here, and your emphasis on \"something new\" suggests to me you're primarily
    interested in leterforms. I could be wrong; let's assume not. Readers don't much
    care about letterforms. They read words -- really, clumps of words.  If you want
    to say letterforms have a subtle influence, I agree. But if a typeface has a major
    problem, appealing letterforms don't even start to make up for it.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a couple good presses in Texas -- award wining designers, with production
    values that go beyond \"graphic design.\" They might well be willing to talk,
    to give you a hand. Try Mary Ann Jacobs at Texas A&M, and/or Ellen McKie at UT-Austin.\r\n\r\nIf
    they would see you, a visit would be very educational, I'd think, and Texas A&M
    should be within driving distance from Houston. Kevin Grossman would be another
    contact at Texas A&M."

    possible, and it's very true that most beginners put too much emphasis on the
    black bodies of letterforms. But there <em>is</em> such a thing as novelty of

  body: "To me, a large part of \"texture\" suggests the balance between the fine
    lines and the thick, and the overall weight, as the type is spaced.\r\n\r\nQuick:
    did the \"texture\" of Galliard change when we went from repro-negative-plate
    to DTP? Galliard was a brilliant, beautiful face. And why do so many people say
    \"was\"? Because the relationship of its fine lines to thick was critical, as
    with the Didones, Bodonis, etc., and that relationship got messed up as the way
    of putting ink on paper changed. So, yes, the texture of Galliard changed, even
    though the letterforms didn't.\r\n\r\nTo me, all you're really saying is the good
    modern designers have finally read Smeijer's <cite>Counterpoint</cite>, and have
    learned that the drawing of the letterforms is is only a first step. The next
    is how a particular technology puts ink on paper or pixels on a screen.  At the
    desired size. Something the guys in the metal era did automatically when they
    inked a punch & pressed it into paper."

    What I'm really talking about is things like Legato and Fenland.\r\n\r\n\"Counterpunch\"
    (sp.) is a great book, and helps those detached from previous eras a great deal
    (which describes me back when I read it). But it really just explains a precedent.
    For myself, the most valuable part of \"Counterpunch\" was the discussion of how
    the \"j\" could be reformed; this led me to my Alphabet Reform work, and to my
    rejection of chirographic type. BTW it's certainly a paradox that I'm pretty sure
    Smeijers doesn't agree with me on that in the least.  :-)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Something
    the guys in the metal era did automatically when they inked a punch & pressed

    proofs</em> when cutting the punches, so they didn't actually see the accurate
    end-result very early - they needed a lot of experience to be able to reduce costly
    iteration. In digital we iterate much faster, and certainly much cheaper.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is what I was after, yes. To be clear, I am not obsessed with letterforms. I am
    more concerned with how the text flows, the overall texture of the page, and especially
    what kind of \"feeling\" is produced. For example, I understand why Garamond is
    used so much since it produces a good looking page that is easy to read. However,
    when I show specimens of candidate fonts to our people, Garamond always gets the
    comment, \"old fashioned\".  That isn't something I want people to associate with
    our work.\r\n\r\nMinion passes the look and feel requirements, and I may use it
    if nothing else can be found. Part of our branding strategy is to differentiate
    ourselves from other publishers. Setting books in Minion doesn't further that
    goal. I realize that readers aren't going to notice that we are using a popular
    font or something more obscure, but readers are not the only target audience.
    Potential authors, artists, designers, and editors will also see our work, and
    some of them may actually be paying attention to the details of how the books
    are put together and making judgments about us based on those observations."

    your eye doesn't tell you, you'll probably have to learn the hard way, by doing.
    With all fonts, learn to look at the letterforms and what the final, printed result
    looks like. Eventually, you should learn what happens to a font* with all kinds
    of presses, and all kinds of paper. \r\n\r\nType on the screen isn't my forte,
    but likely something similar happens there, too.\r\n\r\nBTW, for those commenting
    on Galliard: it was pretty much always a \"digital\" font, if you count the Linotype
    202 and 505 as \"digital.\" Some do, some don't. Some like to have it both ways,
    depending on what they're pontificating about.\r\n\r\nThe Bitstream versions were
    always digital. Finally, there was no change in the letterforms of Carter & Cone
    Galliard after it was released in the 1990s, again as PostScript. The only subsequent
    changes were in the platemaking technologies used for offset printing.\r\n\r\n*The
    \"font\" being different than the \"design.\" "

    even allow I have a bias toward Miller.  I cut italic OS figs for it, as Matthew

    & approved them before I used it."
