body: This is another of my current projects - a sans that is gothic in structure,
  but with some improvisations. The q and g speak for themselves. The alphabets aren&#39;t
  finished and some letters need work, but I&#39;d like to know what people think.

  body: 'Hi Paul. <BR> <BR>I Like what you&#39;re up to here. It certainly has more
    character than what I was up to in my thread. The highlights I think are the unicase
    q and the g. The ear is fantastic!  <BR> <BR>A couple of thoughts: <BR> <BR>1&#41;
    Your rounds need to extend beyond the baseline/x-height in order to optically
    sit on the baseline. &#40;a,b,c,d,e,g,p,q,s,u&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41; The s and
    A look light, also give a little extra weight to the vertical parts of your rounds
    &#40;ie. so the left and right sides of the o &#40;c &amp; e&#41; opticaly match
    the width of the stem of the b etc. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Try the diagonal ends on the
    t and f at slightly less of an angle. Maybe apply this idea to other terminals
    &#40;r, s&#41; <BR> <BR>4&#41; The e is going to close up at small sizes. Try
    giving it more room at the top. <BR> <BR>Good start! <BR>Randy'

    <BR> <BR>I usually do these adjustments in Fontlab once I have all the glyphs
    designed. I&#39;m still in Illustrator Phase right now.  <BR> <BR><i>3&#41; Try
