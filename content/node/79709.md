  Most Typical Face on the Planet</a> video by the National Geographic yesterday,
  which is really well done, and it got me wondering if you guys know some websites
  dedicated to motion typography -- either collections of exemplary works, or tutorials
  for people who want to get into the field. '

  body: "This is known as Kinetic Typography and that video is very poor. You can
    find a large collection of Kinetic type videos in the Vimeo group [[http://vimeo.com/channels/kinetictypography|here]]\r\n\r\nKinetic
    typography is motion design so I doubt there are any websites specifically about
    it. The best examples will be found in film title sequences ([[http://www.watchthetitles.com/|Forget
    The Film, Watch The Titles]] and [[http://www.artofthetitle.com/|Art Of The Title
    Sequence]])\r\n\r\nRobert BrownJohn created a brilliant video for Midland Bank
    in the 60's demonstrating kinetic typography. It's the best example that I've
    seen. [[http://video.yandex.ru/users/videoblog/view/1504/|Watch the video here]]\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
