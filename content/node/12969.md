  today. Some of you may know me as the creator/operator of Zang-O-Fonts.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a new site dedicated to, and created for the font community; designers, fans and
  lurkers alike.\r\n\r\nIt offers news, events, commentary and as a celebration of
  it's birth, there's a contest to win some fonts from <a href=\"http://www.zangofonts.com\"
  target=\"_blank\">Zang-O-Fonts</a>.\r\n\r\nIn future months we plan on bringing
  you bigger and better things, as well as commentary from some of the bigger names
  in the community.\r\n\r\nThis site is meant as a supplement to other community sites
  like typophile.com and typographica. I love these sites myself, and wouldn't want
  to encroach on what they offer, but wanted to give back in some way.\r\n\r\nGo,
  visit the site. Enjoy it and use it. That's what it's there for. "

    box, etc. Find the niche everyone has overlooked. Ignore the mainstream RSS and
    Atom feeds. They are getting to be a bit trivial and ridiculous and it seems that
    the folks hooked into them are no longer thinking on their own.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n"
