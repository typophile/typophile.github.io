  body: ' This is serious. Maybe the best thing on this forum yet. <BR> <BR>Wonderful
    integration of curves and cuts. It&#39;s clear you&#39;re not afraid to see through
    the superficial rules of type design - instead getting and giving a taste the
    real juices inside. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s very nice to see straightness where we usually
    see mushy curves, like in the lc &#34;a&#34;, &#34;g&#34; and &#34;s&#34;. In
    the &#34;g&#34;, though, maybe the straightness should &#34;end&#34; sooner -
    I think it&#39;s pushing the lower counter a bit out of shape. Do you know what
    I mean? Also in the &#34;g&#34;: you might want to make the head have vertical
    stress - like your &#34;o&#34;. <BR> <BR>The lc &#34;a&#34;&#39;s tail should
    maybe be more like the finials of the lc &#34;c&#34; and &#34;e&#34;. The lefthand
    &#34;stubs&#34; of the lc &#34;f&#34; and &#34;t&#34; are a wonderful shape, but
    they seem to be making a dark spot, especially in the &#34;f&#34; &#40;which btw
    has a great righthand foot serif, as does the &#34;r&#34;&#41;. The lc &#34;k&#34;
    is killer! For the lc &#34;q&#34;, maybe consider making the serif on the descender
    righthand only. I would give the lc &#34;r&#34; a stronger beak. The &#34;seats&#34;
    of the &#34;v&#34; and &#34;w&#34; are amazing. And the lc &#34;y&#34; is the
    real thing. The comma should maybe be more of a comma - less of a period with
    an appendix. <BR> <BR>UC: Maybe lower the bar of the &#34;F&#34;. I&#39;d make
    the &#34;G&#34;&#39;s beard sharp &#40;like the lc &#34;b&#34;&#39;s seat&#41;.
    The top-left of the &#34;M&#34; and &#34;N&#34; is just too good. But I think
    the &#34;M&#34; needs to be wider - maybe open up the middle &#34;V&#34;. I&#39;d
    make the &#34;P&#34;&#39;s head bigger. As for the &#34;Q&#34;, it&#39;s a &#34;Q&#34;
    alright! I really like the structure and form. But the tail seems to be pulling
    it leftward/clockwise a bit. The &#34;R&#34;&#39;s leg seems a bit too strong
    - but maybe I&#39;m being to &#34;rationalist&#34;. I think the &#34;Y&#34; definitely
    needs a bigger torso. As for the &#34;Z&#34;, it looks a bit too sharp - maybe
    treat the corners like you did in the numeral &#34;4&#34; &#40;same for the lc
    &#34;z&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Numerals: The &#34;3&#34; is just wow. The zero is
    great, but maybe a little light &#40;on purpose?&#41;. BTW, all the numerals seem
    to have a little too much stroke contrast. I think your BP is cool, but maybe
    too big with OS nums. <BR> <BR>And in terms of proportions: I think your ascenders
    are not long enough in relation to the descenders. <BR> <BR>Please don&#39;t take
    this critique harshly - you have something amazing here, make no mistake. Go all
    the way with it. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    work.  <BR> <BR>Just out of curiousity..how many hours &#40;approx.&#41; have

    &#39;e&#39; also bugs me...the horisontal bar should be lowered to balance the

    can be discussed about a typeface that is so close to being finished &#40;relatively

    of what youve been thinking with your &#34;experimental&#34; ligatures in the

    Upto a point &#40;which is essentially determined by the forms, not the spacing&#41;,
    the narrower a word the better, in two ways: more words fit in the field of vision
    during reading; more words fit in the line/page/etc. <BR> <BR>Also, I can offer
    examples. I can&#39;t think of a text face that has too-tight spacing &#40;Helvetica&#39;s
    too tight, but it&#39;s not really a text&#41;, but I can mention two fonts that

    kerning, so &#34;AV&#34; might still have a slight negative kern, for example&#41;.

    But let me echo all the praise that&#39;s come before.  I really like what you&#39;ve
    created here. In some ways TyPress reminds me of some of the things I was exploring
    in my Whitman typeface, but built on more of an oldstyle model &#40;in contrast
    to Whitman&#39;s Transitional and Scotch forebears&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is a handsome
    face, and it sounds like you&#39;re well on your way to completing the design.
    If you&#39;re open to a few more comments, however, here are a couple of observations
    I had. <BR> <BR>This may be the fault of the flash specimen, but it looks to me
    like your lc &#39;v&#39; is floating a bit on the line -- in words like &#39;advertisement&#39;
    and &#39;approved&#39;. Check the original to see if maybe you shouldn&#39;t extend
    the overshoot down a bit. If you&#39;ve trimmed the vertex to the baseline, then
    I would try dropping to half the overshoot. If it&#39;s already below the baseline,
    I&#39;d try going to the full value of the round overshoots. <BR> <BR>Again perhaps
    an artifact of the flash file, but the counter in your lc &#39;d&#39; seems a
    little large to me. Although I see what you&#39;re after with the horizontality
    of the top join, you might want to let that inside curve drop a little more as
    it joins the stem. <BR> <BR>Finally, this may simply be a matter of taste, but
    I don&#39;t care for the chamfer at the top of lc &#39;t&#39;. I think the effect
    is perfect in places like the beak of the &#39;a&#39; or the terminal of the &#39;y&#39;.
    But here it serves to round out the top in a way that seems at odds with the crisp
    character of other, similar details. I would go for a compromise between your
    original, sharp version and this. Instead of an angled chamfer at the tip, I would
    try clipping the tip with a horizontal. <BR> <BR>These are just picky little things.
    Overall a handsome design. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. '

    Giving typographers and designers variety and also the opportunity to make the
    text readable &#40;and legible&#41; is very important. But, I can see where an
    uninformed designer &#40;like myself&#41; might use the face incorrectly. Maybe
    I was thinking of display purposes and not text. Guilty as charged. ;-p <BR> <BR>And
    yes. Morison did give us that.

    I am still a disputal of the theories about type I learned. Those are the ones
    of Gerrit Noordzij. &#40;According to his theory, my Italic is a bastard, having
    its way of building somewhere between roman and &#39;real&#39; italic&#41; Noordzij
    has tried to differ between roman and Italic by analysing the way one would write
    them. So one can say there is immence difference between Roman and Italic. <BR>
    <BR>I think we have here a discussion about theory, not about my typeface. <BR>
    <BR>I decided to make my italic a &#39;bastard&#39; Italic, not only because I
    like it, but also because i was inspired by 16th and 17th century type. Then they
    designed Italic to be used with roman faces, but still they were seperate designs.
    Combined with theory of type of G. Noordzij.  <BR> <BR>I have personaly my difficulties

  body: ' &#62; Gerrit Noordzij <BR> <BR>I admire Noordzij in many ways, both inside
    and outside of type design. His &#34;Letterletter&#34; I enjoyed very much, even
    though I disagree with its basic premise: when it comes to Noordzij&#39;s blind
    love of the hand, I think he&#39;s completely wrong - and I&#39;m not the only
    one. As Paul Stiff writes in Typography Papers #4: &#34;Gerrit is confident that
    once we understand writing, we will understand typography. Here he is quite wrong:
    we will not understand typography until we understand reading.&#34; We no longer
    read handwriting. Let the doddering old man rest in peace, instead of trying to
    teach it the lambada. <BR> <BR>---- <BR> <BR>Functionally, in a text face, italics
    is about slant, and &#42;not&#42; &#34;ductus&#34;. The simple reason is that
    immersive reading cannot always pick up too-subtle variations - it needs a discernible
    contrast in structure &#40;or alternatively color, which is actually my personal
    preference&#41;, and this is provided by the slant. You need the slant&#42;, the
    rest is a matter of two things: the designer&#39;s personal taste &#40;which is
    often given way too much importance&#42;&#42;&#41;, and functionalism &#40;see
    below&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; A good example of this is the italic of Seria: Majoor
    has made a font which is very beautiful, but because it has almost no slant it
    doesn&#39;t really work 100%. Small example: the UC &#34;I&#34; &#40;common in
    English&#41; is nearly impossible to decipher as italics. Note that he has a second
    -more slanted- italics for Seria, but I&#39;m not sure when/where it&#39;s coming
    out. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Deep down this is a dispute between Art and Craft, and
    I&#39;m personally tired of the huge exageration of the former in contemporary
    design. <BR> <BR>&#62; do you really think obliqued type is more readeable than
    Italics?  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s mostly a question of familiarity, specifically with
    boumas &#40;word shapes&#41;: the closer  an italic is to the roman, the more
    readable it is - that should be beyond dispute. Not just in making the structures
    the same, but also in making the slant small. But of course you &#42;still&#42;
    need a discernible slant, and the smaller you make it the more you have to use
    color, width and apparent size to compensate. <BR> <BR>So, for example, the descending
    &#34;f&#34; is bad for reading: it creates confusion in our bouma decipherment.
    However, pure readability doesn&#39;t exist - it has to be balanced against aesthetics.
    To see what kind of balance I personally consider ideal &#40;at least at this
    point in time&#41;, look at Patria, where in places I&#39;ve sacrificed boumas
    for aesthetic effect - but also differentiation, like the lc &#34;a&#34;, which
    is a common single-letter word in English &#40;&#34;I said I wanted &#42;a&#42;
    dog.&#34;&#41;, and being short it&#39;s very likely to be deciphered through
    the blurry parafovea, so it needs extra help. <BR> <BR>hhp '
