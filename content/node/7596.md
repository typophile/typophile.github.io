body: 'Hello. This is my first stab at font building. It is not an original design,
  but my attempt at recreating the fonts found in the <i>Oeuvres de Descartes</i>
  series published by J. Vrin in the 1970s. It was pointed out to me by someone named
  Claude on a fonts newsgroup that the Titling capitals were derived from the work
  of Louis Perrin &#40;The Lyons Capitals&#41;. If any one has any additional information
  on these fonts or any critique of how to improve the design, I would really appreciate
  it! Some of the glyphs &#40;like the italic `k&#39;&#41; I could not find in the
  book, and I am not quite sure how to make it fit with the other letters. Also, I
  know that the Italic caps are butt ugly, because I haven&#39;t been much interested
  in improving them &#40;they rarely come up in use for me&#41;. But I&#39;d still
  appreciate suggestions on them. You people seem to know a lot about good typography!

    <BR> <BR>Hrant and Jean, thanks so much for the input! I have put together a page
    of scans as well as a link to the PDF that is a bit updated &#40;I noticed a few
    details that needed to be changed&#41;. It is interesting that you describe these
    kinds of fonts as being a bit wunky, which is what initially inspired me to make
    them. I like escpecially the narrow top on the e and c, as well as the backward
    slope of the b, the lovely g, etc. But especially I love the Capital R. <BR> <BR>The
    first time I saw the titling font was on the cover of <i>Pensees Diverses sur
    la Comete.</i> I noticed the spine while browsing through the philosophy books
    at school. I just absolutely loved these letters, especially the capital R. The
    cover of this book is what first got me interested in typography last winter!
    <BR> <BR>In the same section I found the series on Descartes, which is quite an
    important resource for Descartes scholars. The editions definitely look like they
    were produced photographically to me and contains many different fonts. One of
    the problems in identifying the fonts is that there are so many different ones
    used in the series.  <BR> <BR>I chose to work from Tome Six, since this is the
    cleanest copy we have. I based the font off the largest of the type, which is
    about 14pt. The original&#39;s italic has a noticeably lower x-height than the
    regular; I kept it lower but not as much as in the original.  <BR> <BR>The font
    in the introduction and in the footnotes is different than the main body text,
    but I did not reference this in the design &#40;in fact the small fonts seem to
    resemble very much JFP&#39;s <i>Bertrand</i>&#41;. Also, the small caps do not
    seem to be based on the capitals, but are possibly from another typeface. I decided
    to retain their flavour anyway. The original numerals are very ugly, and I tried
    to make them prettier &#40;this is where I made the most change&#41;. <BR> <BR>Interestingly,
    the italics used at different sizes all seem to be the same design, but drawn
    slightly differently. For example, the smaller ones are curvier, while the stems
    on the full size are straighter. <BR> <BR>I hope that we can achieve a correct
    identification so that it can be named properly and I can learn more of the history
    of the designs. I would like to look at those books that you recommended, Hrant,
    but they are typography books are not available here in Winnipeg. Hopefully I
    will be able to buy some books at some point, but they are generally prohibitively
    expensive &#40;I am a philosophy student&#41;. If you can post any scans from
    your books I would really appreciate it!

    Your scan of <i>The Beaudoire from Ovink</i> is exactly the same one in the book,
    numerals and all. In my book there are the same 11pt and the same 14pt. The only
    differences are that in the Descartes books the lc <b>a</b>, <b>c</b> and <b>s</b>
    in the 14pt size are different. I guess Floch &#40;who printed the book&#41; made
    his own? <BR> <BR>Googling `ovink beaudoire&#39; turns up nothing useful. Can
    you suggest to me where I can get access to this book? Is it purchase-able? I
    am so happy, because I have been wanting to know the story of these designs since
    I first saw this book.

    was the one who <cite>knew</cite> stuff.  But I'm glad I could help.\r\n\r\nThe
    Ovink thing is a 3-part article titled \"Nineteenth-century reactions against
    the didone type model\", published in the Dutch journal Qu\xE6rendo - a really
    useful series. The Beaudoire bit is in part 2. I don't seem to have kept an exact
    reference for that, but fishing through some old emails I can see that part <cite>three</cite>
    is in V2 #2 (1972). If you have trouble finding it, try to find an index to Qu\xE6rendo
    (I know they published indeces, plus it might be online), or look through the
    complete Ovink bibliography in Quaerendo Volume 14 #1 (1984), pp 8-17. If you
    <cite>still</cite> can't find it, let me know.\r\n\r\nSo are you trying to find
    a good name for the font? It's tricky, because Beaudoire's work* was apparently
    derivative to some extent. But I wouldn't call it Perrin [any more]. The only
    thing I can think of is \"Th\xE9ophile\". Or maybe something related to mid/late-19th
    century France.\r\n\r\n* At least that design; there's actually a font in Audin
    '28 by Beaudoire that's a quite charming upright cursive - even though Audin himself
    calls it \"bien laide\" (quite ugly).\r\n\r\nBTW, check <cite>this</cite> out:\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/familytree.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/familytree.html</a>\r\nBut
    looking through my stuff, that \"g\" -and the lc in general- makes it look closer
    to the \"Old Style\" of Miller & Richard of Edinburgh (an \"Anglo\" take on the
    Elzevir) than the French stuff. And tellingly, the same guy who made Romana made

    of works, and some great facsimiles &#40;as well as actual prints -like pressmarks-
    from Perrin&#39;s own engravings&#41;. The paper is very yellowed though. There
    are two things in there that will probably interesting you most: <BR> <BR>1&#41;

  body: 'Thanks for the critiques. Right now I am on a holiday and so I cannot work
    on the design. But I will definitely make a list of the suggestions and try their
    implementation when I get home. <BR> <BR>Foremost will be the spacing and kerning
    of the characters. I have been meaning to redo this entirely, since I figured
    how to achieve better spacing with less kerning while making the italic; but this
    will be a big task for the number of glyphs in the roman &#40;regular, sc, titling,
    accents...&#41;. I didn&#39;t notice before how wide the spacing on the `t&#39;
    is, so any more comments about spacing woulr be great. It is hard to tell what
    is off after I have become so used to the spacing. <BR> <BR>Looking at the `Q&#39;,
    I can see what you mean about the tail being too frail. Sometimes I was unsure
    about whether to follow the perrin, beaudoire or version from Les Oevres de Descartes
    most closely. But I from now on I will try to just balance out the family over
    all. <BR> <BR>Jon: The lc `s&#39;, c e and a are based on the ones in Oevres de
    Descartes, which are somewhat different than all the others. I think that they
    look much better anyway, especially the s which matches more nicely to the uc
    `S.&#39; But having ball terminals does match better with the italic; which do
    you think looks better in the roman?  <BR> <BR>Re: the asterisk, I wish that I
    could take credit for this, but it is exactly the one in Oevres de Descartes.
    It is one of my favorite glyphs from there since it is different from most. But
    thanks about the dagger and the BP glyph. Those are ones I actually did make.
    <BR> <BR>My descenders on <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> from the italic are actually a
    bit shorter than from the orinigal ones. I know that they do not blend perfectly
    with the roman for this reason, but in the original the two were never set on
    the same line. When I did make them shorter, I felt that a lost of their distinct
    character was lost. When I get back I will try making it with shorter descenders
    on those glyphs and you guys can tell me what you think. <BR> <BR>Hrant: I do
    not know exactly what you mean about the top of the t being out of character.
    Can you elaborate? Do you mean that the sloped part should be more curvy than
    it is now?'

    these are characteristics that you&#39;re bringing from the original typeface,

    is the lowercase r

    name: nepenthe
    picture: 109675
  body: Forrest,  <BR> <BR>Thanks very much for the insights. I actually kind of like
    the steep angle on the r, but I will take a look at it and try to improve it.
    The square brackets are indeed too thin. I have not edited them in a long time
    and since I made them the rest of the font has become darker and more consistent.
    So I did revise these to still be thin, but now more in proportion to the rest.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, good points about the italic. I&#39;ve been hating the lc k for some
    time now, but wasn&#39;t sure what to do with it. I recently came across a book
    that was set in Fournier, and seeing how similar it is Marquet in many ways, I
    decided to adopt a similar style. There was no lc k in the original, so finding
    this was helpful. I also modified the uc K to be more similar to the R and Q as
    well. Regarding the y, you are quite right. I would say that overall the spacing
    on the italic is not very good because I just haven&#39;t had the time to do enough
    work on it. I find that the cursive was easier to draw but more difficult to space!
    <BR> <BR>After much thought, I also decided to revise the ascenders and descenders
    to be a bit more conservative. I am still a bit uncomfortable with the ascenders
    of the longs glyphs, so I will change them to be shaped more like the r. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m also working on expanding the titling set to include a lc that is
    sort of a blend of the Beaudoire lc and one by Perrin that matches his Titling
    figures more closely. I will post that in the Display section when more is done.
    It looks very French!

    never seen anything like them, but they aren&#39;t so mannered they draw undue
    attention to themselves. They are also, after looking around, incredibly French.
    That said, a little reflection tells me you need to work on the upper right curve
    on the R some more; it looks a little squashed. <BR> <BR>Keep working on this
    one! I really like it!

    BORDER=0> The R from this design was what got me interested in typography. I have
    spent countless hours on the titling caps trying to achieve maximum hotness and
    I really don&#39;t think that I can change any of them for the better at this
    point without disrupting the orignal character.  But I can see that the part you
    mention declines more swiftly than its P counterpart. I will revisit this letter
    as I continue to work the display set. I am more sure now that I will want keep
    these as a separate font altogether rather than put them in the main font as a
    Titling alternate. <BR> <BR>I am also continually bothered by the italic even
    after having fixed the k, descenders, etc. That is primarily why I haven&#39;t
    posted any more updates. Lately I have been working on rewriting the opentype
    code to make it more elegant and to allow for more comprehensive kerning classes
    on the roman. Once it is figured out how to do this properly, I will apply the
    same methods to the Italic. And if anybody can tell me how to fix the ugly w,
    please let me know! <BR> <BR>BTW, Thomas, if you read this, thanks again for posting
    those OpenType feature files on the Adobe site. I am just in awe of how perfect

  body: I think the w and the v are both fine. I had to search through your Hume paper
    &#40;what did your professor think of the over-the-top typography, by the way?&#41;
    to find the italic w in a setting, but there it made perfect sense. I think in
    general this face could stand to be letterspaced a little more loosely, and if
    so, you could widen the italics a little and lower the contrast. I think my objections
    to the y would diminish with a little outward curvature in the descender coupled
    with a thicker stroke. <BR> <BR>I think the italics would be easier to space if
    the overall letter spacing were looser, too. One of the things I&#39;ve been learning
    lately is that we &#40;contemporary users and designers of type&#41; like to bunch
    our letters up much more tightly than in the past; if this is a revival typeface
    &#40;which it still kind of is&#41;, maybe you should try revival spacing as well.
