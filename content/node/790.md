  body: I&#39;m planning on going. Provided I don&#39;t need a root canal or heart
    transplant or encounter some other money-draining emergency between now and then.
    Since my travel budget for this year is rapidly dwindling, I&#39;m staying at
    the Global Backpackers Hostel. &#40;If anyone else is strapped for hotel cash,
    I&#39;ve stayed at the GBH in Toronto and, while it&#39;s not 4-star by any stretch,
    it&#39;s decent and only $25 a night :-&#41; I&#39;m actually planning on staying
    for a few days after the conference, since it falls right on my Fall holidays.
    If there are any Vancouver natives who know of interesting ways to kill time,
    I&#39;d be grateful for the knowledge.

  body: Meredith and David, yes we&#39;re aware that the conference is scheduled during
    Rosh Hashanah. This is very unfortunate but was unavoidable due to the availability
    of the conference venue. The next available dates were well into October, and
    there was nothing available earlier. A decision was made, on this basis, by the
    former ATypI executive director; I think she made the right decision, despite
    that fact that it has made it impossible for some people to attend, including
    a couple of prospective speakers. The only options -- rescheduling the conferences
    later than usual or opting for a less suitable venue -- would have inconvenienced
    a greater number of people. I should note that one Jewish speaker, Martin Mendelsberg,
    will still be attending and speaking because I have scheduled him on the Sunday
    afternoon &#40;which is also when my own presentation on Hebrew type design takes
    place&#41;. I&#39;ve provided Martin with a list of Vancouver synagogues, so he
    can spend Saturday in observance of Rosh Hashanah, and would be happy to provide
    similar information to anyone else. <BR> <BR>ATypI is very much aware that this
    needs to be avoided in future. We were not expecting conference space in Vancouver
    to be so heavily booked so far in advance.

    or something, so I got to do it on the cheap. <BR> <BR>The funny part is that
    we are in the process of buying a house on Saltspring Island, 1.5 hours away from
    Vancouver by ferry. If it were a little closer, I&#39;d stay at the new house.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to try to stay up there all week. <BR> <BR>Oh, hot-diggedy!
    Now I have to decide what I&#39;m going to not miss!

    I believe the good folk at Text Matters are working on a table of some kind, so
    that it will be easy to see overall structure. Most of the time there will be
    three tracks in progress.

    with incorrect dates for three important Holidays. Please accept our sincerest
    apologies for these errors and note the following corrections: <BR>[...]  <BR>
    In addition, we also wish to apologize for having listed Yom Kippur as one of
    our &#34;Reasons To Party&#34;. We understand and respect that Yom Kippur is a
    Day of Atonement, a day to be taken seriously to reflect and fast, and as such,
    one of the most important Jewish Holidays in the year. <BR>  <BR>&#34;Again we

    is why everyone should get out onto Denman and Robson, even for breakfast. By
    the way, anyone looking for really good coffee within four blocks of the hotel
    should try Cicco del Oriente, on Robson between Cardero and Nicola. Very small
    but good. It&#39;s an odd hybrid of Italian and Japanese coffee and ice cream
    culture, resulting in things like black sesame gelato.
