  Hische, this sample grabbed from one of Hische's pieces. Similar to Blair MD ITC,
  but the E and R are different. Any idea?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks! The tail on the R is different than Engravers Gothic, but the rest
    is pretty dang close. Hische being a letterer, though, it could very well be custom.
