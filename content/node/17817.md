  body: "Hahahahahaha, thanks for your concern and the explanation, Chris. I didn't
    know the word sleuth and thought it was related to <em>sloth,</em> meaning we
    had no lives and just hung around the Type ID Board waiting for some identification
    request to bring some variation in our dreary existence. Shows how little I know.
    :-D\r\n\r\nBTW Randy and I know each other well enough to allow for \"smiley-less\"
    friendly insults. ;-)"
