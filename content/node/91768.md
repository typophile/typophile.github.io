body: "I'm a beginner in Typography (Inkscape and FontForge on Win7x32).  \r\n\r\nI
  try to explain my answer with an example: \r\n<strong>I like to use the existing
  OFL font family \"PT Sans\"</strong> with different styles/weights and also Condensed/Extended
  variants <strong>for charts and drawings in a project</strong>. But this font-family
  (like any other good text font) <strong>misses some Unicode symbol chars</strong>
  (from Unicode-Block Dingbats, Miscellaneous Symbols, etc.) that I need. \r\nWindows
  seems to automatically use sometimes weird fallback chars, coming from the installed
  fonts with extended Unicode support (Segoe UI Symbol, Arial Unicode MS, DejaVu Sans,
  etc.). Office/Word (Uniscribe?), MS IE (first Uniscribe, now DirectWrite), Firefox
  (first Uniscribe, now DirectWrite), Chrome (Uniscribe) seem to have sometimes different
  implementations of this \"<strong>font fallback mechanism</strong>\". I was unable
  to find enough information to understand this OS and software behaviour. I'm especially
  interested if it is possible to edit this mechanism, for example to prescribe the
  usage of the preferred Unicode font. This would be generally interesting also by
  using fonts like Linux Liberation/Biolinum. Here some links: \r\n[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallback_font|Wikipedia:
  Fallback font]]\r\n[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniscribe|Wikipedia: Uniscribe]]\r\n[[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374105%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|MS

  Making font initialization lazier]]\r\n[[http://maxradi.us/documents/uniscribe/|Brett
  Wilson (Google Chrome Dev) / Uniscribe: The Missing Documentation & Examples]]\r\n\r\nI
  think I have two options: \r\nA) use the PT Sans fonts and modify/extend them with
  the risk to have to integrate future releases and to make errors as a beginner\r\nB)
  create a new font with the PT Sans metrics and only the desired Unicode symbols.
  But the technical background and the fluid usage in texting/graphical software is
  not clear to me (without the need to change font family for certain characters in
  the text). \r\n\r\n<strong>Is there more information about the Font fallback mechanism
  with rare Unicode characters in Windows, especially whether this behavior can be
  influenced?</strong> \r\n\r\nI hope my question is clear enough and someone here
  can extend my knowledge about this complex behaviour. Thank you. "

    enough. \r\n\r\n@oldnick: Option B is not a re-creation of the standard characters:
    only some of the desired characters mainly in Symbol Unicode blocks should be
    created and integrated. <strong>The core of my question is about the Windows Font
    fallback mechanism with Unicode characters. I have rewritten my question in the
    first post. </strong> If I don't get enough information about that, I don't feel
    to decide what to do. Maybe I have to ask in some programmers/Windows GUI Forum?"

  body: "I'm not quite sure what you're looking for here.  All browsers implement
    the same basic algorithm for fallback within fonts in a given fontlist.  If you
    specify <code>font-family: FontA, FontB, sans-serif;</code>, then all browsers
    will first test FontA for a given character, then FontB, etc.  If <strong>system</strong>
    fallback occurs (i.e. none of the fonts in your specified fontlist contain a glyph
    for a given character), then the behavior will vary across browsers.  Chrome used
    a hard-coded fallback list, IE uses an OS-level fallback routine and Firefox uses
    a hybrid approach.  But if your goal is to always see a given set of symbols,
    make a font containing those symbols and include it in your font list.  In that
    case, fallback will be consistent across browsers.\r\n\r\nJohn Daggett\r\nMozilla
