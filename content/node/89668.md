  to replicate this logo exactly as a practice.\r\nI've tried the Extrude and Bevel
  3D effect after adding the fill gradients to the objects, but I can't manage to
  get the gradient fill on the edges.\r\n\r\nAny other procedure and help is appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/muy_buenos_dias_5474.jpg]"

  body: 5star, I looked at all the links, tried to do the effect, but haven't had

  body: "I first used the blue gradient, then feathered. After that I applied the
    extrude and bevel, but I can't get it to have a thicker edge.\r\n\r\nI don't know
    if that's the way 5star did it.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture1_5935.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture3_4324.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture4_5398.JPG]"

  body: Forget extrude and bevel.  Just one flat object with a gradient under a copy
    of the object with a slightly different gradient and a feathered edge.  No stroke
    or other effects on either object.

  body: "Thanks Luma Vine, now I understand how 5star did it. I tried it and it works
    great. But after playing around a while I managed to do it with the 3D Extrude
    and Bevel options, expanding, compounding path, deleting... I forgot how, ha ha.
    Gonna try and do it again. This time I'll write it down.\r\nThanks for everything
    guys.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/result_4717.JPG]"
