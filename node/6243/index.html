We like to think of ourselves as secretive, very secretive, in fact the name of the studio is one no one, not even long-standing clients remember or can spell. Anywho, point is we're not into navel-gazing, and took our site down after we noticed a familiar IP # snooping around the portfolio and  informative strategy pages we had with messaging matrix tables, ect. days before a major proposal was due in town. We already knew they were bidding and found it suspicious. <BR> <BR>Perhaps one should ask how often do you check out your peers as well.</div>

In most cases, one gets jobs through footwork and personal connections.  A lot of successful design firms don't even have websites up. <BR> <BR>I'm talking about regular graphic design of course, and not type design. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yes I agree with Keith. <BR> <BR>my point before being that an online representation of design work (unless its web design) seems like fluff to the entire basis and background of the internet. Sure yes, some people are bound to it. I was one of them during my telecommuting stint&hellip;but I don't need a site for that. <BR> <BR>I donno, I'm starting to hate the net more and more because people are proliferating it with junk. I don't think a design portfolio belongs on the net , its a matter of relevance (yes I'm a hypocrite and have one, its very old, never seen and coming down)&hellip;but unless your offering those pictures in part with Case studies/forums or experiments, there's hardly a point. A liability&hellip;.umm I'm sure it depends what business your in and where. <BR> <BR>I guess my analogy here is that a commercial site seems like what a commercial is to television, and they just keep playing more and more and interrupt the show more frequently. Its cheap. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some interesting points. Yes, the web has moved  <BR>beyond the brochure-ware of 1997 era sites. <BR> <BR>But why would you question a design portfolio on the  <BR>web? I've landed many job interviews from my personal  <BR>site. It doesn't replace a physical portfolio, but it's been  <BR>invaluable. No, nobody goes to my site on their own  <BR>and says, 'we want to interview you.' It's me sending an  <BR>email cover letter and finishing it with a URL. In the end,  <BR>it's a fairly easy way to 'prequalify.' <BR> <BR>Further, why would you question a designers motives  <BR>for wanting to create a great site &ndash; even if the  <BR>underlying motive is to one-up his/her peers? It's not  <BR>about showing off. It's about getting noticed; the same  <BR>reasons we have design contests.
