body: "I've just purchased a new computer and am in the process of migrating everything
  over. The Mac Migration Assistant moved my FontExplorerX app over, but the sets
  and everything in the library seems to have disappeared. Maybe that's because I
  don't have Explorer managing my fonts, but is there any way to export the set/library
  information? Do I really have to go build all my custom sets and import all my fonts
  all over again?\r\n\r\nI'm using v1.2.3 but would consider moving to Pro if there's
  a solution there.\r\n\r\nThanks."
