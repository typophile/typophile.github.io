body: Does anyone know what exactly the &#34;Dfr&#34; stands for, that is affixed
  to the names of the alternate versions of many, if not most, blackletter fonts &#40;eg.
  Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch, Goudy Text et al.&#41;? <BR> <BR>My guess is something
  like &#34;Deutsch Fraktur&#34;, because these versions seem to have the long s required
  for authentic old-time German as well as Umlaut versions of A, O and U. <BR> <BR>But
  then, knowing beats guessing, so if anyone knows for sure, I&#39;d be most grateful.

  body: Exactly right, Hadj. &#34;Deutsche Fraktur&#34; is a standard encoding that
    replaces the Latin s with the long s &#40;and puts the Latin s where the asterisk
    would go&#41;, as well as replacing some punctuation marks with particular ligatures.
