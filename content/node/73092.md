  body: "After looking at everything I could find that was calligraphic I think this
    looks more like Arthur Baker's work than anyone else I could see. However, I could
    not find an exact match anywhere at MyFonts. Pretty close were <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-matador/\">P22
    Matador</a>, New Amigo, Duckweed and Oakgraphic (all at MyFonts, I got lazy making
    links). The only pretty close non-Baker font I found was <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/waters-titling-mm/\">Waters
    Titling</a>, especially the condensed version.\r\n\r\nIf Bert's right about being
    able to do this with autotracing, then I would say Waters Titling might be my
    candidate, but in terms of actual fonts, Baker's work seems much closer in most
    stylistic details. It would be easy to believe this was a new Baker font.\r\n\r\n-
