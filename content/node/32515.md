body: "hello!\r\ni'm designing this new logo for caldea, an asiatic textile import/export
  italian factory; they ask me for something warm and something that remembers home
  (the textile they import is almost for house uses.)\r\n\r\nthis is the solution
  i gave and they liked it, but they want it to be more similar to textile...do you
  have any suggestion?\r\n\r\nand also, they ask me if i could use the logo as a part
  of the name, instead of the last \"a\". do you think it could be better o could
  work better?\r\n\r\nany other suggestion, comment and critique is apprecieted!![img:sites/default/files/old-images/caldea004_3835.png]"

  body: 'I''m by no means qualified to critique this, but I can say that as a viewer/reader,
    I find the mixture of lower case characters with the barless "A" characters difficult
    to deal with. I guess my brain is making the quick assumption that all the letters
    are lower case, and I interpret the "A"s as "n"s. I can also say that I do find
    the colours and serifs feel warm (I guess fitting with the thermal connotations
    of the name) and mature. '

  body: 'What about a version in which you use the last cap A from the word cAldeA
    similar to the logo and get rid of the additional A. Keep the red color. Somehow
    the crossbar from the cap A feels missing, I would try to give a little hint of
    the crossbar. '
