body: "I am working on a logo for a piece of hardware that works as a fall safety
  device. The product was developed by a home building firm to meet specific code
  regulations and they are now testing the market to see if it may be something that
  could be sold to mothers of young children and insurance agencies through a mostly
  online marketing campaign. The device works by being attached to the track of your
  window and will prevent the window from opening more than four inches...in case
  of an emergency it can be easily be removed by pushing down on it. They are calling
  it the Window Warden.\r\n\r\nThe first proof of logo concepts that I emailed to
  them is in the pdf folder. I was disheartened when they returned that email asking
  my opinion on the below jpg file (1.jpg) According to my client, \"One of the guys
  involved in the project, had a friend draw something up\" and they want my opinion
  on it. How do I make them understand why what their friend drew up is poor design
  and lead them towards a quality logo.\r\n\r\nAny feed back on my logo concepts (windowwarden.pdf)
  or how to deal with a client who thinks that the 1.jpg file is a good design will
  be greatly appreciated.  "

    guy's image, he sees coolness, which is how he feels about his product.  When
    he looks at your design in comparison, he sees lameness.  At this point, he's
    not thinking about the finer points of what makes a good logo; he obviously hasn't
    considered what the other guy's image will look like when scaled down to one inch
    wide.\r\n\r\nAsk your client what he likes about the other guy's image.  Once
    you have a good idea of what it is, tactfully help him understand why that image
    is deficient.  Explain what makes a good logo in terms he can appreciate, and
    tell him that you can create a logo with the elements (or the spirit of the elements)
    he likes from the other image, and that you have the necessary experience and
    expertise to ensure that it will look good at all sizes where it will be used,
    in any medium where it will be printed, etc.  Emphasize that you will work with
    him until he's satisfied and that you are an expert and will save him from grief
    and embarrassment down the road.  Make him feel good about himself and about you."

  body: "I'd just scale down their \"friend\" design and show them that it won't work
    at small sizes, doesn't work without the fade/gradient, etc.\r\n\r\nAs far as
    your concepts, your type choices feel too friendly to me, solid and secure has
    me wanting a meaty, bold typeface. I understand you may want something somewhat
    friendly if you're going after a female audience but it can't be too soft. I don't
    see a lot of concept behind them other than playing a window form, what about
    the idea of a lock and window, maybe a gate or bars and a window, etc. Do some
    more exploring and see what you can come up with."

  body: "Tell them you had a friend (with no training in home building or product
    development) design a version of the Window Warden. And it's made of rubber bands
    and sticks.\r\n\r\nJokes aside, tell them your honest opinion is that the friend's
    design won't work. (for the reasons others mentioned above). Use this as an opportunity
    to educate them on logo design. Point out that a logo is a component of a product's
    or business's identity. The friend-designed logo is trying to do too much work
    with the shadow, stroked letterforms and the illustration.\r\n\r\nOf your concepts,
    2 and 3 work best for me. Continue pushing the ww combo idea in #2 to create an
    interesting mark that could stand alone. Perhaps this ww is reversed out of a
    shape. Try arranging \"Window Warden\" in different ways below or to the right
    of the mark.\r\n\r\nI agree with Chris that your type choice feels friendly (with
    the exception of #3 and maybe #1). I can't say for sure if that's bad. Depends
    on what this product looks like, where it will be sold/marketed and who the audience
    is. My guess is that you want the type to communicate secure, but not too serious.
    If you go too friendly people may lose confidence in what the product promises
    to perform. If you go too serious, people may feel that the product is too complicated
    and may fear it would be difficult to quickly disassemble in a hurry. Mostly subliminal,
    of course.\r\n\r\nDid you get a clear idea of the concepts your client wants communicated? "

    the project take a look at this image of the actual product.\r\n\r\nIt is really
    not a very exciting object...more something you would find on a rack at Home Depot.
    The client also was concerned with the word \"warden\" conjuring up images of
    unfriendly and restrictive officials. They definitely wanted to soften the blow
    of the harsh sounding title with a softer, kid friendly look and feel that, again,
    attracts women of young children.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_5780.jpg]"

    window warden (presuming they're keeping that name). As far as bad clients go,
    they tried to warn me at college but it's always a complete PITA!
