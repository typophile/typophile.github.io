  tried a few automated tools but no luck. The fact that the text is slanted probably
  doesn't help. But you can clearly see that many letters are 'uneven', like for the
  W and the X, the stems (if that's the correct term) are not the same length. I like
  that.\r\n\r\nYour help is really appreciated. Thanks!"

    'Browse Fonts > by Style > Animated" category.
