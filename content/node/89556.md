  - wants to be different than the crowd but still appropriate. First round. 5 versions

  body: "Of all those you present I like #3 the most. But I would change a few things:\r\n\r\n1.
    Position the symbol so the square inter-space would align with the vertical delimiter
    in logo text\r\n2. Align B to the right of the square so it connects with CP\r\n\r\nBut
    I also have a suggestion. Why don't you try doing something in Mondrian's way...
