body: "I have just stumbled onto Typophile. Where have I been all my life? What great
  forums and people and subject matters dear to my serifed heart. It is lovely to
  meet others equally afflicted by the alphabet. \r\nI hope you will visit my new
  letterform design site at http://www.iskradesign.com and the attendant blog, http://www.alphabetroadtrip.com.
  The first is the portfolio for my lettering and calligraphic design business,and
  the second is a more freewheeling mostly visual blog about signage, poetics and
  process. Alphabet Roadtrip has a section called Signs I Like for which I am soliciting
  contributions. I'm looking for the naive, the quirky,and the painfully executed.
  And a story. Google has rendered information useless without story, and Flickr has
  done the same for imagery. Go see, and you'll see. Hope to hear.\r\n\r\nIskra\r\n\r\n\r\n

    web site, people will tend to hang around looking at it all, and will want to
    know more about how it came into being. A section with photos of your sketches
    and work in process would be a delightful addition."

    to be said for mystery....? The idea of the blog is that eventually it will have
    my library of favorite books on it as well as some case studies of projects breaking
    down the process. Thanks for looking!"
