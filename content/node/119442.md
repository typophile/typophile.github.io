body: "Hi all, whilst working on a current project, I have been supplied a logo lock-up
  which consists of a main mark and a strapline. The strapline is set on a curve to
  simulate a smile. My argument is that the text on a curve offers space, design and
  legibility issues and would sit better if it set on a horizontal line without compromising
  the design. I know that setting type in a curve throws up kerning issues with particular
  glyphs and ascenders, I wondered if anyone has a method/logic of showing why not
  to set text on a curve. I have worked a quick example up by blurring a curved and
  straight version which helps so glyph clashes to a degree, are there any other ways
  of showing the problems with setting words on a curve.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for any contributions/advice.\r\n\r\nD"
