body: "I'm working on a type rendering system that may be of use to people who make
  comic books. The system lets you personalize text for a variety of characters, and
  allows you to display subtle variations in individual words or letters that reflect
  characters' moods or speech patterns.\r\n\r\nThe system was designed for a random
  flash-based project of mine, but realizing that it might work in comic books too,
  I've decided to explore the possibility of making a standalone app designed for
  comic book lettering.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't know much about comic books, and I
  was hoping to talk to somebody in the industry about the workflow involved there,
  the needs of the medium, and see if this system might be of interest to people in
  the industry.\r\n\r\nI have a brief blurb about the system (including a very rough
  sample) at [[http://oogby.livejournal.com/209745.html]] if anybody's curious.\r\n\r\nIf
  anybody out there works in this industry, I'd love to pick your brain for a while,
  if you're up for it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Ooo, that was a great site! I, uh, actually went ahead and fired off a letter
    to its author. This project was in large part inspired by the work he did for
    Sandman, after all...
