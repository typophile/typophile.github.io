  body: ' hi mike, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if this will help you, but I&#39;ve got
    a keyboard from apple for the G4. &#40;it&#39;a a little compact keyboard&#41;
    The font what&#39;s been used for the typography of this keyboard has a great
    resemblance of the &#39;Univers Condensed Italic Light&#39;, according Berthold
    entitled no &#39;48&#39; &#40;you know the Univers got a system of numbers&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The difference is that the typeface of the keyboard is slightly less
    slanted than the original Univers. The numbers and capitals are almost exactly
    the same, the $, &sect; also. The &amp; is different, but I think apple made a
    few corrections to the typeface. It&#39;s probably used exclusively by Apple.
    <BR> <BR>But I don&#39;t know of your keyboard-type looks like the desktop-keyboard
    from the G4, but there might be a great change. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, when I&#39;m
    wrong, please try to upload a picture from the keys <BR> <BR>good luck <BR> <BR>M '

  body: ' Yeah Matt, Univers Condensed Italic Light seems to be the consensus. I can&#39;t
    see any difference between the two, but I am by no means an expert. I&#39;ll try
    to get a pic up soon. <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>-M- '
