      Brilliant observation, Sherlock.\r\n\r\nIt is also a font. Their letterhead
      and logo, etc, all have this font \r\nused.\r\n"

    <em>DUH!!! Brilliant observation, Sherlock.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat Nick meant is that
    often letters carved in stone -- and specifically this example -- are not based
    on fonts that are available digitally. This is custom lettering, not type."

  body: "[quote]This is custom lettering, not type.[/quote]\r\nI beg to differ, it
    may be a modified version of the fonts\r\nidentified but it was still a font before
    being LASER CARVED into \r\nthe stone. I have tocuhed the sign, myself, and it
    was not hand\r\ncarved, hence it had to be done by a computer, and thus digital
    fonts HAD to be used.\r\n\r\nThis is closed because I used Californian as it was
    extremely close, so, close that you can't tell unless it's blown up so large...\r\nI
    redid the logo in Illustrator and it looks great.\r\n"
