There&rsquo;s much there on Dwiggins. But if that&rsquo;s the reference, I can see it a bit, like here at the bottom of Prensa&rsquo;s italic /t/

<p>I gather Dwiggins arrived at this M-formula by paying special attention to the bits of the letters that get lost at small sizes or at a distance. I&rsquo;m not sure what printing process he would have been proofing with however.</p>
<p>I can kind of see the idea of wrapping the outside around the inside on the /g/ where the two closed counters seem to take their starting point from the middle counterspace, which is on the outside of the letter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the aspect that Cyrus was responding to, which he characterized as “wrapping outside curves around the inside,” is slightly different than what WAD was expressing with his M-formula memo. (Note: Dwiggins never used this “wrapping” language, not that I recall ever encountering in his letters anyway.)</p>
<p>It’s all generally related, of course, because Dwiggins was a multi-faceted thinker; but what Cyrus calls “tension” I believe Dwiggins would have referred as “snap” or “action.”</p>
<p>The thinking that lead to the M-formula memo only crystallized several years after Electra (and never found successful expression in any of his completed typefaces). I would say the M-formula is a subset of Dwiggins’s broader explorations of Action in type.</p>
<p>I’d have to go back to my files to find his letters discussing Action. I don’t think I have any of them transcribed.</p>
<p>But I’m preparing to travel tomorrow and in the middle of a big project, so I don’t have time to pursue right now. Sorry.</p>

<p>Maybe because in some cases the &ldquo;cut&rdquo; might imply a crossover from inside to outside?
