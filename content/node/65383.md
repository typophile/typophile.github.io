body: "Greetings.  I am on the hunt for the perfect typeface for LC library call numbers.
  \ I want a font which distinguishes very clearly between the most easily-confused
  characters (zero & O, 5 & S, 1 & I & J); is either a sans-serif or a serif of low
  stroke contrast; is simple and looks good in Bold; and -- ideally -- has oldstyle
  figures available.  A call number uses only capitals and numerals (e.g. JQ843.I17
  S56 2009) which implies lining, but I think oldstyle numerals help to make the letter/number
  distinction most obvious, especially the O/zero.\r\n\r\nRequiring bars on the I,
  and a sizeable angled tail on the 1, knocks out most sans-serif contenders.  Serif
  oldstyle 1's need a nice tail too (not bars).  Starting with basic Windows fonts,
  the best are Verdana/Tahoma and Bookman Old Style, but they have lining figures.
  \ Monospaced fonts offer a barred I, but generally have lining figures.  Constantia
  and Georgia are too high-contrast in boldface for my taste.\r\n\r\nMy favorite finds
  thus far are Quadraat Small Caps (offering uniformly short numerals, which are even
  better for this purpose than oldstyle), though stroke contrast is a bit high and
  the J isn't great; Droid Sans Pro (a great sans-serif, designed for legibility on
  mobile phones); and maybe Cooper, of all things (in Med or Bold), because of its
  unusual near-oldstyle numerals.  Do any fonts combine all the desired features?
  \ Numerals like those of Cooper or Quadraat SC might be best.  I suppose a zero
  that's both short and slashed is too much to hope for!\r\n\r\n"

    I assume these are what you mean by \xABnear-oldstyle\xBB \u2013 numerals that
    diverge vertically, but only by a bit; their \xABx-height\xBB is markedly larger
    than that of oldstyle numerals."

    of my most important criteria: bars on the capital I.\r\n\r\nI found a few more
    likely candidates: FF Tisa and FF Parango.  (The latter's numerals are a little
    wispy for signage & labels, but attractive for other uses.)\r\n"

  body: "Nina, Apex's alphabetics kill it for this task. The lc \"el\" in Tisa is
    too much like a numeral one. Parango has bigger problems... Unit is good - and
    the zero could be modified. Or you could use the o-slash. :-)  Axel looks like
    a winner as-is.\r\n\r\nHere's an idea: programming fonts! They're not the prettiest*
    but their glyphs are always highly differentiated. And there's a very handy one
    out there: Consolas! If you're on a Mac (or WinXP), Ascender sells it.\r\n\r\n*
    And would the fact that they're fixed-width be an issue here?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Good points on Apex. I stand corrected. I didn't actually look at the alphabetics
    too much \u2013 kinda got hooked on the idea of hybrid numerals.\r\n\r\nHow about
    something in the general direction of OCR fonts, BTW? Even less pretty than programming
    fonts, but the glyphs are certainly just about as differentiated as they can be."

  body: "Consolas I have, and it's certainly a possibility (and monospace is OK),
    though there are some things I don't like about it.  Programming fonts have indeed
    been used by libraries for call number labeling.  When I make simple things in
    Word, however, the Consolas alternate OS figures don't appear in the character
    map; why is that?  Does XP not fully utilize the Vista fonts?\r\n\r\nOCR fonts
    tend to look a little bizarre, and are probably trumped by other options.  Lowercase
    is almost irrelevant to my purpose, so Tisa is still a good choice.  Thanks for
    Axel, which is new to me.\r\n"

    think that would be because the OS figures are included as OpenType features and
    not as separate characters. You would need a OpenType-savvy program for this.
    Choosing OS figures is possible in MS Word 2010 Beta (which you can try out free
    for now), but I don't think older versions of Word include these or many other
    typographically useful OpenType features."
