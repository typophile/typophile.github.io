  body: "In fact I have to say that to me Muslimah is exactly a case of thinking that
    matching a typestyle across scripts is a matter of formal shapes. It's not. Instead
    I feel what's involved is the matching of a \"mood\": what Arabic font evokes
    to Arabs what Trajan evokes to Westerners? Maybe a thulooth. But that's hard to
    pull off with a font... So instead a particularly traditional Nasta'leeq perhaps.\r\n\r\nBTW
    Aziz, where do the outlines of the Latin component of Muslimah come from?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Trajan @ Muslimah  are complementary in ugliness!\r\n\r\n> Any other recommendations?\r\n\r\n@
    \ If the text is full with marks, I recommend (Naskh Aziz) that is now topping
    http://maryamsoft.com/\r\nBut if the text has no or little marks, I recommend
    the pressed version (Naskh Mostafa) \r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Jawi%20compare.pdf\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nHrant
