  someone will be able help me with this issue. We are working on a catalog and there
  is a portion of text that needs to be set in Vietnamese. When it is set some of
  the characters come up as blanks, I am guessing because the font does not have these
  characters. I need to set this one block of copy and would like to not buy a font
  for this. Are there any fonts that include these characters or free fonts I can
  download. Especially wanting something sans serif. Thanks in advance for any help.
  \r\n\r\nOk sorry, should have looked a little deeper first, found a goldmine in
  Arial's glyph palette.\r\n\r\n"
