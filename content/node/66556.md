  this]] at a relative''s house: a bound manuscript, text probably written in the
  18th century, containing some Christian prayers in Hebrew and the text of Psalms.
  Looks to have been written by a Jesuit missionary, probably as an exercise in learning
  biblical Hebrew. As a specimen of calligraphy it''s pretty abysmal, but it gives
  interesting insight into an outsider''s perception of the Hebrew alphabet. The way
  the author (or possibly authors) structure the letters is often different from what
  I grew up with. Note especially the Mem, Shin, Tet and Pey. Some of the characters
  (the Mem especially) afforded me a minor epiphany or two about their typographic
  forms vs. handwritten. Also, the Aleph occasionally gets some pseudo-calligraphic
  swashiness. '

  body: "Interesting -- as a piece of History. Not calligraphy.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't
    an exercise unless the scribe stated that. That said, the scribe will write a
    colophon where he states, when he wrote the copy, from where he got the copy etc
    etc .\r\n\r\nThe aim was to have a pocket book to carry with while traveling and
    such. Whoever wrote this book had  another MS in front of him! I really doubt
    that he knew the book of Psalms by heart.   "
