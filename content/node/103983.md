  time to post a question to the users here. I'm having some trouble finding the font
  I have in my mind.\r\n\r\nI'm designing a game with a retro feel in the genre of
  Evel Knievel.  Trying to plan out a couple cool fonts to use. One for title's more
  bold and one for small block text.  I thought this was a smart community to ask
  for some input. ;)\r\n\r\nSo far I've got Canadice, Funkydori, and Benuiat charisma.\r\n\r\nI
  appreciate any help or direction.\r\n\r\nCheers"
