  body: Thanks Wizard!  Yeah that gridnik looks like it...I really like alpha headline
    too now that i see that one.  For The Bookman font, it seems that that one is
    not italicized as it is usually shown in that Axe ad.  Perhaps there is another
    similar font?

  body: How about <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=415679">Bookman
    Swash Italic</a>?  It's definitely Bookman by that "y" character..
