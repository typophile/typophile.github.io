body: "This is the kind of miserable behaviour I . H A T E .\r\n\r\nI am to insert
  various PUA characters in the text, either via a customized keyboard or the glyph
  palette. In the case of *some* characters they only appear when getting typed if
  a certain other character or a space precedes it. E.g., one particular char. doesn\u2019t
  show up when I want to insert it just after a paranthesis. But ID seems then to
  insert some kind of dead character, which you notice when pressing the delete key.
  There is no OT fancies turned on. ID playes a game of cat-and-mouse with me and
  I don\u2019t see why.\r\n\r\nI have no clue about what I am doing wrong this time.\r\n\r\n\u2013
  it is not the font\r\n\u2013 it is not the keyboard driver (which works fine generally)\r\n\u2013
  no dead keys or combining sequences involved\r\n\u2013 all works perfectly well
  in TextEdit.\r\n\r\nHas anyone a clue to this?\r\n\r\n"

    play along well in this regard.

    the symptoms are similar to those of the headers here on typophile, where one
    non ascii glyphs not only isn't displayed, but \"eats\" one or more adjacent characters."

    re-started.\r\nSame thing.\r\n\r\nI trashed all instances of the font, re-started
    again and re-edited the font (its a .ttf).\r\nSame thing.\r\nWhile I\u2019m still
    testing in ID, the program crashes. Very odd.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve sent an Absturzbericht
    to Adobe now. Yes its that dark.\r\n\r\nI sorted out the ch.s belonging to plane
    1, those belonging to PUA. Much PUA ch.s in the very font behave totally normal.
    Some do not. \r\nI still don\u2019t understand what the problem can be. "

  body: "This may not be the issue, but it is always worth checking for possible conflicts
    between PUA usage by major software developers. For example, I note that at least
    some of the problem codepoints you list are used by Apple:\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/CORPCHAR.TXT\r\n\r\n<blockquote>#
    The block of 32 characters 0xF860-0xF87F is for transcoding hints.\r\n# These
    are used in combination with standard Unicode characters to force\r\n# them to
    be treated in a special way for mapping to other encodings;\r\n# they have no
    other effect.\r\n#\r\n# 0xF870-0xF87F are \"variant tags\" - they are like combining
    characters,\r\n# and can follow a standard Unicode (or a sequence consisting of
    a base\r\n# character and other combining characters) to tag it so that it will
    be\r\n# unique, treated in a special way for transcoding. These always terminate\r\n#
    a sequence of combining characters.\r\n#\r\n# 0xF860-0xF86B are \"grouping hints\"
    - they precede a group of two to\r\n# four standard Unicode characters to indicate
    that they are treated as a\r\n# group for transcoding. This grouping overrides
    any other combining\r\n# behavior.\r\n</blockquote>"

  body: "John, thanks a lot. This looks like the kind of hassle I was suspecting.\r\nIt
    was obvious that this is an ID handling fault.\r\nI already thought there might
    be only one option: to leave that part of the PUA.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still wonder:
    when Apple does use that area in that particular way, why do things run well in
    Apple\u2019s own TextEdit but not in Adobe InDesign? (Not that I would wonder
    about such a coalition between A. and A., but its neither very fair nor very clever.
    And not *private* at least.) "
