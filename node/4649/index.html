<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, <br>I am currently designing a logo for a fine dining restaurant named "Bellus" it is intended to have a bit a of a 1920's feel with influences of art nouveau. <br>These are my two logos.....help! <br>Any feed back and/or suggestions would be great. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35351.jpg alt="Bellus Logos"></div>

<div class=commentbody>You've got some nice illustrations there, Nathan. <br>Im digging the flowers most. <br> <br>I am finding the position of Bellus really uncomfortable notched under the floral design. <br>With such a complex mark, the placement of Bellus seems an afterthought. <br> <br>I see a pound sign and a couple of d's in the intersecting stems. Do you have a variation <br>with a B in it? My eyes do most of their travel in the winding lines. <br> <br>In the sihlouetted design, I dislike the long flowered strand. You have some odd angles in there. Also, I dont think you need it. You could attach the flower instead to a lengthened version of the curve under her chin. <br> <br>Bellus is very small also. Bring it up a bit. <br> <br>Andrew</div>

<div class=commentbody>I prefer the floral design also. I think the "d"s and the "#" that Andrew sees is a result of the intersecting curves being too alike. Art Nouveau is very free flowing, which you are beginning to capture, but I think you can push it a little more. The type is clean and is trying to portray sophistication (fine dining), but I don't think it's working well with the illustration. Bring the letterspacing in tighter and enlarge the letters. Have you looked at some other typefaces? <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the concept of the silhouette design, but think the implementation of the floral motif is much better. Even with the pound sign interference pattern. <br> <br>If you created a version of the floral patterns that formed a B, it would work nicely for me. <br> <br>As for the type, I think a general guide for size is to match the lineweight of the character with the stroke weight you used in the stem of the flower. Maybe a more indulgent, Baroque face would work better,</div>

<div class=commentbody>I too enjoy the floral design. But would like the floral stems simplified. Too much swing and dance going on. But use all the flower pieces you have. Just use one stem with it splitting towards the top flower, side flower and leaf. One leaf is adequate. <br> <br>Type will come easier when illustration is evolved. <br> <br>take care</div>

<div class=commentbody>The flower, and the purple, are great. I'd make the thorns bigger, at least some of them. <br> <br>Is that Skia, or Solpera? Although their "Greekness" might be inappropriate, the latter does have those wonderful "thorns"! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the flower & thorns. I don't <br>like the type, it does seem like <br>an unrelated afterthought. There <br>are some books in libraries that <br>have wonderful nouveau monograms <br>that would be worth checking out. <br>Try integrating the type with the <br>image, weave it in and out, mabe <br>it forms letters, maybe it is a large <br>capital B? Work it till it shines mate. <br> <br>kris.</div>
