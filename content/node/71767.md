  no good deed goes unpunished. His wife works for a doctor's office and they want
  to use their logo for a t-shirt; but all they have is an image embedded in a Microsoft
  Word document. Predictably, the t-shirt vendor is rejecting the artwork.\r\n\r\nSo
  since I'm their designer friend, they asked me for help \u2013 I don't know why
  the original designer couldn't be contact, but whatever. No good deed goes unpunished.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I've got the whole thing figured out except for what face the words \"Northern Arizona\"
  are in.\r\n\r\nCan you give me a hand?"
