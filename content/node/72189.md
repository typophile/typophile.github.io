  decorative font is based on Cyrillic Vyaz of XV-XVI centuries. This type of letters
  were used as display faces in sacred texts. In Vyaz, the letters are characteristically
  fitted to each other so the letter sequences look as one solid ornamental frieze.
  The font is rich in discretionary ligatures which help to accentuate the style of
  Vyaz. In addition to letters and standard characters there is a number of monograms
  and Christian symbols. These and other features are available in OTF format.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ascetic2D_720x360_02_6336.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ascetic2D_720x360_03_3757.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ascetic2D_720x360_04_3718.png]\r\n\r\n\r\non
