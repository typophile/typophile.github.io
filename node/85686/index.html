  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone has any insight about proper font licensing as it relates to cloud computing&hellip; Here&rsquo;s a brief explanation:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting a business where we are creating custom journals (Bound Custom Journals - [[www.boundforanything.com]]).  Some of the content that will go into a journal will be built on the fly on in an Amazon Web Services environment using ImageMagick.  Those pages - usually calendar pages which get generated based on the date range you choose - need to be able to access a font file in order to properly render out those files, which then get populated into a pdf and sent to the printer.</p>
<p>Most font licenses allow for a user to install a font on up to 5 machines, however because we&rsquo;re using AWS, during high traffic, that font may appear on more than 5 virtualized machines.  During low traffic, it may not appear on any machines - the servers will be individually spun up and down based on demand (thus the beauty of cloud services).</p>
<p>My question is - Is a normal font license sufficient for this kind of use?  Would love to hear anyone&rsquo;s thoughts on this&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Cheers,
Michael</p>

<p>This is far beyond the limits of a normal font license. Most font licenses explicitly cover a number of simultaneous users equal to the number of licenses you purchased. Additionally, What you are doing is effectively embedding the font into software, which is prohibited by most retail font licenses. You need to contact the font designers directly to negotiate a license compliant with your system.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info.  I wonder if we just restrict it to one cloud instance (and up the power instead of upping the number of instances), if that would keep the cost down.</p>
<p>Also, (thinking aloud here)
The issue of embedding into software is a weird one&hellip; I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.  I mean, it&rsquo;s no different than me using illustrator to create the final product, it&rsquo;s just a different tool using the font to create what is ultimately just a pdf to be printed&hellip;.</p>

<p>Setting the font up on a web server that makes it available to an unlimited number of users over the internet is very different from installing it on a single workstation that is accessed locally by a single user.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>None of our users will have access to the font file itself.  It is only used to build out files.</p>
<p>Let me explain a bit more -</p>
<p>When a user decides they want to get a calendar in our journal, they select for example a weekly calendar, and the date range.  When they order the journal, a script runs that builds out the custom preferences of that user.  All of our non-dynamic content (basically anything without a date attached to it) is pre-built pdfs that gets assembled into a 140pg pdf and sent to a printer.  Any dynamic content (weekly calendars, monthly calendars, daily) gets rendered on the fly based on the custom date range inputted by the user, using our QuickMagick script to place the right dates on each page.  The user never sees this happen, the font file is only referenced by the QuickMagick script, and the output is a pdf that gets printed.</p>
<p>The salient point here is that there is no way / no URL to go to that would let you download the font file.  It only lives on the file system of the server, and would only be accessible through admin ssh.</p>

<p>That is irrelevant. What is relevant is that your server allows users to select a font and design an object using that font. So you need to have a license for every one of those users.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The user does not get to choose.  The user doesn&rsquo;t get to specify anything about the design at all.</p>
<p>Think of it this way -</p>
<p>Scenario 1 - User wants to order a journal, so user goes to a site where he/she can buy a journal that has a 2012 monthly calendar in it, followed by regular old lined pages for the rest of the journal.  Some designer has created that monthly calendar, using fonts that are licensed on their home computer, and converted that into a pdf and sent it to a printer to be printed and bound into a journal for the user.  The user has &lsquo;selected&rsquo; to buy this journal because it has the exact date range they want - Jan 1 - Dec 31 2012.</p>
<p>Scenario 2 - User wants to order a journal, so user goes to a site where he/she can buy a journal that has a monthly calendar in which they can decide to start on Feb. 2, 2012 and end on July 2, 2012, followed by regular old lined pages for the rest of the journal.  Some designer has created the template for that monthly calendar, and run a script on another independent computer (not connected to the internet) to populate the monthly calendar with the appropriate numbers and month names, using a font that is licensed for that second computer, per the specific instructions in the code as specified by the designer.  That was then converted into a pdf, sent to a printer and bound into a journal for the user.</p>
<p>What is the difference here?</p>
<p>Sidenote - The reason I&rsquo;m arguing this is not because I think I&rsquo;m right - only because I want to get it right.  I have a deep respect for type designers and am more than happy to adhere to the licensing rights, but at the same time, I also need to balance the costs of doing so.</p>

<p>This is indeed a thorny issue. Probably the fairest way to price the license would be on a per-use basis. If a person chose to print a document in a particular font, the foundry would be paid a one-time fee for its one-time use. Unfortunately, AFIK, no one is set up to track and bill in such a manner. If some enterprising soul did develop such a system, it would be a win-win-win situation&hellip;IMHO.</p>

<p>As Matthew Butterick suggested above, you’ll be better served by initiating a dialog directly with a representative of the foundry (or foundries) whose types you are interested in licensing and discussing your needs personally and in specifics. That way you can get a clearly tailored response. This kind of thing is just not going to be covered by a generic EULA.</p>
