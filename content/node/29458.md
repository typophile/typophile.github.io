  the first time I've been working on making small-caps and I need your experienced

  the capitals (the gray one) seemed just odd so I redrew it, that too needs your

    too heavy and too small. They have to be larger than the x-height of the lowercase
    characters because otherwise they look smaller.\r\n\r\nPieter"

    If I compare the old glyphs and the new ones I find them much heavier, not sure
    the balance is quite right yet but I'm satisfied for today. I need some time away
    from it to see it with fresh eyes and find the bad stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>There\u2019s

    <li>added a \"Th\" ligature.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAlso in the less obvious (but
    you probably notice it anyway):\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>tweaked the letters heights on
    the rounded small-caps letters that seemed to be too low or floating in the air,</li>\r\n
    <li>tweaked some shapes so they fit better with the overall color of the typeface.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI

  body: "Looks like it's coming along nicely. I would say that it could be a little
    lighter still, especially letters with diagonal dark strokes like AMNVWXY.\r\n\r\nThe
    E has a couple of problems. Crossbar is too low, and middle serif is too big and
    bold, I think. Similar problems for F and H. U seems to have a bulgy weight at
    7:00. OSF's 5 seems to have too wide a bottom.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I have a
    good general reference for making small caps, but Nick Shinn's <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Richler/Richler_Specimen.pdf\">Richler</a>
    sample is one good example from a highly technically competent designer.\r\n\r\n"

    more than that personally, but I'm not the only one in this; I'll propose some
    changes later but right now my focus is making small-caps and old-style figures
    fit with the rest of the font."
