    target="_blank"> Windsor Condensed</a> - just like Stanley Kubrick is obsessed  <BR>with
    Futura Black, Woody Allen uses &#40;almost?&#41; exclusively  <BR>Windsor for
    the titling of all his movies.

  body: I agree with your ID for this, but I can surely think of other fonts that
    Woody has used for his movie titles, even though I am not in a position to prove
    my claim.  <BR> <BR>It could be a good Typophile Trivia &#40;if there was such
    a forum&#41; thread. <BR> <BR>I may research this a bit, just to make my point.
    Which others do you know that use Windsor Condensed?

  body: I meant the on-screen titling - the credits and stuff before  <BR>and after
    the movie - not the posters/movie logos. I was  <BR>assuming this is a screen
    grab.

  body: I just spent some time at this site for <a href="http://www.woodyallenmovies.com/woodyallenmovies.htm"
    target="_blank">Woody Allen Movies</a> and based on the images they show for his
    films, I saw only three that used Windsor Condensed &#40;Sweet &amp; Lowdown,
    Celebrity and Everyone says I Love you&#41; -- three movies made between 1996
    and 1999.  <BR> <BR>Maybe that was Woody&#39;s &#34;Windsor Period&#34;? <BR>
    <BR>The type for the other films ran a very wide range of styles from ITC Anna
    to Bodoni  to Bookman and even some that were hand lettered. I think he even used
    Trajan once -- shudder!

  body: 'I&#39;m with Yves on this one - the Woodman&#39;s opening titles are a real
    signature: black background, Windsor font, stars listed alphabetically, tinkly
    jazz. They&#39;ve looked this way for decades and have no relationship, design-wise
    to his posters.  <BR> <BR>I was actually asked to rip them off for a student film
    some years ago. <BR> <BR>Dig the new pic, Yves.'
