  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just joined at the suggestion of a friend who is a regular contributor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of designing a few logo&rsquo;s as a company is building me a website as a portal with a few distinct business' steaming from it, I&rsquo;d like to have each one having its own identity.</p>
<p>I am self taught and therefore not the polished article. I would just like to court the expertise of a number of professional eyes.</p>
<p>Here are two of the companies and various logo&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been playing with, I would really appreciate it if you&rsquo;d maybe pass a critical eye over them and make some suggestions with respect to the design or colour schemes.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some input, critique, warnings or suggestions to carry me forward. Feel free to post whatever, I have a thick skin.</p>
<p>The first is ScotBath DIRECT, taps, showers, bathroom suites, towel radiators, etc.</p>
<p>The idea is its a stylised Saltire (Scottish National Flag), I tried to introduce the waves (evoking water) with the flag (as if it was blowing in the wind with folds) but still reasonably geometrical and regimented.</p>

<p>The other one in question is Q Gardens. I have tended towards a script font in this one as they naturally seem to lend themselves to this business, however I am open to alternatives as discussed.</p>

<p>Anyone who posts here will hear negative comments sometimes, along with comments that they might feel are unhelpful. Especially if your designs are &ldquo;not polished&rdquo; as you said yourself.</p>
<p>My advise would be to keep the tone friendly even if you don&rsquo;t like some of the responses.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An easy way to separate the amateurs from the professionals* is to gauge their reaction to criticism. You admit you are amateur, so I don&rsquo;t think we can fault you for that reaction to James' comment. But note that it wasn&rsquo;t particular mean. Just blunt. As professionals, most of us** much prefer honest and blunt critique over sugar coated half-assed praises disguised as critique.</p>
<p>So, point being, welcome to your first lesson on receiving critiques: Don&rsquo;t take them personally&hellip;it&rsquo;s a comment on the work, not you as a person.</p>
<p>Also, IMHO, I find the best design solution isn&rsquo;t always apparent in a vacuum. Often just one little idea from a critique can take the project into a whole other (and better) direction.</p>
<p>That out of the way, I have to second JamesM&hellip;no need to post 36 copies of one logo. Post one, and let us focus on that.</p>
<p>To offer some hopefully useful feedback, the first thing that jumps out at me on all your logos is the double-outline. It&rsquo;s very jarring and adds nothing but complexity to the forms. I suggest as a start that you strip out all of the outlines.</p>
<p>Secondly, explore a bit more. Do some sketching. Play with some type. A big part of logo design is brainstorming ideas and exploring them to see where they take you. Figure for every hour of drawing the logo there are 5-10 hours of sketches and brainstorms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Granted, in this industry, even some of our celebrity designers can be thin skinned Prima Donnas.</li>
</ul>
<p>** OK, maybe I&rsquo;m wishful thinking there. I <em>hope</em> most of us, as professionals, prefer the honest, even if blunt, critiques over the &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s pretty good&hellip;&rdquo; fluff.</p>

<p><a href="http://typophile.com/forum/23">http://typophile.com/forum/23</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been some amazing back-and-forth critique/rework processes in there over the years that are a lot of fun to read and watch as a logo morphs from the initial idea into something quite often different but wonderful. You&rsquo;ll also get a feel for how a designer uses the critiques and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily implement suggestions verbatim but uses them as a point of departure for that next round of ideation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Welcome to Typophile.</p>
<p>If you want your work critiqued, put it in the appropriate place:
Home » Forums » Critique » Logos / Corporate ID Design
(Seeking an &lsquo;appraisal&rsquo; is odd. Fishing for compliments won&rsquo;t make a design better.)</p>
<p>Upload images that aren&rsquo;t too wide for Typophile. I think 580 pixels is the max&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t post low quality JPEGs that are CMYK. In my browser (Safari 5 on OS X) the images appear with wildly incorrect color (the whites are black, the greens are purple) because you didn&rsquo;t save them properly. I had to open the images in Photoshop to see the correct color, and then I saw blurry, aliased images.</p>
<p>None of the ScotBath variations suggest the Scottish Saltire to me. I am American, don&rsquo;t know the history of heraldry, but a quick Google search shows me that a green saltire isn&rsquo;t really Scottish. So why have the logo be in green if you want it to evoke the flag of Scotland? Blue on teal is unreadable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the diagonal/cross of the flag in your waves. At best it makes the overall shape look woven, but it doesn&rsquo;t do what you want it to. It doesn&rsquo;t communicate water or flag to me.</p>
<p>The type choices are lame. Both are boring. Like aluminum says, keep exploring.</p>
<p>This all needs more refinement. You want help to &ldquo;carry [you] forward&rdquo; and part of that is getting honest critiques. I think Typophile can be an immensely rewarding community if you take the time to read and research all the information posted throughout the site. Take a look at the Typowiki and Resources link at the top. Lurk before you post.</p>
<p>All of that said, I look forward to seeing your next iteration.</p>
<p>(No comments on Q Gardens, because it is easier to critique it separately. Don&rsquo;t force two topics into the same thread)</p>

<p>I meant to mention that also; I had to switch browsers to view them properly. You might try using Photoshop&rsquo;s &ldquo;save for web&rdquo; feature (File &gt; Save for Web and Devices) when preparing a graphic to post. It saves a copy of your graphic as a 72 dpi RGB JPEG that has a much smaller file size than the original; perfect for posting on the web. Once you learn how to use it, it&rsquo;s a quick and easy way to make JPEGs to post.</p>

<p>As a newcomer you might not know he&rsquo;s referring to Dunwich Type, who like me is named James. :)</p>
