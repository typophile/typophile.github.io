body: I like this type. Is it just me or is the spacing really loose? It has an early
  silent films feel to it, like the type they'd use for the dialog placards between
  shots.

    just how it was set for the titles.\r\n\r\nI keep wanting to call it Ohmigod."

  body: "I like some of the Mac Rhino faces, but this one appears to me quite awkward.
    To some others this might be nicely innovative, but for me, the rounds are too
    light compared to the verticals, resulting in a disturbingly uneven color. Also
    for me the serifs appear to be snapped on backwards. A traditional pen-influenced
    way (from Jenson on) is to have the left a thicker wedge and the right a thinner,
    longer horizontal. To me this makes visual sense, giving a sense of motion in
    the direction of reading. The other way around kind of feels to me like bumps
    in the road. \r\n\r\nI guess I should be an equal opportunity critic and say that
    I detested Super Duty. No problems with the crafting of the shapes, but I just
    took an antipathy to the brutal look and some difficult-to-read characters...\r\n\r\n "

  body: 'I have been looking at the PDF of Ommegaand, and I''m wondering if part of
    the unevenness I saw is due to a problem with hinting, or with embedding it in
    Flash, and not with the font. I still feel something is off, but when I look at
    it large in the PDF it looks a lot more balanced... '

  body: It's definitely spaced for text, not headlines. Typophile should adjust the
    tracking for use at this large size.

  body: At the moment, sIFR does not support kerning, so the way it performs here
    is going to be slightly different than when users have tighter control over it,
    not to mention the rendering in Flash will undoubtedly affect its appearance on
    screen.

  body: "<cite> sIFR does not support kerning </cite>\r\n\r\nThis explains a great
    deal. I kept wondering why Beorcana looked so different on Typophile - and that
    was the reason I most suspected. And Zara is of course 100% correct about rendering
    being a significant factor.\r\n\r\nBill, I agree with you that these is something
    about it that is surprising. I think part of it is the unusual details at the
    end of the top 'arm'* of the 'a'. The cuts at the joins are not as extreme as
    I would like when it's used at smallers sizes.\r\n\r\nBut the thing I like about
    it is the flavor of it. It's got a clunky but likeable voice. \r\n\r\nWhen you
    look closely at the serifs I think you find about half the reason for that voice.
    \ They are really weird. Weirder than I would expect you could get away with.
    \r\n\r\nBut there is something to that uneveness thing you brought up too. When
    you look at the o & u next to each other they don't match in the way you would
    expect. The feeling get from this - too naively I admit -  is of uneven letter
    press. Perhaps that was the intent. To create something that slips an association
    of the coloful & antique past you - but in a new way. Of course maybe I am reading
    too much into it.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to set a menu or an information piece
    about a Hotel or a Magazine article in this font than a book. This isn't a ding
    or a negative - just my sense of what it's most suited to. I can say that about
    plenty of faces I respect - like Sanuk & Amalia for instance.\r\n\r\n* Actually
    I have forgotten if I ever knew - what is that part called anyway?"

  body: 'Eben, looking again, I think what is most causing what is for me an unbalanced
    look is the disparity in the treatment of top horizontal arches. The treatment
    of the arches on the hmn is much heavier than in the acdso, for example. It is
    not just that the biggest and smallest places are different, but also that so
    much weight is carried from the right stems on the mnh so far into the join with
    the left stems. Stefan has other fonts that are well balanced, so these things
    were deliberate decisions. But for me they break the boundaries of what the eye
    is comfortable reading.    '

    I also agree with Andrew about it seeming a bit loose.  That said, I have to admit
    it is sort of growing on me a bit."
