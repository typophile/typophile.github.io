    family includes a Condensed version that is quite similar and its Italic face
    has an A very much like this. It would be easy to tweak to match better, since

  body: Definitely Bodoni. From the shape of the <strong>S</strong> I'd guess this
    started out as a regular Roman, and the designer manually condensed it. The bowls
    on the <strong>R</strong>s look like they've been condensed even more than everything
    else, and the <strong>A</strong> looks like it was stitched together with an <strong>I</strong>.
