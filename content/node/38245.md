  a set of font in AI.\r\nI wanna import these paths to softwares so that I could
  create a real font file.\r\nI have downloaded typetool but couldn't find such function.\r\nIs
  there any software I can achieve this? \r\n\r\nA million thanks\r\n\r\nEdward"

    used to do Illustrator drawings before importing to TypeTool, but it is much,
