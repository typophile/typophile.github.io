  body: Hard to say for me with such a reworked sample. What's its origin? Or do you
    still have the original version?

  body: "This was the one I've extracted to use it with an online recognizion tool
    :) Here's a colour image from the original (It was a compressed jpeg). It's from
    a brochure. I've chose this because it has the widest range of significant letter.
    It's similar to Heron Sans but the g is different too. Thanks for your interest
    :)\r\nReally appreciated :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SampleFont_4583.png] "

    the Normal weight.
