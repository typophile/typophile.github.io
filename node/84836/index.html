  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's my latest font in the making.  It is inspired by a font ID request here on Typophile which went unsolved.  Inspired in that I've taken the basic feel of that font and some of its characteristics (mostly the crescent shaped half ball terminals - I'm sure there must be a proper name for these) and 'transplanted' them onto a Plantin-based text font I was already working on.  Please note the only thing I've taken from Plantin are the basic proportions and metrics (and for the time being, kerning, which I will no doubt scrap and start from scratch as the need arises).  The outlines are all my own.  What do you think?  Specifically, what are people's thoughts on 'borrowing' metrics from other fonts.  Surely this doesn't constitute any copyright infringement.  I definitely remember reading an interview with a type designer recently (I forget her name) where she said she usually starts a new design from an existing one.

Anyway, any criticism is greatly appreciated.  The aim is to make a readable text font (for print more than for screen) with a bit of character.  I'm undecided on the Nike-esque swooshes, and I think the serifs being thicker than some of the thins maybe looks a little odd, but sometimes odd is good?!

		<div class="commentbody">Just to be clear on this, I haven't opened Plantin and changed a few points.  I've made a new font from scratch for which proportions were influenced by Plantin and kerning has been imported from Plantin (for the time being - I will definitely change it because it doesn't fit my design as well as 'homemade' kerning would).  So I'm not trying to 'get away with' creating a new font quickly by modifying an existing one.  I will freely admit that spacing is not my strong point and to this end, I have looked at how other fonts space glyphs as a starting point.  There's obviously a lot more tweaking to be done on this one.  In the end, I dare say it will bear little resemblance to Plantin.  What do you think?  Is it looking derivative?  That is 100% not my intention.  I give credit to designers who make revivals but that's not my thing.  I think back to art lessons in school, where we would paint copies of old masters' works.  The teachers weren't trying to create a bunch of forgers, but to make us identify their techniques and learn from them.  That is what I'm trying to do here, but if appropriating similar spacing from pre-existing fonts is frowned upon, I'll simply keep the outlines and space them myself, for better or for worse.  I hate spacing so much I might even consider iKern.  Has anybody used this service?  What did you think?</div>

I've removed all kerning and changed the spacing to my own, so now all that's left of Plantin is the proportions, and even they have changed somewhat. No curves, points, side-bearings etc. are now in any way 'borrowed'. I'm doing it the long way, and hopefully learning more that way!
As I said, there's no kerning for now so it should give a clearer picture of where I'm going wrong with my spacing.
Also added numerals since last posts and thinned out the bushy tails of K and R.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is becoming rather delicious! The numerals are especially nice, and I love the 4. It may need a larger counter (you could thin the stem a little perhaps).

A few other observations:

/b/ is floating above the baseline. ('blind' in first para.) Or maybe it just needs more colour bottom left?

Tail of /j/ is crashing into the baseline serifs ('enjoy' in the third para).

/i/ and /r/ look dark. 

/s/ is a little too curly for my taste — I'd open out the terminals a bit more and let the counters breathe.

1 might benefit from a wider head.

6 looks a little squashed.

/R/ is causing spacing problems with its outstretched leg, in the third para. I like the shape so perhaps it could just be rotated clockwise to bring its foot in slightly?

The name suits the design, nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Added new pdf to original post.  Updates to most of the above as per Bendy's suggestions.  
Maybe I've not gone far enough with the s, but I kind of like curls.  
Cut inner serif from Eszett to let it breathe a bit more.  
Added more weight to the tittles of i and j.  I think their previous size was a contributing factor to the apparent darkness of the stems.  Might be wrong.  
Taken a bit of weight from the arm of r where it meets stem.  
Tucked in leg of R.  
Lowered bottom left corner of b.  
lowered and reduced in size terminal of j.  
Slightly widened 6, but I think its apparent squashedness may have been more due to width of 5 - I'll have another look at this.  
1 is widened top and bottom and the top serif changed shape a bit.</div>

I kind of liked the curly serifs on E and F but I think the new ones are better because they give the crossbar more room.  I've decided on the above compromise - basically took out one anchor point and the serifs are now half way between before and after.  Much happier with the T - it's starting to look more like a T and less like a palm tree!
<cite>BTW remember to take my suggestions with plenty of salt and sugar, it's your design and I'm no pro. :)</cite>
Clearly you are a pro!  But seriously - I'm not going to go through it changing everything people suggest.  Mostly it's a case in the critique section of people pointing things out which I'd notice myself if I was critiquing someone else's font, but when you stare at the same thing for too long you get blind to it.
The connected italics idea was just a thought really because my first stabs at drawing the italic look pretty rubbish.  Trying to find a way of getting the 'foxiness' of the upright into it, but I've had a go at connected italics and this is definitely not the way to go with it.</div>

I'm still looking closely at Plantin, but I've strayed further from it for the italic than I did for the Roman.  I wanted the weight of the italic to be pretty similar to Roman.  Plantin's italic looks a bit weedy to my eyes.  Uppercase is mainly slanted Roman with some exceptions (K, R, Q) and slight adjustments.

Overall I'm pretty happy with it, but as always, and critique is greatly appreciated.

From the Millennial Oldstyle post where this cropped up, I don't think there are many occasions where ae and oe appear much in the same language, so ambiguities leading to confusing the two are rare. I'm leaning to #2. #1 just looks a little strange to me - almost like a swash small cap R</div>

Now that you’ve pointed it out, I cannot un-see it ;-)
#2 is beautiful, but it looks to me almost just a cursive a.
I still think you should try to “sacrifice” a bit the shape of e.</div>

I see it in all three styles. The /C/ in Bold looks right but most other capital letters look slightly too dark.

Did you settle on the design of the ae character yet? I really like the texture of the text in #4. I'm not sure if ae in italic should really match the one-story design of /a/ but if you insist on that then I think the latest design you posted works really well.</div>
