  body: "There are a couple of strange letters here, like the S and C. I think stroke
    has been added to make the lettering bolder. The most similar font I could come
    up with was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/nimrod-small-ads-mt/regular-small-caps/|Nimrod
    Small Ads Small Caps]] using all lower case. While I think this is close, I'm
    not convinced about the S being the same. Maybe it would be close enough?  (I
    may try to simulate this if I have this Nimrod font -- stay tuned)\r\n\r\n- Mike
