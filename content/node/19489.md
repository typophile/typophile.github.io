  included some contextual alternates as part of my design. It seems like what I'm
  doing is by the book, but maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong or point me
  to a thread I haven't seen before that addresses this topic. \r\n\r\nThe code I've
  been trying to use is this:\r\n\r\nfeature liga { # Standard Ligatures\r\n # Latin\r\n
  \   sub c h by C_H;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nI created a new glyph named C_H, but when
  I go the preview button in the OpenType panel, nothing happens when i type in ch.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  one more question: how do I add more glyphs if there aren't enough for my purposes?
  I know in OpenType, you can add more than you would ever need for most purposes,
  but how do i go about doing this? thanks for your help."

    thing: have you compiled the OT code before you try to view your features?"
