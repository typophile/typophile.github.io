  body: "This is very close to H&FJ's Knockout series*, maybe the 66 weight. The \"W\"
    and mostly the \"Y\" have filled up a little \u2013 maybe a stroke added? (In
    which case it might also be the 46 weight, or even the 26 \u2013 I can't test
    this, don't have the fonts.)\r\n* http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013"
