  body: For any questins about type on movie posters you can always check my <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/">Unzipped</a>
    blog. It's searchable, so just type in the movie title and it will return whatever
    you're looking for. The blog is in Dutch, but that makes no difference for typeface
    names. ;^)
