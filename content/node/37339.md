body: "\r\nI was wondering if anybody has any information about the design or what
  has influenced the design of this phototype beauty.  I was looking through this
  late 70s art book this morning that is set quite well in this typeface. I am thinking
  that I may want to break away from some of my usual suspects in type selection for
  my next project.\r\n\r\nI will try to provide a scan from this book once the scanning
  machine over here becomes available.\r\n\r\nAny history, factoids, opinions, criticisms,
  or even good type-pairings are well appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n-David"

  body: "So far I've only found two citings in print:\r\n\r\n<em>Rookledge's International
    Directory of Type Designers</em>, 1994:\r\nJos\xE9 Mendoza y Almedia\r\nFrench,
    20th century\r\n<em>Photina (1971)</em>\r\n...His best-known typeface is Photina,
    released by the Monotype Corporation in 1971. It was only their third typeface
    designed exclusively for filmsetting and was designed to work harmoniously with
    Adrian Frutiger's Univers series.\r\n\r\n<em>Fine Print Magazine</em>, 1979.\r\nGALLIARD,
    by Charles Bigelow\r\n\r\n...In such a climate special note should therefore be
    taken of the designers and introducers of new text faces which use the photocomposition
    medium to best advantage. (edited out several designers)... Jos\xE9 Mendoza's
    Photina (Monophoto, 1972) combines a calligraphic, Old-style letterform with the
    serifs and a contrast of a Modern. As a serifed face, it was designed to align
    and mate with the sans serif Univers."

  body: "Thanks for the infos.  Good to know that my natural inclination to pair it
    with Univers is reinforced, even though I have a natural inclination to pair just
    about everything with Univers :)\r\n\r\nI'd like to know what all Charles Bigelow
    knows about this one.  I wonder what Mendoza was referencing exactly."
