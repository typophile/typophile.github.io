  what I need to make. I Have a paragraph - looks like first (first attachment) and
  I want to make automatically with this text something like this:\r\n\r\nM_e__e____t_____F______a__________c___________t____________o_________________________r______________________________
  ...etc,\r\n\r\n=> every space between letters getting bigger with higher value /
  or spacing. And I need to apply it on the whole text what I have here in the document.
  Do you have any idea how to make it?\r\n\r\nHopefully you will understand it, hehe.\r\n\r\nPS:
  attached file \"settings\" actually working like I want to BUT it's not adding the
  value but repeating...\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your answer!!!"
