  sure the 3D/shadow effects are not part of the font.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/vintage_5430.jpg]

  body: Awesome!  I didn't think the inline stroke was an after-effect of the artist,
    but maybe it is.  You're right, the type looks to be an exact match otherwise.  Thanks
    for the help.
