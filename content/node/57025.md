  can't provide me with a print-quality version. The only thing that's holding me
  back from re-drawing it is the typeface used. I've tried the usual suspects (whatthefont,
  identifont) to no success (identifont suggested Helvetica; thanks identifont).\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping someone here will recognize it, and I thank you in advance. File is attached."

  body: "Arquitectura is the answer, as Renko said, but for historical interest, it
    is based on an old Spanish typeface by Carlos Winkow called Electra (shown in
    Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\"). This typeface is also the basis of \"Casablanca\"
    from Red Rooster, and \"Carlos\" from Castle. \r\n\r\nAn interesting note is that
    the sample in Jaspert for Electra Estrecha Fina uses the word \"ARQUITECTURA\"
    as part of a sample phrase.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
