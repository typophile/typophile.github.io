  body: "As tor the roughening treatment on _HANDYMAN_, note that appears only on
    the middle letters and matches the treatment on the hammerhead symbol. Which means

    Patrick Griffin's Clarendon Wide Bold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClarendonWideBoldAsHANDY_4792.gif]
    \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-wide/ as a reasonable match.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Not matching perfectly (a [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/clarendon-no1/expanded-bold|URW
    Clarendon Expanded Bold]] looks cigar to me) but you may like the brand new relaesed
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fort-foundry/colt|Colt]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fort-foundry/colt-soft|Colt
    Soft]] by the talented (George) Mattox Shuler looks promising.
