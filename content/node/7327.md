body: I have a feeling this is either very easy or very hard/impossible. <BR> <BR>I
  am in the middle of building a unicase typeface that is designed to use alternative
  adjacent characters. Currently, Set 1 is mapped to the uppercase and Set 2 is lowercase,
  but they will need to be re-ordered for the system to work correctly. <BR> <BR>What
  I would like to be able to achieve in FontLab is to be able to alternate these on
  the fly, rather than the user having to swap on the fly by hand.  <BR> <BR>So, if
  I type &#34;Thomas Phinney may know&#34;, then the substitutions would be &#34;ThOmAs
  PhInNeY mAy KnOw&#34; - the very first character is the &#39;seed&#39;, so to speak,
  and all characters after that alternate. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a tad out of my depth.
  After reading the manual and consulting with a very nice Frenchman, it seems likely
  that I need to set up a context-dependent substitution - the FLab manual gives the
  example of replacing a smallcap with a lowercase letter if preceeded by a capital,
  but that technique isn&#39;t &#39;chaining&#39; &#40;for want of a better word&#41;
  a whole series of substitutions. <BR> <BR>Can anyone help? Is this even possible?

  body: 'This is actually not very hard at all to program, although &#40;in my quick
    formulation at least&#41; it requires you use placeholder glyphs for intermediate
    processing, and multiple lookups. Actually, FontLab will automatically break this
    into multiple lookups if you don&#39;t, so you can ignore that part in my sample
    code; I just put it in there for those who need/want to understand an extra level
    &#34;under the hood.&#34; <BR> <BR>So here&#39;s my solution, expressed in FontLab/FDK
    syntax. I tested a first version of this, so I&#39;m pretty sure it works. The
    only thing that needs to be done is define and add a set of placeholder glyphs
    and enumerate them, where I have referred to [@placeholders]. <BR> <BR>feature
    calt { # Connection Forms <BR> # Latin <BR> <BR>lookup calt1 { <BR><blockquote>sub
    [A-Z] [A-Z]&#39; by [@placeholders] ; <BR>sub [a-z] [a-z]&#39; by [A-Z] ;</blockquote>}
    calt1; <BR> <BR>lookup calt2 {<blockquote>sub [@placeholders] by [a-z];</blockquote>}
    calt2; <BR> <BR>} calt;'

  body: You are truly a king amongst men, Thomas. My laptop&#39;s battery is dead
    so I&#39;m going to run to Piccadilly Circus tube to get home as soon as possible
    and try this out. <BR> <BR>Many many many thanks! <BR> <BR>David
