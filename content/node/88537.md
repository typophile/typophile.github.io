body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a digital version of OPTI Majer Irregular, preferably
  one without the checkered past of OPTI fonts. It's the secondary font used for Curious
  George seen [[http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/cgsite/|here]] as the
  secondary headings.\r\n\r\nI know OPTI fonts are poor quality digitizations of fonts
  swiped from elsewhere, so if anyone has any clue as to the original typeface, that
  would be fantastic!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"

  body: Thanks so much! This is by far the closest match I've seen, and I've been
    at this for a while. If anyone has any other history about the pre-digital source,
    I'd be grateful.

    is Filmotype\u2019s Modern, as stated in the description provided on MyFonts.
    \r\nI said that it was one rendition because it could be that there were variations
    that wasn\u2019t digitised. "
