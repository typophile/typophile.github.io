body: "I know this topic is far from new here, but I'm trying to figure out what consensus
  there is on this issue, if any, amongst type designers and professional type consumers.
  \ As someone who is just trying to get started in the trade, I'm anxious to get
  a feel for the acceptable boundaries.\r\n\r\nWhere does one draw the line between
  a legitimate revival, and a deplorable knockoff?  I know the legal rules, more or
  less - in North America at least, typeface design is not protected by copyright
  (but can be protected by design patent to a limited extent), whereas specific digital
  implementations are protected.  But I've seen a lot of talk here on Typophile effectively
  equating cloning with piracy.  If I can't judge the distinction based on legal terms,
  what are the generally accepted moral terms?  Or is there no consensus at all?\r\n\r\nIs
  the critical factor whether or not the original designer is still alive?  Or is
  it my own motivation in creating the revival - an attempt to provide something which
  I feel is legitimately lacking, versus an opportunistic attempt to undercut an existing
  product on the cheap?  The second point seems awfully subjective, since there's
  no sure-fire way somebody else's motivations.\r\n\r\nI realize that these and other
  factors must probably be weighed together, but it does make things a bit difficult
  for me in deciding what I should consider off-limits.\r\n\r\nTo provide a concrete
  example... earlier this year, I read in a text on type design that it can be a good
  learning exercise for a starting designer to try taking samples of a metal type
  and creating a digital font out of it.  I was looking at some old twentieth-century
  samples of metal-type Centaur being used as a book face, and it occurred to me that
  I've never seen a digital version that comes close to it (they're all too thin and
  spidery, and oddly sterile to boot).  So I picked up a copy of <em>The Centaur Types</em>
  and began trying to create a new implementation of Centaur that had something of
  the same flavour as found in the pages of that book - more substantial letters,
  more relaxed spacing, and less of a harsh \"crispness\" in print.  \r\n\r\nWell,
  it's come far enough that I can use it for my own printing tasks, and I'm actually
  pleasantly surprised at the results.  The question is... what can I do with it,
  ethically speaking?  (Oddly enough, I ran across Raph Levien's old thread on the
  same topic a few weeks ago...)  Bruce Rogers, the designer, has been dead for more
  than 50 years, so even if design was copyrightable, it would have expired by now
  (at least in Canada where I live).   It is also patently not an attempt to simply
  clone any of the existing digital Centaurs that I'm aware of.  Would it be more
  ethically acceptable to (a) keep it as a purely personal trinket and not make it
  public at all; (b) Make it available free under the OFL or some other free license;
  or (c) Try and develop it to commercial quality and sell it?\r\n\r\nAs a different
  example, I've also been looking at a rather nice old Frederic Goudy design called
  \"Goudy Lanston\".  This one doesn't seem to have any digital versions at all (that
  I've been able to find, at least)... but I do notice that P22 seems to hold a trademark
  on the name, which <em>may</em> imply that they're planning to make one eventually.
  \ Should I leave well alone, or play around with making my own digital version?"

  body: "The two designs you speak of are well out of any legal consideration, other
    than trademark. There's nothing to stop you making and releasing new digital versions
    of either Centaur or Goudy Lanston, and I don't see any ethical issue either.
    Even if there were strong copyright protection for typeface design, these would
    now be in the public domain.\r\n\r\nYou'll get snide comments about your lack
    of creativity or being an antiquarian hobbyist, but font manufacture, which is
    what you are talking about, is a craft, and there is no obligation to creative
    originality, only to doing a good job. An historic revival might not sell well,
    as Nick notes, but as you note there is still no good digital version of Centaur
    for text. If you find it pleasing and useful, that strikes me as reason enough
    to make one, so long as you are not kidding yourself that you will get rich from
    it."

    be the consensus\u2014and addresses Alex\u2019s concern over professional reputation
    rather than legalities. Revivals of classic serif faces have been undertaken by
    type designers in the digital era (indeed, it was a feature of the early days),
    but the vein has now been mined out and the interest is in new designs.\r\n\r\nHiding
    away or giving away one\u2019s work would seem to suggest something not quite
    right about it.\r\n\r\nAlex, as an antiquarian (which many type designers, myself
    included, are\u2014it comes with the territory), and interested in doing a revival,
    why not do a sans? Vogue, for instance, a 1930s American Futura clone.\r\nhttp://pinterest.com/pin/49539664621222523/\r\n\r\nIf
    you intend to publish your Centaur revival, be aware that it is a revival of a
    revival, and while there may not presently be a good text Centaur, there are many
    good Jensons. Also, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Monotype were to publish a
    book version of Centaur, as they did with Bembo."

  body: "@Nick & John, very good points.  In my current phase, I'm mostly interested
    in book and document faces.  For me that mostly means old style or transitional
    serifs.  It's not that I'm uninterested in display types, but there's something
    about book text that I find compelling.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all the fonts I designed
    prior to my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/93634\">Suzuran</a> concept work
    were sans-serifs.  I won't delude myself into thinking they're particularly good,
    and they certainly aren't particularly original; they were designed for specific
    purposes within fairly narrow parameters.  But I am interested in expanding into
    serif types, hence these experiments.\r\n\r\nI also figured it might be a useful
    way of getting my feet wet, so to speak.  How can I move into creating original
    and innovative types if I don't have an intimate understanding of how existing
    types work and fit together?\r\n\r\nOne reason Centaur (the book version) in particular
    fascinated me is how it consciously uses irregularities and imperfections as part
    of its charm.  Adobe Jenson and Cloister also do this up to a point, but Centaur
    really takes the concept and runs with it.  It has an almost intimate feel to
    it, in spite of its elegance."

    working on a new cut (I wouldn\u2019t call this a revival, as digital versions
    of Centaur already exist) of an existing face would be an excellent way to begin
    learning type design as you plumb the ins and outs of the face. \r\n\r\nOn top
    of all that, I, too, would be interested in seeing a new version of Centaur. \r\n"

    my efforts, I always give credit where credit is due. And even revivals present
    opportunities for your own creative input. When I made a digital version of Stephenson
    Blake's Glenmoy, I took exception with some of the original letterforms, and revised
    the /p/ and /x/ characters so that they were more to my liking (and, presumably,
    more attractive to type buyers). So, if you can improve or expand a venerable
    workhorse, go for it. Just make sure that whatever you name your efforts doesn't
    violate one of Berthold's trademarks..."
