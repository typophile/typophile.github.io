  of the human hand - exploring things like buttons, motion studies, histories of
  handwriting, proto-ergonomics. An issue of major interest to me has to do with the
  standardization and interchangeability of early typefaces - how good were the knockoffs?
  If you bought up the type from a defunct house that was cut from the same plan as
  a font family you already owned, what were the chances that you could swap out letters?
  I'm interested in the economics, in the cultures and habitus of early designers
  and cutters, the personal and the universal (universal in the sense that interchangeable
  parts for the Model T or the Wood reaper were universal) in letterforms.\r\n\r\nSo
  of course I'm doing a ton of archival research, but I thought I'd ask here: Which
  books in this range would you particularly recommend? Extra thanks for any books
  that reproduce primary sources in early printing culture - wills, letters, auction
  records, inventories . . . And, since I'm just digging into this, it's possible
  somebody's done it well already - please deliver the smackdown and I'll move on.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks for your time. If you want to reach me off the thread, email f at mavo dot
  nu, or IM rundfunkantiqua."

  body: "Finn, I'm not exactly on expert on this topic but I can give you a few starting
    points. First is that there was no standardization of type measurements until
    the late 1700s. See Wikipedia's entry for Typographic Unit for a not-bad general
    overview.\r\n\r\nSince before that time there was no pressure for different typefaces
    to correlate dimensionally, each cutter was free to create various sizes of his
    typefaces as he wished (the various sizes were then named, not numbered). However,
    there is evidence that there were some early in-house dimensional norms. Here
    is a quote from Peter Burnhill in his book, Type spaces:\r\n\r\n\"...histories
    of printing technology had left the impression that printers \u2013 working before
    the divorce of typefounding from the printing trade, to become a separate industry
    \u2013 had contrived to put types and spaces together without reference to a system
    of measurement.\r\n    Later, it became clear [to the author] that Aldus [Manutius]
    must have commanded a very refined system of dimensional control long before manufacturers
    of types and spaces for sale to the printing trade sought to regularize type body
    sizes...\"\r\n\r\nThis book \u2013 Type spaces: in-house norms in the typography
    of Aldus Manutius \u2013 contains an exhaustive examiniation through original
    sources of the dimensions of Aldus's types and usage. Seems it would be one excellent
    starting point. It contains a bibliography of 35 books.\r\n\r\nI'll let you draw
    your own conclusions on the interchangability of early type, but my guess is that
    it would have been quite rare. Given the easy interchangability of digital typefaces
    today it's still quite rare (and usually bad practice) to swap glyphs except in
    the case of some symbols or punctuation."

    body: Just wanted to thank the Typophile gang for your help - here and in a number
      of emails. You know you're dealing with a sharp community when the problems
      people have answering your questions describe not their ignorance but the way
      your question is poorly phrased and formed. I've got a lot more reading and
      thinking to do now. Molto grazie.
