  business cards.\r\n\r\nhow many do you think I should make?  to send out, hand out,
  etc.\r\n\r\nsomeone suggested 1000, I was thinking like 300."

  body: "The set-up costs are the big up-front expense in printing. There is usually
    some break point where the savings is negligible if any at all for quantities
    below a certain amount. For offset printed business cards this is often 1000 units,
    though it can vary from shop to shop. Less than that and you won't save much,
    but above that you're just paying for more ink and paper and cutting, and the
    unit cost drops significantly.\r\n\r\nYou might never actually use 1000 business
    cards before you need to change them, especially coming straight out of school,
    but it's better to have too many than not enough."

  body: Consider that if you print 500 or 1000 the price will be the same, then, just
    make as many as 14.99 can pay. On a 14 pt coated stock with UV aqueous coating,
    two-sided 4/4. If you are a graduating student or a Five Stars General it doesn't
    matter. Go on and print the cards as you wish.

  body: "I'd keep the info as general as possible if you're printing a large quantity
    - just name, email, web site, mobile. You'll move before you're through 100 most
    likely. I just had 500 printed, don't plan on moving, and wonder if I'll ever
    get through them.\r\n\r\nHad good luck with vistaprint - it's cheap, fast, the
    quality is good and if I DO move or change info it's cheap enough to reprint.
    I got 500 for about $45 including delivery and I went for deluxe stock, printing
    both sides, etc."

  body: "If you're printing offset (not digital) the printer is making 1000 anyway,\r\nmaybe
    2000, and throwing out whatever you don't buy.\r\n\r\nYour card will be set with
    many other designs- just one copy of yours per page and 1000\r\ncopies printed.
    It's not worth turning on a press for less, and in fact, the press is so fast,
    it would be hard to print less- unless you crank it by hand."

  body: "I get lots of business cards from all over the spectrum: from new design
    grads to seasoned design veterans. Many have been printed on good ink jet printers
    in these people's workrooms. They print them several-up on letter-size paper,
    with trim marks. Then they cut them out by hand with a sharp knife while watching
    TV or something.\r\n\r\nYes: they look different than cards printed offset. But
    if they are designed well and printed on a good printer, and cleanly trimmed out
    they can be quite good looking.\r\n\r\nI have no objection to getting these cards.
    They can be just as effective. You save lots of money, and you can change info
    as often as you want. & you waste a lot less paper.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: Will - I did that for years - printed my cards on my inkjet. They looked great.
    But with the prices now - I am really happy with how my cards look and at that
    price, no problem to redo them if I want a change. It's so liberating.
