  fonts in Type Tool and discovered, much to my dismay, that their fonts seem sloppily
  drawn: baselines and cap heights consistently don't match one another between letters
  or even in the same letter. None of my other fonts seem to do this. Is it normal,
  or are they optical adjustments that I don't understand?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for
  your input!"

    and ask them about this, complain really, and see if it wasn't a mistake.

  body: Many foundries used each other's data in the first wave of trying to collect
    every font in the world (early 90's). So while the outlines of Berthold's Futura
    might be inconsistent, I'd bet that Berthold's own designs were digitized to an
    extremely high level of precision. Berthold allowed Adobe to produce and distribute
    PS versions of their fonts only after Adobe proved that they could match Berthold's
    data exactly. Check one of the BQ originals like Formata, Comenius or Pontifex.

  body: "> Does that help?\r\n\r\nYes. Thanks.\r\n\r\nYour screen shots reveal that
    you are using the raw font files which were produced by the defunct H. Berthold
    AG prior to its bankruptcy. The entire collection had been hastily scanned and
    converted to raw fonts in PS font format, but the finishing of the raw fonts was
    not possible due to the sudden liquidation of the company by the Berlin court.\r\n\r\nIn
    my documentation \"The mentally deranged graphic designer as font buyer\" I proved
    for another font collection that not all, but most font buyers are mentally deranged
    graphic designers. For the Berthold \"Quality\" collection it can be proved too
    that not all, but most font buyers are mentally deranged graphic designers.\r\n\r\nSeveral
    years after the liquidation of the H. Berthold AG, an American confidence trickster
    couple declared themselves to be the legal successors of the defunct H. Berthold
    AG stock corporation, and after appropriating the raw fonts, they declared themselves
    to be the copyright owners. For the past 10 years this couple has been selling
    these raw fonts in order to cheat mentally deranged graphic designers, who have
    not been mentally able to notice that the \"Quality\" fonts are the raw, unfinished
    font files.\r\n\r\nDuring these past 10 years, it seems that Mr. Yoshiki Waterhouse
    is the first to notice that there is something wrong with the Berthold \"Quality\"
    fonts. This proves that not all font buyers are mentally deranged.\r\n"
