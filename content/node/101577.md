  is set in on the attached image. It is a recent rebrand -- if the image doesn't
  show, here is a link to the type in question: http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/dr_quaker_and_mr_quaker.php\r\n\r\nI
  know there were two logos, one set in Archer... but haven't had any luck identifying
  this wordmark.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
