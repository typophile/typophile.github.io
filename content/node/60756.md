    A lot of questions are solved in there, and certainly is kind of lazy not to check
    in those sources before questioning here.\r\n\r\nBut in this case the answer is
    simple. In the Glyph window, go to the editing layers panel, click on the icon
    to see more options, \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EditingLayers_6501.png]\r\n\r\nand
    click on the b/w square icon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EditingLayers2_5036.png]"

    free. You can download it from here:\r\nhttp://www.font.to/downloads/manuals/FLS5MacManual.zip\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I know, the last edition of Cabarga is only available at the author\u2019s
