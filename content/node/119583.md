  wondering if you could help me pick a font.\r\n\r\nIt's actually for a new product
  but using an old illustration of a chair.\r\n\r\nI'm actually looking to use a main
  font and then a different font for smaller text underneath BUT any help would be
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks so much..\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thronesmall_5520.jpg]"
