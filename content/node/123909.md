  estate appraisal shop and I want my report to stand out from the crowd.  Appraisers
  rarely have contact/relationships with loan officers anymore, so your report has
  to stand on its own.  Our reports have headers, narrative, tables, and excel spreadsheets.
  \ I don't care for many of the stock Office fonts.  I'm looking for a modern, professional
  font with clean narrative and number characters.  Maybe single story g's.  I bought
  Trade Gothic, but I'm not sure if I like the way the numbers look in proportion
  to the letters.  Any recommendations for this use?  "
