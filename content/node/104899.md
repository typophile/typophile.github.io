    They both have this what I call \u201Cmodernist appeal\u201D. The should work
    well with Landmark\u2019s expressive look.\r\n\r\nA slab serif could be a wee
    to dominant.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFlorian\r\n[[http://www.thetypographist.com|thetypographist]]"

    recent version in the same ballpark is Font Bureau\u2019s Belizio (based on Novarese\u2019s
    Egizio).\r\nMore recent still, House Industries\u2019 Eames.\r\nTo exploit the
    Victorian roots of modern type, Shinntype\u2019s Scotch Modern."

    little bit to slab in my opinion."
