  a web-based metalbroadcaster.\r\nI've been looking for a typeface to use that is
  legible in small sizes on-screen, and has enough character when larger.\r\nMore
  specifically, I'd love to use either Friz Quadrata or Denver, but I'm unsure if
  these will be legible enough though they do fit the feel I need. Can you help me
  out?\r\n\r\nJulian\r\n "

  body: 'Friz Quadrata is available for @font-face licensing, btw. I''m not sure how
    well hinted it is, so you''ll have to do some testing. Also, I don''t think the
    Web Fontfonts hold up under poor conditions: e.g. Greyscale rendering, which is
    still used on a significant number of computers. I''d love to be proven wrong
    though.'

  body: What do you mean by broadcaster? @font-face really only makes sense for websites
    (and possibly apps).
