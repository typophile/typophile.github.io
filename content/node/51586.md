  way how letters are experienced.\r\nThis started when I got asked by an artist (also
  a student) how we as designers experience the interrelation of type and image in
  a design. Do we supplement image with type? Or do we treat image and type equally?\r\n\r\nPersonally
  I experience type as an image. As a graphic designer, I play with composition and
  I \u2018have\u2019 to see type merely formal. \r\nNow I would like to know how other
  designers experience (personally) the essence of letters. Do you look at these from
  a purely functional point of view \u2014 a tool to communicate? Or do you relate
  them as images on their own?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Both! The intention of letterforms is to communicate visually. The forms themselves
    have meaning, but at the same time, they should be legible, otherwise they have
    no function or meaning. The same concept applies to images, as images should also
    have meaning. Type is just as important as images, because they both have form,
    and they are both manipulated in different sizes, shapes, colours, structure,
    etc. The beauty of good design is to make it all work together.

  body: "I vacilate between seeing words and seeing the shapes or counterforms of
    individual letters. Once I started designing fonts things really started to change,
    because I\u2019ve got this massive list of problems with my fonts floating around
    in my head, and sometimes I\u2019m just walking along and <strong>BOOM I GET GOBSMACKED</strong>
    by letters that solve some problem I didn\u2019t figure out on my own (or didn\u2019t
    even know was a problem!). And I\u2019m slowly shifting into seeing the white
    spaces on their own, because in some of the best type those white spaces are a
    hell of a lot better looking and more interesting than the black."
