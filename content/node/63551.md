body: "Two nights ago my wife and I carved some pumpkins with our little one. Even
  though [[http://typophile.com/battle19||this type battle]] was long past, I decided
  to render our house number in the style of a particular font. I did it freehand,
  and with admittedly poor tools (and then took blurry images of it!), but I think
  it came out passably enough that someone should be able to ID it.\r\n\r\nAny takers?
  (BTW, this is solely for my own validation as a pumpkin carver.)\r\n\r\nI'll also
  admit that the kerning is kind of off :(\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12943_526106691436_62500461_31179106_7154569_n_5623.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12943_526106696426_62500461_31179107_1622278_n_6680.jpg]"
