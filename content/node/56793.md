  book on optical sizes</a> has been published.\r\n\r\nIt is very type designer-centric
  so I guess it may be of interest for many people here.\r\n\r\nOn the ATypI website
  you can see my <a href=\"http://atypi.org/eventfiles/StPetersburg_Ahrens_OpticalSizes_paper.pdf\">paper
  for the St Petersburg conference</a>, which gives you a foretaste. "

    the video.

    side: this is the definitive source for all optical sized font specimens. There
    are nice samples that take up a big chunk of the book... \r\n\r\nSo everyone out
    there working on optical sizes now, start hoping for a second edition :)\r\n\r\nBest

  body: "Claus[es],\r\nI have just been informed by the publisher that they do ship
    outside North America.\r\nYou can select any US state. Since the order is processed
    by humans (and the credit card will not be charged by an automatism) they will
    ignore that.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick,\r\nsorry, I was not aware of your work when I did
    my research (which was 3 years ago). I know it must be frustrating if your work
    is not recognised. However, consider it was originally an MA thesis and I worked
    under time pressure. There are other designers I missed or was unable to contact.\r\nThe
    book and the sample section is by no means complete. However, it is probably still
    by far the most comprehensive paper on the subject."
