body: Hey I am designing a typeface to mimic handwriting. I know everyone has done
  this before but I need it for a project. What I am wanting to know is if there is
  a way in Fontlab that will randomly insert different characters like 3 different
  a's throughout the document. Or if you know a typeface that already does this I
  will take that.
