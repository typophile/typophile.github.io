  group for such a long time now and just keep going round in circles!\r\nI need to
  just settle on a logo so i can start working on the rest of the 'brand space'.\r\n\r\nPlease
  give me any critique or advice you can.\r\n\r\nIts for a string group who play for
  weddings and functions. The things i'm trying to get across - \r\nclassy, lots of
  experience (there main USP), wide range of music, approachable.\r\n\r\nThis mark
  will either be made into a stamp, or embossed with foil or ink. It's for my family
  so we can always make a change in a year or so if its not working out. Also almost
  anything would be better than what we have now!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WrWxNyxmHn4/Tef0iEVNDFI/AAAAAAAAAIk/MqktK5kMAKM/s400/circle%2Blogo2.png"

  body: "It's pretty nice, but unfortunately my first thought upon seeing it was that
    it was for a pasta company - the curved musical staffs made me think of some kind
    of hybrid macaroni/rigatoni. Maybe adding another line would make them read as
    musical staffs (although that might make them hard to use at small sizes)? Or
    put some musical notation in them (that is probably a bad idea)?\r\n\r\nThis is
    just one non-professional person's first impression, so don't throw out your idea
    until you get more feedback.\r\n"

  body: "haha, thanks Mugford interesting thought with the pasta! you've just made
    me aware of my major mistake, so much for learning to read music for 8 years.
    I'll try and print it with 5 lines and see what its like. For the really small
    sizes I had planned to simplify it to 2 or 3 lines anyway so it wont make a difference
    for that.\r\n\r\nIf anyone sees anything else that's wrong, kerning or type placement
    etc please let me know\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the fluidity to it, yet the first impression I got of the logo was
    one of a coffee shop. I think the type may need to be a bit more of a contemporary
    calligraphic font to employ that classy, approachable and experienced look. \r\n\r\nYet
    I say the same as mugford, this is just one non-professional person's first impression.\r\n"

  body: i get a similar feeling. wondering if you could incorporate the 'strings'
    of an instrument in the 'C' or some other letter form. i like simplicity of it,
    just needs little touch somewhere. =)

    string instruments' bodies.\r\n<img src=\"http://i2musics.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/violin.jpg\"

  body: "Your logo is round. Therefore I see great logo applications.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\nWhen
    you buy new strings, they often package them in a smal paper bag. I can just see
    your round logo in a round sticker sealing the bag. It will be very elegant.\r\n\r\nI
    don's mean to push you. I just really like your original design.\r\n\r\n"
