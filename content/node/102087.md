  body: "That's brilliant, thanks. Really appreciate such an amazingly quick and accurate
    response. Amazone looks spot on. I'm sure that redford is a times font but all
    the times variants I've looked at seem to have the cross-bar on the f much nearer
    the top than mine. I'd appreciate any thoughts you may have on this.\r\n"
