  body: "Looks like a 50's appliance logo to me.  I don't know if Rocket Script or
    Air Conditioner are appropriate for a logo (or for your client,) but they might
    compliment that graphic well. \r\n\r\nSome constructive criticism; the fact that
    the angles of the triangles (two above, one below) do not match bothers my eye."
