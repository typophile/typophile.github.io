  body: You're going to hate me because I really want to like this typeface and I
    think the gimmick is quite useful for packaging and advertising but I can't help
    but think of Comic Sans when I look at your samples. I've given it a few weeks
    since I first saw your PDF and I still can only think of Comic Sans. Sorry!

    that if typographers can make subtle choices between, say, two flavours of Garamond,
    so apply that level of discrimination to the process of making outlines and special
    effects. Sure, that stuff is kinda flakey, and I'm playing to it a bit, but what
    the heck."
