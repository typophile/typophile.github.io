  a few type suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe theme of my menu is that of TWA Moonliner due
  to the shop when it was still open was below the TWA building in KCMO.  Any suggestions
  on supportive type I could use for the menu, I was using Futura but now not really
  liking it \r\n\r\nI am also on a very small budget for this project, it being a
  re-do for school project. for portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

    mean but on the <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/type/\">Veer</a> site they
    have a '1960s Style' category under the 'type' tab.\r\n\r\nOn the <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/1960s/fonts/\">MyFonts</a>
    site you can search 1960s."

    Missouri and Moonliner can be seen at the following wiki article.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the input.  Will take a look at the sites, and see what comes up.\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Moonliner]]"

  body: "It sounds like the Moonliner had a bit of a \"space age\" theme. If you haven't
    already, you might want to look into Googie architecture for more ideas. Some
    of the stuff might be too spacey, but it's from the right time period, so you
    might find some stuff that provides inspiration.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie_architecture\r\n\r\nClarendon
    would definitely be a good choice, but it's seen a big resurgence lately, so you
    might want to go in another direction to avoid looking like Ruby Tuesday or something
    like that."
