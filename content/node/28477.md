body: "hi guys!\r\n\r\nI'm currently in the process of designing a logo for a local
  architect who's got about 20 years of experience but finally decided to start his
  own bureau.\r\n\r\nHis area of activity reaches from building small hospitals to
  large casinos and it's currently a one-man business but he's NOT aiming to become
  a 50 people agency anyway..\r\n\r\nHe wanted his logo to be mainly typography which
  should be clean, corporate looking and shouldn't be embarrassing. The only shape
  or form I'm allowed to use is a square due to his vision of a square being the ultimate
  form, undistorted and straightforward.\r\n\r\nthe concept I came up with can be
  seen here\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stefan_4698.jpg]\r\n\r\nSTEFAN
  is placed in capitals to distuingish itself from \"architect\" and to make clear
  that the architect is called stefan...\r\nthe squares between the text are pretty
  small so that the don't stand out too much and they're seperated into 3 pieces to
  give the impression of something being built..\r\nthey also form an arrow pointing
  upwards to intensify the impression of something going on..\r\n\r\nwhat do you think
  so far?\r\n\r\nany c&c appreciated\r\ncheers mike"

  body: "There is something about the relationship between the two words \u2013 Stefan
    is not quite short enough to match the x-height of architekt (I should say this
    image size makes it difficult to be sure). I would also say the FA of Stefan and
    the hi of architekt need to be kerned slightly tighter. The squares don't sit
    comfortably with the type, perhaps if the top of the bottom square was flush with
    the x-height/cap height and moved slightly to the left. Again this is affected
    by screen/image size but the lowercase seems to have quite a rambling baseline,
    where the rounded characters overshoot and the dot of the i seems too prominent.\r\nWhen
    reversed out is it your intention to use that rectangular shape or is that just
    an example?\r\nTim"

  body: It looks pleasant, but the vertical stroke of the T needs to be aligned with
    the square, not the terminal. I'd also like to see the text aligned with the outer
    edge of the stroke as opposed being inside the square. Having it inside the square
    creates a good tension between the letter and the gap, but penetration would be
    more dynamic.

  body: "Yellow frame = National Geographic.\r\n\r\nI'd think about changing the colour
    of the frame. Also, maybe align the left edge of the stems of the 'T' and 'N'
    to the left edge of the frame border, rather than the right edge of the stems
    to the left edge of the frame border (I hope that makes sense).\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "hi guys! The problem is that it's nearly impossible to convince the client
    of a different colour.. he is so satisfied with the yellow (which actually comes
    from concept number 1) because no political party in austria has got yellow as
    \"their\" colour.. ans since he's worried about being pushed into a political
    direction with choosing a different colour.. yellow is theonly option for him.\r\nPersonally
    I don't think that the yellow frame is such a huge problem because National Geographic
    is barely known in Austria..\r\n\r\ncheers mike"

    Geographic at first glance. I also like the colourways, the brightness of the
    yellow is offset by the charcoal greys and works well. It looks contemporary and
    quite sophisticated and I think it suits the subject matter really well.\r\n\r\nDon't
    worry about the National Geographic, sure they employ a yellow frame, but it's
    rectangular not square; they're also in a completely different area of business.\r\n\r\nNice
    work!"

    if a door was added to the opening? '

    I DO think 'National Geographic' is known in Austria, as well. <em>(And, I also

    There actually IS a political party in Austria related to 'Yellow': 'Liberales

  body: "Hang on... the thing is, when a logo is posted on this forum, you're crucially
    seeing it <em>out of context</em>. The very fact that the word architect is part
    of the logo should mark it out as an architect's practice to the vast majority
    of people. I don't think if you saw a business card with the logo on you would
    think that it had some kind of bizarre architect/National Geographic affiliation.
    Sorry, can't see it myself.\r\n\r\n\"When you think about it, it\u2019s pretty
    scary that architects design the buildings we use.\" Wow. That's really deep,
    Hrant! I think I'd be more scared if architects <em>hadn't</em> designed the buildings
    we use."
