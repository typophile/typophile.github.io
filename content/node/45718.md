body: "Where should I go to submit bug complaints about certain major fonts like Times,
  Times New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Palatino, and the like?\r\n\r\nBasically, my
  complaint is that none of these major fonts has proper support for a particular
  combining diacritic, which nonetheless they all provide the glyph for. I\u2019m
  referring specifically to U+0331 COMBINING MACRON BELOW,  which I need for text
  in the Tlingit language. All of these fonts in their latest flavors from Microsoft
  or Apple actually provide the glyph and codepoint, but none of them position the
  diacritic with anything even close to accuracy. Contrast this with Lucida Grande,
  Charis SIL, or even Jazz LET, for a few examples.\r\n\r\nThe reason this bothers
  me (instead of \u201Cjust use a font that works!\u201D) is because I\u2019m working
  to get keyboard layouts and input methods done for Tlingit on both current flavors
  of Windows and Mac OS X. If the system fonts don\u2019t even support the text properly
  it\u2019s going to be a big PITA for me to explain to users.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t
  be so let down if the glyphs weren\u2019t provided at all. But as it stands, they\u2019re
  there but essentially nonfunctional. So who do I complain to?"
