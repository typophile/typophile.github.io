body: this typeface is inspired by native american pottery painting. i&#39;m going
  for a hand-painted, geometric feel. i believe it looks kind of hieroglyphicish,
  if you will. any suggestions and comments would be greatly appreciated! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27818.jpg"

  body: 'I think the key to making this worthwhile is the type of &#34;finish&#34;
    you apply to it. If you just make all the parts straight lines it would make it
    boring. But I&#39;m not comfortable recommending a &#34;weathered&#34; look. Maybe
    if you looked at Ancient Greek inscriptions, like in here: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/grklapid.gif"

  body: That is so cool! Bravo. <BR> <BR>It will be tough to read when not in aphabetical
    order &#40;see G, S,  <BR>5 or Z, 8 combos&#41;, but you wont be setting a novel
    in it. It would  <BR>make for a cool logo. <BR> <BR>Made me think of ST

  body: Thanks for the comments.  Hrant- I like your example of the Greek incription
    and it is a direction I&#39;ve thought of going. However, my original intent was
    to convey a hand-painted feeling rather than carved.  Hopefully you can see that
    a little bit better at a larger size? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27883.jpg"
