body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Display Fonts</strong>\r\n\r\nDisplay
  fonts are fonts primarily designed to be used in \"display\" (headlines, titles
  and so forth) rather than for long-distance text.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nLike most categorisations
  of type, the category of \"display\" fonts is flexible. Some fonts are \"display\"
  fonts because they are flamboyant or quirky, typographical peacocks; but careful
  designers and foundries will often produce \"display\" versions of text fonts, which
  are likely to be just as sober as the text font, but are designed to be used at
  large sizes. Such versions are likely to feature adjustments to [[X-height|x-height]],
  stroke weight and [[Fit|letterfitting]] which help them look and read their best
  at larger sizes.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, display fonts are best used for larger
  settings, such as headlines and titles. They can also be used for short paragraphs
  where immersive or lengthy reading is not required. \r\n\r\nFor better readability,
  long-running copy for such things as brochures, magazines and web sites use a [[Text
  Fonts|text font]]."
