body: "So two months ago I did this typographic mashup of black history after Obama
  won.\r\n\r\nYou can see it here, http://www.wallstats.com/blog/389-years-ago/\r\n\r\nIt
  became really popular so I decided to redo it and make a poster out of it.\r\nThe
  reason for redoing it are two.  1, because it's too long to be printed in current
  form, over 12 feet, so it needs to be compacted, and 2, the typography kinda sucks
  as I didn't pretty quickly and didn't expect much attention.\r\n\r\nSo the final
  product will be screen printed at 16'' x 48'' which means it has to be compacted
  as well as other limitations of screen printing.  Nothing too small, heavy weights
  in smaller sizes, no small serifs.\r\n\r\nI am about 25% through it and wanted to
  get some critique from y'all.\r\n\r\nSome things I can concerned about are:  Is
  it easy to follow each fragment?  Being so compact I had to use three colors to
  break it up and orginize it.  Also, there are some 'gaps' in there.  I really couldn't
  just fill the entire space with type, too hard logistically.  Do these gaps detract
  from the design or do they give the eye some breathing room and alternate focus?
  \ I also have not done any kerning or tracking yet, I guess I should do that right?
  \ Like the LA in 'SLAVE CODES'.  Any other general thoughts would be ok.\r\n\r\nThe
  image is only a crop, it will be much longer.  I also am using Frutiger exclusively
  and laying it all out in Photoshop because it's faster for me.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophiletest_4332.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  image is also here http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/5622/typophiletestpk3.gif\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    comb. There are typos here.

  body: Are you using a baseline grid? I think that would really help you get some
    alignment that is missing.
