		<div class="commentbody">I had a discussion with a big wig at the publishing company that bought MIS Press. They have no intention of reprinting the book and they have no intention to allow permission to copy the books contents in any format even though a copy of the book cannot be located. <BR> <BR>What's frustrating is that the book is very very good and as relevant today as it was when it was written due to Fontographer not seeing an update in lo these many years. <BR> <BR>I wrote several e-mails to Stephen with no reply and I'm not sure if there is any way to share the fantastic information that is contained within this book. Any ideas? It's as good as you think it is. <BR> <BR>Funny side note, I found a copy of the book on eBay right after as the auction ended and the seller was thrilled to get $15 for what he felt was &quot;dry and bording&quot; <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant: I'm not saying it's fair. Jared just asked what the law says. I think the publisher is being short-sighted and will tarnish it's reputation with stubborn practices like this. Hopefully, Mr. Moye will negotiate a better contract next time. <BR> <BR>Stuart: The information in the book is not copyrightable &ndash; that is, the ideas are not protected, just the actual expression of them. You can share the same ideas in your own words with your own examples. Mr. Moye could re-express the same ideas in new ways and possibly publish a new book on the same topic (with another publisher, undoubtedly). <BR> <BR>There is, of course, a gray area where new expression of old ideas and plagiarism meet. My point is, just because a bull-headed publisher refuses to reprint (which I can understand) or to give permission (which I can't necessarily agree with) doesn't mean that the information is lost or trapped.  <BR> <BR>Disclaimer: I'm not a copyright attorney, nor have I ever played one on TV. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

This past year I have lost several amazing titles such as Tolleson Design's book, Why Not associates, DR's catalog for Murrey &amp; Vern, Vaughn Olivers Visceral Pleasures, etc. An easy $300 worth.
