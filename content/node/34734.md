    the lc thorn has a certain problem, in that -especially in fonts\r\nthat have
    very short descenders- it looks unbalanced. What do people\r\nthink of making
    its ascender a bit short, possibly to the height of the\r\n\"t\" or the dot of
    the \"i\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    via email regarding eths. Some type-designers are very nice and fix the eth after
    I point it out and send jpg samples for comments. Other have given me lectures
    about how people like Gunnlaugur Briem don't know how to design fonts and refuse
    to accept that their eth is wrong. Seriously, I've gotten emails from two of the
    \"top\" type-designer that try and dispute me.\r\n\r\neth is a tough one due to
    the fact that it's only used in Iceland and Faroe Islands (as I know of)\r\nI
    don't blame people for designing it wrong but I try and point it out when i can
    and hopefully designers will remember some guy sending them an email nagging about
    some eths or maybe see something about this on Typophile ;) \r\nWas going to send
    David Berlow/Font Bureau a note on this.\r\n\r\nSigur\xF0ur \xC1rmannsson has
    some notes on making eths as well: http://font.is/?p=7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nOscar

    have any image of a spread.\"\r\nFB TG and Miller are the fonts they use. \r\n\r\n<em>The
    sign of eth is rising in the air.</em>\r\n\r\n\"If it\u2019s so wrong, how come
    David Berlow doesn\u2019t know what \u201Ceth\u201D should look like? Strange...\"\r\nA
    thousand fonts might show, but if you don't look, you'll never know. ;)\r\n\r\nI
    simply asked myself, \"Can't a voiced dental fricative <strong>wave</strong> <em>once</em>
    in a while?\"\r\nOr must it remain erect whilst the entire lower cavity of ones
    head vibrates? I felt not, and I think this design, radical as it may seem, is
    better than the look of a straight bar. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, being but a humble
    English-speaking tool-maker I'm not in the business of denying whatever erect
    and proper traditions whatever people require of whatever letters I make and I
    had no intention of crossing Briem or anyone else on Icelandic issues. If any
    Faroese, Icelanders, Anglo-Saxons, medieval Scandinavians, iconophiles or customers
    of any kind need this to be straightened out, by all means, when ordering FBTG
    add a note to \"please Briem-o-matic l.c. eth\". Same as if already purchased,
    we guarantee our eth as if our very eths were at stake.\r\n\r\n\"FF Clan, though
    it\u2019s more modern.\"\r\nOne of the other things I asked myself long before
    I got the eth, is \"Isn't it time for some nice display sans that <em>do not</em>
    have gigantic lowercases?\"\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
