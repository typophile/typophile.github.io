body: I'm looking for help in identifying the font used in the logo for [[http://designspiration.net/image/73721785281/|Lincoln
  Supply Co]]. It has a vintage industrial feel, yet I'm almost certain it was a tad
  modified to give it a worn look. Feedback and help is highly appreciated, thank
  you.

    United]] (Sans Regular Black) to me.

  body: That looks very close. I just emailed House to see if they can confirm. Hopefully
    it is the one. Thanks Ryuk!

  body: "I don't think HI will. The only person that would answer is the author [[http://www.bsley.com|Jeremy
    Paul Beasley]] himself. But I doubt he'll answer as type choice is a main part
    of his design process...\r\nI guess I could find more similars if you still need
    more options."

  body: "This is what I heard back from HI \"It looks like it could have been United
    Sans Reg Black once upon a time, before someone gave it that worn rounded look.\"\r\n\r\nMy
    guess is that it is United. I'm going to see if I can find other similar type
    faces to compare to United. I like that the typeface used by Beasley is not tall,
    but a tad short and compact."

  body: 'This one has too much similarities with United, it can''t be something else.
    United has 5 width variations from Condensed to Extended. I guess you could find
    the right one for your project. I''ll try today to help the cause posting some
    alternatives to United but remember they''re not it. 2 at the moment: [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=liberator|Liberator]]
    and [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=haymaker|Haymaker]]'

  body: "Ryuk, thank you for the information and your help. I think I will stick with
    United. I have Haymaker but don't care for the spurs (I think that's what they're
    called). I don't want to modify it either, but Liberator looks nice and I may
    consider it for future use. \r\n\r\nSide note: Do you know of a type face close
    to the one featured here: http://jenbpeters.com/Billabong\r\nIs it custom/hand
    drawn or a commercial font? I'm interested in that for a side project, just unsure
    of the name. I may email a request to the designer, but thought I'd ask here first.
    \r\n\r\nThank you for your time!"

  body: Even if letters look quite identikal, I'd really doubt it could be something
    else than a handwritten font. I'd try to find for you some alternatives, may be
    tomorrow. Have a look [[http://typophile.com/node/103749#comment-557064|here]],
    there might be some interesting.

  body: Ryuk, I saw the [[http://typophile.com/node/103749#comment-557064|list you
    posted]]. I like Meat from YWFT. Thanks for the help! A long while back I was
    looking for one that Oakley was using on some campaigns and I think it was a custom
    handwritten font, possibly.
