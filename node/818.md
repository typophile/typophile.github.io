    <BR> <BR>Some comments: <BR> <BR>The angle you use consistently throughout the
    face is successful. It gives the face a unique feel. There are some places where
    it doesn&#39;t quite work for me, though. For example, it works on the c and the
    e, but doesn&#39;t work on the B or the D. You might try straightening out the
    bottoms and keeping the slant on the tops of the B and the D. It works really
    well on the P and the R.  <BR> <BR>The &#39;s&#39; needs some work. It looks like
    the inconsistency on the bottom is supposed to relate to the c,t,g,e etc, but
    it doesn&#39;t communicate that relationship very well. Maybe slant the top of
    the s at the same angle, or ditch the slant on the bottom. <BR> <BR>The misalignment
    of the v and the w are too subtle; they look like a mistake instead of a choice.
    I would leave them off. <BR> <BR>The tail on the y doesn&#39;t relate to its body.
    I would shorten the cross bar on the G; it creates on awkward space. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    with max on the f. It could work if it were opened up. The w isn&#39;t consistent
    with the rest of the face; the space on the right is really jarring. <BR> <BR>Good
    start. This is a face worth polishing.  <BR> <BR>cr '

    The quirks in the face work well,  <BR>but in the F and f something is off. &#40;Perhaps
    the  <BR>top arm extends too far?&#41; <BR> <BR>Very nice. I think this could

  body: ' I have seen several of the typographic elements that are going on in work
    by Darren Scott. I liked this type of work a lot when I first saw it but there
    is too much of it on the market these days.I like the idea but it just doesn&#39;t
    quite work yet. Perhaps too many things are going on.  <BR>A bit of Sibylle Hagmanns&#39;
    Cholla, some Darren Scotts&#39;Hydrate or Aggregate, etc. I would keep going with
    this design by simplification. Think about userbility and consider eliminating
    or toning down some of the untraditional elements. '
