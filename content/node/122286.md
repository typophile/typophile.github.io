body: "I need to insert the Osage alphabet (currently under ballot) here, and I can,
  but when I do, it doesn't display properly, at least in Apple's Font Book. \r\n\r\nSince
  you don't have an Osage font installed is analagous to\r\n\r\nABCDEFGHIJKLM<space>\r\nNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<space>\r\nabcdefghijklm<space>\r\nnopqrstuvwxyz<space>\r\n\r\nIn
  Apple's Font Book though this always displays with tiny tiny letters when \"Fit\"
  selected. Is there some way I can insert a code for a hard return in place of or
  after the <space> above so that Font Book might display it properly?"
