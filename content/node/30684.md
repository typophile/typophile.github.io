  body: I think so too. Somebody had some fun with Poplar, either the designer of

    Raeder\r\n</a>\r\n\r\naccording to the site: \"Book design for Asta Gr\xF6ting,
    including the 'Inner Voice' font.\" .. and then \"The 'Inner Voice' font is based
    on classic theater poster fonts but with the task in mind, that it has been swallowed
    by one of the puppets and got stuck inside their throat.\"\r\n\r\nso I'm guessing
    it's custom"
