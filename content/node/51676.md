  Full address, cell / mobile #, fax #, 1-800 #, home phone #, work #, website, email,
  maybe even a father company like ReMax and their address and THEIR phone #s - how
  can all of this fit well on a business card? \r\n\r\nMy question is this: is there
  a typeface that works well in a small type size that can convey all of this information
  (or at least half of it)? \r\n\r\nI've used Scala Sans in the past and love it but
  I start to cringe when it gets below 7pt. There's also Unibody by Underware but
  it seems too tech-y. \r\n\r\nSorry for the long-winded post, thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Uh, sorry but why are you setting that text at 7pt? I wouldn't go any smaller
    than 9-10pt tops.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 types of business cards... fancy ones and
    useful ones. Sadly, Real Estate cards fall into the latter category. So, you'll
    have to get clever if you want to create a well-designed but still useful business
    card. \r\n\r\nHave you considered icons or abbreviation, instead of extra text?
    Also consider condensed versions of a font over a reduced type size. Business
    cards need to be readable, sadly that is one of that caveats of designing them.\r\n\r\nYou
    might also want to consider a font with a fairly large x-height and contrast,
    so you can use a smaller text size while not reducing readability.\r\n\r\nHave
    you tried a vertical layout as well? There are also options when it comes to printing...
    a folded card, doubles the amount of space... and allows for a more stylish design.
    Even printing double sided can open up room.\r\n\r\nConsider your other options
    before resorting to reduced readability. "

  body: "Thanks Asvetic. Those are great ideas!\r\n\r\nI didn't mean to let that on
    that my intent was to reduce readability as to fit everything. That'd be silly
    / poor design. Sorry if that was confusing. Instead, I have found typefaces that
    work in small point sizes (e.g. 7pt) AND are still highly readable (like Unibody).
    I was wondering what other fonts there like that. I feel as though that must be
    a category of fonts that I am just unaware of. \r\n\r\nI like the condensed idea,
    and I hadn't considered looking for a typeface with a large x-height and contrast
    - any specific recommendations? \r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: "Well, if I were to suggest some fonts, I think Hoelfer & Frere-Jones have
    a few nice ones. Like Mercury or Chronicle. I also like Gerard Unger's Swift.
    All have nice large x-heights and suitable contrast.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking
    for a sans I'd suggest, Jeremy Tankard's Bliss or Benton Sans by Morris Fuller
    Benton, or even Vista Sans at Emigre.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the direction you're
    going style wise, so it's hard to really suggest something and know if it's suitable
    for what you're trying to do. I know you said you like Scala Sans, that has nice
    contrast, but the x-height isn't super large, so going small like 7pt will be
    difficult to read.\r\n\r\nA word to the wise, if you mix condensed with regular,
    you can get some very nice contrasts between information. A line like \"Phone:
    (123) 456-7890\", you'd use a bold condense for the \"Phone:\" and a regular non-condense
    for the numbers, if they're old-style numbers, even better. \r\n\r\nWell used
    color, even muted, can also help make important data pop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    could be turned into icons?  A mobile phone, a fax machine, etc.  Maybe that would
    reduce the word clutter and give you an opportunity to make the card interesting?
