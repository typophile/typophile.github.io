  We use Minion Pro and Myriad Pro, but all I can find is nine common vulgar fractions.
  We need more. When we export xml from Indesign CS3, the vulgar fractions look good
  on our website, without needing anything done to them using CSS. Is there a way
  to build or buy a more complete set that included 13/16, 15/16, etc.\r\nThanks"

    now we're exporting text from the print version to be used in an online catalog.
    If we build the fraction from the open type menu, it reverts back to numeral slash
    numeral after we export it from Indesign as xml. Then the website developers apply
    some CSS styling to make it look like the original diagonal fraction. But it doesn't
    look as good.\r\n\r\nWhen we export one of the few common glyph fractions, it's
    exported as a single unit and doesn't get exported as a numeral slash numeral.
    It looks good as is, and the web site developers don't need to apply any special
    CSS formatting. So I was hoping to find extended glyph packages for fractions,
    or learn how to make a fraction using the open type menu, and then convert it
    to a form that would not come apart during export."

    point in creating more fractions -- they would only appear on your screen, using
    your own (adjusted) font.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are not than many preset Unicode
    code points for vulgar fractions: <a href=\"http://unicode-search.net/unicode-namesearch.pl?term=fraction\">a
    list of code points containing 'fraction'</a>. So you would need to add your characters
    into the PUA segment -- and if so, you cannot use <em>any other</em> font than
    your own."

  body: "As Theunis said, there's only a handful of fractions encoded in Unicode.
    If you need to exchange information reliably (i.e. without using PUAs) and also
    want the fractions to be encoded in the text as a single character, you're limited
    to that set.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can get somewhat decent arbitrary fractions (e.g.
    13/16, 15/16) by using superscript and subscript characters \u2014 the ones in
    the [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2070.pdf|2070\u2013209F range]] plus
    the 1, 2 and 3 superior in the [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf|0080\u201300FF
    range]] \u2014 separated by the fraction character (U+2044).\r\n\r\nSo, something
    like this: &#x00B9;&#x00B3;&#x2044;&#x2081;&#x2086;  &#x2076;&#x2076;&#x2044;&#x2087;&#x2088;\r\n\r\nIt's
    far from perfect since the glyphs used are the superiors and inferiors, instead
    of the numerators and denominators."

  body: "Tim: You could have a full set of numerators and denominators accessible
    with Opentype (type \u201C1234/5678\u201D, select the text and choose \u201Cfraction\u201D
    in the OT menu). That would work fine in Indesign but not on the web. The problem
    is lacking cross browser support for OT features and no Unicode definition for
    the glyphs you need to build arbitrary fractions. \r\n\r\nMy proposal is to draw
    one or two fonts with numerators/denominators instead of the regular figures in
    the same style as Verdana, and just change the fonts using CSS. The code on your
    website would look something like this,\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;span class=\"numr\"&gt;1234/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
    class=\"dnom\"&gt;5678&lt;/span&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nand automatically convert 1234/5678

  body: I had a look at the system fonts the Mac, and none of them have a consistent
    set of superior and inferior figures that could be used for making fractions.
    Lucida Grande is close, but the superiors for 1 - 4 don't align with those for
    5 - 8.

    knowledge  to work from! I'll be gentle, then.\r\n\r\nUnicode is the (or, maybe
    just a) way of defining which characters are defined by which code. It all started
    with ASCII (and before that, EBDIC, but I haven't seen that used for, oh, 25 years?):
    the code for an \"A\" is 65, for a \"B\" is 66, and so on, for the regular alphabet
    as well as numbers. Unicode attempts to expand that to be able to encode (arguably)
    every written code system, and for that it needs lots of codes. \"Code point\"
    is the name computer geeks give to, uhm, a certain code at a certain point, as
    in \"The code point for lowercase alpha is hex 3b1\".\r\n\r\n<cite>We are not

    think I understand why some of our answers leave you bewildered. <strong>Opentype</strong>
    is not a web-format. It's a font file format, and designed to provide definitions
    for a font in its own file. Therefore, if you ask your users to use Verdana, all
    you can use on your web page is Verdana. You cannot 'add' Opentype features --
    other than adding them to the <em>font file</em> named \"Verdana.ttf\" and putting
    that on your web site for download. (And that'd <em>not</em> be a good solution,
    because firstly, it would be illegal, and secondly, people would need to download
    and install the font before looking at your web site.) (I'll skip Web font solutions
    for now, as I don't know squat about those.)"
