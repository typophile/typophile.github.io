  here's a photo of some lettering on a plaque -- I believe the date is around 1904,
  certainly no later than 1910.  I'm hoping to find a font that's somewhat similar
  so that I don't have to spend a bunch of time tracing letters on a crappy photograph.
  \ The ones suggested by TypeNavigator and IdentiFont aren't really fitting the bill:\r\n\r\nAlinea
  Incise -- to variable in letter weight, and the O isn't perfectly round\r\nLinotype
  Aroma\u2122 Regular -- The M is missing that lovely point, and the O isn't perfectly
  round\r\nAvant Garde Demi -- has the right O, but not much else\r\n\r\nThe closest
  one I found is Futura medium or demi -- I could probably work with these and modify
  the width of some of the letters, as well as change around the E.  However, I do
  love those gently opened Us.  \r\n\r\nAnyways, if anyone has any other ideas, I'd
  love to hear them!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBeth"

    a sufficient basis. Even the \"S\" seems to match in terms of slight wobbliness.\r\n\r\nOr
    wait, what about this:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/superla/\r\nReleased
    just 19 days ago! (Although apparently the original is from the GDR days.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/superla/|Superla]] from Primetype
    looks quite similar in shape, except that the crotch of the M is not pointed.
    It's unfortunate that your sample shows so few helpful letters from an ID point
    of view. For example, C, G, J and R would be a big help, in addition to the M
    and S in your sample. \r\n\r\nI have to agree that Futura Demi seems a very good
    match for the letters you have shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/spartan/|Spartan]] is a slightly
    different version of Futura, with a wider-looking E, which makes the U look narrower.
    The M crotch is flat, however.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "\"Usoleum\" is the name of a usability blog/portfolio site I'm working on,
    hrant. Obviously I've plucked this from Mausoleum.  :)   I think modifying Futura
    will work just fine, and if I decide to use the above image in the header, I think
    Futura would work well for other title text on the site.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
