  she studied calligraphy under Lloyd Reynolds. At Reynolds' suggestion she took up
  modern dance, eventually studying under Martha Graham in New York. She took a lettering
  class with [[Edward Benguiat|Ed Benguiat]] and eventually received her B.A. from
  Harvard University. In 1978 she began working with Charles Bigelow, another student
  of Reynolds. She took a job with [[Compugraphic|Compugraphic Corp.]] where she learned
  the [[Ikarus]] software. \r\n\r\nHer only formal training in type design was a two
  week course with [[Hermann Zapf]] in 1979. Shortly thereafter she went to work for
  the Heil Co. in Germany as a [[type designer]]. In 1982 Charles Bigelow got a job
  teaching [[type design]] at [[Stanford University]]. Bigelow and Holmes began doing
  contract type design which resulted in the [[Lucida]] family of typefaces, originally
  designed for Scientific American magazine, as well as [[Apple Chancery]]. Approximately
  150 million fonts designed by Bigelow & Holmes are in circulation and have been
  issued with several operating systems including Macintosh and Windows."
