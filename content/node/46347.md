  Barneys Co-op catalogue a couple of seasons ago (probably Spring or Summer '07).
  Any guesses?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barneys_coop_4081.jpg]"

  body: Allison, your JPG appears to be corrupt. The link doesn't work, and I can't
    open the file after downloading it, either.
