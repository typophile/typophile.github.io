If you do want to continue this is has to become absolutely perfect for it to add something to the market, which it is not at moment. Just a few notes:
W is unbalanced and to small.
Z is to wide.
The contrast in width between round letters like the O and &lsquo;normal&rsquo; letters like the V, T, N, etc is to large.</div>

<p>You are both right, this typeface in not meant to be something completely new. However, if I will ever publish this font it will be quite certain open source. And at this time I think there is no comparable free font coming in different optical sizes. So I surely want to learn from this project, but I could also imagine that this font will be used (probably not by professionals). The optical size 24pt can already be used for titles (same purpose as Trajan), I guess.</p>
<p>I agree, that the W is too narrow and I will change that, but unbalanced? Compare it to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/albertina-mt/regular/|Albertina]], I think many fonts have unbalanced W&rsquo;s. (Or am I getting something wrong?)</p>
<p>The widths of the letters are actually quite similar to Minion Pro an if you look at some Garamond fonts (like Garamond No. 8) you will find an even larger contrast in widths between round letters and &lsquo;normal&rsquo; letters.</p>
<p>I will certainly work further on but I think that lowercase letters will not come before christmas.</p>
<p>And thank you clauses for your appreciation of METAFONT. In opposition to this [[http://typophile.com/node/13885|article]] this font shows that it is possible to generate type1 fonts using the METAFONT language (thanks to mf2pt1).</p>

<p>For going from MATAFONT to PostScript there is, besides mf2pt1, METATYPE1 which GUST people developed for their fonts, though, IIRC, they use a certain subset of MATAFONT. I&rsquo;d even an experiment to use directly MetaPost and FontForge to convert Knuth&rsquo;s Punk font to OpenType (but the funny nature of that font makes it a bit special, also the original sources were &ldquo;metapostified&rdquo; prior to my work).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>1996typo could not be more wrong.  I like comparing fonts and the closer to TNR the better.  What is more, the big thing with fonts is the vibe they give the whole written page, not the characteristic of the letters.  I love Futura.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can remember seeing it in a Ladybird book from my childhood.  The O is much wider than the L with its dumb little horisontal, but the the whole font seems so fresh, open and optimistic and without pretense. Those letters give me a good vibe.  So there.</p>
<p>And another thing, I recon it is better if there is variation between different letters.  If they are too in-proportion they look too much the same and readability suffers.  I like Exocet, and it has been prominently used.  The letters in Exocet look very different and don&rsquo;t all follow the same rules.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>AFAIK no one made a real parametrised font with METAFONT except Knuth himself (May be the recent GUST fonts are, but they don&rsquo;t provide METAFONT sources)</cite></p>
<p>I think there are quite some  fonts written in METAFONT which are not by Knuth (look at this [[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/fonts-faq/metafont-list/|list]]). However, many of them belong to the following 3 classes</p>
<ul>
<li> only related to TeX (maths fonts or extensions/improvements to Computer Modern)
<li> not released in any proper outline form
<li> not OpenSource (e.g. fonts from the old Metafoundry)
</ul>
At the first glance I was stunned by the GUST project and the related METATYPE1. I still think they are doing great work but I had to discover that GUST writes the already existing font outlines to a pseudo-abstract form in METATYPE1 language (instead of a proper reenginering by coding means). In addition, METATYPE1 is not very powerful in comparison to METAFONT, and it seems that the language is still under changements. METATYPE1 could produce parametrised fonts, but afaik there is no such font published yet. Even the LatinModern faces make use of the 1990's outlines of Computer Modern instead of the existing METAFONT sources.
<p>mf2pt1 has also some restrictions (but not as severe ones as METATYPE1 has), in particular it has problems with unfilling and drawing commands (Computer Modern mainly &ldquo;defines the outlines&rdquo; and then draws along them with a pen).</p>
<p><cite>Well, I know of other people who are also pursuing the METAFONT approach in order to make better smarter fonts for computer screens</cite></p>
<p>I must admit that I have not cared about pixels/bitmaps for the Nilus typeface.</p>
<p><cite>By the way, does a graphical editor exist for METAFONT or is it all done in code?</cite></p>
<p>I do not know any graphical editor for METAFONT but I also think that this is impossible in general. Personally, I coded the letters and ran METAFONT and gftodvi thousands of time to see how the letters are developping.</p>
<p><cite>Do you have the source posted somewhere? I&rsquo;d really like to see which parameters have manual values, and which are computed from others.</cite></p>
<p>The sources are not published yet and unfortunately there are still a lot of errors in them. &ldquo;Manual&rdquo; values are only</p>
<ul>
<li> slant (italicness, regular has slant=0 and italic has slant=.25)
<li> boldness (regular has boldness=0, bold has boldness 1, light would have boldness -1)
<li> size (optical size)
</ul>
All the rest of the parameters are computed of these with some very easy functions (mainly affine dependencies).
<p><cite>I&rsquo;m a lover of all three TeX, open source, and good old-style text faces</cite></p>
<p>Me too!!!</p>
<p><cite>Then again, I&rsquo;m kinda glad XeTeX/fontspec have allowed us to say goodbye to METAFONT</cite></p>
<p>So am I. The pdf I attached is done with XeTeX. In fact I am too lazy to do experiments with the local texmf tree.</p>
<p><cite>Can you tell me a bit more about what made you use that system?</cite></p>
<p>I love TeX and I find Computer Modern a very good typeface for formulas (but that is probably just because I seldom see something else), but I do not like it for texts. So I often combined &ldquo;good old-style text faces&rdquo; such as URW Garamond No.8 as text typeface with Computer Modern for formulas. Of course, such combinations cannot fit exactly. But I try with Nilus to compose a font that matches well with Computer Modern, which means that capital letter height and x-height are the same. The ascender height of lowercase letters (such as l) is a bit higher than in Computer Modern in order to set the sloped serif to the same height (because Nilus uses a larger serif drop as Computer Modern).</p>
<p><cite>What are your plans for the typeface?</cite></p>
<p>I plan to fill the TeX 8bit encoding scheme (Cork encoding) which is similar to the Adobe Standard encoding.</p>
<p><cite>Have you used outline editors before, and if yes, what is using MF like?</cite></p>
<p>I have been using fontforge for quite a while and it is a great editor, but there are things that a fonteditor never can do (e.g. optical sizes in a sensible way). Using MF is lots of fun for me now and lots of frustration at the very beginning (just like TeX). As I am used to mathematics and programming many things were easy to see for me but could be hard for people who find maths desgusting.</p>
<p><cite>Have you considered joining other efforts or using existent free typefaces as a basis for your work?</cite></p>
<p>I have copied some code from cmbase.mf by Donald Knuth but I have not made use of any existing outline fonts in means of copying traces.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your answers. This encourages me a lot and I have already begun working on lowercase.</p>

<p>This is true for TeX Gyre fonts, but not for their original fonts like Antykwa Półtawskiego which I believe were designed from the beginning as parametrised fonts. They don&rsquo;t usually purplish the metatype sources of the fonts, but you can ask them directly for sources and they will provide it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Sebastian: The U is now a tiny bit narrower, thank you for your advice</p>
<p>I deleted the documentation in the starter of this thread as it is out of date. I will instead publish now and then a new version of nlr10.pdf (in the starter) which contains all current glyphs and makes easy visible how the glyphs are constructed. In some time there will also be a new documentation</p>
<p>Due to some stagnancy in lowercase (&ldquo;e&rdquo; is incredible awful to parametrize with all metaness in mind) and some progress in uppercase (optical correction for diagonal stems with hair width, adjusted serifs for N and U, new ideas about senseful kerning, etc) I decided to interrupt work on lowercase and to improve and complete the uppercase letters.</p>
<p>So here is the rough plan for the font Nilus</p>
<ul>
<li>improvement and completion (Æ,Ø,Þ etc.) of uppercase letters</li>
<li>punctation</li>
<li>make Nilus TDS-compliant (for TeX-users)</li>
<li>publication of experimental font (uppercase only) under restricted license</li>
<li>roman lowercase</li>
<li>roman numbers</li>
<li>italic lowercase</li>
<li>italic numbers</li>
<li>special glyphs</li>
<li>complete kerning</li>
<li>addition of semibold(fast &amp; easy),condensed(probably fast &amp; easy),smallcaps(easy but annoying)</li>
<li>publication of font</li>
</ul>
<p>About publication of experimental font: Does anybody know a license of the form &ldquo;use it freely at your own risk, do not modify, sell or republish&rdquo;?</p>
<p>By the way, I said that I have been working on uppercase and optical sizes, I will prove this here with the following image :-)</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/exa2_3809.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And oh, Nilus is capable of generating font (smoothly) at any optical size (for example 12.24684167 pt) but I recognized (just as many before me as it seems) that there is no need for more than the following point sizes:</p>
<p>72pt (absent in TeX, &ldquo;Display&rdquo; in Adobish, for large titles)
17pt (present in TeX, &ldquo;Subhead&rdquo; in Adobish, for normal headers)
10pt (present in TeX, &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; in Adobish, for normal text and standard math)
8pt (present in TeX, &ldquo;Caption&rdquo; in Adobish, for footnotes and sub/superscript math)
5pt (present in TeX, absent in Adobish, for subsub/supersuperscript math)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll wait for the lowercase to be done before suggesting changes, as you don&rsquo;t seem to be happy with it yourself yet.</p>
<p>As for the license, I think a sentence like the above should be enough. Or try licenses like the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you very much for your appreciation, Sebastian. I have completely forgotten the creative common licenses, CC BY-NC-ND seems to be a good choice for the experimental font. The reason for this &ldquo;restrictive&rdquo; license is that it will probably take much time to complete the whole font. So if I would publish the experimental font under OFL there may be people who decide to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; it and that is something I do not want at all yet.</p>
<p>My wish is to publish the final font under OFL or LPPL. However, this will be in quite some time. If I see that the font is shaping well and a (final) publication is in sight I will consider asking TUG for some grants (<a href="https://www.tug.org/tc/devfund/grants.html">https://www.tug.org/tc/devfund/grants.html</a>) and then Nilus would be naturally free and opensource anyway.</p>

Creating an antiqua font that matches Computer Modern is difficult, so I decided to make Nilus more distinct from Computer Modern and to add a mixture between it: Nilus &ldquo;Modern&rdquo;, which is of course not a modern font.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Nilus has optical corrections (look at the thin diagonal stem of the A), and lower capital heights, lower contrasts, is a bit wider etc.</p>
<p>Nilus is the font intended for book texts, Nilus Modern is intended to be a text font for TeX documents that use Computer Modern math fonts.</p>

<p>If/when you publish this, it would only really make sense
if you leveraged its parametric nature. Either by providing
a ridiculous amount of instances, or maybe by having some
sort of generator that people could use to cook the cut(s)
that they wanted.</p>
<p>Personally I would do this: give away a good number of
instances that cover a lot of usage; but then sell custom
instances based on individual requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is no need for more than the following point sizes</p>

<p>Not necessarily true.
For example in the hotmetal days they made up to 7 masters.
And one can argue for even more.</p>

<p>At the moment, the parametric thing works like this:</p>
<p>A small program fed with very few arguments (e.g. $nl bi 10) creates a file that stores the parametric informations (e.g. nlbi10.mf). These parameters based on some (moredimensional) exponential interpolations.</p>
<p>These nl?.mf files can be processed directly by metafont/metapost. So if one want to change Nilus very strong, one can create an own nl?.mf file where all parameters are defined and process this file afterwards by metafont.</p>
<p>However, Computer Modern has shown that not too many people like to change 60 interdependant parameters of a font (at least not themselves).</p>

AND: I want it too, but I need some (much) time to work on!</p>
<p>@1985 I would recommend to learn METAFONT in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>do NOT look at the sources of Computer Modern! (they are way too complicated for beginners)</li>
<li>read [[http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetafont.tutorial.free.fr%2Fdownloads%2Fmftut.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=mftut&amp;ei=KybETdbtMcf2sgb7j9HEDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHM0elUNcYVKPlI51BhKXr4I36_lQ&amp;cad=rja|the metafont tutorial]]</li>
<li>read the METAFONTbook, at least the first chapters. You will find it in libraries, there are also some (probably illegal?) copies of it in the internet as pdf, but with no pictures (knuth opened the source of the book but didn&rsquo;t make it free)</li>
<li>forget about pens (and the following commands: bot top lft rt)</li>
<li>concentrate on filling, unfilling and penstroke (and the following suffices: r l)</li>
<li>forget about pixelproblems</li>

<li>Still: do NOT look at the sources of Computer Modern! you may look at mflogo (but be aware, it works with pens, but it is a good example for a minimal font)</li>
<li>When you look at the sources of Computer Modern (for serifs, diagonal stems etc), look also at the metafont output too see where the defined points are</li>

<p>I am a mathematician but one can also work with METAFONT with little mathematical knowledge. Basic vector priniciple understandings and basic equation ideas are recommended though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you LexLuengas for this suggestion (and you seem to have very sharp eyes :-)  ). The breve is currently slanted 50% as much as the A. My first language is Swiss German, so I have no ideas about correctly slanting a breve. I often saw it slanted by 100% (respectively to the base glyph) and rarely slanted by 50%. My conclusion was that the font designer which slanted by 100% just did not knew better. What are your reasons to slant it more: Æstetic reasons? Historic reasons? Geometric reasons? Would you suggest to slant it 100% or 75%?</div>

<p>I&rsquo;d say 100% will look fine, but I don&rsquo;t have the faintest idea how it will look trying 75%. Let your eye guide you and take the option that looks better to you.</p>

<p>I see the essence of Knuth&rsquo;s work differently.  To create his fonts, Knuth created a tool that enabled</p>
<ol>
<li> a (relatively) simple way of specifying a curve (this includes interpolation and ensuring (almost) continuous curvature at segment boundaries), and
<li> the ability to generate glyphs programmatically.  This allowed the designer to implement specified relationships between shapes based on a set of parameters.
</ol>
Knuth chose to use Metafont to create fonts by expanding strokes.  However, Metafont (and descendants Metapost and Metatype1) can also be used to programmatically build outlines of glyphs based on parameters.  fujito's creation of Nilus is an excellent demonstration of the power of this approach and these tools.  In fact, Knuth's approach can also be realized without explicitly using Meta*; [[http://typophile.com/node/64835]] shows some preliminary work I did programmatically creating a glyph using only Fontforge's Python interface.
<p>The main difficulty I see with Knuth&rsquo;s approach is something that he also struggled with: how much to parameterize?  If every quantity is specified separately, then you&rsquo;ve lost most of the power of specifying glyphs programmatically.  However, too few parameters, and the glyphs look too &ldquo;cookie-cutter&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s not clear to me that the typographic community has a clear and articulated (mathematical) understanding of the relationships between different features in a well-designed font.  I don&rsquo;t see any reason, though, why such an understanding could not be possible.</p>

<p>I do know this (and that&rsquo;s what I love about Linus&rsquo;s work).
I&rsquo;m in no way stating that the Metafont concept (and certainly not
parametric/generative type design) is misguided. The question,
at least for the moment, is: does Knuth believe/understand that
defining expanded skeletons is non-optimal? I can&rsquo;t see that he
does. And I can&rsquo;t blame him, since most dedicated type designers
don&rsquo;t either! And since his influence is so great*, this is a problem.</p>

<p>Yes, although such an understanding is always necessarily
local (to individuals) and even provisional (over time). But this
is a bug/feature of design anyway. To me parametric/generative
type is the next step up from where we are. It is to instantive
type design what type design is to lettering.</p>

<p>When Knuth and his students worked with Zapf to create AMS Euler in the early 1980s, they decided that it was too difficult to realize Zapf&rsquo;s designs using expansion of strokes.  So the initial implementation of AMS Euler was in Metafont directly constructing the outlines.  As far as I know, Knuth has only been involved in the design and creation of two font families: Computer Modern (and variations) and AMS Euler.  I&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s a stretch that he believes that expanding strokes is optimal for all fonts.</p>

<p>Why is the understanding necessarily local?  I don&rsquo;t see why these principles could not be understood broadly by the whole typographic community.</p>

<p>@hrant: 
<cite>
does Knuth believe/understand that
defining expanded skeletons is non-optimal?
</cite>
I guess, I can see your problem: You do not like the idea of pens. I do not like them neither! Some posts ago I wrote:
<cite></p>
<ul>
<li>forget about pens (and the following commands: bot top lft rt)</li>
<li>concentrate on filling, unfilling and penstroke (and the following suffices: r l)
</cite>
(penstroke is in fact a filling command)</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as can see Knuth was quite convinced of the pen ideas when he wrote the book &ldquo;TeX and METAFONT: New directions in typesetting&rdquo; as the following citation shows:
<cite>
Notice that instead of describing the boundary of the character, as the renaissance geometers did, my METAFONT system describes the curve traveled by the center of the pen, and the shape of this pen is allowed to vary as the pen moves. The main advantage of this approach is that the same definition readily yields a family of infinitely many related fonts of type, each font being internally consistent. The change in pens size is governed by cubic splines in a manner analogous to the motion of the pen&rsquo;s center. In order to define the 20 or so different type fonts used in various places in my books, I need for the most part to use only three kinds of pens, namely (i) a circular pen, used for example to draw dots and at the base of the numeral &lsquo;7&rsquo;; (ii) a horizontal pen, whose shape is an ellipse, the width being variable but the height being constantly equal to the height of a hairline pen - such a pen is used most of the time, and in particular to draw all of the numerale &lsquo;3&rsquo; except for the dots; (iii) a vertical pen, analogous to the horizontal one, used for example to draw the strokes at the bottom of the &lsquo;2&rsquo; and the top of the &lsquo;5&rsquo; and the &lsquo;7&rsquo;.
<img src="/images/old-images/americanmoderndigits_5727.png" alt="">
</cite></p>
<p>The font was a predecessor of the Computer Modern family (written in old METAFONT78) and was obviously only PEN based. But then he rewrote the font completely for the new METAFONT84 and then he used nearly exclusively OUTLINE constructions (pens were only used to draw round edges). I guess somewhere inbetween 1978 and 1984 Knuth &ldquo;understood that defining expanded skeletons is non-optimal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>@sgh:

<p>That&rsquo;s certainly possible. On the other hand, parallel to
what I&rsquo;ve seen/heard from many &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; type designers,
the deviation from what the skeleton would dictate is possibly
being seen by Knuth as a &ldquo;necessary evil&rdquo; of sorts, as a mere
adaptation. If this is true then he&rsquo;s still stuck exploring the

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To my knowledge, there are many essays and long papers Knuth writed and published before he understood font designing. They greatly influenced how people think METAFONT is working.</p>
<p>Actually, these essays are about the old depredated version of METAFONT, now called as something like METAFONT-75. The current METAFONT has great support for manipulating bezier curves.</p>
<p>Actually, Knuth used a mixed approach with defining outlines for most curves and pens for most stems for Computer Modern.</p>
<p>As a domain-specific programming language, METAFONT should offer the most powerful (though unwieldy) expressiveness for a parameterized font, because you can virtually draw anything with it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a meta font doesn&rsquo;t look right, it should be its own problem. Technically METAFONT should be viable as long as the font maker has enough patience, font-making skills and programming knowledge.</p>

Actually, Knuth used a mixed approach with defining outlines for most curves and pens for most stems for Computer Modern.
</cite>
<p>This is not true. For stems Knuth virtually never used pens alone. He practically always defined outlines and filled them (and drew the outline also with a pen):</p>
<p>First citation from the Computer Modern source file romanu.mf (the important command is filldraw which means <strong>filling</strong> and drawing alltogether):
<code>
cmchar &ldquo;The letter I&rdquo;;
beginchar(&ldquo;I&rdquo;,max(6u#,4u#+cap_stem#),cap_height#,0);
italcorr cap_height#*slant-.25u#;
adjust_fit(cap_serif_fit#,cap_serif_fit#);
pickup tiny.nib; pos1(cap_stem,0); pos2(cap_stem,0);
lft x1l=lft x2l=hround(.5w-.5cap_stem); top y1=h; bot y2=0;
filldraw stroke z1e&ndash;z2e; % stem
if serifs: dish_serif(1,2,a,1/3,1.05cap_jut,b,1/3,1.05cap_jut);  % upper serif
dish_serif(2,1,c,1/3,1.05cap_jut,d,1/3,1.05cap_jut);  fi % lower serif
math_fit(0,.5ic#); penlabels(1,2); endchar;
</code></p>
<p>Second citation from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont|Wikipedia]]:
<cite>
More complex fonts such as the Roman text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a small pen to trace around the outline of the visual &ldquo;strokes&rdquo;, which are then filled; the result is much like an outline font, but with slightly softened corners defined by the pen shape.
</cite></p>
<p>And finally a colored image of the letter «I» from cmssbx10, showing the statement above:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/cmssbx10-16_3545.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>if</em> Knuth had really used pens only for the stems, they would behave correctly when being slanted, what they obviously not do:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Y_LMSans10-Oblique_5859.png" alt="">
(The three stems have all different widths, but should have same widths.)</p>

I don&rsquo;t think that would be true even if this weren&rsquo;t a MF typeface. Well, I don&rsquo;t know much about MF but I assumed there is a huge gap in the market for a well thought-out and very expanded (in terms of weights, widths and optical sizes) typeface like this. A typeface like Athelas also doesn&rsquo;t really bring anything new to the table yet I absolutely adore that typeface and it rightfully received an award. Besides, it seems silly to write a font off based on the caps. There&rsquo;s still quite some room for &ldquo;new&rdquo; elements in the lowercase even if many of the rules are already defined by the caps.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s something about the &lsquo;A&rsquo; which I find refreshing. Perhaps the angle of its top is a bit unconventional for an orthodox typeface. In any case I like it a lot.</p>
<p>In any case, I do have a few minor issues with some of your glyphs.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;S&rsquo; seems a tiny, tiny bit too heavy in its spine nearing the top.</li>
<li>Horizontal strokes in letters like &lsquo;E&rsquo;, &lsquo;L&rsquo; and &lsquo;Z&rsquo; could be a tiny bit more bold. Right now I think it contrasts a bit too much with thin diagonal strokes.</li>
<li>&lsquo;H&rsquo; could be a little bit wider I think.</li>
<li>The bowl of &lsquo;P&rsquo; could be a little bit higher. At least, I like the bowl to take up a little bit more space vertically compared to the &lsquo;R&rsquo; to fill a little bit more of the space below the bowl. I think this gives the text a more even color.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Z&rsquo; could be a tiny bit more narrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 85% slant in the diacritics seems perfect by the way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>fujito, as a LaTeX type user&ndash;not a designer&ndash;and fan of oldstyle typefaces, I&rsquo;m eagerly awaiting the release of the results of this project.</p>
<p>For a while, I used metapost (the adaptation of metafont for creating Postscript figures).  To me, metafont/metapost itself is beautiful.  I&rsquo;m not talking about what is produced by it, or even Knuth&rsquo;s conception of essential components of typefaces (I have no opinion about that debate above) but rather that the programming concepts on which the metafont/metapost system is based&ndash;the concepts involved in writing a program&ndash;themselves have beauty.  Eventually I became frustrated with limitations of metapost&ndash;limitations which were the result of Knuth having written metafont in an era when computers had severe memory and speed limitations compared to recent computers.  Now I use easier methods of constructing diagrams, and am not sorry that I don&rsquo;t have to wrestle with metapost, but I still think of it as a beautiful thing&ndash;something from a past era.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating to me that metafont still has functionality that&rsquo;s of value on its own today, despite the existence of modern font design programs.</p>
<p>Very cool project&ndash;especially the ability to parameterize modernness vs. oldstyle.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There were only a few things in MetaPost that gave me problems, although I remember that there were some quirky aspects of programming it.  (Some of the quirks were elegant; others were simply arbitrary.)  The one real problem that I remember now is that I was trying to make a simple diagram with a fluid curve on top, and roughly rectangular regions below it.   I used a trigonometric function to make the curve, and at some point I wanted MetaPost to do calculations that were too fine-grained for it.  I&rsquo;m not sure whether that was for the details of controlling the curve, or maybe for approximate calculations of areas of regions below it.  Or maybe I had problems with both.  I think that I found I was able to control the curve only to a degree, and if I tried to go further than that, the curve behaved oddly.   I think I also wanted certain 2-D regions to have specific total areas, despite being under different parts of the curve.  I recall using a simple approximation of the kind used to generate integrals in the limit.  Metapost either errored out, or produced weird results&ndash;I don&rsquo;t recall.  My conclusion was that Metapost just didn&rsquo;t have enough bits in its representations of numbers.  They weren&rsquo;t regular floating point numbers; they were something that was hand-coded into MetaFont/MetaPost.  That&rsquo;s what I thought at the time, anyway.  I didn&rsquo;t look at the source for more than a minute or two, if that.  That&rsquo;s what I mean by being limited by the era in which Knuth wrote the Metafont.  He needed to get a certain job done, and he needed to save memory, and he figured out a way to do what he wanted to do with the sort of memory limitations he had by constructing numbers and numerical routines that were very compact.  That&rsquo;s what I think, though I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Easier methods:  I&rsquo;ve used xfig a lot over the years.  I love it.  The interface is odd, and could be more convenient in some ways, but within the fairly broad limits of what it does, it allows a lot of control over diagrams.  There are tools that do the same sort of thing with nicer interfaces, but xfig is free, and I know it.  Other than that, I&rsquo;ve used various things.  Whatever I am aware of about that&rsquo;s available and useful.  I&rsquo;ve used GIMP, ImageMagick, OS X Grapher, Gnuplot&ndash;sometimes with Octave as a front end, and one or two programs whose names I forgot a long time ago.  I might start using Matlab or Mathematica at some point for mathematical graphics.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi oneweioranother,</p>
<p>The key words «top, bot, lft, rt» are associated with drawing with fixed pens. With them you can either only draw a given path
<code>
pickup pencircle xscaled a yscaled b;
draw z1{up} &hellip; z2{right};
</code>
<img src="/images/old-images/draw_5718.png" alt="">
or envelop an outline:
<code>
filldraw z1l{up} &hellip; z2l{right}
&ndash; z2r{left} &hellip; z1r{down} &ndash; cycle;
</code>
<img src="/images/old-images/filldraw_4809.png" alt="">
For these purposes, «top, bot, lft, rt» will help you to set the borders of the drawn line correct. However, most of the time you will probably only need filling commands:
<code>
fill z1l{up} &hellip; z2l{right}
&ndash; z2r{left} &hellip; z1r{down} &ndash; cycle;
</code>
<img src="/images/old-images/fill_6106.png" alt="">
Or penstroke commands (which is just an abbreviated fill command):
<code>
penstroke z1e{up} &hellip; z2e{right};
</code>
<img src="/images/old-images/penstroke_4078.png" alt="">
For these purposes, «top, bot, lft, rt» are useless.</p>
<p>I have written an  [[https://www.tug.org/members/TUGboat/tb33-3/tb105romer.pdf|article in tugboat]] about filling and drawing, which can be viewed online as a TUG-member and will become publicly available around December 13, 2013.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
