body: I think this is just ONE font. I could use some help. The "W" should be the
  determining factor. Thank you very much![img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrontDoor_6074.jpg]

  body: "Thank you Fivos!! \r\nThe capital W in Webster threw me. Also, it's NOT a
    true italic. It's Plantin Regular with a 10 or 12 degree \"shear\" to it (Adobe
    Illustrator). I have Plantin on my computer. Should have just kept trying!!! "
