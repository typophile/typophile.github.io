body: "Is there a straightforward modification that can be made to a TTF file, via
  adding a table, or altering a few entries in some tables,  that would give the font
  generic italic and bold styles.  Or, is there some well-known utility that does
  this.\r\n\r\nHere's some background on this question.\r\n\r\nI'm doing some work
  in Flex and Actionscript 3, (part of the Adobe flash family) and one of the options
  is to embed a font in an application.  You can either embed a font as a 'systemFont'
  or as  'source' (the actual TTF file).  When embedding, you also have the option
  of specifying fontStyle='italic' or fontWeight='Bold.'  My point of confusion is
  that, while I can embed some Windows system font as italic or bold (or a combination),
  if I locate the actual TTF file for that system font, and try to embed that directly
  (i.e. as a  'source' embedding), and also specify italic or bold,  invaribly I get
  an error from the compiler - 'no italic and bold info in the file'.  So, it is evident
  to me that as a system font, Windows is generally coming up with the italic and
  bold transformations on its own, and not from info in the ttf file.  This is even
  more apparent if you call GetFontData (a windows legacy function) which retrieves
  the ttf from memory for an actual loaded font, and whether the font is italic or
  bold or normal, it returns the exact same ttf file from memory, identical to what
  is on disk.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, if Windows can generate its own italic and
  bold transformations on its own, is there a way I could alter a ttf file to have
  generic bold and italic info to begin with.  (For various reasons I need to embed
  directly from the ttf file and not from a Windows system font.)  I know a fair amount
  about the structure of tables in a ttf file after studying some Apple docs for the
  last few days, and have made some other types of successful modification to ttf
  files.  I want some simple generic transformation of a ttf file along the lines
  of whatever windows is doing on its own.  I've been looking at the fvar and gvar
  tables, but none of the fonts on my system use those tables at all (so I don't have
  any examples).  "

  body: "Any font. Italic and bold is all I need for styles.\r\n\r\nFor some well
    known fonts, e.g. Times New Roman, etc, there are seperate ttf files for italic,
    bold, and bold italic.  But for ninety percent of the fonts on my system, there
    is one ttf file for each of them, and windows is generating italic and bold fonts
    on its own, by some generic transformation.  I want to be able to make a straightforward
    modification to such a file to make it italic (For example it would be convenient
    if there were some numeric field among the ttf tables, in which you could specify
    some default slant angle for italic.)  But anyway, the flash compiler is taking
    one look at some ttf file and saying, \"This isn't an italic file\",  and it would
    be a start to know at least how its doing that.  \r\n\r\nThought that maybe some
    of you guys that design a lot of fonts might be experts in the ttf file tables."

    with this), on Mac OS you used to be able to suppress the OS generating fake italics
    and bolds by modifying the base font. There were flags in the FOND resource to
    control this. But that was all: either let the OS do its thing, or disallow it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
