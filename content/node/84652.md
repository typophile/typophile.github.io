body: "Hello, I would like some feedback on the logo concepts and suggestions for
  a more prominent font to be used. The first set uses a roof top concept, the other
  uses a trowel in the \"A\" and the final concept was just put in there to break
  things up. So far the client is hooked on the first concept, which I like as well.
  However, I feel Futura isn't hitting well with it or maybe the balance of the logo
  is a bit off. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any feedback offered on how to better this
  logo using a typeface or modification to the icon. Thanks and I look forward to
  your input. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.zerimargroup.com/ias/ias-build-01.jpg| First Set]]

  body: "Hello David, I think you should continue developing logos 1 and 2 from the
    first set. If you are going to keep the typeface then work on kerning. About the
    symbol, I've seen many similar logos with the same resembling shapes. That said,
    I think you are on the right path, however if you want to go further then start
    working more on the symbol then in the final stages on the typography.  \r\n\r\nSB"

  body: "Concept 1 is very corporate, abstract, and easily interpreted as books, folded
    paper, a rocket, houses very close to each other, and several other things.  Together
    with the colors it feels a bit like a bank identity, fairly reliable and not too
    specific.  \r\n\r\nConcept 2 speaks to hand work.  Traditional craftsmen working
    in a union with time tested materials.  \r\n\r\nConcept 3 feels like handyman
    operation.  Probably able to beat the price point of the others, but not able
    to deliver high end results.  \r\n\r\nDepending on the business, any of them could
    be the perfect fit.  I have no way of knowing what the business is like.\r\n\r\nYou
    should also consider suggesting something other than IAS.  It almost reads as
    a word or two and does nothing to communicate the essence of this business.  What
    does it even stand for?  It certainly is not very memorable, since I had to look
    back as I typed this to make sure I had the right 3 letters."

    seem to be a hallmark of the industry. That means it's not terribly original,
    but that's not always a requirement, either. Something to consider.\r\n\r\nThe
    3rd option seems freshest, though the tools are perhaps superfluous. "

  body: "You really can't evaluate a logo without knowing a lot more about the company.
    \r\n\r\nBut my offhand impression is that number one seems rather generic and
    corporate, but I guess it has possibilities if a corporate look is appropriate
    for your client. I'd make the roof/wall symbols a bit bigger inside the blue rectangle.\r\n\r\nIn
    the second set I like the symbolism, which seems much more specific to the business.
    However I'm not sure that we'll be able to tell they are trowels when the logos
    are reduced to small sizes.\r\n\r\nSet number 3 is specific to the trade, which
    is good, but it looks top-heavy and somewhat disjointed. Maybe if you enlarged
    the symbols and put everything within a border or field it might help unify it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you all for your comments. There is much to consider from reading your
    feedback. I highly appreciate it. I'm not so sure about much of these concepts
    anymore. I'll share in a bit. I've always enjoyed the work of [[http://www.idapostle.com/portfolio/|Steve
    Zelle]] and [[http://imjustcreative.com/logo-design-portfolio/|Graham Smith]]
    for their minimalist approach. There are times more complicated logos are called
    for and in the construction/building industry it seems there's always bold, strong,
    and power built fonts used. I'm still in the process of getting back a positioning
    statement from the client. This is probably the 2nd logo I've ever done.\r\n\r\nBefore

    thanks for your reply. I really appreciate your observation. One of the upsetting
    things I just discovered while looking for a few logo sites by Logomotive, was
    that I found Logo Chief and it has a logo generator. I found this posted on there\r\nhttp://www.logochief.com/logo-color-options.php?id=1076&v=thumb.png&font=georgia.ttf&fontcolor=000000&layout=1&tag=build&category=19&age=&gender=&attribute=\r\n\r\nQuite
    a curve ball for me as I had only heard of Logo Chief but never seen the site.
    Then when I went through it that logo popped up. A bit frustrating for me now.
    \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"You should also consider suggesting something other than
    IAS\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<strong>Luma Vine</strong>, thank you for your thoughts.
    I had suggested to the client that a name change would be better as it is a start-up
    which has had a very generic type to it. However, they are the owners initials
    and in my attempt to encourage naming and re-naming the owner opted for this name.
    It was originally the last name of the owner followed by the word \"construction\".
    \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"The 3rd option seems freshest, though the tools are perhaps
    superfluous.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<strong>aluminum</strong>, this is very true
    and as I stated initially it was just to break away from the initial concept and
    move ahead. However, there's always the possibility that it might work if pitched
    to the client.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"In the second set I like the symbolism, which
    seems much more specific to the business. However I'm not sure that we'll be able
    to tell they are trowels when the logos are reduced to small sizes.\r\n\r\n...Maybe

    The symbol is a bit generic and corporate, as I have just discovered. And you're
    right about the 3rd one being too top heavy. Again, I'm also waiting on the positioning
    statement from the client to narrow down concepts and colors. \r\n\r\nI'm not
    normally a logo designer but I have dabbled a bit with it. The client is fairly
    easy to work with and flexible, except with naming. I'm going to keep pushing
    for more information and narrow down details. Currently the client is super busy
    and I do have a good amount of time for this project, so I'm pushing a few concepts
    around. \r\n\r\nThe business is located in the US in San Diego, California. Many
    construction and building companies do not have standard logos, they are constantly
    changing except for maybe two major companies. The smaller companies, as many
    in this industry, aren't too interested in branding as they are with what they
    do. \r\n\r\nThanks again, I'm still open to more thoughts and feedback. "

    from the client\r\n\r\nI know it's tempting to jump right into developing concepts,
    but it sounds like you're doing things out of sequence. The first step in a logo
    project is to have discussions with your client to discuss their company, their
    goals, the image they currently have and the one they want to project, their competition,
    and so on. This will give you a much better idea of what you need to communicate
    through the logo."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestion. Discussions have taken place, and the client is
    a bit unsettled about what they want exactly. I'm developing some concepts to
    help better the client's understanding. Because I have the time to do it, and
    because I know the client personally, I'm helping them understand what the logo
    should represent. What we have nailed down so far is the color; they want blue
    and they want a corporate horizontal logo; not something vertical. The second
    set of the first link I posted in Set 1 gives us that. I'm looking to build on
    that a bit more as soon as I get the positioning statement. So while it may appear
    that the process is out of sequence, it is more of helping the client understand
    the need for the identity first. \r\n\r\nEducating a client is a plus for me.
    At a time where too often I read articles written by designers who complain about
    what clients want or don't want, it's refreshing to work with someone who not
    only wants to understand their business, but the process behind the scenes to
    enhance their business. \r\n\r\nMy purpose in requesting feedback on the logos
    is simply to help me understand what might work where some details are a bit mirky.
    But I will definitely sit down with the client to discuss this further. Thanks
    again, you have some very valid points. "
