body: "Hi all, \r\nI'm a newbie here, and I hope to generate some discussion and get
  some feedback on my masters project while I'm here :)\r\n\r\nI'm developing a typeface
  based on the counter forms of letter shapes, in order to test the ability of readers
  to recognise these first as alphabetic forms, and secondly their ability to decipher
  and read them. I am not interested in creating a highly readable typeface for common
  use but rather in testing the readers ability to decipher new letter-shapes based
  on a subconscious familiarity with the counter-forms.\r\n\r\nThe typeface is close
  to the testing phase and I want to create an interview or questionnaire in order
  to test these theories. I have ideas about how this questionnaire should be constructed
  but I would really benefit from some specific examples of legibility tests. Although
  there are alot of references to legibility tests out there I'm having trouble finding
  actual examples of these tests.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can provide advice on where to
  find such test examples it would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nKate"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lint_14_6508.gif]\r\nHere is an early
    draft. This one is a degenerative version, where parts of the counters and ascenders
    and descenders have been removed. The letter \"l\" disappears altogether and distinctions
    between \"n\" and \"h\" and \"b\", \"d\", \"p\" and \"q\" are unclear. This is
    something I am working on to fix. Also you can see that it is not strictly a counter
    form typeface as some features such as the dot on \"i\" and \"j\" remains."

    counterforms inside of the letters. The counterforms outside of the letters are
    just as important, and in the case of some letters, even more important than the
    interior. "

    I am aware of this however I have made the decision to work with the inner counters
    only as much as possible. The font is still in development so I hope to deal with
    some of the legibility issues...\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>things that just happened\r\nlike
    lint.</cite>\r\n\r\nIndeed, you are correct! Its from a Richard Brautigan poem
    from which the fonts name was decided.\r\nHeres the whole thing:\r\n\r\n<strong>
    lint </strong>\r\n\r\nI\u2018m haunted a little this evening by feelings that
    have no vocabulary and events that should be explained in dimensions of lint rather
    than words. I\u2018ve been examining half scraps of my childhood. they are pieces
    of distant life that have no form or meaning. they are things that just happened
    like lint.\r\n\r\nBy Richard Brautigan\r\n\r\nI found it quite apt.\r\n\r\n"

    Architects Brand identity. I believe the process was to draw \r\na typeface for
    the foundation, then develop on from there. They also have \r\na fantastic approach
    there work, developing typeface for a majority of projects."
