  my books for class, I decided to look for some design books that I could use for
  inspiration. This book, Fingerprint, intrigued me. The cover is simple: just the
  title, some abstract shapes, and a label explaining the contents of the book. I
  am a big fan of collaging by hand, and figured this book would give me some ideas
  on how to incorporate my handmade stuff with the digital. The layout is simple:
  unobtrusive text located on the edges and large images that allow the projects to
  retain the focus.   "
