  body: "This lettering is a pastiche of styles. Note for example the median spurs
    -- found in many wild west fonts --and the foxtail terminals There are some fonts
    that catch some of the flavor of the lettering. For example, Exocet by Jonathan
    Barnbrook http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=95 and the Dogma movie font, a fan
    effort as  Avqest http://www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest. Also some other fonts
    by Jonathan Barnbrook, including Mason http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=104 and
    Jeremy Dooley's Newcomen\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/newcomen/\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Ryuk, thanks for the link to St Bernardine. If we click on the image of
    the bottle we get an enlarged view that shows more of the label than was in Adam's
    Image. In addition to EVIL SPIRITS It shows a full uppercase alphabet. This is
    simply a set of Tuscan Roman letters. In the context of the label I expect that
    these are Ouija board letters. Digital fonts Captain Howdy http://haroldsfonts.com/portfolio/capn-howdy/\r\nDon"

  body: "Can't agree more with Don. Definitely custom (and by [[http://www.stbernadine.com/clients/evil-spirits-distillery|St
    Bernardine]]).\r\nReminds me also on construction this [[http://typophile.com/node/114413|previous
    discussion]] too: initials /E and /S from one side, /V, /I, /L, /P, /R and /T
    (cross-shaped) from the other.\r\nFor initials and rather using a /3 instead of
    a /E: I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-billhead-1890|Billhead
