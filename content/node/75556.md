body: "I have absolutely no prior knowledge of typography or type-design, but recently
  decided to design a typeface of my own. \r\n\r\nI know it's not exactly the most
  complex of designs but I like to think it's relatively original.\r\n\r\nI'm not
  looking for comments on spacing as this hasn't left illustrator yet, just wondered
  what the type gurus out there thought.\r\n\r\nAny name suggestions would also be
  cool aswell,\r\n\r\nCheers, Elliott"

    My only misgiving is about the Fs: to my eye, they''re both rather bottom-heavy...'

  body: "Nick is right, this is a great first font. But there\u2019s a lot going in
    the design that only works because the strokes are so light\u2014which I\u2019m
    sure is intentional. I think you will learn a lot by designing regular and black
    weights just to see what has to change to make the design adapt to proportions
    of 1:7 and 1:3. Then make then all work together. And if you still want to keep
    designing type at that point, you\u2019re perfect for the job."

    nice... why did you not carry them over to the other l/c and caps?\r\n\r\nI think
    it could add a very distinctive quality to the font."

  body: "@Dunwich - thanks, I actually started this design with a regular/bold wieght
    but then decided to convert it to paths after the completion of the lower case
    characters as I felt it improved work flow and the overall look of the font. I
    also had trouble with the intersects as I felt they were to heavy on most of the
    characters[img:sites/default/files/old-images/next_5651.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n@typeterror
    - I can't honestly say why I didn't carry them through, most probably because
    I rushed the uppercase slightly this morning (lowercase was my focus). I think
    I shall rectify this later as it would look better with consistent bowls\r\n\r\n@nick
    - it definately sits better, I just had a dying need to try and keep the descender
    of the f to a minimum; amateur i guess\r\n\r\nElliott"

    I take it you are very familiar with the bezier tool!

  body: "@typerror - somewhat of a type error on my part there!\r\n\r\nwith regards
    the e, that looks excellent; I'll definately be translating that into the typeface
    later today. It's much more distinctive than the initial shape and i'll definately
    follow this through with the uppercase characters, thankyou\r\n\r\n@brianskywalker
    - correct, the pen tool is about all I've used for this typeface so far. That
    and the new line width tool in Illustrator CS5, makes editing paths so much more
    versatile without having to flatten them"

  body: "Looking good! Though I think the /a/ still looks a bit geometric and wide.
    Your arched letters /n/m/h/u/ might need to be changed to look more similar to
    your rounded ones. There is  a hard edge on the right of some of them as well.\r\n\r\nYour
    curly brace should be monoline. The numerals also have a very different art deco
    feel from the rest of the font, and are too geometric."
