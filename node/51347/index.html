  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm rebranding myself really soon, and my company name will potentially be called 'Flo' (variation of Flow).

I already got some great feedback, but I was looking for some professional design comments.

---------

My main questions are:

1- Is this legible? Does it really need to be once the potential client already knows my company name?
2- Since the word is so short (how I like it) and with the font, can it potentially be mistaken for Arabic writing or a symbol?
3- I think the beauty is in the simplicity, I guess it would just be a matter of how I'd apply it.

I'm loving it at the moment, but of course, I'm trying not to until I get good feedback and reassurance from a new set of eyes! :)

(forgive the size, I'm using FLONT on Veer)

Thanks in advance!

The only time someone might not be able to read it, is if they see Uo instead, but if they know what a cursive f looks like, then it shouldn't be an issue.</div>

Simplicity is always potentially good, and it isn't hard to understand why it appeals to you so much. You're doing more than hedging for a simple logo / identity; you're trying to make a virtue out of applied simplicity.

Ryte. Got it. This is good.

My gut reaction is that what you've turned out is a little too simple for some people and may pass over their heads without registering any kind of effect or reaction. I like it, and I love the cyan and white color scheme (very contemporary colors), but if I were doing it I would try another hue with hyer impact value. Like magenta, for example. Or orange (not burnt orange but a yellow-orange), or maybe even indigo. The cyan color is a bit passive and kind-of not really biting my cerebellum hard enuff to make me want to know more about what's behind the logo.

Also try: using a capital <strong>F</strong> (if available) for two reasons. 1) To increase the readability / legibility; 2) To make the logo graphically stronger. With a capital <strong>F</strong> you'd have less reason to change the color and maybe retain the cyan after all.

Ideally you could try designing a capital <strong>F</strong> from the lower case one you're already trialing. That way you'd retain the lovely loop tail and still have a capital <strong>F</strong>.

1- I agree with the colors - I was thinking an orange as well. I was thinking of retaining my current colors which were cyan. I am going to explore the colors much more until I find something I'm happy with.

2- The capital for this typeface changes the look dramatically. I would probably explore, like you said, adding some elements to make this a nice capital. Do you think it would just be a matter of adding 2 horizontal strokes on the ascender?

Also I wanted to know about the FLO thing. Do people think of a woman's name as welll?</div>

Of course, I would change the ligature between the 'i' and the 'x', this is just for viewing purposes.

I agree, it looks really nice in orange.

If I were to see it in context of say, a surboard, I would obviously instantly think of 'flow' the word, and not a middle aged woman.  So it all depends on context as well!

		<div class="commentbody">Definitely stick with flo. I love this mark - it's <em>extremely</em> legible, and generally lovely to look at. The white on cyan looks really good, but you could really put it on just about any coloured (or textured) background and it would still look just as good. On the other hand, I really think <em>flix</em> loses a lot of the charm - the name isn't as strong, and the mark loses the wonderfully concise, compact feeling of the original. Stick with <em>flo</em>!

Great work!

		<div class="commentbody">about your name, let it be taken literally.  I om obviously not experienced in this so my insight is just an average joe, please treat it that way and just consider it for what it is.

Do you communicate Flo's?  Do you design Flo's?  A sign maker makes signs.  A flo designer designs what?

I think Flo by itself, if it were properly thought out and designed has the potential to stand on it's own, but what are you?

Are you a self-branded designer, are you a studio with more than one designer?  Graphic Design? Type design? Web Design?

I unfortunately don't have the pleasure of knowing you yet, so it's not apparent to me what it is you do, but if you are going to support the word 'Flo' with another word instead of an <em>activity phrase</em>, please make it something so straightforward and simple even I would understand it.

I'll use a generic word of a company that may or may not exist, and you tell me which reveals more about who they are (just from the name or phrase)

Apex Gear.     or     Apex. Mountain climbing equipment.

Intuishun Communications.    or   Intuishun. web development.


I think the latter are FAR more descriptive, and the 'tagline' should be a simple concise description of what it is you do, but don't try to work it into your logo, your mark is very stable and self-contained.

I just ask that you think about it and consider the alternatives and see which works best, that's all.

This has a lot of potential, I'd love to see where it keeps going!</div>

Thought #1: *designflo* to me sounds more interesting than *flodesign*
It also gives me more flow connotation, than flo the waitress.

Thought #2: A tag line should do more than explain what your company does, it should give your company a voice. "Flo - Graphics, web & printing" is like saying: "MacDonalds - Burgers, Fries & Coke." I am helping a client with this notion right now, so it was on my mind. Give yourself personality.

Thought #3: Design or Graphic Design sounds like a profession. Graphics or Graphic Artist, sound like you work at a strip mall sign shop. Without "design" you are little more than a color jocky.

Thought #4: Careful with the cyan + brushscript + round font = this exact moment in design time. The best part of this is the logo.

		<div class="commentbody">Although "flo" (especially in the modern script font) does remind me a little of a middle-aged waitress, I still like it.  It gives you personality.  For adding further clarity, I like the suggestion of "designflo"--very slick sounding.  Otherwise, I would suggest "DESIGN" in a light, all-caps, sans-serif font placed beneath "flo."  As for color, I happen to like the blue, but I would suggest something closer to cerulean for a little punch (and maybe a subtle gradient).

Looking good, though.  Best of luck.</div>

although i did think flow as in that special time of the month... but i wouldn't worry about it. Your whole brand image including how you use the logo will determine your identity and the way people are influenced by your name.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1- Is this legible? Does it really need to be once the potential client already knows my company name?

Yes, I caught onto it right away.

2- Since the word is so short (how I like it) and with the font, can it potentially be mistaken for Arabic writing or a symbol?

I don't think so. It is a easy read IMO.

3- I think the beauty is in the simplicity, I guess it would just be a matter of how I’d apply it.

100%



I am quite fond of the 'flo' logo - Great Job.
You were right to go with Cyan - Orange would remind me too much of Veer's mark.

I think you could play around with your bcard however.
The text "Flow Design & Communication - Graphics, Web & Printing." extends from the first column to the second. Maybe give them more space or move them completely? I'm not sure. 

Good Luck!
