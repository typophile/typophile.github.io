  wellness. also, mentioned was that it be clear, clean and recognizable. your thoughts/suggestions
  are always appreciated.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/np_3568.jpg]

  body: The mark from the top one, but not the type. I would probably drop the last
    concept as it is too Unilever-ish.

  body: "Good luck. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. I hope you're not dealing with an too-often-seen
    so called <em>small client</em> that thinks they can be smarter than you... The
    ones I used to ask (when they became too smart on me) whether they provide detailed
    working guidance to their dentist as well?\r\n\r\nMany think they can mess with
    designers because they think they don't have time themselves to deal with it so
    they hired someone and expect low price for it because they could do it (probably
    better) themselves."

  body: this project has gone faster then i'd like. wish i had more time to post/feedback.
    anyway, here is where it's going. client went from wanting something detailed/ornate
    to simple, bold and clean. wants a "plate shape" type logo. showcase a vegetable/fruit
    of some kind. thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/npn_5844.jpg]

  body: "Depending on the client I show them few concepts but always make a strong
    preference of one that I think is the one to pursue. Sometimes I just show them
    one (when I know it's a killer logo and wouldn't want any other to be chosen).\r\n\r\nOf
    the last five you've shown you can easily discard the first one (pear) because
    many companies have used this kind of concept (remember AT&T).\r\n\r\nI would
    choose #2 but it desperately needs a different font. The one you've used looks
    like some freely available not so well designed font (characters have different
    weight and even more importantly style). You will also have to do something about
    the leaf at the top. Forget of colours (and shades) for a while and create a symbol
    that works. Leaf will probably have to be bigger to make it work. And use some
    geometric font with it (nothing wrong with avantgarde actually). The good thing
    about the second logo is also that is uses an apple that's a more universal symbol
    of fruit than the ones you've used in other symbols. The main problem with this
    second logo is that this symbol may have been used many times with many different
    industries.\r\n\r\nThe fourth one is quite nice as well, but I'm not completely
    sure whether it goes along with client brief.\r\n\r\nThe last one is the one I
    can't decide about. I can't say whether I like it or not. It's well executed and
    balanced but I can't see it as a logo. It's more of a certificate mark that goes
    on certified products for instance."

  body: The marks themselves are nice, but I don't like the type at all. Try a typeface
    that relates more to the image, and the feel you want to convey.

  body: "Yes the emblems are much too different/separated from the type itself. Try
    to encorporate them, either via feel, or distance between them, or both. Try making
    an emblem with the words NEW PLATE and add NUTRITION at hte bottom. Its a marketing
    tip, you want people to remember new plate before what it is. \r\n\r\nAlso try
    taking things literally - work off of a plate."

  body: "thanks everyone. wish i would of seen this earlier. =(  i ended up showing
    the top three. client choose the pear concept with some modifications. No fruit
    focus instead a vegetable. in this case a carrot. my fav was/is #2. i should of
    pushed for that. although, i might of missed my mark since the client changed
    their mind to go with a vegetable instead. frustrating. \r\n\r\n@litera - I thought
    about the ATT feel, but thought i might be okay since i was encasing the mark
    and making a fruit shape. anyway, now i've gotta work with it. crap! =|\r\n\r\n@trevor
    - i thought i had. any specific comments on the type selection for the pear idea?\r\n\r\n@defragmybrain
    - thanks. i ran the name option by the client in the initial stages, but client
    felt that was a mandatory thing. I might revisit it though. \r\n\r\nlesson learned.

  body: oooookay! yet another change. this is where i'm at. any feedback would be
    great. i'm leaning towards the top version. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/npn_3_4913.jpg]

  body: I would go with the size of 1 with the alignment of 2.  Maybe consider a bit
    bolder version of nutrition at the small size (or cheat like I do occasionally
    and just add a tiny bit of stroke), and try a tracked out, (sm)all caps version
    of the subtitle.
