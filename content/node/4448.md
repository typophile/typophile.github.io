  body: Thanks kris! <BR>FYI, there&#39;s an illustration missing - it should be added
    by the end of the day. <BR> <BR>&#40;You see, I had to post <i>something</i> quickly,
    otherwise John&#39;s parenthetical prediction in his opening sentence would have
    been wrong. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    a nice way of saying that Hrant has a big hole in his head?.....   ;?&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Is that a recent photo of you Hrant that you use when posting? <BR> <BR>gln

  body: That photo is very old - I was half the age. But after an eleven-year absence
    I do have that goatee back again, so the photo actually looks more like me now
    than it did for a long while! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    but it didn&#39;t take more than a few first hours on these pages to know that
    you&#39;re one of the greats. <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the insights!

    a news face, but I&#39;ve always seen Quadraat as a bloodhound. Times is a bit
    self-conscious, so maybe an Ibizan &#40;although it&#39;s very hard picturing

    with Rummy. Too bad. <BR> <BR>I did like the interview too - especially Hrant&#39;s
    thoughts about <BR>alternative methods for stress and emphasis which I&#39;ve
    heard <BR>him talk about here and there, but not as succinctly.

    like the English word of that spelling &#40;soft &#34;r&#34;, &#34;uh&#34; not
    &#34;oo&#34;&#41;. In Eastern Armenian the ending is a &#34;d&#34;. In French
    it sounds like a pig being run over. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    well said.  <BR> <BR>I wasn&#39;t finished. I believe <i>faith</i> is the willingness
    to risk, but having <i>hope</i> enough that it will be a step forward. Which in
    essence is setting <i>goals</i> and working toward those goals. Without hope there
    can be no faith. Kudos to you, Hrant, for your willingness to share that with
    everyone.
