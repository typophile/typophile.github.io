  showing the credits.

  body: 'Look inside your computer... It&#39;s the type they use on the boards like
    video-cards and such. The S is a giveaway. It&#39;s a lot like the type generated
    by the &#39;titling machines&#39; you could fasten onto your drawing board in
    the &#39;old days&#39;, eg build up out of straightish segments. <BR>I went to
    see the movie today ; &#41; and the credits sequence animation is like circuitry
    builing up et cetera. <BR>For the font itself: I guess a circuitry drawing program
    would probably include &#40;a&#41; similar font&#40;s&#41; or you could try specific
    sites.'

  body: Bank Gothic was used on posters. But it is not similar to the end-credtis
    font. You have to see the movie to know, what I mean.

  body: 'Ilja, that&#39;s what Bert was explaining: it&#39;s the type used on the
    boards  <BR>like video cards and such. Bert, was it something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=ocr"
    target="_blank"> this</a>?'

  body: OCR-B comes close, but not quite, though it has the characteristic straight
    ends in contrast to the other OCR&#39;s that are even more monoline and have round
    ends. <BR>I did a search for Printed Circuit Board &#40;PCB&#41; software, but
    the two available programs available for OS X did not include fonts like the one
    I mean... &#40;one used Chicago, the other a sticktype of premade artwork&#41;.
