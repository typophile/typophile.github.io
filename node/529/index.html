		<div class="commentbody">Ok, thanks for the criticism. The K seems odd because it's mirrored, it was a last minute design decision (which indeed might be changed) because I wanted to have the cyrillic influence more apparent. It's not in the original typeface though, so it might seem odd.  <BR> <BR>As for the @, I wanted to have a connection to the flag, I thought of the @ symbol as the the &quot;party symbol&quot;&hellip; Like a swastika or the hammer &amp; the I don't know what the other is called&hellip; cutter? (erm&hellip;)I can agree that it's a bit over the top though, I might remove it. <BR> <BR>This was in fact semi traced from a photograph,  <BR>even though I didn't use streamline&hellip; (can't trust that damn program&hellip;) And I was after this look: <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1256.jpg" ALT="soviet"> <BR> <BR>There's slightly more shading to it, something that the above miss, but still, I think it's fairly decent.  <BR> <BR>One thing I see in the original portrait is that it's a bit more &quot;angular&quot; or choppy if you like. As for the use of a b&amp;w photo with high grain, yes, that would be nice, but it would kill my computer.  <BR> <BR>This is going to be printed at a huge size, about 2,5 - 3 meters wide (and then there's the typeface below&hellip;), so anything but native illustrator curves are out of the game. <BR> <BR>Also, the type will be applied (where there's alot of white space) if it doesn't look cluttered, with mock up revolutionary political messages. Sort of like the soviet poster. <BR> <BR>One thing I've noticed in most russian propaganda is the strong diagonals and 45 degree rotated text&hellip; I'll try that. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Thanx again.</div>

I wanted a political design that was strong and controversial, and the swastika flag design suited it really well. I'm definitly not a nazist, so that's not the reason. I have always thought of this typeface as a &quot;dictatorship styled&quot; one, pick anyone you &quot;like&quot;, cuba, russia, germany - they all have great graphic design (especially communist russia and nazi germany) <BR>and that's what I'm mimicking.  <BR> <BR>As for Kevin's suggestion, I'm (as previously stated) staying away from bitmapped stuff. It would be unworkable on my computer. (If I had a choice I would make it in Illustrator and run it over in Painter with some clonebrushes, it does wonders)</div>

As German society became more <BR>cosmopolitan, the national style of writing was <BR>viewed as antiquated and ugly. Consequently, the <BR>humanist Antiqua, both in its printed and written <BR>form became more and more fashionable. This, of <BR>course, changed with the rise of the Third Reich. <BR>Antiqua and Latin script were declared <BR>&quot;Un-German&quot; and &quot;non-Aryan&quot;. Only the Fraktur and <BR>Gothic typefaces were to be considered &quot;German&quot;. <BR>The result of this policy was that during the <BR>following eight years many perverted forms of <BR>Gothic and Fraktur were designed, some of them <BR>contemptuously known as &quot;Schaftstiefel Grotesk&quot;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I attended that discussion in Leipzig, and will repeat my comments here, because I feel it is very important. <BR> <BR>It is wrong to let some pathological subculture or political movement appropriate a style of lettering that developed over centuries. The fact that Christian Death or Storm Front choose to enlist someone else's hard work (e,g. a type design) in the service of their own cause or beliefs should not soil the type itself, especially when the original designer died over a century ago!! Yvonne Schwemer-Scheddin's analysis as it appeared in the Bain/Shaw monograph, while a good compendium of illustrations, is in my opinion way off. Those designs should be celebrated and judged on their aesthetic and technical merit and not on what some 25-year-old bigot in an Oi band still living with his parents does with them. The increasingly neurotic impulse to suppress &quot;dangerous ideas&quot; so common in Germany today serves only to give those ideas more power. <BR> <BR>People speak of a &quot;Nazi aesthetic.&quot; THERE IS NO NAZI AESTHETIC. They plundered the aesthetic of the times just the same as they plundered Jewish property. To insist any differently is to give them credit they never deserved. <BR> <BR>There are, however, a number of &quot;Constructivist&quot;-looking textura-grotesk hybrids that were inspired heavily by the aesthetics of the early Nazi and pre-Nazi era, mainly Tannenberg and Element, and whose advertisements leveraged the prevailing Nazi sentiment of the times, appropriately labeled &quot;Schaftstiefelgrotesk.&quot; They are used today mainly for satirical purposes when someone wants to paint someone else as a Nazi (enter Godwin's Law.) And yet, all the anti-Nazi paranoia in Europe isn't enough to stop the EU giving money to The Amazing Exploding Palestinians in their effort to once again &quot;protect&quot; the world from <I>der ewige Jude</I>. Full circle in just sixty years. <BR> <BR>You can get the black weight of Tannenberg from Dieter Steffmann's site <a href="http://www.steffmann.de">www.steffmann.de</a> for free, and you can buy the lighter and bold weights from <a href="http://www.fraktur.com">www.fraktur.com</a>, Delbanco Frakturschriften. Again, I presume any use would be for sharply critical/satirical purposes. <BR> <BR>The best selection of blackletters available in one place is Dipl.-Ing. Gerhard Helzel's site <a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de">www.romana-hamburg.de</a>. In addition to his impressively cerebral list of hobbies (Latin, oil painting, electrical engineering, and writing erotic novellas) he offers over 300 digitized blackletters for sale, many unavailable elsewhere, with lots of ligatures and alternates including the important but oft-forgotten half-r. He puts a ch ligature in the c slot, so have your FontLab handy if you choose to buy. <BR> <BR>Another source is FVL GbR, <a href="http://www.fraktur.de">www.fraktur.de</a>, from whom I recently bought the narrow alternates from Koch's Wilhelm Klingspor-Schrift and a few others. The exact relationships between these companies and the large foundries like Linotype and Berthold are not always clear, but from conversations that I've had with the one larger foundry, they're not that interested in reviving more old blackletters, because they simply don't sell enough to justify the investment required to digitize them, so these companies are generally not a concern to them, and in some cases they have reached an understanding. I hope to get a better handle on just who is and who isn't considered a pirate in these four cases, since there are some overlaps with commercial fonts on the glyph level if not on the font level. <BR> <BR>On my own site, I have a growing directory of commercial blackletter designs offered by several foundries, large and small. Visit <BR> <BR><a href="http://eccentrifuge.com/Fonts/blackletter.html">http://eccentrifuge.com/Fonts/blackletter.html</a> <BR> <BR>The page will get a formatting upgrade in the next month or so. Anyone here with a commercial blackletter design who wants to be listed can mail me at <a href="mailto:john@eccentrifuge.com">john@eccentrifuge.com</a>. The point of the site is to introduce font consumers to the lesser-known blackletter designs out there. Opinions are appreciated. <BR> <BR>Finally, in regard to your design, my impression is that you disapprove of (pardon my ignorance) whatever group it is that you're depicting. If that's your intent, than the execution is flawless.</div>
