		<div class="commentbody">Jumping in as a relative newcomer: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An important factor might be where in the spectrum from classical proportions to monospaced proportions a typeface lies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A classical font like Trajan is built on the forms of the circle, the square, and the triangle.

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, there seem to be two models of UC width: the Classical with its great divergence*, and what might be called the Modern with its convergence. But I'm not sure how much there is in between. You do see some faces with a letter or two deviating from the Classical (like the wide &quot;S&quot; of Will Carter and sometimes Zapf, and a wide &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; here and there), but I can't think of any that deviate much from the Modern - I guess that would look totally lousy. What I'm saying is that your caps have to either diverge a lot or not at all**. Makes sense? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Although I'm not sure how strong the geometric basis is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->** The only exception I can think of is Nick Shinn's fascinating Richler. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So Jos</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Back to the original issue: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; There seems to be an (inate?) optimal width for each glyph. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that the optimal width for a given character is a value that can be deviated from safely, upto a point.

However, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->set<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of deviations might have to be consistent, otherwise the harmony is too deep, and it will be seen as discord by practically everybody. What I mean is you can't make half the UC Classical and the other Modern. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for what the &quot;ideal&quot; is, I would say it depends on the structure of the glyph. One obvious example is the &quot;B&quot; versus the &quot;D&quot;: the former is narrower because you can't make half-size bowls look nice that wide. But it's not so simple because a &quot;B&quot; with bowls of [roughly] equal height can't be as wide as one with a large lower bowl. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So there might be a way to quantify the optimal widths of characters by first quantifying their structure, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but<!-- raw HTML omitted --> taste is subjective, so you could only do that for a given person (and really only at a given instant). So what you could do is make a set of caps where the widths please you personally, then make variations of certain characters (like make a &quot;B&quot; with a lower/higher middle) and see how that affects your ideal width, and formulate some numbers for future use. So the next time you make a font, you can draw a single character and &quot;propagate&quot; the ideal widths of all the others, based on their other structural determinants. Once you have the set of ideal widths, you would work inwards. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To avoid making the solution too personal, you could do this to a &quot;classic&quot; face. For example, you could take the Trajan &quot;B&quot;, lower the middle, see how its ideal width changes, and use that dataset as the guide for a new font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is exactly the sort of thread I think type design needs most now. So I hope many people brainstorm about it and delve deeply towards its warm core. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I found something. An article in the 1968 Penrose Annual (which I actually mentioned in the &quot;Trapping&quot; thread) by Louis Rosenblum, where he's devised a system to standardize the measure of the relative widths of text fonts. The apparent aim being to be able to predict layout and/or save on storage (remember: 1968). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rosenblum's style is very terse (he's an engineer by training), so I'm not exactly sure, but it looks like he's taken measurements of many &quot;classic&quot; fonts and arrived at average relative widths: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lowercase: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 5: i <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 6: f j l <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 7: r s t <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 8: z e c <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 9: q g x a o <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10: n h u d p b k y v <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13: w <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15: m <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uppercase: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 8: I <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 9: J <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10: S <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11: Z <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12: P L F <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13: Q O A V B T E C <!-- raw HTML omitted -->14: G U Y R <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15: N H X D K <!-- raw HTML omitted -->18: M W <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Numerals: 9 units. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One strange thing is that for a given width the letters listed aren't alphabetical. But there must be a reason behind their orders. My guess is that they're listed in increasing statistical divergence from the given width. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rosenblum also ties the TTS width system into the discussion, but I couldn't follow that well enough. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One last thing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In pointing out that metal fonts have smaller sizes that are proportionally wider and darker than the larger ones (optical scaling), he says that's due to practical manufacturing concerns!
