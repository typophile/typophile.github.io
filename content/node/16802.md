body: "Just wondering if anyone else here has any kind of typographic tattoos here.
  My first tattoo just finished healing, it's an ambigram of my last name 'bailey'
  made to look like it's embossed into my back (kind of hard to see in this photo).
  Mind you I did this shot on a self timer so I was trying to point to it and get
  in position at the same time...I had been thinking about getting a tattoo for a
  long time but decided that I would only get one if I designed it and if it meant
  something to me. \r\n\r\nThis design became significant to me because of a) I designed
  it myself b) John Langdon told me it was one of the best ambigrams he's seen out
  of any he's ever been sent. To be complimented to this degree by the creator/inventor
  of such art form it humbled me to a great extent c) most importantly it's to commemorate
  my grandfather and father who do amazing carpentry wood work, when they finish a
  piece they brand their names into their work (initials and date usually). When I
  showed this to my grandfather (the ambigram) he was ecstatic and so what I did was
  get him a self inking stamp of it for his birthday. He has since marked all of his
  cherished books and such with the stamp and it was the happiest I've ever seen him
  in the 20 years I've been alive. I'd like to remember that moment. I've essentially
  branded myself with one of my most cherished designs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/myback.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat's
  yours and your story?"

  body: "David, that's really cool. And the shapes are pretty simple, that seems rare
    in ambigrams. Congratulations.\r\n\r\nI know a guy who has a big \"calligraphic\"
    tatoo troughout his chest, from shoulder to shoulder. It looked nice and he was
    so proud of it that I couldn't bring myself to tell him that the French in it
    was wrong :/\r\n\r\n"

  body: Wow, yeah I was talking to the artist while I got mine and he told me a story
    of spelling something wrong on a Hell's Angel biker once...but he had drawn up
    the tat for him and said 'Is this ok?' and the guy ok'ed the design but then later
    realized it was wrong. It was even the city he was from (the biker) oi...needless
    to say the tat artist was scared for his life, but the Hell's Angel realized that
    it was his fault and my artist got out alive haha. He's actually the guy giving
    the tattoo in the beginning of the show Oz on HBO if you've ever seen that. My
    friend grew up with him so I've been hanging out in his shop since I've been in
    Manhattan.
