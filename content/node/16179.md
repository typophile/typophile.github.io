body: "Ok, this should be easy:\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get fonts to work with the \"save
  as PDF\" in FileMaker 8. \r\n\r\nAll the Type One's and Opentype fonts I've tried
  drop extended characters when a PDF is made with FileMaker's PDF generator,  although
  the same page printed to the Acrobat 7 printer works. (This in spite of the fact
  that FileMaker licensed the Acrobat engine from Adobe.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I find that
  Truetype fonts work, so I think, weird, but, okay, I'll regenerate my Adobe Caslon
  as a Truetype for use in Filemaker.\r\n\r\nBUT I can't get the encoding to work:
  \xE9 becomes \xC9, that kind of thing. If I generate an OpenType or Type 1 with
  what I think are the same encodings, the accents work, but the PDF doesn't.\r\n\r\nI
  know I'm missing something simple: I never make Truetype, because I figure OT is
  the way to go, but not this time.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, I've got the encoding sorted. I'm not quite sure what was going on,
    but I think it was a combination of operator error and cache files.\r\n\r\nI still
    don't know why FileMaker won't produce proper PDFs with OpenType or Type 1."

  body: My recommendation is not to use Filemaker for ANYTHING. The program appears
    to have its own ideas about character encoding which cause havoc anytime it interacts
    with another program.

  body: It is true that I've had more trouble font problems with FileMaker than with
    any other program. I should probably look at using data merge in InDesign whenever
    I can.
