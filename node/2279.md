  body: doing it by hand isnt an option for me because im using a great deal of text.
    the result will be sloppy and illegible.

  body: If you&#39;re doing a &#34;great deal&#34; of text, you shouldn&#39;t be using
    a typeface like that anyway.  That should be confined to headlines and titling.

  body: '1&#41; According to a Typophile post by John Butler &#40;a blackletter specialist&#41;,
    it&#39;s called &#34;Schaftstiefelgrotesk&#34; in German. <BR> <BR>2&#41; The
    Bain book lists four fonts: Deutschland, National, Tannenberg and Gotenburg. But
    I&#39;m not sure if any of them are available digitally. <BR> <BR>And two things
    from MyFonts: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/newfonts/christmas/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/newfonts/christmas/</a>
    <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/honda/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/honda/</a>
    <BR>I suggest you buy one of them. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
