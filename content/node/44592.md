  there. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"htpp://www.outrasfontes.com/gaia.htm\">Gaia</a> is the
  first dingbat series made by Ricardo Esteves Gomes, \r\nfrom <a href=\"htpp://www.outrasfontes.com\">Outras
  Fontes</a>.\r\n\r\nEach glyph in this font was designed to be used as single forms
  or as graphic pattens. When repeated several times, they create some interesting
  optical effects. Their organic shapes gives a nice feeling of nature that I hope
  it can be useful for your artworks.\r\n\r\n:)"
