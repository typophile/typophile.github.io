  Posters so I guess its an older typeface maybe around beginning of the 20th century.\r\nThanks
  in advance for helping me out.\r\n\r\nIt looks similar to mostra nuova but Q and
  S are different!\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster_4618.png]"

  body: Thanks for the reply but I don't think that its eagle black! The S is rather
    different and the overall character design of the font shown above seems to be
    more eccentric!

  body: "Hi No\xEBl,\r\nit certainly is not Eagle Black. This is very likely lettered,
    i.e. not a font. Compare the two \u2018E\u2019 in the top and bottom spread: not
    the same. The \u2018L\u2019, \u2018T\u2019, \u2018S\u2019 \u2013 how would they
    go together in one typeface?. This is inspired by 1930s constructivist/futurist
    lettering. A digitally available typeface that shares some characteristics is,
    in addition to the aforementioned Mostra Nueva, Eagle \u2013 see its \u2018C\u2019
    and \u2018N\u2019 in particular.\r\nF"

  body: "Yep you're right! Mostra Nueva looks quit similar but its not the same. Especialy
    the Shape of Q and S are different. Anyway I realy adore the way the E has a very
    slim middle bar and the Q is shaped extremly geometric.\r\nFurther hints are welcome."

  body: "Whose booklet is this? Perhaps it is a custom font, which they modified for
    that E in order to touch the edge of the page. The pictures look like scans from
    a booklet, but it is the sort of display you could also imagine on a web page.
    The lower left titles use the red letters from the Deco-style font, mixed with
    a serif that looks like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-motter-corpus/|Motter
    Corpus]].\r\n\r\nMaybe an e-mail to the owners will get your answer.\r\n\r\n-
