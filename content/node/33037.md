  for my magazine: the idea is to give a picture of the evolution of graphic design
  since early days of desk top publishing.\r\n\r\nType is of course a vital part of
  this. The digital font scene in 1987 was small, the number of fonts in a normal
  computer was microscopical, at least compared to today.\r\n\r\nMy main interests
  are the development of type technology, and the trends. On the tech side, Open Type
  has been the latest big leap; among the trendiest fonts during the last two decades
  are (maybe) Template Gothic and Interstate.\r\n\r\nTips, ideas and thoughts on these
  subjects are very welcome and helpful! "

  body: Can you get hold of a copy of <em>An A-Z of Type Designers</em> edited by
    Neil Macmillan? The essay I wrote for this book covers the technical developments
    in font formats during this period (though mainly focusing on the post 1995 period).

    leap; high-quality anti-aliasing has made digital type far more legible than it
    used to be. IMHO that\u2019s much more important than OpenType, which has really
    just made typesetting easier.\r\n\r\nAnd if you\u2019re going to cover the trendiest
    fonts of the last two decades, don\u2019t forget Meta!"

  body: "Hi Per. I thought you were someone else! Are you aware of Dean Allen's site
    at www.textism.com?\r\n\r\nJames is right, the ClearType rendering is a more recent
    development than OT. There is a very good article on that 20 years of type theme
    at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-digital-past-when-typefaces-were-experimental\r\n\r\n(please
    remember to reference sources correctly in your article)\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    \u2013 thanks!\r\n\r\nJpad: obviously, I need to brush off the dust from my eyes
    :-) And thanks for mentioning Meta, which of course has its place among the trendiest!\r\n\r\nBen:
    No, Dean Allen is news to me, I believe. But never underestimate the subconscious
    mind ... \r\nThanks for the Aiga article, it will come handy. And of course I'll
    remember to credit my sorces!"
