body: "EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Select \u201CAll\u201D; copy, paste and SAVE AS FAR OFFLINE
  AS POSSIBLE. Why? Because I say so? Maybe, but the reason WILL BECOME VERY OBVIOUS
  SOON ENOUGH.\r\n\r\nSo, a funny thing happened to me on the third of July. I made
  out checks to the power company, and for my rent. Unfortunately\u2014silly me\u2014I
  switched them, and the WRONG PARTIES got the RIGHT CHECKS. Which should NOT have
  been a problem if AN ACTUAL HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY READ \u201CPay to the Order of\u201D\u2014which
  OUGHT TO BE A NO-BRAINER, BUT\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks to the wonders of ACH, the funds
  were transferred DESPITE THE FACT that the payees were wrong. My money, in the wrong
  hands, and it's all the FAULT of automation.\r\n\r\nAm I screwed? Well, maybe. On
  the other hand, EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION USING ACH is also\u2014potentially\u2014totally
  screwed with no way out.\r\n\r\nWhy? Simple. Go immediately to your checkbook and
  write out EVERY CHECK you owen TO ANYONE who YOU KNOW uses ACH, and EVERYONE down
  the line who processes that check WITHOUT READING WHO IT IS SUPPOSE TO GO TO\u2026is
  totally screwed. Big time. No way out. Not even in Federal Courts. But\u2014here
  is what is even sweeter\u2014especially in Federal Court.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, CIVIL
  courts proceed on a scientific basis. You present a claim which you say is true
  (plaintiff), and it is up to the guy you are suing (defendant) to prove what you
  say isn't true. Simple? Too simple\u2026because\u2026\r\n\r\nMke your checks out
  to THE GUY you are suing\u2014not by name, of course\u2014simply write your checks
  out to THE GUY.\r\n\r\nThen, by hook or by crook\u2014or at a mom-and-pop ts-hrit
  shop\u2014by any means produce a t-shirt which reads\u2026\r\n\r\nI'M THE GUY.\r\n\r\nIF
  you have been paying attention, you KNOW how this plays out. EVERY CHECK you write
  that you KNOW GOES through ACH is made out to\u2026\r\n\r\nWho's that?\r\n\r\nMe,
  because\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, how you you prove that YOU'RE the guy?\r\n\r\nWell, how
  can you prove I'M NOT THE GUY?\r\n\r\nAnd, brother, if somone can sucker the IRS
  into doing this ONCE\u2026\r\n\r\nBy now, it should be readily apparent why this
  whole message began with a warning\u2026wchich you had better heed RIGHT NOW\u2026\r\n\r\nBecause,
  this particulat post is going to disappear soon\u2026or as soon as ANYONE WHO IS
  TOTALLY SCREWED gets the faintest whiff of it.\r\n\r\nNo prob: it's going viral,
  and YOU ARE THE VIRUS? Why\u2026\r\n\r\nThe only way to shut this up is TO SHUT
  DOWN THE WHOLE INTERNET. Which couldn't POSSIBLY happen. But it might, so you can
  go vial old-style: let another actual human being in on the joke, face-to-face.
  Live human viruses. Crazy, right?\r\n\r\nAnd, ladies: just for laughs, do the VERY
  SAME THING. Because, if you say that I'M THE GUY in Federal Court, YOU DO NOT HAVE
  TO PROVE SOMETHING which is patently false; the OTHER GUYS have to prove that it
  IS PATENTLY FALSE. Which they simply cannot do. Why? Because, everywhere they turn,
  they cannot disprove that\u2026\r\n\r\nOccupy Wall Street, hell: as soon as the
  first check goes through, WE ALL OWN WALL STREET, and\u2026\r\n\r\nTurnabout is
  fair play. So, big shots: bend over and spread 'em\u2026\r\n\r\nHey? Whose idea
  was this, anyhow?\r\n\r\nThat would be me. Why?\r\n\r\nWell, because\u2014technically\u2014I
  am THE guy. But I can't prove it. But I can. Technically. But nobody can disprove
  it. Because all these guys got t-shirts saying\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, I did say playing
  mind games with a lunatic was a bad idea. Lucky for you, this particular lunatic
  is on your side.\r\n\r\nWALL STREET: GAME OVER.\r\n\r\nI sure as hell I don't end
  up getting whacked for coming up with one of the most hilarious you-do-no-want-to-screw-with-ME
  pranks ever.\r\n\r\nIf so, please provide generously for my widow. Some of you folks
  ACTUALLY know who I REALLY AM\u2026\r\n\r\nNOW, would someone offer to buy me a
  beer to toast my old man. He clued me into how you play the players\u2026"

    YOU can make sense of it, let me know. It appears to ME that a whole lot of MY

    this: it ain't funny, but it is ABSOLUTELY REAL.\r\n\r\nP.S. Don't worry: nobody
    else believes that something that is really real is real. It's on the internet.
    Only the obviously fake stuff is real. Or, virtually so\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyone care

  body: "In case anyone is interested\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd, I would presume from the lack
    of response, a lot of people are scratching their heads, but\u2026in an odd way,
    what you see here is frightening. In certain Craigslist's forums, I established
    a cyber-identity as somewhat of a loon\u2014if you can believe that. (Lozos!)
    Why? because I wanted to test a theory: if the solution to a REAL problem is loony,
    evidently, a lot of people who \"reside\" regularly on the internet WILL NOT BELIEVE
    that the problem is real.\r\n\r\nThis same post has been\u2014or is in the process
    of being nuked because the forum regulars REFUSE to believe ANY of it is real:
    even when presented with the evidence you see. Which, when you think about it
    is frightening. Shoot the messenger\u2014if you think that he's a loon\u2014or,
    if someone ELSE \"credible\" says he's a loon\u2014even if the \"credible\" source
    is, himself, clearly an acceptable kind of loon\u2014which generally means hateful
    and confrontational.\r\n\r\nO Joy. The \"virtual\" in virtual reality now means
    that nothing but nonsense is true, and the truth is nonsense. So\u2014don't worry:
    I know that I have gotten a little nutty recently, but there was at least some
    method in my madness. I only wish that what I found out was not true.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, I AM posting it on the internet, so who knows? It might\u2014or
    might not be? Who DOES know? What's up with that? Hell: which was is up?\r\n\r\nNo
    more of that for me: time to settle in among the only sane people on the internet.
    \r\n\r\nRight? Present company excepted. With a few notable exceptions. I DO NOT
    have to name names.\r\n\r\nP.S. So, what I said upfront is true, but the \"bad
    guys\" didn't whack me: the patsies did."

  body: Not sure what perspective I can lend from a conspiracy point of view as here
    in the UK we no doubt have our own fiendishly clever automated financial transaction
    systems (maybe PE-ACH or SEPA) which are a mystery to me. However, a quick search
    around what ACH is has immediately highlighted that they could probably use a
    font to support the related three letter Standard Entry Class (SEC) codes and
    the nifty icons on the "ACH Rules Online" site. Perhaps you are engaging in a
    modern digital Potlatch? I only hope that you are feasting and dancing as well.
