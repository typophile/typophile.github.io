  on, saw it absolutlely <i>everywhere</i>. Does anyone else have an OD memory like
  that?

    at general consumers. Aside from Image Club and Fontek disks &#40;if you could
    find them&#41;, these were the only collections that were affordable for students/nonprofessionals
    at that time. As a result, Industria, Arcadia, Lithos, Copperplate and Tekton
    were absolutely everywhere. More recently -- for me, anyway -- it&#39;s been Bell
    Gothic and Avenir all over the place. <BR> <BR>Most noticeable for me: I can&#39;t
    go to a video store without being bombarded by Trajan. Any shelf you look at in
    the drama/action/suspense sections, you&#39;ll see it on at least 5-10 video boxes.
    Even if movies don&#39;t use it for the logo, they still use it as the headline
    font for all the review quotes. &#40;Super-secret project to come on just this

    video store and couldn&#39;t tell the difference between &#34;Stigmata&#34; and
    &#34;End of days&#34;, judging by the boxes. Same red/black apocalyptic colour
    scheme, Trajan with a red/orange glow...

    in their print &#40;and I know I&#39;ve seen it elsewhere&#41;. Regionally, at
    least one chain of grocery stores uses it and locally? You can&#39;t turn the
    page in the newspaper without seeing it in 9 out of ten ads, every feature article
    that requires a novelty headline... eeagh. It&#39;s so lively and annoying, like
    the pesky little brother you can&#39;t get rid of.

    Tennenbaums,&#34; there&#39;s a funny running type gag in the movie: every written
    object you see, from signage to magazines to hand-written signs, is in Futura.
    It&#39;s everywhere -- creating a surreally uniform and bland environment. &#40;I
    like Futura, but not that much.&#41; Partly as an experiment, I ask non-design
    folks who&#39;ve seen the movie if they noticed the consistent typeface use. So
    far no one has. '

    Comic Sans signs! Those poor students, I predict bad things in their future. <BR>
    <BR>On a related note &#40;sort of&#41;, when I was in elementary school, around
    age 8, the school commissioned and installed an outdoor sculpture in the Mondrian
    / Doesburg / de Stijl vein. It was about 10 feet tall and consisted of a 3-dimensional
    black metal rectilinear framework and flat metal primary-colored panels. It was
    basically like Doesburg designed a jungle gym -- really cool looking and the kids
    were allowed to climb around on it. I thought it was great. Then a group of parents
    started making noise about the school not being traditional enough in its teaching
    methods. The administration responded in part by removing the sculpture &#40;&#34;too
    weird&#34; I guess?&#41; and hauling it off never to be seen again. What was it
    replaced by? Nothing but the hole in the concrete -- the art budget was spent
    and gone. I knew at that tender age that I needed to get the hell out of that
    burg. <BR>Oy.
