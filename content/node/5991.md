body: hi, i was wondering if anyone here could help me.. i&#39;m trying to find companies/logotypes/products
  etc. that show exemplar usages of these fonts for my type class .. i&#39;ve come
  up with a few on my own so far, but Baskerville is still eluding me.. any help on
  any of the four fonts [Garamond, Baskerville, Caslon, or Bembo] would be appreciated!

  body: Gallimard, the French publisher, puts Baskerville to hyperclassy use in their
    &#34;Folio&#34; series of pocket books. <BR> <BR>Fitting, since it was the French
    who saved Baskerville&#39;s punches from oblivion at the hands of his own countrymen.

  body: GE&#39;s corporate typefaces are ITC New Baskerville and Univers. Any piece
    of GE sales literature or packaging should use New Baskerville if a serif typeface
    is used. <BR> <BR>Apple&#39;s corporate typeface is condensed Garamond; they use
    it for absolutely everything.

  body: <i>The New Yorker</i> uses &#40;or used&#41; Adobe Caslon. <i>Critical Review</i>
    uses Bembo on some nice paper. <i>First Things</i> uses ITC New Baskerville, and
    while the paper is good I wish they&#39;d switch to a different Baskerville. <i>The
    New Criterion</i> does wonders with Galliard CC. Strangely, I can&#39;t think
    of any magazines or journals off the top of my head that use a Garamond.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Actually, it makes sense, and it would do the world of
    publishing and graphic design a lot of good, counterbalancing the current emphasis
    on the &#34;art&#34; director. I once witnessed a discussion between two of those
    trying to decide which typeface should go on a shopping bag. After half an hour&#40;!&#41;
    of uninterupted to and fro, one of them suddenly jumped up, a victorious smile
    on his face, and went: &#34;I&#39;ve got it! Let&#39;s use Helvetica!&#34; Djeeez...
