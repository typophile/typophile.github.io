  in the direction of work undertaken by The Foundry, London. I&#39;m aware of all
  the work shown on their website &#40;if you don&#39;t know of them: <a href="http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/"
  target="_blank">http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/</a>&#41;, and of the work they did
  in extrapolating wim crouwel&#39;s  lettering into complete sets, but I&#39;m sure
  I&#39;m missing out on a whole lot of goodness. '

  body: AFAIK Quay has sailed off &#40;pardon the pun&#41; - Sack is the boss now.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Quay was involved in the design of the Yellow Pages typeface <BR>
    <BR>I didn&#39;t know. <BR>Do you have any details &#40;especially close-ups of
    the actual fonts&#41; available? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Ok I stand corrected. Yes J&uuml;rgen Weltin did the Yellow Pages typeface
    but I&#39;m pretty sure David Quay had one eye over his shoulder ;&#41;

  body: Well, Bliss seems better than that Brunel &#40;on same UK style&#42;&#41;,
    or Parisine as economical signage typeface if I refer to my own faces :p <BR>
    <BR>&#42;looklike Brunel is losely based on Bliss?

  body: Of course you didn&#39;t waste that 15 seconds, and it certainly wasn&#39;t
    a waste for Quay &amp; Sack - they got paid for it! But culturally it&#39;s going
    nowhere whatsoever. It&#39;s so generic that at most it&#39;s just a way to save
    money compared to a corporate license of an existing design. <BR> <BR>It reminds
    me of the Dutch phone book phone done by Majoor, which doesn&#39;t even bother
    with trapping! Instead of that MM they should have just gone with a custom instance
    of Myriad-MM. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: the foundry really need to get there fonts selling via an automated purchasing
    system, having to call there office to purchase is a bit of joke for such a fantastic
    foundry.

    here the city councils have enough trouble understanding the concept of marketing
    themselves, let alone commissioning a custom typeface! '

  body: Don&#39;t forget Quay&#39;s pre-Foundry work for Letraset and ITC, especially
    Quay Sans, a contemporary of Meta, and along the same proportions, though with
    its angularity in the lower case, harder edged. <BR>
