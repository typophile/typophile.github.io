  it.\r\n\r\nBut is there anyone outside there who loved FontStudio as I always did
  before?\r\n\r\nStefan"

    is now incorporated into FontLab Studio. The actual pen tool drawing interface
    in FLS could use a bit of the FontStudio touch, but the metrics editing that made
    FontStudio so powerful is available in spades in FontLab.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "I agree that some of the intuitiveness indeed I find in FontLab, too (otherwise
    I wouldn\u2019t work with it).\r\nAnd I am happy about it. Yes, FontStudio was
    very very intuitive and for some type of work as for example spontaneous experimental
    type designs I still am afraid of changing. FontLab is great for real text designs
    and added some great features!! But some little things still I find too complicated
    as for example cutting out entire curve segments. I find it a bit complicated
    to have to cut some points with that knife tool to do so, because otherwise he
    only cancels points instead of the whole segments. Painstaking thing when wanting
    to work very fast with copied segments. (Would be happy if someone teaches me
    right!) But nevertheless..\r\n\r\n>I wonder what kind of tool it would be now
    if it\u2019s development had continued.\r\n\r\nI wonder, too, and most of all
    I always wondered about how anyone could to font designs with Fontographer in
    the past. Horrible program;-)\r\n\r\nSalute to all FontStudio lovers!\r\nStefan"

    I remember the crashes (do a save everytime you make a change and keep a backup
    handy!) I would have to assume that these bugs would have been removed by now

    I found when working with FontStudio was to be able to drop a scanned image into
    a character cell knowing that the program had not distorted or rescaled the image.
    I have made the request to the FontLab developers for a more informative properties
    box for controlling imported images from way back to version 3. Still waiting."
