body: Hello, <BR>I&#39;m working on a book project, and am using InDesign CS for the
  first time. I love the way the type looks compared with quark, but there are so
  many options under paragraph settings &#40;and elsewhere&#41;. I&#39;m wondering
  if anyone has any guidelines they use, particulary concerning min/max wordspace,
  min/max letterspace, and the glyph scaling option. <BR> <BR>This is a photography
  book that will have a total of four pages of text, so I can spend all the time in
  the world tweaking, if need be. The type will be Storm Andulka, 10/15 with 110mm
  column width. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any advice, <BR>Paul
