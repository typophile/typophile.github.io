    he designed [[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ARTbernhard.htm|here]].\r\n<cite>\r\nLucian
    Bernhard was born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1860. Mainly a self-taught artist,
    in 1905 Bernhard won a competition sponsored for the Berlin Chamber of Commerce.
    He began producing posters and quickly established himself as one of the most
    important people working in this field in Germany.\r\nBernhard was employed by
    the German government during the First World War to produce propaganda posters.
    After the war he became Professor of Poster Design at the Berlin Royal Academy.\r\nIn
    1923 Bernhard moved to the United States where he joined with Rockwell Kent to
    establish the New York design company, Contempora. Over the next few years he
    was involved in several projects including the design of 36 different typefaces.
    Lucian Bernhard died in 1972.</cite>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ARTbernhard_6234.jpg]"

  body: "Well, these weird \"ligatures\" were part of my exams.\r\nI did some experiments
    with spacing settings in InDesign. As a result all kinds of ligatures \"popped
    up\". I made some posters with these kinds of shapes; somewhere on the border
    between word and image...\r\nSometimes it anoyes (irritates ?) me when you turn
    on \"discretionary ligatures\", you turn on ALL ligatures. Sometimes I really
    like a 'st' or 'ct' , but I don't want 'he' or 'an' like in Quadraat. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/heden_5454.jpg]"

  body: Is this ligature for the Thai language? I think I have the ligature, but no
    idea about the font itself...

    call this a ligature.\r\nIt was invented in 1962.\r\n"
