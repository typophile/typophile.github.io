  body: Actually that makes perfect sense, do you think InDesign gradient should be
    avoided?

  body: "Vector gradients in any program can result in some nasty banding at large
    sizes, so I would be loathe to use one on a poster unless I really trusted the
    printer to work with me and make sure that the printing comes out right. And if
    you do the whole thing in Photoshop it\u2019s easier to add some noise and make
    the whole thing look more natural."

    application is favoured because of the results.\r\n\r\nWould there even be a difference
    between Illustrator and InDesign?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    and Illustrator produce a vector gradient, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s all
    Postscript. "

  body: I second doing the gradient in photoshop and adding a tad bit of noise to
    it. Vector-based gradients can go horribly wrong. There's quite a discrepancy
    between math-based formulas for color gradations and real-world printed fades.
    The only time I'll use a gradient in Illustrator or Indesign is if it's a very
    subtle fade between similar values of the same color.

  body: "Hi David\r\n\r\nYears ago I knocked up this one for my own amusement; all
    gradients applied within Indesign.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Somedays-poster_5638.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
    James says, the postscript routines in both Indesign and Illustrator are pretty
    much the same thing. However \u2013 <em>vector-based gradients can go horribly
    wrong</em> \u2013 the only time this happened to me was on an A1 poster in which
    the banding was a direct result of the shift between two colours being <em>too
    subtle over too wide a distance</em>. A 10 or 15% shift on one of the plate colours
    was not enough, and the gradient was replaced with a blend containing the maximum
    number of steps. Wearing the cost of remaking the film & proof certainly learnt
    me a lesson..."
