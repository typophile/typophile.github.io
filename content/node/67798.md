body: Does anyone know what typeface this is? The "k" and "v" are unique, it's from
  a hungarian birth certificate from 1912, possibly from a german foundry (based on
  the types used in Hungary at that time).

  body: "Seems surprisingly modern looking to me, but I looked through Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia
    of Type Faces\" Lineale section and no sans like this showed up. Now your best
    hope may be that someone revived it. Something does seem familiar about those
    letters, so you may be in luck.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    that has been digitized, but so far I have been unable to find it. Anyone else
    recognize it?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
