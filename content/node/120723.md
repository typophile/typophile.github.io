body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nSo... I've no idea why, but whenever I type \"/\" on my keyboard,
  when trying the font I'm designing, the slash doesn't appear. But then when I type
  \"/\" again, and it appears. So, every time I type \"/\" 2 times, only 1 \"/\" appears
  on my screen.\r\n\r\nIt happens in both FontLab preview and Illustrator. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nSorry
  if somebody already posted this, I looked for another post with a solution but couldn't
  find anything.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "To preview glyphs that aren't on your keyboard, the slash is a delimiter
    to indicate a glyph name. For instance, \"r/eacute sum/eacute\" in the plaintext
    field gives you \"r\xE9sum\xE9\". This necessitates \"//\" to mean \"this is not
    a delimiter, the following is not a glyph name, just put a slash here.\" Nothing
    is wrong with your font. I didn't know there was a similar feature in Illustrator,
    but there must be."

    curious if Illustrator indeed has a similar feature.

    anything on Illustrator other than just using the Text tool, just as I use it
    for everything with no weird settings nor anything."
