  body: The still is from "The Trouble With Harry" (1955), directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
    The character, Mrs. Wigg, is not the artist who painted the pictures. She's trying
    to sell them at a roadside stand for one of the other characters, Sam Marlowe
    (played by John Forsythe), who is the artist. (Who actually painted the pictures
    for the movie is another question.)

    [[http://www.saulsteinbergfoundation.org/|Saul Steinberg]], who did the drawing

    site]]claims Steinberg was \"riffing on images from the paintings of Paul Klee\"
    because Hitchcock collected and was influenced by Klee (Klee's influence on Hitchcock
    is noted in many places)."

  body: I poked around some more, and [[http://www.alfredhitchcockgeek.com/2007/06/nevinson-world-war-ii-and-dream.html|this
    site]] says the Marlowe paintings were done by John Ferren. A number of other
    sites say that Ferren was the artistic consultant on <em>Harry</em>. Ferren's
    style is in the ballpark.

    recently, and very peculiar it is too. \r\n\r\nOne of Hitchcock's lesser known
    films; not really in the same vein as any of his others. It's hard to know if
    it's a comedy or not."

    role. Not much typography in this movie as it all takes place in rural settings
    - except for the lemonade stand sign made by Shirley's character, if I remember
    rightly.  How about a thread devoted to typography in Hitchcock?   Or, as in this
    case, Hitchcock in typography?\r\nclick on 'Hitchcock conce a Garamond here':
