    of Book Antiqua and Arial.

    right? Comic Sans is much looser than this.

  body: It&#39;s poorly hinted. It is a copy of the idea of casual type and looks
    way to close to Comic Sans. Comic Sans was not suppose to ship with windows it
    was suppose to ship and was made for an application. So SHAME on Apple to make
    a font that looks like Comic Sans. Now when will we see BanChalkboard. <BR> <BR>I
    made it to solve a problem with Microsoft Bob not to put into your computer. Apple
    made a similar font to put in your computer, didn&#39;t hint it properly and should
    be slapped for its bad choice. Show your face Chalkboard designer!!!! <BR>

    isn&#39;t the same as a comic book font&#39; Correct it isn&#39;t it&#39;s just
    like some but not a copy of any. I can prove it in the future. It is not Book
    Antiqua or Arial ... but Chalkboard is EXACTLY Book Antiqua or Arial!!! <BR> <BR>If
    Comic Sans is so bad why make one like it!!!!  <BR> <BR>Shame on you Apple! <BR>

  body: Vincent, I can see why you might be upset over this new font, but the truth
    is, you don&#39;t have a lock on the market for casual handwriting fonts.  If
    Apple wants to create a new design that just happens to bear some resemblance
    to Comic Sans, they have every right to do so.

    glyphs to make sure, and if the overall impression of the two fonts is the same
    to a font freak, they&#39;re certainly too close for the general public &#40;not

    for this: lots of people are spec&#39;ing Comic Sans for websites, so now they
    can spec &#39;font-family: Comic Sans, Chalkboard&#39; and Mac users can see tacky
    websites as intended. As with Book Antiqua &#40;for which, it should be noted,
    Microsoft made reparations in licensing Palatino Linotype&#41;, the goal here
    is typographic parity between operating systems.'

    are. To make a font that is &#39;similar&#39; to Comic Sans and after I&#39;ve
    taken so much crap from idiots who hate Comic Sans. As it is my fault. Which it
    is not, I didn&#39;t put it in Windows, someone else did.  <BR> <BR>It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
    funny to see Apple copy something that is hated so much... LMAO... as they say....

    it&#39;s all over the place? No &#34;decent&#34; corporation cares what a minority
    of specialists thinks. And &#34;hate&#34; is too strong. For most of us it&#39;s
    just a fun tease/release, or at most a way to lambast public ignorance. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    this all is secondary to the fact that Apple is engaging in design plagiarism,
    instead of what MS did: pay a leading type designer to make them some original
    fonts. The least they could have done is just continue using the great MS fonts.

    are the same. it is slightly lighter than Comic Sans.  <BR> <BR>It was finished

  body: Vinnie,  <BR> <BR>Apart from the obvious legal and ethical reasons, why shouldn&#39;t
    Apple jump on the bandwagon? If Peter Lofting were part of the Ban Comic Sans
    brigade &#40;I don&#39;t recall a sticker on the back of his Mini&#41; then producing
    this font would be a bit two faced, but as you say Apple has been a huge supporter
    of Comic Sans for many years, so why not do a similar font?  <BR> <BR>Comic Sans
    is hugely popular, and is used in mainstream advertising on a large scale. I don&#39;t
    doubt for one second that many of these commercial uses of Comic Sans are generated
    on the Mac. <BR> <BR>As for the hinting quality, as I understand it hinting is
    not a priority for Apple - subpixel antialiasing all the way on screen, and the
    pros using the font for the next big ad&#39; campaign are used to working with
    un-hinted fonts. <BR> <BR>It may not be a case of &#39;think different&#39; but
    it&#39;s certainly fulfilling a need for Apple&#39;s core market - professional
    graphic designers. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR> <BR>

  body: 'As the founder of the ban comic sans campaign I&#39;m probably as familiar
    with Comic Sans as just about anyone save Vincent himself. As a self-proclaimed
    Comic Sans expert, allow me to offer this amateur criticism of the Comic Sans
    wanna-be, Chalkboard: <BR> <BR>The poseur font lacks the angular components which
    offset the vertical stress of the main strokes in the lowercase characters such
    as m,n, and h. The overall effect of angular vs. square lending Comic Sans much
    of its spontaneous and &#34;fun&#34; quality is missing. Hinting aside, Chalkboard
    is a second-rate imposter face. <BR> <BR>Seeing them side by side makes me loathe
    Comic Sans a little less. <BR>As Apple fonts go, this is worse than Sand. <BR>

    Comic Sans outside its onscreen usage, so I really need to know: do you &#42;really&#42;
    like Comic Sans, Vincent? I mean its letters, its forms, not its overall functionality
    as a system font which is very good. <BR>I&#39;ve broken my head over that so
    many Times and not found an answer. How you, the designer of my beloved Trebuchet,
    could have &#42;drawn&#42; the letters of Comic Sans? <BR> <BR>Please forgive
    me, I think it&#39;s my obsessive care about comics and good lettering &#40;even
    if today&#39;s computer and not hand lettering&#41;. <BR>Chalkboard: its unethical,
    it&#39;s unhinted, OsX antialiasing sucks &#40;it makes even Georgia look ugly&#41;,
    but people using Comic Sans IN PRINT everywhere &#40;I have just noticed a Hair
    Salon with their logo set on it, tremble&#41; will hardly notice the difference.
    <BR>And you may hate me for this, but if forced to choose just among two digital
    fonts in a post-atomic world where you need to do comic book lettering with a

    sure you, Vincent, could do a better job of a &#39;Comic Sans Regular&#39; to
