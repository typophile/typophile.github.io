  and magic. And I'm looking for a typeface that gives some sort of magic/occult connotations.
  The closest thing yet is maybe [[http://www.vllg.com/Underware/Fakir/mudTyper+Weights/|Fakir]]
  by Underware but I'm looking for something a bit more legible and not necesarily
  inspired by blackletter. Any suggestions?"

    practitioners are thick within the computer programming and science communities,
    which take a decidedly more technical approach that embraces the best linguistic
    and brain science."

  body: Ooh! A lot of spooky stuff here. I especially like the Pentagramme-Pentagraf
    thing. The devil is in the details i guess. That also made me think of [[http://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=9|Didot
    Elder]] with it's discreet "devils tails", although that might be too subtle.

  body: "Any luciferian iconography is strictly in relation to how things are defined
    by the religious communities. \r\n\r\nI would strongly suggest you look at current
    Gnostic and Rosicrutian practices, the OTO, Kali, and a variety of other cross-cultural
    strains that have some intellectual underpinnings as this may help you put things
    together in a context that is broader than pointy tails and Ouija boards.\r\n\r\nIt
    is with great reservation that I post this here, but I have a very dear friend
    that is an author in the field. The interviewer here seems  determinately confused,
    but Bill\u2019s comments are studied and sometimes even informative.\r\n\r\nhttp://freemantv.liber.us/2008/01/25/bill-whitcomb-interview/\r\n\r\nYou
    might find this interesting. If so you would likely find Bill willing to comment
    in regards to your current project. Let me know if you would like contact information.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    craft origins than the posh civilization architects that the group evolved into.
