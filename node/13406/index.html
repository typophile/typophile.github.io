<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, are you sure you have that Goudy quote correct? It is normally cited as 'lowercase', not 'blackletter'. Letterspacing blackletter is actually a well established convention to indicate emphasis, in the absence of italics, which has been practiced in Germany and other countries with long blackletter traditions, for at least two centuries.</div>

<div class=commentbody><strong>John,
I believe Tiffany got the quote all right.
When Goudy in 1936 recieved a handlettered certificate of excellence set in a heavily letterspaced uppercase blackletter, those were the words he uttered.
The reason why it has changed over the years is not as much a mis-quotation as sometimes is suggested but rather a sort of evolution. I mean, it has a good punch to it, and lower case are easier to relate to.
My guess, for what it's worth.</strong>

<div class=commentbody>A type of revolutionary novelty may be extremely beautiful in itself; but, for the creatures of habit that we are, its very novelty tends to make it illegible, at any rate to begin with.
<em>Typography for the Twentieth-Century Reader</em>
<strong>[[Aldous Huxley]]</strong>
Type design moves at the pace of the most conservative reader. The good type-designer therefore realizes that, for a new fount to be successful, it has to be so good that only very few recognize its novelty.
<em>First Principles of Typography</em>
<strong>[[Stanley Morison]]</strong>
Type well used is invisible <em>as</em> type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words, ideas.
<em>Printing Should Be Invisible</em>
<strong>[[Beatrice Warde]]</strong>
If you remember the shape of your spoon at lunch, it has to be the wrong shape. The spoon and the letter are tools; one to take food from the bowl, the other to take information off the page... When it is a good design, the reader has to feel comfortable because the letter is both banal and beautiful.
<em>Keynote Speech/Type90</em>
<strong>[[Adrian Frutiger]]</strong>
When we experience disappointment with the relationship with letters let's not be afraid to do what come naturally to us: Let's draw.
<em>Graphis Typography 1 (1994)</em>
<strong>[[Gerard Huerta]]</strong>
As we say in Berlin, there are many ways to bake a parrot.
<em>Rhyme & Reason</em>
<strong>[[Erik Spiekermann]]</strong>
Yes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, John and Fredrik
<strong>"Men who would letterspace lower case would shag sheep" - [[Frederick Goudy]]</strong>
I noticed the discrepancy in the quote a while ago, so i had looked into it. Thats what I came up with. I wonder if there is a definitive source for this.
I saw some letterspaced lowercase the other day. Blarg. I'm sure letterspaced blackletter is equally hideous, never tried it, thats a good thing right?
Tiff, I've actually never heard that version before. I've heard the ' lowercase would steel sheep.' I prefer the 'sheep shag' version myself, but it'd be nice to find out for sure. It makes more sense if you think about it. Other than being theft of personal property, what is so disgusting about 'stealing' sheep anyway? So, if stealing sheep isn't exactly looked upon as repulsive, the shagging makes a little more sense. But I'm no goudy expert. </div>

<div class=commentbody><em>I’m sure letterspaced blackletter is equally hideous, never tried it, thats a good thing right?</em>
The keynote speaker at the [[ATypI]] conference in Copenhagen referred to a lovely typographic metaphor in one of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s books. In the original, blackletter edition approved by the author, who took a keen interest in the typography of his books, the metaphor relates a feeling of existential alienation and disconnection to being l e t t e r s p a c e d. In a later edition, typeset in antiqua (roman) type, the typesetters interpreted the letterspaced blackletter as italics, as was normal in resetting in antiqua from blackletter originals, and then, since the metaphor was now lost, actually changed the text. So in this later edition the existential alienation was bizarrely likened to being <em>italicised</em>.</div>

The restrictions of two-dimensional communication appealed to my need for structure and my desire to have my work speak for me. The challenge of communicating an idea or feeling within the further confines of the Latin alphabet lad me from graphic design into type design.

<div class=commentbody>This one was used on the TypeCon2001 materials:
"We are type designers, punch cutters, type founders, compositors, printers and bookbinders from conviction and with passion. Not because we are insufficiently talented for other, higher, things, but because to us the highest things stand in the closest kinship to our own crafts." - [[Rudolf Koch]]

<div class=commentbody>"Type production has gone mad, with its senseless outpouring of new types… only in degenerate times can personality (opposed to the nameless masses) become the aim of human development" – Jan Tschicold; The New Typography; 1928
"All the old fellows stole our best ideas." – Frederic Goudy; date unrecorded
"The shapes of letter do not derive their beauty from any sensual or sentimental reminiscences. No one can say the O's roundness appeals to us only because it is like that of an apple or of a girl's breast or of the full moon. Letters are things, not pictures of things." – Eric Gill; Autobiography; 1940
"I fought linotype and montype for some time because it would not justify as well as handset could be made to do; but at last, as always happens, the machine outdid the hand, and got all the best types on it." – George Bernard Shaw; Letter to Ruari McLean, 28/3/1949

<div class=commentbody><strong>Losing Sleep</strong>
<em>by Ephram Edward Benguiat</em>
The following passages are taken from an undated typewritten manuscript. It's very likely these were used as notes for one of Ed's speaking engagements. There is no known date of publication.
<em>"To me designing has never been a job or profession. It's a way of life, like a priest or rabbi."</em>
<em>"Doing something a long time does not mean you're good. It only means you've done it a long time."</em>
<em>"Doing something and getting paid for it doesn't mean you're doing it well. It only means you're doing it."</em>
<em>"I don't think that success is the premise to what is good or bad."</em>
<em>"The contributions that one makes in typography, design, and art in general cannot be, and must not be measured on how much money is involved. That would lead to total chaos. The word itself (contribution) is to give to a common purpose."</em>

<div class=commentbody>Some of my faves:
"People who love ideas must have a love of words. They will take a vivid interest in the clothes that words wear." - [[Beatrice Warde]]
"Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts. Sculpture in stone alone comes near it in obstinacy." [[Jan Tschichold]], Homage to the Book, 1968
"Each letter should have a flirtation with the one next to it." [[Mac Baumwell]]
"Writing is not a series of strokes, but space, divided into characteristic shapes by strokes." [[Gerrit Noordzij]]
"The most popular typefaces are the easiest to read; their popularity has made them disappear from conscious cognition. It becomes impossible to tell if they are easy to read because they are commonly used, or if they are commonly used because they are easy to read." - [[Zuzana Licko]]</div>

<div class=commentbody>I found another version of Beatrice Warde's quote and think this one is better:
"People who love ideas must have a love of words, and that means, given a chance, they take a vivid interest in the clothes which words wear."
And two more:
"Typography, a perfect fusion of form and meaning in which beauty is born, is raised from mere craft and can claim the title of a philosophy; for it also includes ethics, that enobling factor of man's destiny. Thus the printed word is in touch with the spirit." - Raul Mario Rosarivo, 1951.
"Any work of art that makes us feel the artist tried too hard lacks clarity."

<div class=commentbody>Some additional info on Erik Spiekermann's paraphrase of Goudy's quote --
Source:
<strong>Stop Stealing Sheep</strong>
& find out how type works
<em>Erik Spiekermann & E.M. Ginger</em>
First printing: December 1992
Copyright &#169; 1993 Adobe Systems
On the first page of text, Erik added a sidebar to explain his use of Goudy's quote:
<em>In 1936, Frederic Goudy was in New York City to receive an award for excellence in type design. Upon accepting a certificate, he took one look at it and declared that "Anyone who would letterspace black letter would steal sheep."</em>
Eric goes on to mention:
<em>You might have noticed that our book cover reads "lower case," while here it reads "black letter" -- two very different things.</em>
He then added a small sample of CAPITALS, lower case and black letter (printed in black letter) to illustrate the difference to the uninformed reader.
Eric continues:
<em>We're not sure how "black letter" got changed to "lower case," but we've always known it to be the latter; whichever way, it makes infinite sense.</em>

<div class=commentbody>'If you don't get your type warm it will be just a smooth, commonplace, third-rate piece of good machine technique - no use at all for setting down warm human ideas - just a box full of rivets... By jickity, I'd like to make a type that fitted 1935 all right enough, but I'd like to make it warm - so full of blood and personality that it would jump at you.

<div class=commentbody>[[Helvetica]] is the jeans, and [[Univers]] the dinner jacket. Helvetica is here to stay . [[Adrian Frutiger]]
In a way, The Beatles are the Helvetica of pop; just like Helvetica is The Beatles of typefaces . Experimental Jetset
If you have no intuitive sense of design, then call yourself an "information architect" and only use Helvetica . [[David Carson]]
Anyone who uses Helvetica knows nothing about typefaces . [[Wolfgang Weingart]]
I discovered that I never really used Helvetica but I like to look at it. I like the VW beetle, too, although I've never driven one . [[Stefan Sagmeister]]
I have never designed a logotype without first trying it in Helvetica. It is still the most versatile, classic and readable of all typefaces. [[Steff Geissbuhler]]
Any good typeface can be completely destroyed when misused or extensively overused. Helvetica seemed to sustain a beating like no other. Still fresh, still popular Helvetica is king . [[Alexander Gelman]]
There was once a typeface that had the reputation of being more legible and functional than all the others. It was used everywhere and for everything, from signs to logos. Then one day readers couldn't stand seeing it anymore and decided to stop reading it – despite its superior legibilty. Bit by bit designers forgot about it and it was only used by lay people. Then it was rediscovered for a while and in fashion again. Even books were published about it . [[Ruedi Baur]]
Helvetica is the typeface for a deserted island . [[Friedrich Friedl]]
We hate to like Helvetica . [[Hamish Muir]]
I remember a time at Yale when my work was being critiqued by [[Paul Rand]]. Mr. Rand told me only to use Helvetica as a display face never in text, then he squinted, leaned in, and whispered in my ear, "because Helvetica looks like dogshit in text" . [[Kyle Cooper]]

<div class=commentbody>I found this in David Jury's About Face: Reviving the rules of Typography, 2004. It's an anonymous quote and not really about typefaces per se, but I thought you'd enjoy it nonetheless:
Eye halve a spelling chequer
It came with my pea sea
It plainly marques four my revue
Miss steaks eye kin knot sea.
Eye strike a quay and type a word
And weight four it too say
Weather eye yam wrong or write
It shows me strait a weigh.
As soo as a mist ache is maid
It nose bee fore two long
And eye can put the era rite
Its rare lee ever wrong.
Eye have rune this poem threw it
I am shore yore pleased two no
its letter perfect awl the weigh
My chequer tolled me so.

<div class=commentbody>"…a work of art, i.e. a thing made by a man who, however laughable it may seem to men of business, loves God and does what he likes, who serves his fellow men because he is wrapped up in serving God — to whom the service of God is so commonplace that it is as much bad form to mention it as among men of business it is bad form to mention profits."
"I think it is generally agreed that picture writing was the beginning of our lettering. You might wish to communicate something to someone at a distance. If you have no letters or none common both to you & your correspondent, what else can you do but draw a picture? — the language of pictures is common to all. After a time your pictures are used to signify words and not simply things, and as the system develops and communications become more precise, the pictures become simpler and simpler, more & more conventional, and they come to signify single sounds rather than whole words. And the pictures, by now, have ceased to be pictures. They are, by now, hardly recognizable as representations of things: they are conventional signs, & their pictorial origin is forgotten."

<div class=commentbody><em>There is a distinct advantage in being a practising typographer when it comes to deciding on a new typeface design. There seems little sense in designing faces that will not be profitable for the typesetter and it happens too often that designers tend to go down just one path as opposed to designing the variety of faces needed to ensure a good mix. As a result, their designs tend to look too much like each other.</em>

That's a bit bizarre, coming from Les. He would go on to reuse the same skeleton a lot, doing different serif treatments, etc. After all, that's a productive, profitable way to work.
But he was right in a sense, in that if his AD clients liked the way Flange set, they would also like a version of it with more substantial serifs, or more contrast.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Will Burtin, in the Foreword to Ben Rosen's 1963 Type and Typography: The Designer's Type Book, says "Each typeface is a piece of history, like a chip in a mosaic that depicts the development of human communication. Each typeface is also a visual record of the person who created it — his skill as a designer, his philosophy as an artist, his feeling for... the details of each letter and the resulting impressions of an alphabet or a text line."</div>

This is where I got my info. Go fig.
Bonus Question.
Were you really told to “stop stealing sheep,” or is that a watered down version of what was said for letter-spacing all caps?
frederick goudy said that "men who would letterspace lower case would shag sheep', as that was (and is) considered a cardinal sin by typographers. Letterspacing caps, however, is done and should be done generously.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In Erik's book <em>Stop Stealing Sheep & find out how type works</em>,
he admits to not knowing Goudy's <em>exact wording</em>, but that "it makes infinite sense" regardless of wording.
So let's not take Erik's versions as historically accurate, just rhetorical.
When Mr. Goudy made his statement, he obvioulsy knew it was a <em>faux pas</em> since apologized profusely by saying he <em>says that about everything!</em>
IMHO, the "blackletter" and "steal sheep" version seemed more likely since he was being presented an award (certificate with blackletter?) at a public forum.
Also, IMHO, "shag sheep" seems to be more of Welsh origin, and Goudy was American born and bred, so if he did ever used the term "shag," he more than likely got it from his father who probably told young Frederic to <em>stop shagging sheep</em> ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>A bit away from this topic (I`m not font designer), but I found my own quote in my designmagazin published online for about 6 years funny.

Translated from german:
Typografie is the true kickass, believe me. It makes you crazy and compliant again and again. It plays "cat and mouse" game with you.
It, the science for itself, inspires you with its ability to transplantation and transfusion the thoughts. It never leaves you in the pass...

<div class=commentbody>Since there are several traditional ways to create emphasis with blackletter, including letterspacing, second color, substitution of a roman font, and, given the date of the award, 1936, my understanding is that Goudy's comment had to do with the growing anti-German sentiments of the time period.

<div class=commentbody>A further note regarding the possibility that Goudy's now infamous quote was at the time a slur on Germany made as a point for engaging his audience; this culled from The Book Collector's Packet of 1939. A boycott on "Nazi-made types" was undertaken in the U.S. by the Graphic Arts Forum, "a group of democratically minded graphic arts and advertising people." The banned typefaces included Bauer Bodoni, Bernhard Modern, Eve, Futura, Kabel, Neuland, Trafton, and Weiss.

<div class=commentbody><cite>“Men who would letterspace blackletter would shag sheep” - Frederick Goudy</cite>
That is the correct quote. E. Ginger did the research for "Stop Stealing Sheep", and she actually spoke to an old lady who had been to the event and heard Goudy say the "s" word. Patrick Ames, then publisher for Adobe Press, loved the quote, suggested it as the title for the book and changed it, for obvious reasons. The book <em>was</em> intended for typographic novices, and those were obviously not deemed grown-up enough for real four letter words. I always thought the titel way too obscure, but I do have a collection of model and toy sheep (too small to shag), because lots of friends think it very funny to give me sheep as presents.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I am surprised that a direct recollection confirms the saltier version of the Frederic W. Goudy quote on letterspacing blackletter (or lower-case). After all, he is an American type designer, not a British one, and the quote dates from a time prior to the release of the Austin Powers movies.
Reading the posts here led me to search out this page:
http://berlinbooks.org/brb/2009/11/typocalyse-now-the-legacy-of-jan-tschichold/
When I was a child, I naïvely thought that serifs were an unnecessary and old-fashioned complication to the forms of letters. Thus, Jan Tschihold's youthful folly is entirely understandable. I propose that it was shared, in a different form, more widely than may have been recognized.
When printing began, printed books imitated manuscripts. Since the letters were formed at one point, when the matrices were made, why not use the form of letter that is esteemed as the best one - the one that is the most elaborate, that requires the most effort to make?
Despite habit, I suspect that the issues of readability with regard to blackletter were noticed by some even at the very beginning. The rapid emergence of rotunda and bastarda typefaces would seem to confirm this.
Incidentally, because rotunda and bastarda were very readable, I think it regrettable that this line of development did not continue to be followed in the creation of text types. While Lydian is readable, it is still unlikely to be used for text, and, while Optima could be said to be related, it is derived from Roman and sans-serif typefaces, and does not belong to this line of evolution at all.
The fact that Roman types were used for Latin text might be put down to authenticity alone. But the fact that blackletter was suitable for the vernacular - the reader's native language - while Roman was used for texts that are in an ancient language which the reader had learned as a second language seems to me another indication that Roman was regarded as more legible all along.
Also, in the early days of printing, it was difficult enough for printers to cast their own blackletter and roman fonts in a range of sizes. The Roman of Aldus Manutilus closely resembled that of Nicholas Jenson, and the Roman of Claude Garamond was patterned after that of Aldus Manutilus. Printers tended to use one style of roman face and stick to it.
Obviously, if one is only using one roman face, and one is cutting one's own punches, there will be motivation to make the best ones possible, and one's own personality and limitations and handwriting will all be reflected. So there will be change over time. Thus, Caslon, Baskerville, and Bell all emerged from this type of evolution, as well as Bodoni.
Given, then, that the world was emerging from a period when printing shops only had a very limited set of typefaces, it's not surprising that Jenson, Poliphilus, Bembo and Garamond all had to be revived. With only Caslon - and, later, oldstyle faces based on the one by Alexander Phemister - as competition, it's also not surprising that Scotch Roman faces - which attempted to soften the characteristics of Bodoni much as Gill Sans, later, was considered a humanist sans-serif - became the fashion.
In this earlier day, their unbracketed serifs were seen, like the lack of serifs on Helvetica, to be an abandonment of useless, unnecessary ornament. But everything needful for legibility - serifs of some sort, classical proportion - was retained.
I see Times Roman as being like Caslon - a "sweet spot" that will stay popular for a long time. When in doubt, set it in Times... is, in effect, already the maxim that the same thing, said about Caslon, once was. In the area of sans-serif, Stone and Lucida seem to be today's fashion.
When Caslon fell, the earlier oldstyle types not being available, it led to the Scotch Roman epoch which looks so dismal to today's eyes.
When Times Roman falls, though, technical factors will not pressure us to use overly condensed letters. Nor will the designs of Baskerville or Bembo be hidden and unavailable. So there is no reason for the fashions of the future to give us a long, depressing era dominated by typefaces which, to their posterity (as well as our eyes, if we could see them) look awful and thus make their popularity inexplicable.

<div class=commentbody>Type is like music in having its own beauty, and in being beautiful as an accompaniment and interpretation; and typography can be used to express a state of the soul, like the other arts and crafts. But like them it is too often used mechanically, and so the full expressiveness of this medium is unrealized. If it is used according to a rule or recipe, it becomes dull and loses vividness. Type appears at first to be a rigid medium; but like other rigid media, it is plastic to the living spirit of a craftsman.

"I think it's rather difficult to create a new typeface design, or for that matter, to create a new anything that's in everyday use. A new piece of music would parallel the creation of a new typeface. For example, the notes of music don't change, and the letters of the alphabet don't change, either. It's a matter of how they're put together. The most important feature must be that its newness has a reflection all its own and fits into the pattern of today's generation of graphic designers. The new creation must have something in its character that makes the potential user sit up and take notice. These typographic traits could create a popular demand but we must also consider that this popularity may only be a temporary. Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I know we all feel our designs will last forever, but some things like music don't last either. It's like 'here today and forgotten tomorrow.' Anyway, you and I can be sure of one thing: the number of typefaces will surely increase." —Ed. Benguiat

I don't agree with some of his opinions. I am particularly referring to his statement that there aren't more than a handful of good fonts. I wouldn't dismiss anything he has to say about type or typography though.
I like this quote and I think he makes a good point. It has become much easier to make a typeface due to the computer and the result is a lot of bad typefaces. It is clever the way he compares desktop publishing to the medical industry.</div>

The computer may have made it a bit easier to make a typeface, and there are no doubt many really crappy typefaces out there, but it has also give the graphic design industry the largest collection of great typefaces in history.

<div class=commentbody>Massimo sounds like he was just lamenting the loss of revenue to others. In his era (and mine) designers made most of their money on fairly mundane work that was simple to design and could easily be turned over to lesser-paid staff. We used to call this grunt work. This freed up the top-dogs to spend more time on show pieces yet still collect on the grunt work done by their staff. It was a steady moneymaker with plenty of repeat business--as in "update this monthly catalog with new prices". Yes, the computer turned this into a database publishing issue with automated regional versioning and distribution. Yes, there also was a huge birth of hack designers now in the workforce who knew noting about design but plenty about software usage. So goes the world. We have always had competition to deal with. Some of it was only in price and not in quality. If a client didn't give a damn about good design, he hired a hack and saved a few bucks. That is the way the world works, Massimo. Get over it already--it is 2011 now, not 1965. The NYC grip also faded with the internet. You did not have to be a 5 minute cab ride to all the big clients to get their work any more. Sure, now you can get both crap design and good design from Manhattan to Malaysia. Welcome to the global economy, we are all better off for it except a very few of the elite and late adopters perhaps. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul, I couldn't find it flipping through <em>Letters of Credit</em> either, which was the reason I was hesitant in my original post in this thread. I still don't know. Just checking, I do see that Tina Parker, above, is right about it being in <em>Font, Logo, and Lettering Bible</em> by Leslie Cabarga. And there it quotes Matthew Carter (p. 200): "As the saying goes, type is a beautiful group of letters, not a group of beautiful letters." Evidently Carter thinks he got it from somewhere else. I believe that in a Typophile thread, David Berlow confirmed that it was originally Walter Tracy, but with no reference.
It could be that I heard it aurally from Matthew Carter at TypeCon, with a reference to Tracy, but I can't remember. So to solve the mystery you might ask Matthew Carter.

<div class=commentbody>Christopher, regarding Müeller-Brockmann, he would do as he always did, use flush-left Helvetica ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I specifically asked Matthew about that “beautiful collection of letters” <em>bon mot</em> last year, his response was, “I'm sure I heard it from Mike Parker, but where he heard it I don't know.”</div>

<div class=commentbody>Interesting, Kent. Parker and Tracy were heads of typeface development at Linotype US and UK respectively, at the same time, so it's quite possible that Parker heard it from Tracy. It's still an open question, but we're getting closer to the answer. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It seems to me you just got further. :-)
I guess now ask Mike.

<div class=commentbody>Hi,
I'm <a href="https://plus.google.com/104950504255377185080/about?rel=author">Saadi.</a>
I don't know who said this quote: "Stay true to your form no matter where you are."
When I read it I knew it was perfect to expose the beauty of a font. So I did this experimental video with two of my friends for FUTURA.
Please let me know what you think. Here's the link.

<div class=commentbody>I just noticed that, astoundingly, one of my favorite quotes is missing from this thread. Another quote from the same person is present, and a quote from a different individual expressing a similar idea is present... but this famous quote is not:
<cite>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.</cite>
<cite>Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you will find that almost all the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography.</cite>
Beatrice Warde
Actually, looking at her essay, I see why: it doesn't contain a single short quote giving its point, although somewhere else I had seen a quote from her doing so.
Ah, wait: this will do (and, in fact, <em>was</em> what I was looking for but initially missed) -
<cite>Type well used is invisible as type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words, ideas.</cite>
One could also say that her metaphor is out of date. Crystal is glass which calls attention to itself because it has had lead oxide added to it to increase its refractive index, causing it to sparkle. Lead can leach out into the wine, sweetening it. (And, for that matter, one of the virtues of gold is that it is highly resistant to chemical attack, unlike many other metals, so it is not unsuitable to hold wine. Wine <em>is</em> meant to be tasted, not looked at.)
So the ideal wine goblet would perhaps be of something more resistant, such as borosilicate glass.
@Chris Dean:
At least Josef Müller-Brockmann will never fall (or, rather, sadly, had never fallen) into the hubristic mistake once famously made by one of the Beatles.
But I will take note of the opinion that our salvation is to be found in the Swiss grid system.</div>

<div class=commentbody>“<em>There is no end to the maze of practices in typography, and this idea of printing as a conveyor is, at least in the minds of all the great typographers with whom I have had the privilege of talking, the one clue that can guide you through the maze. Without this essential</em> humility of mind<em>, I have seen ardent designers go more hopelessly wrong, make more ludicrous mistakes out of an excessive enthusiasm, than I could have thought possible</em>.”
Warde, B. (1955).
