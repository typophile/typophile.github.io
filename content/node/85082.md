    of my research, together with the work of others, were used by Ken Barber for
    the culture-specific stylistic sets in his Studio Lettering Collection:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/studiolettering/fontfeatures\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the diacritical marks, these fonts feature a form that looks like \xF3 for \xF8

    \u0161, \u017E (Czech; h\xE1\u010Dek) \u2013 among other things. They also have
    a proper <a href=\"http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/stroke.html\">double
    ew</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/udistinguisher/\">\u2018German
    u\u2019</a> with hook: not exactly a diacritic, but a distinguishing mark (from
    the \u2018n\u2019) \u2013 a courtesy to the reader, as Ken put it.\r\n\r\nPatterns
    that I have observed and that have not been incorporated in this font set include
    the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/5846129213/in/pool-779590@N22/\">\u2018Swiss
    umlaut\u2019</a> (horizontal bar instead of two dots), and the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tipografiaregional/5536425399/in/pool-779590@N22/\">Portuguese
    habit</a> to sometimes place the tilde more to the right.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind
    that these preferences are all but set in stone. Some are true for handwriting
    only, others for lettering. Just because some letterforms (or accent placements)
    can be found repeatedly \u2013 in some scope of application, place and period
    \u2013 does not make them the default. They can help adding a local and vernacular
    flavour, but just as easily may look dated or odd, even to natives."

  body: "<strong>Source for vernacular Portuguese</strong>\r\n\r\nJames, [[http://nossotipo.wordpress.com/tag/vernacular/|here]]
    you can find examples and even vernacular fonts based on Brazilian Portuguese.
    Hope it helps.\r\n\r\nBTW, this is an interesting thread.\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Portuguese
    tilde</strong>\r\n\r\nFlorian, what you call a habit (to dislocate the tilde to
    the right in Portuguese) is actually an error with interesting historical roots.
    Let me explain.\r\n\r\nThe origin of tilde is medieval Latin. It was an abbreviation
    to n/m (as \"c\u0169\" meaning \"cum\"). Later, tilde become used to indicate
    various vowel nasalization cases before finally being limited to four situations:\r\n\r\n\u2013
    short nasal \"a\" at the end of a word (l\xE3). The sound needs \xE3 because there
    is no final n in Portuguese, except for loan words.\r\n\r\n\u2013 deep nasal diphtongs
    \"\xE3o\", \"\xE3e\" and \"\xF5e\", which resembles to late Latin aun, \xE6n and
    \u0153n.\r\n\r\nPortuguese linguists discussed during 17th and 18th Centuries
    if tilde must be put over the first or the second vowel of these diphtongs. Between
    ~1700 and ~1820 the standard was to write \"a\xF5\" instead of \"\xE3o\". This
    was later changed to the way it is used nowadays, but some people (mostly poorly
    educated ones) kept the old usage.\r\n\r\nIt's an uncommon error, but still found
    in rural zones or old street displays, as these you indicated. But it's plainly
    wrong, an error due to poor alphabetization.\r\n\r\nThis information is valid
    to Portugal and Brazil. I believe this was never an issue in other Portuguese-speaking
    countries as their colonisation was consolidated during 19th-20th Century (Angola,
    Mo\xE7ambique, Cabo Verde) or got frozen since 16th (as Goa, Cant\xE3o and East
    Timor).\r\n\r\nYou can find book samples of a\xF5 usage [[http://www.google.com.br/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=a%C3%B5&btnG=|here]].\r\n.\r\n\r\n<strong>Spanish
    tilde</strong>\r\n\r\nTilde is not changed to a less curved shape in vernacular
    Spanish. What you probably saw were situations where the writer chose to add some
    \"style\" to the diacritic or just did not put much attention to it.\r\n\r\nThis
    is somewhat common both with Spanish tilde and Portuguese cedilla because they
    are unique diacritics in their classes.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish, \xF1 is the only tilde
    possibility. The other diacritic found in this language is acute. As they are
    quite different and there is no n+acute, people can write tilde even as a straight
    line and it remains easily recognizable as tilde.\r\n\r\nThe same with cedilla:
    \xE7 is the only \"under\" diacritic used in Portuguese. So, even if you write
    cedilla as a vertical line or an unconnected comma, everybody will read it still
    as \xE7.\r\n"
