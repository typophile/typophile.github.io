body: I have a font that I'm trying to make a few changes to. The spacing on the numerals
  doesn't work well for our templates so I am trying to adjust that. However, when
  I do that and then try the font, everything else that I haven't edited, moves up
  in the layout program (Quark). Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

  body: It's more likely that the numerals have moved down; or that, somehow, you
    have accidentally repositioned the baseline...
