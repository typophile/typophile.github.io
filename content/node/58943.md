  I am looking for advice about text typography. \r\nI thought about FF Bau, Akzidenz
  Grotesk. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Any serif suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    like Cheltenham might work as a serif.\r\nTake inspiration from [[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/De_Stijl/index.htm|here]]."

    for the texts, eg the Hollandsche Mediaeval.\r\nThis discrepancy between the modernistic/avantgarde
    headings and traditionally styled textmatter has always bothered me.\r\n\r\n.

  body: Good thoughts Bert, it is really hard to make it work - both traditional typefaces
    and geometric ones, and especially layouts for this purpose.
