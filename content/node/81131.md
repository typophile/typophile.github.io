  and it is labeled \"adscript\"\r\nand since I can't find it anywhere I am sure that
  it was just a general name for it.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize this font?"

  body: The Mouldtype foundry (UK) had this as Fashion Script. I have not yet found
    a digitized version, but maybe someone recognizes it.

    I can see now that there are some differences (the s for instance), so maybe my
    ID is not correct."

  body: "Swizzle Script, yes, but if you look at the samples likely identified as
    Stylescript, they have the same s as this one.\r\n\r\n(by the way, aren't you
    happy having found a digitalisation of Fashion Script? ;-)"
