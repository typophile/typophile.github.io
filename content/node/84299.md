body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone could help identify the font being
  used here? \r\n\r\nI'm a bit of a neophyte when it comes to graphic design, but
  I really love the text's multi-colored edges and am not sure if this is actually
  part of the font itself or some kind of particular technique being applied to the
  font.\r\n\r\nAny help would be sincerely appreciated, either font identification
  or anyone who could point me in the direction of where to learn how to do something
  similar (adding multi-colored edges/shadow) to text, thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Soundcrash-Daedelusplusraff_-eFlyer-460x652_6208.jpg]"

    with isometric perspective is easy in Illustrator. Just draw it. Paste some type
    on the canvas twice. Move one some, and draw the shapes in between."
