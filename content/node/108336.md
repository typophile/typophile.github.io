body: "I have been experiencing a really weird font issue; I have no idea how it started,
  but it was not present before. Basically, a bunch of Mac fonts are showing up in
  the font list in some Office programs, but the fonts are not actually installed,
  and I never installed them myself. They don't actually work (using Arial/Times New
  Roman/Courier New as placeholders), and the icon next to the font is not the TrueType/OpenType
  icon. I attached a picture of the issue. Again, I have no idea how they got there,
  but I have no way of deleting them since they don't show up anywhere in the Windows
  fonts folder and restarting the computer doesn't do anything. The fonts also only
  seem to show up in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher, but not OneNote... They
  don't show up in any other application such as WordPad. Has anyone experienced this
  before? I'm pretty confused and am wondering if there's a solution to this.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font

  body: Looking at the symbol in front of the font names, I would guess that a newly
    installed (virtual) printer plays some role in that problem. Check if any software
    has added some device that Windows sees as a printer.
