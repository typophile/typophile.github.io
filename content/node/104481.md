  and requests it to be made identical and with the same font but she doesn't know
  what font it is and refuses to accept a 'close to' font. \r\n\r\nSorry for the bad
  quality my scanner is broken\r\n\r\nHope you can help because i've been looking
  at too many fonts now they all just seem so similar\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!"
