  and contemporary are both ok. My students have done typographic exercises that use
  type to express messages and I was wondering if there is a site showing similar
  exercises or posters out there."

    Most are bookmarked at home, but here are a few right now:\r\n\r\nContemporary
    posters divided into categories: <a href=\"http://www.allposters.com\" target=\"new\">AllPosters.com</a>\r\nA
    great resource on <a href=\"http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/eaa/\" target=\"nes\">Advertising

    you browse through some of the galleries presented on LetterheadFonts.com, you
    can see contermporary designs using \"antique-styled\" typefaces.\r\n- <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/gallery/\"

  body: "Hello Nadine,\r\nIt is difficult to find sites where only typographic posters
    have been created.  There would be many more with images.  My guess would be that
    design schools, probably European ones like the Netherlands, would be the most
    likely resource.  I will look at my bookmarks when I get home.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
