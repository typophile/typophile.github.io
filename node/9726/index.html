<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've taken part in many discussions about the flaws/merits of the various ways of presenting type specimens on the web. But one thing that I've yet to get a handle on is the security aspect (referring to the extraction of fonts by hackers). <br> <br>Bitmaps are of course totally safe (except for bitmap fonts! :-), but they're yucky in so many ways. Even the ones that generate images of user-defined phrases real-time are uninspiring to me. I personally like specimens where you can type "live" (like on http://www.typography.com/ - although I actually think those horizontal jail bars make things worse overall). So if one wants to use a technology which uses the outline font (in one incarnation or another), like PDF, Flash, etc., what are the relative security merits of each? <br> <br>There is general agreement that PDF is not highly secure, but many large, established font houses use them. There is also general agreement that Flash is highly secure, but I've been shown with 90% credibility that it's not. <br> <br>So far I've been using Shockwave* (not Flash), but that was a temporary solution - even though it's been two years now... :-/ So what should I *really* use? <br> <br>* <a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/f_arasan.html target=_top>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/f_arasan.html</a> <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody> Hrant, <br> <br>You're right, PDF is not very secure -- especially with Type 1 fonts -- but I think it's the best format for people who'd like to print test the specimens as well as preview them on screen. <br> <br>I create special versions of fonts to embed in PDFs containing only those glyphs I'm displaying in the file, so if someone were to extract it, they wouldn't have the complete font. I also give them different names so that they appear, to the untrained eye, as some special system font Adobe has embedded (e.g., a name consisting of numbers followed by "_mm"). <br> <br>Another level of protection (in addition to the above) would be to generate the font in TrueType format with the embedding level set to read-only print/preview. <br> <br>I haven't tried that because I figure if someone has the technological savvy to extract fonts, they could also easily change the embed flag. But at least they'd wind up with a TrueType version (this wouldn't make sense if you were designing in TT native, in which case maybe you could embed in T1 format). </div>

<div class=commentbody> > What have you heard about Flash? <br> <br>Heard: <br>That the difference between a protected Flash movie and non-protected one is one byte: you set it to the right value, and you can load up the movie in Flash, and access the font. <br> <br>Seen: <br>About a year ago, to prove a point, somebody emailed me one of my fonts (in TT format - the original was T1) extracted from a Shockwave movie on my site. At that time I had not yet sold any copies of that particular font, but had *possibly* given a single copy to one person (unrelated to the person who emailed me) - I don't remember. <br> <br>> I think [PDF is] the best format for people who'd like to print test the specimens as well as preview them on screen. <br> <br>I agree for printing. But for the screen I see a number of problems with PDF: it's not live; it's big/slow/clunky; and it doesn't integrate into a web environment like Flash does. SVG is supposed to fix some/all of those, but it's not being supported (which I don't mind - SVG just doesn't smell right to me, for some reason). Oh, and what about MS's WEFT/EOT and BitStream's TrueDoc stuff? <br> <br>BTW, I should say that I'm actually a lot less concerned with security than I might have sounded. My motivations in this thread are: <br>1. I just like to *know* what's going on. <br>2. I'll be posting samples of a new font in the Typophile Forums, and would like to avoid having old/incomplete versions floating around by the time I release it. <br> <br>> I figure if someone has the technological savvy to extract fonts, they could also easily change the embed flag. <br> <br>Nice and pragmatic - my cup of tea! <br> <br>hhp </div>

The font is kept external to the file, like in a cache (which is maybe even less safe)? <br>2. The font is converted (as we already know) when it's imported into Flash, so the "native" data is gone?

<div class=commentbody> Peter, the FLA is the native Flash format that you edit and work with. The SWF is the file you export before publishing the file to a site. Just like the difference between a PhotoShop file and a GIF or JPG. So, the ability to use a font in Flash (in the FLA) depends on whether you have it on your system. <br> <br>So, Peter the FLA isn't the file you'd distribute anyway. Pardon me if you already knew this... perhaps I misunderstood you. <br> <br>Hrant, there's no caching of fonts involved. Further, the font is not converted when you use it in Flash. It is however set to outlines when you export it to SWF format. <br> <br>//joe </div>

<div class=commentbody> Yes your are right Joe..I didn't think about that..it's a bit late here... <br> <br>I always thought (this is just an assumption I have no facts) that when you made the SWF from the FLA the font was made into plain vector outlines...like you can do with a font in Freehand & Illustrator.

<div class=commentbody>Peter, you're right. When you export the native <br>Flash file (FLA) to an exported file (SWF) it <br>turns all fonts into outlines. There is no way to <br>export a SWF without turning fonts to outlines. <br> <br>You're also right that Flash only embeds the <br>characters you use in the file. <br> <br>Further--Hrant's second guess is correct--if you <br>use a particular lc k 43 times in a single SWF, <br>the user only downloads one lc k. Flash merely <br>references other instances of the 'symbol.' (This <br>is one of the main reasons SWF is such a brilliant <br>web medium--it's very economical to download.) <br> <br>Let me clarify one last point. When you view an <br>exported Flash file (SWF), you are viewing <br>whatever fonts the creator used in the native <br>Flash file (FLA)--which are only available if <br>that creator had the fonts on his/her system. <br>Viewing fonts in a SWF is totally independent of <br>fonts you have in your system. Sorry if I led you <br>astray. <br> <br>Jared's modesty prevented him from taking credit for <br>building the font preview mechanism at <br>http://www.typography.com. It's 'real time' and is not as <br>cumbersome as some GIF-based mechanisms <br>because it's built with Flash. <br> <br>//joe</div>

If the correct font shows up when a third-party browser accesses the file, it must be *somewhere* in there. Maybe the SWF contains the font *and* a reference to the font, and when you *play* the file it shows up, but when you *reload* it, it doesn't. This would make sense because it avoids unnecessary loss in quality for the author* (if he reloads a SWF). What's really cool is that this in effect might be a great form of font protection!

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> Here's something from the Flash manual: <br> <br>When you use a font installed on your system in a Flash movie, Flash embeds the font information in the Flash SWF file, ensuring that the font displays properly in the Flash Player. Not all fonts displayed in Flash can be exported with a movie. <br>To verify that a font can be exported, use the View > Antialias Text command to preview the text; jagged type indicates that Flash does not recognize that font's outline and will not export the text. <br> <br>As an alternative to embedding font information, you can use special fonts in Flash called device fonts. Device fonts are not embedded in the Flash SWF file. Instead, the Flash Player uses whatever font on the local computer most closely <br>resembles the device font. Because device font information is not embedded, using device fonts yields a somewhat smaller Flash movie file size. In addition, device fonts can be sharper and more legible than embedded fonts at small type <br>sizes (below 10 points). However, because device fonts are not embedded, if users do not have a font installed on their system that corresponds to the device font, type may look different than expected on a user's system. <br> <br>Flash includes three device fonts, named _sans (similar to Helvetica or Arial), _serif (similar to Times Roman), and _typewriter (similar to Courier). To specify a font as a device font, you select one of the Flash device fonts in the Character <br>panel, or select Use Device Fonts in the Text Options panel. You can specify text set in a device font to be selectable, so that users can copy and paste text that appears in your movie. <br> <br>You can use device fonts for static text (text that you create when authoring a movie and that does not change when the movie is displayed) or dynamic text (text that updates periodically through input from a file server, such as sports <br>scores or weather data). </div>

<div class=commentbody>my font was definitely not a device font. it was a truetype i installed on the computer. Device fonts in Flash are the default ones that come with it, so you don't have to embed a font if you don't want to. I've also made the experiment of checking filesize on a .swf file with/without embedding fonts, and there is a difference. <br> <br>::research:: <br>:looked at all the flash resource extractors, none mentioned fonts (which is not positive proof, but it may be a sign) <br>:asked at the forums at flaskit.com... got an answer that fonts cannot be extracted <br> <br> <br>my theory (guess) is that the font is included in the .swf, but in such a way that it is not recoverable by importing the file back into flash. <br> <br>something interesting. found this site: <br><a href=http://www.flash-france.com/ff2001.php target=_top>http://www.flash-france.com/ff2001.php</a> <br>which uses not plain flash, but dynamically generated .swf's using flash generator. perhaps this is even safer?</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the font is included in the .swf, but in such a way that it is not recoverable by importing the file back into flash. <br> <br>I think so too. My suspicion is that the font is "decomposed" into a large set of Flash-specific Library entries (which might also explain why kerning is not available? I mean in the case of "live" typing), which means you'd need a special utility to put it all back together, and I'm not sure you'd get the exact original outline (especially if it's Type1). <br> <br>> <a href=http://www.flash-france.com/ff2001.php target=_top>http://www.flash-france.com/ff2001.php</a> <br> <br>!!! <br>Help, I'm having trouble breathing!

Which means less than one might hope in general. But I'm starting to think Flash is really very safe after all (certainly for me) - the problems I cited at first were I guess related to Shockwave, apparently a very different animal. And if we can get Flash Generator to work easily, then that's probably even much safer. <br> <br>On the other hand, I will soon try to do some of my own tests too (with Flash4). <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Joe's pretty much covered my feedback on this topic. I've always assumed that if anyone were able to extract the vectors, they would have to rebuild the font manually by pasting those vectors back into a tool like Fog. <br> <br>The precaution? When we build the HTF Testdrivers, we included a limited character set just in case someone, someday, was able to extract them. But so far I've never heard of anyone doing it successfully. <br> <br>FWIW, I definately prefer a Flash-based interface over one where it renders type as a pixel-based image. <br> <br>The bigger question in my mind is, Do you mask the specimen or not? Without any visual noise (ie. the horizontal bars at HTF), what's to stop people from setting type and screenshotting it for use on their site, etc? </div>

<div class=commentbody> > Do you mask the specimen or not? <br> <br>No! I thought about this myself, and here's my [typically pragmatic] conclusion: <br>You have to draw an -admittedly- fuzzy line between different types of customers. Some people will buy a font with little coaxing, to be "ethical". Most of these people would buy it even if they could "steal" some (in any case notably limited) renderings. Other people will very seldom pay for type - you have to lure them in. How? Exactly by letting them "steal" your Flash *renderings* (but not the font). You let them become dependent on a font, and many of them will eventually break down and buy the thing, to avoid all those time-consuming screen grabs, or maybe more significantly to eventually use the font for print. I thought about this a lot, and that's why I made my Shockwave renderings as clear as possible: exposure, and addiction. <br> <br>Lose the bars, dude. Set your fonts free, and if they're good they'll go out and bring in customers better than any marketing department ever could. <br> <br>hhp </div>

This is something even Carter for one has said on various occasions. <br> <br>But there might be a special case: <br>If you're showing work-in-progress in public (like in Typophile's Critique forum), there's the issue of pre-release versions floating around, potentially causing great confusion.
