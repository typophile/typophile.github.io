  before. \r\nI wanted to ask what font size did you use. At the moment I have 100pt,
  myriad. \r\nI think I may need to use something more condensed and bold though.
  \r\nIt is to be visible from the road, say about 50-80m away, driving at about 50km.\r\nCheers."

    about 50km.</em>\r\n\r\nRule of thumb: take the size of the type (cap height),
    go to the next unit of measurement (say from cm to m) and the multiply by 3 for
    difficult reading conditions (like from a driving car) or by 2 for normal conditions.
    Or divide the distance by 3 and take the next unit below (you could also simply
    divide by 300, but people often have problems with all those zeros). For 60m that
    would be 20m, next unit down is 20cm. There's your cap height, and that's roughly
    800 point! 100 point would be visible, but not leg\xEDble.\r\n\r\nAnd never use
    bold faces for signage. Bold is not better, as the counters fill up and obscure
    characters. Regular weights are best. When [[Adrian Frutiger]] designed the signage
    at Roissy airport, he made a weight between [[Frutiger]] 55 and 65 for black on
    yellow. For reversed-out signs that would have been the 55 weight. Our [[FF Transit]]
    gives different weights for positive and negative applications, plus back-lit
    and front-lit varieties. And with [[FF Info]], the weights are designed to be
    close enough together to chose neighbouring weights for different lighting conditions."

      on how to handle the size of th efont, only problem with using 800pt on a 40x50cm
      board is that I want get much text on the board, but there could be the problem,
      maybe a board of this size is expecting to much to have eliable type for driving
      past."

    uncle, who was a realtor in a small town here in New Hampshire. I set up the whole
    thing and even wrote the headline:\r\n\r\n\"When you want the lowdown on a New
    England town, ask a native.\"\r\n\r\nIt looked so nicely-balanced and serene taped
    onto my drawing board. Only trouble was, when it actually got put onto the giant
    surface, I drove past it at 45 mph and was horrified to realize that you could
    only read the first five words before you'd gone past the sign!\r\n\r\nSo Stuffy,
    in terms of your mocking up something, perhaps print it out on paper, tape it
    to the wall, and then (I'm not kidding) run past it to see how much of it you
    can see in one gestalt.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite tricks learned from Friedrich
    Neugebauer is the use of a reducing glass -- very handy to see something brought
    down enough in size to judge if its line weights are strong enough, details too
    fussy or not discernible, and so forth, when it actually goes into a newspaper
    column or other given space. "

  body: The simple answer is that your board is way the hell too small! You'll need
    a sign of about 3x6 meters to hold all that text and keep it legible, and at that
    point you're getting into the small billboard category. It is still way too long
    of a slogan for roadway signage.

    not a good idea to begin with. People are not even going to bother trying to read
    lots of text while driving along.\r\nSo you should probably rethink your strategy
    on this. :)"
