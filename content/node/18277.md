body: Three cheers to Simon Daniels who is celebrating his website's <a href="http://www.atypi.org/news_tool/news_rss_html?newsid=354">tenth
  anniversary</a> this week. microsoft.com/typography was created on Feb 27, 1996
  and its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/default.aspx">news page</a>
  is still (and now even more active than ever) the best place on the web to catch
  the various typographic bits and pieces we'd otherwise miss. As a parttime (and
  slacking) reporter of type news I know from firsthand experience that keeping the
  momentum going is a feat, let alone for ten years straight. My hat is off to Simon
  for his dedication. I am very impressed indeed.

    site ever put up on the web. That alone, without it''s outstanding durability
    in a time when so many sites lag of pass out, makes it all the more of a great
    thing that Simon has done. Keep up the good! '
