  specific in their identification requests. Just recently there are far too many
  'What font is this?', 'What is this font?', 'Need help with font' etc.\r\n\r\nIf
  you have some type that says 'August' for example, please name the thread 'August
  type identification' or something similar. We're trying to help you - you could
  do the same for us.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    but who wants to read that when you can just make the same mistakes everybody
    else makes over and over again. :^P\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_2\"><strong>What do I enter
    in the \"Title\" line?</strong></a>\r\nTry to define your type ID request as clearly
    as possible. For example <em>\"1960's newspaper headline face\"</em> or <em>\"Lost
    in Translation movie logo\"</em> or <em>\"retro script\"</em> will do nicely.
    Whereas <em>\"Please help me identify this font\"</em> is pretty pointless as
    that's the only thing we do on the Type Identification Board. Compare it to a
    newspaper where every single headline would say <em>\"Stuff happened!\"</em>"

    Whatthefont-forum is temporarily closed (for some \xBBshiny new\xAB server-updates)
    and the MyFonts-crew <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\">suggests
    to come here or use identifont</a>. \r\n\r\nAnd I may repeat: Thank you for your

  body: "Unfortunately, Nick, your forum topic isn't specific enough either - I thought
    it was just another ID request.\r\n\r\nI'd have called it \"PLEASE MAKE YOUR TITLE
    MORE SPECIFIC\" or something. Gotta shout!\r\n\r\nYves - maybe you need a PLEASE
    READ (in caps) before the FAQ in that title the way they do over in General Discussions.
    It would also help if it could bump to above the quizzes. Maybe maybe then people
    would read it."
