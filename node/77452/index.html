But Arno is right. A webfont is any font when it's used on the Web. As long as it looks good enough on the screen, no-one'll give you grief.

There are dedicated web font formats around: EOT (Internet Explorer), WOFF (Firefox 3.6 and later), Cufon, sIFR, typefaceJS... *swirly eyes*</div>

Does this mean, that myfonts would split Bitstream Charter Pro into a regular and a small cap part for example? Otherwise I can access only the half of the glyphs and therefore it is not really usable as webfont, especially because the license does not allow, that I split it into parts by myself. Sorry, but if I pay for a webfont, I really expect, that I can access all glyphs. So I assume, it actually is a half-baked thing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes. Maybe I don’t expect anymore, that I get, for which I pay, when I am adult. In case of Bitstream Charter Pro you could not access the small caps, if you use it as webfont. But you pay for a webfont. Correct me, if I am wrong, but Myfonts seems to simply put the regular fonts into a woff container. That’s all, isn’t it? And the answer to the silly question, why they do that, is, that it is a very easy way to make money.</div>

Even if we will see browsers, that support OT layout features in the next years, I doubt, that they better work with regard to that, than Office for example. Additionally I try to create websites, that are backwards compatible. And what’s with the specifications? It would be needed to add the registered features to the CSS specification, wouldn’t it? So I suppose, that browsers and specifications are supporting those OT layout features, that are actually registered, in five years or later.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Té. I have Firefox 4 beta installed. But I would prefer, if I would be allowed, to split a font into parts and create CSS classes as replacement for the layout features. But it is forbidden by the license. Maybe I am asking Bitstream, if they allow it. If they don’t allow it, I will not use Charter. Another advantage would be, that I could remove those characters from the font, that I don’t use. By the way, Charter Standard is more expensive than Charter Pro. And in contradiction to Charter Pro, some of the styles are available in packages only. However, Charter Standard looks bolder than Charter Pro on Windows because of the hinting. Even if I could license the single styles of Charter Standard, I would not do that because of the hinting.</div>

FWIW - I've thought about it, and this would be my preference, too. This way, I could get some things happening across the board in browsers today, not ten years from now.

I want. I want. I want.
Given your wishlist you better stick to Georgia. Well hinted including for the most problematic platforms (there is little chance that present or upcoming webfonts get close to its on-screen readability at text sizes since nobody or just a few may be able to invest what Microsoft possibly invested in their core fonts). And available on about every computer. Caps are small already so all-caps words won't stand out too much. If you think they do, set up an all-caps style with a slightly smaller font size.

<cite>Additionally I try to create websites, that are backwards compatible.</cite>

Making backward-compatible websites <em>and</em> using downloadable fonts? It seems that if there is no problem you're happy to create one. At least.</div>

Georgia would be in the second place of my font stack. And with regard to backwards compatibility your argument is not valid, because in case of the layout features there is a solution (font splitting), while there is no solution in case of font embedding. OT layout rules are even not compatible to the actual browser generation. In other words: If I would use those CSS rules, my website would be compatible to the most used browsers in a few years without backwards compatibility. If I split the fonts, my website is compatible to the actual browser generation and in five years it will be backwards compatible. By the way you seem to forget, that web pages can be printed. And I have a few texts, that are intended to become printed. So I am not interested in fake small caps. And except from that I don’t want to use Charter, because it looks nicer, but because it is more legible than Georgia in my opinion. Charter Pro really looks excellent. I simply will ask Bitstream, if they allow the splitting. And if they don’t allow it, they simply don’t get my money. I assume, that the foundries, which sell web fonts via Myfonts, want money. The “I want, I want, I want” is not on my side only. I only want a reward for my money. The reward is, that I am allowed to invest my time and my energy in splitting the font by myself. I even don’t expect, that they do that for me. If they want to have just a restrictive EULAA. Bad luck, but not only for me.</div>

When will you stop with the "if only" agenda and take the world as it is?
You write like DirectWrite is a magic bullet that's going to end the need for hinting TT fonts. It don't, it won't. You make a reference to fonts with "just a little hinting" - isn't that sort of like "just a little pregnant". (And with the new Swiss laws regarding consensual incest, this can get pretty complicated. Ask Arno, he's the one who told me about it.)
And BTW - Cleartype is on by default in IE7 and 8. And take it from an old network engineer/desktop support guy: users never, ever change their fracking defaults.
Also, you write like desktop browsers are the be-all, end-all. They're not. iPad is big. iPhone is big. Mobile browsing in general is big, big, big, and growing by leaps and bounds.
The Chrome OS comes out this year. I expect that Ubuntu will make some strides, too.
You did get one thing right, though: the problem is as much about font weight as hinting.

And why are the fonts on Webtype so boring?

Yes, yes, I want, I want, I want. And guess what? I'm gettin' it.

Merry Xmas!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ralf.
Just for the analytical exercise:

<em>How many customers are there, that can split a modern webfont with OT features and preserve TrueType hinting, keep OT features and kerning working? 1 out of 50? And the other 49 will mess it up, ending up with bad looking or malfunctioning fonts and they or the viewers of their websites will blame the type foundry.

Typekit (among others) - and by their own admission, really - delivers all the 'bad looking and malfunctioning fonts' you could possibly want now, today. So what?
You talk of "the foundries" as a monolithic entity. Has there been a grand merger I'm unaware of? Some foundries will do whatever they think a customer is willing to pay for.

<em>If features such as small caps should work in a webfont, they should 1) be already in the font as OT feature (wont work now) or 2) be provided by the foundry as separate font (as FSI does it) or 3) be generated on the fly by the vendor's system (as Typotheque's webfont service does it)</em>

Well, okay. All Arno is asking for is option number 2, so where's the disagreement?

<em>You purchase a license to use a font. Foundries don't sell toolbox of glyphs and codes so you can build whatever you want from it.</em>
Some will.

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">It’s the fear, that the user manipulates the typeface. I can partly understand that fear. But I don’t want to change the typeface, but the font. And I think, a solution could be, that the license allows to change anything in the font, if the manipulator keeps the original font names, but adds the suffix <em>mod</em> or <em>modified</em>. And the user should add the information to the copyright sections of the font, that the font was manipulated by the licensee with the consent of the foundry, but that it is still the property of the foundry. And additionally this information should be stored in the CSS and, for the case, that the font is not base64-encoded, in an info-file, that is stored in the same directory as the fonts.

There is another thing, which I would like to change in case of some fonts (not in Charter) and that are the metrics. If I enlarge the letter-spacing with CSS by one pixel the letter-spacing is already too wide in most cases. But if I enlarge it by fractions of one pixel, it becomes uneven. This problem could be solved, if the user would be allowed to enlarge the letter-spacing directly in the font.

With regard to the design of the glyphs, I would be more careful, but I could imagine, that it would be useful to provide an extra CSS especially for print, in which a slightly enbolded version of Charter is embedded. I think, the only point, that is really important is, that, if the font is pirated from the website of the licensee by a potential other licensee, this potential licensee knows, that the font is not that, what he would get from Bitstream/Myfonts. Why? Because either the modified version of the font is better than the original. In this case the new licensee would be disapointed, if he licenses the original. Or the modified version is worse. In this case he may decide, not to license the font.

For the moment I only can say, that I have not seen one website, that was improved by a webfont for body text. Example: "http://www.thomasphinney.com/". What the hell has he done there? The website does not profit from the embedded font. It is just the other way around. Except from the fact, that the font is ugly, it is not well hinted.

By the way, there is a thing, that is really absurd with regard to system fonts. It is absurd, that licensees of Windows are not allowed to embed system fonts in their websites. It is absurd, because websites are even displayed in system fonts on the screens of the big majority of all visitors, if they are in the font stack, but not embedded. And it is absurd, because a license for a system font probably costs as much or more as the whole operating system. And it is unfair, because those restrictions will let many thousands of people walk right into the trap of charged cease-and-desist orders. When you decided to become a type designer, one motivation probably was, to make the world more beautiful. In case of the internet the world is still ugly. There are so many websites overloaded with ornaments. They look like diversionary manoeuvres from technical hurdles like low screen resolutions. The ornaments are needed, because the text cannot catch the attention. And in the web empty spaces blend much more than in a book. In case of books I never have the feeling, that they look the same, although objectively they often look more the same than websites. Now I have lost my train of thought. Maybe this: If you only provide display fonts, that work with regard to the quality, in which they are displayed on screen, you just provide new diversionary tactics.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Arno: <em>Even if we will see browsers, that support OT layout features in the next years, I doubt, that they better work with regard to that, than Office for example.</em>

The CSS3 font spec support for layout features is significantly more advanced than that provided in most word processing apps and in some respects even more advanced than that in InDesign. The nightly test builds of FireFox 4.0 already provide support for more OTL features than InDesign, both through higher level feature functions defined in CSS and through direct access to font-specific features (meaning that even custom layout features can be accessed).

If you download and install the <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">FireFox 4.0 nightly build</a>, you can see some of the Character Variant features, not supported in InDesign, at work in this <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~jdaggett/tests/byzantinecoin.html">example of Byzantine seal transcription</a> (ignore the fact that this lead seal is labelled as a coin; I'll ask John Daggett to fix that). If you look at the source code for this example, you will see both the Mozilla-specific test code and, commented, the proposed standard CSS3 code that will eventually replace it. [Note the variant forms of some letters, including two different forms of N and U, and the discretionary ligation of the Greek letters ΚΑΙ in their S-shaped sigil form.]

<cite>I was just reading your article and your conclusions and even some facts are wrong.</cite>

You must have read another text. There was one factual error indeed but you didn't even notice it. Mr Berlow did. A few remarks:

<cite>You make a reference to fonts with "just a little hinting"</cite>

The notion "just a little hinting" refers to the kind of hinting found in webfonts by FSI and others. It is "just a little hinting" in comparison to the hinting found in Microsoft's core fonts. No need for sophistery.

<cite>And BTW - Cleartype is on by default in IE7 and 8.</cite>

Had you read my text you would have noticed that this is core part of my argument: IE 7-9 and FF 4 are doing it already. And it would be helpful if the makers of only three other browsers followed this approach with future Windows-versions of their browsers.

<cite>Also, you write like desktop browsers are the be-all, end-all. [...] Mobile browsing in general is big, big, big, and growing by leaps and bounds.</cite>

<a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_vs_desktop-ww-monthly-200901-201011" target="_blank">Don't you think that</a> <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=0" target="_blank">you are exaggerating more than just a bit?</a> Also the question is not: desktop or mobile? but: what operating system, rasterizer, browser?
With or without your kind permission, I prefer to address one issue after the other, not all at once. My note was about Windows and browsers running on Windows. No OSX (except for a quick comparison). No Unix/Linux.</div>

Wonderful. Truly. And that bolsters the feeling I've had for quite awhile that browsers will not only be the predominant screen reading app as they are today, but also the predominant Print publishing app not too long in the future.
Kudos to Daggett, Kew, and Co. for stepping up.
The problem is that they are alone in this, and it will be many years before all the kinks get ironed out and the other UA's get on board. (And the learning curve will be a bitch.)
But at least there will be a working model and running code.

Thx for the update.

@arno
The body text on Thomas Phinney's blog is quite nice.
And INFG.
(It's Not Fracking Georgia)
It sets the overall look of the blog apart from others. I mean, the effect might be subliminal to a large degree, but very much felt by the reader. It sets a tone.
The system fonts are homogenized Diet Coke.

		<div class="commentbody">On the website <a href="http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Font-HOWTO/fonts.html">Linux Online</a> you can download the Windows Core fonts (“official distribution of these fonts for Linux” / package contains [naturally] Georgia) for free. There are even Windows Vista fonts contained in the archive, that you can download there (Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Consolas, Constantia, Corbel).

On <a href="http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/georgia-family.aspx"> the website of Ascender Fonts</a> you can license the Georgia family (for example) for 110 Dollar.

Except from that, that Microsoft has spread out the Core fonts itself (Correct English? itself?). It would be absurd, if it would not be allowed to embed the Core fonts, if they are still available for free.

And with regard to the look of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/charter-bt-pro/roman/gallery.html">Charter Pro</a> I seem to be wrong. My test platform was XP / Firefox 3.6. There it looks very good. But on most of the other combinations of OS/browser it does not. And I cannot understand, why someone can be in the opinion, that fonts look better on the MAC. So I don’t know anymore, if Charter Pro would be really a good investment. But I dislike Georgia. On XP/Firefox it looks too bold and I never felt, that it is well legible. I think, I would go with Verdana, but I have some own poems and short stories and technical tutorials. I would like to use the same font for both, but Verdana is inappropriate for the poems and the short stories. I am in search for a neutral serif font, that harmonies as much as possible with all of my texts. And it should look good on all platforms. Seems to be, that I have to wait another ten years.</div>

Do you really need me for pointing you to people, that possibly violate Microsoft’s copyrights? Just be happy, that Linux users are interested in Microsoft products. I mean, all you had to do is searching with Bin… – with Google. With a simple search I find round about 5000 unprotected directories, in which Calibri is stored. Not to talk about forums with links to file hosters. The link is in my previous post (Linux Online / paragraph 4.3 / tar archive). Do I interpret you correctly, that I would be allowed to embedd the Windows Core fonts in my website without an extra license? Otherwise you would not have explicitly asked for a pointer to the Vista fonts, right? And <em>if yes</em>, wouldn’t you say, that it is daylight robbery, if Ascenderfonts sells webfont licenses for the core fonts? :-)</div>

Not sure if anybody outside of Brooklyn, NY would get as much of a kick out of it as me, though.

Does Ascender (oops, Monotype) do the right thing when it sells the Droid fonts - claiming they've added glyphs but don't say which - for hundreds of dollars to some sucker who gets taken in by the Google Android connection and doesn't know that those fonts are open source and available elsewhere for free? And that using the Droid name for that purpose flies right in the face of the Apache license under which the fonts were released?

Android is Open Source according to praegnanz.de. This does not necessarily mean, that it is legal to extract the fonts, as far as I know.

Nevertheless Karsten may be right with regard to Droid, if the font, that Ascender fonts provides, contains extended character sets. I am more bothered because of the license for Georgia and other core fonts, that Ascender sells.

The Droid, which you can download there, seems to be the Pro version. At least it contains 894 glyphs. Naturally there are many people, that are going to use it without an extra license from Ascender Fonts. The reality creates a fait accompli. I doubt, that Ascender Fonts had any chance with a lawsuit in Germany. In the end the masses impose consuetudinary law. Never look a gift horse in the mouth. Droid was a gift. And it would be too much expected, that the users check, if it is still is a gift. In case of Charter it may be slightly different, but I assume, that even in Case of Charter the foundry had bad chances in a German court, if a user embeds Charter Pro. The main difference is, that Charter never was officially available as free webfont. Think about, before you make a gift to the web community.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Re: Droid: Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm of the old-school hucksterish mentality. If some sucker is willing to cough up the bucks without doing the research, that's too bad for them. As an old boss of mine used to say about just about everything: "F--ck 'em if they can't take a joke."
Do I really care? No. I'm juss sayin'...

Looking at it in the shoes of a potential customer, I'm left wondering what the heck I'm getting in the Droid Pro version that I don't get in the no-pay.
Seems like Karsten - you had to do some digging - to figure it out. If indeed you have.
I mean, c'mon, if you're competing with free, spell out to the customer why they should pay. (But of course that means admitting most of it can be had for free.)

And on the Webtype site, I'm also left wondering if they're delivering that whole humongous font to my web page. I mean, if I pick two weights, what is it - a 600 kb download?

<em>"Finkonomics: all products with the same name must always be the same price and contents for all customers for all time, everywhere."</em>

Well, you're putting words in my mouth but they taste good. Upon reflection it does make things simple and honest beyond all criticism and doubt doesn't it?

My hypocrisy alarm is set to a low threshold these days and I just don't want to hear anything resembling a sermon, that's all.

If you're Microsoft you can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/technology/07piracy.html">spend a couple of hundred million dollars a year on a private police force</a> to enforce your copyrights and trademarks.
Everybody else is just sucking wind.
There is one law for the Lion and one for the Ox.
It all boils down to who can afford the legal fees, the rest is masturbation.

Yesterday I was sent, privately, a comparison of open-source font licenses - quite well put together and from someone I respect - that just left me shaking my head.
Something has gone fundamentally wrong.

Licenses are private legislation, that's what they are. And if that's what we're going to rely on, it's not unreasonable to ask that it be clear what the law being made by that private legislation is.
But it keeps on getting more and more incomprehendable and divorced from reality. To the point of meaninglessness.

<cite>So anyway, Arno. What do you need for your webfont? A Charter that looks good onscreen? Along with a small caps version to ride along?</cite>

I did not test all webfonts for body text, but Charter is extremely well legible on my system (XP with activated and tuned Cleartype). But when I saw it on Myfonts, it does not look good on Windows Vista and 7. I wonder, why. Maybe because I am using the Cleartype value 1.5 and Myfonts a bigger value. It has not necessarily to be Charter, but it shall be more legible than Georgia. My priority is the legibility, but not the specialty of my website with regard to the font. The user may not recognize the beauty of the font, that I use. If the typeface would be a bit more beautiful (I would not call Charter beautiful, but simply neutral), it would be better, but I assume, that beauty can be a hurdle for the rasterizer (if there are more details for example).

I want to use the same font family for the whole website and I have very different kinds of own texts, poems, short stories, blog articles. (I become more and more political and there are certain themes like population growth, prenatal diagnostics, religious illusions and so on, about which I want to write in my own blog.) And I have technical tutorials like the translation of David Lemon’s PostScript hinting tutorial to German (I spend round about fifty hours with translating and creating the images). I still have to ask David Lemon, if he allows, that I publish the translation on my website. Otherwise I will keep it private or write my own PS hinting tutorial. If I find the time, I am going to study Adam’s TrueType hinting tutorial (maybe in a year), translate it to German and publish it likewise, if he allows. Why? Because nobody else seems to do it and if I want to understand this complex technical stuff, I need a clean translation for myself. So I am doing it primary for myself, but it is too good for not publishing it. Naturally in both cases with the names of the authors. But I want to publish it on my website, because my personal contribution was big. I could write my own PS-hinting-tutorial, but David has a very good writing style and although you probably see, that my English is not good, when you read comments like this one, the translation is very successful in my opinion.

But I am still in the beginning. I had a website, but I gave up a few years ago, because I felt too much pressed because of the technical limits; no CSS3, no font-embedding, no hyphenation for example. Fortunately these limits have partly gone. But meanwhile I have forgotten much. So I will need a while, probably at least a few months, until it is online. I hope, I am not getting bogged down in details. I want to try it with Wordpress first, but with an own template. I have ordered a web package a few days ago. (I can have as much MySQL databases, as six Gigabyte webspace allow. And the package is not expensive.)

On the other side I want not spread out my private data. I cannot exclude, that it ends up with a private website. I love and hate the word wide web and computers in equal measure.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry to join the thread so late... Regarding the questions about the Droid fonts, as readers here know the Droid fonts were created by Monotype Imaging's Ascender team for the Android platform. The main differences between the "Pro" versions we created and the original are additional OpenType features including old style figures and some ligatures. As was pointed out, these have extensive characters sets including support for the WGL Pan-European character set. We produced these in both OTF and TTF formats (you won't find OpenType CFF versions in the open source version).

Like any font sold on AscenderFonts.com, it comes with our customer service and tech support, which we are quite proud of. 

Cheers!

These words don't taste good. Too sour.

Have you read the Apache license? I thought everybody was supposed to spend at least an hour a day reading licenses?

If that's the license under which Monotype/Ascender acquired the font, they are breaking the license. Period. Pure and simple. Cut and dried.
Post it right here on this thread and let's take a look at it since you seem to think it has some importance.

We're talking about slapping the word "Pro" on something - without anything concrete to back up the difference between the "Regular", which is free and the supposed "Pro" which is costly. (Good pros usually are, unfortunately.)
And this is especially galling if the font was done in China for 33 cents a glyph.

And like I said, I don't mind the hucksterism. I'd buy a used car from Bill anytime.

So all in all, I don't know what you're talking about or to.

Toodles,

rich
