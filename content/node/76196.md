  \ We're in need of a printer that outputs text at acceptable resolutions, isn't
  going to break down on us and isn't going to cost a fortune.  Though it will primarily
  be used for printing generic office documents, I would like for it to be able to
  print out quality drafts and tests when needed.  I don't know much about the standing
  of laser printers in the current market or which brands to trust.  Most of the posts
  on the forum concerning the topic are outdated and reviews on the web are scattered
  about and from people who aren't concerned with the same things we are (ie text
  qualities, etc.)\r\n\r\nIf those of you on the forum feel like sharing your opinions
  and experiences please do.  It'd be greatly appreciated.  \r\n\r\nJust as an example:
  \ Would this be a suitable printer: SAMSUNG ML-2525W? (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16828112184)
  \ Is Samsung trustworthy?  Are all printers around $100 going to break down in a
  few months?  Does it even matter which brand I choose?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKorey\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have a Brother HL-5250DN. While I get a lot of prints out of it, the resolution
    is completely terrible for proofing type.\r\n\r\nIf you do buy a cheaper laser
    printer, you will probably have the same issue. Plus, the added frustration that
    drum and toner kits cost more than a new printer. Lame.\r\n\r\nI am also curious
    about other reviews for type-specific use."

    various models before you buy - many refurbished lasers are not that old if you
    look around.

    been an incredible workhorse. Very cheep, and never a problem. They are even cheaper
    now and come with built in duplex capabilities. If I were to get a colour, I would
    start looking at Brother. Maybe 10 years ago I worked for a company in Toronto
    and they had (I think) a \u201CPhazer Tectronics 780,\u201D which I believe has
    since been bought out by Xerox. It was <strong>very</strong> good and <strong>extremely</strong>
    expensive. >$3,000 Canadian in 1998."

  body: "I second Bob's recommendation of HP network printers. I picked up a LaserJet
    5000n for $50 advertised on craigslist.\r\nThe upsides are that it handles 11x17,
    A3, and sheets slightly larger; it can also handle pretty heavy weight media when
    loaded manually; it does high-volume printing very well; its toner lasts a long
    time; after setting it up on the network, it's really simple to add the printer
    to other computers, particularly ones running OS X; for general graphic design
    proofing (usually with lots of greys on the page) the print quality is fine\u2014for
    lettering and type design it's great; it's pretty reliable. In four years I have
    never had a problem more complicated than a paper jam.\r\nDownsides: It's big
    and heavy; setting it up on the network is just slightly complicated, or not at
    all, depending on how the previous owner configured it. It took me 30 minutes
    (and you'll need to know a few particulars about how your own network is set up);
    Also, buying second-hand can be risky. I got lucky and found a machine that had
    hardly been used and its imaging and output were perfect. Particularly with these
    older models though you'll find some that have been mistreated, and often the
    result is repeating defects\u2014some of which disappear with a new toner cartridge,
    some don't. Just be sure to check its test page output carefully before buying.\r\n\r\nI
    also second Christopher on Phaser's color. It's the best color laser output I've
    seen. The place I was working that had it did have to call in professionals occasionally
    to recalibrate it and replace parts a few times over the course of the 9 months
    I was there."

  body: Some of the better models in the Xerox Phaser line can be great for a graphic
    design office; wonderful color rendition, can print 11 x 17, etc.. But pricey,
    though. I think the one I use cost over $4,000. And it weighs a ton.  But they
    have cheaper models in the Phaser line too.

  body: "Let me add a second question to this thread: does anyone have different type
    results with original and recharged toner?\r\n\r\nWith my HPs (LaserJet 4P, LaserJet
    2100m and ColorJet 2605dn) original toner produces type bolder than I expected.
    It's clearly more tinted than I see on screen, although contour quality is excellent.
    But with recharged toner cartridges these same printers produces lighter, less
    tinted texts. Actually, type printed with recharged toner is more near to off-set
    print result, but contour quality is not so perfect.\r\n\r\nWas this an issue
    to you? Which kind of test must be considered more reliable to show how my font
    will play at commercial prints?\r\n\r\nAbout color printing, I worked intensively
    with a Tektronix about ten years ago, just before the company was purchased by
    Xerox. Although expensive, Tektronix color results were fantastic. Pure B&W text
    were not so good, always darker than it would be. Phaser printers and also its
    print results suffered a lot with humidity and heat climate conditions. In other
    hand, HP ColorJet 2605 I use now produces rather good results for color text and
    graphics, but has a poor, swashed output with photos. It's much cheaper and hardly
    affected by humidity."

  body: "I have an HP color laserjet, which is a fine workhorse printer, but as Freiberger
    says, if you're proofing type, it comes out bolder than you expect. I don't think
    this is a function of the toner but rather of the Postscript emulation that the
    HP print driver uses. Using recharged toner cartridges probably does adjust for
    this gain.\r\n\r\nBut this summer I got a Xerox Phaser monochrome printer with
    true Postscript. Everything comes out a lot sharper and without the HP bloat.
    \r\n\r\nWhat I concluded: If your target output device is a true Postscript printer
    (e.g. professional offset printing), then it's worth having a true Postscript
    printer to proof with. I am not sponsored by Xerox, but it's the only true Postscript
    printer I found at a reasonable price. "

    its low quality (at least for my printer).'
