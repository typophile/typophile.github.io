  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The native Mayas lived in the Mesoamerican region (Central America) from around 2500 BC. Their intelligent and beautiful written language is quite unknown to the western world, and even Central Americans, because it remained undeciphered for centuries. My work proposes a re-interpretation of the original Maya hieroglyphs with the aim of applying them to contemporary visual communications by designing new symbols and pictograms that can be used in sign design across archaeological and public sites in Central America. The ‘New Maya Hieroglyphs’ enhance the site users visiting and learning experience and, can act as regenerative agents for Central America’s graphic culture.</p>
<p>Joya de Cerén archaeological site in El Salvador, which was my case study, is about common citizen’s way of living, about their eating habits, social relations, architecture and agriculture. Unfortunately, the Maya written language was not democratic so the ‘New Maya Hieroglyphs’ act as an accessible bridge between the content and the general audience; they can surpass any language barrier, literacy disadvantage or disability through their exposure in public locations or through their appreciation as an art form.</p>
<p>This is a modest attempt to bring value to the Maya cultural identity and a celebration of Mesoamerica’s indigenous roots. A revival of the Maya language becomes a viable path for developing cultural symbols that inspire future generations and bring new life to the sacred stones.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t quite understand how you plan to use them.</p>
<p>Would this form a sort of vocabulary by itself. Where each image becomes almost a pictogram. Or would you use it more as a kind of embellishment?</p>
<p>Also, what was the  Maya written language like? Is it a script that still survives?</p>

<p>Well they are indeed fascinating, the more I learn the more I want to swap my Mac for a 4x4 and live in an archaeological site for the rest of my life! I will start design work on at least one archaeological site in Copán, Honduras, Mesoamerica which was the greatest artistic Maya area across the region – so my dream is just starting to come true. The main Copán park holds the largest written book in the world with 2500 beautifully carved glyphs reading up-wards on the 63-step staircase (see panoramic pic area to the right covered by green plastic). Just as a curious note, if you can find hieroglyphic content in a site it usually means that it was highly developed and its governor (king) had great regional power – the power of knowledge!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>writingdesigning,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments. This was my MA project at Central Saint Martins. After research on the original glyphs (around 30 of them of more than 2000 deciphered), in which I classified (see first figure below), vectorised, and colour-coded them (see second figure below). I then used this study to generate two types of new glyphs – a) logograms specifically for story-telling and, b) wayfinding pictograms. The original glyphs are both syllabographic and logographic i.e. the symbols can mean a syllable or mean what they graphically represent. A glyph (short for hieroglyph) is usually composed of sub-glyphs. In my work I am just proposing logograms so, what you see is what you get. They were formed by redesigning the originals for better legibility and combining sub-glyphs to form new meanings that communicate contemporary ideas or the story of an archaeological site (like in this case). Hope I have made myself clear, maybe I make it more complicated than it is!</p>
<p>The applicability is endless. Like I said above I will be working in Copán in a unique Maya archaeological site that will let a niche audience (not the usual tourist) see how archaeologists excavate and research the site. The information will be published through signage as soon as it becomes available. My project falls well into place as my final objective is a) to make the visiting of a public site a learning and interactive experience through a beautiful yet content-relevant designed information system, and b) to let visual communicators become a part of multi-disciplinary teams where you&rsquo;ve usually had engineers or architects playing that role. The government and archaeologists over there are quite open to my ideas which is a great start. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes though.</p>
<p>If you are interested, the essay will be published on the ISTD&rsquo;s TypoGraphic 66. The books are just limited edition (self-printed and bound) but it would be nice to publish the guide-book that tells the case study archaeological site&rsquo;s story and explains how I designed/ composed each &lsquo;New Maya Glyph&rsquo;. If anybody has any ideas on where to find an apt publisher I would be grateful although maybe it&rsquo;s too ambitious and nobody will buy it!</p>

<p>No you do not, at all. You explain it very eloquently. In fact your passion for the topic is so evident.  Which is probably why people from other disciplines - architects, engineers, archaeologists, have been so receptive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it would be nice to publish the guide-book..&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t you have something like a heritage conservation body out there which would be interested? Something similar to the National Trust in the UK, or INTACH in India?</p>
<p>I suppose it would be really nice if you could in some way publish it in a form where it engages local children.</p>
<p>Thanks and great luck ahead!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here are some spreads of my new &lsquo;New Maya Language&rsquo; book.  This book compiles my previous works in a simple easy to understand format.</p>
<p>The New Maya Language is a redesign and recomposition of certain original Maya script ideographs that communicate concepts and even sentences.  It parallels the principle of the Chinese-concept script where primary root or Lego-like pictographs can be combined to generate compound pictographs that signify a more complex idea (Chizlet C.).</p>
<p>The first ‘Maya Language’ section of the book introduces a basic understanding of how the Maya writing system works.</p>
<p>The second section tells the story &lsquo;Joya de Cerén&rsquo; UNESCO World Heritage Archaeological Site in El Salvador in Central America through 23 New Maya Language glyphs.  Spread by spread the reader is introduced to each one of them and how they were formulated. For example, ‘Stone’ + ‘Fire’ combined equal the ‘Lavastone’ New Maya Language ideograph.</p>
<p>Finally, the ‘Applications’ section shows real life examples of how the New Maya Language can be taken forward to other forms of visual communication, such as brand identities.
