  Purnell Parnters</a>. I have to admit I\u2019m certainly surprised with the direction
  they\u2019ve taken with this. Melbourne is a very modern, colourful and culturally
  vibrant city\u2026 and they\u2019ve gone with cool tones of blue and smooshed Helvetica
  bold?\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/state-has-new-designs-on-the-world/2006/03/09/1141701635152.html\">The
  Age</a>:\r\n<cite>\u201CFrom market research, Mr Cato said visitors to Melbourne
  often discovered there were more dimensions to the city than they had anticipated.\r\n\"So
  we're kind of saying it's a bit like an onion \u2014 each time you peel back a layer
  there's a better bit underneath.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThe \"onion\" analogy rings true.
  Melbourne is indeed a multi-layered city, you discover something new and exciting
  everyday, but is the turning pages design effective at communicating this? I think
  blue is certainly a surprising choice. Is it vibrant enough for Melbourne?\r\n\r\nAt
  present, I am not sure what to make of this. Admittedly, my inital thoughts about
  this new logo weren't very positive (10-20 minutes of non-stop ranting) and I understand
  that \"rebranding\" a city is possibly one of the toughest briefs a design firm
  can take on, which is why I've invited you all to please share your thoughts about
  this. :)\r\n\r\n<strong>What do you think?</strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thatsmebourne2.gif]\r\nOld

    have four letters on the right side opposed to three. "

  body: "Here we go again. Another typophile thread grumbling about a logo redesign.\r\n\r\nThe
    previous Me!bourne logo wasn't much of a logo, expressing barely a scintilla of
    a design idea. The split color treatment and the exclamation substituting the
    \"l\" were old hat at the time---today they're cliched and embarrassing. The \"that's
    me!\" part is plain corny. (wretch, gag etc) And the purple + white verges on
    a gothic theme that does not fit Melbourne at all.\r\n\r\nThe new logo with its
    tangible idea beats the pants off the old one. The blue colors aren't neccessarily
    downbeat or subdued. Dark blue or the business suit navy would have been conservative
    and dull. \r\n\r\nThe blues start with a light powder blue (sky blue) and go up
    to cyan (ocean color). Well, oceans are warm on bright sunny days aren't they?
    Not always, but they certainly <em>look</em> warm and inviting. The ocean in travel
    ads for an island paradise or luxury cabin cruise is always a happy inviting cyan/blue.\r\n\r\nAside
    from the fanned-out pages, the multiple hues  are, I guess, meant to represent
    Melbourne's multi-faceted, multi-cultural, diverse nature. I have lived in Melbourne
    most of my life and its always been a blue kind of city to me. We're known for
    watery elements like our four-seasons-in-one-day weather and Port Philip Bay.\r\n\r\nHelvetica
    regular is a face of questionable aesthetic merit; feeble and spindly, graceless,
    sickly and awkward-looking. It looks like doggie eggs in text settings, according
    to Paul Rand. I'm trying to get the National Gallery of Victoria to stop using
    tightly-spaced Helvetica regular for its exhibition typography because its so
    hard to read, the leading so tight effort is required to avoid re-reading lines
    unintentionally.\r\n\r\nHelvetica bold however, is nowhere near as objectionable
    as the regular. Helv regular gives the bold a shoddy reputation it does not deserve.
    Helv bold is a common choice for designs where trendier and more stylized sans
    serifs draw too much attention to themselves. That is, Helv bold is very useful
    for certain kinds of work. In bold guise it loses much of its ugliness and becomes
    generic, making it useful. Its usefulness depends on the job; just because a designer
    uses Helvetica (bold or reg) doesn't neccessarily make it a bad choice, or make
    Helvetica bold an inherently bad font.\r\n\r\nHelv, in any weight, can be a bad
    choice when you have a D or B. Helv's D and B are ungainly by their excessive
    width, eg: the NBC TODAY show logo.\r\n\r\nHo boye, lucky MELBOURNE doesn't have
    a D in it. I wouldn't like this logo if it had a big fat Helvetica D :^) But it
    does have a B and R. The designers got around that by condensing the glyphs in
    the middle, or possibly they used Helv bold condensed, or modified the standard
    bold, or designed custom glyphs for the middle letters, or the whole thing.\r\n\r\nDoes
    the O look like a Helvetica O? Not really. More like Din. Hey it could be---look
    at those straight sides :^)\r\n\r\nGeoff, I did not find Helvetica mentioned anywhere
    in the source article. Not saying it isn't Helv, but I've got my doubts from looking
    at the O.\r\n\r\nOther than the B, there aren't enuff letters here to tie the
    glyphs unmistakably to Helvetica. It could easily be a nice URW++ grotesk. The
    R with the curled leg is a generic design dating back to Akzidenz Gotesk and the
    whole grotesk sans tradition. The other caps here could be generic or grotesk---there
    wouldn't be much difference from Helv bold.\r\n\r\n<em>smooshed</em>\r\n\r\nQue?
    The letters are perspectivized. Is there something wrong with that? It looks artfully
    done. At least they haven't been mercilessly squished or squooshed. It seems typophiles
    are against any kind of manipulation or distortion of letters---including treatments
    that serve extra-dimensional aspects of a logo design, even when artfully executed.\r\n\r\n<em>In
    general I like the new one, but I don\u2019t like the typography. Is it only me
    who thinks the \u201CN\u201D is too big (and the the right stem is too bold)?
    If one do something like that, you have to re-balance these details, which did
    not happen I guess.</em>\r\n\r\nTechnically the N <em>appears</em> oversized (may
    be an optical illusion). The right stem only looks too heavy because the left
    stem is lightened by the perspective distortion and overlapping color patch. But
    in practical use the guy in the street does not notice these things. You can have
    technically perfect typography and design if you want it, but how relevant and
    neccessary is that degree of perfection?\r\n\r\nWhy does it have to be perfect?
    Why <em>can't</em> it be a little bit imperfect? Is imperfection, in an otherwise
    near-as-dagnammit perfect creation, really a bad thing? Doesn't the quirk make
    it more interesting?\r\n\r\nArt it is. Design it is. \"information architecture\"
    or computer programming it is not.\r\n\r\nThe designers could have compensated
    for the optical illusions, but they didn't---it isn't important enuff, and even
    it were corrected most people would not know the difference.\r\n\r\nLike it matters.\r\n\r\nFrom
    the source page:\r\n\r\n\"Designer Vince Frost, of Frost Design in Sydney, disagreed.
    \"I just think this looks incredibly weak,\" he said. \"For me it's really lacking
    in an idea. It doesn't feel modern or fresh and that's the kind of city Melbourne
    is.\"\r\n\r\nI think he's missing the subtlety of this design. There is a soild
    idea there, even if it is not as articulately expressed as it could have been.\r\n\r\nj

    the tones of colours aren't working for me and the perspective (from the image
