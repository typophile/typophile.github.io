body: For those of you who have read my posts over the past few days and weeks, it&#39;s
  obvious to see my concern and frustration with the current state of font development
  software. I want an application that does technically what Font Lab can do but I
  want it to work like Fontographer. <BR> <BR>So, let&#39;s redesign the Font Lab
  GUI and submit them to Yuri for potential integration! <BR> <BR>There is no question
  that our cumulative talents lie in design, not programming and since this is a design
  problem, not a technical one, we are the only folks who can affect change at a larger
  level with regard to this problem. <BR> <BR>I think a picture is worth a thousand
  words and will speak volumes to the Font Lab development team to know that this
  is a genuine concern for many of us on the boards designing type in our daily professional
  lives and it must be addressed. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s what I propose . . . . <BR>
  <BR>Let&#39;s start with the current version of Font Lab - For those of you who
  don&#39;t own a copy, download the demo and work from that. <BR> <BR>Then from those
  elements, modify the GUI to something you&#39;d like to see it become. Complete
  with shortcut buttons, icons, whatever you feel will get the point across and post
  it here as a gif for us to see and critique.  <BR> <BR>We&#39;ll critique the GUI&#39;s
  as we do typefaces and modify it accordingly till we arrive at a collaboratively
  designed GUI we all feel we&#39;d like Font Lab to become or include in its options
  and present it to Yuri to integrate. <BR> <BR>If you think of it, without direction,
  Font Lab may never create a GUI that we feel is adequate for our purposes especially
  since they come from a programming background instead of a design background and
  all wish lists aside, we need to start from the current foundation of what we know
  Font Lab has in it now. <BR> <BR>Let the posting begin! <BR>Stuart :D

  body: 'I&#39;m all for providing Yuri &amp; Co. with feedback on interface and usability
    issues, but to propose a complete overall of FontLab seems to be asking too much
    at this point. I can only speak for myself, but I will say: <BR> <BR>I was a die-hard
    Fog4 user for ages. Bought FL3 to get into TT deltas and never used it much. Finally
    got FL4.5 the moment it came out, and have never looked back. <BR> <BR>Even coming
    from the programming side of things, the FontLab people have done an exceptional
    job of making things brilliant and easy. Many forehead-slapping moments of &#34;How
    could I have ever lived without this?&#34; Other things were confusing to me at
    first, but now I&#39;m glad they&#39;re there. Sure, it needs some polish, but
    that will come. <BR> <BR>I would be curious to see what people come up with as
    their own ideas of how FL could evolve, but even as a paying customer, I feel
    more like thanking them profusely than demanding GUI adjustments to make the interface
    &#34;adequate&#34;, which I feel it far overshoots. Suggestions about interface
    and workflow might be best posted on the FontLab user forum &#40;<a href="http://groups.msn.com/FontLab"
    target="_blank">http://groups.msn.com/FontLab</a>&#41;. <BR> <BR>Just my opinion!

    <BR> <BR>Now, as for improving Fontographer, that&#39;s another story ... <BR>

  body: Hee, hee. I like it. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, I think what would be good is if
    somebody could create a modern font editor that would use all our favorite elements
    from old FOG, adding a few new ideas to make it even better. BUT, leave out all
    the production-oriented stuff &#40;hinting, advanced encoding, etc.&#41;. Instead,
    focus on the design and drawing stage &#40;and maybe spacing and kerning&#41;.
    It would save the fonts in some standard format which could be brought into FontLab
    for finishing. <BR> <BR>As it is, this is how many people are using FOG now. So
    basically, it would be a stripped down FOG which would run on modern OS&#39;s.
    An alternative to FL&#39;s inscrutible &#40;at least for some people&#41; tools.
    <BR> <BR>On the other hand, don&#39;t you think that the difficulty inherent in
    font creation tools tends to filter out all but the most determined souls? If
    it was much easier, anyone could do it, there would be untold numbers of fonts
    available--people could even give them away!--and we would all be put out of business
    &#40;he says only half seriously...&#41;.

  body: That&#39;s what the $99 tool they created was for :D . . . <BR> <BR>I would
    be a hypocrite if I continued to complain about a lousy interface and not at least
    make some effort to re-design it myself or influence a GUI update to the application.
    <BR> <BR>While I agree with Alan that FL is to be praised for their efforts in
    getting the application this far, I do feel if they are serious about their financial
    success they would be inclined to make &#34;minor&#34; GUI enhancements to get
    a larger audience to purchase their product. <BR> <BR>Again, I think Font Lab
    is 98% there already and to modify the GUI may be only a few days effort since
    so much of it has been already programmed. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d even be inclined to
    fly to Russia and sit over their shoulders to direct the effort - BUT since they&#39;re
    coming to town for Typecon, I can do it form here :D <BR> <BR>I think if we&#39;re
    talking about modifying the editor, there could be a nice opportunity to have
    different &#34;modes&#34; that one could toggle through for different tasks ala
    Drawing, Spacing, Kerning, and Hinting as well as a more integrated Font Generation
    suite. <BR> <BR>I still think it&#39;d be cool to have a quick method to add alternate
    glyphs to a font and a quick kern for those . . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D
