  newspapers who keep their designs traditional.\r\n\r\nBravo!  Well done, indeed!
  \ Don't you change your looks one bit!\r\nI love them just the way they are right
  now.\r\n\r\nTo all interested:  Consider Robert Slimbach's Kepler typefaces for
  \r\nyour newspaper, whether big or small.  I believe that Kepler's looks \r\nare
  perfect for newspaper design applications.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kepler
