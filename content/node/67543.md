    being shy isn't especially conducive to the highly-social needs of the design
    practitioner... Especially for freelance people. If it is indeed '...who you know',
    and  your pool of design contacts is a shallow one, then you really have to create
    a different gauge for how you measure success.\r\n\r\nPolite is sometimes interpreted
    as timid or a self-confidence issue by a client, teacher or employer, and unfortunately,
    it can make every piece of concept work you produce, a hard sell. \r\n"

    I have trouble talking on the phone or meeting other designers. Kinda freaks me
    out. If you're a designer and you've spoken to me it's a rare thing. When I go
    to Typecon I generally hang out in the back and keep to myself. If you've spoken
    to me at a Typecon it was probably the only conversation I had with someone at
    Typecon that year.\r\n\r\nWhen I do have a shop-talk kind of conversation with
    a designer I generally don't know what they're talking about. I don't know the
    names of many people who make fonts or the politics. I'm really just into the
    fonts themselves; I'm not so much into the back-story.\r\n\r\nI'm not normally
    like o shy; I think with non designers I'm totally fine. I used to be in the videogames
    business and I never felt weird about meeting other people in the profession.
    I wouldn't call myself a generally shy person, just with other designers.\r\n"

    Robert Schumann, Anton Bruckner, Franz Schubert and Pyotr Illich Tchaikovsky were
    shy &ndash;but definitely not boring. About the last named you can find the following
    piece of text on <a href=\"http://www.pianosociety.com/cms/index.php?section=51\">Piano
    Society</a>:\r\n\r\n[...] About this time Tchaikovsky started a relationship with
    a wealthy widow, Nadejda von Meck, who became his patron for the next fourteen
    years. She was forty-six and the mother of seven. She offered to subsidize Tchaikovsky
    with the proviso that they never meet. During their voluminous correspondence
    she wrote, \"...I fear your acquaintanceship. I prefer to think of you from afar,
    to hear you speak in your music and share your feelings through it.\" This of
    course was a perfect situation for the morbidly shy composer who wrote back, \"You
    are afraid you will fail to find in my personality all those qualities with which
    your idealizing imagination has endowed me. And in that you are quite right.\"
    When they once met face to face at a concert, not a word was spoken as they turned
    away in embarrassment. [...]\r\n\r\n"

    no different than for any other profession where individual practitioners may
    be required to participate in social situations.\r\nWhatever one's comfort level
    is in dealing with other people, one tries to find it.\r\n\r\nHaving said that,
    I must admit that I went into design, rather than art, because I didn't like the
    way that artists' privacy is compromised by their art. I believed that in design,
    one's work speaks for itself, not requiring other people to know anything about
    its maker's background or psychology in order for it to be effective, understood
    and appreciated.\r\n\r\nHowever, it didn't work out quite that way for me as a
    type designer, and self-promotion has become part of my business strategy, for
    various reasons. \r\n\r\nI have the greatest respect for those who manage to be

  body: "shy + youth = cute. shy + older = odd/eccentric. i would agree with tell
    who said 'I'm extremely shy until I get to know people. Then I'm pretty much unbearable.'
    i guess it has to do with initially a fear of rejection - wanting to be accepted
    by strangers and not wanting to be rejected by 'friends.' i suppose a lot of it
    just boils down to perceptions of ourselves and others. i think we live in a much
    more openly critical society made even more so by the anonymity of the internets
    and the freedom it brings to criticize without being known. but i think it also
    helps shy people find kindred spirits and makes them more open in the process.
    but i think even shy people make themselves functionally socialable especially
    when having to interview for a job or otherwise deal with the challenges of life.\r\n\r\nthe
    only place i really socialize with other designers is on the internet. even here
    i don't really post alot, so i guess that would equate to being shy i suppose.
    i don't make my living as a designer, but i have designed a few fonts and engaged
    in discussion about them with other designers (over at fontstruct.) perhaps, it's
    understood you mean professional designers vs. 'hobbyists' i suppose."

    the stereotypically shy-designer personality. I've questioned why I am in this
    industry with so many people who are \"shy\" or reserved. I have rarely been friends
    with shy people in general and it has been a source of disappointment and loneliness
    in the industry. My wife was shy as a child and young-adult and made the transition
    from shy to \"I don't care what people think of me anymore\". Had I met her in
    her shy state - I never wouldv'e even pursued her.\r\n\r\nI have learned from

    because I think that among those of us who are younger, most people who are confident
    talking about design, their work, etc. are insufferably self-important. That seems
    to change as people make their way through their thirties, though.\r\n\r\nIn Portland,
    anyone who calls himself an artist can open a show at a bar or coffeehouse, and
    anyone who calls himself a designer can find modest work with young people who
    call themselves entrepreneurs. There's a lot around here to offend the eyes, but
    I think some of these young, overinflated amateurs might have more potential for
    growth than those of us who submerge ourselves in our own hangups."

    \"safe\" ideas to clients, to avoid disagreements.\r\n\r\nI've read that Afred
    Hitchcock was quite shy and would go to great lengths to avoid one-on-one disagreements
    with anyone. You'd think that shyness would be a big disadvantage to a movie director,
    as that job requires interacting with many people, often in high-pressure situations,
    but he certainly pulled it off.\r\n\r\nI once heard actor Charlton Heston tell
    an interviewer that he was actually very shy. The interviewer said that Charton
    didn't seem shy.  Charlton's serious reply was that he handled shyness by doing
    interviews as if they were acting jobs -- he was acting like a non-shy version

  body: I don't think being shy is a problem for a designer when doing the work. I
    think it may become an issue when presenting the work or interacting with committees
    to sell or present the work. Too often a perceived sense of confidence in ones
    own work wins out over the actual work. The work SHOULD speak for itself but in
    an approval by committee situation, it is rarely enough. Committee members need
    to show their presence or even save the day for the bosses eyes so they may make
    comments for show rather than for real. It is harder for a shy person to redirect
    the group back to the logical path while allowing each viewer to "earn their keep".
    Good design should always triumph but sadly, good presentation is more often needed
    to show what is good about the design.
