  the situation:\r\n\r\nI bought, downloaded, and installed their NEW SANS, only to
  find that the bold does not actually show up in the font menu in InDesign though
  it is in the downloaded folder. So I called Monotype who informed me that they made
  the font so that it linked to the bold file and all I had to do was hit \"cmd+b\"
  to bold it. Basically, a force bold, but with an actual postscript file which it
  draws from so in effect a double negative, resulting in a true bold drawing from
  an actual post script. \r\n\r\nThe files are postsccript. They are not OTF.\r\n\r\nHELP!\r\n\r\nDoes
  someone else make NEWS SANS that has a complete working suitcase? I do have font
  lab here, though I am a bit of a novice at it, is there a way to seperate the postscript
  files called ATNewNumFou and ATNewNumFouBol so that when I add them, they are not
  linked and the Bold actually shows up?\r\n\r\n-Andrew"

    New Sans, and select Normal as the weight/style. Then use the \"Build Names\"
    buttons (both of them), and generate a new font IN A DIFFERENT FOLDER.\r\n\r\nOpen
    the bold version, name it New Sans, select Bold as the weight/style, build the
    names, then generate a new font.\r\n\r\nMOVE the old fonts out of your fonts folder
    and install the new ones...oughta work."
