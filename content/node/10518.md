  body: It looks like it&#39;s based on the italic of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bookman/medium-italic/testdrive.html?s=Hollywood&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">ITC Bookman</a>, or Bookman Old Style. The serifs have been flattened,
    but the basic letterforms, especially of the y and w are from the italic typeface.

  body: Thanks Mike. I checked out Bookman and it s a pretty close match. Funny enough
    that you point out the y and w - there are the letter shapes i fell in love with

    target="_blank">Century Bold Italic</a> would be closer in my opinion. Even better
    would be Century Bold Italic Condensed, but I can&#39;t seem to find it. The biggest
    difference is that the l&#39;s and d have non-cursive forms and the H is missing
    the inside serifs.

  body: Looks like a mix of &#40;slanted&#41; ITC Century Bold Condensed and ITC Century
    Bold Condensed Italic.  <BR>Eg the serifs of the roman and the y and w of the
    italic.
