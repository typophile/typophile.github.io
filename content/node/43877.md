    It's a big book but I belive there's no type specimens besides that particular
    section.\r\nI can't remember the name right now, but i'm sure you'll find it in
    there. Although the cover lettering it's a outlined version of it.\r\nI'll check
    that out later this evening.\r\n\r\n;)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    some</em> information at least and b) you could have bumped that thread instead
    of starting a new one. Nevermind. :-)\r\nHere\u2019s a sample that might help
    finding it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/area_5612.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/area-2_4573.png]"
