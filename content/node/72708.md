    to ask my usual trinity of questions:\r\n\r\n1. Where is the best espresso in
    Los Angeles to be had? Anywhere near the conference venue?\r\n\r\n2. What are
    the best bookshops? I see that the famous Heritage Bookshop has closed: alas,
    another pilgrimage site that didn't stick around long enough for me to visit.\r\n\r\n3.
    What are the best restaurants within striking distance of the hotel? Any local
    delicacies that are worth seeking out?"

    delicacies in LA are the ethnic cuisine. The Ethiopian food at [[http://www.messob.com/ethiopia.html|Messob]]
    is excellent. After the meal you have to get the traditional Ethiopian coffee.
    It's 3 miles from the Hyatt, which isn't quite striking distance, but you don't
    need to take a freeway to get there :)"

    I'm with you on avoiding Starsucks. You might try\r\nthe City Bean just up the

    There's also something\r\ncalled Edibles Coffee Shop around there that's highly
