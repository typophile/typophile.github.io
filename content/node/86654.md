  body: Are you talking about the <em> actual </em> size of your ascenders and descenders
    or about the values in the OS/2 and hhea tables? If the former, I wouldn't worry
    about it (though in general you'll want the sum of your ascenders and descenders
    to be less than your UPM size). As for the latter, you can allow FLS to calculate
    these values automatically and it will generally assign sensible values.

    the values for OS/2 and hhea as an image. So there is no need to panic right?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nM"

  body: You may find Karsten Luecke's overview of font metrics a very insightful read.
    His overview of naming conventions is likewise recommended reading. Both can be
    found [[http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm|here]].
