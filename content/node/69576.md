  it into a full display font. I haven't created a complete alphabet as yet, but I've
  attached a couple of examples incorporating the existing letterforms.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?\r\n\r\n"

    sure deserve to be fleshed out."

  body: "Thanks riccard0. The first draft of the logotype had even more exaggerated
    ball terminals but I had to tone it down because it was way over the top. I've
    considered increasing the contrast between thicks and thins. I've also had a few
    ideas for some interesting ligatures.\r\n\r\nI'll develop a few more letters and
    post the results.\r\n\r\nThanks."
