  wondered if you could ID.  The gallery owner says it&#39;s called &#34;Amphoral,&#34;
  but I can&#39;t seem to find any references to that.  Thanks! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67471.jpg"

  body: The font is Antique Roman from the Engravers 1 package at Monotype. It was
    called Amphora in a release by an &#39;off-brand&#39; software company &#40;NovelFonts,
    I think&#41;.

  body: I think I know what this is. Somebody took Computer Modern &#40;the most ubiquitous
    font from the METAFONT system&#41;, and tweaked the hell out of the parameters.
    The low x-height is suggestive of CM Dunhill, but compared with that font I can
    see the right serifs on &#39;hn&#39; halved, the &#39;t&#39; taller &#40;and with
    a less upright tail terminal&#41;, the &#39;e&#39; and &#39;s&#39; wider, and
    the serifs on &#39;CSs&#39; smaller. <BR> <BR>That said, there are some characteristics
    that I feel absolutely give this one away, including the ball on the &#39;r&#39;,
    and the hairline tail on the C from 6 o&#39;clock to 3 o&#39;clock.

  body: Hmm. It still looks to me like a CM derivative, but obviously Mike&#39;s ID
    is a close match. Maybe the ripoff font was designed using Metafont? If true,
    that in and of itself would be kind of interesting.

  body: Raph, <BR> <BR>The leg of the capital &#34;R&#34; is very distinctive.  I
    just bought the Solid Antique, and their &#34;R&#34; matches the one I saw in
    person &#40;not included in the sample above, obviously&#41;.  I don&#39;t know
    what CM&#39;s looks like.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67475.jpg"

  body: This face goes back to the 1920s. It was called Typo Roman, designed by Morris
    Fuller Benton for ATF. The light weight &#40;above&#41; was released by Intertype
    in 1939, according to McGrew.
