  you are a Graphic or Type Designer you may be interested in these actions I wrote
  for Adobe Illustrator.\r\n\r\nGraphic Designers will benefit from the ease of use
  of Old Stocks Actions. Complex effects can be effortlessly produced in record time.
  This offers the Graphic Designer a wide array of effects for their logos and layouts.\r\n\r\nType
  Designers- Type Designers can use Old Stock's Actions to add drop shadows and fills
  to their new or existing typefaces. Every Action is vectorized and separated for
  ease of use. Old Stock does all of the hard work for you!\r\n\r\nFor the Type Designer
  you can use the actions to create stackable versions of your fonts (Graphic Designers
  can use these for their logos). The sample below consists of 4 fonts. The base font,
  a solid drop shadow, diagonal line drop shadow and a fill all made using Old Stock.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/K_5636.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cover_5563.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample-1_5818.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample-2-good_4649.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample-3_6441.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample-4-reset_3488.png]\r\nThanks

    are the actions?'

    company took forever to update it for OS-X and many folks assumed the company
    was finished, but they eventually did update it."

  body: The updated version took so long and in the process they kept adding stuff
    the program just is not as interesting as it was. Sometimes less is more.

    Stock is all vector.
