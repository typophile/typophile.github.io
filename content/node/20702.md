  ideas for locating it. The original was an outline font that the sender has blacked
  in. It looks 19th century to me, but Solotype Catalog & Art Nouveau books haven't
  helped yet.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?  Thanks"

  body: Know the source? Looks like it was inscribed by hand, not metal type. Lots
    of building lettering like this, with the ultra high waisted 'A' and slope-legged
    'R'.

  body: "I also have a sample of Post Oldstyle Roman. The cap R and S are similar,
    but the cap A and E are way off plus my sample seems much heavier (bookplate from
    T.J. Lyons collection of antique types).\r\n\r\nMike, since the lettering comes
    from a set of city development plans, isn't it likely that an old Varigraph or
    <a href=\"http://www.tpub.com/engbas/3-35.htm\" target=\"new\">LeRoy Mechanical
    Lettering</a> system was used by engineers? Especially since it was originally
    in outline form?"

    sense they must have had other styles. You've seen ones that were outline lettering?\r\n\r\nI
    agree about the Post Old Style E, but I thought the A was similar. It wasn't that
    I thought that was the answer, just that it was the closest I had found so far.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I never used the LeRoy system, but I did use a Varigraph and another mechanical
    pantograph system whose name I can't recall.\r\n\r\nThe Varigraph had several
    sets of templates with several lettering styles. I can remember using Stymie Bold
    and Franklin Gothic(ish) styles. You traced using a stylus in the template (metal),
    the pen nibs were connected to the other end of a pantograph arm. You could size
    and slant of desired lettering by adjusting dials near fulcrum of arm.\r\n\r\nAfter
    outlining in ink, I had to fill in the characters by hand with India ink. These
    kind of lettering devices were very common with architects and engineers.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the Post Old Style, on closer look the \"A\" is somewhat similar.\r\n(Sorry
    about poor repro... quick snapshot. I could scan tomorrow if you'd like.)\r\nObviously
    my sample is the bold weight (Post Old Style Roman No. 2), but notice the difference
    in the cap S treatment between 10 pt. (slightly slanted) and the 24 pt. (upright).
    Also note the 24 pt. lowercase \"y\"... I love this old stuff!!!\r\n\r\n(edit-a-bit):
    There are 2 cap \"S\" in the 10 pt. sample. One is roman (POST) and one is italic???

  body: "Yes, Norbert, I have also been looking for samples of other template lettering,
    but only found Old English. I agree that using manual lettering tools would make
    sense, since it lets anyone make professional-looking letterforms on any size
    drawing. However, when Trina said that she thought these were current drawings,
    it raises the possibility of using a plotter-printer with computer fonts.\r\n\r\nStill,
    it surprises me that they would use such an archaic-looking style on modern documents.The
    only digital versions I can think of right away of typefaces that I think have
    a similar antique feel are <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/windsor-sb/\">Windsor</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/musketeer/\">Musketeer</a>. I
    think Stephen's suggestion is a bit too formal looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I apologize to Mike, but the sample I sent in was extremely old, as he originally
    thought! I didn't see the whole thing in context so assumed it was fairly recent.
    We do get in a lot of plans from various firms still using old fashioned/outdated
    lettering systems, believe it or not! So I am attaching a larger sample and am
    waiting to receive the book that contained the full plan where I can get a better
    scan. I eventually want to mimic this lettering for an upcoming project. Thanks
    again for all your knowledge; it has been interesting reading.\r\n\r\nTrina[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stcharles_4569.jpg]"

  body: "Seeing more of the lettering makes it look like this might have been hand
    lettered, although I realize that the details of different type sizes would often
    vary within a typeface. In this sample, notice how the smaller E's are not the
    same as the large one in 'CHARLES'. It's not even clear that the identical letters
    in the same size are actually identical.\r\n\r\nTwo questions Trina:\r\n\r\n1)
    Can you see variation in the identical letters in the original, or is that just
    the scan? (To me, the S's for example, do not look <em>identical</em>, even though
    the shapes are about the same.)\r\n\r\n2) What is the actual date of the document?
    (This could help rule out certain styles, although if you just want to look like
    this it may not matter.)\r\n\r\nA problem may be finding digital types that will
    be close enough for your purposes, but making any font into an outline is the
    easy part.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
