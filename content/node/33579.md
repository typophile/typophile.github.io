  body: Well, Futura from Adobe allows editable embedding, the Futuras from ScanGraphic,
    EF and Bitstream allow read only embedding, as does Lanston's 20th Century.

    that has come and gone. It's not a practical option anymore.\r\n\r\nOr are you
    referring to PDF/Flash embedding?"

  body: I was referring to Flash/SiFR. But, the client has decided to stick with Neutraface
    so we will only use it in static images. Thanks guys.

    OK, fine. I'll grant them that one. But it's still absurd, IMHO. Why should the
    substrate change the license? (That said, I concede that that is not an uncommon
    concept especially when you look at licensed stock photography and the like...)"

  body: "It comes down to two things, I think. (Based on recent EULA research.) \r\n\r\n1.
    Many foundries do not trust the current technology to protect their IP.\r\n2.
    All businesses have the right to determine what their fonts are worth and in what
    instances the fonts become worth more.\r\n\r\nYeah, sad, but I don't charge based
    on the project, necessarily, either. I charge by what the client needs too."

  body: "\"most foundries will allow embedding, but with a different license\"...\r\n\r\nYes,
    but an embedding license for House fonts which allows for general use adds a fee
    of $150 PER YEAR for each font, so an embedding license for the full range of
    Neutraface fonts means you would be paying an additional $2,250 PER YEAR, over
    the original one time cost of $249. \r\n\r\nThat's a <em>very</em> different license,
    \ \"to be fair\" !\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that they shouldn't charge that fee,
    I'm just saying I wouldn't pay it, I'd buy something else. They're clearly not
    trying to sell to small time operators like me."

    require the fonts in the PDF (sent to them for printing) to be embedded. Usually
    subsetting is OK. So, the *unembeddable fonts* can't be used for printing either,
    except I guess on your personal laser/inkjet printer.\r\n\r\nAs the man said;
    \"Friends don't let friends buy such things.\" "

  body: "Just to clear up any confusion about our license:\r\n\r\nIf you look at our
    <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=licensing&section=pricing\">licensing
    pricing page</a>, you'll see that \"our base license does, however, allow you
    to embed fonts in a .pdf to be sent to a service bureau or printer.\" Where we
    do charge extra is for cases when one is using the fonts in a PDF document that
    is sent out for distribution (as in the case of a PDF newsletter). If the text
    is non-editable, then it is either 10 cents per PDF sent, or a flat fee of $150
    dollars for the year.  John is correct that this is per font. However it is just
    for the fonts used in the PDF document, so I doubt that one would run into the
    case of having to embed every font in the Neutraface family into a PDF. Also note,
    that the yearly fee is the one that is re-occurring, and only if you are still
    distributing PDFs with the font in it.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs that are editable, we treat
    the PDF file like a raster device, meaning that one does need to have a license
    for each PDF. This is licensed at our multiple device site license pricing schedule
    (which gives a very healthy discount to multiple licenses).\r\n\r\nFor Flash,
    we judge the fee on a case by case basis, though in general this is free for static
    text (meaning text that isn't being edited by a user, not text that is moving
    around the screen) and with a fee for a font being embedded as 'dynamic' text.
    Call us and we'll be more than happy to help you out."

  body: Thanks Ben. I should've made that point right away. I didn't mean this to
    turn into a negative thread. I respect the EULA which came with my license of
    Neutraface and that is why I was searching for an alternative in the even that
    my client thought they might like some sort of embedding which might be questionable.
