  However, he desperately wants to use \"Myriad pro\" as his corporate font for writing
  letters etc. etc.\r\nwould that be legit? mixing two sans serif fonts? \r\n\r\ncheers

  body: You can mix two sans serifs successfully. Myriad pro is a good innocuous sans
    compared with Dax, I'd guess -- without seeing it -- that it would work ... Depending
    upon how you use both.

  body: hmm... i don't think there's enough contrast between dax and myriad. Like
    Miss Tiffany said, though, if you can figure out a way to really set them apart,
    it may work. Can't you convince the client to consider Dax Light as their corporate
    font?

    se</em>. Probably the more important issue is using Myriad Pro for body text.

  body: "The catch with using them together is to make sure that they aren\u2019t
    used in remotely similar weights or sizes anywhere near each other. Mixing sans
    fonts (or some serifs) becomes a problem when the two fonts look mostly, but not
    entirely alike, generating a sort of visual dissonance for the reader. "

    similar character to their stroke weights and inflection. it's all about contrast.\r\nMyriad\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/09f5d440eeaa4a8ce69c009ca2797aa5_4939.png]\r\n\r\nDax

    best option would be to keep the dax (mybe in some other weights) as corporate
    font and if not then a serif font. right?\r\n\r\ncheers mike"

  body: "It isn\u2019t mixing the two if one is a logo and the other is a corporate
    font, it would be a rare corporate ID that places the logo and corporate font
    that close together, a lot of this depends on what relationship the two will have
    to each other so maybe you could show us.\r\n\r\nTim"

    I do, now seems greedy, do you want to borrow one?
