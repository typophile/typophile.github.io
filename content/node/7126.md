    purchase a  <BR>font, you get a floppy or CD-ROM, and if it was purchased  <BR>over
    the internet you have the compressed archives. And  <BR>even if you lost all of
    these, you still can send a copy of your  <BR>invoice to the reseller to prove
    you own a license, so they  <BR>can send you new files. <BR> <BR>So how on earth
    can you manage to &#34;lose fonts&#34;?
