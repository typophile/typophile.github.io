body: "Hello everyone,\r\nI try to explain you the problem.\r\n\r\nI created a typography
  that has both common (e.g. between \"f\" and \"i\") and custom (e.g. between \"p\"
  and \"p\") ligatures and used FontLab to export the font in ttf.\r\nNow I want an
  HTML page to display the font and I write & #xFB01 for common ligature between \"f\"
  and \"i\".\r\nBut where should I operate to display custom ligature between \"p\"
  and \"p\"?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your attention!\r\nFilippo"
