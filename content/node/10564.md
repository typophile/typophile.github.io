body: Microsoft just now put up a spec and other info for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/print/metro_FAQ.mspx">Metro</a>,
  their new document format. I haven&#39;t had a chance to read the specs carefully
  yet, but I will be over the next few days, as this is potentially an important subject
  for my work. Things certainly promise to get interesting in the document format
  world.

  body: Can something written in XML really rival Postscript  for sofisticated WYSIWYG
    printing? <BR> <BR>What about font embedding? document signing, user notes, zoom
    &#40;free scaling&#41; etc? <BR> <BR>Microsoft tried and failed to unseat PDF
    with the e-book format. Metro does sound scary - that its free, like IE was free
    back in the 1st browser wars. It will probably be tied to MS Office Suite for
    authoring, or any office suite for that matter, since its nuts and bolts are available
    to all. <BR> <BR>http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/04/25/HNmetro_1.html <BR>

  body: 'ed: at the syntactic level, being based on XML vs. the Forth-like stack language
    in PostScript is pretty much a wash. It will no doubt result in large files and
    take lots more memory to run, but what else is new? Also keep in mind that PostScript
    hasn&#39;t seen any new development for about six years; Adobe&#39;s been putting
    their resources into PDF instead. <BR> <BR>Metro is definitely resolution independent,
    being based on the Avalon imaging model. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t yet have authoritative
    answers to your other questions, but from what I&#39;ve seen so far I would be
    <i>very</i> surprised to see Metro lack any significant and useful feature present
    in PDF.'

  body: Thanks Raph, probably in future we well see Acrobat&#39;s price drop? yay!
    ... then developers or designers dealing with 2 standards ... hohum ... <BR> <BR>But
    I think Microsoft is after the &#34;electronic paper&#34; for businesses and goverment
    market &#40;secure forms etc&#41; rather than DTP market. DTP market is too small
    for MS and they don&#39;t sell the precision authoring tools for those. <BR> <BR>Very
    exciting news this, battle of the goliaths? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>&#40;sorry for my english tho ;&#41;&#41;

  body: '&#34;Can something written in XML really rival Postscript for sofisticated
    WYSIWYG printing?&#34; <BR> <BR>XML is just a descriptive language like Postscript.
    XML is just a container for data, so I imagine the document format can be as elaborate
    as the data entered. &#40;SVG is all xml based too&#41;. <BR> <BR>I agree with
    Ed, MS &#40;nor adobe, really&#41; are currently after the DTP market. They&#39;re
    after the enterprise document management market. The one advantage of PDF is that
    is has a rather strong following outside of Adobe &#40;Ghostscript, etc.&#41;
    and the one advantage of MS&#39;s offering is that it&#39;s XML based...but there
    can be a big difference between XML and &#39;MS&#39; XML. ;o&#41;'

  body: Perhaps this is related to Adobe&#39;s acquisition of Macromedia? In that
    Adobe may integrate PDFs and Flash to create a more flexible PDF online, etc.
    to keep this MS offering at bay. <BR> <BR>I always worry when one company has
    far-and-away dominance, but I get an extra chill with MS, since they&#39;re OS
    producers &#40;and therefore biased towards their own environment&#41;. I admit,
    I hope it flops just so I don&#39;t have to deal with its inevitable rancor on
    other OSes.

  body: Does anyone here have Office XP &#34;Small Business Edition&#34;? The Metro
    spec is in Microsoft Office Document Imaging format, which is fairly obscure.
    If someone could convert that into PDF for me, it would be a mitzvah. Send mail
    to &#60;firstname&#62;.&#60;lastname&#62;@gmail.com to coordinate.
