  catalog and was wondering if anybody knew of a digitized version. Also, if anybody
  can ID the \"A LOVE-SPECTACULAR as well that would be super duper exciting. thanks,\r\ndanny[img:sites/default/files/old-images/koBJdk6EOh15odynl9XkIyl5o1_500_6479.jpg]"

  body: "PAUL NEWMAN looks like Normandia Open, except it seems a bit condensed compared
    to the sample in the Phil's Photo book (from 1985  -- film types). I don't know
    of a digital version. Didoni is a rather similar font, and so is Carousel.\r\n\r\n-
