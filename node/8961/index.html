  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So, I'm beginning to think about teaching my modern political thought course in the fall, and about ways&ndash;O idealistic me&ndash;to persuade students to take the material seriously and spend some time struggling with it, instead of dipping into and out of it after their whim or curiosity or emotional reaction, as if it were so many piles of blog commentary. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hit upon the idea of spending some time discussing with students what the very act of writing, then publishing, material in the past was like. Most everyone today composes on the computer, in air-conditioned rooms, on more or less comfortable chairs, with plenty of artificial light. Typesetting and printing, for those manuscripts that find their way into print, is done by people working in similar circumstances, most often without the need&ndash;unless the method is deliberately chosen&ndash;for physical typesetting and the pressing of letters into paper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But&ndash;to pick the example of the first author the students will be reading next term&ndash;Thomas Hobbes would have had to write his manuscript out by hand, with pens that had to be dipped, on expensive paper, in rooms without the benefit of temperature controls, on wooden furniture, under bad light . . . you get the idea. Things obviously would be even more unlike today's writers' lairs the farther back in history you go.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Under those circumstances, it seems like you would take writing&ndash;and books and printing&ndash;very seriously, because you invest so much in the act, certainly more than the Ann Coulters and Michael Moores of today do in what appears in print under their names.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, the combination of something really important to say and conditions that require a lot of investment in saying it would mean we could assume that even in very long manuscripts everything on paper is there for a reason. Authors would spend a long time thinking and talking about what they had to say in advance, they would gather their evidence and craft their arguments carefully, and they would make every word tell. Printers, for their part, would not take on jobs lightly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This in turn demands (the punchline would go) that we read what they wrote differently than we would read the Coulters and Moores of today. Differently, even, than we might read the Strausses, the Arendts, the Rawlses, the Nozicks, the Blooms, and the Habermases of today. Not because the older authors are &quot;better&quot; or &quot;got it right,&quot; and not because many later authors are not also worth struggling with, but because the acts and circumstances of writing and publishing in the past produced prose meant to be read in different ways. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Setting my windmills and tilting aside, of course I have only my general sense of social and technological history upon which to draw to make this case. The above may be no better than a caricature of how things really were, and I don't want to do my students the disservice of blustering through some harebrained tale that reads like the five feet of snow our grandparents walked through every day to get to school (even in summer, and uphill both ways!). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's where I hoped Typophiliacs might help me out. Are there good books on the history of the physical act and circumstances of writing and publishing relevant to the story I want to tell that I could consult to extend and/or correct it? Anything to suggest I'm on the right track or completely full of it? Thanks for whatever you can recommend.</div>

Man makes both speculations of his own, and summarizes the speculations of others he seems to agree with. A good attempt is made throughout the book at trying to get an angle on Gutenberg's business operations; how much money he had, where he got it, depts, court cases and other civil &amp; legal records, etc. One can easily imagine how things could have gone the other way for Gutenberg, changing the course of history (at least a little bit</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maurice, another note to make to your students about Thomas Hobbes is that most of the early editions of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leviathan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were published outside of Britain, because the book was banned in Britain within a few years of its publication. Because it was difficult for Hobbes to control the publishing on the continent, a number of pirate editions also appeared (for instance, the bookshop I used to work at had one in the Netherlands in the 1670s). So you have a good example here of the impact of political censorship on the life of a book.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I read somewhere recently that the idea of silent reading may not have surfaced until well into the medieval period, if not later. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the note on the Greek philosophers also brought to mind something else. There is a story that during the performance of a Greek play there was an earthquake and the roof collapsed killing and crushing beyond recognition most of the audience. One of the actors was able to identify the remains simply by the seating arrangement as he had memorized it during the play. The art of memorization was highly tuned as there was no other way to record ephemeral information. Too bad I can't remember where I read that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Two important aspects of the ability to physically reproduce text are: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The Reformation was promoted by the ability to get printed Bibles to everyone. Protestantism promoted the rise of European individualism, and so printing was a key factor. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. As my late Uncle Ben Lieberman liked to point out, freedom of the press is first of all the freedom to own and use a press. Nowadays with desk top publishing it is hard to imagine this, but only twenty years ago this was an important factor in the fall of the Soviet Union. George Soros disseminated photocopy machines - a kind of press - in Eastern Europe, which may well have hastened the fall of the Communist empire.</div>
