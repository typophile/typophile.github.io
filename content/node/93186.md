  Type describes our time today? \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nI have a question which I
  would be very grateful if you could give me an answer to, a tip, your point of view.
  I am about to do my Bachelor this semester and I would like to do a Font Specimen
  'in/with' pictures i.e involving human faces/models. It should be something like
  bringing fashion photography and typography together, on both booklet and poster.\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to do something for the age, like portraying a feeling of today, like contemporary
  people.\r\nFor me - and of course for all of us I can guess - Types are more than
  just Fonts, forms and words put together, there is a soul, a character behind and
  there is only one accurate or the right one for a topic.\r\n\r\nI was guessing that,
  seeing as the world is today, we were going back to some sort of Bauhaus when it
  comes to graphics and architecture - design in general. I see more and more a going-back-to-simple-shapes
  aesthetic, geometric forms are everywhere. I see it more often in combination with
  a Black and White theme, and although i feel like 2012 is more about colors and
  having 'fun' (when it comes to fashion, too) you can never go wrong with black and
  white and some sort of mystery/dark look to attract attention or sell (think also
  drama/exagerated poses in fashion, Hollywood, raw european films, books about burn
  out - thinking also that everything is part of a cycle and everything infuences
  one another in society...)\r\n\r\nSo would you think a Sans-Serif, Futura, Bifur
  Type describes our time today? \r\n\r\nMuch appreciation if someone takes the time
  to read and share thoughts.\r\n\r\nKind regards!\r\nR.V \r\n"

    body: "hi thanks for the comment.\r\ni dont feel that if i say that we are some
      sort of futura or bauhaus type now, we are on a better position than maybe 10
      years ago. Those are also rather synthetic types from my point of view...but
      they are also clear and i feel there IS some more clarity now than 50 years
      ago, not only in design but in general.."

  body: "Is there something wrong with today\u2019s type designers, that you don\u2019t
    think our work is capable of representing our age?\r\n\r\nFutura was designed
    as \u201Cthe typeface of our time\u201D in the 1920s, as an antidote to the historicism
    then prevalent in the graphic arts.\r\n\r\nPresently, too, we have a lot of historicism,
    namely a nostalgia for \u201Cmid century modern\u201D.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you
    judge the tenor of the times by the work of contemporary type designers, rather
    than the types that are popular with graphic designers (which includes many old
    faces such as Helvetica and Futura), I think you will \uFB01nd that some of us
    are creating work that addresses today\u2019s issues, rather than those faced
    by Paul Renner, and such work is more likely to be \u201CType for our Age\u201D.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a pioneering recognition by a cultural institution of contemporary (with a
    slight lag for respectability) type design within the canon of art and design
    in general:\r\nhttp://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/01/24/digital-fonts-23-new-faces-in-moma-s-collection\r\n"

  body: "I think the typeface of the age we are currently living in is obviously Times
    Roman.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that Stone Sans, for example, is a typeface
    of the present moment. But I don't think we've yet caught up with Futura, let
    alone Optima - these are still typefaces that, although \"dated\" in the sense
    that we can point to the past time when they were designed, still look out of
    place - and futuristic! - when used for ordinary typographic purposes.\r\n\r\nSo
    the original poster has a legitimate question as to whether or not now is yet
    the time for Bifur or Futura - but the answer, I think, is no!\r\n\r\nThe ages
    of typography move slowly; we have gone from the Age of Caslon to the Age of Scotch
    Roman (and Phemister's Oldstyle) to the Age of Century Expanded (and Linotype's
    Number Eleven, and Caledonia, and Baskerville) to the Age of Times Roman."

    choice than Futura. It's a relatively new font that was inspired by fonts like
    Futura, and was heavily used by the Obama campaign. I also see a lot of corporate
    use. \r\n\r\nYou also might try checking lists of the best-selling fonts from
    2011, although the fonts that actually receive the most use are often the old
    standbys rather than what's hot at the moment.\r\n\r\n> i feel like 2012 is more
    about colors and having 'fun'\r\n\r\nDesign trends are partially influenced by
    the technology available to graphic designers. I see far less black-and-white
    because 1) on the internet color doesn't cost more than b&w, and 2) the increased
    use of digital printing. Also you see color transparency effects everywhere because
    InDesign makes it easy. In the old days of QuarkXPress (and the early days of
    InDesign) creating transparency effects was more iffy. You also see more 3D effects
    with type because it's easier to produce these days, more motion graphics, etc."

    today\u2019s issues\u201D.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Futura, it is considered iconic
    of its era, yet during the most famous years of the Modernist movement, Modernism
    was a cultural sideshow. During the 1920s, the dominant style of design was historicist,
    and the most used types were such as Kennerley, and, still, the plain early 19th
    century Roman we now call Scotch. (I\u2019m not quite sure where the Art & Crafts/proto-modernist
    Cheltenham \uFB01ts in.)\r\n\r\nThere are at least three ways a type can represent
    its age:\r\n<ol> <li>Address contemporary issues</li> <li>Popular in the dominant
    style: revival/older design</li><li>Popular in the dominant style: contemporary
    interpretation</li</ol>\r\nFor today:\r\n<ol> <li>Verdana</li> <li>Helvetica</li><li>
    Gotham</li</ol>\r\nOf course, one has to decide how long an age is\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hey there,\r\nyes, i suppose so. The idea was to give \"the font a face\".
      Fonts have their own character, and just like with us people, we tend to express
      our character through clothing, or body language. So i was thinking, how would
      Gotham pose in front of a camera, what would it wear..what kind of \"face\"
      would it have..petite, round, long..etc. Gotham is rather \"normal\"..so i kept
      the pictures with less drama (although i was inspired by fashion photography).
      I would love to make a serie one day. Maybe I should go with Futura the next,
      it was  my fav. font for a long time. Thanks for your comment!"

  body: "I would be curious to see a whole series indeed. Right now I think the choice
    of typeface serves as a nice basis for photography, but it's not like without
    a doubt these photos say Gotham. It's perhaps representative of a certain time
    and culture, but I don't think you could represent all typefaces this way. The
    photos of Futura would probably look more German and perhaps Bauhaus-inspired,
    but the time is about the same. When you've done Gotham and Futura, what would
    a third typeface that draws inspiration from the same sources look like? What
    about typefaces like Erbar, Nobel and Tempo? What about Verlag and Neutraface?
    Would it suffice to make a visual story out of its sources or should the time
    and requirements it was actually designed in/for be part of it as well?\r\n\r\nSome
    typefaces look subtly different so it may be a lot more challenging to translate
    that to photography. On the other hand, with photography you can visualize a back
    story which is a lot harder to do with just a typeface. Because the typeface is
    hard to translate into a visual story, I'm curious what the restrictions are exactly.
    What would/could a type catalog without type look like?"

    body: "Aah, i love feedback.\r\nYou are right, this is just the basis of something
      that CAN grow larger, having the sufficient time and sources. In photography
      it is often said, that the tools you need to make something possible, are the
      ones that you already have. Its a nice sentiment, but you can't work on natural
      light all the time, a blunt model and an empty room. You can't tell a whole
      story with only a white background. Then again, that might be the challenge.\r\n\r\n\"Would
      it suffice to make a visual story out of its sources or should the time and
      requirements it was actually designed in/for be part of it as well?\" -- I had
      only 3 days to get in the studio, get into studio lighting and 1-2 hours with
      each model. I had objects around as a plan B with which I wanted to portray
      the time Gotham was build for.. but you can't do it any justice in a rush. Again,
      I second your \"this is only a basis\" comment.\r\n\r\n\"I'm curious what the
      restrictions are exactly. What would/could a type catalog without type look
      like?\" -- I might just dig into this more carefully and with a clearer view
      (and not thinking about university deadlines). I think it is important to make
      such a thing because we can understand something better when we are able to
      relate to it meaning, as graphic designers we could find the right type for
      something if it would be a lot more tangible to our nature.\r\n\r\n"
