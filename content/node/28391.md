  is a quotation form for my own little freelance business, which I'm still unsure
  whether to work it out as PDF forms or copy the whole thing in excel (for book keeping
  and admin purposes).\r\n\r\nI'm also unsure posting business documents in here,
  if this is against the rules please let me know, thanks! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nothing wrong with posting business documents. \r\n\r\nI know some people
    who do everything via PDF, but then they keep the \"bookkeeping\" part of it in
    a book after the fact. I'd think you would be happier using some sort of business
    software that can help you manage your books at the same time without having to
    keep a paper trail. (Although a paper trail is a good way to have secondary proof
    of something.)"

  body: "In payment terms (shouldn't that be a lowercase p) the numerals aren't aligning
    and the grand total doesn't seem to align with hk$ and the numerals, I think you
    have a double word space in extra cost. And the tint rules for the job description
    section could align with the dotted rules. You will also need to standardise the
    punctuation and uppercase in the remarks section.\r\nIf you can create an excel
    file that keeps the look you want it would seem to me that it would be the sensible
    way to go.\r\nTim\r\nbtw Facsimile and shipments"
