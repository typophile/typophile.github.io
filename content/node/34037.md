  body: It looks similar, but the "Q" and "G" are different. This "G" has a spur,
    which I don't see on Antenna... unless there are alternate characters?

  body: Mr. B. Condensed does't like me any more, 'cause I said he dances better than
    he compares fonts. Now, you have proof. He does dance amazingly however, so its
    not that his type spotting skills are bad.;)

  body: Yes, but can he dance AND identify fonts at the same time? Hmmm...

    of it ...

    earth would I ever be able to <em>not</em> like you anymore, David? Really! I
    don't mind differing opinions. In fact, I think it's enriching to have my point
    of view offset to someone else's.\r\n\r\nAnd BTW, I did this ID while running
    out of the office, without checking it. That's why it reads: \"I think\" etc.
    I've been wrong before. ;^)\r\n\r\nOne more thing -- Rhode kicks major booty;
    it's a wonderful family. Uncut has been using it for quite a long time, and it
    was a joy to read."
