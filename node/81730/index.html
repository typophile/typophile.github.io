Your b,d,p,q don't relate well, your u looks like a y (it is a y) and they are both too narrow, and your caps are a mess. That M is going to kill you, and the J is going to catch itself on the ledge and break its neck. It would behoove you to show the caps and the lowercase at the same size. Sizing them to fit on one line does no one any good.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have to agree with James - there are frankly a lot of fundamental problems here.  :-(

Looking at your more attractive glyphs (like the "k" and "y") I'm getting the distinct feeling that -with work- this might click as a gently slanted face. I don't mean an Italic, I mean a Roman with a slant. And for one thing, that would make it stand out from the "me too" crowd.

Actually, thank you to everyone who has commented. This is my first ever attempt at designing type (I'm sure you all could have guessed that) and as is my nature, I never concede to defeat and am willing, despite the time, to see this through. I'll post some updates in a bit.</div>

Would you say I'm moving in the right direction now? I played with the proportions and contrast and really focused on unity throughout all of the glyphs. I realize, of course, it's still far from anything resembling a finished font.

Also, I apologize for these terrible images (once I have something more refined, if I ever do, I will make sure to put everything in a pdf), and I really appreciate everyone's help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I know this is going to sound harsh, given the amount of work you believe you have done, but the whole thing still looks sloppy.

From a proportional standpoint, look how much white space is present in the h, n, m, u, and then contrast that with the round forms (b,d,q,p,o,c,e). Either the round forms are too narrow or those others are too wide. The very vertical characterization of the p, b, d, q, seems at odds with the rounder o, e, c. The v and y look drunk in comparison those the other glyphs.The middle of the w is too wide compared to the right and left side. The f and t look to narrow, and the foot on the l does not need to be there. The bottom bowl on the g is too narrow and a bit square. the bottom diagonal of the k needs to move more to the left. The x is terrible, and overall the spacing is really, really bad.

I tell my students that a properly spaced and poorly drawn font is much more useful than a beautifully drawn poorly spaced one. If you concentrate on spacing this sucker, it will give you more insight into how to draw it.

Good luck.</div>

The w/x/v need the most work and the g looks too narrow. My biggest struggle with the w/x and v is due to the direction of the terminals and their effect on the balance of the characters. Hopefully, I'll eventually be able to sort this out.</div>

They are pretty low and I wasn't too sure how to vertically balance them with the asymmetrical terminals. I think the j needs to be moved farther to the right due to the lack of the bottom right-ward terminal.

I'm really glad you like this direction. It took me a while to realize that I can't always force something to work (especially when the original concept is flawed).</div>

Side comment: To simply invert the screen on a Mac, go to System Prefs > Universal Access, and toggle the «White on Black» thing. The shortcut should be Cmd + Alt + Shift + 8. According to Hrant, on Windows it's the left Alt key, the left Shift key, plus PrintScreen. (See this comment thread on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/5895054908/ )</div>

That's something I'm not too sure about yet (the lc/uc blackness). Most oldstyle faces I've looked at seem to exaggerate this difference (I presume to help differentiate letters at smaller sizes), so I've gone that route. In the little example posted below, I think it looks alright to my eyes bit then again, I'm no expert and I'm still adjusting everything.

I've really been working with adjusting that lately. I'm thinking of having the caps blend in with a lower case in the regular weight and have them stand out a little more in the bold and semibold.

Also, while I was working on this, I had a crazy though: would the second /W/ here be worth considering (right now, it's just two /V/s)?

		<div class="commentbody">> <cite>I'm thinking of having the caps blend in with a lower case in the regular weight and have them stand out a little more in the bold and semibold.</cite>

Sounds like a plan that makes a lot of sense.

Hm, not sure about that new "W". It gets much more complex and dense than the other letters so it might just stick out too much (and clog – you'll probably hate making the Bold). Personally I'd probably stick with the one you had before but (1) make it a little narrower and (2) you might try lowering the apex – maybe it doesn't have to reach all the way up to the cap line. That way it can also get a little less wide.</div>

You're right and I did end up giving up on the alternate /W/. The apex is actually a bit lower but I suppose I should change it a bit more so it doesn't look like an upside-down /M/.

I'm glad you like the idea about the caps.</div>

The horn seems to be the most unusual diacritic with regards to placement. From what I have researched, the horn on the /u/ can be either moved down or sticking out of the top (usually it is based on whether the face is serif or not).

Most every example I've found has the horn on the /O's/ and the /U's/ reaching a different height. 

I assume you're more correct than myself on this matter.</div>
