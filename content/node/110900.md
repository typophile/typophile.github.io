  with a nice weight and takes color well. Currently, I am using a 32lb white paper
  for my resume and power point presentations. Thank you very much for your time. '

  body: Try Mohawk and their various product lines (Strathmore etc). They'll send
    you free swatches. Mokawk Superfine Ultrawhite (or whatever the brightest shade
    is called) is one possible candidate for "the absolute finest white" paper. Also
    try Monadnock, or, for a cheaper solution, Finch and Neena papers.

    you might want to print them, but if interviewing in person I might demo PowerPoints
    using a laptop so that transitions, animations, etc. could be seen."
