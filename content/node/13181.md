body: "My daughter was born about 3 weeks ago and we're just now getting around to
  sending out the birth announcements. Being the stickler that I sometimes am, I want
  to make sure, once and for all, that I understand the usage of a diaerisis in her
  name. Her name is Chlo\xEB. We live in the States and have Canadian heritage. \r\n\r\nI
  researched the diaerisis before naming her and found info in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis\"
  target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a> on the mark. It was that info that led my wife and
  I to want to include it in her name. \r\n\r\nOn her announcement, I wanted to include
  a simple explanation of the diaerisis for people, so I looked it up again. This
  time I found more info over at the <a href=\"http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=14\"
  target=\"_blank\">Diactitics project</a>. Now I'm not sure if we should use it or
  not.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know the proper use of the diaerisis in english names?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    interesting situations throughout her life. Typists of official documents will
    invariably not know how to enter the \xEB on their keyboards. They will spell
    Chlo\xEB's name Chloe. This isn't a reason not to name her Chlo\xEB, though.\r\n\r\n\xEB
    is an ancient abreviation of the ee combination, I believe. The proper way for
    Chlo\xEB to spell her name usung ASCII-only systems would be Chloee. She should
    be able able to tell people that. Like the DMV attendant, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Dan, I think you're confusing the dieresis with the umlaut. They're different
    things, even though they are the same mark.\r\n\"G\xF6del\" = \"Goedel\". That's
    an umlaut.\r\n\"Na\xEFve\" contains a dieresis, which simply indicates that the
    two vowels should be pronounced separately instead of as a diphthong. It's not
    supposed to be \"naieve.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican official documents tend to disregard
    all diacritics, and using them is up to the individual, just as pronunciation
    is. A person can suddenly decide to start writing their name with an accent at
    their own discretion, without getting any kind of official name change."

    \"nai-eve\", the \"\xEF\" is broken into two sounds, \"ai\" and \"ee\". With the

  body: "No, a vowel with an umlaut is a distinct letter, which is always written
    that way regardless of context. It is pretty much limited to the orthographies
    of some Germanic language. In all other languages I can think of, the two dots
    indicate a diaeresis, which is placed above the second vowel in a two-vowel sequence
    to indicate that they are pronounced independently and not as a diphthong or compound
    vowel (e.g. co\xF6peration, a spelling that has fallen out of use in English).
    Since you're living in Germany, I'm not surprised that you are confused :)\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that the diaeresis originated in Greek texts, where it is known as dialytika,
    and distinguishes e.g. \u03B5\u03CA from the diphthong \u03B5\u03B9\r\n\r\nChlo\xEB
    and Chloe are both accepted spellings in English. Many people will consider the
    diaeresis optional, so your daughter can probably get through life using either
    spelling.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The indication of \"Umlaut\" and the \"diaeresis\" had been different forms
    of sign before:\r\nThe Umlaut consists of two strokes. As I read somewhere (maybe
    here?) it roots from a small \"e\" written in brokenscript (formed like an \"11\")
    over the umlaut base character. The german word \"Umlaut\" means \"a change in
    the sound\".\r\nThe diaeresis obviously always had been two dots - indicating
    two different sounds. The greek word \"diairesis\" means \"splitting up, dividing,
    cutting up\" (and it belongs to same field as \"heretic\" meaning division that
    separates from the others). \r\n\r\nSo confusion of both is only coming from the
    reduction of the two strokes to two points. \r\nAs german language for a long
    time has been associated and developped in brokenscript (with strokes) and on
    the other hand latin script evolved without a sign for \"umlaut\" the confusion
    began, when the two strokes where taken from broken script to latin script and
    interpreted as points. \r\n"

  body: "Good. We'll keep it then. It doesn't really matter to me if most people won't
    bother with the diaerisis. And she can choose to use it, or not, when she's older.
    I've seen the name Chlo\xEB with and without the diaerisis and people still seem
    to pronounce it correctly. Like \"co\xF6peration\", I never realized before that
    \"cooperation\" was technically wrong, yet, it's so accepted. Funny. Hopefully
    she'll grow up to enjoy and appreciate the special mark in her name.\r\n\r\nThe
    trick is explaining to people how to type the diaerisis on a Windows system. It's
    amazing to me that <em>they</em> (the big M\u2026) made using diacritics so obscure
    and complicated. Come on!\r\n\r\nThanks for all your feedback. "

    you almost answered all my questions which are like Bouch's.  My only question
    now is, I just noticed some are spelling Chloe with an acute accent.  What pronunciation
    does that produce?

  body: "The \xA8 character really needs a more generic name along the lines of 'double
    dot\u2019. Umlaut and Diaeresis both indicate a particular function, so don't
    serve particularly well as a name for the accent itself. They also don't exhaust
    the list of functions served by this particular diacritic, since the n\u0308 character
    used in Malagasy and Jacaltec denotes neither umlaut nor diaeresis. And Jacaltec
    n\u0308 has entirely distinct function from the n\u0308 in \u2018Sp\u0131n\u0308al
    Tap\u2019 (which I assume is proncounced [spa\u026A\u032Fn\u0259l] rather than
    [sp\u0268\u014Bal]).\r\n\r\nSince English too suffers from umlaut, I propose we
    start spelling words like \u2018geese\u2019 as \u2018g\xF6\xF6se\u2019. This would
    not constitute an appreciable orthographic improvement, but it would force English
    speakers to learn how to type diacritics.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    it is meant to indicate the the second letter is pronounced: e.g., co\xF6perate
    is pronounced co-operate rather than cooper-ate. In your example, the name is
    pronounced C(h)lo-e rather than clue, as in shoe, or cloe, as in sloe."
