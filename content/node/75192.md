body: "Has anyone studied the proportions (width) of [[Hebrew]] letters - obviously
  they are not simply based upon squares. The letters of Koren seem to have fairly
  different proportions than other typefaces. Hadassa is set quite wide. For the spacing
  of hebrew fonts, is it all done by eye? Has anyone ever made comparisons oh existing
  Hebrew typefaces? Are there perhaps any guidelines?\r\n\r\nI think if someone made
  some comparisons of several fonts, by overlaying letters which are scaled to the
  same body-height, we could understand proportions of Hebrew fonts more easily. Prime
  examples of \"serif\" fonts like Koren, Hadassa, and Frank-Ruhl - and any other
  very common examples - and \"sans-serif\" fonts, with which I am less familiar,
  but may include Narkis Tam, Erica Sans, and Jan LeWitt's Chaim."

  body: "Square letter typically means a block-like letter form, as opposed to script
    typeface design like Rashi or David Nitui which are called round letters.\r\n\r\nVilna
    though is very wide, more than other letter designs, appearing to close to square.
    Plus Vilna is claimed to be an exemplary and earliest of the square letters.\r\n\r\nThis
    suggests that the square-like proportions are not simply block-like."

  body: 'Brian, I think you are on the right track in overlaying letters. The *relative*
    widths and spacing within a font, and then comparing how different fonts handle
    the different designs will tell you a lot. [[http://www.templesanjose.org/JudaismInfo/writing/Calligraphy.htm|This
    web site]] by a Sofer lays down rules for the widths of the characters relative
    to nib width, for writing the STAM style. I don''t know how valid they are, and
    in any case different designs will be different.  '

    a 3 x 3 grid, while most other employ different systems.\r\n\r\nI am curious if
    the Vilna design fits too into the 3 x 3 grid."

  body: I think the Stam design may offer some insights into corrects proportions.
    I am working on a design that differs greatly from Stam with contrast, having
    much less contrast, and lighter in weight, than many hebrew designs.

  body: "A lighter weight, Brian, yet with very wide widths like Stam (in proportion
    to its height), may have disasterous results. There may be way too mush white
    space within the letter forms.\r\n\r\nDo you see how Stam has strong thick vertical
    strokes. This creates a pleasing color balance between the wide open white spaces
    within the letters, and the thick strokes.\r\n\r\nTry to use some of the Stam
    proportions with 2/3 to 3/4 of the Stam widths, and it should work."

  body: "Bill, we speak more about Stam's proportions and metrics, not about its design
    and appearance.\r\n\r\nMost every modern Hebrew type design uses different proportions,
    except Romm Vilna. Friedlander merge the modern and the ancient into his Hadasa,
    which Hudson does in part in his Adobe Hebrew, though he denies it.\r\n\r\nDo
    you think Adobe Hebrew (great name, John :) ), Bill, reveals Friedlaender's influence?"

  body: When I said Stam might offer insights into proportions, I didn't mean I wanted
    to take the proportions and just lighten everything. I meant moire along the lines
    of... proportions of say gimel to samek to he to alef, and so on.

  body: "I think I understand what you mean.\r\n\r\nYou are referring not to the appearance
    of the Stam font, ie its design. Rather, you are refering to its raw height and
    width proportions, and perhaps also to the thickness of its strokes.\r\n\r\nThey
    are 3 x 3 square grid. Most Hebrew typefaces are more rectangular, as in a 4 x
    3 grid, where the height is more than the width.\r\n\r\nThe Stam design is the
    Hebrew scribal design, and specific laws pertain to it in the Codes of Jewish
    law.\r\n\r\nI believe that you are suggesting to use Stam's proportions, or some
    of them, and to superimpose a different design within those proportions.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, this is fascinating. Only the Romm Vilna does this to a certain degree, and
    was mimicked to a less degree by Henri Friedlaender in Hadasa."

    though is not accurate completely, as a Sofer Stam, a Hebrew scribe, draws the
