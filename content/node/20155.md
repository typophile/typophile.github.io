  produces miniature-train accessories. Their type should have a classic twist. Like
  toy-packaging from the 1950's... \r\n\r\nI tried it with Lubalin Graph and Korinna
  but I don't think they fit to the train-theme too well...\r\n\r\nDo you have any
  suggestions for me?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I've been involved in this hobby off and on over the last ten years. There
    are two distinct camps: The model railroad people and the toy train people, and
    there is not much overlap. \r\n\r\nThe model railroad people are very into building
    realistic models--like something you might see in a museum. Anything that looks
    toy-like is to be avoided. \r\n\r\nThe toy train people, on the other hand, are
    not concerned much about realism, more concerned about animated accessories (like
    a crane that loads plastic logs onto a car) and other toy-oriented aspects. \r\n\r\nIf
    your target audience is the latter, then the toy packaging angle is probably good.
    If it's the model railroaders, you'd be better off taking your visual cues from
    real railroad stuff, not toys."
