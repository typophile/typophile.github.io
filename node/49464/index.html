It's not you Alex, it's not you! Eurostile is impossible to set. It always looks baggy and lifeless. Like a lank, dated hairdo. I rank it alongside some of the worst popular faces. Frankly it's a stinker. Its use should be limited purely to car dashboards.

A more appropriate face will communicate your branding to your customers more effectively. I'm the type expert so you should listen to me, or the bunny gets it, mkay?"

I can't think of a single corporate/finance outfit that makes successful use of Eurostile.

I blame neil Sedaka and his entourage.

I was armed with 7 powerpoint slides explaining what makes eurostile uglier tha FF Netto, but for no use. 

Do you have any examples of financial institutions who have made _unsuccessful_ use of Eurostile?

I don't think it's a total stinker. The bold caps are really nice. But the lower case ... all spikes and boxes.

If you need okay-lc with an eurostile touch, Foundry Monoline could be the way to go.
Or try FF Max, for a contemporary alternative. 
Or you go Eurostile uc extended bold, grey on black ;)

I’ve never seen a good logo using eurostile, it always seemed of the day before yesterday to me and - even worse - incredibly cheap. And I’m just talking about logos here.

I really feel with you my friend, I was forced once to use E.S. for a project. After that, I drove away 2 or 3 clients because I refused to use E.S.

But I think the best way to use it anyway is to keep it as small as possible with a generously increased tracking.

It looks like Eurostile, and this was released a couple of weeks ago. Personally I think it looks terrible, but I dont know the whole story why it ended up this way. It was done by a swedish agency, and I dont feel proud ;-)</div>

I will third the use of Foundry Monoline for text. Call it the text version of Eurostile. I first became aware of Foundry Monoline after visiting MoMA:QNS and viewing their way-finding program. It was, I though, the best looking use of Eurostile I'd ever seen. Turns out it was FM. I couldn't find any decent images of the interior signage at MoMA:QNS since it's now closed (it was the temporary home of MoMA). However, you can see some of it at the portfolio site of the designers: http://www.twotwelve.com/flash/ >> Projects >> MoMA QNS >> Images 2&3. FM was used for the QNS Matisse Picasso exhibit -- the program used it for text.

Good luck!

I agree. It looks great in some logos. It also looked great in 2001 - a space oddisey and a number of other scifi movies.

But my task is to make it look good in headlines and short bodytext (payoffs etc) on a fincial website.</div>

Give Eurostile more challenging word images to render and its modular "spikes and boxes" monotony soon starts to choke.

		<div class="commentbody">Context is everything. This maxim was never truer than for logotypes and work marks.

What baffles me most about some typophilers is their black & white, cut 'n dried view of fonts and typography. Some people here are saying Eurostyle always looks bad, no matter what the context, while others insist it always looks good or is at least an inherently good typeface design.

In actuality, it all depends on context, yet if the word content / image is sufficiently demanding, certain fonts don't measure up, pack it in early, show their lack of range and teeth. Microgramma / Eurostile is one such font.

The bold version is partly redeemed from such embarrassment in much the same way as bold Helvetica and Arial.

Ya know't ah mean? Know't ah mean? Eh? Reet! Reet! Erm. . .well actually erm. . .

		<div class="commentbody">A few years ago I did a brand refreshment for a big company that had Eurostile in their CI ([[http://www.lenart.pl/work|here]] and [[http://www.dtp.pl/layoutroku2007/wyniki.asp?id_witryny=94|here]]). With extra effort I think you could achieve some interesting results with lighter weights of the font :)
