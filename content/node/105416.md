body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm new to typography and I'm creating my first font in Fontforge.
  I design the characters illustrator first then import them in to fontforge. \r\n\r\nI
  done the capital letters first and generated them to see what they were like. That
  worked. Then I done the lowercase letters and generated them. that worked as well.
  Then I done a few punctuation characters as well as the space character (8 all together),
  generated them. It didn't work. When I use the font in another software the capital
  and lowercase letters showed up but the 7 punctuations I have done don't show up
  and the space character works but is too big even though I made it half the size
  if font forge.\r\n\r\nI'm getting a bit frustrated because I've tried different
  things to solve the problem and am still getting stuck. If you could help me I would
  really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDave"

    not, your glyphs are not properly named, encoded. They are generated, but are
    not recognized as a comma, a period, a space by any application, not even FontForge.\r\n\r\nHere
    is where the characters should be after you select Encoding &gt; Reencode &gt;

    body: Solved! Thank you so much. I don't know what happened. I must of reencoded
      it by mistake some how. Any way I'm looking forward to get stuck in making my
      own fonts. Thanks a lot once again.
