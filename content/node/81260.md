  specific type of shading treatment on a vast number of logos that I've run across
  and I love it. \r\n\r\nFor clarification purposes, does this specific type of shading
  have a formal name or technique associated with it?\r\n\r\nI've always figured that
  this kind of effect could be done roughly with an algorithm or black and white conversion
  plugin and then fine tuned, rather than entirely hand drawn--but I've never run
  across anything that splits shades of gray into black bars of varying thickness
  like this. \r\n\r\nMight any of you kind folks here on Typophile have any recommendations
  on how to consistently produce this effect?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I have always heard it referred to as a line screen effect. Many years ago,
    Andromeda offered various filter packs for Photoshop, some of which generated
    effects like these automatically, but I suspect that numbers 3 and five above
    were done entirely by hand...

  body: "Oldnick's suggestion of \"line screen\" sounds right, although these logos
    have been tweaked way beyond what you'd get with an automated screen technique
    that you'd apply to a photo or whatever. I'm sure all of those examples were hand
    constructed.\r\n\r\nIt's a style that was very popular once, but to me the technique
    now looks dated. I remember doing similar things back in the 90s."

    and '90 popular graphics - the amiga and commodor, early years of electro, 8bit
    etc.

    Retro graphics and tech logos, it's one of the main reasons why I'm aiming to
    replicate this specific technique. :)\r\n\r\nI think I may have found a really
    solid way to do it using blends and very precisely sized patterns in illustrator.
    I'll post a small how-to if this ends up working out well and you guys are interested
    at all.\r\n\r\n"

  body: When it was most popular, the name for it that I remember was "piano rule",
    because it looks kind of like the black keys on a piano where the lines get thicker.

    quite well, specifically 60 degree diagonals (matches isometric / axonometric
    marks much better) at varying line widths. Much better than trying to finesse
    everything by hand, can also easily preview at varying widths on the fly, etc.\r\n\r\nTransform
    pattern at small increments to line up the bars > expand > clean up.\r\n\r\nInstant
    retro logo!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The technique is called Xylography or Woodcut (German \"Holzstich\").\r\n\r\nIt's
    an old technique in which an image is carved into the surface of a block of wood,
    with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing
    parts are removed. There are different variations that involve different patterns
    and techniques. You can read more about it here:\r\n\r\n:: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylographic\r\n::
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing\r\n\r\nIt's actually a cool technique
    if applied properly. Unfortunately this style got a bad wrap in the late 90s when
    it was widely used and abused through numerous Photoshop filters :-) Hope this
    helps."

  body: The great advantage of this woodcut or piano-keys or whatever you want to
    call it style is that it allows you to use shading and dimension in a logo design
    and potentially still have it come through a fax recognizably, which is a tough
    order for multicolor and even gray tone logos.
