  an existing book design layout (done in in-design CS6) into an e-book for use on
  a Kindle reader?\r\nI have just started reading up on it and realise that I might
  have to change the font/s I have used for the main body of the book and probably
  a whole lot of things. Luckily the book contains no images, but I do want to retain
  page ends so that Chapters start on fresh pages. There is also a bit of text styling
  (custom page numbers, chapter headers etc that may just not be possible on an e-reader.\r\nI
  have been reading about exporting using fixed page layouts (something it seems you
  can only do with Creative Cloud though).\r\n\r\nI am hoping to use the export E-pub
  function (within in-design) in order to create the right file.\r\nI assume this
  leads to a layout which changes size and thus page count, which is fine. But I do
  want to keep the page ends in at the end of chapters.\r\n\r\nAny help would be amazing
  as I am having to fast-track learn this new way of working."
