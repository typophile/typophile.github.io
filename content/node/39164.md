    setting this acronym. Some ampersands look unfortunately too much like an E...
    Such as with Super Duty.... Making the competition appealing to an entirely different

  body: "I truly had to know what D&Ad was all about - and what it really stood for.
    So, I wrote them. I would like to share their response with you.\r\n\r\nDear Jackie,\r\n\r\nWe
    do get asked that a lot.  Officially, the letters \"D&AD\" stand for nothing at
    all.  When it was founded in 1962, D&AD was called the British Designers & Art
    Directors Association.  That name was dropped in favour of D&AD about 5 or 6 years
    ago for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Over the years, the awards have become increasingly
    international - these days 70% of our entries come from outside of the UK - our
    second biggest entrant nation is the US.  \r\n\r\n2) We now support such a wide
    range of creative disciplines that 'designers and art directors' seemed an inaccurate
    title.  We cover 30 different categories in the awards alone, and run education
    & professional development programmes across disciplines.\r\n\r\nWe've been known
    informally as D&AD since our founding, so although we regularly hear the question
    you've just asked, we felt it was the best route to take.\r\n\r\nI hope that clears
    things up - let me know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMaeve\r\n\r\n--\r\nMaeve
    O'Sullivan\r\nSenior Communications Manager\r\nD&AD\r\n9 Graphite Square, Vauxhall
    Walk, London SE11 5EE, United Kingdom\r\nDirect Line - +44 (0)20 7840 1125\r\n\r\nD&AD
    Awards 2008 -  Call for Entries - But is it a Pencil?\r\nVisit http://www.dandad.org/awards08
    for information or to enter. \r\nFinal deadline Wednesday 16 January 2008.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nOn
    another note:\r\nMiss Giggles - have you graduated yet?"
