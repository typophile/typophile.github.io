    body: hi, thanks for your reply, and shame on me should it be so :) but i wonder
      if this really is perpetua? i've been comparing some of the features, and it
      seems that the "A" in my pic has a pointed apex & is wider, whereas Perpetua's
      is flat, the x-height seems to be different, "G" feels heavier in Perpetua &
      less round, Perpetua's "l" ascender terminal is less gradual, etc., etc.? z

  body: "It's definitely a Gill face or the copy of one, but I can't explain the differences
    from Perpetua. It has all the earmarks, such as the f and d. It's also not Golden
    Cockerel. \r\n\r\nWhere does this come from? Is it an engraving, or copy of an
    engraving? Could it be something somebody did following Gill, or an engraving
    that he himself did? \r\n\r\nThis specimen seems like it has bits from different
    sources slapped together--the sans at the top left, the different typeface at
    the top right..."

    body: definitely looks like a fusion of more than one characteristic features,
      that's why i found this face rather intriguing. i do not know who was this caption
      designed by, nor there is any other clue... i only know i took this picture
      in an exhibition at glasgow school of art, a while ago...
