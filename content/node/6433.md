body: The book dedicated to the Helmut Salden&#39;s work is just great. It&#39;s in
  dutch, but 90% of it are good reproductions of his works. So, if you want to see
  one of the higher expressions of lettering and dustjacket design, just get it. <BR>

  body: 'I bought this book last month, at Nijhof &amp; Lee in Amsterdam, and agree
    that it is very fine. I&#39;d never heard of Salden before, but his work is excellent:
    the more remarkable for the difficult circumstances of his life. He fled Germany
    in the 1930s, but was captured and sent to a labour camp after the German occupation
    of The Netherlands. He survived and, after the war, returned to The Netherlands
    where he did some of the best book jacket lettering I&#39;ve seen. But I think
    the best gems are his calligraphic monograms: so perfectly balanced.'
