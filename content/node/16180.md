body: "I just read the Adobe EULA, and it pretty much nixs doing any glyph modification
  to the font. Is there somewhere at Adobe that will do the work? Is there a way to
  get permission to make modifications? Does anyone have any insight to this? I've
  pasted the applicable parts of the EULA below.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n4.2  No Modifications.
  Except as permitted in Section 14.7, you may not modify, adapt or translate the
  Software. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt
  to discover the source code of the Software except to the extent you may be expressly
  permitted under applicable law to decompile only in order to achieve interoperability
  with the Software.\r\n\r\n14.7. Font Software. If the Software includes font software
  --\r\n\r\n14.7.1 You may use the font software with the Software on Computers as
  described in Section 2 and output the font software to any output device(s) connected
  to such Computer(s).\r\n\r\n14.7.2 If the Permitted Number of Computers is five
  or fewer, you may download the font software to the memory (hard disk or RAM) of
  one output device connected to at least one of such Computers for the purpose of
  having the font software remain resident in such output device, and of one additional
  such output device for every multiple of five represented by the Permitted Number
  of Computers.\r\n\r\n14.7.3 You may take a copy of the font(s) you have used for
  a particular file to a commercial printer or other service bureau, and such service
  bureau may use the font(s) to process your file, provided such service bureau has
  a valid license to use that particular font software.\r\n\r\n14.7.4 You may convert
  and install the font software into another format for use in other environments,
  subject to the following conditions: A computer on which the converted font software
  is used or installed will be considered as one of your Permitted Number of Computers.
  Use of the font software you have converted will be pursuant to all the terms and
  conditions of this agreement. Such converted font software may be used only for
  your own customary internal business or personal use and may not be distributed
  or transferred for any purpose, except in accordance with Section 4.4 of this agreement.\r\n\r\n14.7.5
  You may embed copies of the font software into your electronic documents for the
  purpose of printing and viewing the document. If the font software you are embedding
  is identified as \"licensed for editable embedding\" on Adobe\u2019s website at
  http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html, you may also embed copies
  of that font software for the additional purpose of editing your electronic documents.
  No other embedding rights are implied or permitted under this license."

    the <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/pdfs/FontFAQ.pdf\">Adobe
    Font FAQ</a> found on <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/main.html\">this</a>
    page.\r\n\r\n11. Can I customize a font using font manipulation software?\r\nYou
    are allowed to use font manipulation software to modify the font software to produce
    \u201Cderivatives\u201D of fonts licensed from Adobe, as long as you use the derivatives
    in accordance with the same licensing terms that accompany the original fonts.
    For example, you can use Macromedia Fontographer or Pyrus FontLab to customize
    an Adobe Font for individual usage, but you are not permitted to distribute, sell,
    or give away, the derivative work, and the derivative work counts as one of the
    permitted number of uses."

  body: "Hello Highlander\r\n\r\n>Is there somewhere at Adobe that will do the work?\r\n\r\nI
    think you answer your own question there - most foundries invite custom work and
    glyph modifications to their products, as long as they are the ones who are doing
    such work and getting paid for it, and the customer has provided some kind of
    rationale in their commission to have the product modified. Adobe is not likely
    to be an exception to this.\r\n\r\nHave you tried posting your question directly
    to their <a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi/webx?13@@.eea5b3a\">forum?</a>"

  body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nThanks for your input - That seems to answer it. One more
    question, if they clarify this in their FAQ, why doesn't their EULA state this?
    Or is this just another font world querk (I can name a few foundries that do the
    same sort of thing...) Thanks again!"

  body: You have to read the EULA at least 100 times with 30 day breaks in between
    each read. =^P Ok. Just kidding. Adobe gives us the FAQ to clarify what the lawyers
    feel necessary to write. Again, Thomas will hopefully come around and tell all
    of us.

    among type foundries in generally not doing customization work ourselves, and
    also in allowing derivative works as described in the FAQ.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "> I think the EULA and the FAQ between them say it all.\r\n\r\nMy guess is
    that the contradictions between FAQ and EULA are due to the FAQ reflecting an
    old version of the EULA. Tom do you have pointers to Adobe's legacy font EULA's?
    The earliest I can find using WayBack is 2002 and it seems to prohibit mods.\r\n\r\nThe
    language in the FAQ feels a bit antiquated, and I think the FAQ is difficult to
    find on the Adobe site. If I had to give advice to a graphic designer at my company
    I'd have to advise them not to modify any Adobe fonts, despite the FAQ. \r\n\r\nSi\r\n"
