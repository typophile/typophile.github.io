  i believe he was Dutch or Czech, which made an Art Installation with Typographic
  Straight Lineal shapes in black and red in a Parking. The font was quite abstract
  like wim crouwel new alphabet style.\r\n\r\nI believe the guy is well known (won
  a Red Dot Award) but somehow i cannot find any info on him neither i remember his
  name.\r\n\r\nAnybody saw this work?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSebs"
