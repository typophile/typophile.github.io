body: Just upgraded to Panther, but couldn&#39;t find anything on the Extensis site
  &#40;or versiontracker&#41; as to whether Suitcase 10.2.2 will work with Panther.
  <BR> <BR>The Extensis site gives the impression to a casual observer that one has
  to have X1 for Panther. But the present administration has made me more cynical.
  <BR> <BR>Any experiences? <BR> <BR>Victor

    its a piece of crap and, quite frankly, no one really needs font management software.

    works dandy.

    It surely wasn&#39;t my  <BR>intention to jump on you. I have an inkling of a
    clue where this  <BR>all would go, and I sincerely was interested in your opinion.

  body: 'I think the biggest, most important, thing to keep in mind when dealing with
    font management software is that it is fallible. Especially if you really want
    to keep all of your fonts active at once.  <BR> <BR>For instance, I use Suitcase
    X1 and Panther. Most of the time it runs smoothly. I generally only have 10 or
    so fonts active, but I do keep most of my library loaded. Granted I do not use
    the auto-activate. Occasionally Suitcase will decide a font is corrupt. I say
    bollocks to that and under the TOOLS pull-down &#40;after selecting the so-called
    corrupt fonts&#41; I use the &#34;unmark corrupt fonts&#34; and all is well again.
    This is just a little bug. Doesn&#39;t happen often. But I think it is directly
    due to the fact that my library is a little large. '

    <BR>What&#39;s the use of font management software when you do that?

  body: Well, I just threw away 50 bucks, then. Suitcase 10.2 kept choking on fonts
    as I loaded my library, so I figured it was the version -- dumb, right -- went
    ahead and upgraded only to discover that X1 also choked on anything more than
    a few hundred fonts at a time. <BR> <BR>Spent ages waiting on the phone for tech
    support, only to be told that Suitcase should be able to load 15,000 fonts in
    one go. <BR> <BR>&#40;Do they just make this stuff up?&#41; <BR> <BR>Victor

    chokes on y when x can&#39;t get y down its throat.   <BR> <BR>To wit, when adding
    a sizable group of fonts&#42; to the suitcase fonts, either through the Add menu
    command or by drag &#39;n&#39; drop, Suitcase aborts the operation midway through.
    <BR> <BR>&#42;Anything over 400 in a batch, I found. All the fonts had been checked
    over by Font Doctor previously if it makes a difference.'

  body: Ah. That kind of choke. Gotcha. Well, I recall crashing Suitcase when trying
    to drag my entire fonts folder onto it. I soon resorted to simply keeping foundry
    folders in suitcase and dragging them onto suitcase one folder &#40;foundry&#41;
    at a time. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d guess that any font management app would choke on
    too much at once. I&#39;d also wonder if it isn&#39;t more the system choking
    on the app and not the app on the fonts. <BR> <BR>BTW Thanks for the definition

  body: As long as you are not also using Apple&#39;s utilty to load your fonts, you
    should be okay.  The only problem I have on occasion is when I am using a Classic
    App &#40;Quark 4.11&#41; as well as another App using the same font in OSX.  Somehow
    Suitcase X1 will quit on me taking Classic with it &#40;but not crash OSX&#41;.
