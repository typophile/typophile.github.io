  the typefaces used in a book are mentioned in the credits. It gives credit to the
  design and the designer and saves me a lot of Whatthefont sessions ;-) But what
  if one were to use a typeface that has a different name than the original (I'm thinking
  for instance about several Bitstream and URW typefaces that had to change the name
  for copyright purposes). Would you credit it Optus or Optima, Gill Sans or Humanist
  521?"

  body: And would it be legal if you credit Humanist 521 as Gill Sans? Would that
    make it a copyright infringement?

    is a derivative of another typeface or not. There are usually subtle differences
    in the cuts that you don\u2019t want to attribute to the wrong font. Then there
    are more difficult cases of high-quality derivatives that are now just as established
    as the original typeface (such as Sabon based on Garamond).\r\n\r\nI don't think
    you\u2019d be guilty of copyright infringement just by giving the wrong font name,
    but you\u2019d probably do Gill Sans a disservice. If you can\u2019t stand for
    your chosen font, you\u2019d better not name it at all."

  body: "In my view, a typographer's greatest debt is to the type designer, with consideration
    to the type foundry or the rights-holder being only secondary to that.\r\n\r\nIf
    the credit for the typeface is shuffled among the copyright notice and publication
    data, expediency calls for naming the font with precision and accuracy. For example,
    <em>Set in Humanist 521,</em> as the case may be.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you can
    afford the luxury of including a colophon (let us call the thing by its name),
    then you have ample room to give the original name of the face, its designer and
    history, and, lastly, which foundry released the version used here, and when.\r\n\r\nYour
    question is not one of legality, but ethics. Which formulation pays the greatest
    respect to the type designer, without lying to the typophile?"

  body: "Christopher,\r\n\r\nI agree with you that the Colophon option would be best.
    I didn't consider the differences in the cuts. Accuracy is important. I have a
    book credited as 'set in 11 pt Garamond', but more accurately it is set in ITC
    Garamond. This makes quite a difference..."

  body: I've seen a few Colophons in which the typeface is mentioned by name, with
    an addition of which historical font it was inspired by. I see no reason why one
    couldn't do the same thing for a font inspired by a more recent typeface.
