    be the placement of and the 'naive' looking typeface used for your name. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    the Kilo logo turend out nicely (I remember seeing in the critique section before)
    - well done!"

    lightbox a fixed height and keep the buttons at the same position.\r\n"

  body: "Definitely agree with the last post. That problem could be solved by putting
    it at the top.\r\n\r\nI like your MK monogram a lot but don't think it connects
    all that well with the font for your name (Helvetica?) on the site. Given what
    I've seen you can do, I think you could have more fun with your name - it's the
    least interesting part of the site. Also the navigation at the top - have you
    tried a more interesting html font for that?\r\n\r\nWill you expand to the right
    or down as you add more work or will you keep it a small number to fit in  your
    design?"

  body: "Thanks for the positive feedback everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm actually using thickbox
    for the portfolio bit, I liked lightbox but thickbox is a bit quicker and the
    next/prev buttons are always there (as opposed to lightbox which has hidden buttons
    that appear on mouseover). I'll see if I can get them into a fixed position (moving
    it to the top is a good suggestion). \r\n\r\nMy name is set in AG Old Face - Shaded.
    I thought it worked well with the site but maybe I should reconsider if it's considered
    too plain. Though I don't necessarily want to use a real attention getting/loud
    font.   \r\n\r\nPatty, when I get enough work I plan to categorize it into small
    galleries... but for the time being one page is better. Another way is keep the
    same format but when there's more have a link to a next page. \r\n\r\nAlso, I
    have not tried any other fonts for the navigation-- what do you mean by more interesting?
    Given the limited choices that is... would you say something like Verdana is more
    interesting? I'm not sure. \r\n"

  body: "I meant perhaps either a simple sans like Verdana or a more modern looking
    pixel font like the one you use at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI don't think moving it
    onto a 'next' page is so great - I prefer the idea of organizing it into galleries."
