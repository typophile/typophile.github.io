body: "I\u2019ve been using Relato Sans for a technology client, but it turns out
  it doesn\u2019t have the necessary superscript I need for setting chemical formulas.
  I\u2019ve contacted Eduard Manso about this, with no response yet. Another issue
  is that I hope to license some inhouse fonts for the client, but most type designers
  don\u2019t prepare their fonts for use in Microsoft Office and it\u2019s likes.
  I\u2019ll need a basic style linked set, diacritics that doesn\u2019t disappear
  and preferably some hinting for Windows users. I\u2019ve seen FF\u2019s Offc library,
  but none of those resembles Relato\u2019s style.\r\n\r\nRelato Sans is somewhat
  squarish, which is part of the reason I chose it, so something along those lines
  is what I\u2019m looking for. I also think it would benefit from rather short descenders,
  as I know it will mainly be used at quite large and very small sizes.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?"

    that many foundries will do custom style-linking on fonts licensed from them either
    for free or for a smallish fee, so maybe that doesn't need to constrain your selection."

  body: "Thanks, Nina. Fedra is not to squarish, no. For some wierd reason it doesn\u2019t
    strike me as very techy. Maybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019ve seen it used in
    different settings."

  body: "My last post implied the font needs to be very techy, which isn\u2019t quite
    right. The company is developing green technology and I think something softer
    would work too."

    I\u2019ll take a closer look."
