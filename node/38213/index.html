Wim Crouwell is known for doing awesome stuff with grids, including grid based lettering, and there are some great interviews with him on YouTube, as well as in Helvetica: The Film.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Koppa&rsquo;s reply is the best answer (and a wonderfully bizarre photo of Tschichold). I would add Jost Hochuli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Layout&rdquo; is such a broad term – do you mean books? magazines? web pages? Even if you&rsquo;re talking about books, there&rsquo;s huge variety, from a well-made novel (the sort of page that makes you want to read the text, and gets out of your way while you do so) to an art book or a complex integration of visuals and text.</p>
<p>One of the finest practitioners of page design working today is Jack Stauffacher. His sense of the relationships between elements, and how they&rsquo;ll be perceived by the reader, is very highly developed. The results are subtle, not obvious.</p>
