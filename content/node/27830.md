  release</A>, pointing to this <A HREF=\"http://www.babyshere.com/politicalcards.html\">site
  </A> hosting \"political\" birth announcements - reminded me why we live in the
  greatest democracy on earth (specifically \"Details such as font and color can be
  customized as well\"), but also reminded me that I need to get started on an announcement
  card for the new baby boy we're expecting in a couple of weeks. \r\n\r\nInterested
  in what typographers on the list may have sent out in the past, and any other ideas.
  \r\n\r\nCheers, Si  \r\n"

    typographers on the list may have sent out in the past\"\r\n\r\nFor our first
    baby, I got some gMund paper, letterpressed the announcement, cut rounded corners,
    and mailed them out.\r\n\r\nFor our second baby, I sent everyone an email with
    a link to Flickr. ;)"

    brothers" and one "big sister". He was doomed from the start ;-)
