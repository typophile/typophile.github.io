    links to these sites out of the forums, that is why I have edited your post. \r\n\r\nWe
    most definitely encourage people to make the community aware of font piracy, but
    we'd rather not become the starting point for people to access these sites.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Zara speaks the truth. And the foundries are aware of this particular site.
    In the future if anyone has information about a site that is sharing fonts and
    you know they shouldn't be it is better to contact the foundries directly or you
    can email one of the moderators and we will pass the information along to the
    appropriate people.

    days are covered there too, should be easy to find.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the prosecutors
    don't have a chance. If TPB is found guilty, then any other search engine is at
    fault for the exact same reasons. RIAA/MPAA's only argument is that TPB doesn't
    cooperate with them in removing \"unwanted material\" (while Google allegedly
    does), but until there's a law that tells TPB to do that, they are in the clear.\r\n\r\nIt's
    really interesting how all this plays out."

    going to get a lot more interesting when the Swedes find out what it\u2019s like
    to be a first-world nation getting third-world-dictator trade deals because the
    US, Canada, and the rest of Western Europe get sick of Sweden harboring the Pirate
    Bay. Russia caved on pirate sites and they have huge stocks of oil and natural
    gas to leverage. How long does the Swedish parliament think that everyone is going
    to play these games with them?"

  body: "> Russia caved on pirate sites \r\n\r\nI can assure you that this is simply
    not true. Even the closure of the infamous allofmp3.com was a staged farce. It
    was closed alright, but it reopened under a different name in A DAY and it is
    still in operation.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that bulling Sweden or shutting down
    TPB won't help the cause. The technology is out of the bottle and it effectively
    invalidated established licensing methods. There is simply no going back to the
    old ways. That's pretty much like giving people a taste of driving a car and then
    forcing them back on a donkey. It ain't going to work, scaremongering or not."

    eventually become a diplomatic circus as everyone else tries to figure out what
    to do about it."

    someday we will run out of oil. We will probably need to find an alternative.
    So I'm not sure about that analogy. ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, just because something
    is being pirated, doesn't mean that EVERYONE will go running to get pirated wares,
    digital or not. In New York City, I see people selling pirated DVDs and knock-off
    items all the time, but the bona fide items also do good business."
