  this design done for a college event. It&#39;s an ambigram that reads mechanics
  on one side and paradise the other way.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering how the design
  stands typographically &#40;I&#39;m a complete amateur to typography&#41;, and would
  definitely welcome all comments/suggestions, especially if it would enhance legibility.

  <BR> <BR> <BR>For convenience, the design maps this way: <BR>&#39;m&#39; on &#39;dise&#39;
  <BR>&#39;e&#39; on &#39;a&#39; <BR>&#39;ch&#39; on &#39;r&#39; <BR>&#39;a&#39; on
  &#39;a&#39; <BR>&#39;nics&#39; on &#39;p&#39;'

  body: I think your design would be helped by making a consistent x-height, using
    a kind of blackletter style with thick and thin strokes and reduce the swashes
    to the minimum needed. You have a difficult task making the m from 4 letters it
    leaves p with too much work, try to develop the m from se. <BR>Tim

  body: I&#39;m not too crazy about the swashes myself, so I&#39;m trying to get rid
    of as many swashes as possible. They were supposedly there to compensate for a
    very inconsistent baseline. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tweaked the design some more, reduced
    the swashes, with what I hope is a much more consistent x-height, and now it looks
    like this:<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68120.png" alt="second
    design"> <BR> <BR>It seems better to me now, though &#34;paradise&#34; still leaves
    much to be desired. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s an improvement, anyhow. I&#39;ll
    see how it turns out with a different type of blackletter, but that&#39;ll take
    some time, as I&#39;m pretty clumsy with manipulating bezier curves.
