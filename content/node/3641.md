    PFA do you?

    PFM file to your Windows Fonts folder. If there is no PFM file but there are AFM
    and INF files, download ATM 4.1 Light and use it to install the font.  <BR> <BR>If
    you&#39;re on Windows 98/ME, download ATM 4.1 Light and use it to install the
    font.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Otherwise, you can use TransType 2 by Fontlab Ltd. to convert the font
    to Windows TTF:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/transtype.html"
