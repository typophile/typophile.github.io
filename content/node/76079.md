body: "Hey folks\r\n\r\nWould like to get some alternative style ideas on drop caps;
  they only appear once per page of a brochure, so it can become a feature in itself.
  Any input on positioning/height, how many lines to drop, etc would be much appreciated.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jdropcap_3616.PNG]"

    so don't freak out about the size of the thing; it's over two meters across!\r\n\r\nI
    have no grid employed for each page. I'm trying to avoid that as I will need to
    alter it somewhat before I even do a prelim print...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mash_5382.jpg]\r\n\r\n"
