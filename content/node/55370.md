body: "Kristen Nikosey is a graphic designer that I have recently come across and
  have enjoyed. Her work shows influence by impressionist paintings and pattern designs.
  By looking at her work I began to notice that she would sign all her illustrations
  as if it was a painting, then I came to realize it was a painting. She would paint
  traditionally on canvas then formatted them to illustrations digitally. This I found
  interesting because I thought the acrylic paint gave the illustrations extra texture.
  You can also see her illustrations on products under her studio link displayed on
  her website. \r\nCheck it out.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kristennikosey.com/index.htm\r\n\r\n"
