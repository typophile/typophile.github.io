  body: "EDITED:\r\nLooks like an outdoor sign.\r\nMy guess is that it's not a font
    as such, but rather sign-maker's lettering.\r\nThe effect could be duplicated
    with a fairly heavy, monoline, boxy or gas-pipe style wide sans. For example Valfle
    Extended [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ValfleExtended_MHS_5668.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/vafle/\r\nI
    trust a kindly typophile could recommend something that is a better match.\r\nFor
    the _M_ and _H_ paste on small Clarendon style serifs.\r\nAs for the the _S_ the
    paste could consist of the serif and terminal treatment from any of several \"wild
    west\" wood type designs.\r\nGood choices include Jeff Levine's Saddle Tramp JNL
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SaddleTrampJNL_S_5551.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/saddle-tramp/\r\nEqually
    suitable, Blackoak \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Blackoak_S_6709.gif]
    already suggested by Kevin.\r\nIn both of these cases some tinkering would be
    needed to get the terminal to match.\r\nDon"

  body: Thank you very much for your input. It is indeed an outdoor banner from Malibu
    High School. When I did a Google image search, it came up with three different
    typefaces for MHS. It appears MHS does not employ a graphic standards manual.
