body: "This is a skateboard I made to be donated for silent auction at the Maven skate
  shop in Burlington. The show was to benefit a local skate park. This skateboard
  was inspired by my love of words, type, minimalism, and color. I apologize for the
  quality of the imagine and how hard it is to read, it says HATE in bold Helvetica
  capitals. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EliJager_5377.jpg]"
