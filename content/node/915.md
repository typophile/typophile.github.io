  Isfahan &#40;the font names on this CD are sometimes a pun on the original typefaces&#39;
  names&#41;. <BR> <BR>As mentioned prior, there are 500 fonts on the CD and I&#39;ve
  ID&#39;d almost all of them as clones of still available commercial fonts and old
  time shareware fonts. I just identified another today, so I&#39;m down to 6 fonts
  that I cannot place and kind of like. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14124.gif"

  body: Mike,  <BR>This time I can&#39;t help you any more than to say that I have
    seen this called &#34;Highbrow&#34; in a NovelFonts collection sold as the &#34;Expresiv
    Ornate Font Collection&#34;. I have identified the real names of most fonts in
    that collection, but this isn&#39;t one of them that I was able to find anywhere
    else.

  body: 'Koala doesn&#39;t have the hand drawn eccentricities, but the general letterforms
    are quite similar. <BR> <BR>Actually, every time I look at this font, the less
    I like it. Those eccentricities seem to have been thrown in randomly for a few
    letters '
