  feature would be the slanted lower-case e. The B's are also worth looking at, but
  otherwise, I'm finding it really difficult to find the name of the font. It's definitely
  out there, as this image was made in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nPlease help! Thank you.\r\n\r\nNevermind,
  got the font name. It's Bellerose."
