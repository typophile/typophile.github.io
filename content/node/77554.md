  body: "It looks like they're using the GD library, if that wasn't glaringly obvious.\r\n\r\nYou
    could cut out the work of drawing the grid and glyph-name characters by creating
    your own image, opening it and drawing the glyph set onto it.\r\n\r\nI believe
    GD lib works with .otf and .ttf and unicode, but check the documentation! If you
    need UTF-8 you may be out of luck."

  body: FontForge can print text to an image, as can ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick.
    I think all of them use FreeType. Haven't checked if netpbm can. Have totally
    no idea of PHP's capabilities in that regard.

  body: I assumed GD and php, imagemagick is very slow when working with type to image.
    My concern is how can you "query" the font per say, like opentype, and show all
    the glyphs. I was thinking some sort of for each loop of unicode values, but not
    sure.

  body: Showing Opentype glyphs is extremely difficult. Showing glyphs that have Unicode
    points, not so much. Just use FontForge to determine what glyphs are available
    in a font and then send that to your image script.

  body: Yeah, I haven't seen any GD code yet that works with Glyph ids, only unicode
    and char#s. Also, never thought of using fontforge with this, thought it might
    only confuse things, hehe.

  body: "BTW, fontaine is nice but seems it returns a bit too much info, and does
    not really return just a listing of the actual glyphs in the font. \r\n\r\nFontforge,
    I cannot get it to communicate with php via the command prompt, seems beter for
    a GUI environment like osx/windows.\r\n\r\nKeep going in circles with freetype
    and php/gd, but I did stumble across the Open Font Library charmap open source
    script (http://trac.openfontlibrary.org/browser/selapa?rev=319), but cannot get
    it to output based on the idea above. So, after a few days of dead ends, I think
    its time to start early and go into a New Years Eve drinking binge...  ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: The FontForge docs (on Sourceforge) are more hacker-friendly than user-friendly,
    but if you dig and sift through the the files on scripting, you should find what
    you need. It's mainly on its native scripting language, but there are also some
    details on Python scripting.

  body: After a little break, I revisited this. Using Fontaine worked quite nice,
    its the only thing I have seen so far that can read both TTF and OTF very clean.
    Once I got the JSON output filtered, you can pluck out the JSON values you would
    like, very nice. But, this hasn't helped me much on the character map idea, at
    this point I might go exploring some outside coders to finish it. Not sure how
    GD and PHP only can display this idea (as mentioned above). Maybe with truetype
    files, but I cannot see just those two alone being able to display opentype glyph
    tables. You guys at fontsquirrel must be pulling some crazy GD/PHP trickery.

    impossible with the software as is without hacking the font itself.

  body: "<cite> ... without hacking the font itself.</cite>\r\n\r\nDo you mean, without
    setting valid Unicode points to each and every single glyph? I've written a small
    utility to output the <em>character map</em> of an OTF font into a text file,
    but it's of no use for glyphs. (JSON is not in my list of output options, but
    it could be added, were I inclined to.)\r\n\r\nUsing FreeType, it <em>should</em>
    be possible to write a C program to output an image alike the sample, but containing
    <em>all</em> glyphs, so it's probably possible with PHP as well.\r\n\r\n See <a
    href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/52647\">my SeeFont</a>, for example; a thin
    Windows wrapper around FreeType, not limited to showing just Unicode characters."

  body: "I think this is very interesting, considering opentype has been out for quite
    some time now, yet the GD/PHP setup still does not support it fully when we discuss
    things like above. Just look at the php calls, they all start with TTF, strange
    considering you now have so much moving into @font-face world, or maybe not so
    strange. \r\n\r\nI hope someone picks up the ball and updates this in the near
    future. The idea of using fontforge to convert files to ttf, then read that out
    is nasty, nasty and more nasty...but then again, you gotta do what you gotta do?

  body: "Small update. Still working away on this, seems to get php to read an otf
    file (even just extended latin chars) is not possible. But if the font is in ttf
    format, then it will display all the items (minus opentype extras). So, just getting
    say like the Euro symbol to show in php with the built in fucntions of imagettftext
    will not output via otf correctly, you would need to convert the otf to ttf first.\r\n\r\nStill
    made no ground on getting the opentype features to show yet, such as salts and
    swash, etc.  \r\n\r\nBut I think there is some misleading info about php/gd is
    all you need, sure. But I am not seeing php/gd even read the extended items of
    OTF files correctly, tried numerous ways to send the unicode values into php,
    no dice.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has done this (contradicting above), feel free to share..

    working (limited) by using TTX/Fonttools to export the font data to XML. The only
    issue now, is I still cannot get it to dump the opentype extras (eg: salt) into
    an charmap image, mainly because of the unicode missing issue. \r\n\r\nAny ideas
    oh how to use say fontforge or something in conjunction here to apply unicode
    values onto the extra opentype options?"
