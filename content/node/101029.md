body: "So, this might have been discussed before, or it might be really far out there,
  but I thought about it and thought I'd get some input. \r\n\r\nIn the era of metal
  type different sizes had different qualities. Especially didot-faces were adjusted
  between sizes, something that poses some difficulties using digital didot amongst
  sizes. When Monokrom launched their foundry, their catalogue had both Satyr and
  Faunus, which is the same face made for different uses. Text size and medium size.
  Would this be possible to implement in a font technology? Or would it just be a
  huge pain in the ass for type designers, not worth it, technically impossible etc?
  I'm talking about an automated process where the form of the font would adjust to
  the size set in the software. So, if I chose satyr in 10/12pt it would display as
  satyr and if I increased the size to 18/20 it would switch to what Monokrom calls
  faunus?\r\n\r\nJust a thought ;)\r\n\r\nhttps://monokrom.no/catalogue"

    already is. There is an OpenType feature called SIZE that is supposed to select
    a font from a family based on the type size. \r\n\r\n<cite>So, if I chose satyr

    feature never caught on. There is little advantage for word processing and layout
    apps, where people make many conscious decisions about the typeface and their
    appearance anyway. Why not let them make that choice? It saves one click. So what?
    It might even lead to results the user doesn't want or doesn't expect. \r\n\r\nSuch
    features might make more use when text is displayed on electronic devices in various
    formats and sizes. But there it is also already possible. On my blog I use a display
    typeface for headlines, but when the size of the screen is small (like on mobile
    phones) I use CSS media queries to replace the display font with a more robust
    typeface. Same idea. But doesn't need the SIZE feature or any other new technology. "

  body: The existing OpenType 'size' feature is a hack, and its no surprise that after
    fifteen years there is still almost no software that supports it. It involves
    co-opting the data structure of the GPOS table to store non-GPOS data about intended
    size range of a font. It requires a layout engine to access this odd GPOS feature
    prior to font selection; whereas normally GPOS features are the last things applied
    in layout. Everyone I've spoken to at Microsoft and Adobe agrees that this feature
    is a non-starter; what I've yet to get them to agree on is what should replace
    it.

    TT has no provision for using points in calculations, as in, \"this is 9 point
    so do something special.\" We, and others make assumptions based on pixels per
    em, but 18 of them could be 6 pt, 12 pt or 18 and the hints would never know."

    I'm not sure if you're for or against the idea, but: to me you don't want a reader
    determining too many things for the same reason you don't want a driver determining

  body: "<cite>I'm not sure if you're for or against the idea</cite>\r\n\r\nDepends.
    When a family has display and body styles, the user can just select them. I don't
    see much benefit in automating this step. In the same way as I don't expect my
    app to automatically switch to old-style figures in copy text and tabular figures
    when I type in a table. These kind of automatic changes would probably be more
    confusing than helpful. \r\nOn the other hand: When I think of the Adobe type
    families where different weights & widths are multiplied with up to 4 optical
    sizes, then this can create simply too much choice for the regular font user.
    Here an automatic style change or maybe simply a different style menu could help.
    But then again, such type families are so rare, I don't think it\u2019s worth
    to push such possibilities just for a few font families. "

    with discrete size masters, are a compromise subset of a font that contains, or
    contained, indiscreet outlines, gx variations, plain matching masters, multiple
    masters, whatever was used to capture a range of sizes, widths, weights or contrasts.
    \r\n\r\nFont publishers like myself would rather not publish a font for each and
    every point size, weight, width or PX size to satisfy the needs of e.g. print
    or responsive media. and, i think apps and font formats won't make way. Understanding
    all the intelligence in and around the use of a size range of typecases is simply
    too much for modern engineering.\r\n"

    the selection of a display versus a text cut of a typeface, for most people; but
    for \"power users\" (usually graphic designers well versed in typography) let
    them deviate from the default method (or even change the default behavior). Also,
    I would say there are changes that are subtle enough (such as an increase in stroke
    contrast for a display cut) to be worth quietly automating, versus more structural

  body: "@bbg: certainly any hinting decisions are based on ppm, not pt, but I don't
    see that as an issue, it's probably a better determiner than pt size. \r\nObviously
    thing like shrinking serifs to nil below certain sizes is easily done. \r\nBut
    beyond that, it's technically possible to include 2 sets of outlines in each glyph
    and let the hints choose which one to use based on ppm size. However it's a lot
    of work, writing the functions to do that. And more to the point, it's not valuable
    nowadays as many OS's would throw away your hints. "
