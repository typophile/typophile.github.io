  body: "This has come up before .. but...\r\n\r\nThe top looks like a typeface used
    by Duchamp for \xBB La mariee mise a nu par ses celibataires meme \xAB <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/images/collection/FullSizes/00093022.jpg\">Link</a>
    recently re-brought to life by <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Designers/Jonathan+Hares/\">Jon
    Hares</a> see also the SCHNITTPUNKT identity by Elektrosmog http://www.esmog.org\r\n\r\nThe
    bottom is a modified version of the Tate typeface by <a href=\"http://www.practise.co.uk/work/2003/olafur-eliasson.html\">Practise</a>\r\n\r\nNot,
    that any of that gets you any closer to an alternative.. Especially if you want
    one not so modular / \"tech-y\", and not Moreys Frieze. Sorry."
