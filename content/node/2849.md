  body: Matt, the thing that really sets this face apart for me is the curved top
    stroke of the &#39;a&#39;. I&#39;d like to see this closed semi-circular stroke
    used throughout the characters that warrant it - such as the &#39;g&#39;, &#39;j&#39;,
    &#39;y&#39; and the new &#39;z&#39;. If you leave the curved stroke open in these
    characters, then the &#39;a&#39; should be treated similarly. <BR> <BR>And I really
    didn&#39;t mind the original &#39;z&#39;. Keep it as an alternate.

    for the upper case, I&#39;m trying to decide whether to go traditional with the

    legible/readable.'

    I&#39;m glad you closed the g, y and z ... the p looks a little uptight now, but
    i guess if you are using only certain shapes this is a better alternative. The
    d is nice as well, although it seems a little exaggerated. <BR> <BR>nice name.

    the other weights/alternates. Thanks for the inputs for the input'

    that wasn&#39;t roman or traditional. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see a reason for which
    you should worry about doing a thing &#34;too this&#34; or &#34;too that&#34;.
    What makes a rivisitation of an historical form interesting is what you add/subtract/modify,
    more than what you &#34;preserve&#34; or &#34;redo&#34;, in my opinion. <BR> <BR>For
    this reason, I find the original z less traditional and thus more appropriate
    to be used as the main z &#40;with some adjustment, maybe&#41;. The new d, g,
    p and y are great. <BR> <BR>Be careful with the alternate f: it can be easily
    mistaken for a long s. <BR> <BR>I would definitely try stranger forms, anyway
