  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am doing some research for an article on punctuation, more specifically on the question mark and the exclamation mark.  <BR> <BR>What I know so far is that the question mark first appeared on some manuscripts as early as the seventh and eighth centuries. I have also seen a printed sample from the 15th century &#40;1495&#41; that has a small question mark. I am also aware that by the end of the 18th century the rules of modern English punctuation were more or less established.  <BR> <BR>What I am really interested in finding out is if the original use of the marks was the same as it is today, and how the shape of the marks developed. &#40;In some ways the shape of the question mark is similar to an inverted semicolon, a mark, seen in the 8th century, used to mark a pause halfway between the comma and semicolon.&#41; <BR> <BR>I was wondering if someone could recomend sources, or possible places to start researching the origin of the shapes of these marks and the original meaning they might have had.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One very valuable book here is &#34;Pause and effect: an introduction to the history of punctuation in the West&#34; by M B Parkes &#40;thanks to John Downer for mentioning it on the TD list a while back&#41;. I once copied some short sections of it - here&#39;s some stuff: <BR>- The exclamation mark first appeared in the second half of the 14th century. <BR>- The book doesn&#39;t give a firm date about the first appearance of the question mark &#40;except to say that the Castillian practice of a leading inverted question mark started in the 18th century&#41;, but it seems to imply that it was during the middle ages. <BR>- An interesting aside: there was once a special question mark for rhetorical questions - one flipped horizontally &#40;&#34;facing&#34; right instead of left&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, I remember some Typo-L members once pointing out that the exclamation comes from the two cap letters &#34;I&#34; and &#34;O&#34;, while the question mark comes from &#34;Q&#34; and &#34;O&#34;? Not sure. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Dyana, that book sounds interesting! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Karen, thanks. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s right etiquette. <BR> <BR>In my book, anything from a totally public discussion group &#40;like Typo-L&#41; is always fair game. And if you&#39;re close enough to a given person to know if he&#39;d mind or not, and you think he wouldn&#39;t, then anything that&#39;s most probably not very private &#40;like a general-interest post on the ATypI list&#41; is fine too. Formal protocol isn&#39;t very human. <BR> <BR>&#62; it was a rhetorical question in Arabic <BR> <BR>:-&#62; <BR>Hmmm. If a phrase in Arabic with some intermixed English &#40;at the end?&#41; ends in a flipped question mark, is it rhetorical or not? What if the last thing in the phrase is an Arabic &#40;I mean Arabic Arabic&#41; number? And since we don&#39;t have the luxury of using a flipped question mark here, could <i>those</i> be rhetorical questions? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
