  \ I have a whole bunch of random versions & am trying to purchase a complete family.\r\n\r\nThe
  body weight I like that I have reads as Eurostile Regular, and says it is an open
  type font.  But I don't have an italic version of it.\r\n\r\nLooking on Adobe and
  a couple other sites the lightest I can find is called Eurostile Medium.  \r\n\r\nThis
  seems too heavy for my needs unless it is just a different name for the same font.\r\nI
  gave up waiting on hold for AAdobe to answer that question.\r\n\r\nWhere can I find
  a good true version of Eurostile that includes a regular weight & the corresponding
  italic.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    subsequently released oblique companions.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/\">URW's
    Eurostile</a> is relatively well-drawn, and has a fairly full complement of obliques
    as well as other variations. It's also less expensive (per face) than many of
    its competitors.\r\n\r\nRecently released, <a href=\"http://typophile.com\">Linotype's
    Eurostile Next</a> (redrawn by Akira Kobayashi from Alessandro Butti's and Aldo
    Novarese's originals) also looks promising, although it seems to lack the obliques.\r\n\r\nDavid

  body: "Definitely go for Eurostile Next:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/5324/eurostilenext.html\r\n\r\nThe
    reason for which Akira Kobayashi did not include an Oblique is very simple: Eurostile
    was never conceived as a \"calligraphy based\" typeface. It derived from the previous
    Microgramma (designed in the early 1950s by Alessandro Butti as an all-caps typeface
    for very small point sizes), and Novarese consciously developed the idea, strictly
    connected with a perception of modernity which put out of the question the inclusion
    of an \"Italic\".\r\nSo, I guess all the Oblique versions you find around are
    hacking its essence, and Linotype's version is probably the first to get rid of
    the clutter and to offer it in an authentically \"filologic\" digital form."

  body: Ah, despite what Linotype affirms, strictly speaking Microgramma is not Eurostile,
    the latter simply evolved from the first. Microgramma continued to exist in the
    Nebiolo catalog in lead up to the early 1970s, and it was available just for the
    small point sizes, for which it was designed.
