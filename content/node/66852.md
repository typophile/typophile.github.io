    if there is a good way to use lots of fonts on one page, this is it!\r\nIt's to
    my shame that I can't readily name any of them, though. I'm certain portions,
    if not the entirety, were hand-engraved, but using some published guide as an
    example."

  body: "Thanks for all of your help. Great resources! I have gone through many books
    at archive.org. Love it!\r\n\r\nAny further assistance would be appreciated IDing
    these fonts. I have the blackletter for fantastiques but am still struggling to
    find the others (or close representations).\r\n\r\nThe books are archive.org have
    these flourishes and rules as well. I'm curious if there is a resource for a vector
    version of these kinds of flourishes in this style somewhere? I have found several
    flourishes around but none in this style.\r\n\r\nThanks."
