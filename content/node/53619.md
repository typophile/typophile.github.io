  and The French Quarter, but what about those typefaces? You know, all of those wonderful
  and often hand drawn works of art that provide our city with that rustic, vintage
  feel that we all know and love.\r\n\r\nAs I walked down Magazine St. I noticed that
  there truly is beauty all around us, and for the most part, it's right above our
  heads. The Typefaces that characterize this city are truly one of a kind. They vary
  from the bright and ornate all the way down to the dull and distressed. Who would
  have known the impact of type on a city like New Orleans would be so essential.
  Just picture all of the Signage in New Orleans being in Helvetica or Baskerville,
  how boring would that be?\r\n\r\nLooking into the New Orleans Signage inspired me
  to look into the typefaces of other places, just to compare and contrast. Looking
  at surrounding cities like the Baton Rouge and Laplace, you really begin to notice
  the dramatic differences. The signage in these other places, as I have noticed,
  is all very manufactured. There doesn't appear to be nearly as much hand drawn type
  or the freshness of creativity, at all. \r\n\r\nMaybe there is something to be said
  about cities with intense culture. Perhaps the signage in places like Chicago, New
  York or Los Angeles are as powerful and essential as that in New Orleans. Until
  I find out for myself, I am going to believe that New Orleans is an incredibly magical
  place, unlike no other, signage and all!\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the interesting
  things that I found, these are my personal favorites from my adventure into the
  city. \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0056_5718.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0057_3912.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0058_5248.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0059_5864.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0061_6411.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0064_4921.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0067_3874.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0068_6148.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0069_6561.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0073_5506.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0077_5491.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0083_6576.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0087_4482.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0098_4943.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0085_3512.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0103_5422.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0102_6252.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0100_6672.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0086_4025.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0117_5320.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0070_4002.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0075_6459.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0096_3655.JPG]"
