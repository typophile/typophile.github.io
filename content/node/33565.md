body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI love to express how much I hate certain fonts, but I've never
  done one myself until now. I can now say I hate my \"c\", my \"s\", the dot on my
  \"i\", the kerning and the belly of the \"b\" and \"p\". I also strongly dislike
  the \"a\", and don't really enjoy the general widths of the typography. But I think
  this could be a very nice thing if worked out correctly. I tried to stick to certain
  principles, but the result is less than satisfying. Now is your turn to critique
  it, but I'd prefer some constructive criticism :P\r\n\r\ncheers, and thanks!\r\n.rob"

  body: "Hi .rob\r\n\r\nthe weight of the font varies too much, the f is too thick,
    i reckon.\r\nif the b and p will stay this way the q will get weird as it is now.\r\n\r\ni
    kinda like the little pointy things, in a weird way but maybe they all should
    follow the direction of the letter as a sort of stroke-end\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\nps.
    is this a display font?\r\n"

  body: "I like the idea, I think it has a lot of potential. Here's some thoughts,
    though (in no particular order). \r\n\r\nThe k looks almost tilted or bent due
    to the changing proportions of the different elements.\r\n\r\nI agree on your
    i and j, you need a new dot. maybe a rectangle like so...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nil_6583.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    like the proportions of the q best, maybe mirror that for the a,b,d and p?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks for your feedback! I was originally aiming to make it a very light
    font, for both print and display, but I found out the serifs were really tough
    to do with that. I'll try to make some progress with the intention of releasing
    it as a CC font. Any thoughts regarding that?\r\n\r\n.rob"
