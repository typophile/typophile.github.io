    body: "Thanks DPape! It is close indeed, I had thought Mercury Display also. If
      it is Mercury it has definitely been customised. Still eager to explore the
      possibility that it is another font, particularly for the \"R\" treatment. \r\n\r\nThe
      sans (within the boxes) is somewhat clearer in the additional attached images.
      The numbers may add some clues to what the sans font is.\r\n\r\nAny further
      possibilities out there? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    is Mercury Display (modified), and that the other typefaces on that design are
    Bodoni MT Condensed (Tygodnik Lisickiego) and Cambria Regular for the story blurbs
    (he didn't mention the sans for the numbers, but Klavika appears to be right).\r\n\r\nI
    didn't ask him about the sans nameplate design."
