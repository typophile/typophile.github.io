body: "I think that this is right forum to post this little announcement: we just
  released new product, named <a href=\"http://www.pyrus.com/Font-tools/FogLamp/\">FogLamp</a>.
  It is very simple application which has only one purpose: convert Fontographer database
  files (versions 3 and 4 are supported) to FontLab files.\r\n\r\nFogLamp is available
  separately (for both platforms) and in bundles with Fontographer and TransType Pro.
  Combination of Fog, FogLamp and TransType Pro allows to build Fog-based font-editing
  environment which can generate OpenType fonts in both \"flavors\" as well as any
  other font format.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nMore information is available in <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/The-News/Announcements/FogLamp-for-Fontographer-Users\">press
  release</a>."

    can convert .fog files into .vfb with increased precision up to 10,000 UPM. Useful
    when making complex ornaments, logos, signatures, Baroque initials.</em>\r\n\r\nWill
    the finished fonts be rendered at 10,000 UPM, or will rounding occur to PS and/or
    TTF standards when the fonts are generated?"

    you do the finishing :) \r\n\r\nFrom FontLab, you can output a font with any UPM
    up to 16,000. For TrueType / OpenType TT, it will work perfectly, for OpenType
    PS and Type 1, there will be some minor application-specific annoyances e.g. the
    text cursor in InDesign might shrink to half or quarter size but the font still
    works. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
