  is based on a real non-connected handwriting, with an angle to the left. The typeface
  is designed for optimal readability in small sizes but also works well in larger
  sizes. The family includes seven weights from Light to Black with an extended (Latin)
  character set. OpenType features include slashed zero and alternative shapes for
  the f and fi ligature.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nDISCOUNT\r\nTo
  celebrate the release of Aniek and because it\u2019s summer, we give a 50% discount
  on the Aniek family package and the two smaller packages.\r\nThis offer is valid
  during the entire summer of 2009!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.caketype.com/type/aniek\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nBest
  wishes,\r\nPieter van Rosmalen\r\nhttp://www.caketype.com"
