    \r\nBut the _3_ is round top, which does not match Walbaum. \r\nAlso the Italic
    _4_ has a gap in the upright stroke, which does not match Walbaum [img:sites/default/files/old-images/WalbaumRoman_Italic4_4797.gif]\r\nTodays
    trivia:\r\nWalbaum numbers were very popular for clock face-plates during the

  body: "All of the regular numbers seem to match an Intertype font called Waverley
    (1941).  I don't have a sample for Waverley Italic.\r\nJaspert notes that Waverley
    \ is very similar to Walbaum, which together with the numbers, prompts me to think
    that it is fairly likely that Waverley is the font used in your book.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks guys (especially you donshottype)!\r\n\r\nVery useful indeed, and
    I agree that it must be Waverley. I'll see if I can get hold of a sample. This
    one looks promising: <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.co.uk/WAVERLEY-NEW-INTERTYPE-FACE-Corporation-n.d/12529533528/bd\">http://www.abebooks.co.uk/WAVERLEY-NEW-INTERTYPE-FACE-Corporation-n.d/12529533528/bd</a>\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas about the one used for the page with the table on it? Doesn't look like
    the same font to me. Perhaps it's a more ordinary one? Hmmm...\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks!\r\n\r\nJonas\r\n"

    the effort of digging though the huge files on the site to find a high quality
    resolution of the page you posted, I  found it in the jp2 package, converted it
    to a standard jpeg, and split it into strips that can be read relatively easily

    site claims that the pdf has very high resolution scans, but I don't feel like
    using 3 gig of bandwidth to download it.\r\nIf sombody is prepared to do this
    it would be most interesting to see the result.\r\nDon"
