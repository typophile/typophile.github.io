  <BR> <BR>Idea <BR>The idea is simple, sortof like a photo gallery, but without any
  photos whatsoever. With a canvass 170 pixels wide, and 410 pixels high, create a
  typographical representation of yourself. It can include as many details as you
  wish, for example, real name, nickname, website, email, height, weight, eye colour,
  age, date of birth, and so on. This will be ongoing, so there wont be any kind of
  deadline. <BR> <BR>Submissions <BR>It couldnt be easier, create your image, save
  it as a jpg, if in photoshop, save at 100% quality. Then email the jpg to [email]<a
  href="mailto:Type@lethaldosage.net">Type@lethaldosage.net</a>[/email]. Make sure
  you include in the email, your name, the email address you wish displayed, if any,
  and your website name, and URL. <BR> <BR><a href="http://lethaldosage.net/type"
  target="_blank">http://lethaldosage.net/type</a> <BR> <BR>If any of the mods feel
  this is spam, or in the wrong forum, feel free to move it, i couldnt work out where
  to put it.
