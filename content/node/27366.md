  I'm pretty sure it's from FontFont, but I better ask the experts... I already run
  it through Font Expert 3.0 with no luck!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nQuesito"

    by Christoph Noordzij, published at TEFF. That sample is from my Serif Guide,
    which is how I found it, using the roman 'b' and e' and then looking for a shape
    match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Yep. Nice work, Mike and The Serif ID Guide! The similarities with Proforma
    make sense as I believe Noordzij and van Blokland both studied under <a href="http://www.teff.nl/ontwerpers/ontwerpers.html">Gerrit
    Noordzij</a> at KABK.
