body: "Hi, i had this up here a few weeks ago and got pointed in the direction of
  \"forgotten futurist\" which is REALLY close but it's just not close enough unfortunately.
  I've messed with the possibilities in illustrator but it's just not right. It may
  have to do but if anyone can helps with the correct one that'd be fantastic. \r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nTobz"
