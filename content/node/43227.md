body: I'm building a unicase display font with only uppercase letters and I wanted
  to know what is the standard practice for key inputs? For example should I create
  it so that when you press SHIFT + A you get the cap A or set it so even if you just
  press "a" you get the cap "A"?

  body: If there is only one style of cap (no alternates) it's preferred that both
    the lowercase and uppercase slots are filled, even if the glyph is the same.

  body: Aawesome thanks. Here is another question. I'm using TypeTool, should I put
    the characters in both the lowercase and uppercase slots or is there a way to
    remap the lowercase keystroke to be identical to the uppercase?

  body: Nevermind with the second question. I figured out how to easily copy and paste
    the glyphs between slots. Thanks again.

  body: BTW, [[unicase]] usually refers to a typeface that has a single case but uses
    some upper- and some lowercase forms.

  body: Thanks for the correction. That's pretty confusing cause to me uni means one.
    Is there a name for a font that only contains one case?
