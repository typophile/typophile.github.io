body: On this site as its own main category, there should be a list of contests that
  go on each month.  Afew suggestions could be promoting a new font by making a poster
  for it, promotional pieces etc.  That is only one suggestion.  IT could be anything.  Just
  a contest that people who are appart of this forum can participate in if they are
  interested.  I know I want to make some promotional pieces and a decent logo for
  myself, that could be one of the contests that people can participate in if interested.  What
  does everyone think?

    though admittedly I would not have had much of a chance.

  body: 'Type contests suck. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not like you can just mail in the tear-sheet
    for an ad. You have to specially create a specimen. Pay for the print-out. Get
    it mounted. Pay for the courier. <BR> <BR>Contest-books are an even bigger rip-off:
    Free content for publishers! <BR> <BR>And then some bunch of celebs &#40;does
    not correlate with having a critical faculty&#41; gets to pick and choose. <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s spec work, frowned upon by the AIGA, GDC, etc. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
    waste your time and money on a crap-shoot -- invest in advertising and support
    the fifth estate!  <BR>'

  body: Yeah, most of them are crap. But if you find a free one that&#39;s prestigious,
    it&#39;s worth it. Like Morisawa. They even give cash prizes. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    dash</a> contest. :-P I know I was late and all, but they were really good links&#40;!&#41;
    And it was humanly impossible to post 100 quality links in 28 days. <BR> <BR>But
    I think I&#39;ll just buy the tee. Do you ship to Asia? Please do. <BR>
