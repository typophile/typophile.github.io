  Growers', of which I have a PDF scan, freely available from the <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.aus-vn4931952\">National
  Library of Australia</a>.  I'm including a raster sample below, which features a
  distinctive 'Q' and (I hope) a reasonable mix of uppers and lowers:</p>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/germ-growers-sample_4629.png]\r\n\r\n<p>The
  print quality or resolution was too poor to get a good result from WhatFontis.  Identifont
  suggested that it's \"Escrow\", and it's really close... but that didn't exist in
  1892.  Also, the eye of the 'b' and 'd' is a bit too full and round, and so generally
  with the miniscules... Escrow is just that much too wide to be a perfect match.
  \ A little digging revealed that Escrow referenced Monotype\u2019s 1908 Scotch No.
  36, but even that's too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book was printed by J. S. Virtue
  & Co. of London, in 1892, if that helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raph Levien suggested that
  it is similar to \"Round-face on long-primer body, Farmer Little & Co\", <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=18gDAAAAIAAJ&pg=P221&dq=plain+printing+types&hl=en&ei=S5uOTefnEcqz0QGfvLW4Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false\">p.221
  of De Vinne's Plain Printing Types</a>, but noted that my sample has longer descenders.
  \ He reflected that that might be, \"the biggest clue - most Scotch Roman and \"Modern\"
  fonts have fairly short descenders.\"  He referred me to this board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd
  really appreciate any help or suggestions.</p>\r\n"

  body: "The problem with the Identifont and Raph\u2019s suggestions (in addition
    to the dates) is that your font was almost undoubtedly cast and sold in Great
    Britain, not America. It will be foundry type, not Monotype.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll
    want to find specimens for British foundries of the late 1800s. Each probably
    offered a handful of Modern style fonts like this. Without a better sample, it
    may be difficult to pin down exactly which foundry this particular example was
    from.\r\n\r\nThis could also very well have come from one of the Scottish foundries
    in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly common style from that period. I have a 1923
    Stephenson Blake & Co. specimen and there are at least four Moderns for body text
    that get close. But by this time, SB had converted most of their fonts to alignment
    on the American Point Lining system. This alignment is what led to short descenders
    in many cases.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll want to find samples from before the adoption
    of that standard.\r\n"

    much about typefaces or their histories, or how to track such things down... is
    there any resource that points to which fonts were being used by which printers?
    \ I'm thinking it might be easier to identify the font if I knew what J. S. Virtue
    commonly used."
