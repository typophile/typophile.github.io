body: "hi i was wondering if anyone can give me some imput on some cool dingbat fonts.
  i am looking for some cool looking \"hearts\" \"smiley faces\" and \"peace sign.\"
  should not be OVERLY stylized.. something more modern looking... could also have
  a 70's vibe but totally not necessary.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance!"

  body: Fontalicious had some great dingbat sets. Very cool, if slightly juvenile,
    but many have the very '70s vibe you're looking for. And lo and behold! [[http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&category=1060&keywords=all|They're
    available again!]]
