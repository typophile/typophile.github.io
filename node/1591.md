body: In the course of some recent research I have come across some fonts, that seem
  to have the letters &#34;Cg&#34; before the actual font name, such as <BR> <BR>Cg
  Cloister [<a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?41G" target="_blank">http://www.identifont.com/show?41G</a>]
  <BR>Cg Garamond [<a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?3Z3" target="_blank">http://www.identifont.com/show?3Z3</a>]
  <BR> <BR>or indeed any of the following array of fonts found at <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Cg&amp;q=Find"
  target="_blank">http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Cg&amp;q=Find</a> <BR> <BR>What
  does the Cg stand for? It doesn&#39;t appear to relate to a particular foundry or
  style. <BR> <BR>Anyone? <BR> <BR>

  body: I believe that the CG stands for Compugraphic, which was a phototypesetting
    system/company. Many classics were &#34;adapted&#34; for setting on the Compugraphic
    system. The company was eventually acquired by AgfaMonotype. I think that you&#39;ll
    find that all of the fonts with the &#34;Cg&#34; prefix are published by AgfaMonotype
    and are probably designs that were inherited from Compugraphic.

  body: Yes, I think you are absolutely right. <BR> <BR>I have since come across similar
    historical info on this page [<a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/ext20.html"
    target="_blank">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/ext20.html</a> &#40;under Compugraphic&#41;]
    as well as a list of Compugraphic fonts all with the Cg prefix on another page
    [<a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/compugraphic.txt" target="_blank">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/compugraphic.txt</a>].
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help, Kent, consider my question answered.
