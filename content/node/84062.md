  body: "Don't think it's the same typeface you've pointed out Stephen but could be
    by Alex Wierderin too. The publication is Contributor Magazine. This typeface
    appears to be used all over issue #3. More samples [[http://www.contributormagazine.com/810.php|here]].
    /P's \"Falling\" counter looks very distinctive...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/albert_01_5575.jpg]"

  body: "Contributor magazine. \r\nIm a noob but I dont think it's Alex's for Another
    Mag?\r\nI like the roundness of the C, the Didot thin/thick contras & how the
    bridge in M & N connected at the top(how u guys call this?)\r\n\r\nBtw, pls also
    check this one out for me, since to me this could be its complimentary scripty
    lower case combo:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/84020\r\nThanks."
