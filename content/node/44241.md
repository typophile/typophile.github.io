  to which i will be adding text reading \"city express\".\r\n\r\nthe bike's so girly
  i think i need a script font (catholic schoolgirl comes to mind) whose lines blend
  well with the design. at the same time, \"city express\" should reflect the idea
  of fast movement, like a courier service would want to convey. to express this angle
  of the idea, i'm tempted to use a font that can be italicized/slanted (to convey
  movement), but script fonts aren't well suited to italics, as far as i know.\r\n\r\nany
  suggestions? a script that works to convey movement, or a girlier font that can
  be italicized.\r\n\r\nthank you in advance. i don't come to this board often but
  i'm always impressed by the level of discussion here."
