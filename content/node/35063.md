  exact match. I'm trying to find the typeface the Aesthetic Apparatus uses on a lot
  of their gigposters. Here are few examples. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.gigposters.com/poster/77373_Deaths.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gigposters.com/poster/46913_Raveonettes.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gigposters.com/poster/45714_Interpol.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gigposters.com/poster/64088_Secret_Machines.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI

    Gothic</a> which is only slightly more square.
