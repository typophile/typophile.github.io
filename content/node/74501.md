  ones I'm familiar with are:\r\n\r\nExcelsior\r\nIonic\r\nMercury \r\nEudald news
  http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/eudald-news\r\n\r\nare their any other
  great ones that I should check out before I make my decision? serif or sans serif.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nI also would like to know what peoples opinions are about Flama, is
  it a good choice for display type for a newspaper?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/flama]]\r\n\r\nThank

  body: I think the two foundries that have done the most newspaper fonts recently
    are Font Bureau and Hoefler & Frere Jones. I would definitely look at their fonts
    and if anything looks interesting talk to them (via skype?) about your needs,
    as well as to Nick Shinn and Mario Feliciano. I am also very impressed with Peter
    Bilak's Greta Text. Adobe's Utopia is another one widely used for newspapers,
    I believe, and Jean Francois Porchez has done a number of fine newspaper fonts
    also. Personally, I like Rocky a lot as a headline font. (Le Monde is using it
    now, I think.)

  body: I agree that it does have a strong personality, but I think the regular weights
    set in small sizes have a surprisingly even and neutral appearance suited to the
    requirements of a newspaper typeface. That said, it does of course depend on the
    newspaper.

  body: "Lot's of newspapers have at some time used Times New Roman for running text.
    None of them was printed sheet-fed as The Times was in 1932, so their results
    were often subpar. Times New Roman is a delicate design you see.\r\n\r\nThese
    days newsprint is much better, CTP and all. Starling doesn't offer grades I far
    as I can see so colour will be a problem."

  body: And Jad, I've used Flama for a newspaper design in progress, and it's worked
    out nicely so far. Compared to some of the other straight-sided sans's, it has
    a characteristic warmth. If you need that hard-edged, almost techy feel, it might
    not be ideal. But more often than not some friendliness is a good thing in a newspaper
    setting.

    post, was named after H.L. Mencken. Here's what it says on the site:\r\n\r\n\"The
    family\u2019s name Mencken is a tribute to H.L. Mencken\u2019s journalistic contributions
    to The Sun. According to the London Daily Mail, Mencken ventured beyond the typewriter
    into the world of typography. Because he felt Americans did not recognize irony
    when they read it, he proposed the creation of a special typeface to be called
    ironics, with the text slanting in the opposite direction from italic types, to
    indicate the author\u2019s humour.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a half-century before the
    proposed sarc mark!"
