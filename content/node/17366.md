    you also post your own stuff."

    without destroying the general slab-serif effect (better for immersive reading
    :-P). I can't imagine setting text with such a font, but it would be okay for
    a logo or title or something.

    it's odd that blackletter lends itself so well to such a system, even though it's
    so calligraphic. Does it simply arise from nib pen writing technique, or was there
    a philosophy promoting a 45\xB0 stroke angle as ideal?"

    With the second try, I started with pencil and paper, the same as I would with
    a real lettering project or a font. I knew it would be more work, but I think
    it made a big difference. Whether it becomes an actual font, who knows. I don't
