    be challenged and make the small effort to defend your decisions. This is not

  body: "Well,I think \"neutral\" is because of cultural history here in the US. I
    wonder if it will look neutral to European eyes. \r\n\r\nThis looks to me like
    its ancestry is the Century family, which recently has also had other grandchildren,
    or great grandchildren: Benton Modern, from Font Bureau, Chronicle, from Hoefler
    & Frere Jones, and Worldwide by Nick Shinn. \r\n\r\nI guess if I were thinking
    of using this genre, I'd want to compare these and others. James's fine craftsmanship
    always makes his entries contenders. "

    I inherited from my father.  The forms are elegant, but the main thing about them
    is, somebody really skillful made them to be used.

  body: "Fortunately it is inadmissible (in the majority of cases) to conclude from
    a character trait in togetherness to the quality of the creative work of a person.
    Unfortunately most people don\u2019t know that. Fortunately most people here seem
    to know that. Unfortunately potential customers don\u2019t necessarily know that.\r\n\r\nThe
    friendliness of a typeface <em>for body copy</em> is in its readability. And a
    certain neutrality is one of the requirements for the readability. A typeface
    for body copy tendentially is friendly, if it <em>is</em> neutral, but not cold.
    But if it <em>looks</em> neutral or friendly or whatever, it already may drag
    attention to itself. So a typeface is a counterpart (face). It is neutral, if
    the reader is able to receive the content of the text. If you compare a typeface
    with the face of a beautiful woman and if faces primary had the function, just
    to communicate thoughts, than the face of the woman can be dysfunctional. But
    letters are not extensively in contradiction to the faces of living beings. The
    human skin is not white space. So the spaces in and between letters ease the look
    through them into the content that the text transports with the help of the letters."

  body: "> The friendliness of a typeface <em>for body copy</em> is in its readability.\r\n\r\n1)
    I wouldn't call that \"friendliness\".\r\n2) We're never 100% immersed in reading,
    certainly not for the duration of a given reading task. For the portion of attention
    that we're not immersed, aesthetics -which appeals to the consciousness- does
    kick in. This is why there can never be a \"perfect\" typeface for reading.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Since I call all typefaces, that are highly readable, friendly, the term
    <em>friendly</em> is inept for the description of the specific properties of a
    typeface. They are friendly, because they serve. If I would feel unfriendliness,
    when I come to consciousness during the reading process, I would be more irritated
    and would less easier find back. I doubt, that a typeface for body copy, which
    is unfriendly, would be often used for body copy.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think, that
    your second remark is a contradiction to my comment. I agree in it."

    you wanted to say, that the reader only enjoys the content of the text, while
    he is reading. During the reading process the friendliness of the typeface can
    be subconsciously perceived like the presence of a loyal servant."
