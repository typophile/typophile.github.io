body: Anyone know anything about the lettering saying &#34;le mot&#34; in <a href="http://projekti.svarog.org/prva_svetovna_vojna/zivljenje_med_vojno/slika_dante.jpg">this
  masthead</a>? I imagine it&#39;s not really type.  <BR> <BR>It looks ca. WW2 to
  me &#40;or Bauhaus at the earliest&#41;, but it&#39;s really from WW1!

  body: I&#39;ve seen it before, but I can&#39;t remember where. I checked a couple
    of books I have about French art deco, but no luck.

  body: Mark, you might have seen it in the book ABZ, More Alphabets <BR>and Other
    Signs. A different Le Mot cover is featured on <BR>page 24. &#40;The cover design
    is attributed to Paul Iribe, Paris, 1914.&#41; <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Yes, that&#39;s probably it. I have that book. I agree it doesn&#39;t look
    like type. It does look like they were trying to be provocative and avant garde.
    I imagine that a design like that would have raised a few eyebrows in 1914. Other
    than that, I don&#39;t know what to say about it except that I like it.
