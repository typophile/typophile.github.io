    of simulated &#34;tension&#34; to the corners - anywhere where two pieces fit
    together &#40;please excuse my lack of vocabulary&#41; - there&#39;s slightly
    more white space - did you make an outline version w/o rounded corners? it would
    be interesting to see, just to see if it has the same sort of tense, jittery quality
    to it <BR> <BR>the 3d treatment used at the bottom left works beautifully. '

    If I can ever find enough free time I might give a square version a go... <BR>
    <BR>btw I really enjoy your work. '

    really have to be 0&#39;s and not dots. '
