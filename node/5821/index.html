		<div class="commentbody">&#34;Keyholes don&#39;t look like that anymore.&#34; <BR> <BR>True, but we all know that is a keyhole. And plenty of great older homes still have that trademark keyhole. <BR> <BR>#1 is too literal. <BR> <BR>#2 has potential. I agree with Soren. If not remove the bottom stroke, perhaps just shorten it to give it the &#39;hint&#39; of a bottom strok. <BR> <BR>#3 I like for some reason. The keyhole is obviously horizontal, which doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, but I do like the form. <BR> <BR>But perhaps the concept of an actual &#39;key&#39; is maybe just too literal. To be fair, &#39;TurnKey&#39; is a pretty generic name to begin with, so you don&#39;t have a lot to work with.</div>

It feels like you are forcing an insignifigant relationship between the R and a keyhole. I am not getting a reward out of this logo &#34;yet&#34;.  I was under the assumtion that the website was rewarding it&#39;s users if they were to &#34;Turn the Key&#34;, turning the key I assume is a metaphor for the unlimited access to the real estate market the website provides.

		<div class="commentbody">David, I like very much that way of thinking - making the viewer actually perform the name - and if this works, you&#39;ve got a very memorable logo. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, I see some drawbacks <BR>- vertical type is low legibility <BR>- vertical type is unpleasant to look at &#40;to me at least ... I always think of somebody jumping from a high building, when I see vertical type on street signs&#41; <BR>- real estate agents need a more flexible, less space-consuming system for their ads, right? <BR>- you have made the type perform a 90 degree rotation ... in fact it should be at least 360 degree &#40;what I mean: the pun is too subtle&#41; <BR> <BR>I hate to sound negative ... because, again, it&#39;s the right way of thinking. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The R is still not resolved <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0>  <BR>The Typeface in # 3 works the best. <BR>Although I feel overall the type should be alot bolder. In this case the type should represent the resiliancy of a door or a vault. Right know using these typefaces makes me feel like I don&#39;t even need a key at all. There is not much contrast going on..........I wish I could write in words what runs through my head. Anyway, that key hole seems really weak and flimsy. Locks and Keys are strong and powerful things. You want a viewer to feel like they have gained something when they sign up for this site.  <BR> <BR>The metaphor is this: <BR> <BR>Turning a key is like opening a door, which is like gaining access to something inaccessible, which is like heaven and discoving something new. It&#39;s like opening a real estate treasure chest. It&#39;s like loosing your virginity, it&#39;s like being bar-mitzvahed, it&#39;s like having your first beer. It&#39;s like cracking the code. Anyway, you get the point. <BR> <BR>Good luck. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like them Sally, I agree simple is better. I bet that most of the people who come to the site wouldn&#39;t even remember what the logo looked like. They want access to information quickly and simply. What happens here is we think visually but not about the end user. I tend to like version 1 and the typeface doesn&#39;t bother me. Remember, Helvetica has become very popular again. Like fashion, typefaces come into vogue. Maybe you are a trend setter  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">If there was no intimidation this company would not exist. I feel that the logos express the idea of a &#34;Key&#34; by having a key hole Yet they do not express the idea of &#34;turn&#34;. I guess my biggest problem with this logo is that the keyhole is still in the locked position when the name says &#34;unlock&#34;. The name isn&#39;t &#34;Key&#34; it&#39;s &#34;TurnKey&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#34;the logo needs to communicate that with TurnKey, creating a website is easy and simple&#34; <BR> <BR>Sally, I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve achieved the goal you set for yourself. The logos you&#39;ve created thus far say &#39;real estate&#39; but more in the sense of a real estate agency, not a service for realitors. Is Turnkey a software program? A template to download? How will the logo be used? on packaging? on-line? The fonts you&#39;ve been using give the design a delicate look. Appropriate for an agency that specializes in million &#43; estates, but is it appropriate for this client and their product? If simple is the main concept you wish to communicate I think the logo is still too complex. The two-tone key hole is distracting and personally I don&#39;t think the shadow 3-d effect adds anything to your icon, and I do like the key hole. I know you are planning on wrapping this up soon. I&#39;m sorry if this sounds negative - it&#39;s not meant to be. Your designs look nice, and are leaning towards quite elegant. It&#39;s just that from your own description it seems like they aren&#39;t hitting the mark yet.</div>
