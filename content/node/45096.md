  me this looks like the one designed for the telephone book (don't know why someone
  would blow it up and put it on a poster...)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Silo1_6094.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  one's from a club flyer.\r\n\r\nThanks for any hints.\r\n\r\nClinton"

  body: I think Bell Centennial is gorgeous when blown up (I am well aware that that
    is not its intended purpose).

  body: I agree with Achilles about Bell Centennial's beauty in big sizes. It is absolutely
    the quirkyness of the ink traps that attract me. It is what gives it just enough
    character to be interesting even in a corporate use.
