body: I am working on designing a logo for a new youth hockey league. I&#39;ve &#34;test-driven&#34;
  about 2500 fonts today and none of them feel quite right. The request is to make
  it feel very contemporary or very classic. Here a couple of logos that they gave
  me to review <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/24110.jpg"

  alt="capitals">  <BR> <BR>&#40;one of the fonts I&#39;m considering&#41;. My brain
  is getting fried. Does anyone have any fonts they would like to offer up as possible
  ideas? Any input would be greatly appreciated!

  body: What city is the Capitals from? As for the samples the bottom two look like
    baseball logos. The Chicago Blues logo uses a good regional device a note symbol.
    If you are lucky maybe you have something as distictive like a Capital Dome.

  body: Thanks for your input. The Capitals are from Indianapolis &#40;it used to
    be a professional league here in the 40s&#41;. I know the logos look like baseball,
    but they are youth hockey logos and are modern versions of old hockey logos. I
    have plenty of great artwork, I just can&#39;t find the fonts that really fit
    with the &#34;look&#34; they&#39;re trying to achieve. The Capitals had 2 logos
    &#40;one is shown below-they didn&#39;t put the name of the team on their jersey
    just the picture&#41; and the other one was just a big C with the player&#39;s
    number in it. All the current youth travel league teams are named after former
    professional Indianapolis hockey teams. They thought about just using the Washington
    Capitals logo, but decided they wanted something unique. I am also trying to incorporate
    the an updated version &#40;just bits and pieces of it&#41; of our states flag&#39;s
    torch &#40;which I will also show below&#41;. The look they want is modern with
    a possible nostalgic feel, cool but classic. They want to project an image that
    they represent up-to-date hockey teaching backed by the history of Indianapolis
    hockey. I do appreciate all input. Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/24160.jpg"
