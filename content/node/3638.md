body: Have seen a couple of sans with contrast on all characters, except  on v, y,
  A and the likes, which is almost symmetrical.  <BR>Is this legal? Is this another
  &#34;school&#34; or what? <BR>What I mean is, is there any theory behind it?

  body: I can give Scala sans and Interstate as examples... <BR>I think they theoreticly
    should have more contrast on these characters...

    recently, my Mana-16&#42; has stroke contrast, but in those letters the thinning
    happens at the joins. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/000121.php"

    contrast can be a good thing &#40;especially for readability&#41;, irrespective
    of where it comes from. As a result, there&#39;s really nothing Wrong about doing
    that, except upsetting some type designers. <BR> <BR>The &#34;theory&#34; might
    be that it makes structural sense, that it has a harmony missing -or at least
    different- from the doddering ductus school. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: One argument against this is that all other characters contrast are based
    on calligraphy, and this makes the font uneven. But then again, who cares as long
    as it looks good...
