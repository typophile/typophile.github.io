<div class=commentbody>Come on guys...
Seriously, I believe that designers, and AD REPS damn them! need to be more congizant of their actions. It comes as a part of being a human being. It takes half a second to spec more environmentally friendly papers, inks, etc.
The main drawback is quality and cost. But if you can beat it into the Money's head that saying "environmentally friendly" on the packaging helps improve their product's image, you might just get your point across.
As to the war aspect, consider this: The US government washes their tanks with GASOLINE. 'Nuff said.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Designers <em>can</em> play a huge role in society; most don't. Those designing for products that have a massive impact on the lives of people around the world, or those who get into the world of politics—which they often don't now, as the 24-hour news cycle has wiped out the time needed to work good design into politics—have to be careful about the ethical lines they might be crossing; I believe that most designers are doing quite well when it comes to ethical decision making. I think that this is in large part due to the glaring examples of what happens when designers go bad that we have left over from the twentieth century: all the great designers who worked tirelessly designing propaganda for the Nazi and Communist parties which then committed unconscionable acts against humanity that overshadow all other great evils of history.
So as designers have to be vigilant, and be sure that none of us is designing the next <em>Mein Kampf</em> or <em>Little Red Book</em>. Designers need to be well aware of the world around them; the last thing western civilization needs is a new crop of great propagandists working for groups like ANSWER/The World Workers Party, Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, etc. We must also learn from the mistakes of the past, from artists like Paul Renner and El Lizzitsky whose work on behalf of communism helped condemn hundreds of millions of people to tyranny and suffering, or worst of all, Leni Reifenstahl, whose Nazi propaganda work made her the the most influential filmmaker in history, in respect both to cinematic techniques and the millions her work condemned to gas chambers. By studying the ideologies of tyranny—fascism, communism, socialism, jihad, etc.—we can learn to recognize them and their methods, and ensure that we do not lend our efforts to their causes. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Last week there was an interesting forum about this topic in London:
eye magazine organised a panel discussion called ‘Burning Issues’.
http://eyeburningissues1.typepad.com/forum/
One of the four participants in this panel, the designer Lucienne Roberts, said that of course she is thinking very carefully for which clients she is working for (and for which ones she certainly doesn’t), but she didn’t forget to add that she was in the fortunate position to choose.
I think, this is a very important point she made – a lot of designers, especially if they are just out of college simply do not have the choice. They are lucky if they can get any work at all. But that doesn’t mean that it has to stay like this throughout one’s carrier. The more experience we gain, the more this enables us to make choices – some people choose to go with the stream, some don’t. It is a certain luxury to be able to make choices, and this doesn’t develop by chance – it is the result of a deliberate effort. Responsibility grows with the freedom of choice.
Design is taking place not in a vacuum or in an ivory tower, but in a certain social and economic environment, largely determined by politics.
Whereas it would be very naïve to think that design can ‘change things’ and it is quite safe to say that the notion of the designer as some sort of self-declared saviour is undoubtedly the result of delusion nourished by vanity, it is also quite irresponsible if we designers prefer to think not about what the effects of our daily work are.
The designer has a responsibility – a professional one to one’s client (to deliver excellent, good or at least decent work in time and on the previously agreed terms) as well as an ethical one (do we think that the result of what we are doing is helping to promote ideas that we think are worth to be promoted or at least do not cause harm?) – in the same way as any other profession has. It is up to anyone of us to make decisions how we want to deal with this responsibility and how far we want to take this responsibility serious or not.
The best way to increase the effect of what we are doing is to work on our qualification, the best way to increase our judgement on ethical questions is trying to be informed about the political and economic framework in which we are working (which is easier said than done, especially if we live in states that are quite actively engaged in conflicts).
BTW:
Paul Renner was never a communist, he never promoted revolutionary ideals (and therefore was harshly denounced by Tschichold – behind his back, which was probably not very fair by Tschichold, since it was Renner who invited Tschichold to teach at the Meisterschule in Munich). In fact, he was a conservative liberal who just cared about social issues.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>but hey wait guys, what about NIKE? they use slave labour in 3rd world countries and what about that?</cite>
That's essentially the point of many previous posts: if a designer feels that a potential client's behavior is unethical, he or she should not take on the job. And when it comes to companies like Nike there are a lot of designers out there who don't take the work. There are design firms out there that do nothing but non-profit work for this reason.
<cite>I think, this is a very important point she made – a lot of designers, especially if they are just out of college simply do not have the choice.</cite>
That sounds more like an excuse than a well-reasoned maxim. In free nations, if a designer runs into ethical complications, he has the option to just not do the work. That might mean not working in a great design job, or even not getting paid to work in design, but a designer still has the option of not doing work he finds reprehensible.
<cite>Paul Renner was never a communist...</cite>
In retrospect I should never have mentioned Renner. What I know of him is what's popped up in passing in survey texts, in which I have seen him painted as a socialist, communist, and other things.
<cite>I believe there’s a position open at the CIA for a graphic designer...</cite>
I've talked to people who had those jobs. The work is mostly internal document layout, although if you're really lucky, you get a job “designing” fake IDs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Renner was an interesting figure. One generation older than the modernists, he started as a traditionalist, but later he incorporated some of the views of the modernists into his work without sharing their political ideas. Nevertheless, the fact that he defended the ideas of the modernists against attacks from the Nazis made him loose his job as head of the Meisterschule in Munich.

But as to promoting hatred of any form, reasonable people aren't going to promote Nazism. People whose sense of reason is based on the almighty dollar might.
So the arguement boils down to "what can we do individually, ethically and conscienciously?"</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you Wolfgang Homola, I enjoyed your writing.
Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children tend to misunderstand wealth. They confuse it with money. They think that there is a fixed amount of it. And they think of it as something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created (and might be created unequally).
The difference between design and research seems to be a question of new versus good. Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. I think these two paths converge at the top : the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving. So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions.
Design begins by asking, who is this for and what do they need from it ?
A good architect, for example, does not begin by creating a design that he then imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring out what they need, not "what they want." This may vary from field to field in the arts, but I don't think there is any field in which the best work is done by the people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.
It's hard to design something for an unsophisticated user. It's hard to stay interested in something you don't like yourself. To make something good, you have to be thinking, "wow, this is really great," not "what a piece of sh** ; those fools will love it."
Design means making things for humans. But it's not just the user who's human. The designer is human too.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>But as to promoting hatred of any form, reasonable people aren’t going to promote Nazism.</em>
Maybe not now, but in the 1920s and 1930s a lot of reasonable people jumped on to the Nazi bandwagon. That's why designers must be aware of happenings past and present at local, national, and international levels. We must be able to spot the evil in the world, and at a minimum, not become a part of it.
Personally I think that all accredited design education entities should be required to include instruction in ethical philosophy to ensure that students develop the mental faculties required make solid ethical decisions. Many business degrees now do so, and I feel that it's just as important for design professionals to understand ethics as it is for middle management to.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hats off to Wolfgang and Alessandro for raising the level of this post! Thankyou gentlemen.
As for MissG's original question – "what else should a designer keep in mind...", I'd say that the chief requirement is to keep that mind <em>open</em>.
I worked for a couple of non-profits when I was a student; in hindsight it was an absolute luxury, and one that I could afford at the time. Lots of people simply don't have the choice. These days I occasionally use Papanek's blistering condemnation of the design and advertising industries (Design for The Real World, Paladin, 1972) as the raw text for typesetting exercises.
Some long-held convictions of mine about design and ethical conduct got recently overturned by reading both the article and ensuing comments on Michael Bierut's designobserver blog about how five American 'star' designers boycotted a national design awards function at the White House in July of this year. It's at
http://www.designobserver.com/archives/015742.html
and perhaps more importantly, James Victore's panelled discussion between Crye Associates and The 62, published by the AIGA, entitled <a h/ref="http://www.amazon.com/Fresh-Dialogue-Friendly-Voices-Graphic/dp/1568985827/sr=1-1/qid=1164600615/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-0486363-1791103?ie=UTF8&s=books">Fresh Dialogue 6: Friendly Fire</a> was a bold move to highlight some of these issues. It gave me the chance to reconsider what professionalism might really constitute in this context.
If this kind of stuff genuinely interests you, MissG, keep reading and keep questioning (yourself as much as anyone else).
James Puckett, you know I've told you before – on other threads here at typophile – to read the literature on Paul Renner before you go blackballing him as either a Nazi or a Communist. He wasn't either of those things. That other people on this thread are <em>still</em> telling you to read Christopher Burke's book shouldn't suprise me, but it does disapoint me. Likewise to shrug off your bias as originating in uncited texts that 'popped up in passing' does you no favours either. Doubtless you think you're 'reasonable people' too; after all you're on talking terms with CIA employees.</div>

Honestly, I believed Paul Renner was a communist (specifically a Bolshevist) because I actually spent some time reading about him last year after I had earlier read some poorly translated texts that tied the design of Futura to the Nazis. I'm not attempting to shrug off my mistake, it's just that I've read so many design texts that mention Renner that I can't keep track of them; his name pops up more often than Tschischold's in design books, and at this point I realize I'm quite confused about the man. Regardless, I'm happy to be proven wrong, so I've ordered the book and when it arrives I'll read it and get back to you.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for sharing that info about the National Design Awards. I couldn't have attended an awards ceremony at the White House either (not that I was invited lol) and that makes me respect those designers and their ethics.
Part of Buddhism's eight-fold path is "right livelihood". I could beat myself up for not being a doctor or teaching inner city youth or volunteering to rebuild villages destroyed in awar. We can't fool ourselves that design makes that kind of difference in the world. One reason I've chosen to work in book publishing rather than, say, advertising or branding is that I find it easier to live with myself - I think the world needs more books.
To quote Jimmy Ernst:
Artists and poets are the raw nerve ends of humanity.
By themselves they can do little to save humanity.
Without them there would be little worth saving.</div>

I think that the world has too many books. At least, too many worthless piles of trash that pass themselves off as books. It's a shame that so many people can't tell the difference between something worthwile to read and something that atrophies their minds.
Our real ethical challenge as Designers for Humanity™ is that there is so much STUFF bombarding people's eyes that it is hard to tell what is truly beautiful anymore. People hardly have any frames of reference to make sound judgements. Things are so muddy that there isn't a Yin or a Yang. There is only Gray chaos with a few bright spots here and there.
The least we can do is try to be those bright spots by being dedicated to the traditions of our craft and continuously trying to make it even more useful and beautiful.</div>

Hey, some of us need a rest from the serious stuff now and then, and even pulp is better for the mind than most television! I had to read a pile of crap from BL publishing to recover after I finished <em>House of Leaves.</em>
<cite>there is so much STUFF bombarding people’s eyes that it is hard to tell what is truly beautiful anymore. People hardly have any frames of reference to make sound judgements.</cite>
I don't think so. I just spent a few days playing with my toddler niece and driving around in the desert, which is always a reminder that if smiling kids and rugged landscapes aren't great frames of reference, nothing is. When art or design contains barely a tiny shade of the beauty we can find in the undesigned world, the ugliness stands out just as much as it ever has, and we eventually learn to see through it all and appreciate the good stuff even more.</div>

Starting from your post and ignoring all the rest (though I like Paul Cutler's remarks), graphic designers do whatever they are paid to do. There is no ethics involved in this. If there were, some of them might starve. Never heard of that happening. Mainly, some of them just quit. Those are the good folk. But nobody knows who they were.

Here Here! I certainly agree. It's just so easy to get angry at the ignorant/lazy design flooding the senses perpetually.
<cite>There is no ethics involved in this</cite>
What kind of a thing is that to say? There is ethics in every single action we make. Yes, we are paid as visual communicators, and yes, we mostly turn a blind eye on the banal. But when it comes to being socially and humanely responsible <cite>as it purtains to our limited scope of design</cite>, then we must do whatever is ethically correct, regardless of the compensation.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ben Archer, thank you.
Aziz, what ?
… this vision is also described by Dante in the <em>Divina Commedia</em>. Resonantor sympathetic nets formed interconnections through the whole system so that no event occurred alone. In this cosmos significant coincidences were naturals.
Just pay attention, the intellect has little to do with the road to discovery, so innovation does not require starting from scratch. This is good, because you can’t start from scratch : the universe has been here for a while.
In fact, successful innovation often happens simply because a curious person paid careful attention to how something in the world works. And once they really understood how people use that thing, they could see what was both good and bad about its value to those people. With that understanding, a creator can apply their imagination towards new ideas that eliminate the bad and expand on, or leap-frog, the good. Technical brilliance may be the only way to realize that imagination, but it’s the ability to generate or recognize those meaningful ideas that drives the best kinds of innovation.
Gerald Lange, it’s a pity you ignored the rest of the posts here, since you might have some good hints related to the hands-on nature of the creative typographic job for the book arts, I prefer to think you didn’t have got the time.
Indeed time is fleeting, for the ambiguous, time is ambiguous ; for the hero the time is heroic ; for the whore, the time is just another game. If you are gentle, your time is gentle ; if you are in a hurry, time blows away ; time is a servant if you are his chief ; time is your god, if you are his dog. We are the creators of the time, the dupes of the time and the murderers of the time. Time is without time.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Okay, okay... While topics like this bring up very good points, they can also border on being a bit too self-important.
Do designers play a huge role in society? Sure. Let's back up a minute, because, so do custodial workers. Take a stroll through the streets of New York City on any given trash collection day to see just how big the role of custodial workers are on society as a whole.
<em>That might mean not working in a great design job, or even not getting paid to work in design, but a designer still has the option of not doing work he finds reprehensible.</em>
This comment can be made ONLY by a person who is not living in poverty. Too many people often forget that living in the United States, or even being a student affords you luxuries that other people around the world don't have the luxury of. Like eating daily for example.
As a side note, on the Nike issue. Let me paint for you two pictures that I think are very similar, though they don't appear to be on the outside. Taking on Nike as a client is a lifestyle choice. Much like people in ghettos who choose to sell drugs. While one obviously appears to be more reprehensible on the surface, everyone has their own state of normal. Both households have mouths to feed. Both have a desire to attain material possessions.
Different people from different financial brackets are presented with different options in life. So, before we all start pointing fingers about what is right and wrong— realize that many of us have a CHOICE in sitting down to eat our vegan meals. Most of us in this thread don't have to sell illegal drugs to feed our families. I challenge anyone here to spend two weeks in Afghanistan without a dollar in your pocket. Let's see what you do then.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Miss Giggles, No. As <em>human beings</em> we have a huge role to play in society. As designers, very few of us will possess an immense enough cultural impact to affect the world as designer. The beautiful advertising for the most vile corporations and causes shows that there is no shortage of capable designers willing to do dirty work.
Some people are more bothered by working for and promoting Nikesque businesses than others are. Those of us most bothered will always try to find a way out. Unfortunately, its simply not easy. Even those who hold the most liberal beliefs in America are usually walking hypocritical nexuses, as they benefit from what they claim to despise, even indirectly. Want to free Tibet? Boycott China; good luck. Want organic foods? How do you think it arrived fresh at the Wal-mart that is bankrupting your home town?
I am looking for the right charity to donate a portion of !Exclamachine sales to. To me, this is essential to the process of moving from just free toys to trying to make income from it. Interestingly, every person I've mentioned this to thinks it is a bad idea. I can't imagine it any other way. This is part of getting to be my own boss, no? It wont make a huge difference in big picture, but it will do something, I hope.
These sort of struggles have nothing to do with being a designer, but with being alive.

On the contrary, I know exactly how privileged Americans are. And I appreciate that I'm lucky enough to be among the tiny minority of people who live in free nations and have the option of living by principles should we choose to do so. That's why I consider ethical behavior to be of great importance to those of us who have the option.

<div class=commentbody>The freedom need only be enough that you don't know what to do with it, It is not about illusion, but that nobody wants absolute freedom for everyone, no matter who they quote, or what they claim.
The extremely unethical behavior I imagine you are referring to is likely that typical of any empowered group. Or, in my suspicions, any potentially empowered group. People corrupt, power illuminates.

<div class=commentbody>People are peons, and the ones who don't know that are the most dangerous. It's not that some groups are Good and some are Evil, it's that some are more aware and others are more deluded. When somebody is sitting at the epicenter of world misery and thinks he's actually doing the world a favor, then that's a problem.

<div class=commentbody>><em>Whereas it would be very naïve to think that design can ‘change things’ and it is quite safe to say that the notion of the designer as some sort of self-declared saviour is undoubtedly the result of delusion nourished by vanity, it is also quite irresponsible if we designers prefer to think not about what the effects of our daily work are.</em><
With all due respect, you couldn't be more wrong if you tried.
Missgiggles, when you use the word - designer - does that include the architect?

Comments like the above just add to the amount of web page we have to scroll through - pushing the thread onto more than one page - without making (imho) any substantive contribution to the dialogue. Yes, flowers, we get it already.
I should add - if I sound grumpy it's in part because this site has been so buggy lately.</div>

I think it stems from the fact that most designers think that they should be important because their stuff can be seen everywhere. But deep down they know that they aren't really important at all, because it's xyz corp that is talking, not them.
If you want to say something profound, don't be a door to door salesman, be a preacher, teacher or philosopher. But you'll have to find your own audience, not the one that xyz corp buys for you.</div>

Granted teachers can play important roles in peoples lives but they also aren't free - most of them work for the state for instance.
It reminds me of when John Cage called Karlheinz Stockhausen a puppet of the state for taking West German money to finance his compositions…

"I think it stems from the fact that most designers think that they should be important because their stuff can be seen everywhere. But deep down they know that they aren’t really important at all, because it’s xyz corp that is talking, not them."
Personally, I now tend to call myself a 'graphic designer who has come to the conclusion that graphic design isn't as important as we graphic designers like to think it is'. Alas, I can't figure out how to fit that on my business card. ;o)
"what else should a designer keep in mind in regards to helping the world and society in ethical, political, economical forms?"
The same things anyone else in any other profession should be keeping in mind.</div>

Basically, all of them :)
Everybody wants to feel important. The truth is that we don't know our impact much beyond our family and work colleagues, with whom we have daily interaction.
In the 19th century the idea that grew up that artists were somehow the avant garde of social change, and that socially conscious art could change the world.
This idea is mainly laugable. And yet... I forget who it was, but someone who was a very intelligent observer, and there at the time, who said that it was the Beatles who really finished off the Soviet Communism. And this wasn't the 'power to the people, right on' rubbish that John later wrote, but the joy and happiness that radiated from their music. It was obvious that you could be really happy in London of the 60's. (I was there, and I was happy :) And there wasn't a lot of joy in the Soviet Union of the 60's evidently.
The basic thing is that if we live according to high ideals and ethical conduct we radiate good influence. How far it goes is not in our hands. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Judging reality via celebrities generally backfires. Rich rock stars tend to be happy pretty much anywhere with people who adulate rich rock stars. And watching US television/movies misleads billions worldwide daily.
But I certainly agree that behavior is contagious, and living well is inspirational.

<div class=commentbody>The only time I heard of them was in an Apple iPod commercial. Twenty years ago, I was in my 40s with young children and didn't pay attention to the pop music scene--I still don't. I listen to old 50s-60s R&B and opera, not much else.

I still don't get the Bono thing though? What is a Bono in this context?

<div class=commentbody>I started an environmental marketing agency in 1988. That was the year the Mississippi dried up, the Brundlandt Report coined the term "sustainable development", and the planet was Man of the Year on Time's cover.
It lasted a couple of years, but it didn't really fit into marketing culture, and I came to the conclusion that you can't position marketing services on anything but the traditional premises of speed, price, and quality -- quality being understood as "creativity" in this context.
Our philosophy was hard-core, which created two main difficulties, Firstly, we tried to get clients to take out smaller ads, print fewer, smaller brochures, still hoping to make them as effective of course. But advertisers balked. Especially the large corporations who buy lots of space at a good rate, and run big ads with lots of white space, which suits their status.
More problematic was the role of creativity itself, relating to the "stretched benefit". To be truly responsible, advertising has to offer an environmental audit of the product/service, but that results in straight talk about tangible product qualities, like B2B industrial advertising. Boring, eh?! That's not the way retail and consumer advertising works, where the norm is to attach some benefit to the product that has no connection (like a celebrity testimonial), or to stretch the benefit, eg use this and get sexy -- but it's a car or a detergent. As Marcuse said "products...are made into objects of the libido". Design creativity is, per se, all about stretching benefits. Let's face it, it's getting people to buy stuff they don't need, that damages the environment -- and that goes for environmentally friendlier products too.
So I came to the conclusion that you can't change the system from within, better to play the game, make some money, and put your reform efforts directly into political action designed to effect legislation that will curb excess directly. It was just too difficult to make a living working with the few companies that had really good environmental products, because there wasn't enough money there.
Don't get me started on cause marketing :-)

If that worked, it would be illegal.

But making materialism the <cite>system</cite> can only lead to misery.
Few of us are strong enough to act on that, but most

<div class=commentbody><strong>From SomethingAwful.com</strong>
http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=2291
<strong>The Worst Rock Stars Ever</strong>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dannymanic~bono_6605.jpg]
<cite>Let me help you!</cite>
2. Bono – When people in this day and age think “rock star,” they probably think Bono. Bono, on stage in his big sunglasses and his flowing shirt. Bono, with that wry little smile of his, talking to some politician about matters in the third world with a barely-detectable hint of condescension in his voice, the kind that says “we both know that I am right, but you are a fatcat and I am the voice of the people.” Bono’s impeccable hair, and Bono’s resolute chin. If we held elections for “rock star,” Bono would win. While Bono was once just the leader of a post-punk band with political pretensions, he now seems to view himself as the ambassador between rock and roll and the real world. The problem is, rock and roll does not need an ambassador to the real world, nor does it want one. Those familiar with the BBC sitcom “The Office,” which has been released on DVD in America to great popularity recently, might draw a parallel between Bono and Gareth Keenan: If being a rock star is a job, Bono thinks he is assistant regional manager, but he is just assistant to the regional manager. He is rock and roll’s most sycophantic, detestable toadie, trying to worm his way into the world of management without getting hired. For those of you who have no idea what I just said, I will provide an alternate explanation: Bono is a twat. Stop making records and go save the world off camera.
Lowest Point - The winking, self-referential failure that was “Pop.”
Mitigating Factor – Probably brings attention to some good causes, the smug bastard.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bono may be a self-important twat but he has raised a ton of money for Africa and drawn a lot of the world's attention to the crisis there. Whatever his motives are, I think ultimately he'll be judged more for his actions - and considering all the press given to truly self-important, untalented twats like Britney Spears, I don't really have a problem with Bono's grandstanding. Plus some of his music is kinda good...
Do any of us actually ever do anything for purely altruistic reasons? Think about it. If improving the world didn't actually gratify some impulse in us, who'd bother. And most of the truly dedicated bleeding hearts are a bit unbearable in person anyway. The point is to do the best you can whether you're a designer, a teacher, a corporate raider (Bill Gates comes to mind) or a stay at home mom. It all comes around.

This is a very humbling fact that I've come to realize myself, triggered by a friend's admission that she gives money to the homeless purely because it makes her feel better. I guess it's better to have impulses like that instead of the opposite.

LOL!
But seriously, it does work, and there are many ways for people to organize to "effect legislation", ranging from supporting democratic candidates who, if elected, will pass new laws, through working for NGOs who influence government policy, to various forms of civil disturbance -- ranging from awareness campaigns that shame governments into legislative action, to violent revolution, which results in a new government with new laws.
The Kyoto Protocol is actually legally binding; but the problem is that there is no penalty, so governments such as Canada's, which has signed the agreement, can ignore their committment with impunity.
<em>but most of us should be strong enough to at least admit it.</em>
Actions speak louder than words. Unless a celebrity is involved, in which case any good results can't be disentagled from the self-serving publicity. In that sense, the celebrity who speaks out on an issue is involved in cause marketing, promoting both the cause and him/herself as product.

Agreed, Nick, but if the results are good and the byproduct is positive publicity for the celebrity (or not so positive, c.f. Madonna) then who loses? The cult of celebrity is at a fever pitch right now and that's a shame, but the few that use their celebrity to promote a worthy cause - Bono, George Clooney, Tim Robbins to name a few - should still receive some credit for the results. If that's how people want to take their medicine, so be it.

Agreed. That's why all that can be asked of anyone is to do what you can— that is if you choose to.
<em>I’ll wear a Gap shirt if I find it at Goodwill. But does someone in the third world get a choice? Doubtful. Since we DO have a choice as fat Americans/Canadians/Western Europeans, we should by all means make that choice that benefits not only ourselves, but those that have no choice.</em>
While I agree with this to a point, it illustrates the code of ethics point I was trying to make. There's a trail of blood leading from many things...more than we all know. I highly doubt there's not at least one item in our closet, apartment or home that doesn't. I can own up to liking and wanting material posessions and I don't think I have to apologize for it. (BTW, Dan the tone of that reads WAY harsher than it is intended to be. I'm not making accusations because I refuse to purchase certain things for similar reasons.)
I just think it is almost pointless to pick and choose how far to go with it. We can only do what we can all live with, and we can't ask people to research every decision they choose to make. How each of us choose to help society or help ourselves is only up to us as individuals.</div>

Good point Christian. Someone said (did I read it here?) that artists and poets can't make society more just, but they can make it worth living in. I think this is the case also with designers. In their work, designers can make our world more agreeable to live in, and that's pretty wonderful in itself. </div>

Short-circuiting the system,
Who supplied Saddam with the weapons of mass destruction?
Why did the West cover up Saddam's crimes when he used them?
Why was Saddam endlessly assisted when he suppressed his own people and invaded Iran, but crushed when invaded Kuwait?
Advanced Weapons from US, UK and France were brought generously to Iraq and the Iraqi engineers were sent east and west to go under Technical training. Advanced Communication Systems were supplied to the Iraqi army just days before the war started. I was doing my National service then.
Almost all the so called Muslim and Arab countries stood by saddam. I counted more than 100 advanced Russian Tanks entering Ar-Rasheed Military Camp (now in ruins) which were gifted by KING(?) Fahad of Arab Saudi to the Iraqi army as they considered Saddam was fighting the Fire-Worshippers! on behalf of the Muslim and Arab world. That was just few days before the Iraq-Iran war.... I will never forget as long as I live what I had eyewitnessed.
Is Bush a Christian or Saddam a Muslim?
Religion was and is always exploited by the Crooks to justify their crimes.
I was granted a visa early 1986 to enter Malaysia. But when I applied for a residence there, I was asked to go and fight Iran first. One year before the invasion of Kuwait, I reported to the UNHCR in Malaysia to protect me from Saddam Intelligence following my unsuccessful assassination, but they replied that they would sponsor my trip to Iraq and take me out of Iraq if I could not make it there. When Saddam invaded Kuwait, I wrote to the News Straits times(Malaysia) to publish my Article "Fighting among the Crooks", they rejected it saying that they would publish any article that defends Saddam or Bush, the father, i.e I had to take side. When I told them that one had taken the right step in the wrong direction and the other the wrong step in the right direction, they laughed at me...
When I was jailed for overstaying, prisoners from all Malaysian races (Malay, Chinees, Indians) and religions (Islam, Buddisim, Hindu, and Seikh) used to shout at me alternately "Saddam" and "Bush". My thumb was always pointing down. Police as well prisoners were confused.
For your information, US invaded Iraq only when it made sure that Saddam was completely stripped off weapons of mass destruction and even off guns capable of hitting more than 50 Kilometers target. Rules of the Jungle: The lion does not attack save the weak or sick.
You will see the end of Saddam-Makers and Breakers.
Still have questions? All are welcome!</div>

I hate this war. And I don't even like to call it a war because there is in fact no 'enemy'. It's an invasion, an occupation. But it looks like things are changing - slowly -here in the U.S. and maybe a little reality is creeping in. Progress perhaps?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Damn. Makes me think twice about complaining about my latté in the morning.
But seriously, do you recall how the graphic designers for newspapers, magazines, etc., reacted? In Seattle, the graphic designers at the Times call themselves "Visual Journalists," basically implying that they have some say in the content. But do they really?
Your comments about the Maylasian newspaper hit the mark. Many newspapers pander to what their audience wants to hear, tickling their ears so to speak.
As cynical as this sounds, no matter how "open minded" or "objective" a publication is, nine times out of ten it ends up pushing some form of government supported propaganda. As a matter of conscience, I have the choice of refusing, but I'm in a posh American city. How about Iraq? Do they, or did they, have a choice?</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Here is the truth that will set you free and endanger my life.
It seems that it is time to leave this worthless world.
It should be noted that:
Inspite of the unsuccessful attempt on my life by agents of Saddam, I did not go to the UNHCR AGAIN to protect me after Saddam suppression to the Shia uprising (which I disapproved). Iraqis were and are still confused. They relied on America to solve their problems not on themselves. Most Iraqi freedom-fighters were happy when they were taken and looked after by the UNHCR to Arabia Saudi, but they soon realized that they were taken Prisoners of War?! Some were taken as refugees to countries like Australia, Canada and some spent more than more than 14 Years.
> Will the Americans get their way in the long run, and establish a fully democratic Iraq?
First, is democracy what the Americans and/or Iraqis are after?
Today, there are more than three hundred (300) parties in Iraq. More than 20 parties are Islamic!!! Every party is happy with its centres,
publications and free-thinkers. As long as America is in Power...
Is this Democracy? We need Managers and Engineers to build Iraq, not useless quarrelling power thirsty parties...
Believe me or not, the American will try to destroy God when the Sincere Iraqis (excluding all the parties on the surface now) begin to emphasize this point:
• Since God creates us, then He better knows our ins and outs. Consequently, He Alone does set laws and rules for us to run smoothly on earth. Man knows save little. Otherwise, He is unjust to create and leave us unguided or to be misguided by Capitalism, Communism,
Socialism or Democracy. UnGodly systems are the fruits of unGodly men. To Him we belong and to Him We return...
The Americans wanted a similar situation to be carried out in Iran with the help of ex-president Khatami. Fortunately, the true Shia Scholars tackle this problem intelligently without bloodshed. However, Slow Development was the high price the Iranians paid.
> Will I have the option of returning to Basra?
Will the Americans let me live there? By now, I have so many Iraqi enemies, because I stood from the very beginning against them including Abdul Aziz Al-Hakeem, Ibraheem Ja'fari and those of the same length. These so-called Shia are brought by the very smart Americans... Why? Remember that the Shia of Iraq fought the Shia of Iran under Saddam leadership for eight, emphasizing for 8 years,
with the (proof) of the American-made Grand Ayatollah Khoi(before Sestani). These 2 Ayatollah are Iranians, nevertheless, they were allowed to practice their activities when Saddam was in power whereas the first Iraqi scholar As-Sadr was executed and many Iraqis (of Iraqi Grandfathers) were deported to Iran on the pretext that they were Iranians after executeing their men. My family was imprisoned for one year including my little brother Firas (9 years old then) after my escape, then deported sick and empty-handed to Iran. Why were my brothers not excueted? Saddam wanted me to be in a suspicious position in the eyes of the Iranians who never stopped questioning me
because of that...
I hope you come to understand why Bush thanked Ali Sestani and how the Christians Top Leaders in Vatican/Italy have recently discovered that the Jews were not responsible for Jesus crossing!
I went to my home town beginning of 2005 to get the documents I was stripped off. There, I was introduced by my cousin who was a high-rank military officer in the Iraqi army to a British of Indian Origin named Shindi in charge of recruiting Iraqi Engineers to the American Company "Floor". He proudly showed me his diary book that was carrying the signatures of Margret Tacher and Others. When I asked him what for he came to Iraq. He answered that he came to further his study on Gilgamish 7000-years old Manuscripts! To make him understand to which place he has come, I gifted him the translation of the book "Peak of Eloquence" comprising the words of our Prophet
Successor Who ruled Iraq for 4 years 1400 years ago, ... It is a comprehensive book about the Iraqi People (rich of embarrassments)...
My next step was "Twist" and turn back to Iran after spending 3 months in the hell of Democracy...
Third, will the Americans get out of Iraq???
In short, it is not Democracy what the Americans want, but smashing the Head in Iran with the head here!
This is the lesson they cunningly input and fedback by Saddam.
As the American capitalized on the Iranian MKO to topple the Iranian government, they are capitalizing on their tools there.
As I see it, God has dragged the Americans to a place where they can neither make it nor leave...
That's how God destroys the Arrogants...
>Will the end result be a good one, despite the undesirable means by which it came to be?<
Well-established countries are complaining with rising economic and social and other problems.
How to build a country with thousands of war-disabled and mentally off (my brother Ahmad included), and millions left without education.
40% of Iraqis do not know even how to read or write their own language. Iraqis had no choice but to fix Saddam's picture on their chests and carry guns in one hand and Saddam's publications in the other. From Cradle to mass graves....
Philippine and Cuba in the time of their Dictators are paradises of freedom when compared to the Republic of fear.
The destruction was not the result of Gulf-warII only but if it was systematic and long. So, it takes more than 2 generations to recover, if the Americans allow...
Undesirable means end up with Undesirable results. Miscalculations?! God never stops calculations.
> What do you get from the media?
Gulf war I and II were fighting among the Crooks, as I clarified in my earlier email. Here I would like to add that the book tilted " The Republic of fear" which was written in the eighties by the Sameer Al-khalili was allowed to be circulated only in the state where he was living (in US) but this very book was sponsored by the Pentagon and Arabia Saudi to be translated into Arabic and circulated free of charge even in the far east. I got my Arabic copy in Malaysia!
More later!</div>

Part of the illusion - a leveraging of the cult of personality that allows the choice of replacing puppets to replace real choices for change. As long as the following story doesn't REALLY sink in, the future will remain one where the richer peons vote for systems to rape, pillage and murder the poorer peons, but of course not show any of that on TV.

Note: not too long ago it was 5%. So don't give us this bullshit about the West improving the world, not least gradually through democracy. In fact, replacing Rumsfeld with Robert Gates only makes your game harder to expose and defeat.
China has now become the world's main hope, and ironically
only because of the centrality of materialism in the West.

<div class=commentbody>Every human is materialistic. But when you make materialism the driving force of a political system (as in the US) you become vulnerable to anybody who becomes richer than you (China). Basically China will own you, because you're for sale.
Furthermore: every society has a materialistic element, but the ones (like China) that reserve their highest and deepest pride for their history and culture are more in tune with what humanity needs, I feel. When people point out the rampant materialism in China's new middle class, it is because it's such a contrast to the rest of the Chinese mindframe. In the West in general and the US in particular, there's nothing to contrast materialism against - everything else has been made secondary, and in fact subservient.
The fact that China is not democratic is what makes it so promising.
Contrast it to India, the other Eastern giant, which is falling behind.

<div class=commentbody>Re: the original questions
Designers (graphic and industrial) have a large impact in a few specific ways, but I would hardly hold us up as a bastion of the greater good. These ways are:
1) Our ability to communicate informtion and ideas effectively, speak to the world via the mouth of large institutions, and to use visual voice to cajole, deceive, encourage, and perhaps inform people without their conscious understanding. For good or ill.
2) We are often directing the actions of mass production. If I choose to use soy ink on a run of 100,000 brochures, my tiny decision is multiplied outward. Now apply that to, say, the designer of the iPod or its packaging. I wouldn't say that we're masters of industry, but we do shape large-scale consumption to a point. But we're often focused on the appearance and the client's opinion, so we rarely fight for the larger picture.
3) Our role in moving popular visual culture. Trends in design are often reflections of other practices, but also influence them. But we're hardly at the top of the food chain.
I agree with Terry's original post. It's easy to be high-minded, but that usually comes from being middle-class and ignorant (I include myself in this group). Not buying Nike is a statement, but it's hardly the pinnacle of social responsibility. Try not buying anything from Procter & Gamble, or Monsanto. It's nearly impossible and those companies have their hands in far more questionable endeavours than Nike. Wage slaves in your sweatshops is a pretty minor offense in the grand scheme. Unfortunately.
I believe that we, as designers, should strive to keep our own houses in order and tell each other to do so. I find that trying to design The Poster That Changed the World is pretty ridiculous, as it usually takes a large institution behind it to make any difference. Designers are usually too cute/witty for their own good to be real movers of social change. Though there are certainly exceptions. Real change is typically unglamorous and unlauded. Few make it big in design being either of those things.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Having now caught up with the posts, I'm finding the discussions of the Middle East by those who live(d) there fascinating. It's no wonder that most Americans cannot understand the Middle East. Americans have such a hard time reconciling long-standing, pervasive, intense, violent conflict and the presence of human beings with minds, hearts, and modernity. There's a tendency to diminish the people of a region to a caricature of their government and extremists. Then just throw the word "tribal" in there...such a mental disconnect for people in over here.</div>

China is less homogenous than many think. It is autocratic in structure, though, which is dangerous. The future of the world will depend a lot on the wisdom of US and Chinese leaders in creating effective cooperation rather than conflict. I wonder whether both sides will be up to the challenge. </div>

"Humans wander through space-time whether of the city or the printed page--where the graphic messages of the visualist appear. They encounter them, accept them, or reject them. On that contingency is based all the talent of the creative person, the user of fleeting moments, salvager of an interstitial availability of the individual in the spaces and times in which he or she acts and lives."
"…strategist of the miniscule in our relationship with things…"
"…graphic design acts as a social amplifier of the messages, attempting to tell well what someone has to say: "go to such and such a place," "do such and such," "understand such and such a process," "accept such and such a value."
"…the world is a labyrinth that must be unravelled, a text that must be deciphered […] The function of the designer is to increase the legibility of the world…"
"Graphic design […] adresses itself to the glance the individual casts on the world, a glance that precedes the action performed…"
"…the languages of writing […] are indefinitely sequential and present themselves as a series of signs on a line, instead of a heirarchy of elements on an ideogram or on the surface of the page. […] It is by the ability to master this (heirarchical) language that the graphic designer can impose on the world an educational value."[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul, I don't see China's impending domination as rosy. It is simply a desire, in fact a need, for change, for a correction of this horrible, precipitous downward spiral engineered by the West, where the spiritual (by which I categorically don't mean religious) half of the human reality has been subverted to the material half*. You know, I wouldn't even half mind <cite>that</cite> if everybody would simply admit it. All I'm really professing is awareness. With awareness, things become as good as possible.
* To draw a typographic parallel, I would say it's
like only having display fonts and no text fonts.
And China, just like the US now, will be in no mood for negotiation when the time comes. Things happen in cycles, and one day, yes, we will need to get rid of China too. William's view: now <cite>that's</cite> rosy!

<div class=commentbody>Aziz, now <em>that</em> I understood, and in the process I also understand you much better.
This thread has taken a very interesting turn, and inadvertently illustrated my original point. What some of us consider pressing matters, may not be to another.
Take note people, and I will highlight this so an administrator sees this:
<strong>There needs to be a printed record of this thread. Many if possible.</strong>
What has been written here is unprecedented (at least to me). I have found out more here today than I have in any of the news media for several years. I expect this thread to disappear in the not too distant future.

<div class=commentbody>Change is inevitable Hrant.
One day you and I will be living in the Peoples Republic of California (I hope).
It will be very interesting when this empire finally falls.
Will it go relatively quietly, like Russian communism?
Or will it be catastrophic, like German national socialism?
I suspect the latter.
I don't think people will easily give up the economic system that is closest to human nature.

<div class=commentbody>If humans are not just animals, materialism cannot be enough. It can even be argued that animals aren't that simple either. Consider for example that a Dalmatian will physically go berserk if it's the only pet in the household, no matter how good the food and shelter that it has. Anyway, no matter what we're really made of, awareness is our best hope, and we have very little of it now. We have tons of <cite>information</cite>, but clearly that's not translating to awareness. In fact maybe the deluge of information is meant to impede awareness.
Yes, it is interesting to speculate how the current empire will go. Will it implode gracefully and be left with a viable core, or will it be another Rome? I think it's dependent mostly on age, on heritage. China for example I can picture imploding gracefully when the time comes (in fact one could argue it's already done that once) but Rome was apparently too young, too arrogant, to really survive at all; and the US is even younger, and almost as arrogant.

<div class=commentbody>I fully agree.
Materialism does not fulfill, yet we have seen a serious rise in it, especially amongst the young, who are supposed to be our idealists. That has been my experience at least.
The flood of information is carefully constructed, one pitch at a time, by the millions of PT Barnums that marketing has unleashed. That's why I was so negative about the original question, because I know that designers at this point are underlings of the marketing department.
And if your stream of information is constructed by marketers, then what other conclusion can you come to?

<div class=commentbody>Maybe it's just me but I don't mind Aziz's poetry every now and then, if that's Aziz's way of expressing himself, so be it. Diversity is a good thing and in my opinion it should be welcomed. As far as animated gifs are concerned they are annoying, especially animated avatars (although some of them are brilliant).
I certainly don't think Aziz's poems are a waste of bandwidth. Speaking of bandwidth...it's the 2nd time this week people have been calling others a "a waste of bandwidth". It's becoming a very trendy insult! "Look at you! You are such a waste of bandwidth!".
I remember at school we had a friend who was a pain in the arse, he always had this silly wolly hat on so we called him a waste of wool. Sorry for the digression.
Another cool insult is "you are such a Renuisance!". We should definetely keep a printed record of that one!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here is one of my experiences that I would like to share here:
__________________________________________________________
In 1987, Henry Kesenger visited Malaysia for 2 weeks to meet the 9 Sultans (Kings)... Needless to say, the visit could outrage Malays. On that day, to divert the Malays attention, "Berita Harian" — the Ruling Party newspaper— came out reading:
"Kesenger in Malaysia" in a dying font inside a small square at the top left hand corner, and the lower half of the frontpage and in eye-catching font was covered with what translates into "Disappearance of the Verses of the Holy Book".
The newspaper claimed that one of the religious teacher in one of the villages eyewitnessed the lines of the Holy Book flying away (never explained how) as she was scan-reading them.
And the Opposition Muslim Party began their Religious/Political campaign...
For 14 successive days, newspapers were pouring oil on fire...
Was teaching Arabic Language then at Al-Taufiqqya Private School in a village in Kedah/North.
A member of the State Assembly named Ustaz (Scholar) Zahari came to see me in companion with a number of PAS Islamic Party followers...
Ustaz asked: "Do you see what happened a sign of the ereafter?" "What is your opinion?"
He reiterated verses of the Holy Book and began interpreting them as he (mis)understood and insisted on reply.
Replied questioning:
• Has All the 30-parts of Holy Book disappeared or a part of it?
• Have the same pages disappeared from the same edition or different editions?
• Is there any possibility of misprinting?
• How many countries witnessed this Miracle beside Malaysia?
• What is God's Wisdom behind taking the Holy Book back to him?
• Why this happens now, not before? What is special in this day?
Before finishing my last question, one of Scholar's followers jumped to finish me for being ungodly. Fortunately, I was saved in time by other followers.
Afterwards, when Henry Kesenger finished his task with the 9 Malaysia Kings and the issue went out of control, the PM, Mahateer Mohammed, ordered an investigating committee to be formed for the matter...
Two months later, the committee discovered the Misprinting!!!

Amazing how a printing mistake can be used in a crisis. In your case the price for such a mistake could have been higher than what a reprint would cost.

<div class=commentbody>This kind of slight of hand is disgusting. It's a disgrace.
Do we as designers have a role to play in society? I think Bringhurst said it better than I ever could:
<strong><cite>Elements of Typographic Style</cite></strong>
<strong><cite>First Principles § 1.1.3</cite></strong>
<cite>The same alphabets and page designs can be used for a biography of Mohandas Gandhi and for a manual on the use and deployment of biological weapons. Writing can be used both for love letters and for hate mail, and love letters themselves can be used for manipulation and extortion as well as to bring delight to body and soul. Evidently there is nothing inherently noble and trustworthy in the written or printed word. Yet generations of men and women have turned to writing and printing to house and share their deepest hopes, perceptions, dreams and fears. It is to them, not the extortionist – nor to the opportunist or the profiteer – that the typographer must answer.</cite>

<div class=commentbody>True creative expression should never be censored...
Did you not learn from impressionism - no matter how many paintings did not get the official French government stamp -- it didn't matter. Artists have always struggled -- a government not allowing them to sell their art - only helped them to be more creative... There was something motivating these great painters - and here - more than 100 years later - we are still enjoying them.
