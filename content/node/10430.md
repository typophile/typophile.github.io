body: I was sitting in a presentation the other day- so I know that the font I&#39;m
  about to discuss is included with either Macs or Microsoft Office. I couldn&#39;t
  help wincing at the projector screen.  <BR> <BR>I mean, this font was awful. Serifs
  were inconsistently proportioned, which gave it a jagged and flawed feeling. I left
  the conference room with a big headache. <BR> <BR>The most notable trait of this
  font was that the Q was simply an O with a squiggle beneath it- there was no connection
  between the ellipse and the bottom stroke. <BR> <BR>My morbid curiosity made me
  wonder what font it was. Remember, I saw it in a Powerpoint presentation, so I doubt
  that it&#39;s uncommon. Apart from the Q, the key feature of the font is the serifs
  that wound the reader. Does anyone know what this font may be?
