body: 'This font is a helvetica/univers/franklin gothic descendant. It seems like
  I''ve seen it before. The R doesn''t have a curve on its lower right hand side like
  Helvetica. The numbers also have a unique style. This font might also be forced
  italic. '

  body: Looks very much like it. There's a very good possibility that it just might
    be Chalet Cologne. Anyone else agree?
