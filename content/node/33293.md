body: I am in the process of working my way into an Junior Art Director position.  I
  am wondering what is a good salary range to ask?  It is not a full-blown Art Director
  job so I can't ask too much, but if I don't ask enough they will not take me seriously.  If
  I get the job it will be my first job in this position, so I am not super experienced.  I
  am also in a good-sezed metropolitan area (Denver, Colorado).  Is $35,000 too much
  for a rookie Junior Art Director?

    the bat, $35,000 sounds at least $10k too little. I'd say mid-$40k range and let
    them make you an offer from there. \r\n\r\nDo some research on the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics Web site, which is more reliable than salry surveys. You can find figures
    for Art Directors or Senior Designers working in the Denver Metropolitan area,
    and then break those figures down by industry (publishing, advertising, etc.)\r\n\r\nI
    believe the concept of a Junior Art Director or Associate Art Director is kind
    of a tough one in terms of figuring out salaries. Most places seem to stick with
    Junior Designer, Senior Designer, Art Director and Creative Director.\r\n\r\nTrust
    me, unless the amount you ask for is extremely high, employers will not be put
    off by your request. They expect them and they will always come down to a lower
    figure. So aim high."

    I do in Raleigh, NC for a higher salary + pretty good benefits, granted with a
    few years experience.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

    to these sorts of discussions. Taking about prices and salaries in a forum such
    as this could be construed as price fixing (at least under US law). I think Typophile
    is treading on very shaky ground allowing these sorts of discussions.\r\n\r\nJames"

    I kind of doubt it. ;o)"

  body: "Thanks, James. Perhaps this is a good place to reiterate that the views expressed
    herein are the views of their individual authors and not Typophile, its moderators
    or owners.\r\n\r\nThat said, getting career insight and guidance from designer
    peers is one of the reasons a community like Typophile can thrive. \r\n\r\nThetophus,
    your question is a common one. I do think that your best bet in these matters
    is to go with a reputable source; the AIGA has been posting their Salary Survey
    for years and would provide the best guidance. Their document may also provide
    insight into your local area to know what are competitive rates."
