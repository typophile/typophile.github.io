body: "Hi Everyone!\r\nI'm trying to find a typeface to replace Requiem. I'll be using
  it at approximately 8-14pt with abundantly open kerning. I'm using it in a way that
  requires the characters to be bold or black. Trajan is nice but I'm wondering if
  there is anything else out there. I really love the elegance and Renaissance aspect
  of Requiem and the numbers make my heart flutter. I'll be using this for page numbers
  as well so the numbers are important.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    needs a \u201Cbold or black\u201D text version of it."

  body: "There is the classical, transitional Roman, Schneider Antiqua, Werner Schneider
    (Berthold). Light to bold, with non-aligning figures. Lovely waisting forms but
    not in the Trajan column ethos. A contemporary interpretation of the forms without
    the perspective distortion of Trajan..\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "The true Trajan forms were first done with Brush and then chiseled, according
    to Fr. Catich's research and trials... the serif being the cleanup stroke. See
    The Origin of The Serif . I think the Requiem caps are in part, the bowls, a hybrid
    of Old Style and Transitional.\r\n\r\nClassica and Prestige owe a tremendous debt
    to the Zapf tradition.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: Hmm. Ok. More mud on my face. What about switching to something a little newer
    and trying a neo-classical? Something like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/porchez/ambroise_bold/">Ambroise</a>.
    Or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=penumbra&x=0&y=0">Penumbra</a>.
    And if Water Titling might work, so might <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1504">Brioso
    Pro</a>.

  body: "Just sort of hanging out on this one Miss Tiffany. Brioso Pro is phenomenal,
    too bad Adobe did not have their marketing team on top of this one, Robert did
    a phenomenal job on it. Under appreciated! By the way... Classica and Prestige
    owe more to the chisel edged pen than the brush. Palatino, Arrighi et. al.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I took this damn craft up the bible was Edmund Arnold, Ink on Paper... Modern,
    Old Style, and Transitional. Bringhurst, a true Canadian treasure, confuses me
    with all the subdivisions! But a better book on typography has never been written.
    Should be a required read for anybody getting into this field!\r\n\r\nMichael"
