  <BR> <BR>custom typeface work for Ernst &amp; Young. How exactly does this work?  <BR>
  <BR>Let&#39;s say a large corporate customer wants a specific type family for 200
  CPUs, but doesn&#39;t want to shell out for a full-family, 200-CPU license. Can
  they hire a type designer to design a &#39;similar&#39; face for a flat fee and
  use it however they see fit on as many CPUs as they can plug in? <BR> <BR>And how
  long would it take to design such a similar family of type? And space it and kern
  it? That&#39;s &#42;a lot&#42; of work. Anyone know how this works? <BR> <BR>bj
  <BR> <BR>this concludes this edition of WNL, wednesday night links &#43; google
  links = zzzzz <BR> <BR>any volunteers for some more links next wednesday night?
  WNL is specifically designed to give typophiles something to do at work on Thursday
  and Friday.

    <BR> <BR>Common practice. <BR> <BR>&#62; give typophiles something to do at work
    on Thursday and Friday. <BR> <BR>Actually, it seems that&#39;s when most people
    do any real work: <BR><A HREF="http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2002/July/weekday.php"
