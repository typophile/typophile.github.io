  story behind Times New Roman <em><a href=\"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/times-new-roman-medium.aspx\">Medium</a></em>?
  How recent is this addition to the TNR family? What was its purpose? <dl>It is a
  well-known fact that Times <em><a href=\"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/times-new-roman-semibold.aspx\">Semi-Bold</a></em>
  (Series 421) was developed by Monotype Corporation in 7-pt. size, at the request
  of CUP, for a Cambridge edition of the Bible; the year was 1936.\r\n\r\nThe Medium\u2019s
  design copyright is dated 1988. There is a lot more recent Times New Roman cut,
  <em><a href=\"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/times-new-roman-seven.aspx\">Seven</a></em>,
  optically optimised but different in design from both the Semi-Bold and the Medium;
  its glyph shapes are more faithful to the letter-forms of the original <a href=\"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/times-new-roman-regular.aspx\">Times
  New Roman</a> (Series 327) than Semi-Bold\u2019s. The Seven\u2019s design copyright
  is dated 1988 too\u2026 There was also Series 610, cut in 6\xBD size in 1959 \u2018for
  the exclusive use of the Oxford University Press\u2019 but that\u2019s another story
  in its entirety.</dl>"
