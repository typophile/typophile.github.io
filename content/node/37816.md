    motion.\r\n\r\nBtw, have you seen the Brazil Inspired MachoBox from MK12 and the
    Pulp Fiction? \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgqbdBnD1k\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syf8olcM0z4

  body: "Hey,\r\nI liked very much the beginning and the music; also you seem to have
    grasped some of the very first visual tricks of typography based animation. Since
    motion graphics is [[http://www.motions.it|my main source of income]], I can maybe
    tell you a couple of things I noticed wathing the video. I can gather you worked
    in flash, right? To achieve a more interesting look you could (if you aren't already)
    begin to investigate After Effects: the software isn't as simple as flash but
    so are the results.\r\nWorking in AE can give you a lot more control to the dynamics
    of the animation (I noticed some unsure passages here anad there), and something
    crucial to motion graphics in general and type animation in particular: motion
    blur, an often overlooked detail that can spell the difference between 'rich'
    or 'poor' animation. In addition to that AE lets you animate characters in a 3d-planes
    world... not that i don't like the 2d animation of your movie: personally I prefer
    it almost always over 3d, but certainly the possibility of 3d is something that
    opens up a lot of ideas in type animation.\r\nOne great way to work with type
    is to make typography animation of dialogues of famous films: lately [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syf8olcM0z4|the
    great one from Pulp Fiction]] has been making the rounds, a very good example
    of what I mean (though, personally, I think that adding the original sound somewhat
    makes things too easy: if it works without the speech, then it's truly great).

  body: "The flow is really nice.\r\n\r\nThe variety of motions is pleasant and I
    like the end.\r\n\r\nAE might be a good next step. But it's a big step. Both in
    terms of concepts to grip and in terms of cost.\r\n\r\nI could have enjoyed a
    slightly faster pace actually. And maybe more surprises.\r\n\r\nWhat's next?"

    of concepts to grip and in terms of cost.</cite>\r\nI don't really know the legal
    side of it, but for type animation you are basically set with AE 6 or 6.5 (I think
    even 5 is ok, but later they introduced the 'text' object), so if you can manage
    to get an old version (used or obsolete), that would be almost just as good as
    CS3.\r\n<cite>I could have enjoyed a slightly faster pace actually. And maybe
    more surprises.</cite>\r\nI agree, but I think he chose to stay very close to
    the music. I wonder if he worked on the completed music or had some kind of creative
    feedback with the composer."

  body: "Thank all of you for your kind comments:\r\n\r\nsatya: Yes I knew the Pulp
    Fiction Animation. Really impressive - on a whole different level. I haven't seen
    the mk12 animation though. Thank you for the link.\r\n\r\nnicola: You are damn
    right with the AE thing. Though I would have used Combustion rather then After
    Effects.\r\nBut I did the whole piece in 3dsmax. The stupid thing is that this
    scene is just one real scene. I'm not scaling anything - it's just a camera that
    is flying through the words.\r\nBecause of that I had some really big problems
    with the animation, since all 3d Packages tend to have problems with really small
    values. The clock at the beginning for example is around 100 km in size - compared
    to the smallest sentence (\"to see the truth\") which is 2 mm in size. That's
    too much of a difference for any 3d package I think. So I should have used AE
    in the first place, as you said. I could have done the editing (or beat matching)
    there on the fly as well.\r\nAnd the beat matching was my problem as well. I had
    a version with motion blur. But it was hard to control, because it was too much
    in most of the scenes, because of the extreme zooms. You are probably right, but
    I left it out with intention (together with film grain, dark corners and other
    fancy effects) - to see the crystal clear truth you know ;)\r\nYou work is top
    notch. I have concentrated on 3danimation but will damn sure get closer to motion
    design... it's such a powerful field (as it becomes obvious on your site)\r\nthanks
    for your suggestions.\r\n\r\npaul d hunt: :D Thank you for the link. It is brilliant.
    'Love it!\r\n\r\nEben Sorkin: Thank you. What do you mean with more surprises?\r\nYeah
    the pace was really hard. It's hard to get an idea how fast people read... and
    I didn't want people to stress too much when they read it. By that it turned a
    tad too slow probably.\r\nNext is... well a lot of projects going on - this was
    more a weekend job... check my website and blog for updates :) http://www.alexanderlehmann.net\r\n\r\nThe
    music was done and final before I started working on this. This is a compliment
    though - since it really seems to tie in great. :)"
