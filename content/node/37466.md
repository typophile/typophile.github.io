body: "At my current freelance gig, we are having some issues with forced small caps
  in Adobe InDesign CS2. (It may be a conflict with Extensis Suitcase X1, too.)\r\n\r\nWhat
  happens is this: onscreen, the small caps look fine, but sometimes they print as
  gibberish text, or boxes with X's... My solution so far has been to quit and then
  restart InDesign, which does the trick.\r\n\r\nHas anybody else seen this happen?
  Any solutions, other than buying fonts with true small caps? (It's not my call to
  do that here.)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nR."

  body: I can't say I have seen the problem, but then I would rather loose my left
    arm than use faux small caps in something I felt was important. I would look at
    this problem as an opportunity. Tell whoever makes such decisions that due to
    this technical problem, if they want small caps, they should buy a proper font
    with designed small caps.
