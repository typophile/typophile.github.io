  body: Many years ago, Laurence Penney made a little tool called TTFtoSFP, while
    allowed one to quickly make a size-specific SFP bitmap font from a TTF. It was
    a small and elegantly simple little program. I'm not sure if it is currently available,
    but have directed Laurence's attention to this thread.

  body: "Thanks for drawing me here, John. You speak the truth: I did make such a
    program. It worked fine for making SFP fonts in the Windows Latin 1 character
    set.\r\n\r\nI usually sold it along with Striker, a little program to edit SFP
    bitmaps, for \xA3200. This is probably too much cash for a program that hasn't
    been updated since around 1997. I might decide to make both programs free from
    now on... let me think about that for a mo'.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/striker_3895.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttftosfp_3437.gif]\r\n"
