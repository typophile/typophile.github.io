    for Apple (if I'm reading the following correctly), but it was adopted by Apple
    for inclusion in it's System 7 operating software.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/overview/\r\n\r\nIt
    exists as a webfont as well, but is firmly rooted in the print world.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      it says the typeface was designed for Apple Computer. I understand unlike Garamond
      or Baskerville, the font never existed in metal form so perhaps that is what
      they meant when they say it was designed for the digital age. However, couldn't
      they also mean it was designed to be viewed on screen (as opposed to digital
      typesetting intended for print)?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm questioning this is cause
      I set a page in Hoefler and my teacher recommended I change it because she said
      Hoefler Text was intended for web viewing."

    yes, it's a little known fact that Sir Tim and Jonathan Hoefler worked back to
    back over at CERN in those rainy days of 1991...\r\n"

    before 1995 because the &lt;font&gt; tag was introduced in Netscape only in 1995
    according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography#Web_Fonts. According
    to the same link, a font downloading system appeared only in 1997 with Internet
    Explorer. \r\n\r\nAnd, if I rely on http://typophile.com/node/104185#comment-559045,
    Hoefler's web service is available only since july 2013.\r\n"

    I should not use [Font X] in [Medium Y] because it was designed for [Medium Z]\"
    people should just say, \"use a different font because I find the one you used
    hard to read\" and stop trying to sound clever. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Pealwah, your teacher needs to do her homework.\r\n\r\nThe font was designed
    for print, not the web\u2014it only became a web font much later. It was created
    to bring \"fine typography\" to the the realm of digital fonts.\r\n\r\nFrom the
    link I previously posted:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When Jonathan Hoefler founded the
    company in 1989, digital typography was in its infancy. Few of the great type
    foundries had embraced electronic publishing in any significant way, and those
    that had were just beginning to tentatively remaster their most famous fonts for
    use on personal computers. Manufacturing their most important faces first, at
    a time when their production processes were at their weakest, meant that some
    of the world\u2019s greatest typefaces were quickly becoming some of the world\u2019s
    worst fonts. It\u2019s no wonder that mossbacked traditionalists were so skeptical
    of the computer.\r\n\r\nWhile the market for digital type was untested, the possibilities
    of the medium were apparent. For those font users willing to submit to annoying
    workarounds (remember the \u201Cexpert set?\u201D), digital type offered the potential
    for fonts to be not merely as good as traditional ones, but demonstrably better
    than anything that had gone before. Hoefler Text, designed in 1991, was an opening
    salvo in the fight for fine typography.\r\n\r\nFollowing on the heels of the Adobe
    Originals program, which had just begun to introduce designers to such far-out
    concepts as \u201Cold-style figures\u201D and \u201Csmall caps,\u201D Hoefler
    Text resuscitated a number of other traditions that had once been central to fine
    printing: extended ligature sets, the engraved capitals of the early twentieth
    century, and the arabesques of the renaissance. Hoefler Text even invented a few
    traditions of its own, such as case-specific punctuation and italic small caps,
    and worked to expand the reach of digital typography beyond the United States
    by including a wealth of foreign symbols and accents.\r\n\r\nHoefler Text\u2019s
    steadfast agenda sparked the interest of developers at Apple, where a fledgling
    technology called \u201CTrueType GX\u201D was being created with the goal of making
    fine typography not only available to everyone, but effortless to use. Apple commissioned
    us to further expand the fonts, and licensed Hoefler Text for inclusion in System
    7, the Macintosh operating system. While GX never emerged as a viable font format
    for designers, it did fulfill its original promise of turning Hoefler Text\u2019s
    \u201Cadvanced features\u201D into a new baseline for digital typography. In the
    years since, small caps and old-style figures have become standard issue with
    the best text faces from all of the world\u2019s great type foundries.</blockquote>"
