  body: "Concurring with Kevin on Luxury Text Bold for the serif 'RADIANCE' with /E
    crossbar slightly modified (trapezoidal for Luxury Text, rectangular for your
    sample).\r\nFor the sans, judging from some small details (/S curved shape, /A
    crossbar low position, /E stems equal width...), I'd probably go for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima
    Nova]]."
