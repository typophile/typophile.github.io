body: "I drove by the van of this company today and it had an unusually tasteful selection
  of typefaces used for the logo and their tag line. \r\n\r\nI couldn't get a shot
  then, but here's an image I pulled off their website. The sample is very small and
  quite bad, I know, my apologies. If this doesn't work, I will drive by their office
  on the weekend and make a proper photo of the signage on the van.\r\n\r\nIf it's
  of any help - the sans is slightly rounded, but no as much as, say, [[http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/omnes_pro|Omnes]].
  What confuses me is a fairly large x-height and wide(r) /a/. I just quickly ran
  out of typefaces to check because of that.\r\n\r\nAny ideas ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mikeartee_3632.jpg]"
