  used by Martini&Rossi for their new logo: it reminds me Gotham Black, but it is
  slightly different (R, different heights...).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if that font
  is on sale?\r\n\r\nYou can find the logo here:\r\n[[http://www.controventogroup.com/immagini/martini.jpg]]\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKhaa"

    it. The M is bad, as is the A, but the really stand-out  monster is the R - especially
    the really lousy straight to curve transitions of the inner bowl, the too thick
    lower horizontal, not to mention the hideous leg. How was this ever passed as
    final artwork?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy would you want to buy it Alexandros? it's CRAP!"

  body: "I wouldn't ( =D ), it was just a way to ask you if that was a font available
    on sale or made just for Martini.\r\n\r\nMaybe would be better asking you about
    Gotham similar fonts: what would you suggest?"
