  Octava</a> resembles slightly <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octavian/">Octavian</a>.
  Compare Octavian 72 pt with Octava 60 pt. Even the names just might have something
  in common?

    and Kindersley&#39;s &#39;Octavian&#39; are completely different. <BR>Ciao, <BR>Fabrizio

    gasoline and light a match?  <BR>Anyway I insist that in total darkness they look
    pretty much the same.
