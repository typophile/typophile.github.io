It seems like a well intentioned, but pointless inclusion, and well, a little beyond the scope of a type designer&rsquo;s job.  could a designer seriously contemplate taking any kind of action against some one who used his or her fonts to express thoughts, he or she disagrees with?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I suppose it depends on how subjective the terms are and if they could hold up under a legal microscope. Theoretically the licensor can put whatever restrictions they want in the EULA and, if it&rsquo;s written well, can hold the licensee accountable once they&rsquo;ve agreed to those terms. Whether or not that is a practical reality is another story.</p>
<p>I once had a conversation with the cartoonist &lt;a href=http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=211&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=62&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;Itemid=62&gt;Chris Ware</a> and I asked if he had ever considered translating any of his wonderful lettering styles in to typefaces. He said he came very close to doing so once, but ultimately decided against it because he didn&rsquo;t want to see his work used for cigarette ads or other things that he didn&rsquo;t agree with. He certainly could have attempted to thwart such usage in the license, but I&rsquo;m sure he realized, from a practical standpoint, it can be tricky to enforce restrictions beyond a certain point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been curious if there have ever been any licenses which attempted to restrict how the type was set to ensure it was used as intended – restrictions of size, spacing, capitalization, media, colorization, etc… like a legally instituted style guide.</p>

<p>In my opinion those restrictions are more useful than strictly forbidding embedding. Well, design is not the same as art, but in case of art the artist should have the right to forbid the misuse of his pieces of art, because it is not necessarily recognizable for the public anymore, if the piece of art is shown in a context, that is in contradiction to the intention of the piece of art.</p>
<p>I assume, that, when the idea of EULA for digital products was born, the primary intention was money, but I can say for material pieces of art, sculptures for example, that the artist also can declare a license restriction with regard to the context, in which the piece of art is exhibited. In other words the artist could say: When you “buy” this sculpture, you are allowed to permanently possess it (if I don’t need it for an exhibition), but I remain the owner. In this case the fact, that sculptures (those ones, that are founded [in bronze for example]) are limited to a certain number of pieces, becomes a special meaning.</p>
<p>As more the typeface is a piece of art, as more such a license restriction can become useful. In case of a body text typeface it would be absurd, because the function “content transporter” dominates the meaning of the typeface (Otherwise it would be not a good body text typeface.).</p>
<p>Lol, in case of DTL I think they try to materialize their digital typefaces with the help of the price. The price makes the fonts to unicums.</p>

<p>They can forbid the use of their fonts for any thing that promotes the use of white bread, and edible oil products for all I care, it just seems to me that if you want your EULA to be taken seriously, you are better off sticking to restrictions that at least sound like they would have a realistic chance of being taken seriously. Such a clause dilutes the purpose of the document, I think.</p>

<p>Yes and no. Mostly I just want to keep my fonts away from hate groups and cults like Focus on the Family, LDS, the moonies, and the Knights of Columbus. I specifically wrote that clause because of the bigotry coming out of LDS in recent years. The way I see it, when even the normally warm-and-fuzzy Mormons start acting like shits it’s time for sensible people to start building walls around them.</p>
<p>But even if I did not find a religious or political use offensive I would still charge them more than corporate licensees because both have absurd amounts of money to throw around and a willingness to spend wildly, even recklessly.</p>

<p>True. And if art becomes a market-oriented business, it is only art unto itself. Art is a dictatorship in a sort. Naturally an artist can accept an order, but if he has a soul, he cannot bend it. If he can bend it, he is not an artist, but a whore. Except he clearly says, that he is a designer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The idea of ‘moral’ clauses in EULAs is an interesting one, although it seems to me that what we&rsquo;re really talking about is exclusionary clauses targeting people or groups of people with particular ideas or involved in particular activities, and such clauses may or may not be defined in terms of morality. I might decide that my fonts are not to be used to promote scrapbooking, but not because I consider scrapbooking immoral. People find it easy to dress their prejudices up as morality, but I figure its easiest to simply avoid the moral debate in intellectual property licensing and simply be as bloody-minded as one is willing to be seen to be (and is willing to enforce). Alternatively, just put the stuff out there and if it ends up being used in a way of which you disapprove, use that occasion as an opportunity to speak out.</p>
<p>My moral code is summarised by the statement ‘Don’t be an arsehole’ &ndash; or as Christ more politely put it, ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’ &ndash;, but I&rsquo;m not sure how to frame that in terms of a EULA.</p>
<p>James: <em>Mostly I just want to keep my fonts away from hate groups and cults like Focus on the Family, LDS, the moonies, and the Knights of Columbus. I specifically wrote that clause because of the bigotry coming out of LDS in recent years. The way I see it, when even the normally warm-and-fuzzy Mormons start acting like shits it’s time for sensible people to start building walls around them.</em></p>
<p>This is sad, and also ironic, because if you talk to e.g. many Christians about how they view secular culture, you&rsquo;ll get a similar response: they are frightened and feel that walls need to be built to protect the values that they see under threat. The result is an acutely bitter divide based on mutual fear and distrust, which finds expression in both political and cultural terms. I am reminded of the frequent exhortation of John Paul II, ‘Be not afraid!’ &ndash; not because there is nothing to be frightened of but because he knew, having lived through the Nazi occupation and communist repression in Poland, that people often do terrible things when they feel threatened.</p>
<p>One of the things that I love most about type and typography &ndash; at least text typography &ndash; is its intrinsic connection with dialogue, with the exchange of ideas. One of the reasons I am less interested in display typography is that it seems more like shouting than conversation. The trouble with building walls, defensive though they may be, is that you end up with either the silence of separate solitudes or people shouting at each other over the ramparts. The opportunities for conversation are greatly diminished and, hence, so are the opportunities for typography to do what it does, i.e. articulate that conversation in written form.</p>
<p>There are certainly things I hope not to see my typefaces used to promote &ndash; things ranging from tacky and tasteless to moral evil &ndash;, but I don&rsquo;t seek to prevent such use.</p>

<p>It’s a cute sentiment, but it doesn’t work when the moral compass of the other side is guides them to treat other people as subhuman. Ghandi succeeded at turning the other cheek because the British came to find the idea of pummeling defenseless Indians repugnant. When the Buddhists in Burma tried it they got their brains dashed out. Tolerance has limits.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Early in my career I worked at a NYC type shop that had close ties to a fringe political movement. Almost everyone in the shop was a committed member of the cause, except me. Part of my job was to design their political publications. Some of those designs are still being used all these years later. That experience gave me a little taste of fringe movements and their particular brand of insanity.</p>

<p>Having it both ways allows me to leave the door open to the vast majority of religious and political uses that are entirely benign. As I noted above, what really made me go this route was seeing Mormons, who have a deep cultural memory of the dangers of both being victims and perpetrators of discrimination, promoting discriminatory laws. But that is an extreme and not the general behavior of people with religious and political inclinations. So rather than just slam a door in their face, I closed the door gently and left a nice big knocker on it for anyone interested in pleasant discourse.</p>

Thus, a clause like &ldquo;This spreadsheet may not be used in the design of nuclear weapons systems&rdquo; is something one isn&rsquo;t going to be able to enforce against the Chinese government.</p>
<p>A typeface is a somewhat different matter, since when you use a typeface in printed matter, you are, in a way, identifying the designer of the typeface with that matter. Or at least it can seem like that. But I can also see how liberal use of such clauses may be an impetus for the United States, at least, to continue hesitating on protecting typeface designs.</p>

<p>Many, many years ago, back when the comp.fonts newsgroup was a reasonable place to have a discussion about typography, I received a phone call from a man with a southern US accent who has stumbled across something I had written there and was seeking advice on typography for a book he was self-publishing. He was using Times New Roman and, since he knew very little about typography, wanted to check that this was an appropriate choice. What kind of book is it? I inquired, thinking that I might be able to suggest something more distinctive and attractive than Times. ‘It&rsquo;s about politics,’ he explained, ‘My name is David Duke.’</p>
<p>Times New Roman, I assured him, would do just fine.</p>

<p>I do not sell goods. I license type for use as I see fit, and when I do I am—in a very limited way—taking part in the creation of whatever is created using my fonts. Thus, as a printer has the right to refuse to print religious materials that he finds offensive, say, <em>The Satanic Bible</em>, I believe that I have a right to refuse to license my type for a printing of <em>The Satanic Bible</em>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James M., I believe that what happened is that either the artist: a. asked the candidate not to use the song because they were against them&ndash;a courtesy thing, not law, or b. the candidate hadn&rsquo;t paid for the song, or paid for public broadcast. I don&rsquo;t think the issue was whether the campaigns had the right to buy the song, if it was for public sale.</p>
<p>James P., I don&rsquo;t see how selling a software license gives you more right to restrict than if it&rsquo;s another kind of good. We are not talking about a personal contract, but something for sale publicly, and in your case through third parties. It may be that James M.&rsquo;s work has a different status because only he sells it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to my question, but your two responses I don&rsquo;t think resolve it.</p>
<p>Edit: Doing a little internet searching, I found that discrimination on the basis of religion, which James P. wants to do, in the US is prohibited in the case of housing, but maybe not in some other areas.</p>
<p>I ran across this book [[http://www.amazon.com/Right-Discriminate-Scouts-America-Association/dp/030012127X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266418259&amp;sr=8-1|A Right to Discriminate?]] which discusses the case in which the Supreme Court of the US permitted the Boy Scouts, a private organization, to discriminate against those who are homosexual.</p>
<p>That case would seem to support your right to discriminate, at least if you only sell the software yourself. If it&rsquo;s a public shop, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I hope that the recent source of your &ldquo;right&rdquo; to discriminate against those whose religious beliefs you find objectionable gives you pause.</p>

<p>No, that&rsquo;s a matter of an individual contract for services. Whom you decide to contract with personally for your services is your business. It becomes different when you are selling something retail. There you are saying: &ldquo;I will sell to anyone, except those with these religious beliefs.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where it becomes a problem, at least in my eyes.</p>
<p>Chris, that&rsquo;s a case where the business is affected by the decision to serve or not, like the bartender&rsquo;s right to deny a drunk customer another drink. Discrimination against individuals on the basis of their religious identity is different. That&rsquo;s discrimination purely on the basis of belief, not action, and that&rsquo;s problematic.</p>

<p>But that is <em>not</em> what I am saying. People with religious beliefs are welcome to license my fonts—they just need to buy a special license to use the fonts in religious or political materials. And I reserve the right to refuse to sell them a license for particular materials—not on the basis of the potential licensee being a religious person, but because I do not want my work associated with a particularly offensive works. I’m not telling people they can’t sit down at my lunch counter and eat a sandwich—just that if they plan to do so, they have to take off their hats and act civilized.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got a point that there&rsquo;s a difference, but it still seems to me that this is problematic discrimination. You said that the reason for the clause is so you can refuse to give a license to print anything by Mormons. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in the position of deciding what is permissible and impermissible speech. I admit I&rsquo;ll be upset if the Klan uses Williams Caslon, but if hundreds of thousands of other people are using it as well, I&rsquo;ll let it pass :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill, what if their religion prohibits bathing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The general guideline is that freedom of opinion should be absolute. Actions are a different matter. Thus if the burka interferes with public safety in Europe or the US, the government has the right to prohibit it. So for your case of the stinking massage client, the therapist can exclude them for stinking, not for their beliefs.</p>
<p>By the way, in Mali the Dogon people believe that washing takes away magic, and the chief of the Dogon is said to have a trained snake to lick him clean every month—possibly the coolest thing ever.</p>

<p>No I did not. I said that actions taken by Mormons led me to write a clause that allows me to “…refuse to sell license to really flagrant arseholes.” Do I really need to add qualifiers to make it clear that I am not lumping all Mormons into that category? And as I noted above the whole point of having a special license option rather than just prohibiting religious and political use is to allow me to sell the fonts for the majority of uses that are benign.</p>
<p>I am also not determining what is permissible and impermissible speech. I’m not stopping anyone from speaking out. I’m just reserving the option of not involving myself in speech that I do not want to be a part of.</p>

<p>Bill, that is my point. If a Massage therapist refuses service for stinking, the unserved (and unwashed) can still sue and say the person was cloaking their refusal to serve them to avoid prosecution. You never know what a jury might decide. I agree that people should be able to refuse service on grounds of health, safety, and hygiene issues but fear our litigious society might overact on the side of religion.</p>

<p>I really sympathize with your desire not to be associated with stuff that is odious.</p>
<p>But is it appropriate for a type designer to refuse to have his letters used to say something he finds repugnant?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; arguments generally, but I really don&rsquo;t see here how to draw a line well, except to publicly renounce an organization that you find odious, and ask them not to use your type.</p>
<p>I guess I just don&rsquo;t see law as the best option here.</p>

<p>I think I agree. Plus, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Working on custom projects for clients potentially puts a designer in a good position to be picky about who to work for, and what to make – with the latter, especially so when it&rsquo;s about making <em>finished products,</em> not <em>tools</em>. But fonts released for retail…</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying in vain to find a quote again that I read on some tech blog recently, a slightly more eloquent version of this obvious truth: It&rsquo;s impossible to design technology that only does good things. Tools can be used for good and evil (or whatever the tool&rsquo;s designer <em>thinks of as</em> good or evil). Fuel can be used to drive a car or a tank. Paper can hold a love letter or a declaration of war. And so can fonts.</p>
<p>I think trying to fight that fact or to control it is an illusion, if perhaps a comfortable/reassuring one.</p>
