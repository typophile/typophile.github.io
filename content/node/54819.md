body: "I always thought that glyph shapes were hard-coded in a PDF, if the respective
  font is embedded, so that a PDF file would look the same on all devices and systems.\r\n\r\nNow,
  I have converted some truetype fonts into pfb files, with WGL-4 encoding. On my
  Linux system, the german double s shows up correctly in a pdf I have produced with
  latex and dvipdfm (with option -e to disable partial font embedding, i.e. to embed
  all fonts completely). However, when displaying the file with both Acrobat and gsview
  on Windows, a ydieresis pops up where a germandbls should appear.\r\n\r\nDo PDF
  files look for any environment variables, fonts or encodings on the host system?
  The difference seems to be related to the operating system, as various PDF viewers
  show the /germandbls on the Linux system, and both Acrobat and gsview show the /ydieresis
  on Windows.\r\n\r\nWhere should I look first in order to fix this problem? Are you
  seeing a german double s or a ydieresis in the file? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  body: Found out what was going wrong. I embedded the fonts but did not call them
    with the correct font name. So they were defined with something like /Times-Bold
    but called with /Times. Then, as the viewer did not find the font in the file,
    it looked for it in the system, finding the font with slightly different encoding
    in Windows and Linux, respectively. Don't know if there is a PDF switch that strictly
    disallows the renderer to look for fonts on the system. Just embedding all fonts
    does not seem to guarantee that strange glyphs will not show up in the file. --

    I see on my Windows system. I work on Vista as host and Linux Ubuntu as guest
    on a Sun VirtualBox (great way to have 2 OS on one computer btw.). I assume that
    the PDF finds the Computer Modern Sans Serif (\"m n\" etc.) within the file and
    also take the Times New Roman from your system font directory. -- cs"
