  body: I&#39;m madly racking my brain trying to remember where I read about this.
    I keep thinking it was a German designer, maybe &#39;30s or &#39;40s. If I recall
    it I&#39;ll get back to you. And if it is indeed the same thing.

  body: The Dover book &#34;Art Deco Display Alphabets&#39; by Dan Solo shows a style
    called &#39;Blackline&#39; that is very similar to this. I will scan it and post
    it shortly.

  body: Here is Blackline. The A is different, but I think most of the rest looks
    the same. &#40;BTW, isn&#39;t &#39;Bifur&#39; a revival of Matra?&#41; <BR><img

  body: I&#39;m sorry, Bert, but Matra does look a lot like Bifur to me. If you substitute
    the red fill-in for P22&#39;s Bifur, don&#39;t you think there is a lot of similarity?
    <BR> <BR>&#40;I was not saying that I though Matra was the answer to the original

    a lowercase and allows two coloured layered setting. <BR> <BR>Previous digitizations

  body: yes Mike, Matra shares the same drawing style as does the Bifur, only the
    name changes, but the original drawn by cassandre is named Bifur <BR> <BR><a href="http://rmouron.club.fr/index7VA.html"
