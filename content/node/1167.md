    this sample! You&#39;re reopening the case of  <BR>a slew of unresolved IDs in
    an effort to get them IDed  <BR>eventually! Am I right?

  body: I&#39;m sure you can find a similar style in font form, but those <BR>&#39;C&#39;s
    and &#39;s&#39;s are too different for me to believe this sample <BR>was from
    a font.

    if you have any candidates to suggest. <BR> <BR>Posting old IDs? A good idea,
    but Yves, I think you might be delirious. Or much like the leopard, who, upon

  body: 'URW&#39;s version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/art-gothic/urw-t-normal/charmap.html"
    target=_top>Art Gothic</a> contains several alternate characters that better match
    your sample Jared. <BR> <BR>Precision Type has a version. Versions/clones from
    defunct foundries are out there as well. <BR> <BR>Art Gothic appears in the Victorian
    section of the Solotype Catalog. <BR> <BR>Stephen, I&#39;m sure that you are correct,
    but I&#39;m left wondering about a few things then: <BR> <BR><blockquote>1. Did
    metal type not contain alternate characters in a set? I know nothing about this,
    but noted that just the small sampling of Art Gothic in the Solotype Catalog contains
    two very different &#39;e&#39;s.</blockquote> <BR><blockquote>2. Could printing
    methods account for some of those variations, especially varying stroke weights?</blockquote>
    <BR><blockquote>3. When we see old type samplings &#40;like Jared&#39;s apparently&#41;
    that seem to mimic very old tyepfaces .... I don&#39;t know ... I guess this isn&#39;t
    a question. I&#39;m just trying to picture what actually was being done. A lettering
    artist sitting and copying a printed sample next to him/her? With those handwritten
    variations we note '

  body: 'Mike - A partial answer for you: before 1960 &#40;or so&#41; it was  <BR>common
    to see display lettering done by hand, simply  <BR>because in many instances it
    was cheaper and quicker to  <BR>pay an artist to draw the letters than it was
    to procure  <BR>metal or wood type to print them. How times have changed! <BR>
    <BR>The glyphs I refer to when I see signs of hand-lettering are <BR>the UC &#39;C&#39;s
    and the lc &#39;s&#39;s. But now I&#39;m coming to the <BR>realization that these
    samples are just too poor to get an <BR>accurate reading on their method of printing.
    It&#39;s just as <BR>likely, as others have said, that this comes from a metal  <BR>press
    with slight inconsistencies from ink and impression. <BR>The images are also poor
    scans, or photos, or whatever <BR>they are. It would help us all in this endeavor
    if we had <BR>more information about where the samples came from.'

  body: Don&#39;t forget film type, Mike. Metal isn&#39;t the only other printing
    method for type. I think most of the stuff in the Solotype Catalog is film type,
    because of the manipulations that were shown in the back of the book. Many of
    those tricks are done using film. Between the late &#39;50&#39;s&#40;?&#41; and
    early &#39;90&#39;s I think film type was used for a great deal of display and
    general typesetting, until digital type began to become widespread.

    online, I clearly had made some false assumptions and linked bits of info incorrectly.
    <BR> <BR>Your explanation of photolettering makes some of the comments in the
    Solotype Catalog, especially about tweaking jobs optically, make more sense now.
    <BR> <BR>Again, I&#39;m going to see what the library has to offer. Images of
    equipment and technique would be informative and fun for me to see. <BR><br>
