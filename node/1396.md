  body: ' Hey -- that&#39;s pretty cool. I&#39;m glad you and Joe were able to get
    it posted for us to see. &#40;I still haven&#39;t braved posting a Flash file,
    so my hat&#39;s off to you.&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>The name definitely makes sense now. It&#39;s kind of fun
    to watch, too -- with a sort of &#34;fritzing-out neon&#34; feel to the sparking
    pixels. <BR> <BR>If, as Joe asked, this is an original outline as well, I certainly
    think you should complete the static version of it as well as the animated version.
    <BR> <BR>Would it be possible to see a full character set any time soon? <BR>

  body: ' Synapse 1.0 : a brief description <BR> <BR>The origins of creating type
    has traditionally been predicated by a reader engaging type as a static experience.
    With the relatively new accessibility of interactive media, I believe it is time
    for both typographer and reader to re-examine how type is created and engaged.
    Typography can no longer be viewed as a static event, bound by the pages of a
    book. Each letterform now has the potential to be an event within itself. A universe
    of activity could reside in the single letter &#34;a&#34;. <BR> <BR>Synapse 1.0
    is an experiment in time-based typography. It is a hybrid of the biological and
    the technological - an organism of undulating modules. Shapes rhythmically coalesce
    into familiar and abstracted letterforms. Beyond a statistical improbability,
    a reader will never experience the same letter &#34;a&#34; twice. <BR> <BR>Synapse
    1.0 is an entirely original design inspired by various sources including Herbert
    Bayer&#39;s type designs, bitmap typography, and the destination signage on San
    Francisco&#39;s public transportation trains. I hope this typeface inspires conversation
    and debate. All comments are welcomed. <BR> <BR>The entire set for Synapse 1.0
    is nearly complete. Uppercase, lowercase and numbering are ready for critique.
    These will be posted in the near future. Finally, I would like to thank Joe Pemberton
    for his assistance in posting this file.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>-RM '

  body: You sure do like hyping yourself up. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be interested in seeing
    the ActionScript behind this animation. Are you simply triggering movie clips
    randomly to flash the segments of the fonts, or is there method behind the sequencing?
    <BR> <BR>Being as it is called synaptic, I&#39;d like to see a variant where the
    fluctuations are nerve-like responses to stimuli. <BR> <BR>Another avenue of exploration
    would be to really change the structure of the letters. Instead of just alpha-ing
    out segments of your letterform, what about designing a series of letterforms
    and utilising alternative segments to construct letters which are truly original
    each time. Even going so far as to breakdown each letter into a series of components
    - ascenders, descenders etc -and then construct each letter from random selections
    of each required component &#40;This WOULD get messy, but hey, you wanted abstract&#41;.
    <BR>Even calling upon the powers of Flashes drawing API to draw completely original
    shapes for each component every time - randomised within constraints. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    just not sure at the moment that your really breaking new ground here yet. For
    &#39;time-based typography&#39; we could just as easily read &#39;animated logo&#39;.
