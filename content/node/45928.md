  body: "I disagree about the Tiffany Heavy ID, because I think the C is wrong for
    one thing. I think it looks like a heavy weight of some Caslon, but these look
    like old newspapers, and so there may not be digital equivalents.\r\n\r\nThe second
    sample looks like artist hand lettering for a Camel ad from the days when that
    was the way such ads were done.\r\n\r\nThe \"College' lettering has an Art Deco
    look, but I couldn't find any American metal type that matched it. I couldn't
    find it in the Solotype Catalog either. Then I thought to see if Nick Curtis had
    revived anything like it. The closest I could find was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/rockin-roman-nf/|Rockin
    Roman]] taken from an old pen & brush lettering book.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Camels is a beautiful bit of what I'd call cartoon casual. I'm sure House
    Industries do something similar in their sign painter collection.\r\n\r\nCollege
    was probably also hand lettering although it is slightly difficult to analyse
    it at this angle.\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, College is definitely an American 20'ies, 30'ies type.\r\n\r\nAlso
    the low middle bar of the 'E' in the Camel ad might point towards the first half
    of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the Contraception article is from the
    same newspaper, only the fonts are of that age, I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"
