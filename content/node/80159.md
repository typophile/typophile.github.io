body: "Leibix, inspired by a jolly trademark of the past, is a fun family of five
  typefaces which transcends different eras of the past.  It has elements of the 1920s
  in its design, but is equally at home with projects having a 1970s theme of an up
  to the minute modern one.  Leibix is intended for eye catching cartoon captions,
  in posters of anywhere else a casual impact is required.\r\n\r\nGreater Albion is
  offering Leibix at an introductory 40% discount on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/leibix/
  | Myfonts]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Leibix--1_6607.png]"
