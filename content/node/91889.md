body: I'm doing a publication set in Omnes and I have my typographer's quotes in preferences
  on, but I keep getting inch marks even when I go through insert special characters!
  Does Omnes just not have typographer's quotes? If so do I leave it or fake it with
  a different typeface's typographers quotes? Thanks for your help!

  body: "In typography, what\u2019s correct is generally considered to be ancient
    practice.\r\nFor quotes, that means a relationship with the comma, which did double
    duty in foundry type, becoming a left quote simply by rotating 180\u02DA.\r\nIt
    also implies a relationship with the pen, so that in oldstyles, made with the
    broad pen, the comma/quote mark is more of a simple slash (see Palatino), without
    the blob and curl that are much more easily made with a pointed steel nib.\r\nIn
    a \u201Cround-nib\u201D sans, such as Omnes, there\u2019s not much precedent (a
    mix of geo and grot in the basic letter forms reinforces that idea), so the quote
    could go any way that a \u201CSpeedball\u201D nib could make it, with or without
    blob, with or without curve. Joshua Darden made the call. But he took it a step
    beyond merely mimicking a pen stroke, and, as in Optima, executed a \u201Ctapered
    slash\u201D, introducing a level of detail\u2014typographic\u2014beyond that of
    a the basic pen round-pen ductus that may be assumed to ground the style. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?T9\r\n\r\nBelow
    is an interesting example of how things originate; it\u2019s a specimen of one
    of the earliest sans faces, from the 1830s. The designer was experimenting with
    different forms of the comma (and hence quote mark) at different sizes. The smaller
    comma, with the fine stroke that\u2019s at a smaller scale than any other detail
    of the type, has become established as the standard grot comma. And I think it\u2019s
    this idea that one also sees in types such as Optima and Omnes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Figgins_5420.jpg]"

  body: Just a general, perhaps idle, question... For fonts which would be considered
    for straight-ahead technical or academic writing (sans or serif), is there a place
    for a less curly quote? This would be between the slanted slash and the traditional
    typographer's quotes, maybe a slash with a bend in it.
