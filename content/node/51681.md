body: "I'm looking for a typeface that is easy to read on screen at small sizes (11-14px
  high). It will be reversed on a colored button and dark gray on a white button.
  I'm currently considering Whitney Bold, but don't want to drop the cash if it's
  not going to work at these sizes. Does anyone have a copy of this typeface that
  would be willing to do a test for me? I need a few representative words typeset
  in uppercase at 11, 12, 13 and 14 pixels high. Black on white is fine. Ideally the
  words would be things like \"SAVE\", \"EDIT\", \"CANCEL\" \"ADD\". I'd really appreciate
  any help you can give.\r\n\r\nFeel free to make suggestions for alternate fonts
  as well. My primary requirement is that it be a stylistically neutral sans serif
  that's readable at small sizes. Here's an example of the button set in Kievit Bold.
  Thanks!"

  body: "Timothy: Kievit looks fine indeed. so does Freight Sans, and Whitney would
    work just as well. \r\n\r\nto my eyes, what sets Stephens samples apart from yours
    is not the font choice but the generous tracking. small-size/all-caps is sooo
    much easier to read with that extra bit of air in there."

  body: Agreed... My text is a bit tight. I'll be sure not to repeat that with these
    new buttons. Thanks!

  body: "\"Agreed... My text is a bit tight.\"\r\n\r\nYou are outlining the text,
    which besides confusing the reader at small sizes, has a tendency to make things
    tighter, as the outline is additional to the glyphs contour, and not internal
    to it, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "I don't have Whitney, but there is evidence that it's great at text sizes
    onscreen. Its judiciously non-orthogonal terminals might be the secret. Plus you'll
    end up using it to great effect in other ways too, so I would go for it.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're going to use only certain point sizes, another way you can go is a pixelfont
    - some of them even use anti-aliasing. For example for 13 point you might use
    Mana-13 Bold (the light-on-dark cut) which you can see here: http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I do have Whitney, and while it does look good onscreen at text sizes, the
    difference between the it an Kievit will be negligible. What really makes Whitney
    stand out are the self-indulgent subtleties, and they get lost rendered onscreen.
    Here it is at 14 points in FEX:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whit_3569.png]"
