  if anyone would share what the font for the above image might be! It's quite similar
  to ITC Bauhaus, but I guess it may be a custom one. I'm not too experienced with
  typography, so I'd welcome any feedback/thoughts. Thanks!"

    cuts and strokes) or a badly drawn freebie. Whatever it was, it is as you said
    deeply rooted in Bauhaus. '

  body: "Was just a personal point of view. Unbalanced drawing and inconsistency are
    clearly not of my taste. I don't like the way /e is drawn, it feels awkward as
    the entire logo. Don't like the connections between letters, not enough smooth.
    Don't like the stroke thickness inconsistency too. Don't even know how to read
    it... \"eden\" (in this case, what a bad /n to me)? \"edeo\"? \"edes\"? Looks
    like the designer had the idea \"4 circles\", started with the /d, added the /e's
    and even with difficulties sticked with it and just throw down the last letter.
    If it was a font, it's not as easy as reducing tracking between letters to create
    a connected lettering.\r\nTo me, it's another example of (may be)\"nice idea wrong
    execution\"."
