body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am currently in a job which is primarily a PA for a finance
  company. However I have taken on a new role of redesigning Powerpoint tutorials
  which are converted into online tutorials.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any good links
  about designing in Powerpoint or online tutorials. I would like to avoid the usual
  cheesy clip art and hope to redesign these learning materials in an attractive and
  modern way. "

  body: "I took a technical writing course this winter, and there was a section on
    PowerPoint presentations. Try to keep the text concise - maximum 6 lines per slide,
    6 words per line. Colours should be high-contrast, and the text should be in a
    font that is readable on-screen. Graphics should be relevant to the text.\r\n\r\nAs
    for avoiding cheesy clip art, avoid cheesy clip art.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    in Indesign. Powerpoint is just too focused on letting non-designers create presentations
    in a hurry; someone designing presentations full-time can (and should) do better
    to eschew it altogether. '
