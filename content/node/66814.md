    are going to need some context.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of riding are you going to do:
    Trail or Arena? Western, Hunter, Dressage? How often are you going to ride? Do
    you have your own tack already? If so, what kind? How much acreage do you have,
    or are you going to be boarding this horse elsewhere? Is anyone else going to
    be riding this horse also?\r\n\r\nAnd do you need that translated into Japanese?
    ;-)"
