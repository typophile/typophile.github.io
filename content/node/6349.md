  body: Well, if you were going to be at the ATypI conference in Prague this fall,
    I&#39;d suggest you come to my talk, &#34;Requiem for a font format.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>For my first Master&#39;s degree, I did my thesis in the area of MM technology,
    so I&#39;m certainly a fan. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll poke at a couple of angles of it,
    though.  <BR> <BR>The quote from Felici is misleading at best. &#40;Despite the
    book having been published under the Adobe Press label, nobody in the Adobe type
    group got to review it before it was published.&#41; <BR> <BR>- MM fonts are expensive
    to design in the absolute. But they are cheaper and easier to design than correspondingly
    large families of standalone fonts. To this day, Adobe does most of its new font
    development using MM design space; it&#39;s just that we generate standalone fonts
    instead of MMs in the end. <BR> <BR>- Many of our best-selling fonts were MM fonts.
    When both MM versions and non-MM versions were available, the MMs sold as well
    or better than the &#34;unimaster&#34; fonts. <BR> <BR>However, it is true that
    most users didn&#39;t use or care about the MM capabilities. It was the designs
    they liked, not the MM functionality. <BR> <BR>When you say &#34;we&#34; in &#34;why
    do we need MM fonts?&#34; it is not clear whether you mean end users or type designers,
    or some other group. <BR> <BR>Type designers need MMs or some other axis-based
    technology because it simplifies their work in developing large type families.
    <BR> <BR>Those end users who really &#34;dug&#34; the technology liked it because
    they could use the axes to generate their own custom instances, picking the exact
    parameters that fit their particular task needs. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I really miss Multiple Master fonts. I have a 3-5 year project that was started
    on Myriad MM and has migrated to MyriadPro. The idea was brilliant and the execution
    was impeccable. C&#39;est la vie. I also miss ATM Deluxe

  body: Paul,  <BR> <BR>you can always buy the Myriad Pro packages from Adobe, buy
    FontLab 4.6, and make a Myriad Pro MM yourself <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
