  John Cage album cover bi-lingual.\r\nI have chosen to use both english and japonese\r\ncharacters
  for obvious reasons. But here is my\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWorking in AdobeIndesign,
  how do you set alternative\r\nlanguages that are not native to your computer or\r\nsoftware.
  I am experimenting as a novice design\r\nstudent and I'm composing this as a portfolio
  piece.\r\n\r\nAlso, anyone who has this kind of knowledge of type-\r\nsetting in
  multiple languages would you have any \r\nsuggestions on what japonese typefaces
  pair well\r\nwith Frutiger's Univers?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n`j e a  n\r\n\r\n"

    to set the type manually.\r\n\r\nChoose Type > Glyphs\r\n\r\nScroll towards the
    bottom to see the Nihongo type choices. \r\n\r\nHope this helps. "

  body: also, if you're mentioning the word 'japonese' anywhere on the layout, be
    sure to change it to 'Japanese'
