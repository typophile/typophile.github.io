body: Some artwork for a 1/2 banner ad and 1/3 banner. How does this technique strike
  you? I like it in theory, but am not sure how it works with pixel fonts. <BR> <BR>Also,
  are the 1/3 banners too small to really pull off the attempt? <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/27055.gif"

  body: It took my a while to see the &#39;mean&#39;. I was staring for a while before
    I saw it. But that&#39;s just me. I prefer method &#39;A&#39;. <BR> <BR>At the
    size I&#39;m looking at now, the &#39;tangerine&#39; seems too hard to read on
    the 1/3 banners.

  body: I didn&#39;t see the mean at first, either. And I kept wondering what the
    split represented through the a and r &#40;almost a swastika&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I
    like the idea though. It reminds me of my aunts&#39; house. She had the word Jesus
    knitted on a rectangle on top of her TV. <BR> <BR>I think the 1/3 sizes work better
    in helping to see the whole picture. Perhaps, the larger size should have larger
    counters and apertures.

  body: thanks for your input guys. while i agree that a visual puzzle is sometimes
    rewarding, i&#39;m not so sure it works for web banners, where the average attentions
    span might be .0001 seconds. <BR> <BR>teeshirts, however, might be a different
    story.
