body: "This typeface been used by the Independent Truck Company since at least 1978.\r\n\r\nI
  always figured it was hand-done because I had only seen it used in their logo, but
  I've been seeing it recently in a lot of their packaging, DVDs, etc, leading me
  to believe it\u2019s a proper typeface.\r\n\r\nI've only seen it used in all-caps.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Indy_3824.jpeg]"
