  for 2 weeks and already there are hundreds of entries. Mostly I'm impressed, not
  just by the quantity, but with the quality and the direction it's moving. Looks
  like the future is going to be open source.\r\n\r\nSome exemplary posts so far:\r\n\r\n[[Garamond]]\r\n[[Bembo]]\r\n[[Baskerville]]\r\n[[Blackletter]]\r\n[[Futura]]\r\n[[X-height]]\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward to seeing this thing grow."
