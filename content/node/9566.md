  I can&#39;t get to any of the &#34;C- &#34; characters. <BR> <BR>I have included
  a picture to show what I am trying to access. <BR> <BR>I am on a Mac in Quark. I&#39;ve
  tried Illustrator too. No go. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6658.gif"

  body: Well, it looks a lot like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves/roman/charmap.html">Mrs.
    Eaves</a>, but in terms of accessing the characters, I think you need to be on
    a Windows machine to take advantage of them. See <a href="http://typedriverssupport.adobe.com/adobeknowbase/root/public/tm2582.htm?DREID=8066">Adobe&#39;s
    note</a> on the subject.

    period, which I&#39;ve always thought quite classy.

  body: You are right on both accounts Dave. <BR> <BR>I guess my only option is to
    create a new font if I want these characters included in a design I am making
    uh? <BR> <BR>Seems silly. oh well. <BR> <BR>Thanks Dave. <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: Sean -- <BR> <BR>The only way to access these from the Mac is indeed to reconfigure
    the font and generate a custom version. Some licenses will allow you to make a
    derivative like this, others won&#39;t. Emigre&#39;s license does not allow for
    this without permission.  <BR> <BR>But in the case of Mrs Eaves, there&#39;s a
    <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMrsS.html" target="_blank">
    fraction font</a> that gives you access to the basic three fractions and a whole
    lot more. I don&#39;t think this is part of the basic package, but if you really
    want those fractions, you should consider licensing it. <BR> <BR>In general, though,
    if you create a custom configuration and place these characters in some of the
    lesser-used slots, be careful when generating your font to specify Macintosh encoding
    and not Adobe Standard or you may still not be able to get to your characters,
    since the Adobe Standard encoding substitutes several characters from the Symbol
    font.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen this cause untold confusion before. <BR> <BR>Let
    me know if you need more explanation. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: Ah! John you answered my next question. So I&#39;m silly eh?<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> What would happen if you typed the character in ID then
    copied and pasted to Quark? <BR> <BR>Kent- Mrs Eaves was just for my example.
    The question was pertaining to some cheesy font &#40;no not that one!&#41; that
    I am working on. Don&#39;t worry I am still focused. I would truly be silly if
    I was working on this kind thing on that other font yet. Thanks. <BR> <BR>-smc

    would happen when you paste into Quark? Honestly don&#39;t know, but I think it
    would disappear.'

  body: I suspect, the same as John, that the fraction would disappear when pasted
    from Indy to Quark, since Quark wouldn&#39;t interpret the Unicode character code.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, Matthew Carter has the fractions in accessible slots of Miller --
    onequarter is opt-w, onehalf is shift-opt-p, and threequarters is opt-v. In Whitman,
    I&#39;ve placed them slightly differently -- onequarter = opt-w, onehalf = opt-d,
    and threequarters = opt-j.  <BR> <BR>This kind of nonstandard encoding is frowned
    upon by many, as it will &#34;break&#34; your underlying text. But as fabulous
    as Indy is reported to be, until Quark supports OT/Unicode this sort of thing
    will likely continue. Many of my clients have too much invested in and are too
    dependent upon Quark workflows for there to be any significant change in the near
    future. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    Kent. That I can chew on. So is Whitman missing Sigma and Pi? <BR> <BR>-smc
