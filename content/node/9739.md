  a logo for my wife&#39;s new law firm and I wanted to know what are your thougths
  about it. <BR>The firm is young and it is form by three young lawyers who want a
  classic identity. So I decided to go with Trajan for this project. <BR> <BR>The
  options I&#39;ve explored are this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67266.gif"
  alt="Logo options"> <BR> <BR>1 - Names in Caps - Text Line in Small Caps. <BR>2
  - Names in Small Caps - Text Line in Caps. <BR>3 - Names in Caps - Text Line in
  Small Caps aligned right. <BR>4 - Names in Small Caps - Text Line in Small Caps
  centered with the &#34;&amp;&#34;. <BR> <BR>My first try with all the text in caps
  I think is good but after trying with small caps in some parts of the logo I&#39;m
  not so sure. <BR>So, what do you think about it? Any input and suggestions will
  be welcome. <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot. <BR> <BR>Germ'
