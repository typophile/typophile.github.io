body: "I\u2019m moving to Manhattan in a few weeks and will need to find work. Rather
  than just dive head-first into job searching I plan to go through temp agencies
  as they seem to be better at finding the print work that I\u2019m looking for (and
  temping gives me more time to work on fonts!). I will probably just transfer up
  to the New York office of the firm I work with here in DC, but I\u2019m curious,
  is there a killer New York temp firm that I might not know about?"
