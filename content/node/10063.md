body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I have been using Fontographer until switching to OSx recently,
  and find it very time consuming to learn Fontlab via the manual and keeping up with
  my type projects. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know any Fontlab training in London or would
  be prepared to give me some individual training sessions? <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>Nicole
