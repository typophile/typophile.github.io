body: I know I have see this font in the past but I can't find it now. I need the
  name. I'm having a hard time finding because it has characteristics of a modern
  sans serif but with serifs. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

  body: I would categorise it as a geometric glyphic sans (structure of a sans with
    tiny sharp serifs). But I wouldn't know if that category even exists.
