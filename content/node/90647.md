  \"AUDION\" - the closest I have found for this so far is copperplate.  However,
  it is just not quite there.\r\n\r\nSecond - something close for the deForest script.
  \ \r\n\r\nAnd Lastly the \"DeFOREST Radio Co.\" on bottom of package.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe image of the package is located at http://tubeslover.com/uploads/2/8/7/5/2875654/5402346.jpg?322
  \ If the upload does not work\r\n\r\nA little history on the package this is from
  1929\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nKeith"

  body: "Thanks However, as to the broadway condensed the Leg in the R is different.\r\n\r\nAs
    to the hensler and modesto.  These too are close however, the apex on the A is
    smaller and these two typefaces also put serifs near the bottom of the U.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your efforts though.  It is getting close.\r\n\r\nKeith"

  body: 'You need to remember that this was printed before digital fonts - I looked
    at the 1934 ATF catalog and the R is correct except for being a bit broader on
    the box - this could have been caused by printing or in how the layout was created.
    When a digital version of Broadway was made it also added some changes I am sure.
    That all being said I do not think you will find a perfect match in a font today
