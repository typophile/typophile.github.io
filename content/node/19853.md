  is what stands out the most? What are we looking at?\r\n\r\nMore covers can be seen
  at http://www.neo2.es/ but it should be from #49 and down (chose in the right side)\r\n\r\n"

    mix well but they look great here. The magazine looks like nothing I would read
    though.\r\n\r\n;-)\r\n\r\nMikey"

    at a <a href=\"http://universaleverything.com/press/13\">bigger image</a>, it's
    definitely a custom ITC Avant Garde Gothic."

  body: "AH.. It was Ronda, not Rhonda. \r\n\r\nBut that's not the font though. As
    you say the R is similar, but the P's are also rounded in Ronda, which they aren't
    in the sample, so it could be something customised (avant garde...) or something
    else?!"

  body: "I fixed my lousy spelling. The Q on one of the covers is flipped upside down.
    I don't think the R is customized. That leg of the R does not belong to Avant
    Garde.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    tell us for sure if the R is Ronda or a custom Avant Garde.\r\n\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nMikey"

    the Q is an interesting and fun trick to achieve some kind of semi-connected O.
    Nice one. :^)"

  body: "Definitely a customised ITC Avant Garde.\r\n\r\nThe guys from Ipsum Planet
    tend to design their own typefaces and then gradually give them away free randomly
    every few issues or so. I\u2019ve a about 20 (of varying low quality) at this
    stage \u2014 misspent wages from my free-and-easy magazine buying when I lived
    in Barcelona.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019ll give this one away too quickly
    though as they use it for their masthead etc."
