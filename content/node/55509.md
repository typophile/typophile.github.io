    tittle (the dot of the \"i\"/\"j\") you\r\ncould use black PVC for the emptiness.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "What a fun project.\r\nTittle: How about making use of the 3rd dimension
    \u2013 bending the pipe \"up\" to face the viewer,* so that the tittle ends up
    being the dark space inside the pipe? (Or maybe that's what Hrant meant.)\r\n(*
    Kinda like the ones <a href=\"http://www.ludbiz.com/uploads/080902/080905/_23003c55.jpg\">here</a>
    but of course upright.)"
