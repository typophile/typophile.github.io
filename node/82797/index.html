As for software, I've only used After Effects and a little Flash for KT style work, neither is low in cost — unless you're a student, in which case you can get really good discounts (80% savings in some cases).</div>

There's a big difference between "typography" (i.e., the design and composition of texts) and "kinetic typography," though I suppose you could argue kinetic typography is a subset of typography. The standard tool for kinetic typography is Adobe After Effects, which, as Stickly mentioned, isn't cheap. However, if you have access to a video camera, you could do it stop-motion style, which doesn't need to involve software at all. [[http://vimeo.com/6382511|This]], for instance, was created by traditional stop-motion, entirely without assistance from software.

If you are interested in typography in the traditional sense, you might want to read "Thinking With Type" by Ellen Lupton, which is a fun introduction to typography, or "The Elements of Typographic Style" by Robert Bringhurst, which is a more in-depth foray.

		<div class="commentbody">This website is not really for me- I am a painter wanting to gain a bit of understanding about fonts.  I did the "Font 101" already, which was interesting, but it is not immediately apparent what information is applicable to using fonts responsibly.

Specifically, I have had to make several paper products (programs and postcards) for an event I am planning.  I am a painter, but I want to take baby steps to understanding how to use multiple fonts in one item.  I have a fine arts degree, but I am no designer.  I will pick up recommended books, but does anyone else have advice for amateurs (who probably will not read a whole book).  Basic rules for responsible font usage?

Thank you for your time and brain.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Basic Rule #1:
It's very rare for "multiple fonts in one item" to result in anything respectable.  :-)

BTW, to me it sounds like you belong here just fine.

If you’re going to mix ten fonts onto one page design, at least ONE of them ought to be a paid one ;-)

good luck</div>
