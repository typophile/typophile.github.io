body: "Dear Denizens of Typophile,\r\n\r\nI recently upgraded my studio to the outstanding
  new ADOBE CREATIVE SUITE 3. At the end of the authentication and registration process
  I was presented with the opportunity to\_receive a complementary license for\_Thom
  Phinney's HYPATIA SANS. What a value! I am in the process of making typeface\_recommendations
  to a new German-language childrens magazine and I believe that this may be the perfect
  typographic solution for them. What a surprise bonus! This brings me to a theory:\r\n\r\nIs
  anyone else flummoxed by the SANS designation in the name HYPATIA SANS? Are we to
  be treated to a HYPATIA SERIF in the near future?\r\n\r\nI believe so. The evidence
  for my\_hypothesis is as follows:\r\n1. Many ascending strokes in HYPATIA SANS feature
  serifs. These serifs seem to be in odd positions unless you consider that HYPATIA
  SANS could have been created by selectively removing serifs from the HYPATIA SERIF
  forms.\r\n2. I have heard from very reliable sources that Thom is telling\_colleagues
  that he is \"still working on the family.\"\r\n3. It would be foolish to add a style
  designation to a typeface name unless more styles are to come.\r\n\r\nLet's cross
  our fingers! When will CREATIVE SUITE 4 be released? What do you think of my theory?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph
  T. Burke"

  body: Thomas can answer best, but I think I recall him mentioning the idea of having
    a serif version to do with it. But, first, we need Hypatia Sans Italics. :^)

  body: "From a marketing perspective, I should probably just let this thread simmer
    for a week or something. But I thought it would make more sense to just answer
    your questions.\r\n\r\n1) Nope. The typeface was designed with those things that
    I call \"vestigial serifs\" from the start. I never had any other kind of serif
    that I lopped off. They had pretty much that exact form from the start (though
    part-way through I made the serifs more prominent in the lightest weights and
    less so in the heaviest).\r\n\r\n2) \"Still working on the family\" means I still
    need to do the italics for Hypatia Sans! Currently expected \"later this year\"
    but not right away.\r\n\r\n3) I am certainly leaving the door open to making a
    more extended family, and you're right that I put the \"Sans\" in \"Hypatia Sans\"
    with that in mind. I am rolling some fairly specific ideas around in my head,
    but I haven't even prototyped any of them yet (and won't until the Sans italics
    are pretty well under way).\r\n\r\nThat last point being said, don't hold your
    breath waiting for another part of the Hypatia family (other than the italics
    for Hypatia Sans). I love type design, but product management for fonts & typography
    at Adobe is my \"real job\" and type design is something of a sideline - there's
    no way that I'd have a new family ready for CS4.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
