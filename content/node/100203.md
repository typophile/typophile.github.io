  thoughts? I'm thinking it may be easiest to just modify Dispatch."

    Dispatch violates its EULA. Frankly I'm personally not against that sort of thing,
    as long as: you make dead sure it doesn't leave your drive; if it does leak out,
    be prepared to face the consequences. Also, make sure you don't just do a mechanical
    narrowing - all kinds of things will go wrong.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the reply, hhp. \r\nCould you clarify a point? Even if I have
    purchased Dispatch I am still not able to modify it? Is that correct? Is that
    a common part of an EULA or is that specific to Dispatch? Thanks again"

  body: "The thing is, you don't actually <em>buy</em> a font (unless you commission
    a custom typeface) you merely license it, according to certain terms. See section
    3 here:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/help/singleuserlicense/\r\n\r\nThings used
    to be more lenient, but sadly no-mod clauses have become the norm now. I say sadly,
    because I believe it's disrespectful of the precedents any type design is inescapably
    based on.\r\n\r\nFYI, Adobe is one of the few foundries that still allows modification.
    If you're likely to want/need to modify a typeface, buy Adobe. Unless you're like
    me and you think it's worth taking a risk/responsibility anyway.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
