  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Doggy Overnight Bag is to be a small kit that&#39;s placed in hotel rooms that are pet friendly. It will contains things such as a dog blanket, food &amp; water dishes, dog treats and other such stuff. <BR> <BR>They were presented with three different concepts and this is what they&#39;re going with. I have some tweaks in mind, but overall I&#39;m pretty pleased with it. I would like help seeing the things I shouldn&#39;t be pleased with. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the mark and the type on the second version but the letter spacing needs work. I think you need to take some space between the o and first g out in doggy and please don&#39;t crash the y into the g. In Overnight the t is floating and you can crash the ni combination a bit more. In Bag make the B a combination tighter.  <BR>Question: could you have come up with a harder to space font? I remember this font from the 70s and it never set well. If you have time take a look at ITC Caslon 224 Extra Bold, it has character and the color of the letter spacing is much better and it has some of the feel you have here. <BR>Did you do a verion of the mark with a black lab and a outline moon? I haven&#39;t seen a black moon lately.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you much for the feedback. <BR> <BR>Daniel, &#40;I forgot to mention&#41; you&#39;ll have to excuse my spacing on this for now. I&#39;ve yet to purchase that font, so it&#39;s as spaced by myfonts.com. I do expect some difficulty in spacing it well, though. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t yet tried the outline moon with a black  dog, but I&#39;m trying it real soon like. Does anyone feel the black moon is a serious issue? I&#39;d like to know. <BR> <BR>Windsor is the name, Tiffany. I felt it was quite warm and even sleepy&#40;?&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks again</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;Be careful of choosing a font based on its name! <BR>Huh? I&#39;m guessing there is a correlation, but it&#39;s not obvious to me. Do tell. <BR> <BR>Hrant, for what reason does the size of the dog concern you? The illustration goes quite small with the dog still being discernable. I don&#39;t think he could sleep comfortably on that moon if he was very much bigger. I will try him as big as I can though &#40;the client also wanted to see this&#41; <BR> <BR>Ole, waggy-tailed g&#39;s? I don&#39;t believe I would know how to pull that off. What are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/brighton/bold/testdrive.html?s=Doggy&amp;p=60"> these g&#39;s</a> doing? I was looking at that font&#40;Brighton&#41;, but I don&#39;t think so. <BR> <BR>I like the sloped sides in Windsor but, maybe I&#39;ll have to reign them in some. <BR> <BR>Is there any reason why the stroke contrast differs between letters in this face. Compare the the capital and lowercase o&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your comments everybody.</div>

I do agree that it&#39;s a good value. I&#39;ll see. <BR> <BR>quick question: I&#39;ve had the inkling that an Italic would be less appropriate for this, as they are less &#34;at rest&#34;. What do you all think? <BR> <BR>&#62;There is not any weight that would be perfect <BR>I&#39;d love to know you&#39;re thoughts &#40;or see an example&#41; of a perfect weight for this. <BR> <BR>Johnathan, that&#39;s interesting, but I&#39;m guessing I don&#39;t have to worry about that too much.

		<div class="commentbody">Call me crazy, but I&#39;m pretty sure the moon&#39;s outline is a bit mis-shapen. Perhaps too many pen points are getting in the way of a smooth vector circlish shape? <BR> <BR>Also, I really like PJ&#39;s Retrofit suggestion, though it might be better if it were slightly rounded.</div>

Consider sliding Overnight and Bag to the left until Doggy comes to rest between the O and the g in Overnight &#40;you probably want to loose the dot on the i in this case&#41;. I think the overall result will be tighter. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy</div>
