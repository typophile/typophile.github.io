body: "I know this is a William Page typeface, but I'm trying to track down the whole
  alphabet.\r\n\r\nSo far, I know this much:\r\na) it exists in digital form, as a
  font called Psychedelic Smoke\r\nb) when I compare 'Psychedelic Smoke' (an early
  90s truetype version) to my references (taken from old newspapers), that font does
  not really come close to showing the intricacies of the font. \r\nc) the earliest
  use I can find in the small town paper I work at is 1965, but it seemed more popular
  (at least with the ad agencies) through the 70s.\r\n\r\nI want to know:\r\na) if
  anyone knows any more details\r\nb) the source used for 'Psychedelic Smoke,' the
  only original William Page example I can find is only one word, not the whole alphabet.\r\nc)
  where I might be able to find more information if no one here can help any further\r\n\r\nI
  expect:\r\na) few replies and little interest, but feel free to surprise me!\r\n\r\nLink
  to 'psychedelic smoke' http://www.searchfreefonts.com/fonts/p36.htm\r\nThere are
  some other versions here, but I believe 'smoke' to be the source for them, as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Photo-Lettering's Alphabet Thesaurus, Volume 3 (copyright 1960-1971), lists
    it as <strong>Baghdad Backslant</strong>, and lists it in their Art Nouveau section
    (p. 371). This listing doesn't show a complete alphabet, only the phrase "Skidding
    Along Rapidly into First Place?" You might check the Solotype catalog...

  body: "Awesome, thanks oldnick. Maybe I can get a little further with that extra
    info.\r\n\r\nI'll see what I can find in the Solotype Catalog if I can find a
    copy. It's funny to keep hearing new names for this typeface, because I've always
    known it as the THE-in-The-Doors-logo font."

  body: "Try Victor Moscoso by Keith Bates:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.k-type.com/fontvictor.html\r\n\r\nFrom
    his page:\r\nThe Victor Moscoso font is based on the 1960s psychedelic poster
    lettering of the artist Victor Moscoso. The letterforms are derived from some
    of his most celebrated Neon Rose posters of the late sixties, in particular the
    archetypical Moby Grape 'Neptune's Notion' of 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Solotype Catalog has a showing of Smoke, but only the phrase, \"TRAVELS
    with my aunt in\". While the showing is rather small, Psychadelic Smoke looks
    to be quite consistent with the letters shown. Far more than Victor Moscoso (check
    out Keith Bates' nifty Rick Griffin font set [Pay Fonts #17] for another 60's
    psychadelic poster font while on his website).\r\n\r\nI'm quite curious as to
    what those \"intracacies\" are that you mention, Kyle. Any chance of a showing?"

  body: "the victor moscoso has the same problems as the 'psychedelic smoke' font.
    For instance, the crossbar on the T is drawn with tiny loops on the ends, you
    can see a stroke on each side crossing back over the crossbar... see below.\r\n\r\nliquid
    night is a version of this typeface that I was working on prior to discovering
    better quality lettering samples.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/t-compare_4364.jpg]\r\n\r\nedit:
    upon closer inspection, Psychadelic smoke is definitely the better of all the
    available choices (so far). I may use it, and my original specimens to try and
    update this font."

    is more consistent with the original 'T' than your "original".

    catalog.\r\n\r\nI started on liquid night with just a few very small printed sources,
    mainly album covers, hence the lack of detail that Psychedelic Smoke at least
    attempts to show."

    it's only the angle of the letter that is closer, the outline seems to match more
    to my scan from the newspaper.\r\n\r\nhopefully I can afford a copy of that catalog,
    typography is an expensive hobby!"
