    </a> designed by Eric Gill in the 1930s.\r\nBut there differences in the serifs
    and the beak on C. Compare your image with:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PerpetuaRomanMT_5597.jpg]\r\nSo
    I wonder what font is closer?\r\nDon"

    my version is definitely different."

  body: "The Perpetua serifs are a conventional rendering of the old metal type.\r\nThe
    serifs in your image -- which have a sharp join to the stem rather than a smooth
    transition -- suggest a relatively recent redesign of Perpetua to give it additional
    crispness for display purposes.  I don't know if this is an actual new font, perhaps
    under a different name,  or a designer's word-smithing.\r\nDon"
