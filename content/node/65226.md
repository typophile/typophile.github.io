body: Can you tell me if you've ever come across a definite design rule, that states
  whether CAPITAL  letters are more legible from a distance as opposed to Upper and
  Lower Case letters used in conjunction with each other? A lot of the time I believe
  capital letters have been used with false understanding, just because they are all
  larger in height, yet they are all square in shape basically. I'm wondering, by
  contrast, if the diversity in shape of Upper and lower case letters produces more
  clarity?  Do you know if there has in fact been any studies done on this?  I hoping
  you can set me straight. I would like to offer my customers the best information
  I can muster so that I can effectively design their signage with better knowledge.
  I hope to hear your side of this, and perhaps you might even know of a 'source'
  of literature or web site to refer to on this question.

    best advice I can give is to look at what's used in your area for highway signage
    - then cite a study (a fictitious one works just as well as a real one) commissioned
    by the highway agency in researching the most legible solution. You could also
    quote the exorbitant cost of the study, the tab of which was picked up by the
    local tax-payers - ie. your customers. \r\n"

  body: How many books have you read set in all caps? Billboards are bigger, but they're
    also farther away. If that doesn't work, take Simon's advice and have them read

  body: "When designing signs I find that lateral space is usually at more of a premium
    than vertical space for text.\r\n \r\nAll-caps, at the same nominal size might
    well be more legible, but U/C characters are generally wider and, excepting ascenders,
    taller and therefore occupy more area per glyph. \r\n \r\nTry setting your text
    in upper and lower case, then all-caps at the same nominal size, then in upper
    and lower case, increasing the size until it is the same length as the upper case
    sample. Then walk away from your samples and see which one becomes unreadable
    first. \r\n\r\n\u2026\r\n-=\xAE=-\r\n\r\n"
