  the costs, the set up required, etc?\r\n\r\nI have some Zines I would like to produce
  more propperly.  The content is all vector and photo, but it would be awesome to
  print on nice paper and something be more propper than laser or photocopy.\r\n\r\nIs
  it possible to get 100 - 30 page booklets printed in black and white and maybe one
  spot color?\r\n"

  body: "The costs depend on the paper you choose and the printer (the company, not
    the machine). The best way to find out how much it's going to cost is to get several
    quotes from a bunch of local printers. \r\n\r\nAs far as setup goes, it really
    depends on how you want the final product laid out. In the old days, you often
    had to make various adjustments to the file to account for how the document was
    going to be printed and folded, but these days, every printer i work with takes
    my files, paginates everything (so that pages get printed on the back of the correct
    pages so that when you're reading through it, everything is in the right order),
    makes the plates right from my files (no more printing film then making plates
    from that) and prints it.\r\n\r\nYou _can_ print 100 copies of a 32 page booklet
    (the number of pages in your document has to be a multiple of four), but it's
    not going to be cost effective. That's a VERY small quantity, so all the various
    setup costs (printing plates, press setup, saddle stitch setup, etc.) will be
    spread out only 100 pieces, so your cost per piece will be very high. Even though
    it's only black and white, there's a still a lot of setup involved.\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to look into digital printing. The quality can be quite nice (and some
    digital printers even use ink, rather than toner), and for that quantity, it'll
    probably be more cost effective than offset.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is too small for even the short-run book printers to do offset. Print-on-demand
    technology only, which is   *not* offset. The images will be well-rendered, but
    the type won't be up to offset quality. You might find a small local print shop
    who'll do it, but the cost won't be attractive. Break even cost for offset is
    around 500 copies of a 100-pages."

  body: "Offset printing is much more expensive than digital printing or photocopying
    because maintenance of the press and setting up jobs is more complicated than
    it is with digital/photocopy. It\u2019s also best done in larger quantities\u2014at
    some shops the first 100 sheets through the press are just checked for problems
    before they go in the trash and adjustments are made. The big advantage is that
    the print quality is sometimes better than digital, special inks and coatings
    can be used, and one gets more paper choices. You can also use really cheap paper
    with offset printing to save money.\r\n\r\nThere are now a lot of small printers
    who specialize in simple offset jobs at low prices. Take a look at http://www.printplace.com/
    for your zine. "

  body: "I just wanted to clarify James' comment. For *low* runs offset printing is
    much more expensive. For a run of, say 500 copies of a small brochure, most of
    the cost is the setup of the press and in many cases, for large jobs, 100 sheets
    is a low estimate of how much paper is run through as \"make ready.\"\r\n\r\nOnce
    everything is setup however, the only additional costs are paper (relatively cheap)
    and pressman's time. That's why there are usually huge price breaks as you increase
    quantity. It might cost $1000 to print 500 brochures, $1500 to print 1000, $2500
    to print 5000... you get the idea.\r\n\r\nDigital printing is super convenient
    for low runs, but there don't tend to be significant price breaks. It may be $25
    per booklet whether you print 5 or 50 or 500.\r\n\r\nWe use both offset and digital
    printing a lot and anytime you have a run of something between 300 - 500 it's
    an awkward middle ground where it's going to be too small for offset, but expensive
    for digital. "

  body: "I'd disagree with Charles_e a bit on type quality for digital short-run printing.
    True, some of it looks as though the type had been carved into a slab of potato
    and inked with a rubber stamp. But there are quite a few shops who can do really
    good type.\r\n\r\nI think it is the images that suffer most in digital, at least
    halftones. But even those differences are disappearing.\r\n\r\ncheck these: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bookmobile.com/\r\nhttp://www.integratedbook.com/index1.html\r\n\r\nGet
    a sample, or have them do a test from your files. You'll be surprised.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "If you want to offset a zine why not? It would be a good way to learn the
    process. Everyone is right, it won't be cheap but you can always try to make things
    more economical. If you want to use black plus one colour, plan your 32 pages
    with the imposition (the arrangement of the pages prior to folding) in mind. If
    you plan correctly you can produce a a two colour document on two plates.\r\n\r\nIt
    sounds fun and the whole process is really rewarding."
