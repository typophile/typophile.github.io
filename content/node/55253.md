  that do not display as one font, in programs such as Illustrator. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\nPolitica\r\nPolitica
  Italic\r\nPolitica Bold\r\nPolitica Light \r\nPolitica Light Italic\r\nand so on..
  \ instead of just displaying Politica.\r\n\r\nThis very much clutters the font menu
  and makes it quite a hassle to find a certain font.\r\nDoes anyone have a solution
  to this problem or shares it?\r\n\r\nAny input is very much welcome.\r\n\r\nPeace,"

  body: I don't use Illustrator, but if it is like other Adobe apps the font menu
    supports the OpenType preferred name fields in the font name table (presuming
    we're talking about TTF or OTF fonts). Your list suggests that the fonts are misnamed
    even for simple style-linked families.

    anyone have this problem or am I the only one?"

  body: "If you are getting even italic and bold fonts appearing as separate entries
    in the font menu, then what I said is correct: the fonts are misnamed even for
    simple style-linked families. If they were correctly names, then you would see
    something like\r\n\r\nPolitica\r\nPolitica Light\r\n\r\nA style-linked family
    consists of up 4 fonts including regular, italic, bold and bold italic, which
    should appear in the font menu under a single name.\r\n\r\nIn Adobe apps, there
    is a font menu and a style menu, and what you see in each depends on the format
    of font used and how the name table entries are made in the font.\r\n\r\nIt would
    be helpful to know what format these fonts are (PS Type 1? OTF? TTF?) and if you
    can post a screenshot showing what you see in the Illustrator menus that would
    also be helpful.\r\n\r\n"
