body: I've got this old letterpress cut with four characters on it. I haven't been
  able to identify the typeface or find and identical font (I've found plenty that
  are similar, but clearly not the same). Does anyone recognize what this actually
  is? Thanks for any help.

    sample? The showings of Venus that I have found do not seem to have as large a
    counter as this sample, but I could not see yours very well. The Venus Extra Bold
    showing in the Phil's Photo book (1985) is not nearly as heavy as this sample
    either, but that is film type.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    of this letterpress cut, but here's a photo of the original:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2267751472_d4784a21b5_4962.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

    night:\r\nIts not a a german clichee but from England or US.\r\nSo I do not think
    its Venus.\r\nAnd I'm not enough familiar with foreign lead fonts (from out of
    Germany) to say what it is. Sorry.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
