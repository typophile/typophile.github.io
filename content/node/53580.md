  love the cover of this book. The chalkboard and handwritten type brings me back
  to the good old days. I have yet to read this book, but from what I have heard the
  author and his works are pretty \"off-beat\" and this cover definitely gives that
  vibe. "

    designed this cover. Sedaris is very funny, by the way. His writing often appears
    in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>.
