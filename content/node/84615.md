  sample]]. This is a pair of serif and sans serif - or batang and dotum - (Called
  \uACE0\uC6B4\uD55C\uAE00 (Go-un Hangul) in Korean) designed by Ryu Yanghee. They
  have the most feminine aproach in all the Hangul typefaces.\r\n\r\nBut I have question:
  Where were the Latin and numeral portions of the fonts came from? I tried MyFonts'
  What the Font and several other font identifier sites, but couldn't find exact matches.
  Were those portions designed by Ms. Ryu herself? Or, were those came from existing
  typefaces not listed on those sites? (Like Panno and Gotham on MyFonts)"

    road sign typeface (or Panno), and also the typo-geek, should help.

    I think the best way is to ask the designer. In the pdf you see an e-mailaddress:
    rionss@chol.com\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: Yeah, serif looks more like Goudy, except that capital Q. Now, what about
    sans?

  body: "I e-mailed [[http://www.sandoll.co.kr/|Sandoll]], the distributor of Go-un
    fonts. And returned mail said that the Latin and numeral portions were made with
    references to [[Garamond]], [[Goudy]], [[Times]], etc. for batang/serif ones and
    [[Helvetica]], [[Fedra Sans]], Humania[sic, I guess?], etc. for dotum/sans ones.\r\n\r\nI
    don't want to close this thread just with this. So let me ask something. We learned
    the serif ones are close to [[Goudy Old Style]]. Then, which Latin sans serif
    font is close to Go-un Hangul Dotum's Latin and numeral portions? Helvetica is
    unlikely. I guess it's one of those two remaining humanist sans serif fonts, but
    the shape of glyphs is slightly different from that of Fedra Sans. (Especially
    capital M, etc) Any ideas?"

      for Gothic Neo1]] and [[http://neo.sandoll.co.kr/neo/mjneo1.asp|Lyon Text for
      Myeongjo Neo1]]. But I know, it's all bitter.
