  body: "Seems like a nice concept, overall... and a lot of work! Some things I noticed:\r\n\r\n-
    c and e could be more differentiated.\r\n- b and d could be unique designs as
    opposed to mirrored versions of each other; same with p and q.\r\n- r and m aren't
    doing it for me; I think they might look nicer with a stem on the left similar
    to what you have on n.\r\n\r\nOther than that I think it's very interesting. I
    like how you \"filled in\" all of the counters while maintaining its legibility.
    Will there be capitals?"

  body: "I'm considering adding numbers and maybe some puncuation but an upper case
    as well...that would be a whole other mountain, maybe in the future. \r\n\r\nI
    agree with all your feedback wongxiao, but the problem is besides the c and e,
    I don't really have an approach in mind for the b and d (maybe a just a slight
    variation might do it) or for the p and q either. \r\n\r\nI want this font to
    maintain a certain illustrated font look to it so I definitely want uniqueness
    to each letter, that is why I agree that the c,e,b,d,p, and q need to examined.
    However, I'm kind of weary to put a stem on the m and r cause it might begin to
    look formulaic with the letters.\r\n\r\nYou're right, this font has been alot
    of work, and working these last letters out is quite a challenge. Its like running
    a long marathon only to find a steep hill as you approach the finish. "

  body: The r is ambiguous. It could be mistaken for s or e in some contexts. This
    could be solved with a stem, but I think the real problem is the way you've curled
    the vertical under. I would redraw the r while looking at f as a positive example.

  body: "Made changes on many of the letters suggested. I'm still open critiques.
    I'm probably still going to touch up the r more since I pretty much borrowed it
    from the m. I changed the b and d, I borrowed the q from the b, which I don't
    mind cause the q is going to be minimally used, I might change a little on the
    inside though just to try give each character a unique touch.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snail-skin_4062.gif]"
