  body: Brian, I'm not sure that is entirely true. Unless I am used to some of manual
    of style. If an ellipsis falls in the middle of a sentence is should have a space
    on either side. If it falls at the end of a sentence it should have a space in
    front and behind followed by a full stop.

  body: "Brian, as far as I know, yes, if you have an ellipsis in the middle of a
    spanish sentence you have to pull a space before or after it. I don\xB4t know
    in other languages but I guess it must be the same.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "Not exactly, H\xE9ctor, considering the other languages.\r\nFor example,
    in Russian if the ellipsis is put in the middle of the sentence it is always followed
    by space, but never preceded. If a sentence is ended with an ellipsis, it is the
    last glyph in the sentence (no further stop). It can also start the sentence \u2014
    it this case the first character follows the ellipsis immediately and is lowercase."
