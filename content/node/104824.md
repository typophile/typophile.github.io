  french rural town museum.\r\nI suppose the text is composed with an 80's electronic
  typewriter.\r\nIf anyone have an idea about this typeface, machine model ... and
  if it's still digitalized, please let it know.\r\nThanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typewriter1_3614.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typewriter2_3450.png]"

    for typewriter type images to use in a fontmaking project. I regret that I am
    unable to identify your typewriter model.\r\nI can, however, inform you that the
    base font for it's capital letters is found on the \"element\" [the thing that
    looks like a golfball] for IBM typewriters bearing the font Orator, designed for
    IBM typewriters by John Scheppler in 1962. Digital version sold by Adobe, Linotype
    and Bitstream as <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/similar?TA\">Orator</a>.\r\nSome
    typewriter companies added a lower case to the Orator capitals.\r\nYour typewriter
    font is rather rare in that the lower case is sans serif letters rather than serifed.\r\nIt
    may be digitized, but I have not come across it.\r\nPerhaps one of our other typophiles
    has something for you.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "You're welcome.\r\nInformation on typewriter font styles was published annually
    in the NOMDA Blue Book, the \"blue book\",  as late as the 1970s, and perhaps
    the 1980s.  Separate sections or books for each manufacturer. Some parts have
    been scanned and are available on-line at: http://munk.org/typecast/?s=blue+book.\r\nIf
    you can find a typewriter repair shop -- I expect they are almost extinct -- they
    may have copies that you could consult.\r\nIf you wish to undertake further research
    into typewriters Munk's page has a good set of links to get you started on exploring
    the \"typosphere.\"\r\nGood luck and good hunting.\r\nDon"
