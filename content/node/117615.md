  requests, so I\u2019m really looking forward to your replies!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m currently
  working for a client and I am looking for a squarish typeface with rounded edges.
  So far I am rather pleased with typesupply's \xBBTorque\xAB http://vllg.com/typesupply/torque
  \u2013\_however it\u2019s lacking a semibold between medium and bold \u2013 the
  bold face is a little to heavy for this design that we're aiming for.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  having a hard time finding proper alternatives to torque, because it is very specific,
  so I was hoping maybe one of you folks knows a similar typeface?\r\n\r\nthank you
  in advance!"

  body: "Thanks so much for your first replies! This is for a whole corporate design,
    so it has to work as a logo font as well as headlines. :)\r\n\r\nI like Brooklyn
    and Blender a lot, but both have sharp corners. My aim was to find that squared-sans
    feeling with rounded corners, similar to Torque.\r\n\r\nIf you look closely, all
    those sharp little edges have been rounded off, which gives it a less aggressive
    feel."

    Alphaville? http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/alphaville/\r\n\r\nAnother option
    is to approach Village or Typesupply directly and ask them about the weight you
    are after. I've down that before and found foundries are usually quite helpful."
