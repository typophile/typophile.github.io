		<div class="commentbody">Uhm... Hrant, how would you define a RESULT in a creative experiment. Isn&#39;t part of the charme of an experiment that you don&#39;t know the results. Although it would be nice to have an ex-post-analysis of, say, the 80s/90s post-digital-typographic-experimentation, I don&#39;t think it should matter to those who DO the experiments what is the actual outcome of their work. I think in experimentating, the process, the finding-out-about-things or the plaing-around-without-things is very much in the foreground, it is very much an explorative, not a teleological animal. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here I go agreeing with Hrant again: a result I&#39;m not keen to analyse. <BR> <BR>Experimental is typically used, in reference to type design and typography, as a lazy term to <i>avoid analysis</i>. Unorthodox design is explained away as &#39;experimental&#39;, often as a means of ducking criticism of the results. There is a presupposition that all experiments are successful experiments, justified entirely by their experimental nature rather than by either their goals or their results. True experimental design follows an experimental path: hypothesis, procedure, analysis. <BR> <BR>If you want to see amazing experimental type design and typography, take a look at the work of the Didots and Bodoni.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If experiment were used simply in the sense of &#39;trial-and-error&#39; in regard to type design and typography, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much. But the term seems to have been fairly frequently used to elevate what was, in fact, stylistic play by suggesting a scientific rigour that it didn&#39;t possess. Lewis Blackwell&#39;s books about David Carson are prime examples. The same sort of thing happens when the jargon of critical theory -- itself an appropriation of scientific and pseudo-scientific terminology by way of social sciences -- is applied to graphic design: its main purpose seems to be to make designers feel important. <BR> <BR>We should never underestimate the vacuity of much of the design industry, and should be wary when it starts using impressive sounding words. Erik Spiekermann made this point at ATypI this year, relating how, having established a reputation as an information architect &#40;another appropriated term&#41;, he began to receive requests for him to give things &#39;that information design look&#39;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There&#39;s nothing scientific about Carson, of course. Erik, however, actually in many ways was bringing a certain clean-yet-lively architectural feeling to corporate design and there is indeed a very Spiekermannesque look, which for a long time permeated a lot of what he and Metadesign did. His typefaces are all infused with a certain common style and his graphic design also has certain elements and principles, like simple geometrical rectangle vanishing into the bleed, distinct typography, solid construction... and a sense of playfulness that keeps it from </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is a sense in which <i>all</i> serious type design is experimental: it proceeds from an idea, through a process of testing and refinement, and generally reaches a significant resolution if not conclusion. But something tells me that when Brandon asks for examples of &#39;experimental typography&#39; he is thinking of stuff that <i>looks</i> experimental, i.e. novel and unorthodox. One way to clarify this would be to ask what is counter to experimental typography: presumably that which is based on known results, i.e. prior experiment or discovery. Above, I mentioned the types and typography of the Didots and Bodoni as examples of experimental typography, and if we no longer think of a block of text on a relatively narrow width, with generous leading, set in a Didot or Bodoni type as &#39;experimental&#39; it is because we have analysed and understood the results of that experiment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have this thing called a Korg MS2000. It&#39;s a MIDI-controlled analog modeling synthesizer designed to make lots of obnoxious noises in rapid succession. I poke at it about once a month or so. I don&#39;t play it--I&#39;m not a musician--I just twiddle the knobs and approximate tunes, basslines, and something the kids today call &#34;grooves.&#34; Which is different than the Susan Sontag kind, I think. Anyway, I would have called the resulting recordings &#34;experimental music:&#34; a few years ago when I was more  overconfident. Now I just call it &#34;obnoxious music&#34; cos that&#39;s what it is. Except maybe for the &#34;music&#34; part. But it&#39;s fun to make! <BR> <BR>I couldn&#39;t agree more with Mr. Hudson about humanities and social sciences. These tedious, insufferable ho-dads presume to adopt this ersatz scientific-sounding jargon to inflate their worthless, totally subjective, self-involved yet publicly funded work in blatant service of this or that completely transparent agenda which they nonetheless deny without fail. <BR> <BR> For more on this I recommend the book <i><a href="http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/gposgsub.html#AAT">Fashionable Nonsense</a></i> by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont and anything by David Stove or Roger Kimball. <BR> <BR>But I confess I never thought twice about using the word &#34;experimental&#34; to describe type or typography, which now in hindsight seems a mistake. Thanks for the reminder. Then again I won&#39;t get too worked up over what&#39;s often just semantics. Or do I have the right definition of &#34;semantics?&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Hudson wrote <BR> <BR><i>The same sort of thing happens when the jargon of critical theory -- itself an appropriation of scientific and pseudo-scientific terminology by way of social sciences --</i> <BR> <BR>which is what I was referring to. And I wasn&#39;t paraphrasing what he said, merely taking it and running further. I think a lot of what is called &#34;social science&#34; today is the result of an almost scientific process built upon entirely unscientific grounds and therefore nonetheless ultimately worthless. I don&#39;t expect Mr. Hudson to agree with it entirely... who knows... he might. But I&#39;m sorry if you infer that I expect him to. <BR> <BR>Really, Sokal does a much better job of taking it apart. The main argument in this thread seems to be the abuse of the term &#34;experimental.&#34; <BR> <BR>In terms of type, I&#39;m definitely not a purist. I don&#39;t like anything that anyone called &#34;grunge&#34; but I have a weakness for silly decorative stuff. &#34;Over the top,&#34; you might call it. I still love a great text face, but I like florid baroque stuff as well, especially blackletter. There are a number of interesting &#34;experimental&#34; blackletters, probably the most famous of which was Unger Fraktur.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I say &#39;<i>a lot of what</i> is called &#34;social science&#34;&#39; I mainly mean parts of sociology and psychology. Geography et al I have no problem with. Sorry for the confusion there. I am talking about a small subsection of that body of knowledge that seems to expend a disproportionate amount of the available funding. I don&#39;t know how familiar you are with American academia over the past ten years, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, but in my view &#40;and for many others&#41; lots of scholarship in these otherwise worthwhile subjects has been wasted on things like identity politics. I ran into this issue in pursuing my own degree &#40;in German&#41; and ended up having to make a rather painful decision not to go to grad school.  <BR> <BR>Nothing personal, but I get really tired really quickly explaining the problem, because it&#39;s been covered so well elsewhere already, so please just consult the Sokal book I cited if you want to explore this more. Or read any copy of <i>The New Criterion</i>.</div>

I don&#39;t think it can be denied that the current trend in the USA is a reduction in the respect shown to the cultures of learning and knowledge, and a kind of distortion of democratic ideals wherein the populace are encouraged not to look up to and emulate educated people but to despise anyone who isn&#39;t just like themselves.</div>
