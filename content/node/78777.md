body: "I've been wondering lately about whether its ok to use capitalization on a
  typeface that is all caps already (i.e. Copperplate Gothic) I was pretty sure that
  it was something not to do but I see it everywhere (including the business I'm designing
  for) and it's making me think, is everyone setting it incorrectly?\r\n\r\nI prefer
  to not but I would like to back my decision with facts. Most of these all cap typefaces
  have an upper and lowercase but the strokes look thicker making me think it's incorrect.
  \r\n\r\nIs this just a preference or is there a typographic rule?\r\n\r\n- Matt"

  body: "If the typeface actually includes an uppercase and a \u201Clowercase\u201D
    (i. e., a smaller version of the uppercase, as in Copperplate Gothic), I don\u2019t
    see a problem. It is similar to setting a phrase in small caps with the initials
    capitalized: I don\u2019t like it so much either but it is fair game.\r\n\r\nSubtle
    differences in stroke thickness are always expected between uppercase and lowercase,
    because the uppercase needs to deal with a bigger amount of empty space. Probably
    it has more to do with the specific case of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/copperplate-gothic/|Copperplate
    Gothic:]] specially in lighter weights, the \u201Clowercase\u201D is certainly
    much more lighter than the uppercase and I would not use it because of that (a
    personal taste, not a typographic rule). But in bolder weights this difference
    is almost gone.\r\n\r\nNow, if the \u201Clowercase\u201D was done using false
    small caps, that is a different story, since difference in stroke thickness would
    be huge (\u224830%) and therefore not allowed. The funny thing with Copperplate
    Gothic is that the \u201Clowercase\u201D in lighter weights is so light when compared
    to the uppercase than it gives the impression of being false small caps\u2026"

  body: What do people think about using the mixed cases in Adobe Trajan? Is it considered
    tacky or OK? (Trajan now has smaller letters for lowercase). I'm using it for
    large titles on maps, etc.
