  these samples. The type in the photos is small, which makes it more difficult. It
  has some obvious similarities to Alternate Gothic, but I don't think that's it.
  Any ideas?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.lottanieminen.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lottanieminen_GD_kibook-07.jpg\"

  />\r\n\r\nSome more images (though some are small) are available here: http://www.lottanieminen.com/graphic-design/ki-kinnunen-book/\r\n\r\nShe
  says at the beginning of that post that this design was based off an earlier identity
  design, so I assume that this is the same face: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.lottanieminen.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/lottanieminen_GD_kikinnunen-02.jpg\"
  />\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering if the lowercase, less condensed face shown here is
  part of the same family or a different typeface altogether. So I guess I'm trying
  to find out what they both are. Any help would be great. Thanks a lot!"
