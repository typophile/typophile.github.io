body: "I'm finishing up filling out the Cyrillic codepage, but one thing that has
  been making me wonder is to what degree descenders should be homogenous.\r\n\r\nI
  know that \u0426 and \u0429 can receive swash descenders but otherwise and almost
  always have the same as \u0414.  But, there seems to be from what I can tell (both
  between wiki and the unicode charts and other fonts I've looked at) a random decision
  for other letters as to whether the \"descender\" is the sort of enlarged downward
  serif as in \u0414, this exact same shape but mirrored like \u04CB, angled more
  sharply and called a tail like \u04C9, a cedilla like in \u0498, an ogonek in \u04BE,
  or a vertical/pointed \u040F.\r\n\r\nDo \u0498 and \u04AA get cedillas because of
  the round shape?  What determines \"tail\" versus the \"spike\"?  And are there
  any other letters that are distinguished only by the form of their descender (I
  can only think of \u04A2 / \u04C9 and \u04B6 / \u04CB)"
