body: "Hi all just wondering if anyone know what this font is? \r\nMainly after the
  font that says \"Italian Championship\" I believe the font in the black rectangle
  at the bottoms is the same just not italic.\r\n\r\nIs kind of similar to Ray Larabie's
  Conthrax I think.\r\n\r\nHaven't posted on Typophile in years! Last time I came
  here a few years ago the site was gone, good to see it back up, was always a great
  community!\r\n\r\nAny help would be great"
