  stray fonts into families at will? For instance, my office has a mangled list of
  about 33 Times New Roman versions strewn throughout our font list. I would like
  to somehow wrangle them together so that my design team is not searching all day
  for the condensed version etc.\r\n\r\nWe use both Mac and PC. I am hoping for a
  solution that suits both systems (hahaha) but I will of course settle for either.\r\n\r\nThanks!
  Let me know what you know!"

    in the program itself. But are you saying there is a function that will group
    the fonts together for use in other programs? \r\n\r\nBasically, I want to be
    able to scroll down my font list in illustrator/Indesign, and only have: \"Helvetica\"
    with all the different helvetica related typefaces contained therein. Does this
    make sense?\r\n\r\nIf FontExplorer X can do that, can you tell me how? \r\n\r\n "

    most font licenses don't allow modifications like this\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
