    alt="sample"> <BR> <BR>There are a couple of subtle differences between the two
    s&#39;s and the two e&#39;s that make me think it&#39;s handlettered. <BR> <BR>A
    great commercial font in a somewhat similar vein, though noticeably different,
    is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/spring/">Spring</a>: <BR> <BR><img

    <BR>I do love this style of handlettering, though, especially when it&#39;s done
    in &#40;or paired with&#41; watercolor. See <a href="http://www.art.net/Studios/Visual/Jillbell/portfolio.html">this
    page</a> of Jill Bell&#39;s portfolio. She&#39;s fantastic.'

  body: Thank you for your imput! <BR> <BR>I had to scan the logo on buff paper and
    this writing was in bright green... So this image might have been altered a bit.
    On original two &#39;e&#39;s look pretty close. &#39;s&#39;s are similar, too.
    <BR>So I really hope there is a  font exist somewhere, because I really don&#39;t
    want to re-draw these. <BR> <BR>Thank you!

  body: There is something really close to this at a  <BR>foundry who&#39;s name I
    can&#39;t remember! So  <BR>helpful! It&#39;s the one with all the display types  <BR>for
    signage. Their most famous one is called  <BR>truckstop or something. The sample
    I saw  <BR>was made to look like Kraft salad dressing  <BR>packaging. The type
    was almost this as I  <BR>recall. Someone please help my brain. <BR> <BR>R

    <BR> <BR>See, I&#39;m not loosing my mind. :-&#41; <BR>I think that&#39;s about
    as close as you&#39;re going to  <BR>get. I concure that this is hand lettered,
    but I  <BR>bet if you used the roughen filter in Illustrator  <BR>you could get
    a close enough match. <BR> <BR>R
