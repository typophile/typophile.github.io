  body: "Grafotechna came into existence in 1951. Goudy Oldstyle was designed in 1915
    but the family wasn't fully complete until after 1918. \r\n\r\nI strongly suspect
    Veneziana was not licensed from ATF for two reasons: 1) it isn't named Goudy Oldstyle,
    and 2) it may have fallen under the restrictions of one or more of the several
    laws passed by the US during that era (1948-53) in the effort to control export
    of US goods or aid (which may have included IP licensing) to Communist countries.
    Luc Devroye writes that the foundry was operated by the state so that may have
    had some bearing on any restrictions. "

    I think that regardless of who actually cast the font you are safe in saying it
    is a ripoff."

  body: "<blockquote>This is one of the few specimens where Jaspert failed to provide

    in the Encyclopaedia of Typefaces are inaccurate. Also, research in this field
    would have been so much easier today if the authors of the Encyclopaedia would
    have mentioned the sources on which they based their entries. 1920 can be anything.
    A typo, a guess, maybe even a date from specimen from a Czech foundry that was
    a predecessor of Grafotechna and eventually released the same typeface under another
    name in 1920. I presume that there were several foundries in the regions that
    became Czecho-Slowakia after WWII before all typefounding activities in the Czech
    republic were united in Grafotechna. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I expect Venezia to be
    a rip-off of Goudy Old Style. The fact that sometimes the original designer is
    referred to is not necessarily proof of any license agreement. The rip-offs in
    the catalogues of many phototypesetting and digital typesetting system manufacturers
    from the 1970s and 1980s (Alphatype, Autologic, Bitstream, Compugraphic, Scangraphic,
    AM Varityper, just to name a few) also often refer to the original designers and
    even to the original names of the typefaces, although neither the designers nor
    the foundries which first issued the typefaces ever saw any money. "

    like the system used in the music business, that whenever a song is broadcast
    on air, or in a store, mall etc. the broadcaster would have to make a payment
    to an agency that would make payments to creators/owners based on usage. I have
    no idea how this would work in practice.\r\nDon"
