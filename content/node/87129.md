body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm finally in the coding stage of making my first really extensive
  font, including small caps, Russian and Greek (which will include polytonic). But
  I'm no OpenType codemaster. So in order to get my font to actually work, and do
  all the tricky little things like convert Turkish and polytonic Greek correctly
  to small caps, etc., I decided to use this strategy: I opened up a similarly extensive
  font that I have, and planted all my characters into it, so I could use code that
  was already proven. \r\n\r\nBut the ranges of glyphs don't match exactly, so I'm
  left with a bunch of code that applies to Vietnamese glyphs and such that don't
  exist in my font. So I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is this whole strategy a
  dishonest thing to do? (I personally don't see it as stealing code\u2014I look at
  it like this: the coders who came before me blazed the trail in figuring out the
  right way to code all this. I'm just repeating what they figured out, as if they'd
  discovered a useful math equation and I were employing it. But maybe this isn't
  the prevailing way to look at it in the type design community. That's what I want
  to know.) Or perhaps, is it an ill-fated strategy, where I'm bound to end up tangling
  myself up in a confusing mess?\r\n\r\n2. If it's okay to proceed on my current path,
  is it possible in FontLab to delete a bunch of characters and, at the same time,
  delete all references to them in the font's OpenType features file? Because as it
  is, when I try to compile, FontLab insists on creating new copies of all the characters
  that I had just deleted, and won't compile if I tell it not to do that. \r\n\r\n3.
  If I should really be doing this from scratch, can someone point me to a place where
  I can learn how to build my code from zero, and understand it, and have it do everything
  it needs to do in order to function as a professionally usable OpenType font?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a million!\r\n\u2014Nathanael"

  body: "Note that I'm hardly an expert in this area, but my gut feeling is that,
    while there's nothing wrong with studying other people's code to get an idea of
    how things are done, pasting your own glyphs over an existing font crosses a line
    -- even though you've removed the original glyphs you're still basing your work
    on a copyrighted file made be someone else.\r\n\r\nAn alternative which you might
    consider, though, would be to look at various fonts which have been released under
    OFL/GPL or some other variant of Open/Free software license. Some of these may
    even include .vfb or .fea files which would allow you to read their original code
    rather than FontLab's decompiled version thereof, and open licenses would probably
    allow you to use that code as a basis for your own code.\r\n\r\nLet me reiterate
    that this is my 'gut-feeling' reaction rather than a legally or ethically informed
    opinion.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "One other thing -- as I mentioned, studying other people's code to get an
    idea of how things are done seems OK to me, but the emphasis here is on the value
    which other people's code might have to you gaining an understanding of how OpenType
    coding works. The approach which you are suggesting in your post isn't one that's
    going to further your own understanding of the subject since you're essentially
    taking the entirety of someone else's code, deleting references to nonexistent
    glyphs, and then keeping your fingers crossed that everything's going to work
    properly for your glyph set. Without doing your own coding, you're not going to
    get a good feel for why people include the code they do and how it actually does
    what it's supposed to do.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Okay, I see what you're saying. As regards not actually learning how to code
    for real, that's one thing I'd actually be okay with not knowing, if I could avoid
    it. Mainly because there are a lot more things that I'd rather do than sit at
    my computer writing hundreds or thousands of lines of code. If we continue my
    equation analogy, it's like saying I'm fine with using the quadratic equation
    even if I have no idea how to derive it. But I guess as a fontmaker, I'll have
    to learn this stuff anyhow... such is the life, huh?\r\n\r\nSo does anyone have
    a favorite starting point for learning how to write OpenType code that works?
    Or is the method basically to scrutinize other fonts' code and figure out what
    each line means, then do the same things myself?"

    snippets galore, quite often with explanations. In addition, there's the [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html|Feature
    File Syntax list]], something you definitely want to bookmark for further explanations.
    I think it's the Definitive Reference, btw.

    are already starting to become clearer. Thanks!
