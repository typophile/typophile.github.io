  The business is essentially a job agency and the name is derived from the English
  word \"time\" and its German equivalent \"zeit\". \r\n\r\nPlease have a look at
  the attached file and let me know what needs further improvement. Thanks a lot for
  any input!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6564.png]"

    was supposed to be. Why does the guy at the top left not have his arm behind the
    guy at the top right?\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure that the combination of 4-fold
    rotational symmetry and a German name is a good idea - the negative space <cite>sort
    of</cite> looks like a swastika.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    It scares me. I just don't get it. Even after reading the comments i have no idea
    what the mark is supposed to represent. Do you have any other ideas? Have you
    thought about a word mark without the symbol?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "OK, you are right. The implementation was a bit of a nightmare here, though
    I'm still convinced that the idea itself should work quite well, if it is implemented
    with more attention to detail. Please have a look at the changes I just made:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6203.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    an earlier thread I had explored some other concepts, most of them with a clock
    in it, however this is a people business, not a clock business. So I thought including
    a human element in the logo would be a good way to go.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

    trust me, I didn't see that swastica until you told me!\r\n\r\nTo eliminate any
    ambiguity here, I could reduce the number of people to three. But there wouldn't
    be any resemblance with a clock then...\r\n\r\nThis is an idea somebody else came
    up with in an earlier thread: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_6144.png]\r\n\r\nI
    like it a lot but it makes the company look like a watch business, no?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: "Is there going to be a tag line used? It may help you determine whether you
    need an icon or not with the logotype. I think your latest post is interesting.
    \ although the space between the \"i\" and \"m\" looks too loose to me.\r\n\r\n\"I
    like it a lot but it makes the company look like a watch business, no?\" \r\n\r\nbut
    with the name Time Zeit won't people automatically think of watches and clocks?\r\n\r\nIt
    may be over done and too complicated for your mark but the time 9:00 - 5:00 \"9
    to 5\" typically represents a work day (here in the states anyway. I would assume
    other countries have a similar phrase) I'm just throwing this out there to get
    you thinking about time, people and work in more meaningful ways.\r\n\r\nThe posting
    prior to the straight typographic solution, had lost the swastica look to me (and
    actually looked more like a button). That is what happens with symbols, people
    attach cultural and personal meanings to them. I think you deftly altered the
    mark to erase any connections to a swastica. How do you feel about that design?
    I get the sense that you prefer the 4 people concept over the logotype."

  body: "This new iteration (blue and black) is much better. It actually looks a little
    like a compass now. I also don't think that reducing the number of men to three
    is a good idea - it will look a lot like the ubuntu logo then.\r\n\r\nWhat does
    your one colour version look like?\r\n\r\nAn idea - if each of the four guys had
    two hands, there would be a total of twelve dots around the circle, like a clock.
    Don't know if this will work, look good, or whatever, but just a thought.\r\n\r\n

    is too much and the second colorpallette (blue, flesh and black) doen't work for
    me.\r\n\r\nAaaah, now I see the 4 men.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it could be so difficult
    to see is because of the bright white.\r\nIt gets a lot of attention.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you could alter it so that the 4 men get all the attention?"
