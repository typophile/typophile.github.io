<p>I&rsquo;m trying to pull some research together for a college project, and was wondering what people would consider to be well executed, and/or well known logotypes. I was thinking along the lines of avant garde, coca-cola and fedex, can people think of anything else?</p>
<p>Your help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Sorry, I was under the impression that a logotype was a logo solely comprised of type, such as the examples I gave? Is what you&rsquo;re talking about not referred to as a glyph?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The term &ldquo;glyph&rdquo; came about in the late 1990s I believe. It means something like &ldquo;sort,&rdquo; but does not have quite the same connotations. In modern (Unicode) usage, a Greek capital &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; can be the same &ldquo;glyph&rdquo; as Latin capital &ldquo;A&rdquo;, but they are different characters. It would be odd to use the term &ldquo;sort&rdquo; here; the notion of having both Greek and Latin in a single metal font would be unusual. Caslon Greek would be thought of as a different font in the old days (&ldquo;old&rdquo; meaning before the 1990s). In type cases, they would be thought of as different sorts only because they would be in different cases. But if you ran out of <em>A&rsquo;s</em>, you could use an <em>Alpha</em> &amp; not loose meaning.</p>
<p>And while all logotypes are sorts, not all sorts are logotypes. &ldquo;Sort&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t specify what is unique about logotypes (two letters on one body). It would be the same as saying we don&rsquo;t need the term &ldquo;ligature&rdquo;, because &ldquo;sort&rdquo; or &ldquo;glyph&rdquo; is sufficient. (see note)</p>
<p>By the way, there were logotypes in systems other than Linotype. With foundry type, a Q with a long tail required a &ldquo;Qu&rdquo; logotype.</p>
<p>It may be that in the past few years &ldquo;logotype&rdquo; has come to mean a logo consisting only of type, I don&rsquo;t know. While words can change meanings even in formal usage, that would seem to be a bit far. Sort of like expecting everybody to know what &ldquo;dudine&rdquo; means.</p>
<p>(note): A &ldquo;ligature&rdquo; means tied letters; by extension, used where elements of the two letters touch, such as the glyphs <em>fb</em>, <em>fk</em>, etc. The individual characters in logotypes (old usage) were not tied; nothing touched, hence not &ldquo;ligatures.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In addition to the two-letter sorts that Charles has explained, I believe that &ldquo;logotype&rdquo; also referred to catchphrases and other complete words set as a single metal sort. (Hence the derivation of the term.) A printer&rsquo;s glossary I have from 1924 gives the definition: &ldquo;Logotype &ndash; Two or more letters, or a whole word, cast on one body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some cases, a company would have had it&rsquo;s name specially cast up as a single sort, perhaps in a variety of sizes, to facilitate the setting of advertising material, especially once the practice of custom, identifying marks became a common part of business practice. This might have been more frequently a zinc etching rather than a proper type-metal sort, but I think the term was still applied.</p>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve inherited the usage that is pretty common today, where a company&rsquo;s distinguishing wordmark is referred to as a logotype.</p>

<p>If you can prove to me that you did not, until this discussion, know that &ldquo;logo&rdquo; and &ldquo;logotype&rdquo; mean (and have meant for many years) &ldquo;distinguishing wordmark,&rdquo; well . . .

<p>Seriously, I&rsquo;m not going to tell half-truths on the Typophile forum. Had I known the advertizing zinks were termed &ldquo;logotypes&rdquo; the same as the two or three-character Linotype mats, I&rsquo;d have said so.</p>
