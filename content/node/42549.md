body: Does anyone know of any good open type faces. Similar to caslon open face? I
  like that one small but when large it's too heavy.

  body: Arno Pro comes to mind. This is way more massive than most people need, but
    it's also just a beautiful typeface.

    [[Optical Scaling]].\r\n\r\nOver the last years, several foundries have published
    good text font families with optical sizes.\r\nCheck out <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html\">Adobe\u2019s
    line-up</a>. Or [[Sumner Stone]]\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/itcbodoni.html\">ITC
    Bodoni</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html\">Cycles</a>.
    Or <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/collections/index.php?collectionID=700001\">Hoefler
    & Frere-Jones\u2019 faces</a>. Or \u2026\r\n\r\nFor Caslon: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/founders-caslon/\">ITC
    Founder\u2019s Caslon</a> has optical sizes. You can also simply combine matching
    fonts and, for example, utilize <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/carter_cone/big_caslon/\">Big
    Caslon</a> by Carter & Cone for large sizes.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: <a href="http://p22.com/lanston/caslon.html">LTC Caslon</a> is quite a bit
    lighter than Adobe Caslon, perhaps this will give the right weight you need for
    large sizes?
