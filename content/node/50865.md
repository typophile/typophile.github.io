  typesetting. I'm located in NYC and wondered if anyone was aware of any resources
  like any still existant typesetters, bookstores and or graphics designers willing
  to part with theirs.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

    ended up in the Columbia U. library and I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s plenty
    more in the holdings of the three big design schools. If you\u2019re looking for
    a specific hard-to-find book email H&FJ to see if they have a copy in their library
    that you can look at.\r\n\r\nAs for purchasing, your best bet is to just search
    Amazon, Abebook, Alibris, and Ebay. You might have to do some Google searches
    to track down the correct names first. Finding specimens in stores isn\u2019t
    easy; the last time I was trying to find them in New York the best lead I got
    was a phone number for an appointment-only antiquarian vendor."
