  body: "I\u2019m with Jan. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s <strong>a</strong> fette Fraktur.\r\nBack
    in the days, fonts didn\u2019t necessarily have genuine names, but were described
    by their genre. Almost every foundry had some fette Fraktur. The known digitizations
    are based on the Stempel version, which before was distributed by C.E. Weber,
    which in turn goes back to the one designed by Johann Christian Bauer and released
    by  Joh. Peter Nees & Co. Of course there are differences from version to version.
    If you don\u2019t know about the origin, I doubt that you can track down \u2013
    or assign \u2013 a proper name. \r\n\r\nThe B and D in <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/f/fettehaenel.htm\">Fette
    Haenel-Fraktur</a> are a better match. The other characters aren\u2019t. Do you
    have a full alphabet?"

    of the Rob Roy Kelly American Wood Type Collection</a>, Hamilton named it <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/a_ah/rrk/specimen.php?type=Script&sub=Blackletter&specname[]=German%20Full-face&specname[]=German&specname[]=German&specname[]=German%20Condensed&specname[]=German%20Condensed&specname[]=Prussian&specname[]=German%20Composite%20Condensed&top=blackletter&folder=B_3_4A&text=RRK_B_3_4A_03.rtf&img=B_3_4A_Spec_03.jpg&count=3&countmax=6"><em>German
