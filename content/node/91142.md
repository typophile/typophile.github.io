body: "I used to think I was smart. Then I started trying to use Python with FontLab.\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to install RoboFab in my FontLab. I'm using Fontlab v5.0.4 in Windows XP.
  I've read everything I can find about how to install it, but either they're all
  just cruelly hinting at how to do it (\"Installation in Windows is usually straightforward\")
  or I'm thick enough that it seems that way to me. \r\n\r\nThis is what I think I
  know. I need to:\r\n\r\nDownload RoboFab from the internet \u2014 check.\r\nUnzip
  it \u2014 check.\r\nPut it in some folder, somewhere \u2014\_??\r\nRun the \"install\"
  command in FontLab \u2014 After trying various folders to put RoboFab in, I've gotten
  to where I can do this, but when I try to run any other things from the RoboFab
  dropdown menu, it says I don't have something called \"robofab.world\".\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone explain to me, as if I were a very stupid person, what I'm supposed to do,
  or point me to somewhere on the internet that does that? I can tell that Python
  might save me a lot of effort, if only I could figure out what to do with it.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: I hadn't in fact seen that. Thanks a ton! I'll post again if I still can't
    figure it out for some reason.

  body: "This seems to have worked. I've managed to use a few tools. \r\n\r\nJust
    so I'm clear, when I use RoboFab, do I have to do it through the text-based macro
    editor, or should there be some commands in a dropdown list in the Macros toolbar?
    I don't see RoboFab anywhere in the Macros toolbar. "

  body: It comes with some scripts. You need to put these into FontLab's macro folder.
    I don't know where this is on Windows.

  body: "The RoboFab developers are getting tired of the installation problems too.
    It's not supposed to be so difficult. And it didn't use to be so difficult either.
    But factors beyond our control, unfortunate decisions by the FontLab developers,
    assumptions by the Python.org developers, and the mercurial needs of Apple, have
    slowly turned \"FontLab\" a very fragmented and problematic environment.\r\n\r\nThis
    [[http://vimeo.com/38359791|Robothon2012 talk]] explains some of the Python version
    issues.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between Robothon 2009 and Robothon 2012, Frederik
    Berlaen wrote [[http://doc.robofont.com|RoboFont]] from scratch. And Georg Seifert
    took [[http://glyphsapp.com|Glyphs]] from a demo to an AppStore title. Each with
    its own philosophy, but both with scripting and python layers, attentive developers
    and thankfully straightforward installation steps. And UFO to glue it all together.\r\nIn
    that same interval FontLab updated FL Studio from 5.04 to 5.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
