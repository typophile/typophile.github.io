body: "Hey everyone!\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since my last post, but I've become
  very intrigued in this typeface. Now attending college, the OED has become one of
  my greatest tools, and the typeface used for the header in each entry (\"definition,
  n.\" below in red) is gorgeous. If I'm not mistaken, the serifed text in the definitions
  are also of the same family.\r\n\r\nThough, I have to say, without the \"fi\" ligature,
  this particular example is not so pretty.\r\n\r\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated
  as always!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/definition_5078.png]"

  body: "I see some similarities, but the \"d\", the \"f\", the \"i\",the serifs on
    the \"n\", and the \",\" all appear to be different to me.\r\n\r\nI'm really focusing
    on the Red text, though the other serifs may be the same, the red text is what's
    most important to me.\r\n\r\n-Sam\r\n\r\n[Edit] In looking at the stylesheets
    used by the definition pages on oed.com, I found \"font-family:Georgia, Times,
    'Times New Roman'\". This could very well mean I was wrong and Georgia is the
    correct font, but I have to say, I still feel like there is a lot of difference.
    Perhaps the rendering on my computer is just weird?[/Edit]"

  body: It's definitely Georgia. I guess there's some rendering weirdness somewhere,
    but I recognized it as Georgia as soon as I saw it, and the stylesheet confirms
    that. The other fonts are also Georgia (some of them bold or italic), except for
    the IPA in Lucida Sans Unicode and "View as..." in Arial.

  body: "Alright, no worries. Thanks for the help guys.  What was really throwing
    me off was whether or not the serifs were flat horizontals, or at a diagonal.
    Every sample of Georgia I looked at had them different than the example from the
    site, but that could very easily just be my screen.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the
    help!\r\n\r\n-Sam"
