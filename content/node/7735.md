body: I&#39;m trying to find the perfect face for an art dealer who handles American
  artists, many from the earliest years of America...Also some contemporary stuff.
  <BR> <BR>My client wants an identity that creates a relationship with its customers,
  who are 50&#43; years old men who buy the art as a sign of wealth and achievement
  associated with hard work. Additionally, client is interested in how banks, brokerage
  firms, and other high-class businesses portray themselves and what they emphasize
  in design. <BR> <BR>With all that said, I&#39;ve gotten a few ideas from &#34;world
  wide webbing&#34; and Bringhursting. <BR> <BR><a href="http://tiro.com/Plantagenet/plantagenet_index3.html">
  Plantagenet Novus</a> by Tiro <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon-3-caslon-540/">
  Caslon</a> Not perfect, but hey. I like it <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/electra/">
  Electra</a> Dwiggins is American, style is neoclassical <BR> <BR>I like Bringhurst&#39;s
  mention of Ben Franklin and Baskerville, in that Ben and John were buds and Ben
  used Baskerville to correspond to the federal style of American architecture. Anybody
  got details on this?

  body: I think your Neoclassical angle is right on. <BR>But of those three fonts,
    only Plantagenet is close, and not even very. <BR> <BR>My first choice might be
    [a] Walbaum. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Walbaum is too late, maybe. He was working in the 1800s. And his work isn&#39;t
    &#34;American&#34; at all, at least from what little details I know. <BR> <BR>Of
    course, maybe you could determine when Walbaum&#39;s type was introduced to the
    US. If that era correspond to the type of furniture that the shop is selling,
    it could be a go

  body: 'Historical fidelity is one thing, good design is another. <BR> <BR>The story
    about Franklin doing a switcharoo is true &#40;if one of his letters to Baskerville
    is to be believed&#41;, but it was done in the States, and only one way: he took
    a Caslon specimen sheet, tore off the top, and showed it to a Baskerville-hater
    saying it was Baskerville, getting the predictable layman-in-expert&#39;s-clothing
    response. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I&#39;m only digging Storm Type&#39;s <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/walbaum.html">
    Walbaum</a>. <BR> <BR>Looks Filosophia-esque, but the caps are cash money for
    the letters I have to use for the logotype. Also, those numbers are great. It&#39;s
    also not too expensive. <BR> <BR>Additional thoughts? I still really like Plantagenet
    Novus.

  body: Is Plantagenet Novus even available for licensing? <BR> <BR>If you are looking
    to buy a font family, licensing one from Storm Type &#42;would&#42; be a very
    good idea.

  body: What about Matthew Carter&#39;s <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/20027.html">Monticello</a>,
    based on Binny &amp; Ronaldson&#39;s types used by Thomas Jefferson. It is one
    of those typefaces I would love to have an opportunity to use.

    Monticello</a> is pretty nice. I am making a note of it. Thanks, John.

  body: Dan did you do any research on competitive resources. I bet they all have
    websites you could visit. It might give you a better lay of the land.  <BR> <BR>On
    Franklin.  <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t hear from him last year, I haven&#39;t heard
    from him this year and if I don&#39;t hear from him next year, I&#39;m going to
    write him a letter. George Washington. &#40;oops George W&#41;
