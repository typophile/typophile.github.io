body: "I have come upon 2 complete cabinets from Hamilton Mfg. co. Completely full
  of many different types and sizes of what appears to be steel lettering. Also have
  around 60- 70 picture plates from the late 1800\u2019s to the 1960\u2019s. Some
  with the articals to go with them. Also have printing letter box, and many extras
  to go with it. Including spare parts and several manuals and books for an intertype
  press. All were used in a small town newspaper. Newspaper is aprox. 130 years and
  still going. I am looking for a VERY knowlegable person to figure out what I have!!!\r\nAll
  of this is for sale if you are interested... "

  body: I guess you need a museum experts to put value on what you have. Since you
    hold the 1800's era of items, surely that is very rare and many collectors will
    be interested to that. I have seen cabinet with vintage type of door at <a href=http://caldwells.com/
    rel=dofollow>http://caldwells.com/</a>, many have put interest on the door alone,
    and you know how much it is, it is a 5 figure stuff.

    they let their domain name expire.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the remnants of the Mfg.

  body: The cabinets were manufactured by Hamilton, but not the type. Look on the
    side of an individual letter sort and see if there is a small embedded symbol.
    This would tell you what foundry made the type.

  body: My friend has to large cabinets together as a bar  table with these. all completely
    there, i was looking through them. she has different sizes and fonts, very beautiful
    i believe she said something about it being for a type writer, like those giant
    ones they used for posters and such you'd see as signs, before they ever had printers
    to do it for them.

  body: "I'm the Faculty Advisor of the Shakespeare Press Museum on the campus of
    Cal Poly is San Luis Obispo, California.\r\n\r\nI realize that the post has been
    up a long time, but this information may be valuable:\r\n\r\nAll of this looks
    very familiar to me. The cases, as already noted, were made by Hamilton Mfg. in
    Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Those were made into the 1960s, and these look quite nice.\r\n\r\nThe
    cases you show open are called \"California Job Cases\" and they appear to be
    in good condition. The type is made (mostly) of lead, and depending on the machine
    that cast the type, small amounts of tin and antimony are added for hardness and
    shrink-prevention.\r\n\r\nThe labels on the faces of the cases should indicate
    what the fonts are.\r\n\r\nThe engravings you show are probably zinc or copper
    photoengravings. These were common up into the 1960s and early 1970s. There is
    nothing particularly valuable about them, except that they might have interesting
    images on them.\r\n\r\nThey make nice collector's items.\r\n\r\nThe type and the
    cases are quite valuable to any book arts printer, hobbyist printer or letterpress
    production printer. I recommend trying to sell them locally (or you could donate
    the entire thing to a museum in your area). Shipping lead is REALLY expensive,
    and it would be exceptionally difficult to pack the cabinet without taking the
    type out of the cases and packing it to prevent damage. The lead is quite soft,
    and will get hurt if it falls even a two inches to a hard surface.\r\n\r\nI suggest
    that it is much more valuable as a package of working type and cases. Don't sell
    it piece-meal, as that does no justice to the real value of a good collection
    of type in good condition. There are many people who would love to use this type!\r\n\r\nYour
    local historic museum might be interested in the engravings, as they may have
    local historic value. Otherwise the engravings are not worth much.\r\n\r\nBrian
