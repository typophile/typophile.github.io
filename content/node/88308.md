  \u2013 such a template which divides a page in two (or three) columns, <em>with</em>
  a dividing line between them, where the entries would be divided by a specified
  spacing (spacing after paragraphs) and the first line indented <em>or</em> where
  the entries would feature hanging paragraphs?\r\n\r\nAny code suggestions?"

  body: Typophile James Crippen wrote a Tlingit dictionary with XeLaTeX. His sources
    are available at http://www.drangle.com/~james/dictionary/. To get the vertical
    separating line, you only need to add one line of code using the command <code>\setcolsepandrule</code>.

    at the end of the definition of the environment <code>dictsubentry</code> (in
    <code>\\newenvironment{dictsubentry}</code>)."
