body: "Seeing as how the good folks at Typophile are making rumblings about improvements*,
  I figured to throw out something. It's not some breakthrough idea, but I'm hoping
  it gets enough traction that sooner rather than later it becomes a reality.\r\n\r\n*
  http://typophile.com/node/65428\r\n\r\n<strong>Let's have a way of pointing at things
  on images embedded in threads.</strong> The obvious reference is Flickr (adding
  a \"note\" to an image). It doesn't have to be anything fancy - it might even start
  out as an asterisk or something you place on an image, and it links to a post below
  that talks about it. Ideally it would be nice to be able to write text (or even
  draw? :-) directly inside the note. However it would also be nice to have any text
  (or image) replicated (preferably while indicating that it's a duplicate) as plain
  text in/as a post like it is now.\r\n\r\nObviously this is not a trivial task. It
  might be possible to do without Flash* but certainly Flash would be the ideal medium.
  But it would remove a very large obstacle in the way of giving valuable feedback
  on something, thus increasing the quality and quantity of feedback.\r\n\r\n* For
  example there might be software that takes an image, makes a second one with the
  notes on it, and you could see that by clicking on the orginal image in the thread
  (or via a -very slow- animated GIF).\r\n\r\nBesides making Typophile [even] more
  useful, I think it will bring the most important thing about this site (no, it's
  not type IDs...) back to the forefront: type critiques.\r\n\r\n<strong>What do you
  guys think?</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd if we need to raise money for this, here's an idea:
  we have a system where a person who wants to use that feature pays a yearly or one-time
  fee of a few dollars, and his account would then have it enabled. We could even
  have tiers where you can get to view the notes but not add any, for a smaller fee;
  in that case not paying anything would prevent you from seeing any notes (just the
  original image).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "This is a great idea. For example being able to comment type samples via
    something like Flickr's \xABnotes\xBB would be awesome (and very helpful), potentially
    making critiques easier, clearer and less cluttered.\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if it
    worked without Flash, for accessibility (like thinking of mobile devices). And
    I think it can, potentially even with more complex possibilities than just adding
    an asterisk (which would already be very cool though). BTW, I believe Flickr's
    \xABnotes\xBB don't use Flash, but I might be wrong. XHTML/DHTML is pretty powerful,
    if a bit more twiddly to develop. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure that having people draw
    into images is really necessary \u2013 for one thing, drawing with a mouse at
    that tiny size will be a pretty coarse affair, plus there's visual clutter to
    mind, especially when more than one person does it.\r\n\r\nI don't get the duplicating/replicating
    thing."

    It could also have some simple \"MS Paint\" like features which allows you to
    draw on images, fill, erase or write things. "

  body: "Hey, get Apple to add some real features to the iDon't. Not to mention a
    proper hi-res screen so you can do more reading and less panning & zooming; 160
    ppi is so 2007.\r\n\r\nNina, by replication I meant that any comment (or maybe
    even graphic) on the image should also be accessible in the traditional comments
    area.\r\n\r\nDarrel, that would be nicely easy, but it doesn't seem right to depend
    on another site (and require people to create a leechy Yahoo account).\r\n\r\nAbout
    the \"painting\": maybe all we need is a set of typable graphic primitives, like
    lines, arrows, etc.\r\n\r\nMore on fundraising: if it's too financially risky
    to build first and charge later, Typophile could collect in advance and in the
    worst case refund people if it doesn't work out. I think there's enough goodwill
    here for that to work (or at least build enough confidence to take the plunge
    and eventually raise the rest of the money).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
