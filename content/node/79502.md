body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn the last issue of Fortune Mag (Feb 2011), you can see a 3D version
  of what I believe is the Solano font.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"thumbnail\"><a href=\"https://skitch.com/aldo/r1n76/venture-2\"><img
  src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20110228-dirnf4k7at838n5e41eq9x585c.preview.jpg\" alt=\"venture-2\"
  /></a><br /></div>\r\n\r\nAre you aware of a 3D version of this font? If yes, where
  could I find it.\r\nDo you know a quick way to achieve this kind of effect? (ie
  an illustrator plugin)\r\nIs there similar font out there? What would be the keyword
  to dig those out? (English is not my primary langage)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n3D
