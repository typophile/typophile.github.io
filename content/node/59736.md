  complexities of web design and coding. But after a layoff and with a lot of free
  time between freelance gigs, I'm hoping to get caught up and learn some interactive
  design.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations for good books on Flash, DW, or a combination
  of the two in application?\r\n\r\nOf course, any seasoned advice on learning web
  from scratch would be great, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n--Stubborn print designer."

    the app and a video than to try and read through tutorial books. They also avoid
    problems with inaccuracies caused by text not being well-updated for new versions
    because it\u2019s much easier for video editors to catch mistakes; if something
    the author is discussing doesn\u2019t really work, it\u2019s pretty obvious in
    a movie."

    a go, as I really don't know enough about the web department. I tried one of their
    one session webinars before, and found it interesting and useful.\r\n\r\nhttp://creativetechs.com/tipsblog/free-10-week-flash-course/"

    of their Hands On Training books, which I used to teach myself Flash, the videos
    are probably a good way to go.\r\n\r\n(By the way, with the books, you get a CD
    or DVD containing the files you need for the exercises, plus some video content,
    too.)"

  body: "The Adobe Classroom in a book series is good. There are books on Flash, Dreamweaver,
    and ActionScript (Flash programming). I went through the latter, in order to get
    up to speed on AS 3.0, which is very different from the old 2.0.\r\n\r\nThe books
    are sometimes boring, but they have detailed step-by-step instructions that ensure
    that you learn all the basics of the program.\r\n\r\nI also second the Linda.com
    suggestion."

  body: "A useful web HTML/CSS book that I'd recommend is \"CSS Mastery\" by Andy
    Budd. It has very useful examples and does a good job of breaking things down.
    Granted this is not Dreamweaver or Flash related. But you really should learn
    the fundamentals before figuring out which tool to use...\r\n\r\nAnd learn ActionScript
    3 if you're serious about Flash. It will be tough (it's like learning a new language,
    with grammar and all) but it's the way to go. The Flash help files can be useful
    in this regard, with code and examples that you can learn from.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Flash is limiting unless you know AS3, and AS3 is a pretty big jump if you're
    just starting out programming. And with HTML5 on the horizon, by the time you
    get your chops who knows where Adobe will be in this space (still not on the iPhone
    I bet).\r\n\r\nIf I were you I'd go the Ajax route and get up to speed with JavaScript/jQuery
    & HTML/CSS. It's been gaining momentum since the new generation of browsers contain
    very fast JavaScript engines. It's also the \"open web\" so you can at least take
    some comfort in knowing it will be supported by the major browsers."
