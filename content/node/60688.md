  name is Kelly I am a stay at home mom of four. Finally getting back into the real
  world of work lolol doing business cards for some people. They have existing cards
  just want them updated to a more modern feel. They like the fonts they have but
  I have as of yet to be able to match these two........they look the same to me but
  not sure if they are.\r\nPlease help in any way you can. \r\nHave a great day/evening
  lol\r\nThanks in advance all.\r\nKelly aka gvg"

    from Adobe. The bottom font is just awful... you could close your eyes and pick
    a better font. ;)
