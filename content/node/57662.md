  body: I knew I saw a digital version somewhere! It's from Paul Barnes' <a href=http://www.moderntypography.com/Typedesign/Classics/CaslonItalian/index.html>Classics</a>
    collection. The <a href=http://www.stbridetype.com/>St. Bride Type Foundry</a>
    doesn't appear to be in operation yet, but you could e-mail him to ask about availability.
