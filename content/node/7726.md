  <BR>In the InDesign manual it states pretty clearly that PC fonts, TT and T1, should
  be available to InDesign on OSX when put in InDesign&#39;s own Fonts folder. Neither
  me nor my printer have been able to get this to work. Is this one of those, er,
  &#39;unfeatured documenteds&#39; like the InDesign Interchange format? <BR> <BR>TIA,
  <BR> <BR>Rob

    <BR>Question regarding PC Fonts &#43; InDesign &#43; OSX <BR>&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;
    <BR> <BR>I think the only fonts ... PC fonts ... that would be available to Indy
    on OSX would be PC OpenType fonts. But I could be wrong.'

  body: Windows Type 1 fonts always worked fine for me in InDesign on Mac OS &#40;even
    back in ID 2 on OS 9&#41;. Just had to put them in either the shared Adobe fonts
    folder, or the ID private fonts folder, per the documentation. <BR> <BR>Note that
    a Windows Type 1 font consists of two parts, the .PFB and .PFM files. Also, as
    always you need to make sure that you don&#39;t have any conflicting fonts installed
    that use the same names. Mac OS, and OS X even more so, ships with a bunch of
    TrueType fonts &#40;now packaged as dfonts&#41; that have the same names as common
    Type 1 fonts. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    fonts OSX can use?  Make things so much easier.
