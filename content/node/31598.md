  body: Why would you describe it as "ugly"?  It may not be [[Carol Twombly's]] best
    face, but I quite like it in certain uses -- in fact, I recently did a brochure
    that combined Lithos with Tiepolo and it was a big hit with the client....

  body: I don't know if I'd call it "ugly", but I'd <em>never</em> use it. I think
    it's a cultural thing.
