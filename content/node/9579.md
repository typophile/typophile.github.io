  by Mr. Thorsten Weil on 3rd March 2005 to this Typophile forum, I would like to
  add the following remarks to Section 2 on &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;: <BR> <BR>     2.
  The Typeface in the New York Subway System - Basic Commercial <BR> <BR>     As far
  as sans serif text faces go, you&#39;ll always be on the <BR>     safe side with
  this old favorite: the Basic Commercial font <BR>     family epitomizes clear and
  objective design. These classic <BR>     forms have very few unusual qualities,
  and remain both <BR>     lively and legible in all weights. Perhaps this anonymity
  is <BR>     the reason that Basic Commercial&#39;s style has been popular <BR>     with
  graphic designers for decades! <BR> <BR>     Basic Commercial&#39;s design has a
  century&#39;s worth of history <BR>     behind it. The typeface was distributed
  for many years in <BR>     the United States under the name Standard Series, where
  it <BR>     worked its way into many aspects of daily life and culture: <BR>     for
  instance, it was the face chosen for use in the New <BR>     York City subway system&#39;s
  signage.  <BR> <BR>     Grab all eight Basic Commercial font styles together in
  one <BR>     low-price value pack:  <BR>     <a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-2387-6/basiccommercialvp.html"

  <BR> <BR>1&#41; &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; by Adobe <BR> <BR>More than 15 years
  ago, in 1989, Adobo published the font &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; with the following

  contends with reference to this Adobe copyright notice that it was Adobe that created
  in the year 1989 this &#34;font software program&#34; as &#34;original work of authorship&#34;.
  <BR> <BR> <BR>2&#41; &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; by Linotype <BR> <BR>About 5 years
  ago, in 2000, Linotype published exactly the same font. &#34;Exactly the same&#34;
  means that both fonts &#40;Adobe&#39;s &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; and Linotype&#39;s
  &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;&#41; have completely identical glyphs and that both fonts
  are completely identical &#34;font software programs&#34;. <BR> <BR>However, in
  the &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;, Adobe&#39;s copyright notice was removed and replaced
  by this notice: <BR> <BR>&#34;Copyright &#40;c&#41; 2000, 2002, 2003 Linotype Library

  to this Linotype copyright notice that it was Linotype that created in the year
  2000, i.e. 11 years later, this &#34;font software program&#34; as &#34;original
  work of authorship&#34;. <BR> <BR>Is it possible that Linotype, more than 10 years
  later and completely independently created a &#34;font software program&#34; that
  is hundred percent identical with a &#34;font software program&#34; created by Adobe
  more than 10 years ago ??? <BR> <BR> <BR>3&#41; Morris Fuller Benton <BR> <BR>Bruno

  2004: <BR> <BR>   &#34;Basic Commercial <BR>   Designer Morris Fuller Benton, 1900  <BR>   About
  Basic Commercial&#40;tm&#41; <BR>   Basic Commercial font is based on the design
  for Akzidenz Grotesk, <BR>   which appeared with Berthold in 1900, designed by type
  setters whose <BR>   names have not been recorded, but whose skill cannot be overlooked.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>This means that Bruno Steinert contended that &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;
  was designed by the Berthold designer Morris Fuller Benton in the year 1900. <BR>
  <BR>However, Morris Fuller Benton never designed the &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;,
  nor did he design Linotype&#39;s &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; which is 100% identical
  with Adobe&#39;s &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;. <BR> <BR>In &#34;LinoLetter&#34; of
  March 2005 &#34;Designs Determined to Inspire&#34;, Bruno Steinert now tells a new
  story. Now, he does not mention &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;, &#34;Berthold&#34; and
  &#34;Morris Fuller Benton&#34;. These names are now discarded by him. Instead, now
  in 2005, Bruno Steinert contends that the &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; is identical
  with the font &#34;Standard Series&#34;. He declares: &#34;The typeface was distributed
  for many years in the United States under the name Standard Series&#34;. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s
  summarize: According to Bruno Steinert, the font &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; by Linotype,
  which is identical with the font &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; by Adobe, was created
  by Morris Fuller Benton in 1900 as &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; for Berthold, and
  Bruno Steinert distributed this font for many years in the United States under the
  name &#34;Standard Series&#34; and Bruno Steinert created the &#34;font software
  program&#34; for this typeface in the year 2000. Correct? <BR> <BR> <BR>4&#41; The

  which is downloadable as forgers.pdf from the website <BR> <BR>    <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.de/fontdocs"
  target="_blank">http://www.sanskritweb.de/fontdocs</a> <BR> <BR>In this report,
  Linotype&#39;s &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; alias Adobe&#39;s &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;
  alias Berthold&#39;s &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; is seen from the point of view of
  public prosecutors and criminal court judges. In this report, Bruno Steinert is
  described as a font forger who forged the &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; by the &#34;Linotype
  Method&#34;. <BR> <BR> <BR>5&#41; name removed by moderator <BR> <BR>Those who want
  to have a look at the &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;, but who do not want to waste money
  on this font forgery by Bruno Steinert, may visit name removed by moderator <BR>
  <BR>url removed by moderator <BR> <BR>These fonts do not contain the copyright notices
  so that criminal investigators cannot decide whether the fonts at the name removed
  by moderator are Adobe&#39;s &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; or Linotype&#39;s &#34;Basic
  Commercial&#34; or Berthold&#39;s original &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;. This is no
  surprise, since all these fonts are identical with the exception of the copyright
  notices. <BR> <BR>If you open Berthold&#39;s &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; with a font
  editor and replace the Berthold copyright notice by the Adobe copyright notice,
  you create Adobe&#39;s &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;. <BR> <BR>If you open Adobe&#39;s
  &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; and replace the Adobe copyright notice by the Linotype
  copyright notice and additionally replace the name &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; by
  &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;, you create Linotype&#39;s &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>If you open the name removed by moderator fonts and replace the name &#34;Basic
  Commercial&#34; by &#34;Basic Crimes&#34; and if you insert the notice &#34;Copyright
  by Criminals&#34;, you create a general-purpose version for the criminals in the
  font forging industry. <BR> <BR>Any lawsuits instituted against the name removed
  by moderator would be most interesting from the legal point of view, since all three
  fonts are identical: <BR> <BR>Mr. Harvey Hunt of Berthold would contend at court
  that it was he, who wrote the &#34;font software program&#34; of &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;
  &#40;&#34;Copyright by Berthold...&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Mr. Thomas Phinney of Adobe
  would contend at court that it was he, who wrote the same &#34;font software program&#34;
  of the same &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; &#40;&#34;Copyright by Adobe...&#34;&#41;

  body: Your point in earlier mails seems to be that fonts can&#39;t be copyrighted,
    despite the fact that courts have supported font copyright.  <BR> <BR>But the
    above case, even if true, seems to relate purely to trademarks. The fact that
    font vendors go to extreme measures to avoid using or referencing other people&#39;s
    trademarks is understandable. Trademarks add more protectability to 100 year old
    designs than copyright, design patent, EULAs and big sticks combined. <BR> <BR>Even
    if it turns out that copyright strings in fonts are worthless, I think including
    them sends a good message to the uninformed that the font isn&#39;t public-domain
    and was probably provided under some kind of license.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

    astonished that the moderator removed the name of the website which offers the
    &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; font WITHOUT THE FALSE copyright notice. <BR>  <BR>
    <BR>1&#41; Copyrightability of Computer Programs in US <BR> <BR>&#62; Your point
    in earlier mails seems to be that fonts can&#39;t be copyrighted, despite the
    fact that courts have supported font copyright. <BR> <BR>I did not say so! On
    the contrary: In the US, computer programs &#40;which, by the way, are defined
    by US courts as &#34;literary works&#34;&#41; are copyrightable since 25 years
    &#40;since the enactment of a certain amendment in the year of 1980&#41; PROVIDED
    THAT certain requirements, which I have described, are fullfilled, namely &#40;1&#41;
    firstly that a computer program is only protected by copyright if it is a creative
    work, and &#40;2&#41; secondly if the author of this creative work is a human
    being that has written the source code of this computer program. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    the SOURCE CODE requirement which was rejected by other members of this forum
    as &#34;so scurrilous and wrong&#34;  &#40;William Berkson&#41;, I give a short
    example: <BR> <BR>My grandmother does not know the PostScript programming language
    and she cannot write the source code of a PostScript program. Therefore she can
    never be the programmer &#40;=author = copyright owner&#41; of a PostScript program.
    <BR> <BR>The same is true for PostScript Type 1 fonts: My grandmother cannot write
    the source code of PostScript Type 1 fonts, and therefore she can never be the
    programmer &#40;= author = copyright owner&#41; of a PostScript Type 1 font. <BR>
    <BR>A computer programmer, who reads this &#34;grandma example&#34;, will be most
    astonished to learn that the other members of this Typophile forum are of the
    opinion that persons who are NOT computer programmers and who do NOT know the
    PostScript programming language and who are NOT able to write the source code
    of PostScript Type 1 font software programs, claim to be the programmers &#40;=
    authors = copyright owners&#41; of PostScript Type 1 font software programs. This
    is very, very strange indeed! <BR> <BR> <BR>2&#41; Trademark Notice <BR> <BR>&#62;
    But the above case, even if true, seems to relate purely to trademarks. <BR> <BR>No,
    no! Copyright law and trademark law are two completely different laws. By stating
    <BR> <BR> &#34;Basic Commercial is a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen
    AG&#34; <BR> <BR>Mr. Bruno Steinert made it clear that &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;
    is a trademark. This statement is correct and it is legally sufficient, but this
    trademark notice refers to the trademark law, not to the copyright law. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>3&#41; Copyright Notice <BR> <BR>&#62; Even if it turns out that copyright
    strings in fonts are worthless <BR> <BR>Here begins the crucial part of the case.
    The copyright notice is not a declaration that you can add to a font just for
    fun. This would be highly dangerous: The copyright notice is a fully binding legal
    declaration which must contain the whole truth and nothing but the truth, since
    the copyright notice is similar to making a declaration in lieu of an oath. <BR>
    <BR>In the &#34;Copyright Law of the United States of America&#34; downloadable
    as Circular 92 at the website of the Copyright Office &#40;I do not mention the
    link for fear that the moderator removes the link&#41;, you will find the regulations

  body: Mr. Ohnesorg. My phrase &#39;scurrilous and wrong&#39; referred to your accusations
    against Mr. Phinney, not to your claim of a &#34;SOURCE CODE requirement&#34;
    for  fonts.  <BR> <BR>Your &#39;source requirement&#39; seems to me just wrong
    as far as the current state of the law. I confess I know little about this whole
    matter, but I do know that the law is determined not by any person&#39;s theories
    about it, but rather by what legislators enact and judges rule in interpretation
    of the law. You do not seem to grasp that whatever the logic or illogic of your
    argument, it is not the law unless a court agrees with it.  <BR> <BR>Currently
    Judge Whyte seems to have the last word, and he doesn&#39;t agree with you. So
    for your argument to become law in the US you would have to convince another court
    in the US that you are right, and Judge Whyte wrong.

    Fuller Benton made a lot of Gothic typefaces, e.g. Alternate Gothic, Bank Gothic,
    Clearface Gothic, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Raleigh Gothic and others. I examined
    all these fonts, but none of these Benton fonts is identical with Linotype&#39;s
    &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;. <BR> <BR>As regards the Franklin Gothic by Morris
    Fuller Benton, to which you refer by quoting Ansel M. Olson&#39;s chapter on &#34;Franklin
    Gothic&#34; from the book &#34;Revival of the fittest&#34;, we see that Olson
    writes &#34;... intended to COMPETE with ... e.g. Akzidenz Grotesk&#34;. But a
    font that COMPETES with another font is NOT IDENTICAL with another font, UNLESS
    it is a pirated copy or a knock-off imitation of the other font.  <BR> <BR>Furthermore
    Ansel M. Olson does not mention &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; at all in connection
    with Morris Fuller Benton and therefore he does not answer the question whether
    Mr. Bruno Steinert&#39;s legally binding copyright notice declaration &#34;This
    Basic Commercial typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&#34; is
    a false fraudulent copyright notice or not. <BR> <BR>If a judge at a criminal
    court looks at the comparison picture attached below, he will easily recognize
    that &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; and &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; are completely
    identical, whereas &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; and &#34;Franklin Gothic&#34; are
    completely different, and hence the criminal court judge will easily recognize
    that Mr. Bruno Steinert&#39;s declaration that &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; is &#34;original
    artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&#34; is a false fraudulent copyright notice intended
    to make gullible font buyers believe that &#34;This typeface is original artwork
    of Morris Fuller Benton&#34;. <BR> <BR>If an art seller declares: &#34;This painting
    is original artwork of Vincent van Gogh&#34;, although this artwork was not made
    by Vincent van Gogh, then this art seller is a criminal. And if the font seller
    Bruno Steinert declares &#34;This typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller
    Benton&#34;, although this artwork was not made by Morris Fuller Benton, then
    Bruno Steinert is a criminal. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>W.O. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4102/66730.gif"

  body: 'Dear Mr. Gianotten, <BR> <BR>Why is your message of 6th March misleading?
    For the simple reason that you do not mention &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; in your
    message, nor is it mentioned in the book quoted by you. However, in your Dutch
    statement, you mention it, and also the &#34;juridische verwikkelingen&#34; between
    Adobe, Berthold and Linotype. <BR> <BR>The professional font forger Bruno Steinert
    has been selling the font &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; since SEVERAL YEARS &#40;since
    at least two years and a half&#41; with the fraudulent claim &#34;This typeface
    is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&#34; and with the fraudulent claim
    &#34;new typeface&#34;. <BR> <BR>Many of the dim-witted managers in advertising
    agencies and design studios who are the font-buying customers of Bruno Steinert
    and who had already bought the font &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; sold by Bruno Steinert
    until year 2000, have bought AGAIN exactly the same font thus paying TWICE for
    the same commodity, because these dim-witted suckers of advertising agencies and
    of design studios have been cheated by the fraudulent lies of Bruno Steinert claiming
    that &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; is a &#34;new typeface&#34; and &#34;the original
    artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&#34;, and therefore have been mentally unable
    to recognize that the font &#34;Basic Commercial&#34; sold by Bruno Steinert since
    year 2000 is identical with the font &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; sold by Bruno
    Steinert until year 2000. <BR> <BR>Most members of this Typophile forum consider
    it as customary that font-buying suckers are cheated by fraudulent font sellers.
    This explains why they begin to doze off, if someone tells them that fraudulent
    copyright notices are customary. That is why Mr. Papazian released &#34;deep,
    reverberating snoring sounds&#34;. <BR>  <BR>In my previous message to this thread,
    I made this conditional &#34;if-then&#34; statement: <BR> <BR>If Mr. Bruno Steinert,
    manager of the Linotype GmbH, cannot prove that Linotype&#39;s &#34;Basic Commercial&#34;
    was published FOR THE FIRST TIME in the year 2000, then he is a copyright criminal
    according to section '
