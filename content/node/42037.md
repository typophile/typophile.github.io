body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI've recently been enjoying looking at feltron.com's annual
  reports. I really like the infographics he's put together there and there are a
  couple of fonts I'd love to be able to identify.\r\n\r\nThe first ones are the typefaces
  used on the <a href=\"http://feltron.com/index.php?/content/hello_china_introduction\">Hello
  China, Goodbye Nepal</a>. (I've got a close match with garamond, and thought futura
  for the smaller sans - but it still doesn't look right)\r\n\r\nexample - http://feltron.com/images/uploads/hc01c.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  other I'm very keen on identifying is the tall slender caps typefaced used on the
  <a href=\"http://feltron.com/index.php?/content/2007_annual_report/\">annual report</a>\r\n\r\nexample
  - http://feltron.com/images/uploads/ar07_03.jpg\r\n\r\nI thought i had this nailed
  with Block Gothic RR Light Extra Condensed, but there are still some discrepancies.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions appreciated.  I've tried all the usual identifying tools, alas no luck.\r\n\r\nCheers"
