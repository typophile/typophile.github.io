  I'd share in case anybody missed it. \r\n\r\nFrom the article:\r\n\r\n\"Type runs
  parallel with fashion... Just like any other genre, you've got your taste makers
  that can take anything and position it in the right place and all the sheep will
  follow. That happens with type. The joke around here is \u2018ok, we like it,' that
  means once we put it out there, it won't be as popular as we think it will be, because
  we're really into it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.connectsavannah.com/news/article/101679/]]"
