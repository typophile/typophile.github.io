  body: I can&#39;t believe WhatTheFont can&#39;t find it. It looks so familiar to
    me. That S is a dead giveaway -- or at least it should be. I was sure it was in
    the package Adobe used to group with Brush Script, Hobo, and Dom Casual, but I
    can&#39;t remember the fourth one. Am I that far off?
