		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Simon that the question is a bit open-ended. There are so many aspects of a digital type company (or any company, for that matter) to evaluate, that you really need to define what your goals are. A few areas and questions that I would start to consider would be: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. aesthetic quality of product <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. technical quality of product <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. marketplace presence and penetration <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. ability to market and promote products successfully <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. consumer and customer satisfaction with the product <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6. quality of customer service <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7. quality of technical support <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8. do they 'get' the web?

		<div class="commentbody">Yes,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been a little soft on defining the question. Recently I have concluded, almost, a series of improvements to Lanston. We are about to release all our old fonts with the EU currency sign. I know we are late but we have had our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nasty acts of god<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that slowed us down for several years.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next begging phase is to complete our new type faces. Which we have several waiting. Then the task of developing a project plan for digitizing new releases. However with my energies going to that sector of the business, marketing is doomed to suffer. You can appreciate the problem.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finland is unusual in that their government officials forcefully advise against hiring. The obvious solution is to find a healthier business environment, or sell Lanston. I might add, also, Finland is the most expensive place to live in Europe because of their social programs. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Translate taxes.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am therefore looking into both options. This is why I could use input from the forum. It may be of interest to others also in evaluating their own assets. I am a qualified expert in assessment for brick and mortar type foundries. In fact I have worked in serious litigation in Boston doing that very thing. I was an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expert witness.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> As you all know, I purchased Lanston, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/RoadToLanston.html">http://www.lanstontype.com/RoadToLanston.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> also I made a bid for ATF but they were unable to provide a secure lease. I raised 40 million dollars to put towards purchasing English Monotype.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Digitized intellectual property has no fixed value,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> unlike ingots of lead, which do. But surely there is a business formulae that can determine such value. A simple rule of thumb, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->font company business is worth ( x ) years gross income?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be a good starter. Brick and mortar companies, such as printing companies, the value is often calculated as say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one years gross plus fixed assets, inventory, good will, lease and contract considerations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> However, intellectual properties should have a higher evaluation for cash flow derived from font sales. A printing company doing one hundred thousand dollars work per year requires skilled staff, serious rents, major capital expenditures, material cost etc. The owner will only make a small income for himself. A single owner operated font company could, with some work, achieve a gross income of half that and live very comfortably. Not rich but comfortable.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When selling a digital font company pretty much all of its value will be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->taxable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> That would not be the case in a modern printing company. Or, in days gone by, brick and mortar type foundries. In other words, you will be getting perhaps only half of what the buyer is paying you. Computers depreciate to zero before they are paid for. So expect nothing or next to it for those considerations. In fact best to leave them on your desk.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Font delivery <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(downloads)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to customers is almost zero and usually absorbed by the marketing cost. The work is in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->creating the asset<!-- raw HTML omitted --> itself, plus, a modern consideration, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->web site development asset.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Some other considerations have already been mentioned, or asked. It should be easier to determine a font companies value now the market is mature.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it may be a good exercise for some font developers to consider there may be a day they may need to evaluate their own works. Some day, hopefully, there will become <!-- raw HTML omitted -->such a need<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for at least one of you, or your heirs. If fonts have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no value<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I recommend another creative occupation should be pursued.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So one may ask someone with a respectable font, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how much they would sell all rights to that type face?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Perhaps that is the right question to ask. Naturally some fonts outsell others. So maybe a calculated average of all the type faces in a foundries stable would provide reasonable conclusion. Also some fonts will remain dormant until they are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fad of the moment.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Plus, consideration for existing performing contracts. And Web Site evaluation. One thing Lanston has that many others do not, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->brand name.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> That supports good will, I know some will scoff but I care to differ on that particular matter. Good will, is worth something because it eases the pain of the purchaser to making their decision. Some of those customers may be large corporations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am also, as an alternative, looking into moving Lanston to St. Petersburg, Russia. Other options are possible I suppose. A joint venture or, partnership.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our income <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is not huge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but steadily growing. Our digitized work is substantial and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->name brand font recognition value is substantial.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps for a start the question would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;business&quot; is worth (X) years &quot;gross income&quot;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next step is, what is it worth to manufacturer a font to commercial standards? This answer will be of great interest to many.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To solve the initial question of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->business is worth (X) years gross income.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> What value would a type developer in the Forum sell one good font with all rights not royalties? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I realize some people will hope I do not get offers, or that I do not get much for the business. But if that is the case it will set some precedence for font business evaluation. So it would be best to wish me good luck! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe someone would like to buy Lanston?  Don't  be afraid to make an offer. At the moment I have a particular opportunity that I  am interested in pursuing so this would be a good time. Also depending on the arrangements, I may finance most of the purchase. Perhaps one of you, or a small group should put some heads together and make a proposal. One of my key issues, which means I  will consider less, is that I do not wish to getted  bogged down with months of accounting and legal issues. That I am looking for a simple, clean deal. Further I do not wish to work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but would consider continuing in some aspect through the transitional phase.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Gerald, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your question to me seems more obvious that you may suspect. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lately the rule of thumb I've been aware of is that a companys buyable value is worth 3X its total gross income of its most recent fiscal year end. So, a foundry that grosses $100k per year could be purchased for $300k outright. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Costs related to &quot;prior&quot; software development efforts are essentially mute in regards to the eventual purchase price of the foundry. It's time and money invested during the course of the business and essentially a final sale. . . <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beyond that, while digital foundries have very few material assets that can be estimated as an approximate value compared to a metal foundry, it is very important to distinguish they cannot be considered in this manner. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A digital foundry should be considered a software company, much like Adobe, Quark, Pryus, you name it. We make software, not metal slugs . . .  Our only assets for sale are the hours taken to develop the software as well as the source code of the software. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is that worth? As little as the seller is willing to take for it. . . <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in the end, regardless if you are able to purchase the foundry, chances are you're better off simply creating a new one for free and save all that money to reinvest in your own business. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stuart :D</div>

For most of those years one might expect to be eating out of trash cans. I am speaking of consumer fonts, not custom. In other words I predict it would take more hours to come up with completely fresh products with market awareness for $300k worth of work which is what you anticipate to sell the company for. Most importantly, starving through it. Probably it would be best to buy with the other persons money which would take only three years making the fourth and following years free. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You see what I am getting at. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But this part certainly is a key. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, a foundry that grosses $100k per year could be purchased for $300k outright.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This interests me very much. I am wondering how you came up with this figure? And certainly I must agree, it is impossible to evaluate a  lead type foundry the same way as a digital foundry. Admittedly there are some similarities.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or maybe Lanston should not be compared evenly to other font companies. Such as there are many idle assets waiting. Some can make money without any work except by having to eat in a fancy restaurant, travel to an exotic location for free and sign a piece of paper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One example is that we have a contract that is worth $75,000 however the term of payment is only $700.00 per year of which about 5 are now exhausted. They paid $5000 up front. The nice aspect of this contract is that Lanston did the work in the twenties. Nothing digital. So all the money is strictly a license for &quot;intellectual property, not data&quot;. All the same $700.US comes in mighty handy. Not so handy when I have departed. For someone else it will however. I can tell you the $5000.US came in very handy. I lived in Canada and our dollar was down, down, down. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intellectual property has proven to be a  long term payer. In the EU new regulations protect for 70 years after death. I may have mentioned this before, a taxi cab driver that listens to the radio when he or she is driving a customer has to pay a &quot;song royalty?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let us examine Times for example, most of the money was made long after the designer was dead. The company still does well with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some how there has to be, or should  be a factoring of this sort of consideration. In other words I believe this to be unlike an ordinary software company in that very few software companies <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;make money for old rope&quot;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Software has a very short shelf life, font design has a proven history of hundreds of years. So the shelf live of type design is long I suggest an extension of the amortization figure. I refer to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3X its total gross<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the question that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3X its total gross<!-- raw HTML omitted --> invites, would any type designer sell their font for three years gross royalties? We speak of consumer fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What do you figure the cost of making a new font would be? How much does  Adobe, or Agfa value their fonts in annual reports? Are they flat rate averaged. Production based figures. Or are they sales based, or blending of the two? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Small note. I have always felt it to be a mistake for type designers and font companies to think of themselves as &quot;software companies&quot;. I prefer the wisdom of Sol Hess at the Lanston Punchcutting Department. He insisted Lanston was in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->art business.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Certainly there are unmistakable parallels to the music industry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the early days of digital typeface making, I sort of resented people who had never even seen (an assumption on my part) the operation of a casting machine or the cutting of a punch or matrix, using the designation &quot;foundry&quot; in their company name. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you get right down to it, as Gerald Giampa has noted, type of today uses many of the terms that have survived from metal type through phototype, up to current technologies.

In spite of all that effort, I still make more money from the casters, panotgraphs and printing presses. This is not a whiney complaint; merely an observation that surprised me when I added everything up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only partly in jest: perhaps anyone using the designation should be obliged to spend a week in a working foundry  getting  dirty and scorched. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this regard: I am waiting to hear from a couple of people who have voiced interest in spending two free days with me in type cutting and casting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What IS a good replacement name for &quot;foundry&quot;? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't mind the term 'foundry' in reference to digital type makers. I do object to the occasional loose use of the term, when it is applied to companies that merely resell fonts. One of the nice things about the term foundry is that it emphasises a manufacturing process. In these days, when anyone with a piece of font editing software can play at making type, it is perhaps good to be reminded of the tradition of technical quality and innovation that the foundries of the past established.</div>
