  I occasionally use online print shops. Does anyone have recommendations for online
  printers that have decent quality at a reasonable price?\r\n\r\n(I think this has
  been discussed before but I can't locate the thread.)"

  body: "For Print On Demand, Lulu is good for simple things, or Blurb or Lightning
    Source for more advanced or higher-quality projects. Stay away from Createspace;
    their quality is bad and they have ridiculously rigid design constraints.\r\n\r\nThese
    places are only for book printing; I haven't done any other types of jobs with
    online shops."
