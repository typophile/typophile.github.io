    <BR>Rick Poynor&#39;s keynote last night provoked some interesting discussion
    - along the lines of &#34;who wouldn&#39;t you work for&#34; thread. <BR> <BR>Cyrus
    talk was a repeat of his TypeCon talk - still worth listening to again. Gerard
    Unger is currently banging on about bitmaps - you&#39;d love it. Although it seems
    to be sending some of the people around me to sleep ;-&#41; maybe they
