  body: "Thanks Jan! That was spot on!\r\n\r\nAny info on the typeface? I'm not a
    big fan of 'free' fonts, but this one looks good (with a 'slight' copied feel
    to it).\r\n\r\nThe website (http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/gemnew/home.htm)
    doesn't have any info."

  body: I guess I was hoping for some of the typeface's history. Was it designed with
    a purpose in mind? Is it free for commercial use? Maybe even a bio on the designer.
    The usual stuff I learn about a font before I use it on a project.

  body: "GEM Fonts are mostly the works of Graham Meade, from Australia (I think).
    I will not judge Graham's work, but I have been generously helped by him in the
    past with samples and information on some of his script fonts. I think 'originality'
    is a difficult call when fonts resemble other fonts. Mikey has shown us fonts
    with strong resemblances to Helvetica, but then that might be possible for so
    many fonts, in general, especially sans families, that I am wary about making
    accusations. Well known foundries have often been willing to 'tweak' the designs
    of other foundries and offer them as their own. One only has to look at the old
    metal type catalogs of Linotype and Monotype to see how often they imitated each
    other (now they are parts of the same company).\r\n\r\nStepping down from soap-box
    now.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for the info Mike; and you make some good points!\r\n\r\nBut what
    worries me is the info you can get on GEM Fonts in its website and what you can
    get on the Linotype page. The fact that Graham Meade offers free fonts and there's
    no contact form on his website or even a comment from him on dafont further fuels
    my skepticism.\r\n\r\nBut I have to admit, there's no typeface that I can spot
    that matches Walkway enough to make it clear to me it is, in fact, a copy."
