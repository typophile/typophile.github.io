  | Myfonts]] and [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/gatf/wolverhampton | Fontspring]].
  \ Wolverhampton is a new Neo-Victorian face from Greater Albion Typefounders.  It's
  something of an example of starting with a small idea and running with it.  This
  family of three typefaces (Regular, Small Capitals and Capitals) was inspired by
  a line of lettering seen on a late 19th Century enamel advertisement made by Chromo
  of Wolverhampton (hence the family name).  The family grew, topsy-like, from a recreation
  of these initial fifteen capital letterforms to the three complete typefaces offered
  here.  The three typefaces are ideal for advertising and poster work with a Victorian,
  Edwardian, or 'Steam-punk' theme.  They would also be eminently suitable for signage
  inspired by the same eras or (as we've seen a number of our other typeface families
  prove very popular) for book covers of period related novels and historical works.
  \ Finally, these slender elegant display faces are just plain fun!\r\n\r\nHere's
  a small sampling of the three faces:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wpton_5142.png]"
