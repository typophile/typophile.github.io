  yogh in?\r\nThe \u201CMonotype Sabon Pro Regular in OpenType Pro format\u201D on
  the Linotype site has only seven characters from the Latin Extended-B code block,
  none of which are \u021D.\r\nOur setters are working on a publication in Sabon,
  and we've just realized it's going to need to be able to set Old/Middle English.
  So probably eths and thorns and wynns and all that sort of stuff at some stage,
  but yogh in the immediate term.\r\nIf all else fails, which of the free \u201Cbig\u201D
  fonts d'you reckon is closest? I've tested a stretch of Sabon with Gentium yoghs
  and thorns in it, and it doesn't look <em>too</em> bad...\r\n"

    likely to find something useful [[http://www.mufi.info/fonts/|on this page]].
    Look closely, those glyphs get not always mastered well.\r\nIf you need the yogh
    et al. in more than just Regular, look [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=215&changelang=2|there]]."

    thanks, Andreas, I was aware of the existence of those, but hadn't figured that
    they were going to be my best options. I'll check them out in more detail later,
    but at first glance I think one of the first three (Alphabetum, Cardo, or your
    own Andron) looks like it's going to be the best match."
