  it's a pretty basic font and it's just slanted and resized for effect.  please help

  body: Right on Jan...thank you so much for the help.  It was hell getting it too
    look close to that logo and I think I did alright.  It's funny how many of these
    titles and logos out there are just simple fonts. Thanks again Jan.
