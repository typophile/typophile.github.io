  it.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know the typeface used for \"WIRED\" magazines masthead and
  body and headings?\r\n\r\nThe masthead looks like mix of sans serif and a slab/humanist/geometric\r\n\r\nAny
  help would well....help!!\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I remember discussing this and when I did a search for 'wired\" <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/60752\">Node
    60752</a> popped up first. Some of the type at the time was a custom typeface
    called <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100035&affiliateID=33\">Tungsten
    </a> from H&FJ but that was just released last month.\r\n\r\nHere is a cover image
    for good measure.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wired-cover_4417.jpg]"

    I'd suggest [[http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Morgan/mudTyper+Weights/|Morgan Avec]].\r\n\r\nGood
    catch Jeff. Tungsten slipped my mind."
