body: I started doing this a while back. Wulf Barsch showed up to a class and noticed
  a case of Staedtler Lumograph pencils. <cite>"Did you know that these were created
  for the purpose of drawing on foil?"</cite> No I didn't know that. It was worth
  a try. It was only after writing in foil though that I began to take seriously the
  idea of making type from my handwriting&mdash;an idea I had kept for a long time.
  There comes with writing on foil a remarkable feeling of the medium pushing back;
  have you ever noticed that?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0139_5615.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0138_3558.JPG]

    Or is it just meant as is?"

    a package or make custom tags for gifts.

  body: "It's a different medium, that's all. What I like best about it is the foil's
    reaction to  a soft pencil. It's slick, so it's similar to writing or drawing
    on photo paper with a wet permanent marker; but because it gives just a little,
    it lends some control to the curves. That helps a lot\u2014both to achieve the
    look you want first\u2014and later if you're doing something like overlaying bezier
    curves.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0164a_5157.jpg]"

  body: But you're creating a negative impression when you write. How are you getting
    a positive like on the top example of your cursive?
