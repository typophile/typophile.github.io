body: "I have teamed up with rummik (rummik.com) to make an online font editor called
  <a href=\"http://www.fontclod.com\">Fontclod</a> (with a purposed typo of 'cloud').
  Alpha 0 was released earlier today as a proof-of-concept, and includes placing,
  deleting, moving points, and basic save/load (copy/paste in the upper-right text-box).\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://www.fontclod.com/screenshots/alpha0.png\">\r\n<!--break-->\r\nWe want
  to develop it into a fully featured font editor, with optimization for mobile platforms
  like iPad. But to do so in a relatively short time frame, we need financial backing.
  At present, higher sums = higher priority on feature requests, but you can pledge
  any amount. Those who are willing to pledge sums of 150+ USD will also get free
  access for unlimited font hosting when this feature is implemented. There is a support
  button on the bottom right.\r\n\r\nTo make the best editor possible, we need your
  input! If you have any features you would really like to see, or any misgivings
  about other font editors, please list them here! Also please feel free to use this
  as much as you can for testing, just let us know when you spot bugs! Feel free to
  discuss here.\r\n\r\nWe plan on trying to have at least one release in any given
  work-week.\r\n\r\n<strong>Some planned features of Fontclod:</strong>\r\nWe plan
  to keep all the basic editing functions free\r\nMultiple font editing\r\nInterpolated
  editing tool (like interpolated nudge or Fontlab's interpolate function)\r\nImporting
  and exporting to UFO\r\nMost functions supported by UFO\r\n\r\n<strong>What we don't
  plan on doing at this point:</strong>\r\nNon-cubic contours\r\nHinting\r\nBitmap
  fonts\r\n\r\nRight now we want to focus on basic editing functions, so we wont be
  doing importing or exporting to standard formats yet. The format is just a JSON
  representation of the internal data structure. If you would like to tackle a simple
  converter, please contact us.\r\n\r\nSoon we will be having some surveys to help
  us decide the best interface layouts. (You can tell us your opinion right now if
  you want.)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to recieve updates on Fontclod, <a href=\"https://profiles.google.com/artistenator/\">circle
  me on Google+</a>, I will be making announcements there. <a href=\"http://www.fontclod.com/text/changelog\">A
  changelog</a> is available by clicking the version number at the top. (Which also
  includes known bugs, and contact information.)\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<a

  body: "> you guys should totally merge your project with Raph\u2019s\r\n\r\nThere
    is one problem with merging Fontclog and Fontly: licencing. Part of the framework
    Fontclog is using is closed source, and Fontly will be presumably released under
    the GPL license. The viral nature of GPL prevents us from using it. I did contact
    Raph, though he hasn't gotten back to me. Fontly does appear to be dead right
    now.\r\n\r\nThe font format, and almost all of our drawing and editing functions
    will be available free (libre) in libraries, probably under either the LGPL or
    BSD license. We'd like to release a stand-alone version using XULRunner eventually,
    allowing anyone to contribute to the codebase. All the libraries would be shared,
    so most of the functions on the web will be available open-source, on your own
    computer (without the use of PHP).\r\n\r\nTouching Spiros: We very much would
    like to use Spiro splines eventually. There really needs to be a better Spiro
    implementation than fontforge's. To move font editing along further, we also need
    to get beyond beziers. To do this, unless Raph releases part of Fontly (there's
    a pseudo-working online Spiro example here: http://fontly.com/sandbox/spiro.html)
    in a more friendly license, like LGPL or BSD, we'll have to write our own Spiro
    interpreter completely from scratch. There's no reason the two projects shouldn't
    be able to share code, though.\r\n\r\n> What I'm getting at is, this type of activity
    seems too \"casual\" to\r\ntypically lead to an entire font; it's hard to see
    anybody who makes\r\nfonts be seriously opposed to installing an editor on his
    computer.\r\n\r\nI can see your point, but I would beg to differ. For those of
    us who use multiple computers day-in-day-out, not having our software on every
    system is frustrating, and there are times that we can't install the software
    on every system because of licensing issues, build problems because of OS, or
    inability because of outside restrictions. An online font editor (coupled with
    cloud hosting for fonts) would allow you to edit fonts from <em>anywhere</em>
    I would take this very seriously. And this would allow use, out-of-the-box, of
    editing on mobile platforms like iPad and Zoom. This also removes cross-platform
    development woes all together.\r\n\r\nImagine this: A man works on his font project
    before work, on his Mac, then continues work on his iPad riding on the sub, at
    work he's able to continue during his break on Windows. All the while he doesn't
    have to worry about copying font files between devices. While most of us probably
    don't want to drink type in the way, the possibilities are all there.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I mean is, there's no reason to call this a toy. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> Difficult to
    work with it on Mac\r\n\r\nA fix for this will be in the next version. :) I do
    have a Mac, but mainly I'm using Linux now.\r\n\r\n> Nice but, uhm, no undo?\r\n\r\nWe're
    going to try and squeeze this into the next release also.\r\n\r\nThe main reason
    we've posted it this early in development was in order to get some alpha funding
    to help pay for development, but so far no one's taken the bait! Our time isn't
    free here. :)"

  body: "<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpha1.png\">\r\n\r\nReleased alpha 1!
    Most of the bugs from the last release are fixed. Rendering of the glyph being
    edited is rewritten, so it's a lot faster. The ability to select multiple handles,
    and nudging has been added! You can remove handles by selecting them and pressing
    backspace. Press space to move the view. Also: preliminaries for multiple glyphs
    (no UI yet), and undo. Read the changelog for everything else. Note: point adding
    is missing from this version, it'll be back next week! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpha1-1.png\">\r\nMoving
    multiple handles at once."

    />\r\n\r\nI decided to go with a more \"minimal\" styling which I thinks work
    better for most webapps. I also decided to go with a more traditional menu structure
    because of the nature of a font editor. Both the tool palette and palettes on
    the right are quite WIP. I haven't decided on a default set of tools or palettes
    yet. The glyph chooser at the bottom will be expandable, and be subset with filters.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    thoughts on this mockup would be highly appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nBrian"
