    printed in red and black, right? Quite a business he built up in the Northeast
    with just dentists, and boy could he do some incredible illustrations with the
    same Coit pen.. There are some fonts by Arthur Baker out there that may satisfy

    so many years & the client doesn't want to try out any of your new alphabetic
    creations... instead they want your stock and trade. Boring but it pays the bills
    and can be done in your sleep, with tender loving care of course.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for finding the website. Haven't talked to that old geezer in 15 years. Actually
    he is one of the brightest, most rounded, individuals I ever met. I will e-mail
    him.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    they were produced? Did Michael scan them himself and work with them in a font
    creation program, or did he collaborate with someone who was experienced with
    the software?"

  body: "I scan them and produce them in Fontographer. I am in the midst of the steep
    learning curve with FontLab. Taught myself Fontographer but FontLab is a completely
    different, and frustrating animal. I have everything really tight before I even
    go into the software so there is no guessing. I am one of those who still spends
    a majority of my time with ink. Actually the digital work is really boring to
    me. P22 does all of the final assembly for me as I have NO expertise with the
    Open Type side of things.\r\n\r\nThank you for the compliment Textwrap. The fonts
    I design are based on lettering done for commercial use. I've no interest in text
    faces, just titling fonts. It goes back to setting copy on the Phototypositor
    in the 80's. Ahhhh, the smell of fixer in the morning and the sight of 2 inch
    idiosyncratic letters in a headline. Love... pure love.\r\n\r\nMichael"
