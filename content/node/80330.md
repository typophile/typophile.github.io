  have been trying to figure out what typeface this is for a while. He claims that
  it was chosen because of its historical significance and \"favor\" by the Third
  Reich, I read one article that even called it \"Fraktur Gothic\" but I think this
  is a mistake. It is possible that it is not a typeface at all but just a one off
  creation, in that case can anyone think of something similar? Love that \"G\"\r\n\r\n"

    is a digitally available typeface that is inspired by early German grotesques,
    and features such a \u2018G\u2019 (apart from that, Ludwig is not very similar)."
