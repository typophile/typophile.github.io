  that there is no application support for the 'locl' feature yet. Thomas Phinney
  agrees that there is none in Adobe products ( yet). But is it in Microsoft Vista/longhorn?
  \r\n\r\n2. Henadij posted some locl feature code here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/15506\r\n\r\nDoes
  anybody know if that code was written correctly? Is there is any sample code for
  this feature? I have been googling but to no avail. \r\n\r\n3. Would anybody share
  their code? I wanted to build some Polish & Czech localization into a font!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "Eben, \r\n\r\nthe code Henadij posted is principally correct but it is better
    to name the glyphs according to the Adobe/FontLab naming conventions: baseglyphname.suffix.
    Fontlab Ltd. recommends that the suffix for localized forms corresponds either
    to the primary OpenType feature name that the localized glyph is associated with
    (that would be \"locl\") or to the OpenType language tag of the primary language
    that the localized form is associated with (that would be \"PLK\" for Polish in
    Henadij's example). \r\n\r\nSo if I wrote the code, it would be: \r\n\r\n@loclPLK1
    = [cacute nacute oacute sacute zacute];\r\n@loclPLK2 = [cacute.PLK nacute.PLK
    oacute.PLK sacute.PLK zacute.PLK];\r\n\r\nfeature locl { # Localized Forms\r\n
    \ language PLK exclude_dflt; # Polish;\r\n  sub @loclPLK1 by @loclPLK2;\r\n} locl;\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    the glyph names \"cacute.PLK\" etc. could be \"cacute.locl\". \r\n\r\nAdobe software
    does not parse the glyph suffixes into anything meaningful yet, but Fontlab Ltd.
    does plan to have some smart algorithms that takes notion of properly formed glyph
    name suffixes. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam \r\n"

  body: Eben, it doesn't hurt to have a locl feature in yout font. And you can also
    "double-up" the feature as a Stylistic Set, which will allow present users of
    InDesign CS2 access to it.

    me at some feature code for a 'stylistic set'? Is the feature called 'ss01'? Or
    is it 'salt?' I bet it's ss01 ( ss02, etc) There is probably some discustion of
    this feature here on typophile. I'd better search for it.\r\n\r\nThanks to you

  body: Also I noticed that when I test The locl or the langage feature in Fontlab
    that my calt features are not available to be applied at the same time. It seems
    to be either or in the Fontlab preview. Willl it be like that in Indesign or other
    apps too?

  body: "<em>Will it be like that in Indesign or other apps too?</em>\r\n\r\nIt certainly
    shouldn't be. Microsoft's approach, which I hope other layout engine developers
    will follow, is to apply the 'locl' feature before any other layout feature, thereby
    setting the localised input glyphs for all subsequent features. Then the 'ccmp'
    feature is applied, and then the other supported features in the order in which
    the lookups are ordered in the font (with some exceptions for complex script handling,
    e.g. for Indic scripts, in which language shaping features are strictly ordered
    by the shaping engine). Once the 'locl' feature has been applied, you should be
    able to apply any other features to the results: the 'locl' feature is certainly
    not supposed to be exclusive."

  body: "Paul Nelson showed a demonstration of 'locl' feature support in MS Publisher
    at the ATypI conference in Rome in 2002 (specifically, substitution of preferred
    Urdu forms of Persian numeral characters). This has not been released though,
    and the fact that he demo'd it doesn't necessarily mean it will be in Office 12.
    MS, like most software companies, won't commit to or comment on functionality
    of unreleased products. They test a lot of things internally that might not show
    up in published software for two or three versions, if at all.\r\n\r\nOn 25 February
    2005, Paul noted on the OpenType developer list that APIs for calling language
    system tags had been added to Uniscribe (the MS Unicode Script Processor), so
    the back end will be in Windows Vista. But applications will need to take advantage
    of the new APIs."

    The original intent of OpenType was that lookups would be applied in the order
    in which they occur in the font. The only reason why Microsoft decided to overide
    this for certain features is the some font developers, who shall remain nameless,
    were getting the ordering wrong for Indic fonts that require very strict feature
    processing for correct display."
