  have found these to be quite hard to find(outside of the quite common speedball
  ones).\r\nSo I was wondering if anyone would have a suggestion of where to find
  good ones, preferably shipping to Europe.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions,\r\n\r\nPaul-Kenji

    (www.johnnealbooks.com). \r\nBesides books, they sell a wide variety of pens,
    brushes, nibs and other lettering and calligraphy tools. They are located in North
    Carolina and ship to Europe."
