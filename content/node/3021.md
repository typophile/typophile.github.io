  the upcoming movie by Wolfgang &#34;Das Boot&#34; Petersen. Obviously, the movie
  is based on Homer&#39;s Iliad. There are two trailers &#40;&#34;Teaser&#34; and
  &#34;Superbowl&#34;&#41;, you can look at the screenshots at: <a href="http://grace.elidan.net/troy/"
  target="_blank">http://grace.elidan.net/troy/</a>  <BR> <BR>The typography of the
  movie is shameless. They use a &#34;custom version&#34; &#40;if you could use that
  term&#41; of Trajan. Not only does a movie about ancient Greece use classic Roman
  type, but also, the modification &#40;horribly extended &#34;R&#34;&#41; is simply
  embarassing. Anything could be better than this bastardized version of Trajan.  <BR>
  <BR>I guess it&#39;s too late to change anything since the movie is due out in May.
  But tf anybody out there has any contacts with Warner Bros., talk to these people!  <BR>

  body: It does look like a modified Trajan-Bold to me. <BR> <BR>And the official
    site throws in Charlemagne and Mason. &#34;Oooh, like old-looking fonts, dude.
    I love it when like the art people from a movie really know their stuff.&#34;

  body: heh. <BR> <BR>When it comes down to it, the average person isn&#39;t going
    to know or care.  If it looks like it fits, it does.  Only type geeks will ever
    know.

  body: 'Chris,  <BR> <BR>but the problem is, it doesn&#39;t look like it fits. The
    extended leg in the R is extremely pretentious, especially when used in every
    single &#34;R&#34; on the credits or poster.  <BR> <BR>An average person is not
    able to tell the difference between Arial and Syntax. But this is not a point.
    When you start being ignorant in details, that ignorance creeps and reaches more
    and more, until it turns everything into pulp. There are movies where set elements,
    shoes or costumes miss the epoque by 200 or 400 years. Usually, such stuff aggregates
    pretty quickly.  <BR> <BR>But it&#39;s not only about moviemaking. Think about
    food: an average person isn&#39;t going to know or care if the manufaturer or
    the cook added genetically enhanced soya, some preservatives.  <BR> <BR>In the
    &#34;Waldorf Salad&#34; episode of &#34;Fawlty Towers&#34; &#40;my recent favourite&#41;,
    the visiting American, Mr Hamilton talks to Basil Fawlty, the arrogant hotel manager:  <BR>[Hamilton]
    What the hell is that? <BR>[Fawlty] Vodka and orange juice. <BR>[Hamilton] Orange
    juice? I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not fresh. <BR>[Fawlty] Isn&#39;t it? <BR>[Hamilton]
    No. <BR>[Fawlty] We&#39;ve just opened the bottle. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s the problem,
    you know.  <BR> <BR>Adam <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>Maybe a reasen for such titlings. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW. Does a studio
    have to pay for type face usage like for art &#40;paintings&#41; in movies?

    in movies? <BR> <BR>Normally, not. Paintings are art, while typefaces are commercial
    products. Usually, font licenses do not specify additional royalties for a particular
    way of use. Also, it is unlikely that licensing models involving royalties would
    work at all.  <BR> <BR>In case of successful movies, type designers usually profit
    because movie posters &#40;or popular book covers, for that matter&#41; often
    make a typeface popular, so it becomes commercially successful. So movie titles
    are sort of free advertising for a typeface.  <BR> <BR>Adam <BR>'
