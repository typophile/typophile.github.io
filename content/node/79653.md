body: "Hello,\r\n\r\njust a word to tell you that the Joos typeface, made by Laurent
  Bourcellier in 2009 and awarded at the TDC in 2010, is now freely available in Demo
  Version through email request at the foundry typographies.fr.\r\n\r\nIt is with
  a limited character set and only for non-commercial use, but we hope it will answer
  the testing needs of publishers and graphic designers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, for the
  hundredth request, instead of a Demo Version, we will send a Pro Version as a gift.\r\n\r\nYours
  sincerely.\r\n\r\n"
