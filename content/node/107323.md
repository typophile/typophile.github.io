  for the quality of the picture. It's a screen cap from the elevator scene in Ghostbusters:

  yet to get a reply. Perhaps the crack team here at <em>Typophile</em> can help me
  out :)"

    doesn't appear to be any \"bona fide\" typeface that I'm aware of, so I'm inclined
    to go along with your theory that it was hand painted, and because it looks like
    a ransom note - no two letters the same! Plus, the fact that appears in the background
    of a movie makes me think it was probably quickly knocked out by one of the back
    room boys in the \"props department\". Hey - who knows, it may have been in hundreds
    of films and never been spotted before - but now it's a true star!\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    if you were looking for a digital typeface similar to this, then I would be tempted
    to go with Bookman Italic Swash as a starting point. It just a thought, as that's
    what it reminded me of when I first saw it - unless anyone else has any other
    suggestions?\r\nhttp://marketplace.veer.com/font/Bookman-Italic-Set-JBT0000087\r\n\r\nBTW
    - does anyone actually smoke anymore?"
