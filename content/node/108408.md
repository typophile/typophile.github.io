  guys can help me with this one? I am struggling to identify a typeface which has
  been used throughout the branding of a company I am currently redesigning.\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface is used predominantly in the logo, hopefully when its identified I will
  be able to see if its commercially available as a web font to use online:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6734.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated, \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLewis.\r\n\r\n"
