    step. FontLab 4 also saves otf type but its generation provides not the full features
    of the current adobe fdk build. <BR> <BR>Why you want convert type one fonts to
    otf? Do you developing any fonts? I mean If you don`t developing any fonts - the
    only advantage of an otf font is &#40;only with correct conversation&#41; you
    can use it on every computer system / application what provides otf support. Not
    much at the moment - think InDesign 2.0 is the only one with an acceptable support. '

  body: ' Another advantage is power: OT fonts can have fancy features like automatic
    ligation, and this type of thing actually enables the elegant typesetting of many
    non-Latin languages. <BR> <BR>A third advantage &#40;the main reason for the existence
    of OT?&#41; is that you can charge more for it, even if you used to sell a non-OT
    version... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' exactly hrant,  <BR> <BR>and that`s why I have asked if he develops some
    fonts. Think a raw conversation of an existing type one font gives no benefit.
    So if you made an otf font - use the possibilities. But developing / testing of
    the feature code data is &#34;something up form the road&#34; of a today&#39;s
    type designers work flow. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>If a otf font have more benefit - its
    ok to charge more - most of the Adobe pro fonts including more than four standard
    type one fonts in one otf build. <BR> <BR>The &#34;power&#34;... him, maybe in
    the future - for now also InDesign 2.0 have no full access to the current otf
    specifications. <BR> <BR>In most applications also the kern feature of an otf
    type is ignored - so a type one font is more usable. '

  body: Hrant, I think you are being oversimplistic with the OT cost issue. Yes, I
    am sure <I>some</I> will use it as an excuse to inflate prices, but there are
    others who will use the technology to further typographic design rather than further
    their own selfish ends.  <BR> <BR>No doubt it will be left to the indys to lead
    the way - take Jeremey Tankard&#39;s new Aspect family as a prime example of using
    OT innovatively, and without apparent price inflation. <BR> <BR>Dont condemn an
    entire technology, condemn companies that misuse that technology. For example,
    Thomas Phinney of Adobe, speaking at TypeCon2002, did little to reassure people
    &#40;well, me&#41; that it was nothing more than an excuse for his department
    to milk a &#40;designer&#41; cash cow. LAck of upgrade options were squirmed around
    in a way that made me feel decidedly uncomfortable, not only for the transparent
    spin but also the technological innaccuracies. <BR> <BR>I am sure that many of
    the larger, more &#34;serious&#34; families created by Adobe <I>will</I> make
    reasonable use of the technology, but I doubt that converting the entire library
    over to OT by the end of the Autumn will herald a new era in typography. <BR>
    <BR>Concentrate your efforts on those that deserve it, Hrant <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: ' I agree with your sentiments, David. It&#39;s not the technology, it&#39;s
    who uses it and for what. <BR> <BR>Regarding Adobe, however, I think the form
    of their greed may be slightly different than you imply. I believe the primary
    motivation for converting the entire library to OTF is to actively court Microsoft&#39;s
    corporate Windows market. OTF is cross-platform compatible, so big companies should
    no longer be afraid to buy lots of fonts. &#40;And while they&#39;re at it, they
    can buy copies of PageMaker for all their employees, and then they won&#39;t need
    to hire designers anymore.&#41; '

  body: ' David, you have a point, but I &#42;love&#42; OT - I&#39;m not in the least
    condemning it. Heck, Adobe might even be excused for their &#34;cleverness&#34;
    considering the poor state of the font market. <BR> <BR>But business is business,
    and the reality is that the same identical font with no extra features &#40;in
    fact with a somewhat higher technological barrier!&#41; can sell for a bit more
    under the guise of OT. The same way that Toyota changes the bodywork on their
    Camry, calls it a Lexus something-or-other, and doubles the price; the same with
    Audi using VW &#34;essentials&#34;: the much-touted TT is just a really fancy
    Bug. Some people take advantage of this business reality, others have more scruples.
    <BR> <BR>In fact, historically font houses have always looked for &#40;and maybe
    even sometimes concocted, or at least helped concoct&#41; new formats to resell
    their core value &#40;sets of letterforms&#41; to a saturated market. Many of
    these fonts we&#39;re using have been around for hundreds of years, and we&#39;re
    constantly having to re-pay for them... It&#39;s the price of technology I guess
    - it has a life of its own, with a ravenous apetite that must be fed. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Adobe has a whole bunch of motivations for creating OpenType fonts. Trying
    to make disproportionately more money relative to the work that goes in or the
    value users get is not among those motives, though. <BR> <BR>I understand David
    Earls&#39; concern about upgrade issues. It&#39;s true that we don&#39;t have
    a great story there &#40;though Font Folio owners/buyers will be in good shape&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>That aside, we are working very hard to make our OpenType fonts highly
    worthwhile, both by making good fonts, and by helping the rest of Adobe develop
    applications that support them. In particular, the final set of &#34;converted&#34;
    fonts will include a lot of fonts that look a lot like &#34;Pro&#34; fonts in
    terms of typographic features, from having merged Expert and supplemental fonts.
    However, these are still considered &#34;Standard&#34; fonts by Adobe, as they
    have only the basic language support and lack the additional custom characters
    and fine tuning of Pro fonts. I think they will make a great value, and in general
    they are actually quite a bit cheaper than buying the separate Type 1 fonts would
    be. <BR> <BR>On top of that, there are the intro prices on each new set of OpenType
    fonts, at about 1/3 off the regular price. I don&#39;t see that as a grab for
    money on Adobe&#39;s part. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T '
