  use for their cover. It kinda reminds me of a (static-) egyptienne, but I am not
  too sure about that... \r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nJan"

    you are! You have read your [[Hans Peter Willberg|Willberg]] well \u2026 ;\xB0)
    According to his classification, Clarendons are a subgenre of the \u2018static
    egyptienne\u2019 \u2013 characteristics would be a distinct contrast of stroke
    widths; double-storey \u2018g\u2019, open \u2018a\u2019; \u2018a\u2019, \u2018g\u2019
    and \u2018r\u2019 with ball terminals; among others.\r\nOriginally, Clarendon
    is the English version of the slab-serif and it therefore occasionally is called
    \u2018Englische Egyptienne\u2019 in German. Emerging as early as in the 1820s,
    it has more \u2018human\u2019 forms than its continental counterparts.\r\n"
