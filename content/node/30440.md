body: "Can someone explain me if the overshoot / undershoot get's larger in heavier
  weights? I'm busy with a sans serif family and I'm wondering if i should have more
  overshoot / undershoot in the bold weights, proportional to the larger x-height.
  I checked with some other sans serif families but there seems no coherent logic.
  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n"

    don't touch it anymore. If it doesn't look good, change it until it does.\r\n\r\nArtur\r\n\r\n***********************************************\r\nnew
