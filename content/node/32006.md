  seeing a resurgence with this typeface everywhere i go. I swear. At least i think
  that's the one. Makes me think early to mid 90s for some reason."

    Blur</a> which is close, but not it. Nor is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=EF.6445.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=cyworld&sampleSize=48'>Frankfurter</a>

  body: "Thank you guys for all the feedback! I knew it wasn't VAG. I considered in
    the back of my head, that it could've been VAG with a modified filter applied
    to it in photoshop but wrote it off. I'd seen the font in too many other places
    to assume that it was a technique applied over and over again.\r\n\r\nActually
    it's probably either FF Blur medium or bold. That looks about right. Couldn't
    possibly be anything else right?"

    not. I believe there are a couple of fonts -- also non-released stuff from students
    --  from the grunge boom that are similar, and it could be one of them."

    though.\r\n\r\nKorean fonts include latin alphabet glyphs by default in addition
    to the hangul (Korean alphabet). It is pretty common, I imagine, for Korean designers
    to use the latin alphabet component of their Korean fonts for latin-alphabet logos."

  body: As for the Cyworld logo itself, though, I think it's pretty much settled that
    the font used is Gureum M. YoonDesign wouldn't display it as a prominent example
    of one of their fonts in use on the front page of their website if that wasn't
    the case.
