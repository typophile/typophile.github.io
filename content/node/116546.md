  something from you to best learn about what concepts it could serve best!\r\n\r\nThe
  link is here:\r\n[[https://www.behance.net/gallery/16887149/Next-Century-Typeface|NewCenturyTypeface]]\r\n\r\nI
  would like to know you opinion, even to maybe create a best apllication for it.
  I'm not a great type expert so I would like to learn more with you.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    a picture sample of it.
