body: "Each year, The Special Collections & Rare Books Department at [[Simon Fraser
  University]] (SFU) convenes a special book-related event. This year we are pleased
  to celebrate our good friend and one of [[Canada]]\u2019s living national treasures,
  the printer, typographer and publisher, [[Jim Rimmer]]. \r\n\r\nJim\u2019s career
  stretches back over fifty years and he has made many friends along the way, both
  at home and abroad: printers, type designers, publishers, students, teachers, design
  firms, binders, type founders, librarians, book collectors. . . Since many of these
  people are printers, we are inviting their participation in this public event by
  producing a broadside celebrating . . . Jim. The broadside may be any size and could
  include an anecdote or tribute, for example, and should include a signed colophon.
  We would like to have three copies of each broadside: two will be given to Jim;
  the third will reside in SFU\u2019s Special Collections Department, which holds
  Rimmer\u2019s archives. We will need all broadsides in hand by October 31, 2006.\r\n\r\nYou
  may also send personal greetings and best wishes by email, card, fax -- any form
  you choose. In which case, please send three copies by October 31, 2006.\r\n\r\nThe
  broadsides and greetings will be gathered then presented to Jim during the evening
  of the Rimmerfest, which will take place on 25 November at Simon Fraser University,
  515 West Hastings St., Vancouver at 7:30 p.m. Robert Bringhurst, among others, will
  speak at this celebratory event. All are welcome.\r\n\r\nThe broadsides and the
  greetings should be sent to\r\n \r\nEric L. Swanick, Special Collections Department
  \r\nSimon Fraser University \r\n8888 University Drive \r\nBurnaby, BC V5A 1S6\r\nCanada
  \r\nemail: eswanick@sfu.ca\r\ntel: 604 291 4626\r\nfax: 604 291 3023\r\n\r\nI look
  forward to receiving these special items and seeing you on 25 November. By the way,
  Typophiles should check out the Rimmer Type Foundry at http://www.p22.com/rtf/index.html\r\n\r\nThank
  you, \r\n\r\nEric Swanick\r\n"
