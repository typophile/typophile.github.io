  client at the moment and I've managed to find a suitable font which is FF Clan Pro
  for the system.\r\n\r\nFor the logotype I've managed to vector trace a snapshot
  of the font as a place holder but now I'm at the stage where I'm visualising all
  the applications and collaterals and it's tough not having the font. I really want
  to sell this font to the client so they can use it across all their communication,
  including touchscreen etc.\r\n\r\nHow does one go about visualising a project like
  this without the font \r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "You raise a good point.\r\nThe answer is it not always that easy.\r\n\r\n1.
    The best solution is that the budget is expansive enough to allow the purchase
    of font(s) in the development process.\r\n\r\n2. Another solution is to contact
    the foundry and secure the font on a trail basis. (some foundaries understandably
    won't do this).\r\n\r\n3. A third solution is to substitute a similar font in
    its place and sell the client a paper print out of the font style you want to
    use. This approach is often flawed as a lot of clients will say why am I having
    to pay or an extra font when the one you have used looks perfectly OK.\r\n\r\n4.
    My preferred solution is to factor in font purchases when I quote up front for
    the job, not giving the client the option. If you think about it, even if you
    were to use the fonts that come 'free' with, for example the Creative Suite, you
    have had to pay for them indirectly when you purchased the software. It makes
    business sense to pass on the cost of font licensing in the same way you would
    pass on the cost of laser prints, writing CD-R's etc etc...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I totally agree with belleisle... from my experience it's better to raise
    your fee to cover typeface purchases and factor it in when you work out the initial
    budget. \r\n\r\nOr else people do tend to question it and you end up being forced
    to limit your choices. As designers we don't have a lot of expenses once we have
    all the equipment \u2013 so treat it as you would treat anything else you outsource
    (photography, illustration...).\r\n\r\nIf there's no way you can raise the initial
    funds \u2013 consider billing half up front.\r\n\r\nBut in this case you can only
    really either just go for it and get back the cost in your bill, or try and see
    if the foundry will let you have a trial version.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://vllg.com\">Village</a>
    also do a thing where if you purchase one weight (pretty affordable) you can go
    back and purchase the family at the discount package price. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/StagSans\">Stag

  body: Yeah I was wondering about it and one solution is to factor in the cost of
    fonts upfront or invest on the font and if they buy the look I can bill them the
    cost. I'm trying to make it a point to educate clients on the strategic importance
    using unique fonts rather just using overused/general fonts cause it's free(most
    of the time they think it is anyway)

  body: "I suppose the question would be, what are you being paid for this identity
    design. If you are doing it on the cheap then the $314.00 for FF Clan Pro may
    be a budget buster, but if you are charging industry rates, than a $314.00 investment
    to license the fonts so you can put forth a strong proposal seems like a small
    price to pay.\r\n\r\nAnd what happens when your client accepts your font proposal.
    Most likely they are going to have to invest in a substantial company-wide license
    to utilize the fonts in your identity program. No?\r\n\r\nJames"
