body: has anyone used this plugin for InDesign? Is there a reason it hasn't been updated
  so as to work with InD CS(2)? It seems like it'd be handy, especially when wanting
  to see how [[kern|kerning]] looks with [[OpenType|OT]] features applied. Or is there
  another way to do this? Any advice is appreciated.

  body: "I looked into the docs. Its modifing an \"adobe opentype developer kit\"
    like kerning file. All the classes have to pre defined in it. For me it was not
    very usefull. But the second plugin \"ApplyOpenType\" was it, since it can activate
    every feature.\r\n\r\n-- from the docs --\r\nThis plug-in is not intended to create
    the kerning data for an OpenType font but can be used to greatly accelerate and
    facilitate the fine-tuning of kerning data.\r\n\r\nNote that EditOTFMetrics can
    only open feature files that contain kerning data, not complete feature files.
    This kerning data file must contain all the kern class definitions and positioning
    statements. It can contain no other feature file expressions.\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"specially
    when wanting to see how kerning looks with OT features applied\" \r\n\r\nThe kerning
    is active in InDesign anyway. Of course your special & altnerative glyphs have
    to be in a kerning class or their own kernings.\r\n\r\nSince I made all my opentypes
    with this adobe tool, I write all my kernings by hand with an text editor. If
    you have your standard glyph database you can pre define your kerning classes
    and most things of the feature code.\r\n\r\nBTW. Hopefully Mr. Phinney will say
    something about the next release of the Adobe OpenType Dev Kit and these plugins.\r\n\r\n--<a
