    it's a drawback) this is totally amazing!

  body: "Whoa! Another fantastic effort!\r\nDecorative N might be mistaken for H.
    I think the inner twirl on decorative W needs the stress the other way. \r\nI'd
    do the RO and OS as ligatures as those tails on R and S are designed around the
    O, and won't work so well next to other glyphs.\r\nI'm really liking this! KUTGW!

  body: "It's beautiful if pretty hard to read. Is it supposed to be \"arhaic\" or
    \"archaic\"?\r\n\r\nI think I'd tweak a few elements for readability (sorry I'm
    a usability guy :-) ) -- e.g. the M has structural elements that are disguised
    as decoration which make it hard to parse. The A containing both a lowercase and
    uppercase A is very playful ... I wonder if this might not be something that one
    could tease out into an entire font (perhaps having almost identical upper and
    lowercase elements which simply de-emphasize some elements in a given glyph)."

  body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nFirst of all thank you very much for all your comments.
    Great input for me.\r\n\r\n@Bendy, I will try to adjust the letters (N and W),
    ligatures would be great indeed, thank you for mentioning the other fonts I am
    working on.\r\n\r\n@podperson, I know it's hard to read but it's just a decorative
    font meant for titles and just a couple of words. The name \"arhaic\" is the Romanian
    equivalent to the English word \"archaic\". I thought I write Romanian words because
    it's based on old Romanian letters and it will probably used mainly for Romanian.
    I will adjust the M. I was also stroke by the lowercase a there, but didn't thought
    about creating a font using that solution. This is a great idea, thank you. I
    hope to see other font using it (@eliason), here on Typophile.\r\n\r\n@riccard0,
    yes you are right, it resembles Vyaz font and that's because they both share the
    same origin. There was a time when religious books in Romania were written using
    Slavonic language and some time later only the Cyrillic letters were used. Romanian
    language is a latin one and uses latin letters so there was only a period in time
    that the Romanian Orthodox Church used it. I was thinking of reviving them although
    they are hard to use. Only traditional, religious Romanian texts would be appropriate,
    but anyway I thought they should be brought to present day and computer use. So,
    yes it's a sort of a \"nephew\" of Vyaz. :)\r\n\r\n@alexfjeldall, more extreme
    decorative would be fun so I think I will do it. For now, the letters presented
    here are some of the variants I did and you can see them all on my blog (text
    is in Romanian but images speak for themselves) LInk:\r\nhttp://florinf.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/arhaic-romanesc-ornamental/\r\nUndecorated
    would also be nice to do, so I think there would be a large family for this one.\r\n\r\nThank
    you all.\r\n\r\nFlorin"

  body: "This one could be a really interesting type if you think of the wide range
    of combinations of ligatures possible.\r\n1.The book says at its very beginning:
    VIATA and that shows the ligature v_i \r\nI would re-design V and W because for
    example they would not work by A. The ball terminal of them are actually from
    the I (of viata).\r\n\r\n2. Try to compense it optically: The R and K of Simple
    variable, need to have a bit longer tail. Remember the -curve rule- of designing
    a type. (Circles always need to be bigger than squares to look the same size).
    Also look at the bottom of the S, it looks smaller than the T because of that.
    The serif of T is straight, the base of S curved. So, S must break the baseline
    a little bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is awesome when a type gives this possibilitie of
    playing with lots of alternate forms.\r\nDo not surrender  , I like your project.
    Test how it writes, and upload new samples!\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/msproviero|Li\xE1n

  body: The circles on all the swirls (g, h, j, k) are all different sizes, it would
    look better if they were all the same size. In all retrospect it is a beautiful
    font!
