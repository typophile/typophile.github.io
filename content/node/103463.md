  with all its beautiful kerns and ligatures on a poster.  It is the perfect font
  for the theme.  Only one problem, I can not figure out a way for an \"s\" to precede
  an \"a\".  I have not seen that combination in any of the alternatives created nor
  seen an S before an a in print.  Any thoughts?"

  body: "It depends on what comes after the /A/\u2026 If I remember correctly there
    are 3 shapes for the A - a symmetrical on (more or less what is usual in a sans)
    and two a-symmetricals, one with a straight vertical on the left and one with
    a vertical on the right side. So, of there is a /T/ after the /A/, I would the
    'left straight' /A/ and track the /T/. But with an /S/ for instance, I would use
    the classic /A/. You get the drift, I hope."
