  body: Linofilm fonts would have been produced by Mergenthaler Linotype. It was the
    generation of film phototypesetting machines just prior to the V-I-P. I don't
    know what the "2NFA" refers to.

      body: "It was indeed, something I learned after I wrote the first post. I went
        back in to edit it and discovered my Internet was down. It just now came back
        up, hours later!\r\n\r\nAnyway, not only did they make the 2NFA, they also
        made Linotype machines and had the ability to cut matrices for the machines
        so it is entirely possible they had the means to make film fonts for the 2NFA
        as well as the Linofilm."
