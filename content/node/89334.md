  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'm asking for too much here, but I'm looking for a serif
  font with a full set of numerals (old style figures, proportional lining figures,
  tabular lining figures) and I would also like the old style figures to have a slightly
  higher x-height than the non-numerals. \r\n\r\nI find true old style figures hard
  to use especially when you need to set it together with text (such as US$120,000).
  I never really know what to do as uppercase looks too large and small caps for US$
  look too small. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions / recommendations / links about old style
  numerals are welcome. Thanks!"

    (\"hybrid\" figures) is what's going to narrow it down quite a bit...\r\n\r\nYou
    might check out Ernestine*. Nina has done a killer job\r\nwith the numerals, and
    has two sizes of smallcaps to boot.\r\n\r\n* http://ernestinefont.com/features/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the link Riccardo. \r\n\r\nHey Hrant! Yes, it's been a while.
    And I'm kinda out of touch. \r\nI even forgot that they were called \"hybrid\"
    figures.\r\nThat Ernestine is a beautiful one. I'll be sure to look at it in greater
    detail.\r\nBut what a g!\r\n\r\nHey Jurgen, thanks for that. But I was hoping
    for something along the lines of HFJ's Mercury or Chronicle, both of which do
    not come with OSF, according to the website.\r\n\r\nI like text faces that still
    look good at display sizes.\r\nAdd that to the requirements for numerals, and
    I've got a very very tall order, I know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Karen, my [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams
    Caslon Text]] has a full set of figures, and the old style \"x-height\" is higher
    than the lower case x-height. You can find some examples [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/ot/|here]],
    and more on the PDF linked at the bottom of the page. As well as the four styles,
    old style and lining, both proportional and fixed width, there are superiors,
    inferiors, and lining figures at small caps sizes. These later, which are a bit
    unusual, I find quite useful, and they may be what you are looking for. \r\n\r\nThis
    is, as the name indicates, intended for text sizes. The bold and the italics work
    for headings say at 14pt, but the heading sizes are yet to come...\r\n\r\nFor
    true display sizes you can match with Big Caslon, Caslon 540, and the new award
    winning [[http://letter2.org/winner/william|William.]], though I'm not sure where
    to get that latter one, which is pretty impressive.  "
