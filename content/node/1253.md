  it was rather inocuous...to me, apollo = exploration, 26 = alphabet... but a fellow
  type designer who works with T26 today said in an email that Apollo 26 was kinda
  uncool, in his opinion. I wrote to CS at T26 and he expressed his thoughts in a
  very direct pleasant manner. <BR> <BR> <BR>So...Anyone have any thoughts about the
  number 26? <BR> <BR>would apollo 26 create confusion in the marketplace among type
  buyers? <BR> <BR>then there&#39;s the Apollo Program, elliott earls. <BR> <BR>Arggh!
  Anyone have any lucid thoughts? <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: ' BJ, you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head - both of those names have &#34;industry
    saturation&#34; in that they both have associations with other foundries. <BR>
    <BR>To that end, going with that name will decrease your &#34;uniqueness&#34;
    to the marketplace, especially if you&#39;re trying to build your own unique brand.
    <BR> <BR>Focus on what it is you want to accomplish with your foundry, print out
    one line showings of all the fonts you&#39;ve created for commercial sale and
    look at what you&#39;ve got. <BR> <BR>In short order, it should become obvious
    what it is you&#39;re really going as a foundry. From there, it&#39;s a matter
    of finding a name that compliments that vision and brings it to another level.
    <BR> <BR>Also, make the name memorable and easy to remember because one day a
    few years from today, when somebody mentions your foundry by its contacted name,
    everybody who reads about it will know exactly what foundry is being referred
    to. <BR> <BR>&#40;eg: House, Emigre, Font Diner, you get the pocture&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Whereas if somebody posts, check out the new Apollo fonts, or the new 26 fonts,
    chances are they won&#39;t know it was referring to you. . . <BR> <BR>Just my
    thoughts . . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' BJ: I concur totally with what Stuart said, and I think you should wipe
    the slate clean and rename.  <BR>In naming a font - which I think is a discussion
    we had here already - it is preferable if the name is evocative. But naming a
    font/design company I think all bets are off. You don&#39;t have to be literal
    and you might get away with anything. Look at Yahoo!, eBay, Frog, etc. etc. Printing
    out the one line examples could help, but the stuff between the lines - the business
    plan inside your head might be the clarifying factor in gelling/choosing a name. '

    the pont of industry saturation, it&#39;d be like calling yourself &#39;Test Pilot

    the name &#39;Apollo 26&#39; it&#39;s a fine name, it unforunatly lends itself
    to other rather well known companies within this industry and could easily force
    comparisons if not animosity from one of the owners who may see it as &#39;borrowing&#39;
    their identity. <BR> <BR>If there are names out there that you would be just as

  body: ' Of all the Greek gods, I&#39;d have to say Apollo would be my last choice
    as a representative for the creative process in general and the typographic arts
    in particular &#40;even though he&#39;s oft depicted as the God of Arts&#41;.
    Sure, he&#39;s more than qualified to act as poster god for the Art of Hinting,
    along with his sister Artemis, but this is only one aspect of the process. &#40;In
    a similar vein, the 26 letters are only a small sampling of the typographic realm.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Imo, as far as greek gods are concerned, some kind of partnership between
    Hephaistos, Dionysus and Hermes would be a good team. From a practical matter,
    as far as the general public is concerned anyway, you may as well name your foundry
    Three Stooges, Inc. If you had to pick just one, the Roman analogue to Dionysus,
    &#42;Bacchus&#42;, might make for a cool logohead... Just a thought. <BR> <BR>-

  body: ' Thanks again Stuart and Mart, Sean John and Andy?. I know this is kind of
    a silly discussion, blah, blah, pixels for words. But instead of regretting a
    hasty post, I&#39;ll try to embrace it. So... <BR>We have our first retail release
    coming later this month, DEFCON, a preview of which will be available late Wednesday.
    Certainly, I&#39;d like to do the &#42;right&#42; thing, but...I have a partner
    who has an opinion, CS has an opinion, probably EE has an opinion, and what is
    &#42;right&#42;? And how does &#42;that&#42; differ from what is pragmatic? <BR>
    <BR>Looking back at my computer files, the first record of Apollo 26 is from last
    November. So it&#39;s almost been Nine Months. Hmmm. In nine months, my partner
    and I have taken on the identity of the name and our work reflects it. We &#42;are&#42;
    the name and the name &#42;is&#42; us. To us it means exploration, creative freedom,
    no mo status quo. It&#39;s difficult to quantify or qualify, but to us, it&#39;s
    &#42;deep&#42; and &#42;real&#42;. Also, last November, EE was pretty much dormant
    in the industry. So when the name popped into my head, it wasn&#39;t a synthesis
    of EE or CS or any of that. <BR> <BR>Initially, Apollo 26 was going to be an online
    magazine to fan my burning passions for type and letterforms, with 26 handy issues,
    one every two weeks, a mix of design and journalism. I had the themes plotted
    out, the interview lists ready...hey Stuart, you were going to be featured in
    the RETRO-themed issue. The &#39;26&#39; worked three different ways -- the alphabet,
    the bi-weekly issues, and Apollo 13X2. <BR> <BR>The Apollo 13 mission has personal
    significance to me, besides being a great moment in &#42;thinking&#42;, it coincided
    with an important event in my life without which I wouldn&#39;t be here: birth.
    <BR> <BR>On general principle, to me, the number 26 is fair game but A26 is too
    close. &#39;26&#39; as a number to describe the alphabet &#40;Alphabet 26&#41;
    or type or fonts is not &#39;wholly original&#39; to T26, not like Test Pilot
    Collective is wholly original. And Sean gave us a concise history of Apollo. I
    can see how people &#39;in&#39; the industry would get flustered by the name,
    irritated, or just plain roll their eyes. True, as a &#39;practical business matter&#39;,
    the name should be changed but sometimes principle is stronger than practical.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the input, <BR> <BR>Get ready for a sneak peek at DEFCON,
    the first retail release from... <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '

    &#34;Apollo 26,&#34; which would dovetail nicely with your corporate name, the

    T26 and P22 just a teensy bit samey in the name department, but they seem to co-exist
    just fine and dandy. They seem far closer in my opinion than T26 and Apollo26.
    <BR> <BR>Far more of a worry is Apollo26 vs the Apollo Program - did you try and
    get in touch with the other Mr Earls for his opinion? <BR> <BR>All that said,
    I am sort of with Stuart on this one; if there are similarities with other brands
    out there, you risk &#40;without wanting to sound like some prat in a suit at
    Wolff Olins&#41; diluting your brand. That does no-one any favours. '
