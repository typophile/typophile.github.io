    your Spiral O in .gif form: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56875.gif"
    alt="Spiral O"> <BR> <BR>I have to ask if you have any other letters? The reason
    is because we have been getting game players who ask for single letters to be
    ID&#39;d to help them win a game. Most of us would rather not be used to help
    someone cheat at something they should do on their own.'
