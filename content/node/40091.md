body: "While discussing typography over dinner, my friend and I ended up talking about
  designers we knew. His impression where that most designers are arrogant, bitter
  and often very negative. Thinking through my own experiences, I realized I had crossed
  paths with quite a few visual artists fitting that description as well. \r\n\r\nNow,
  I truly hope this is not the case. I feel most typophiles are very humble and helpful
  in dialog with youngsters & newbies, like myself. \r\n\r\nWhat's your impression?"

    get in positions where they "know better" than whom ever they meet. I hope not
    to become a patronizing old man with all the answers.

  body: "I think we operate in environments where lots of people have opinions about
    design (informed and uninformed) so iIt's natural for a designer to weigh in heavily
    at times. I have seen the developers here get in more heated debate than the designers
    at times. In development and design there are right and wrong ways to do things,
    and huge grey subjective areas in the middle.\r\n\r\nBut, just don't confuse strong
    opinions with cockiness. If people think you're cocky it's because you're delivering
    your opinions wrong.\r\n\r\nIn my experience the only people that fit the description
    you gave are when kids are right out of school and have the \"right\" talent and
    get into \"right\" job. These traits (arrogance, etc.) don't serve them very well
    in the real world and they learn. You can imagine the same thing happening with
    bright medical students or engineering students who excel and get great positions.
    \r\n\r\nI've only ever met one seasoned designer who was actually a true jerk.
    I admired this guy for years (and bought his books) but meeting him in person
    was a disappointment. Like I said, though, that's been a major exception. \r\n\r\n(Oh,
