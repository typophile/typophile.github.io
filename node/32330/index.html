  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Just wanted to waste some time and was wondering what got all of you started with typography and or Graphic Design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a doodler but never pursued art in my education. I studied Journalism and Communication at the University of Arizona and was fed up with life. It came down to some unknown calling to do one of the following. Join the Army (almost signed my life away) or find an art school. Can&rsquo;t say why I wanted to, I didn&rsquo;t have the foggiest idea about typography or design. Yet I found myself moving back to the Bay Area and pursuing just that. Still to this day don&rsquo;t know what made me want to do it, but now I can officially call myself a Typophile (amonsgt other things . . . not ending in &lsquo;phile&rsquo; though).</p>
<p>I love to hate it, im almost done with this degree but I have never felt further away from  the end goal. But I am grateful for Typophile as I can now rant, rave, and post about stuff not to many other people notice or care about.</p>
<p>Anyway I would love to hear how everyone else delved into this realm of passion and pain. . .</p>
<p>Cheers (Slainte)</p>

But where I grew up encouraging kids to do anything creative with their lives was verboten, so I ended up working in IT until I was 25, at which point I quit my job and went to art school hoping to study digital illustration and 3D animation. Neither of those went anywhere, but I was really digging page layout, and once I&rsquo;d had a really great typography class I was hooked.</p>

I think what prompted me to pursue typography in a serious way was printing letterpress books and setting the type by hand. The process, from beginning to end, from setting the type to printing the words, is, well, kind of magic. At some point in the process the shapes of the letters suddenly took on great importance and I asked myself why - why do the letters look the way they do and how is it that these little pieces of lead in printed form can look so very beautiful on the printed page. I knew somehow that Spectrum, Romulus, Romanee, Joanna, Gill Sans, Goudy Thirty were great designs but I&rsquo;m still asking myself the question why. The more you look at the letters and their structure the more you come to understand the wonder of it all, the 26 letters. It&rsquo;s Magic man!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I was 14, I started working on the layout team of a Boy Scout newsletter. I don&rsquo;t think that there was that much that was special about our design or layouts, but through the right active leaders, we got to use high-end pre-press tools that we probably never should have gotten our hands on…</p>
<p>Well, that got me hooked on the Mac, PageMaker, Photoshop, and eventually, Quark. I started developing black and white photos, and then figured that I should go to art school and study graphic design. This was actually a bit of a leap if you were to see the stuff I was trying (poorly) to do in high school, but I ended up at RISD and that was great.</p>
<p>I moved to Germany at the end of college, because I (naïvely?) thought that I would be moving somewhere whose culture was more typographically sophisticated than the United States of America&rsquo;s. I saw old letters everywhere, and knew that I could not be happy unless I began drawing type.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never too old. I went to university for the first time at age 47, and got my degree a week before turning 50. (I&rsquo;m still there, doing a masters now.)</p>
<p>As to the original question, my early love was journalism until I learned that it wasn&rsquo;t reporting that I liked, but the design of the pages. I never really was able to change that into a full time design career, with the exception of a few years doing textbooks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I got into typography in highschool. I am only 19 now, so that really wasn&rsquo;t long ago. But I was doing ok at school but nothing was taking my interest, then i studied visual communications and studio design in year 10, 11 and 12 (last 3 years of high school in Australia)&hellip;and immediately loved it. Typography didn&rsquo;t spring up though until i went along to a design conference in Melbourne (AGIDEAS) and listened to Ahn Sang Soo and David Pidgeon give their presentations. From that point on I have loved typography, this inspired me to design some basic typefaces of my own in my last year of high school and now studying Communication Design at uni, which has a strong emphasis on typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I remember exactly. I was taking a course in letterpress/bookmaking and was scouring the libraries for whatever I could find on typography. I couldn&rsquo;t find the clue. One day I opened a book of Poe&rsquo;s designed by Vojtech Preissig and saw his Preissig Antiqua. Then I understood (not saying I&rsquo;m any good at it mind you).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been teaching for some long time now and I still think epiphany is the desired state.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m with Don. I started out in journalism and realized I didn&rsquo;t enjoy writing so much as the printed page. Also I worked like a dog and got paid nothing while those union typesetters and printers did eight hours a day and got paid well, too!</p>
<p>My first professional typesetting job was at the Ohio University Post, typing into an IBM selectric typewriter with a 9&quot; metal tape cassette that could then be transferred to an &ldquo;output&rdquo; IBM selectric typewriter to set the type in justified columns on clay-backed paper for paste-up. I was hooked.</p>
