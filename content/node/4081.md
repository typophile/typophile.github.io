    now I think I was wrong. Well, at least I was 1 for 3 today.

  body: ' Thanks for the help -- it does appear to be Clarendon, all except for the
    O. Maybe the artist took the liberties of introducing a custom counter for the
    O? Any other guesses would be much appreciated. Otherwise, I can redraw the counter
    and call it good. Thanks again. '

  body: ' The reason I rescinded my Clarendon idea is that there&#39;s no weight or
    make of Clarendon I could find online that has a V with such a heavy thick part.
    It may be that the artist started with Clarendon and then redrew all the letters
    to suit his fancy. '

  body: ' What might have made Dave think of Clarendon is that the letters that Indiana
    used might have been taken from outlines or patterns designed for smaller sizes.
    Make any typeface with bracketed serifs large enough and it takes on a Clarendon
    appearance, in a sense. That&#39;s one reason display faces are necessary.  <BR>
    <BR>To me, big Clarendons usually look good. The letters in this &#39;LOVE&#39;
    sculpture don&#39;t look good. '

  body: ' I really liked the statue until just now.  <BR>always thought there was
    some motive for the tilted O. But look! its tilted simply so that width of the
    statue is uniform it seems <BR> <BR>If he didn&#39;t use a serifed font he could
    have had better balance. hmm. '
