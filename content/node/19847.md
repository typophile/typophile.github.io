  Some might classify them as geometric. They seem more grotesque to me. \r\n\r\nA
  difinitive answer would help me with a discussion. Thanks."

    I've been wondering recently how to categorise DIN which isn't square like Eurostile
    and Bank Gothic which I put away as \"squared sans\". \r\n\r\nNew type designs
    are continually filling up the gaps between categories so it's often impossible
    or impractical to place it in one category I think.\r\n\r\nStraight-sided grotesque!"

  body: "There's another sans genre that deserves its own name as well, the <em>Spiekersans</em>.
    These are structurally humanist, but simplified and regularized so that they are
    somewhere between humanist and grotesque or straight-sided. I think of Spiekermann's
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=FF%20Meta\">FF
    Meta</a> as the genesis of this category with his <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Unit\">FF

    about it actually, what is the difference between Grotesque and Neo Grotesque?
    Franklin Gothic-esque vs Helvetica-esque? I guess I could say my problem is that
    I see the difference in a histortical context. For example, the earlier english/american
    grotesques with the binocular g and the usually higher stroke modulation vs the
    newer german grotesques with the monocular g and the usually monoline strokes.\r\n\r\nSorry

  body: Hmm, I think the category 'Neo-Grotesque' is taken, and is reserved for the
    post-WWII 'new and improved' grotesques, like Univers, Helvetica, Folio, Unica,
    Video, etc. I also think that the condensed versions of many grotesques have straight-sided
    ovals (e.g., Akzidenz-Grotesk), and that cannot put them in a different classification
    category from the regular versions of the same typefaces. In my opinion, DIN and
    Conduit could be pretty safely classified as Grotesques... The same applies to
    the <em>Spiekersans's</em>, despite their being, well, slightly humanized.

    squared round or rouded square sans though is different enough from the other
    Neo-Grots that you listed to merit a new category, I think."

    friends wouldn't be considered humanist? I can't see how they could be grotesque.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I am at it, where would a font like EF Radiant or EF Praxis fall?"

    see how they could be grotesque.</cite>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, <em>proportions</em>,
    which are the primary classifiable features, of 'Meta & Friends' place them firmly
    in the Grotesque Sans category. Those are the 'Modern' (Didone) proportions: slightly
    narrowed (round shapes based on oval, not on circle), more uniform glyph widths.
    However, the <em>open counters</em> for shapes like C, G, S, a, c, e, and s are
    definitely 'Old-Style', and that\u2014secondary classifyiable\u2014feature relegates
    them to the Humanist Sans category (which also includes Gill Sans, Frutiger, Eras,
    Flora, Verdana, etc.). That is why I think that the <em>Spiekersans\u2019s</em>
    are actually Grotesques, albeit slightly humanized."
