body: "Hello, my fellow typophiles. \r\n\r\nI would like to invite you guys to have
  your say on a new rebranding.  \r\n\r\nA couple of days, I happened to stumble upon
  the rebranding news about Beijing Television,  the capital city television station
  in China. Shown below is the new logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/btv_3628.gif]\r\nWhen
  I saw the English wordmark at first sight, it seems sort of bad to me, though much
  better than it used to be just before the redesign, shown as follows (the old wordmark
  is OK, but too banal.):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/btvold_4944.jpg]\r\nTalking
  about the new logo, personally, I think the little serif is not a good typeface
  choice. The typeface seems to be slightly modified Copperlate Gothic Std. And even
  worse, there is a customized, homemade ligature between T and V. It bonds TV together,
  but disconnects B from the whole wordmark. \r\n\r\nHere is what the BTV says about
  its new logo in a press release:\r\n\r\n\"...the new logo consists of acronym of
  Beijing Television as major design elements. Clear, minimalistic, it conveys a more
  modern and international look. In color palette are red color of the forbidden city
  wall and white of Han white jades. The two colors are solemn, modern and international,
  blend seamlessly with the television station.\" Really, blurbs. \r\n\r\nAnd the
  new logo looks like this at BTV's website:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/btvontheweb_5837.png]\r\nWell,
  what do you think this new logo (especially the typography)? If it needs a third
  rebranding, what typefaces would you like to pick? :)\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nJames
  Zhou\r\n"

    as you rightly pointed out. Comment: Yuck!\r\n\r\nBut then Chinese design in English
    has always been quite bad, you cannot expect better."

  body: "@hashimpm\r\n\r\nThe logo typeface is indeed Friz Quadrata.:) Gotham fits
    well, but I'm afraid it's sort of overused.\r\n\r\nAnd I agreed with you. English
    typography in China is really bad and even disastrous. For most of them Chinese
    designers, what they know only are Arial or Times New Roman. When it comes to
    corporate design (graphic marks aside, mostly involving juxtaposition or mashup
    of Chinese and English typefaces. It\u2019s bilingual as the say), designers usually
    take whatever available at their hands, never giving typography a second thought.
    In most cases, they use free fonts circulated on the web. Or better, Adobe Font
    Folio is a choice. But whatever they use in typography, the finished works end
    up as ugly ducks due to a fundamental paucity of typographic knowledge. English
    typography in China is like an isolated world where designers just use what they
    like, without caring about what goes on with current typography. (A reasonable
    excuse is that they balk at English, they need translation)\r\n\r\nA brutal fact
    is: Chinese designers, regardless of veteran or newbie, love doing what is called
    typefaces transformation or distortion (NOT modifying merely glyphs). It\u2019s
    so popular that every designer like to show his/her tricks for the \u201Cmagical\u201D
    transformation. But what they do to typefaces seems typographic tortures to me.
    Quite sadly and embarrassingly, they also boast their works on graphic design
    forums. \r\n\r\nUnlike type foundries here in the US, Germany, France and other
    countries, Chinese type foundries have been wilting and get submerged by the massive
    overflows of fonts available on the web. Basically, China has a long history of
    calligraphy, but it lacks a good culture of typography (By and large, type foundries
    is just after pure profits, not the pure typography, to some extent, the typography
    is contaminated with commercial profitability). Everyone can be type designs,
    then where does the font value lies in? Even ridiculously, a famous Chinese type
    foundry successfully digitized a director\u2019s handwritten scripts. The new
    \u201Ccharacteristic\u201D typeface was named after the director and became a
    smash hit on the web. By the way, this director knows nothing about neither typography
    nor calligraphy, she just have a pair of beautiful hands which impart good-looking
    scripts. There is an old news: Akira Kobayashi was once invited to be as a judge
    at the Chinese Type Design Contest (I really appreciate Akira's works) . When
    I read the news, part of me was lost... \r\n\r\nFinally, I don't know when Chinese
    type designers can wake up to the real type design and typography and learn about
    it. "

    one you show. The joining of TV makes sense to me, since the abbreviation stands
    for Beijing TeleVision. \r\n\r\nI do, however, join in the hate of the Copperplate
    tagline."

  body: "@eliason\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your thoughts.:) The smallcap Copperplate
    words are really like a typographic error.  I also like boxed or framed logo,
    say, National Geographic and Design within Reach. It make parts of a logo as a
    whole. By the way, the words in Copperplate are not real tagline or slogan, it's
    just another redundant short description, pretty lacklustre. "

    the cultural issues it could have been much worse.\r\n\r\nThe real flaw is the
    color: saturated reds pixelate in most digital video compression schemes. But
    a different color might get the designers imprisoned so I guess it\u2019s understandable. "

  body: "@J.P.\r\n\r\nNice remarks. BTV launched the new logo on New Year's Day. And
    the public marketing campaigns already wrapped up. So far, I still don't know
    which studio did that job (Probably a local branding agency made it). For most
    Chinese designers, any decent typeface is OK since they know quite little about
    it. BTV doesn't care if the typeface is way too 2002. \r\nAs for the color, red
    is a national color in China. People love it because read is about passion, luck,
    joy and happiness. So no wonder red is there. I'm still worried what the logo
    looks like on screen. "
