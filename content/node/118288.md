    to me you are correct that it was a custom job by Fletcher.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    pointing me towards that!"

    I think Alan Fletcher is a better bet:\r\nhttp://www.alanfletcherarchive.com/archive/corporate-identity\r\n\r\nI
    also cycled through dozens of Palatino-like faces, and found no good match, so
    I'm betting it is custom."
