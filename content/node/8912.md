  body: Patricia your link needs to be modified to work <BR><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/sonofthemask/"
    target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/sonofthemask/</a> <BR> <BR>I
    am not sure that is a commercially available font &#40;i.e. it may be custom&#41;,
    but it&#39;s a style you might find at <a href="http://www.fonthead.com" target="_blank">Fonthead
    Design</a>, or <a href="http://www.pizzadude.dk/home.php" target="_blank">PizzaDude</a>,
    or maybe <a href="http://www.fontdiner.com/main.html" target="_blank">FontDiner</a>.
    <BR> <BR>It looks like a modification/distortion of something really familiar,
    like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/lithos/black/testdrive.html?s=SON+OF+the+MASK&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Lithos</a>.

    it&#39;s closer to Cafeteria. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Stuart :D
