  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Is there any prospect that the »CE marking« symbol (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking) will ever be part – at least – of standard body face character sets? 
I need it very often, especially for corporate profiles, annual reports and brochures. I know that it hasn’t been encoded as a character. – However, this shouldn’t be an obstacle for type designers to add it.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you so much for this essential information, Karl! Nevertheless, the specified minimum vertical size is – as I learned now – 5mm, which means ca. 14 DTP points (hopefully I’m right). I think the set point size (as specified in vertical mm) should be user responsibility and not responsibility of the type designer, foundry or reseller. – Important is the availability of this character in the character set of a body face.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It doesn't look like it has a Unicode position, plus since it's so strictly defined that a font's style will have no bearing on it. So it's not very desirable as a character in a font. Why not just have/use it as a stand-alone EPS? It's not like you need to type a bunch of them at a time.

Additionally, there's a risk concerning that minimum size, possibly leading to a textbook frivolous lawsuit, which is how people roll these days, at least here in the US. If a font publisher says something like "it must be 14 point to meeting the 5mm minimum requirement" some people will think the font has to be set at 14 point, but as George said that's not true, because type designers don't make their glyphs span the full height, so the mark will end up too small, and the lawsuit cascade might lead to the font designer... And for a type designer with a large library of fonts, unless he does decide to make the CE mark the whole height of the Em for all his fonts, he'll have to figure out the height proportion for each one of his fonts... Messy stuff.

BTW is that thing spaced horribly, or what?! But if you try to make it look nicer by bringing the "C" and "E" closer, Interpol might come after you!

		<div class="commentbody">It should be encoded, and I'm surprised if it is not already in Unicode. Even though I don't think it is something that needs to be included in more than a handful of fonts, since the shape is standard, being able to include it as a text entitity rather than as an embedded graphic seems useful. The estimated symbol is also a standard shape, but is encoded in Unicode and hence included in at least some fonts.</div>
