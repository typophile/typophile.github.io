body: "Excerpt from GigaOm:\r\n\r\n\"On Friday, I heard Jonathan Hoefler, one of the
  founders of the massively respected type foundry Hoefler & Frere-Jones, explain
  exactly what it takes to turn a typeface designed for print into a real web font.
  And it was amazing.\r\n\r\nHe was appearing at Ampersand \u2014 a conference in
  Brighton, England, dedicated to the art of web fonts \u2014 where he stood on stage
  and announced that the studio has now converted 100 percent of its typefaces for
  use on the web.\r\n\r\nThe news was greeted with a sage nod by attendees, but in
  truth it should have been met with crazed whoops, wild cheers and yelps of astonishment
  \u2014 because it\u2019s really a task of herculean proportions.\"\r\n\r\nFull article

    round of applause and whoops! Jonathan had already demonstrated the amount of
    work refining outlines and putting in some crazy 9 million (?) hints. It really
    made it clear to me that type designers are working incredibly hard in a dramatically
    expanding industry with groundbreaking technologies to create new possibilities
    for a new era of web typography. To echo the words of so many others at the conference,
    it''s an incredibly exciting time to be a designer.'

    was talking about a typeface really being an abstract idea that is realised in
    different technologies by different 'design systems'...in that model the screen
    version is not trying to mimic the print version, but remain true to the underlying
    concept, just using a different design system.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I totally
    understand the need to be driven by pixels (or sub-pixels). The question Hoefler
    asked was whether the screen font was still Gotham, and I guess the answer is
    as long as it looks more like Gotham than print-Gotham does on screen, it's a
    successful design system."

  body: "But we're talking about a pixel-size-<strong>de</strong>pendent angle, meaning
    a slant of atan(1/n) where n is an integer greater than 1. In Patria for example
    n is 16, so the angle is ~3.58 (which is very slight, but I'm like that :-). Especially
    in b&w rendering (which still exists, so we can't ignore it) this method gives
    better results than choosing some integer degree. Also, when I'm working on a
    slanted design I can move a vertex one em laterally and n ems vertically and I
    won't be changing the angle. And most of all, there is <em>no</em> reason to stick
    with integer degrees in a digital world (except for extreme revivalism).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I said I'd been using what Ben is calling \"rational fraction\" angles -for both

    But what David was saying is that there is no single magic rational angle that
    will do this for all rendered sizes. The above illustration works much smoother
    at 12px, sure, but will again give an uneven stairstep at 10px or 11px for instance.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    somewhat size-dependent. So, if you're working with a single outline, it\u2019s
    a matter of choosing your poison.\r\n"

    much worse.\r\n\r\nKent, that's not entirely accurate. When you have a \"rational
    fraction\" inclination the worst that can happen is the outermost step gets truncated;
    plus if you have a head-serif, you don't notice a thing.\r\n\r\nAnd you still
    have the ease-of-editing that I mentioned. Again: why use integer angles? What's
    the advantage of 11 degrees over 1/5 = ~11.31 degrees for example?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I'm just thinking out loud really. I'm gathering that a rational angle is
    better for even steps; but, in fact the 2-3-2-3 slope also describes a rational
    angle of 2:5. And 2:5 would be perfect if you're looking at a 10px height. But
    at 12px we have the 2-3-2-3, which isn't just truncated, it's uneven all the way
    along. So it all leads in a circle, doesn't it?

    that converting to a rational angle helped this?<\r\n\r\nactually it's 2-3-2-3-2
    (12) and 3-3-3-3 (12) in the example - it's a 12px high stem, the first stem has
    a 5 x 12 px box, the second stem has a 4 x 3 px box (hence the difference in gradient
    angle)\r\n\r\nThe formula (so called) only works when the height of the glyph
    part in question can be sub divided equally AND still create the same-ish slope
    angle, eg. 9, 12, 20, etc  What was suggested for all those other intermediate
    pixel sizes? That's where it gets interesting :) Also what was suggested for a
    font where the x-height obeys the formula but the baseline to Cap height does
    not? or vise versa?\r\n\r\nNot exactly ground breaking technique but prob good
    for a bit of conference 'wow' effect :o\r\n\r\nIt depends at what large px height
    you consider all this gets irrelevant (28?, 32? higher?), but if you at least
    nail 5 or 6 heights down amongst the 'small sizes' like this then at least the
    intermediate px sizes have something well balanced to go to/from. \r\n\r\nand
    isn't it pretty much WindowsGDI essential only? far less an issue with the 'other'
    render engines. \r\n"

    I call it \"integer slope\", meaning 1/n where n is an integer.\r\n\r\n> 2:5 would
    be perfect if you're looking at a 10px height\r\n\r\n1) No \"perfect\". Never
    \"perfect\".  :-)\r\n2) It's pretty steep (although I admit that might help onscreen).\r\n3)
    I'd rather have an integer slope with a truncation, but in this case maybe at
    both ends, so 2-3-3-2.\r\n\r\n> It depends at what large px height you consider
