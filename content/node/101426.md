  everyone!\r\n\r\nThis is my new release Edvard:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/edvard_heft2_neu_6380.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/edvard_heft5_5325.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/edvard_heft7_4849.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  font is based on the handwriting of Norwegian painter Edvard Munch. Using his many
  letters, drafts, note- and sketchbooks as reference (source: Archive of Edvard Munch's
  writings), this font characterizes the elegant yet sometimes quite irregular writing
  style Munch had. To resemble naturalistic writing and remain as authentic as possible,
  a combination of extended ligatures and alternates has been included, as well as
  Swash characters (accessible via open-type). Additionally, several of Munch\u2018s
  paintings and woodcuts are embedded as extras. Available at [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/julia-bausenhardt/edvard|Fontspring]]
  and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/julia-bausenhardt/edvard|Myfonts]].\r\n\r\n[[http://juliabausenhardt.de/Edvard|More

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nsim, I included some |t| variations in the ligatures, so with
    OT ligatures turned on there are 12 or so different lower case t's. Most of them
    don't feature the cross stroke - it's just the way he wrote and I wanted to preserve
    that."

  body: "Can I ask if you have permission from the Munch heirs? Some of these \u2018woodcuts\u2019
    are seriously mangled. I was a bit surprised to see your Kafka font, since FF
    Mister K have gotten so much attention lately. A closer look reveals auto-tracing
    artifacts, yet they both Edvard and Kafka are much more normalized than the actual
    handwriting. Can you elaborate on how you made these?"

  body: "Frode, you don't need a permission to digitize a handwriting.\r\nAs for the
    working process, it's not much different than with any other handwritten font,
    and it's of course a personal decision how much you normalize the curves."

    his art is worth asking about. As for normalizing: just curious. I don\u2019t
    necessarily think a particular method is \u2018better\u2019."

    personal thing, it's worth getting permission to avoid people being upset at you/society.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Well I did of course ask the archive which stores the letters. Otherwise I
    wouldn't have released this font. With the permission for using the paintings/woodcuts,
    I wasn't sure who to contact, so I left that in a kind of limbo. But you're right
    of course, and I will look into it.
