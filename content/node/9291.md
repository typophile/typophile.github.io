    Swash</a> has similar swashes and is a much classier face.

  body: Where is Mark Simonson when you need him. He has alot of swash samples. Can
    anyone ever forget the infamous Courier Swash.

  body: I&#39;m lurking around. Cabernet is probably going to be the best match for
    this since it is a revival of the old film font Caslon Black Swash under a different
    name. Whether Jason did the particular swashes used on the sign is the only question.
