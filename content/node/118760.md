body: "Hello! \r\nI have a trouble when I upload my glyph from illustrator to Font
  Lab. The font is quiet complicated, it's supposed to have a kind of texture. It's
  all traced and all shapes are supposed to be closed (I used the pathfinder). But
  when I copy/paste the font, it gives me the result as in the picture attached...
  \r\nWould any one have an idea of what could be wrong and how could I repare it?
  \r\n\r\nI'm struggling since 3 days. Getting Crazy! Pleaaase.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture

    seems like there is too much points and that FL don't support it... \r\n"

  body: While I agree with Bob that it likely has too many points, you can prove that
    by downloading a Demo copy of Glyphs (www.glyphsapp.com) and try pasting the same
    art into that editor. If something similar occurs, then your art has a problem.

  body: George is correct you need to test art for complexity. Another way to test
    would be to import a simpler shape and see if you get all the kinked paths etc
    again.
