body: "I though maybe this could be a sharing of utility typefaces. For example: typefaces
  that had perfectly round O's or nice square E's, or Equilateral Y's... just a thought
  for discussion. One of my newest goto's is Gotham. It has a large family, it's fresh,
  it's new and it's super readable for body copy and it's heavier weights are great
  for super dominant thundering headlines. Talk amongst yourselves?\r\n\r\nKevin"

  body: You are quite right. The bowl is more of an ellipse. The more even stroke
    of this font is useful for constructing forms though.

  body: "There are some typefaces which have perfectly circular forms, rather than
    those which have been optically adjusted. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to see
    a list of those."

  body: Did you measure the distances? The version of Avant Garde XLt that I have
    has vertical elements thicker than the horizontals, so there has been some optical
    adjustment. It may be a different version, however.
