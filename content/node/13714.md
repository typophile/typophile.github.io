  in Austria. Died 1985 in California.\r\n\r\nHerbert Bayer was a student at the [[Bauhaus]],
  who later became a <strong>Master</strong> there (their egalitarian term for professor).
  At the Bauhaus, he developed several typeface proposals along the lines of his idea
  for a [[Universal Typeface]], which would be unicase. Bayer helped keep almost all
  type at the Bauhaus during its Dessau years lowercase only. On the school letterhead,
  which he designed, was an enormous footnote explaining the lack of capital letters
  (\"why write big when you cannot speak big?\").\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the Bauhaus,
  Bayer was one of Germany's leading commercial artists. Somehow untainted by the
  Bauhaus' communist reputation, Bayer spent much of the 1930s designing for the Nazis
  (see [[German Nationalism]]). Never a Nazi party member himself, he emigrated to
  New York in 1938.\r\n\r\nBayer would become an executive at J. Walter Thompson,
  and a consummate American. His Nazi party associations have rarely been brought
  up, either during his life or after it."
