body: "I've been looking at [[ITC Berkeley]] Oldstyle. I think that's what the British
  Harry Potter books are set in and I've been reading a lot of them with my son recently.
  (Let me know if I'm wrong). That led me to FB [[Californian]] and then LTC Californian.
  There's a discussion in the archives (http://typophile.com/node/3077) comparing
  Berkeley and FB Californian, with some talk about the LTC version, which wasn't
  actually released at the time. It now is released, in Opentype and at a very good
  price (www.lanstontype.com). Has anyone used it? Have an opinion to share?\r\n\r\nThe
  consensus in the earlier thread seemed to be that ITC Berkeley was relatively sanitized,
  FB truer to the original Goudy design and more 'quirky'. The LTC version claims
  to be closest to the original and looks beautiful on the Lanston PDFs."

  body: i'm partial to LTC Californian, but that's because i digitized it. the advantage
    of this Californian is that it is in OT format and supports a full Central European
    Characterset. I still love Californian FB and the advantage I see to this set
    is that you have a much greater range of weights/styles. I'd love to expand our
    LTC family to include cyrillics and more weights, and we may do that if we get
    enough interest in this type family. i prefer both versions of californian to
    berkely.

  body: "I have seen a lot of the two other (ITC and FB) \"Californian\" efforts,
    and I think they look pretty good on their own merits, but if a person wants Californain
    true to the origianl it would be hard to beat P22's LTC Californian, since it
    was digitized directly from newsprint proofs of the patterns which Goudy made
    with his own hands.\r\n\r\nFor today's useage I guess it is expedient to supply
    at least one bolder version, but it would be hard work to make one that comes
    up to the earthiness of the original. In Goudy's book \"Typologia\" there are
    large point size specimens of both the roman and italic, which show clearly the
    wonderful grittiness of his original, since these were proofed from the lead patterns
    retrieved from the Lanston Monotype works shortly after the designers workshop
    (Deepdene) was wiped out by the fire.\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

  body: "Speaking of LTC Goudy stuff, a design faculty person recently pointed out
    that he couldn't stand the lc \"a\" in Kennerley. I actually saw something in
    it that I liked, and drew a lc \"a\" over a large undercooked burger off of Harvard
    Square the following day. But my main question is, now that I'm taking a closer
    look, is the LTC version* sanitized, or is the Berthold version** just plain wrong?\r\n\r\n*

  body: looking at the original "a", i could see how you could get both variations,
    especially if you're referring to smaller sizes. however, i have to agree that
    the LTC version is more sanitized.

  body: I don't think santized is the right word. I'd say LTC is designed from the
    metal and perhaps Berthold from the print. Which is a great debate anyway.
