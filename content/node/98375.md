body: "Hello,\r\nFirstly, please excuse the poor image. The lettering is about 40
  feet up and this is the only piece I can obtain. If anyone is able to identify I'd
  be grateful. I've been through a few Copperplate styles but I'm unable to make a
  match, particularly the numerals.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nTB\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1066_6298.jpg]"
