body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DarkSats003_4434.jpg]\r\n\r\nI don't know
  anything about this really. A friend of mine wants to know what it is and I agreed
  to help but haven't had any luck on Identifont or whatthefont.com. The thing that's
  really frustrating is I swear I recognize it. Again any help is much appreciated.
