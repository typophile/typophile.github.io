  that features 2 columns to the right of the body text that look like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://i40.tinypic.com/2uff71d.png\r\n\r\nI'm
  a fan of the Helvetica titles, and was wondering if there's a website out there
  that has this. I did come across [[http://www.templates.lawnydesigns.com/2009/01/3-column-orange-style-blogger-template.html|this]],
  but it's an XML template and I'm not familiar with working with XML, so I'd need
  more of an old-fashioned alternative. I've seen this on more than one template,
  but I've looked for a few hours now and can't find anything else.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for all of your help!"

    my own skins for blogs. "
