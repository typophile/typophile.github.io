  posts in the Type ID forums that have utterly 100% generic subject headers like
  \"Help identify this font\", \"What is this type?\", \"ID Please\", etc. Aaaaaarggh!\r\n\r\nMake
  it go away!\r\n\r\nJust kidding. I know it won't ever end, but jeez..."

  body: "I guess font IDs come largely from people who do not hang around here on
    a regular basis. So all \"education\" is kind of fighting windmills. \r\nI for
    one don't mind, on the contrary: Since i watch the Typophile forums via RSS feed
    in Firefox a line like \"What's this bl**dy font\" tells me more than \"Miniblock\",
    which could be an ID or a release or something completely different. "

    censored the word \u201Cbloody\u201D in your post. Is it considered profanity
    when used in that context where you live?"

  body: "@Ed_Aranda: AFAIK the software behind many web forums filters non-pc words,
    so I wouldn't run the risk ;-) In my view it is rather a damn fucking US obsession
    with sex and crime.\r\n\r\nLet's see if this goes through :-)\r\n\r\n(As for where
    I live: it depends on how you translate it)\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n\r\n"
