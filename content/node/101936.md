    italic once upon a time and an evil wizard cast a spell of reverse-slant on it
    and made it upright.\r\nSee below a comparison of your sample (artificially slanted)
    to a Times Italic, to judge yourself if this scenario makes sense:\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/report-italic_6192.jpg]"

    formerly-\"happy\" Italic, since it was designed just as it is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
