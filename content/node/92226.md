body: Hello. Majev Avec is the serifed (hence "Avec") counterpart to Majev Sans, which
  I am posting in the Sans forum. This is just a prototype, existing only in regular
  roman and italic. It's intended to be an Aldine, but it's not quite working as such.
  (It's more of a clumsy Minion, alas.)

    is having a lot of trouble agreeing on a baseline."
