  designed it from scratch, and I'm a font-designer-newbie, so I really would like
  some tips on how to get it to work...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nSee the old

  body: "When I was looking at it for the first time, something seemed to confuse
    me. That's the reason why I took a screenshot and inserted a baseline and the
    x-height. The attatched screenshot kind of reveals the issues very quickly. First
    thing you have to do is achieving a better vertical alignment. Regarding to the
    baseline, all your letters -- except the \"a\" -- are just touching it instead
    of cutting into it, to balance the stem of the \"a\". Concerning the x-height,
    your \"a\" is way to small and should be raised up to the height of \"e\". All
    in all you need to take a closer look at the vertical alignment of round and straight
    elements. Maybe <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61157\">this thread</a> helps
    you understanding what I mean. Maybe anyone else knows a better example.\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blueblau_6016.jpg]"

    the cut-off on the B's, L's and the A. Further more, I have put on the logo on
    white background.\r\n\r\nSorry for my bad English.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blueblau

  body: the kerning is very inconsistent. More obvious are the 2 "bl".

  body: "While this new one looks more \"creative\" the old one is more consistent.\r\nI'd
    try to make the l and e's ending angles like the a (90\xB0) and let it breathe
    a bit more!\r\nBy the way, nice site! even if the title is \"Design that speaks
    every language\" but there's not an english version."

    :-)\r\n\r\n@Martijn van Berkel \r\nDo you meen the type on the site, or the font
    I've used in this redesign? The \"font\" I've used on the redesign, is homemade.
    I'm not a typedesigner, so I know it's far from perfect.\r\n\r\nIf the B and L
    kerning is the same, what else do you think should be different?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
