body: "I recently noticed that everywhere I want to use a straight quote (because
  no fonts I use contain real tick marks) I was getting left quotes instead. Eventually
  I realized that in Preferences >> Type \"Use Typographer\u2019s Quotes\" was checked.
  I keep disabling it, and it keeps coming back. Is this a per-file setting that will
  keep coming back in old files? Is it supposed to be on by default? Is there a way
  to make sure that it never, ever comes on?"

  body: "<em>...it will stay off by default.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's a bit radical. You
    might want to learn some keys first -- try them at random, 'cause I'm not at work,
    behind the 'good' computer.\r\nThere are keys to toggle smart and dumb quotes
    translation, and to insert both the single and double straight quote. Try combinations
    of Alt, Shift, and Ctrl (prob. Cmd on the Mac) with the Quote key and the '['
    and ']' keys.\r\n\r\nIf pressing keys at random fails, look them up in the Keyboard
    Shortcut Editor (under the Edit menu). The fastest way to find what you need is
    simply hitting the Show Set button. This will create a plain text document, and
    open it automatically in your plain text editor. Use the Find command there to
    find what you need."

    the Smart Quote toggle.\r\n(And remember whether you're in smart quote mode or
    not. I always forget -- perhaps a tiny icon wanted?)\r\n\r\nReason for my elaboration
    is, do you really want them <em>always off</em> by default? If so, do what Miguel
    sez."

    most programs default to English quotes, if they provide automatic translation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps

  body: I've got curly quotes set as default in the Preferences>Dictionary drop down

    they're all coming out straight...does anyone have a fix for this? Have I inadvertently
    pressed some other option?
