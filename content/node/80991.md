    at Village does this on the U, but I'd never call it a text type.

  body: "Hrant, that's a good question. Haven't really thought about it, but I'll
    try now. Since I started drawing type (not that long ago), I've (unconsciously)
    felt that the shallow curve of the 'U', abruptly transitioning into a straight
    stem, really doesn't relate to anything else in the upper case. It's always a
    little wrong, somehow. It's late invention was perhaps done by lesser minds than
    the genius(es) who made the masterpiece the original (upper case) Latin alphabet
    is. So my 'U's are just my (possibly) feeble attempt at reinventing one of the
    very few flawed glyphs of the upper case. (The 'J', an even later invention, is
    another.)\r\n\r\nBesides, I like cuspy shapes. \r\n\r\nBen, thank you. Will you
    post your new typeface on Typophile? \r\n\r\n"

  body: Looks like we both suffer from the too many typefaces under simultaneous development-syndrome,
    Ben. Or is that perhaps common to all type designers? I really hope you'll continue
    work on Nola, though. And yes, I think it will indeed need cuspy 'U's, along with
    the other cusps.

    the same way. Those who standardized it weren't thinking straight. I myself have
    come to prefer the full-right-stem style (even though it might be too lowercase-like),
    although I've only actually used it in one Italic so far.\r\n\r\nPeri\xF3dico
    is a great find! Thanks. And only two months old.\r\n\r\nAnd Freundschafts-Antiqua
    is quite fascinating - reminds me of the work of Gudrun Zapf von Hesse. I wonder
