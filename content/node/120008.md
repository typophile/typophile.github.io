  ways that they can go about reducing the amount of energy that their home uses.
  This is a time honored practice of reducing energy bills, and something that everyone
  should consider. However, if you live in the state of Ohio, thanks to energy deregulation,
  you have another very effective way of saving money on your energy bills. The way
  you can do this, is to have competition within the energy industry, something that
  up till 1997 wasn't available.<p><p>\r\n\r\nDeregulation has allowed people to choose
  from various energy providers throughout Ohio. Most Ohio residents have at least
  two, if not multiple, choices for energy companies. In addition to private energy,
  such as <a href=\"http://www.jeteye.com/jetpak/c1c2acd8-c77b-4201-901a-76a214a45ebf/\">duke
  energy in ohio</a>, there are also a number of local and state operated utility
  companies that provide utility services as well. Typically, you'll find that private
  energy providers, such as first energy Ohio, offers better prices than government
  run utility companies. However, in some cases, you might find that the government
  run utility companies offer better customer service. You may need to consider what's
  more important to you, having cheap prices or being treated well. Of course, the
  best option is to find a company that offers both.<p><p>\r\n\r\nThere is, however,
  some detractors of energy deregulation and one of the concerns, especially in the
  state of Ohio, was having to deal with potential outages as well as upgrades to
  the existing power grid. In an attempt to ensure that residents of Ohio were able
  to choose their own energy company, and choose an energy plan that offered them
  quality service and cost savings, it was made mandatory that state and local utility
  providers were still obligated to maintain the existing power grid, regardless of
  which company operates that particular grid. What this did was to successfully dispel
  any concerns over overlapping of services and equipment, which could leave the consumer
  in a very difficult position should the power lines need to be repaired or upgraded.<p><p>\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see, whether you choose first energy or any one of the other 23 energy companies
  available, you now have a choice. This allows you to get better service and better
  prices as utility companies are finally vying for your business. While competition
  was virtually nonexistent before 1997, today, as a resident of Ohio, you can enjoy
  the competitive energy market where you are getting quality utility services at
  lower than average prices. Considering how much money people have to spend on utilities,
  the potential savings are tremendous, and it is one of the reasons why many other
  states are actively looking into deregulating their energy industry.<p><p>\r\n\r\n"
