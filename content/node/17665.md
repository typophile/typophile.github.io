body: "I'm still wrestling with a Unicode Opentype cross-platform font that will work
  in various apps. Although it is definitely a temporary 'hack', I found that replicating
  the ccmp feature as liga, and placing it after ccmp, seemed to work as a temporary
  measure. The characters are now rendered properly in Word and InDesign. However,
  the problem I have now is with spell checking in MS Word 2003. When I attempt to
  add words created with the OpenType font, via the tools/options/spelling/custom
  dictionary dialog, Word complains that the 'word cannot be added because the speller
  cannot handle some of the characters it contains'. It was my understanding that
  using unicode characters with codepoints (versus PUA) will allow spell checkers
  to work properly. \r\n\r\nAm I missing something?"

    Office (Office 2003 and before). Since Custom Dictionary was ANSI, adding words
    from Unicode-only languages was not possible. (We made it work by putting some
    fixes for Indic languages where we knew the Unicode ranges of Indic scripts) \r\n\r\n>Good
    news is that this has been fixed in O12 where we have converted/made Custom Dictionary
    Unicode. This change will basically allow adding words from any languages with
    Unicode encoding. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n \r\n\r\n"
