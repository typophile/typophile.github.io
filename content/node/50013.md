    here are a couple options: \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_complete/\">Proxima
    Nova</a> - note the available <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_bold/?sample_text=See%20alternate%20G%20below.&acs_pt=36&acs_ss=12\">alternate
    'G'</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/ars_maquette/\">ARS

    Proxima G is nice too but does not come in a lighter weight which is what I need.
    Are there any others you can suggest?\r\n"
