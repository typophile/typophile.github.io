body: "I have been out of the loop for awhile, due to some time-consuming family business,
  so I don't know if this topic has been discussed yet. Anyhow...\r\n\r\nI have had
  several inquiries concerning licensing fees for web-based applications and have
  yet to come up with an acceptable solution. Licensing fees are normally based on
  the number of users, but the number is usual fairly consistent over time and each
  user is assumed to have unlimited access to a licensed font. With these apps, the
  number of users varies\u2014ideally, if the developer has a killer app, users could
  number in the thousands\u2014but the actual usage time is rather limited.\r\n\r\nAs
  far as I can see, the most sensible way to assess fees would be to have a meter-based
  system that would charge the developer a nominal fee\u2014say, 5\xA2 or so\u2014each
  time a font was used. Unfortunately, none of the developers who have contacted me
  knows of any available software that would accomplish this task. Bottom line, until
  some enterprising programmer sees some profit in developing a meter-used licensing
  system, I am stuck with coming up with a set fee that is fair to all parties involved.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  got any ideas, experiences, guidelines, or such to share?"

  body: "I thought about this before releasing Downturn for web embedding and the
    following items came to mind:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Nobody wants to deal with per-use
    royalty rates. Unlike print campaigns, it\u2019s not something that most projects
    can budget for. Sure a designer might only expect ten-thousand individual users
    a month, but if Digg, Slashdot, or BoingBoing link to a site that number can exceed
    a few hundred thousand in just hours, possibly resulting in royalties that exceed
    a small project\u2019s yearly profits. And unless you want to set up and manage
    the tracking server yourself, you\u2019ll probably get ripped off by under-reporting
    (just ask musicians how they feel about album sales reporting).\r\n\r\n\u2022
    From a designer\u2019s perspective, licensing type for a web project is very limiting.
    They don\u2019t care how many users are getting it, they just care that they\u2019re
    probably only going to be able to use each license on one web site and one server
    and probably only for a few years or months, depending on the project. Contrast
    that to buying a solid workhorse face for print use, where it\u2019s generally
    usable over and over until software no longer supports the font format, without
    ever paying again.\r\n\r\nBased on these observations, I decided that the best
    way to go is with per-server, per-site licenses at the same price or less (I chose
    the same because I only sell the fonts through MyFonts, which has limitations
    with pricing). It could really work in your favor to sell cheap server licenses
    and make money in volume when designers use the font on multiple projects, or
    if you\u2019re lucky, on web-sites with redundant load-balanced server pools.

    to render text for the end-user to read? If so, then I'd think it'd be like print.
    \r\n\r\nIf we're talking about a font used to render end-user created work, such
    as an online business card printer or gift card creator, then I'd think that deserves
    a much higher license as now we're talking product. \r\n\r\n"

  body: 'The latter instance: a website offers to print labels or business cards or
    whatever, and wants to offer its customers a wide choice of typefaces. The end
    user doesn''t end up with a copy of the font, only a printed piece which used
    the font in the production process. So, in essence, the end user is not purchasing
    a license: he or she is merely "renting" the outlines on a temporary basis.'

    license of some sort. It''d probably be difficult and prohibitive to track a per
    instance use of it so you''d be better off with a bigger up front license cost.  '

  body: That license fee is going to be somewhere between a multi-user license and
    a full-blown enterprise license. I think I remember a major player selling server
    licenses for its fonts at 10x the single user price, with discounts for multiple
    fonts licensed.

  body: "Max, I suspect that anyone using Adobe fonts as you describe is using them
    illegally, which is to say under conditions not covered by the licensing agreement.
    If you want to knock off some of your competitors, you could probably point out
    this little detail to Adobe's legal department, if you had a mind to...but that
    would be wrong.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, since you are a potential customer who has
    seen a WIDE variety of possible pricing options, what is a \"middle ground\" you
    could live with? Everyone's gotta eat, but no one needs to be greedy. Is a ten-user
    license, from your point of view, an acceptable compromise? I just need some feedback:
    so far, I've had to pass on three offers because I am currently clueless about
    what would be fair to ALL parties concerned..."

  body: Something else to consider is the benefit of sales that might be gained from
    having these sites promote your type. Most of your catalog is priced well within
    the budget of amateur users, students, scrapbookers, etc. Getting the site to
    credit the typeface, or even link to it, might be worth discounting the license
    cost as it might bring in customers who might not be exposed to your designs otherwise.

  body: "I guess it depends on how that affects the price and what the base price
    is, but doubling or tripling the base price seems reasonable to me. I probably
    don't have, at peak times, more than three or four people using my editor at once,
    so a 10-seat license seems more than adequate if you're looking at it from that
    angle.\r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure I understand your math. If 500 people a month use a font and
    each use were \"a few cents,\" that's $15 a month or $180 a year. Where do you
    get $3000?\r\n\r\nYou're, of course, welcome to charge whatever you want for your
    work. There is a huge range of pricing and quality in the world of fonts, and
    maybe your work is worth $3000/weight. But I don't think the market is there.
    Would you rather sell a hundred licenses at $100 each or zero licenses at $3000
    each?\r\n"

  body: "Pricing for this kind of use is all over the place. I run an online printer
    and have contacted probably a dozen type foundries about using fonts on my site.
    They range from being fine with it on a regular license (on the logic that it's
    a single installation) to being breathtakingly restrictive and expensive ($1500/weight
    with a 100 character limit), to simply being impossible at any price. Adobe, for
    example, has told me that they don't allow this kind of use under any license,
    which makes me wonder how some of my competitors are using their fonts.\r\n\r\nIt's
    difficult to put a price on this kind of use. Maybe some kind of volume-based
    percentage makes the most sense, but as James mentioned the unpredictability of
    that makes it a tough sell. But this isn't that different than the off-line world:
    as a designer, I can buy a $100 font and use it in a $500 logo or as the centerpiece
    of a $50k advertising campaign. In the same way, an online design site might sell
    a $6 rubber stamp a week or be doing Vistaprint-level sales. I think there are
    far more of the former than the latter, so I'd suggest gearing your pricing toward
    them.\r\n"

    did recently get an email from a customer who liked the font she used so much
    that she licensed it. It's hard to say how many sales something like that really
    generates, but it can't hurt.\r\n"
