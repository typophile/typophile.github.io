  good use?  <BR> <BR>Client branding standards dictate that I use these faces for
  a consumer publicaton. Since neither face would be my first &#40;or second, or third...&#41;
  choice, I&#39;m eager to see examples of them used well. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m already
  aware of these publications: <BR>- More &#40;U.S. women&#39;s magazine, Frutiger
  for display and some text&#41; <BR>- Business 2.0, Vanity Fair &#40;Times for body
  copy&#41; <BR>- Fortune &#40;Times for body copy and display&#41; <BR>- Critique
  &#40;R.I.P. - used Times for for body copy and display&#41; <BR>- Macworld &#40;U.S.
  edition uses Frutiger for sidebar text&#41; <BR> <BR>Any others? Non-U.S. publications
  are OK, too, especially if they have U.S. distribution or a downloadable PDF. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks!'
