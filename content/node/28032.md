  me), but could anyone help identify this front for me? At first I thought it was
  Engraver's Gothic, but closer examination led me to think otherwise. It's slightly
  jazzier, yes?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mario_logo_nohome_5512.gif]"

    body: Hmmm . . . I looked at lots of Gill variants, and in all the cap "R" and
      "B" look quite a bit different.

    body: Gotham is close, I think, but there are still differences in the "R" and
      "B"--which leads me to believe that it's another typeface. But thanks for pointing
      me to Gotham, which I like in its own right.

    body: Y'all are so great, wow. This is the closest yet, but I don't think an exact
      match. The "T" in the Mario specimens is wider, as I see it, and the ampersand
      quite a bit taller. But thanks for pointing me to this font.
