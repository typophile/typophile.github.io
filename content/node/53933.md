body: "In my ongoing search for interesting type related art for home, does anyone
  know of a nice poster design, showing the evolutionary milestones in the development
  of type, at least in the latin alphabet, from blackletter, through humanist, oldstyle,
  transitional, modern etc, along with important names and dates?\r\n\r\nIf none exists
  I think this would be a great project, and would produce something worthy of hanging
  on the office wall."

    school, long before I dreamed that I would work for much of my adult life as a
    graphic designer, I bought this big box of \"Foot-High Letters\" that I found
    in a museum gift shop. It was a 1960s Dover reprint of a 1940 publication, probably
    originally intended for use in art classrooms. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letters4_4765.JPG]\r\nThey're
    really meant to show the distinguishing characteristics of type families rather
    than the history of type design, but they still make handsome conversation pieces.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letters1_5321.JPG]\r\nA
    quick Google search turned up few UK dealers who list this set for the equivalent

  body: "Steve, here's a quick translation of the text on that web site. Sorry if
    it sounds garbled \u2013 my brain's like 99% full of my font right now :-)\r\n\r\n<em>An
    educational poster for real connoisseurs of the Black Art. For the first time,
    this overview shows all German type foundries, as well as more than 200 takeovers
    and transfers, as a logical, genealogical tree. Connecting lines highlight individual
    developments. The resulting view clearly outlines the rise and bloom of the Black
    Art, as well as its abrupt termination by the rise of phototype. \r\nGutenberg
    was the first European to print with movable type. His idea quickly found enthusiastic
    followers, who continued to spread type casting throughout Germany and Europe.
    This new technology brought forth numerous new typefaces, the most important of
    which are displayed on the poster.</em>\r\n\r\nI can recommend Christian's posters,
    though I haven't seen this one; I have his 2009 calendar poster and it's beautifully
    laid out and printed. I'm pretty sure he speaks English, so you could also email
    him directly with any further questions (there's an email link on the \"Impressum\"
    page)."
