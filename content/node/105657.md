  (or identical) might have been created in the interim.  Working on a project to
  raise money for a King Records-related project in Cincinnati and would love to be
  able to make use of the actual logo font.  Thank you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/King-Logo-sm_4847.jpg]"

  body: "The logo lettering dates from the mid 1940s., vut is not identical to the
    modern logo.\r\n1946:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/King1946_5039.jpg]\r\n1948:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/King1948_4926.jpg]\r\nSimilar
    lettering was used for a sister label, Queen. Here is a 78 from 1947:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Queen1947_6458.jpg]\r\nThis
    would have been sufficient for Nick Curtis to make a font, but IIRC he did not
    do this one.\r\nPerhaps someone else did?\r\nDon\r\n"
