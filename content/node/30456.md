  body: "Silenta is a wonderful face that looks like a near relative of ITC Korinna.
    (This face has more of a slab serif feel to it - and reminds me of Rockwell.)\r\n\r\nIn
    running your sample letters through WTF - it came up with 5 \"similar\" fonts
    - \r\nof which I think if you are looking for a substitute - one of them might
    actually do the trick -\r\nEutheric Bold\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/eutheric/bold/\r\n\r\nPlease
    remember - this is only similar - not exact."

  body: "These are two intertitles from \"PATHS TO PARADISE\" (1925), starring Raymond
    Griffith, but I've seen this typeface used in lots and lots of Paramount silents
    from the early to mid-1920s.  I already have Silentina, which is rather different
    from what I'm looking for, and which came into heavy use with all studios in the
    mid-to-late '20s.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing me to Eutheric Bold.  It is sorta
    close; kinda reminds me of a cross between bookman and silentina.  It's possible
    if I try using Eutheric Bold and stretching it a wee bit I might get close.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else have some suggestions to match the typeface I'm looking for would be much
    appreciated.\r\n\r\nBen"

    Bureau's own incorrigible [[David Berlow]] is based on silent film era lettering.
    I recall he showed another font at a conference, Rome I think, that was even closer
    still.\r\n\r\n[Edit: I meant, \"based upon the fonts which were based upon the
    lettering for Louis B. Meyer.\"]"

    256 of MacGrew's American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century. I don't think
    it has been digitized.

    was often used for silent movie intertitles.

    for the nice work on Silentina. Mark, perhaps you could answer a question about
    the Silentina pair that's been nagging at me. I've got a 1925 BB&S Catalog, so
    I know that Silentina Movie, including the alternates, was made from Pastel. Any
    idea where Silentina Film's different capitals come from?"

  body: Mike - thank you for directing us to HPLHS - I LOVE the prop CD and can use
    it (alot!) for one of the theatre groups I work with. I've always re-created by
    hand, taking hours, and not charging them for that labor. What a nice treat this
    Wednesday morning...

    a matter of fact, I do.\r\n\r\nA guy named Rodney Sauer, a musician who is also
    involved with restoring silent movies, contacted me about five years ago about
    identifying the typeface used for the intertitles in a certain film (or series
    of films, possibly). It turned out to be Pastel, but in some of the samples he
    had, the caps looked more like Della Robbia.\r\n\r\nI did a rough digitization
    of Pastel for him, but he really wanted the other caps. I said I would see what
    I could do, but got too busy with other projects and I ended up never finishing
    it.\r\n\r\nFast-forward two years and Ray Larabie releases Silentina. It turns
    out that Rodney gave up waiting for me and went to Ray. In the end I think Ray
    did a decent job of it and I tip my hat to him."
