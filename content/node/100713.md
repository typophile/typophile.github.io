  long newly merged company. The company name is North American Home Furnishings Association-
  do you go with an acronym NAHFA? Or do you attempt something with the entire name
  spelled out? Or both? All of the companies involved in the new company previously
  had some sort of acronym in their logos, NHFA, HFIA, WHFA. \r\n\r\nAnd if designing
  using acronym - any design tips for something long and awkward?"

  body: Change the name of the company. It's no longer Merril Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
    and Beane ... or even International Business Machines ... shorter is better. After
    a year or two the old names that are fit into the new name no longer are important.

  body: "> Crazy impossible to design anything decent \r\n> with a five letter senseless
    acronym\r\n\r\nSorry but I've got to disagree with you. \"CBS\" is an acronym,
    but that didn't stop them from having a great logo.  Other acronym companies include
    ABC, NBC, KFC, AT&T, NASA, and a gazillion others, and many of them have excellent
    logos. \r\n\r\nCome up with an elegant symbol that graphically represents what
    the organization does. (Yeah, I know, easier said than done. :)\r\n\r\nSince \"NAHFA\"
    is an unfamiliar acronym to the general public, you'll probably need to spell
    out the full name in small type below or beside the logo. I'd suggest breaking
    the long name into multiple lines, and maybe you can get away with abbreviating
    \"association\".\r\n\r\nAs for the symbol itself, I'd start with research and
    make a collection of logos (both good and bad) from other organizations in similar
    lines of business. Obviously you don't want to copy anyone, but it may help give
    you ideas, help you see what works and what doesn't, and will help to prevent
    you from accidentally coming too close to an existing logo.\r\n"

    acronym, not just an acronym.\r\n\r\nthe first thing i would think is to use a
    san serif, to reduce the complexity.\r\n\r\nthen be further reductive, by reducing,
    and joining the letter forms. a bit like the old nasa logo."

    body: This is the direction I have been trying, and breaking up the name into
      two sections, North American, followed underneath by Home Furnishings Association.
      Using simple font such as Helvetica Neue or AvantGarde. Still blocky and busy,
      but I do agree with your suggestion...

  body: "Five letters isn't a long name, and it's no more senseless (to use the OP's
    term) than many other company acronym names. \r\n\r\nGEICO \u2014 Government Employees
    Insurance Company\r\nAFLAC \u2014 American Family Life Assurance Company\r\nQUANTAS
    \u2014 Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, some
    companies use names that are totally made-up or are deliberately misspelled. For
    example, \"Google\" is a deliberate misspelling of \"Googol\", and for all practical
    purposes is a nonsense word, but things have worked out pretty well for them.\r\n\r\nI
    know it can be easier if the company name is more descriptive, but I'm just saying
    that lots of companies face this challenge."

  body: "Maybe it would be helpful to step back and re-frame the problem. Instead
    of asking \"how can I deal with the length of this name aesthetically?\" ask yourself
    \"how can I communicate the identity of this organization in a way that is effective
    for the target audience?\" An effective solution will depend a lot more on the
    impression you are trying to make than on some universal idea of what looks nice.
    Ask the visionaries in the company why the name must be exactly that to effectively
    communicate who they are. \r\n\r\nAs for acronyms in general, unless they spell
    something memorable (but not necessarily a real word), you can always throw a
    bunch of money into marketing to make it remembered. The trouble usually comes
    when companies don't have the budget, marketing team, or insight to make this
    work. I think Paul Rand has more insight into this than Lubalin. But remember
    that he worked with huge corporations who assumed they would spend millions on
    marketing to make their brand recognizable. So he said:\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is only
    by association with a product, a service, a business, or a corporation that a
    logo takes on any real meaning. It derives its meaning and usefulness from the
    quality of that which it symbolizes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA logo is less important
    than the product it signifies; what it means is more important that what it looks
    like.\u201D"
