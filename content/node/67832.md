  released typeface]]. Can this really be thought of as derivative of Emigre''s bestselling
  Mrs. Eaves? '

  body: Does it have to be derivative? If it sets well alongside the original then
    that should be enough to use the name.

  body: Emigre version of Baskerville was something new and fresh, while respectful
    of the original. I have not had a chance to see their sans revival, but we'll
    see. Emigre quality just seems to be pretty high.

  body: "OK, just to make my point clearer.\r\n\r\nThis is Mrs Eaves, a post-modern
    Baskerville: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mrs_5105.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is Mr Eaves, its matching sans serif: \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mrsans_4700.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    this is the newly released Mr Eaves Modern XL, a lazy clash between Frutiger and
    Futura:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mrmod_6516.png]\r\n\r\nAm I
    really the only one to think this is misleading marketing?"

    depends. See, for example, the use of Lucida as brand name:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/lucida/"

    <strong>shouldn't</strong> remind you of Mrs Eaves, I think you need to reevaluate
    what it is you think marketing is... It's not misleading at all.. it's about as
    directly leading as it can be... The faces look to have a similar color and features
    and it's not as if they're made by different foundries...\r\n\r\nThey're living
    in the same world. Just let them live happily, separatist klaxon.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: "I find this kind of thing odd. My question would be: how is this last addition
    part of the same family? It looks like the cap height and overall colour have
    been usefully matched with those of Mr and Mrs Eaves, but to me that makes it
    a companion face rather than a member of the same family. \r\n\r\nI'm no expert
    in font marketing but perhaps Modern XL would stand a better chance as a typeface
    in its own right: connecting it this way might actually limit its potential market.
    We'll see."

    members that make the connection \u2014 Mr Eaves Modern (a geometric variation
