body: I&#39;m looking for a freelance graphic designer/artist who is adept at the
  &#39;classical&#39; kind of drawing and design done by Raphael Boguslav. &#40;<a
  href="http://www.boguslav.com" target="_blank">www.boguslav.com</a>&#41; <BR>I contacted
  Raphel and he was not inbetersted in this particular commission due, I think, to
  it&#39;s sexual nature...

    <BR>So inhaling chemicals is OK, but not the way we&#39;re born.  :-/ <BR> <BR>Hey
    Jacques, I guess your new icon was timed perfectly! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    doctors could&#39;t help. After about 25 years I just seemed to grow out of it.
