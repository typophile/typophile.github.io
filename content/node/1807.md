body: Racking my brain over typefaces for an exhibit...so its gotta be display faces
  here. <BR> <BR>I need a script/cursive/handwritting-esque face that would suggest
  the First Peoples of North America...because the content refers to them &#34;speaking&#34;  or
  a letter written by them.  I&#39;d hate to have their words set in anything European.
  I&#39;d love to be true blue and use the real language glyphs but for some reason
  the general public has to read it or something..haha. <BR> <BR>So far I&#39;m using
  Kwikfont just because I can&#39;t find anything else, but I really have to change
  it. - something with super basic letterforming I think. help. <BR> <BR>And then
  to be displayed right along with that another face that is representative of the
  French and English invasion at that time. I found that Regula Antiqua does hold
  proper historical elements for them, so I&#39;m gonna stick with it. - I think.
  <BR> <BR>However, I would really appreciate any suggestion or comment over this.
  Picking out these faces is getting mega stressful as its for a big new museum. I
  can hear the critisisms already.

    <BR>I think your second &#40;Anglo/Franco&#41; face shouldn&#39;t be rough - quite
    the contrary: I&#39;d choose something cold and precise, but preferably also archaic
    - the recent Porchez Didots come to mind. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    hard not to be when I&#39;m going 120pt&#43; <BR> <BR>So, I just changed my mind
    about Regula as well.  <BR> <BR>thought about Camden instead for all of its alternates
    and options for repeat characters...instead of all that repeated roughness that
    is suppose to be letterpress-y but instead looks digitized  <BR> <BR>might get
    razzed for using claudium on the first peoples stuff when the font wanted to be
    french in the first place? <BR> <BR>Cassandre might work - least its not really
    based on anything at all. <BR> <BR>thanks

  body: 'Tanya, the vast majority of Amerindian peoples north of Mexico had no writing
    systems at the time of contact, so I suggest you give up trying to find something
    that conveys &#39;First Peoples&#39;: it would be just one more imposition of
    artificial, non-Native preconceptions on Native culture. Also, consider that Native
    peoples do not consider themselves to be a homogenous mass: they belong to different
    ethnic groups, tribes, civilisations, and to what, in post-contact parlance, they
    came to identify as different nations. So you should consider which Native people
    are referred to in the exhibit, and consider with whom they were in contact. Then
    you might well find that using a contemporary European typeface might be the most
    appropriate choice: one of the significant achievements of many colonised peoples
    around the world has been to take the script and language of the colonial power
    and to redeploy it with their own messages. <BR> <BR>Here is a thought: in English
    language typography it is conventional to use italics for words in foreign languages.
    So you could play on the accepted conventions of the people attending the exhibit,
    and put the messages of Native peoples in roman type -- i.e. make it the norm
    -- and the European text in italics.'

    the curators and editors would have my head. If editors decide to use italic for
    italic reasons and then Euro is italic too, things might get confusing. <BR> <BR>So,
    YES...if there were a font that was created by someone of native background at
    least from the 1800s or a modern face that showed influence from the archives
    that followed latin characters I&#39;d be all over it...but my search bore no
    results...would be super happy if you or someone could suggest one? and yes, I
    need a soft copy. <BR> <BR>Update: I think I might have a replacement through

  body: I&#39;ve been involved with Native American publications since the late 80s.
    <BR> <BR>Since there is no true Native type free from European influence, you
    should concentrate on good design choices for any historical museum exhibit. The
    Native and European text should feel equal. Any self-conscious treatment of the
    Native languages will get you no closer to a true Native typography, and may appear
    to some to be condescending and racist. So, handwritten, distressed, or otherwise
    quirky fonts should be ruled out unless you are also using them for the French/English.
    <BR> <BR>I agree with John Hudson about trying italic &amp; roman to differentiate
    between the cultures. The odd word or two needing to be &#34;italicized&#34; in
    blocks of italic text should be set in roman. If you weren&#39;t tied to using
    period faces, a carefully selected serif / sans serif combination would work well.
    Again, nothing quirky. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s such a wide variety of styles in Native
    American art. I wish we could see the exhibits you are designing for.

  body: 'all the display faces for my part, be it english, french or to native context
    are distressed or will look antiqued. <BR> <BR>See, if we dumb this down - I wonder
    if the general public would understand and see the difference in italic use for
    native content. When  things like native-esque styled Olympic icons, and the Aboriginal
    Television network logo are going, the public gets it, and nobody&#39;s said they
    were condescending.   <BR> <BR>See, I was thinking the other way around. My opinion
    was that if the rest of the place has matching period faces and mine dosen&#39;t
    that that would be condescending to the point where some might suggest there was
    little to no understanding or consideration of their styles. By using a European
    face we are showing that their words are only heard through our voice, and that&#39;s
    especially bad when its written in the 1st person. <BR> <BR>This is why I thought
    of using a handwritten face, because it would show a difference in lifestyles
    at least - one that had machines, has type, letterpress ect....and one that used
    their hands. But in a hand written face....it would have to be free of any obivous
    Euro flourishes, and cursive forms <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll consult the team and ask
    what they think about the italic/roman thing. '

  body: The problem with trying to find an authentic &#34;Native style&#34; is that
    there is none. Even if public opinion isn&#39;t a concern, any attempt to find
    one is likely to be contrived. It&#39;s not a matter of political correctness.
    Even if someone is overly sensitive to what Natives will think, it&#39;ll still
    end up &#34;fake&#34; if they try too hard to find something Native. <BR> <BR>So,
    the real problem for this museum exhibit is finding two clearly contrasting faces
    which go well together and fit the time period covered. The Native aspect is a
    bit of a red herring. <BR> <BR>I was overreacting a bit when I suggested staying
    away from handwritten forms. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve seen people choose primitive
    looking styles when trying to &#34;be native&#34;. In general, the writing samples
    I&#39;ve seen from literate Natives are in the handwriting style of their era.
    Cursives are not unauthentic. I have seen child-like writing from barely literate
    Natives, but it is no different than what you would see from poorly educated Euro-Americans
    from the same era.

    talking about the big picture and representing the &#34;communication&#34; logistics
    of an entire culture.  <BR> <BR>Basic facts: Euros having the printing press in
    full action versus the first peoples who communicate with hand written &#40;carved
    what-have-you&#41;  As well, considering we&#39;re talking &#34;First Peoples&#34;
    and the very first interactions between Euros and natives - I don&#39;t think
    that cursive hand writting is what happened next...basic letterforms, sticks and
    circles perhaps.  <BR> <BR>Either way I sometimes think its strange that we&#39;ve
    become so politically correct that no one thinks it would be proper to use those
    faces that we may refer to as child-like or whimsical letterforms for the first
    peoples when that&#39;s excatly what they probably looked like wihen the first
    colonized groups tried to learn how to write latin characters.  <BR> <BR>And if
    we want to show a written piece that&#39;s more evolved than that, we call it
    cheesy and perhaps offensive to show any latin form that tries to give back any
    teeny bit of credence. <BR> <BR>I can see where if it were about preserving a
    culture how it would be offensive, but this is about the colonization of north

    it about  saving confusion among the idiots who can&#39;t see what the problems
    were.  <BR> <BR>I would never think that examples of Native writting in latin
    forms had any basis to exist per say, but it was part of an evolution...You can&#39;t
    ignore that it did happen. Some how, some way - the first peoples did learn to
    write in english and french language using latin forms. There were some steps
    before perfecting the latin forms that I would suspect had lingering elements
    of various native structures - but I guess its offensive to represent those steps
    and see any kind of merge? <BR> <BR>a modern &#40;latin&#41; face with native
    elements &#40;considering evolution worked the other way around&#41;: wouldn&#39;t
    the resulting kitch be the highest form of flattery, and show a very respectful
    appreciation ,...without all the PC crap, if you look at it this way the recipients
    could be humbled by such attempt. Perhaps we all hate the idea simply because
    we see it as an assumption of style, when we are the style masters.  <BR> <BR>anyway
