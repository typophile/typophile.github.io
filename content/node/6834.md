  body: My first thought was that this was a very widenened version of something like
    Adobe&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/ponderosa/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=72&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=NO+MORE+WAR"
    target="_blank">Ponderosa</a>, but I can see that the result would not match.
    The W serifs are wrong, for one thing. <BR> <BR>I actually think this is the way
    the font really looks without distortion, and it&#39;s making me nuts, because
    I think I have seen this somewhere.

  body: I&#39;m guessing the war in question was Vietnam. Looks sixties to me. But
    I can&#39;t ID it.

  body: That&#39;s certainly similar to the basic style this was based on, and it
    has the right N serifs &#40;as does Wigwam on the previous page&#41;. The W serifs
    are not shown, but Barnum Condensed  &#40;p.25 top&#41; has the wrong W serifs.
    However, it doesn&#39;t seem to me that extending that type would result in the
    same thing as this sample. The E would not be as closed. Adding stroke thickness
    might get close, but remember, most of the Solotype Catalog faces were film type,
    not digital. <BR> <BR>Playbill, P.T. Barnum, Wanted and other similar digital
    fonts don&#39;t have the right serif configurations, and most of the Photo-Lettering
    fonts I saw like this didn&#39;t either, or else the serifs were completely square,
    and not bracketed like these. <BR> <BR>I still think I have seen this as a font,
    but I can&#39;t recall where.
