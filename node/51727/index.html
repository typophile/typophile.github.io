<p>Here is the business card I designed for the man that sold me the toner for my Samsung laser. This was done over two nights. It’s set entirely in Ascenders underrated Miramonte.</p>
<p>Please critique it. I want it to feel clean, precise, and approachable.</p>
<p>The list needs reordering.</p>
<p>How about my comma and ampersand usage???</p>
<p>How is the grammar in this sentance: “If you don’t see it listed here, call Bob. He probably has it in stock!”???</p>
<p>Anything missing?</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/businesscard_3515.png]</p>
<p>I really appreciate all you helps.</p>
<p>This is the first job I get from a total stranger. I don’t want to mess this up.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Mikey :-)</p>

Laser+Toner+Inks on the horizontal blue bar; maybe you should consider adding more space to the right and left margins, cause when trimmed you maybe end up with with the edge very close to the text. If that is 1/8 of inch, ad +1/16.
For the back, the list of items maybe would look better if in a medium face, beacuse of the knock out on the background.
Your customer won&rsquo;t be disappointed if you leave it as is.</div>

<p>I did not design that graphic element. It came from a FontShop freebie&hellip; InterOffice Two.</p>

<p>I’m a broke-as-a-joke designer – I have to make the best of my situation. 
Miramonte was less that 14 dollars. I use Apple Pages ($99 bucks) and I currently can’t afford a 1000 software suite. 
But you won’t see me stealing software either.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/haircut_3717.png]</p>
<p>BTW&hellip; I’m not really that familiar with what constitutes a logo when you use a dingbat. 
If you modify it does that make it logo-able now? Not sure how all that stuff works.</p>

<p>Hi again!</p>
<p>You guys were right! I think it looks much better now. Miramonte does not have a medium weight (yet) so I used bold on the back list that me and my client need to emend.</p>
<p>Does using the bold on the back list mess up the hierarchy—if I even have one?</p>
<p>Do I need to kern the nameplate? Please don’t say yes :-)</p>
<p>I also changed the colors. More “cobalty” and the ghost graphic on the back is less prominent.</p>
<p>The plus signs for “LASER+TONER+INKS” is now matching in weight. I shrunk down the nameplate after you guys told me about it being to close to the edge&hellip; I knew something was not quite right, so thanks for emphasizing that.</p>
<p>I baseline shifted everything that possibly could need it.</p>
<p>I also do feel the card has more air in it too. So I thank you all your suggestions.</p>
<p>Mike Diaz :-)</p>

<p>The front is so much better, there is only one tiny change I&rsquo;d suggest:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bob_6674.png]</p>
<p>&ndash; line up the logo with the right side of his name. That&rsquo;d be a nice counterweight for the left aligned info on the right hand side. (I wondered about the font weight difference, left and right, but I think it&rsquo;s okay. You can also <em>over</em>balance stuff.)</p>
<p>And yes, you definitely have to kern &lsquo;LA&rsquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s too close compared to the rest of the line.</p>

<p>I’m in the process of figuring out of what to do with the little dingbats head. I have Inkscape, but I’m having trouble working with it.</p>
<p>Anyway,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I added 2 percent more space around the LA combination. I added one percent around the TO combination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the rear text list (which is subject to change) I when down one more point and it does look better still.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also added 3 percent more character space and the line spacing has increased too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel pretty good thus far.</p>
<p>The blue will be either 072 blue or 2736 blue&hellip; I think anyway</p>
<p>I have NO idea what this gonna cost the client to print.
BUT I REALLY DON’T KNOW WHAT TO CHARGE HIM :-\</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>SuperUltraFabulous, you should really agree a price with the client up-front. That way no-one gets any unpleasant surprises. Here in the UK, I might charge £30 an hour (call it $45/hour) and estimate, say, a couple of hours for the logo and card. Maybe another couple of hours for other stationery.</p>
<p>But you should always consider two things: what you feel is a reasonable hourly rate, and what the market will bear. Be prepared to negotiate.</p>

You can&rsquo;t choose fancy stocks or anything, but the quality and turn around is good and you can&rsquo;t beat the price. The last run I did was for a bakery - 1000 cards, matte finish with a 2 day delivery and cost $90 Can.</p>
<p>Your design is nice but there is a lot of repeating information. I would suggest trying to put all the product info on the blue side, and keep the white side for the blue strip logo(remove it from the blue side, you don&rsquo;t need it twice) and his contact info.</p>
<p>Cards are so tiny, there&rsquo;s no need to repeat the info :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The list of services on the back side of the card now appear to be off-center towards the right. Suggust you move the two columns to the left so that the left margin is the same as the left margin on the front of the card.</p>
<p>The bullets look a little weak. How about using a plus sign instead of the dot? That would tie into the plus signs in the main display line.</p>
<p>The type for italic blurb on the back side is a little light given the arwork behind it. Hopefully the font you&rsquo;re using has a medium weight that falls between the light and bold weights you&rsquo;re using on the card now.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier post, I like the idea of repeating the contact info on the back. That way no matter which side of the card you pickup, you have the phone number available.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nelson&raquo;&gt; You couldn’t be more right! I thinking between 200 and 300 bucks. Sounds reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Haley&raquo;&gt; <em>High Fives You Back Sista</em> THANK YOU! I called those people and the price is very cheap. Did you opt for the matte finish? In all my Strathmore paper promotions the cards are coated with just an aqueous coating&hellip; wondering if the matte is more fabulous or something. Speaking of Stathmore—5000cards uses 16.4 paper—I have no idea how heavy that is. Strathmore paper goes up 130 lbs which felt nice to me. Did your business cards have a good feel to them?</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/options_6562.png]</p>
<p>I didn’t understand all the options so I called and they were helpful.</p>
<p>Hrant&raquo;&gt; You are right, I’m in the process of designing 3 other different cards for the same client so he can have a few options. I love the little printer guy. He does need more prominance.</p>
<p>Bonus Points if you can recognize these under-the-radar types!
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LSITilted4_5842.png]</p>
<p>Clint-Anglin&raquo;&gt; Unfortunately, Miramonte does not come with a medium weight {Steve Matteson if your listening&hellip;!}. <a href="http://www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/Miramonte.pdf">http://www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/Miramonte.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is why I used the bold weight. You are certainly right the bullets look weak. However I’m not too sure about the plus signs. Maybe a little too much.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture8_4601.png]</p>
<p>The left side has part plus signs and part bigger bullets&hellip; bigger bullets look better too. Umm&hellip; as for the alignment, I’m not sure where to go.</p>
<p>I also agree with you about having the contact info on both sides. I just think of all those business cards in a fish bowl at the counter of the chinese take-out. You know: “Put your card in for chance to win a free kung-pao bowl for two’. Most of what you see is blank white paper.</p>
<p>But I also agree with Haley that there is a lot redundancy on this card.</p>
<p>The back should be:</p>
<p>Laser Toner &amp; Inkjet Cartridges
Fax &amp; Copier Supplies
Inkjet &amp; Photo Paper
Printer Ribbons
Digital Photo Service
Printer Service &amp; Repair
Copier &amp; Printer Sales</p>
<p>Of course, I have wait for confirmation if he’ll go for that.</p>
<p>We’ll see. One down. Three to go.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah the cards from there are pretty decent quality. The matte finish I got on the last run hasn&rsquo;t had any scratching of the finish or anything. I always do the 4/4 Business Card option from that menu. (that means full colour on both sides)</p>
<p>The paper weight is pretty generic. It&rsquo;s a good stock for business cards. Not too flimsy or anything. I&rsquo;ve never had complaints from clients about it. Usually I don&rsquo;t even opt for a proof from them unless I&rsquo;m using some super specific colour that needs to be exact.</p>
<p>Annnd here is a good pool on flickr of super nice business card design :) Maybe you can find some inspiration for your list problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Miramonte does not come with a medium weight&hellip;.This is why I used the bold weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are you saying that the italic line is set in bold? It certainly doesn&rsquo;t look like it to me. How about going up a point size to help with the line weight?</p>
<p>Also, although it&rsquo;s a bit late to be bringing this up, doesn&rsquo;t the italic line logically belong at the bottom of the card after the list?</p>
