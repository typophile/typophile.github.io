body: "What, if any, accented characters (i.e., glyphs with diacritical marks such
  as Aacute or tcaron) are found in combinations that are commonly covered by ligatures?
  For example, c_t is a somewhat common ligature to include in well-rounded OpenType
  fonts. Would it also make sense to have c_tcaron or c_tbar? What about L_Aacute
  in an all-caps font that includes an L_A ligature?\r\n\r\nI am looking for guidance,
  because I'm just not yet familiar enough with some of the languages that use these
  diacritics. I would appreciate any help. Pointing out useful references on the topic
  would be especially helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks, all.\r\n\r\nTim"

    body: "Thanks. There's some good discussion there, but it's mostly around handling
      colliding accents. I'm more interested in ligatures coverage across languages.
      \r\n\r\nTaking c_t as an example: if I were to include a c_t ligature in a font
      and also wanted to provide glyphs across the Latin ranges, should I also then
      include ligatures for ccedilla_t, c_tcaron, c_tbar, etc.? I am not sure what
      combinations are even possible across all the different languages. I don't think
      ccedilla_t actually occurs in reality, so there would be no need to include
      such a ligature. I'm just not sure which combinations are possible.\r\n\r\nJust
      a few discretionary ligatures lead to a significant range of accented possibilities.
      Consider: s_t, c_t, o_o, s_p, T_h, L_A, N_N, R_A, T_T, T_Y....\r\n\r\nTim"
