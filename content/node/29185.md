  \r\n\r\nI just wondered what typeface is used for the University of Abertay identity
  at the final scene?\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated,\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nR."

    the font you want identified on this site somewhere?\r\nhttp://www.abertay.ac.uk/"

  body: "I appreciate your direction pattyfab, but I am aware of these facts, but
    because I don't have a sample or a link to a sample I could not post a link. Therefore
    I thought it may qualify for general discussion too. \r\n\r\nThe reason I mentioned
    the TV advert as the typeface in question doesn't appear anywhere on their website
    (if it did I would have posted the same link as yourself!)\r\n\r\nThanks anyway.\r\n\r\nCan
    anyone else help? If anyone has any sort of clue what I am talking about without
    a link, could it be Serifa?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/serifa-b/"

    the Matrixy video would it? Or perhaps the type at the end is the same but it
    is so broken up that iding it might be difficult.\r\nhttp://www.abertay.ac.uk/index.cfm?video=show&Key=000\r\n\r\nTim"
