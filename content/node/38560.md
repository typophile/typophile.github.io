  common with Futura, but it's an odd variation on the style. Note, the vertical cross
  of the Q. (Much like whatever the New  Yorker uses in their \"listings\" section.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mysteryletters_4392.gif]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sweaterthieves.com/uploaded_images/mysteryletters.gif\r\nonline

  Thanks for the title edit moderators. I'll work on that.\r\n"

    searches will probably only yield a million items related to the famous magazine's
    typography.\r\n\r\nOh well. This certainly helps.\r\n\r\nBest.\r\n\r\nJB"

  body: '''superficially resebles Futura'', understatement, lol. It even has the odd
    characters in Special No. 8, like that ''r''.'

  body: Yes, Stephen, thanks. I found one of those discussions while hunting around.
    So, another related question, how about that typeface that The New Yorker uses
    for their listings? Is that commercially available? Is it Vogue? It has the telltale
    Q.
