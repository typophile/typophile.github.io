  body: "Miss Tiffany, thanks for sure: Poynter is the name of a sponsor, and ties
    the series together for a particular document type, so it's not named with all
    the same intentions of most super families. (It does share the shopping advantages
    of a single name). And the other example, it's Petr's nickname, \"Pro\", so, that'
    more of a super designer issue. In addition to which, \"super\" in style is not
    nearly as important, to most clients, as super in offering high quality and fidelity
    over a wide variety of documents, technologies, and often languages.\r\n\r\nTake
    a look from another angle \u2014 99.99999% of the \"compatible\" families in the
    world are not \"super\". So choosing a compatible set by name (or designer for
    that matter), is something not entirely different from most likely incorrectly
    coloring-by-number. Because, is using a matched serif and sans at the same sizes
    over a range of matched sizes effective, \"optically\", without multiple masters?
    There's more design complexity along that line as well. So maybe not silly, but,
    it has gotten that way with at least one super family I know, and I see a much
    more creative world in \"the mixing\" than anything that uses this kind of matching.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yet, another way of looking at it, historically, how old is the need to match
    fonts? Very. And how old is the super-family concept? Not so old. So this is,
    perhaps, an important shopping issue for what is a relatively new class of purchaser,
    the less experienced designing user. But I don't think, in general, the best long
    term solution to this shopping issue is in the font name, though I'm not saying
    that you think so.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To understand: \"super\" implies, to you, as a family of serif and sans derived
    from the same structure? And Poynter is only named for a client, but not named
    for the genes? Not like, say, Meta Sans and Meta Serif or the latest Frutiger
    [Sans] and Frutiger Serif. \r\n\r\nI think you're right in that it is new for
    people to develop sans and serif from the same genes. And perhaps it is for a
    new kind of designer. But, I don't think it is only for them. If a type designer
    has an idea to design a serif and a sans from the same gene pool why does it have
    to be somehow wrong or bad? Why does it have to make the graphic designer lazy
    for wanting them and using them? True, part of the fun of being a designer is
    finding those unexpected font combinations that work. I love it when I find a
    few seemingly incompatible fonts and get them to work together. But, on the other
    hand, and as I've stated on another thread just yesterday, typeface selection
    is only a small part of the designer's battle. Even if a designer chooses to use
    a super family it doesn't mean the design will be successful. They still have
    to wrestle those fonts into a another structure using column width, white space,
    point size, color, etc. The battle could still be lost even with a super family
    on their team."

    Sometimes a simplicity is what you want and in those cases I thing a super family

    the people who have said that sometimes a super family is a solution without a
    problem having been made along too theoretical a line, and as such isn't a good
    fit for much. Sorry I can't recall who it was that said this. So perhaps it's
    not a question of the SuperF per se, that can be less than ideal, so much as the
    process/thinking that went into it making it. Which, when I think about it seems
    like the old old story when it comes to type."

    Apart from the Design/Writing/Reseach book that uses the Scala & Sans family well,
    I have never really seen any of the other super families used together. It's usually
    part of it used with something entirely different. Perhaps the reason folks like
    to buy super families like Meta/Meta Serif is that the same (desired) design qualities
    are present in the sans and the serif, making it useful for a variety of applications.
    Also, purchasing the old super family together is generally cheaper than purchasing
    separately. Who knows!\r\n\r\nBesides the issue of super families is the ever-expanding
    'single' typeface, with a million weights and widths, like <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/TitlingGothicFB\">Titling
    Gothic FB</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/serif/ModernoFB/styles\">Moderno.</a>
    I suppose MM or Superpolator makes this easy, but is it desirable? Do your customers
    dig this sort of thing, David?\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

    Absolutely. In fact, if I were a user needing fonts, knowing what I know about
    use, I would go for a double density array of a single family (for display), before
    a super family. Then, I'd buy something compatible that contained grades, for
    text.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that there is no common use to be made of super
