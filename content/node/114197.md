body: "hello,\r\n\r\nmy magazine uses bembo for body copy, which i find a bit dated
  and better for book copy.\r\n\r\ncan anyone please recommend a more modern serif
  that works for body copy? Perhaps a little cleaner than Bembo.\r\n\r\nI am considering
  paring it with Museo (headlines) throughout the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe magazine has
  a dated look, so just looking for something more modern with a little more weight
  than Bembo, I find it light, wide and antiquated.\r\n\r\nIf you know of anything
  great, don't be afraid to suggest what it might pair with for headlines etc...\r\n\r\nI
  really appreciate any suggestions. Looking forward to some feedback.\r\n"

    thing you could do is go to a bookstore and look through a few magazines, and
    find ones whose body text you like and that you think would be suitable for your
    layout, client and readers.\r\nYou don\u2019t have to copy the fonts or setting
    exactly, but it will help focus your thinking."

  body: "thanks for your inquiry.\r\n\r\nMagazine is on the international media -
    television \r\n\r\nreadership is pretty large - worldwide - thousands - audience
    is mostly businesses & executives \r\n\r\nIt tends to be pretty type heavy, illustrations
    are not much, we tend to use large photos.\r\n\r\nI am the new art director and
    I am really looking to upgrade the look and feel. We use too many fonts and the
    look is dated. I am looking for outside opinions and expertise, we can tend to
    be a bit insular.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
