  suggested this site as a resource. If anyone has suggestions on companion fonts
  for Mrs. Eaves I would greatly appreciate the help. Also if you have any alternative/
  similar font suggestions. Thanks!

    love? Your hypersensitive idolatry of Licko is quite strange, especially at your
    age, especially a decade after it's no longer fashionable. And I know how important
    fashion is to you. But most of all I think it's misplaced because your work is
    better!\r\n\r\nThe war is over if you want it? I guess you don't want it. To me,
    the war is natural, it just has to be balanced. And most of all, when you see
    something good/bad enough to point out, you do so. Mrs Eaves is a prominent font,
    so it naturally gets extra attention; the more it's used by indiscriminating designers,
    the more people like me will point out the beautiful blonde's speech impediment.\r\n\r\nCommercially
    successful? Maybe I should become a prostitute.\r\nBut then I can't have people

  body: It seems most if not all the Emigre fonts are very loosely spaced. I don't
    have a problem with that at relatively small text sizes. I site Visa and Tarzana
    as examples. If I need to use them at larger text sizes its really not a problem
    in either Illustrator or InDesign to use the option/left arrow key combination
    to tighten up the spacing.

    A good reason for that would be that customers would have hated the resultant
    reflow of any old documents. A bad reason would be hubris.\r\n\r\nGrant, TUG's
    Baskerville will be: freely available; freely modifiable (with some provisions
    concerning \"officialness\"); and a mix of convention in the Roman and innovation
    (blasphemy?) in the Italic (but don't fear, it's not a slanted-roman or anything).\r\n\r\nThomas,
    last year I left the top of my convertible (the one I had before this one - remind
    me to tell you the story of how the previous one died) open day-and-night (no
    garage) for 13 weeks straight. And when you turn on the heater, isn't the feeling
    of hot air rising and dissipating from your feet to your (cold) head just surreal?\r\n\r\n>
    is there a good way to set Mrs. Eaves?\r\n\r\nAbout 18 point, one line at a time,
    spaced manually.\r\n\r\n> I would have thought the best companion for Mrs Eaves
    would be Mr Eaves?\r\n\r\nYou mean Richard? The bastard jumped ship.\r\nBut Mr
    Richard would still be a great name for a font.\r\n\r\nTiff, Sarah was still married
    when she started living with JB.\r\nBut probably because divorce law in the UK
    back then was nasty.\r\nOn the other hand, I'm all for discouraging divorce to
    some\r\nextent: it makes marriage more serious. Anyway, as you were.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
