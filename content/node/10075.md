  display, I mean, it&#39;s very close to my handwriting but like my handwriting doesn&#39;t
  work in large blocks of text.   <BR>it&#39;s kind of a font for the backs of photos.   <BR>   <BR>please
  this is only my second font, I am struggling with the office copy of fontographer
  &#40;is there a way to add guides? or change the guide for the decender?&#41;   <BR>   <BR>I&#39;m
  still debating the kerning, my writing is very spaced out &#40;like the alphabet
  sample but for the sake of convention I tightened it up and i&#39;m not sure i like
  it as much.   <BR>   <BR>Enough babble, on with the show:   <BR><a href="http://jen.f1-comics.com/ifalphabet.jpg"

  body: I&#39;d like to see more consistency in the swashes. The truly great calligraphers
    like Ismar David make their swashes an element that unifies the script, and in
    your sample they seem to clash. I&#39;d suggest drawing out dozens of different
    versions of each letter and picking the ones that are the most harmonious.
