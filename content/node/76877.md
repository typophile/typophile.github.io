  I came upon this website.  I saw many great postings, so I decided to see if anyone
  could possibly help me find pictures of the font in a very early bible from Italy,
  from Rome or the surrounding area if possible.  I just need a few pictures, so I
  can have my artist draw from them.  I am getting the 23rd psalm written out across
  my chest, and I wish to have the most accurate font possible.  Thanks all!"

  body: As it happens I'm reading Fred Smeijers' Counterpunch at the moment, and there's
    a very nice example of Pierre Haultin's (French, not Italian) Nonpareille Romaine,
    a 6 pt roman punchcut from 1557, originally made for bibles. Alternatively you
    might want to look in to Francesco Griffo (Italian), who around 1499 cut the basis
    for what later became Bembo.
