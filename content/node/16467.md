body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMany years ago we developed some 'hacked' fonts for several Native
  American languages with Fontographer. With more unicode and OpenType support for
  OSX and WinXP we're looking at re-developing fonts the right way. I've been reading
  about the issues and processes and am using FontLab and Ukelele on the Mac and the
  WinXP keyboard tool on PC. I've visited with the folks at languagegeek to see how
  they're approaching the topic. I've read a number of Adam T's posts and am evaluating
  the various alternatives.  \r\n\r\nThe environment...\r\n1. The tribal culture committees
  are looking for word processing, desktop publishing, possible web development and
  possible database work. It appears that we need to point ourselves to InDesign.\r\n2.
  The documents need to be cross-platform for distribution to schools and various
  departments.\r\n3. The culture committees are fairly specific about the character
  styles and they may differ somewhat from standard linguistic stylings and namings.\r\n4.
  One language has approximately 60 characters and the other approximately 45.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I've found so far...\r\n1. Creating a composite glyph, with a non-defined PUA unicode
  index, doesn't seem to be supported by some Mac Apps (including Ukelele for associating
  the character to a key).\r\n2. Using combining diacriticals (acute) with space modifiers
  (small 'w'...which we call 'rounded') doesn't appear to work properly in Mellel
  spell checking but seems to work OK in NeoOffice. In Mellel it sees the small 'w'
  as a new word character.\r\n3. Positioning in FontLab doesn't appear to be two dimensional,
  so I tried the OT ccmp feature. However, that doesn't appear to be supported in
  some Mac Apps.\r\n4. Some of the characters we need are at U+2C60 and up, but don't
  seem to be assigned to a UniCode range. I see them in the OSX charater palette but
  not the FL4.5 ranges.\r\n\r\nPotential direction...\r\n1. Use combining diacriticals
  and space modifiers (and don't use PUA) to better support spell checking and the
  most number of apps. Live with poorer typographical displays.\r\n2. Use pre-composed
  characters where available to support mutilple diacriticals\r\n3. Use NeoOffice/Open
  Office for word processing and InDesign for DTP.\r\n\r\nQuestions...\r\n1. Which
  OpenType features can we use that are supported by the most OSX and PC apps?\r\n2.
  Any suggestions on improving cross-platform typographic quality without using PUA
  and substitution?\r\n3. Is there a way to support apps that don't use OT well and
  those that do? In other words, how can base support be provided using combining
  diacriticals and spacing modifiers and also provide advanced positioning and ccmp
  features for apps that use it and still maintain cross-platform/document support?\r\n\r\nAny
  hints, tips or suggestions are appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    on the topic. So you are familiar with all the pros and contras of the various
    approaches. All I can say is that your issue is a tough call. \r\n\r\nOne thing
    you might be looking at is including both OpenType Layout features and AAT features
    in your font. Mac OS X 10.3 and earlier only support AAT features. Mac OS X 10.4.3
    and later support both OpenType Layout features and AAT features. (Mac OS X 10.4.0-10.4.2
    had a problem with fonts that contained both types of features.) \r\n\r\nYou will
    find information about adding AAT tables at: \r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/fonts/\r\n\r\nRegards,
    \r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n "

    body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\nCan FontLab handle both OpenType and AAT in the same font?
      Or, will I need to create the OpenType work first in Fontlab and then use the
      AAT Font Tool?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nFred"

    going to an awful lot of trouble to try to produce a cross-platform solution when
    a more realistic option would be to make conformant OpenType fonts for Windows
    XP and Office XP, and stick with hack fonts for the other users - Mac, Linux,
    and Win 9x? I'd guess you could even use Python Script to generate the good vs
    evil fonts from the same sources.\r\n\r\nSi\r\n"

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nTo quote the eminent stooge Curley, \"I'm thinkin' and thinkin'
      as hard as I can and nothin's happening!\"\r\n\r\nThe goal is to produce Native
      American language documents on both OSX and PCs that can be shared both ways.
      The next goal is to build support for spell checking. The primary applications
      are desktop publishing and word processing. I also need to create a utility
      to convert documents with older 'hacked ascii' fonts to unicode.\r\n\r\nI'm
      still working on a single font. I'm tending towards using combining diacriticals
      with space modifying letters. It appears that the features of AAT do not appear
      to be usable with the recent OpenType changes to OSX 10.4. I guess we'll just
      live with lower quality typography until more of the OpenType features are supported.\r\n\r\nAt
      the present time I'm trying to better understand how Ukelele works with combining
      diacriticals to know if our goals are achievable. I'm also diving into Applescript
      to see how conversion to unicode will work.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nFred\r\n\r\n"
