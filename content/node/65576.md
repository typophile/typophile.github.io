body: "A 15\" MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nMy biggest beef so far is that the glass touch pad
  just isn't as slidy as the plastic one on my old PC laptop. I'm gonna get a blister
  on y finger. I just know it.\r\n\r\nAside from that insurmountable issue, I have
  to partition the drive & load windows to run some of my old windows aps and get
  at some of my old files. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? Can I just use \"Bootcamp\", or
  as I have been told, do I have to install something like Parallel?\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: If you don't mind having to restart between using Windows and Mac OS, bootcamp
    is the easiest (and cheapest option). Parallels runs Windows within a Mac OS window.
    It seemed a bit complex for me when I needed it, so I just used Bootcamp. I found
    it reasonably easy to set up [[http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/|Apple's]]

    should be of more help with this sort of question than Typophile.\r\nThat said,
    in my understanding it mostly depends how you intend to use the 2 systems. I'd
    say Parallels is more flexible if your workflow involves some Windows programs
    \u2013 being able to run Windows and OSX \xABside by side\xBB, and copy-paste
    between them etc. is pretty nice. If OTOH the stuff you do on Windows stuff is
    not so \xABinterlocked\xBB with a Mac-based workflow, so rebooting is not a PITA,
    Bootcamp should work out fine."

    access half of your RAM, and half your CPU in each OS. If you boot to Windows
    through Boot Camp, this isn't a problem. Don't know what software you plan on
    running, but I run AutoCAD and SolidWorks on my Mac/Windows machine, so having
    only half the RAM is not an option. I'm still running Tiger and Boot Camp Beta
    however (I couldn't tell you the last time I booted into OS X), so this restriction
    may no longer exist -- however I can't imagine that. \r\n\r\nYou might also look
    at Sun's Virtual Box for a VM solution. Hard to beat price-wise."

  body: "<em>...you can only access half of your RAM, and half your CPU in each OS.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm
    pretty sure it doesn't work that way. \r\n\r\nMac OS X uses dynamically allocated
    virtual memory. Each app (including virtual machines) can take as much memory
    as they need. The hard disk will be used if there isn't enough physical RAM available,
    mainly for inactive apps, but even for the active ones if necessary. You can't
    allocate more RAM on your virtual Windows machine than is installed on your Mac,
    and you will definitely run into performance problems if you allocate the maximum
    (a couple hundred MB less than the installed physical RAM), but short of that,
    it's no different than using any other app.\r\n\r\nAlso, unless you are using
    some other app that is hogging the CPU, Windows will get all the CPU it asks for,
    again, just like any other app."

  body: "Perhaps new versions of Parallels are different, but I'm fairly certain that
    older versions did split your CPU in half. One core for OS X, the other core for
    Windows. Though I haven't looked into running Windows as a VM under OS X in 2
    years or so. No doubt other VM solutions don't impose this restriction, and I
    wouldn't be surprised if newer versions of Parallels didn't either. Nor would
    I be surprised if I was totally misinformed about older versions of Parallels.\r\n\r\nIn
    retrospect, the 'half your RAM' crap I was told was probably just a rule-of-thumb
    for standard 2GB RAM MBPs. 1GB for each OS to avoid going into the harddrive swap
    that Mark mentioned. At any rate, doing 3D modeling on a VM doesn't make much
    sense to me -- nor does re-licensing all my software for OS X -- so it's been
    Bootcamp all the way.\r\n\r\nAnd I will say that the only bad experience I've
    had with Bootcamp is related to the battery driver. Again, no doubt fixed in newer
    releases. But if you decide to go with Bootcamp, and your CPU usage in Windows
    jumps to 100% and everything goes to pot -- before you're tempted to throw your
    computer against the wall, disable the ACPI-Compliant battery driver. If that
    'fixes' things, re-enable the driver, reboot into OS X, reboot into Windows, and
    everything should be coming-up-roses."

  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nFirstly I would recommend you Parallels as a solution for not
    too resource demanding tasks. It runs fast and smooth and file-exchange between
    the systems are easily done. Bootcamp I use sooo rarely, like once every 4 months
    when I play a game for an hour or two. That is the only reason I can imagine one
    could need Bootcamp for, if you don't use things like CAD or other heavy programs.
    \r\n\r\nSecondly, I like macs, I own one, but: Give it back now! And buy a new
    MacBook Pro in a month from now, a new CPU generation from Intel is arriving,
    Codename arrandale, and it will increase performance very noticeable, especially
    tasks which can't make use of a multi-core processor, the performance of a single
    core is boosted up quite a bit. Plus maybe apple drops price, or adds a bigger
    hard drive, more memory, or does some other make-over... more value for the same
    money. But this is just a personal opinion ;) Do as you please. ;) With SuperDuper!
    (free for basic function) You could make a bootable backup of your harddrive and
    copy it back with the migration assistant (OS X onboard application) once you
    have your new mac. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFlo\r\n\r\n "
