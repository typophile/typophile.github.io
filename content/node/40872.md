body: "Hiya\r\n\r\nI would love some feedback on the logo for Headfood.\r\nHeadfood
  is the new canteen for Vega the Brand Communication School. Vega is South Africa's
  premium school of design and branding. The idea is for the canteen to create food
  culture activities. It is the opposite of fast food and we want people to cerebrate
  their food (correct spelling - cerebral + celebrate ). The basic premise is that
  good food please all the sense and thereby \r\nstimulate the minds of young designers
  and innovators. The canteen will combine good natural food with technology like
  fingerprint identification for account holders and a beautiful stark interior.\r\n\r\nI
  used Joshua Darden's great Omnes font for the logo. Any feedback - spacing, legibility?
  I plan to use Omnes for all Menu boards and associated communication, and would
  like to laser cut the logo out of thick wood at the entrance.\r\n \r\nplease help?\r\n\r\neben\r\n\r\n"

    want to create a stand-alone type version for some applications, but, then again,
    this *is* a design school, so it's probably good as-is."

  body: "Nice and fun!\r\n\r\nSorry, slightly off subject, but it reminded me of this
    old liquorice bar logo (only the face is old, obviously). It caused a lot of grief
    here in Finland, since it was considered racist first by a British MP.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lakrits_1169242020_5850.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.the-latest.com/politician-backs-ban-on-sambo-image\r\n"
