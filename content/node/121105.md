  is a display family of five typographic layers with a retro feeling. They could
  be stacked upon each other or could be used separately. Genplan Pro is based on
  the lettering in the title of the general plan of Moscow of 1935. It supports all
  European languages including Greek, and many Cyrillic languages including the Asian
  ones. It has uppercase and small-caps letters.\r\n\r\nIt also includes currency
  signs for Russian Rouble, Ukrainan Hryvnia and Kazakh Tenge. It has many alternate
  glyphs, Ukrainian regular ligatures, discretionary ligatures, language based alternates
  for Polish (the kreska), Albanian (the shape of J) and Bulgarian (triangular \u0414
  and \u041B).\r\n\r\nAs a typeface designed for display purposes, it\u2019s great
  for use in logos and headlines\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thundertype/genplan-pro/|Get
