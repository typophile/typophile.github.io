  body: I doubt very much that&#39;s a font in the traditional sense but rather a
    paint stencil &#40;the stencil may not have had been developed from a typeface&#41;.
    However, here are some suggestions that may help. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/feliciano/bs-looper/regular-stencil/testdrive.html?s=KEEP+CLEAR&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">BS Looper regular</a> is similar. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bank-stencil/ef-medium/testdrive.html?s=KEEP+CLEAR&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Bank Stencil</a> is less similar but in the same style. <BR> <BR>What
    movie is that capture from?
