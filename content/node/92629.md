  right now. I'm creating the font in Glyphs (it's a really great app, very smooth).\r\nLet
  me know what you think.\r\nI was shooting for a Bold or Demi Condensed. I've called
  it bold for now.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\ndglen\r\n\r\nUC:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/3d273X132J2u1N0m3H1t\r\n\r\nlc:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0M452e351L3K0Q1p1n0V"

  body: "I don't know why the \"S\" thinks the \"R\" smells bad :-) because it's my
    favorite glyph - in fact I think you could [re]think everything around that \"R\".
    And the \"a\" might do the same for the lc.\r\n\r\nI don't get why the \"h\" and
    \"g\" are short (although the other descenders might in fact be too long).\r\n\r\nBTW,
    could you explain your \"horizontal width relations\" angle?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "hrant\r\n\r\nYou have a good eye. The h was an oversite. You look at these
    things for so long that after awhile that you literally don't see some obvious
    errors.\r\n\r\nThe \"S\" is somewhat in the same boat. I'll have to check but
    it might be a different version than I had in mind.\r\nSo skip the \"S\", skip
    the \"h\". The font is like and old typewriter with two broken keys.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the horizontal width of the characters. I'm using a book called \"Designing Type\"
    by Karen Cheng as a sort of textbook. She really goes into detail as to the size
    of characters. I've learned a lot.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't make sense it's not worth
    belaboring. It does make sense to me but I may not be able to properly articulate
    the idea.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\ndglen"

    volume in a series... and volume one -where one learns the basics of type design-
    has yet to be written.  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Do you have a couple other books that you think are useful? I'm really
      interested in the mechanical aspects of creating fonts. There are quite a few
      books on general type design (at least I'm pretty sure there are).\r\n\r\nWhat
      I need is a book or two similar to Cheng's. One where specific relations between
      letters are spelled out. I know such things vary per font but Cheng did a pretty
      good job of distilling each letter in relation to their case and other characters.\r\n\r\nI
      don't need how to's on software, that's easy, just suggestions, if you have
      any, on books like Chengs.\r\n\r\ndglen"
