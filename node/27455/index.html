		<div class="commentbody">I'm no expert on the publishing biz, but generally doesn't the publisher pick the font (maybe in consultation with the author) and they likely have access to a bunch of quality text faces to choose from. I'm sure they can provide a list. 

So as you're picking the font, I can only conclude that you're talking about the font for the manuscript that's being passed to publishers as you tout the work, or that you're self publishing. In either case the requirement of a free font (as opposed to a cheap quality font) seems very strange. I assume you put in many hundreds of hours into the novel, so why not present it in the best possible way? I'm sure people can think of other parallels but to me its kind of like a master brewer, spending many years to prefect a fine ale, only to present it at competition in a discarded milk bottle. Free fonts have their place - quickie projects, rave flyers, birthday invites - but using them for something you poured your heart and soul into just seems a bit sad. 

Maybe the subject material requires a free font? I suppose a book on <A HREF="http://www.areasofmyexpertise.com/">hobo matters</A> or scifi conference attendees may benefit from a 2nd or 3rd rate type.

		<div class="commentbody">Sii: Actually, that's a funny thing. See, the novel is for a book that will be published in my community and distributed at some creative writing fair, for a price. It's kind of like a self-publishing press with few profits, I guess. After that, I'm going to submit the manuscript. Sorry I didn't explain it. Anyway, the community asked ME to make sure it's "ready for the public", and then they're going to print it... I'm kind of lost too, but I know I have to do this. :P.

As for quality fonts that won't break the bank (at all),
I recommend:

Gentium (this one's a real beauty, but no small caps . . . yet)

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium

I'm surprised this font is free. Alot of work went into it.

Also have a look at Cardo. I think it sets a bit too light on a laser or inkjet, but have a go with it.

http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html

Day Roman is another possibility.

http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=day_roman

It should be noted, however, that there are a multitide of well-crafted and versatile fonts that are relatively inexpensive, and as such, are entirely worth the money. A good font very likely isn't something you'll use just once. You'll use it over and over again, and if you're truly happy with it, you'll find excuses to use it whenever you can (and whenever appropriate, of course.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there:

Just a question. What operating system are you using? If you are using a mac, then you don't need to buy fonts perse. You can use Mac OS X's excellent system fonts. Hoefler Text being one of the most elegant type familes ever is perfect for your needs.

But if you are a non-mac user and your system fonts are not so hot then you CAN use a few good free fonts for serious fine typography.

As mentioned earlier, Gentium is a fine choice and it has nothing even close to the feeling of free. It's a high quality font. This font won a Type Directors Club award (very prestigious) and it's a pretty good choice for basic book work. I'm sure of you set a piece in Gentium your collegues will remark how prefessional your work looks. 

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/render_download.php?site_id=nrsi&format=file&media_id=Gentium_RU_spec&filename=Gentium_RU_spec.pdf

Another...
http://www.greekfontsociety.org/pages/en_typefaces.html 

The Greek Font Soceity has many classic looking typefaces for free that are suitable for book work. Their greek fonts have been recommended in the book "The Elements of Typographic Style"... which is considered the typographic 'bible' by some. So the romans might be worth a try.

And finally, you need to check this website every month:
http://www.fontshop.com/features/free.cfm

The fonts that FONTSHOP gives away are high quality (sometimes award winning) commercial fonts- that are can be 'pricey'. You can save lots of money by visting that site every month. In a few months your can build an nice library of type without spending a dime. And despite the negative attitude some have toward free fonts, everyone participating in this forum checks the FontShop site religously to get the goods. Just recently they gave away Meta Book- something I would have NEVER purchased (boring) and Sanuk Fat which I like (quirky and tough at the same time) but probably would not get either. I have since been using them together and I really do love them now. AND NOW THAT FONTSHOP HAS ME ROPED IN, I'M GOING TO BUY MORE WEIGHTS OF BOTH VERY SOON... sometimes free is bad- it makes you poor. :-)

But David, I do recommend you invest in a 'proper' commercial type system suited to your needs. This garantees you have a consistant look that enables you to do anything you want typographically. There are many award winning high quality type famillies for south of $200. (Relato, Atlantica, Alinea etc- I think 170 is the sweet spot) And many less than $100. Tyrnavia is full featured type system great for setting text. Its only $49 comes loaded with ligatures and ornaments... no bold weight but you can get around that.

You can differentiate yourself (your style, your work) by investing a little at time. 

Take for example Linotype Really. I love this type familly but I can't purchase the whole thing right now... so what do I do? Since its only $22 a font and there are only four weights sold through Linotype. (BTW... don't discredit the large foundrys as always expensive- they have deals all the time.) I can get one font this week and may be one next week and so on and so on till I have the whole Really collection from Linotype. Or you contrast types the are free and commercial. Lets say I used Gentium for text and Poetica or Penumbra for headlines or subheads.

Anyhow don't feel bad (or let anyone else make you feel bad) that your broke. No one else is gonna take care of you except for you. I think if you plan carefully and use the right combination of types (free or otherwise) your new book will be memorably beautiful.


All my best to you,


Mike Diaz</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I recently came across this: <a href="http://www.jfdoom.altervista.org/fonts.php">JFDooM Flanker's fonts</a>. Some of those fonts seem to have potential and aren't ripoffs of commercial font files.

All the bolds look a little artificially done to me, and that's why I've only downloaded the regular and italic versions. "Griffo FLNK" is especially nice at the first look. "Imperator" is his own design and is a positive surprise for a free font.

It's worth mentioning, though, that they may have some technical problems similar to Cardo.

Anyway, I'd use these ones for display use only. For more display fonts with potential, I recommend browsing through <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/">Manfred Klein</a> (can be frustrating at times).</div>
