  what I'm, looking for.\r\n\r\nMy story is that I work for a part of the Salvation
  Army in Australia and we have an internal LMS with a logo designed by my old boss.
  \ He left and we need to update things.  I'm not sure I like the logo itself, but
  I need to update it with new colours and also some extra text.\r\n\r\nAll I have
  is the gif (which includes a mortar board on one of the letters), so I hope someone
  can help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"
