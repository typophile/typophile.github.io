  would like to use zero indent after cyan subhead, and 3-4 after first paragraph.
  \r\n\r\nCannot find any simple solution.\r\n\r\nCan nested styles help here?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Probably the easiest way is to set up separate styles for the first paragraph
    and then subsequent ones, and to ensure they are threaded properly (i.e. the cyan
    subhead references the following style as "first paragraph" and "first paragraph"
    notes "subsequent paragraphs").
