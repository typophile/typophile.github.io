body: Hello, <BR> <BR>this is my first typeface and it&#39;s based on the idea of
  cutting one shape out of another. I thought it would be a fairly simple typeface
  to start-off with because of this simplicity and I&#39;m fairly happy with the results
  so far. I wanted the typeface to have a futuristic funk &#40;a la Parliament, George
  Clinton, P-Funk etc&#41; vibe to it. Something that would be displayed on the side
  of their Interstellar Time-Travellin&#39; Funkmobile in the year 3030 &#40;hence
  the name&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve found the typeface starts lookin pretty &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;
  once you have more than 4 letters in the word which kinda sucks. I may just be paranoid
  though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: 'Just an idea: Maybe you should try to direct the &#39;movement&#39; of the
    letters in one, ehm, direction. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m making myself clear,
    but that way you&#39;d be able to read longer words.'

  body: Tim, I like it a lot.  <BR>I like the rythem of the openings in the font once
    going left, then right. I dont think you should bother about long words or texts.
    But that&#39;s only my personal opinion.  <BR> <BR>How about the numerals? <BR>
    <BR>I like the G, J and R. <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: Hi Tim <BR> <BR>Have a look at this font, Phucy. You&#39;ll see that the designer
    has done a regular, but also positive, regular and shaded. I&#39;d look at doing
    a shaded and ouline version of your font. Also apply it to some stuff to get the
    motivation back. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15169.gif"

  body: 'Q bothers me, the neg/pos thing - I think there could be a better solution
    for it that is in keeping with the rest of your forms.  <BR> <BR>the anti-serif
    thing &#40;what would you call it?&#41; on the top left corners is fun but I figure
    it needs to be consistant in shape,size and depth throughout.  <BR> <BR>I also
    feel that your pill shape that makes most of the counters should be the same in
    width, and then you could play with the positioning to make up contrast. Looking
    at the neg space of U,V,W makes it confusing to see what kind of transition in
    going on there: <BR> <BR>i.e.  <BR>U,O,D,T don&#39;t seem to have any. <BR>H,R,X,V,K
    seem to have it.  <BR> <BR>why e? <BR>'
