body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am looking for the font seen in the image below. It reminds
  a bit of DIN but the M for example is different.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/movembercom_4182.jpg]\r\n\r\nUnforunately
  I haven't found any better photos of the text so far. The curvature is due to the
  titles being applied to the front of a Boeing aircraft.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help.\r\n\r\nKind
  regards,\r\nChristian"

    the nose section, haven't seen that one yet.\r\n\r\nI think I'll go for Franchise
    Bold, looks like an interesting font. Mechanic Gothic is noteworthy too.\r\n\r\nBest
