In the way of printing I mean.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know if I am that person either. But I did do a broadside once called Murder in the Printshop that used your Caslon 337 letterpress. Sent you a copy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Currently, whether I am that person or not, I am printing a book on Joseph Moxon. He said something and I respond. Sort of like an e-mail conversation, except completely under my control!!! Was great fun until I started printing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My last book project with metal was around 1998, I think. Started using photopolymer in 1991.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Photopolymer is just a great printing surface; with a platemaking machine it's like having your own Monotype caster but not being limited to Monotype. And desktop publishing software and digital type is a blessing, is now and has been for some many years. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, yeah, Moxon will be prohibitively expensive. About a grand. When you are printing a book with a hand-operated press and using handmade paper that cost $7.50 a sheet, and it sucks up a couple years of your life, yeah, it gets expensive. On our last book, a speculative book on the proof of Gutenberg, I think my partner and I spent around $70,000 on a book that was printed in an edition of 146 copies. Now that's a risky investment when you are not making a book that is intentionally directed at any market whatsoever. More like, this is what we want to do and this is what we have to do, so let's get down on our knees and pray.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basically, just an idiotic career choice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A wish-we-could book currently in research stage is on the 16th century astronomer Tycho Brahe!!! A very interesting and strange and important fellow. We will have a lot of fun with this one. Well, at least, initially. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

First person, at the age of 12 or something to look at the stars holding the first printed ancient star maps and realizing they were wrong. Is able to prove this. Loses his nose in a sword fight over who is the best mathematical student. First scientist to use the printing press to print his work, papermill and all. Trains the great Dutch printer and scientific publisher, Willem Janszoon Blaeu. First to establish what we now call a scientific research facility. The King of Denmark gives him his own island and he imprisons the inhabitants. Has a couple of dwarfs for entertainment. Invents running water for the sole purpose of a practical joke on unsuspecting visitors. Has a jail under his castle. Never lets an apprentice leave the island, ever. Invents all his own instruments, of which their were very very many. His entire castle revolves to follow the movements of the stars. Contributes significantly to astronomy; on his death bed he gives his apprenctice Kepler all his data. Dies from mercury poisoning associated with the several hundred false noses he had.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see what you see, only I read it differently. I see cleaning out the corners. The metal must be clean or it will not relieve when cast. It will &quot;hold&quot; when the type is removed. What I can see is evidence of gravure slippage, or manipulation error on the top crotch of the &quot;h&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the &quot;b&quot; if your theory was correct the punchcutter has lost control. Please draw your eye to the top bowel-crotch of the ascending stem. Either the top crotch is an error, or the bottom crotch an error? Take your pick. There is no need for one without the other. If you take issue to the nature of stems and placement compare the situation on the companion areas of the &quot;d&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So no more yeah buts . . . please! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If &quot;ink trapping&quot; were &quot;the intention&quot; the application &quot;should be even&quot;. His work, as you can easily see, is not that fussy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or, lots of theory, little ability to apply.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meaning this artifact lends little support to your hypothesis. If he is cutting ink trapping intentionally he should have enough skills to apply his principals evenly throughout. I am not disparaging the beauty of his letterforms in fact the cut-look-&amp;-feel is integral to the very beauty. The crudeness is in effect, much more than secondary to the design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But &quot;ink trapping&quot;, come come. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These letters are much as if they were cut in linoleum or wood. Those are the characteristics which come easily when using similar tools such as a gravure. There are large and small gravures. Tools, including needles are used in small point sizes or tight areas. These cuts are &quot;humongoumamouth&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at these letterforms I see forms worked by mostly a single gravure, large by type cutting standards. Certainly it, possibly them, would be used only in the crudest of work when cutting an 8 pt. character. Probably, not even then.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The very nature of these letterforms does not required fine gravures. The large gravure(s) have given the design the intended emotions of the designer. Cutting emotions. I suggest a more finished look  would have greatly reduced its appeal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you view the crotch in the Q you will see a place where it would &quot;certainly deserve&quot; the &quot;ink trap treatment&quot; you refer to &quot;if the punchcutter believed as you&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see a punchcutter seeking a-cut-look-&amp;-feel to his letterforms, and getting it. Forgiving people such as yourselves for mistaking them to be either faults, or &quot;in your(s) case(s)&quot; inktraps in order to achieve the characteristic nature of the letterforms that have drawn our attentions. By the way, which because of the tooling, are acidly beautiful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have to love it for what it is, not for what you want it to be. You should remember that boys, and the girls shall be forever thankful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is an acid sharpness throughout, and I suspect lots of &quot;gravure&quot;, little &quot;file&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a general crudeness throughout and if you notice the &quot;h&quot; has another mis-cutting on the top left curve. Also if you view the beard of the same character you will see a flatness on the lower portions of the gravure straightening into perpendicular at the top of the stroke meeting close to the same error. He is giving a lot of meaning to free handing and that I believe issues much of the beauty of this particular typeface.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I highly recommend that some of you consider cutting types yourselves. The impossibility is merely an obstacle in your minds. But remember, there is few of us left.

Look at the trapping in DTL Fleischmann, a digital face where there is no graver to slip: it's all over the place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, Pascal is not a &quot;crude&quot; face, intentionally or otherwise.

So it was not an aesthetic decision on the part of the designer himself (and hopefully the punchcutter didn't make any aesthetic decisions on his own, certainly not at the larger sizes!), it was a technical decision on the part of the punchcutter.

How would this have affected the role of the pantograph? And coming around to that issue I wanted to one day approach you with, how might Benton's so-called &quot;cutting slips&quot; (mentioned in Rehak's book) be relevant here?

But a good punchcutter (or the pantograph?) would be able to reduce/eliminate this effect, no? I have many questions - much to learn&hellip; Where exactly do you see the effects of this phenomenon you describe in the Pascal 60? Maybe in the fact that the &quot;b&quot; has a much deeper cut than the &quot;d&quot;? It might be important here to state explicitly that the scan has been flipped horizontally, for easy decipherment of the letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it also seems like some shapes have symmetrical cuts (both with respect to their flanking sides as well as with respect to the location on the letterform), irrespective of cutting direction. And also, some shapes (not necessarily the ones I've scanned) are missing traps/nicks where I would expect to see some - these are generally secondary ones, like the asterisk, but sometimes it seems like they just forgot (which also happens in digital too, like in the DTL Fleishmann I mentioned). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The 12 point appears natural <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It has a huge trap! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And remember, that was a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->print<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I ask again whether the type was cut and then &quot;electroplated&quot; or just &quot;punched&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would have to ask Henk Gianotten, who used to work for Tetterode before they went under. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Font le Roy, San Francisco you will see sparkling &quot;ink trapless&quot; type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Could you elaborate on this? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

I was unaware of that, however I previously suspected he wrote a smallish note. Now I think I was wrong, perhaps. Hmm, the feeling seems to be a weak feeling. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Someone other than myself should invite him to participate. He mistakenly thinks you have to be a member of ATPi. My inviting him would not have the impact of your inviting him. After all, I suspect I may have outworn my welcome.

He has his own opinions, his own observations which are his alone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also I reserve the right to disagree with him. I am, after all, as you may have noticed, a disagreeable sort of fellow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->***** <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is the e-mail he sent me. I trust he has no objection. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've been following your intense messaging back and forth with Hrant Papazian about the ink-trapping situation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am certain that no such thing existed in metal type. I certainly recall that in using your comparator to re-drawe letters for you from your Lanston punches that just the reverse was true. In the corners and pinches, the shapes were terminated with a small radius, because of the revolving cutter on the pantograph. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that Lanston did not deem it necessary to hand-nick out these tight spots. You and I both know that a person can print with no problem with Monotype type. It's all in the hand of the pressman that scoops the ink out of the can. A little bit goes a long way. I don't think it has ever been the responsibility of the type  manufacturer or punch cutter to try to anticipate with how much vigor and enthusiasm the pressman applies the ink. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since I am not a member of ATypI I cannot get involved in the forum. Perhaps that is a good thing. There is slittle to be gained from getting heated about a thing like that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I finally got finished with the job of cutting flat mat accents for 18 point Nicholas Cochin for Lucy lambert, and am now involved in the alignment and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fitting of the 14 point Cartier Roman font that I cut 14 point flat mats for last month. I have to gop back and recut a few letters, but overall it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looking quite good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It will be necessary to hand rub all the casting becasue of the leave created by directly engraving flat the mats. If more than a few people are interwsted in buying type, I am going to ship the type in individualbaggies, and send each buyer a free file along with the type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hope all is well with you in your new island paradise. Drop me an E. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim <!-- raw HTML omitted -->******* <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes Jim, we both seem to agree that ink is far to cheap. I think the pigment should be made from burnt flesh from &quot;errant pressman&quot;.
