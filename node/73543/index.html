  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all

I know this has been recently discussed but I'm still really stuck and I can't find an answer in any posts - any help would be really appreciated

Hanna New is an opentype fonts with 8 weights - Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Light Italic, Italic, Medium Italic and Bold Italic.

I wanted the fonts too appear under one Font name in Opentype savvy apps.

In apps like Word (PC) I know this is'nt possible and I wanted them to appear as Hanna New Lt and Hanna New Rg and with the use of B (Bold) and I (Italic) to get the rest of the weights.

To name the fonts I used the method described by Adam Twardoch here.

http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/font-family-naming-in-fontlab-studio-5-t313.0.html


Problem
------------------

The fonts work fine in OT savvy apps on the Mac, they appear in the correct order and work as expected.

The problem is Word on the PC - I'm testing in Microsoft Office Word 2007, Windows Vista. In Word the fonts appear as Hanna New Lt and Hanna New Rg in the menu, the problem I have is that Light and Medium are the same, I can't get Medium to work.

This problem DOES NOT happen when using Wordpad on Windows Vista. Do you know if this a bug in Word or I'm I doing something wrong with the naming.

I have attached images here showing the Naming table and Font Info Windows

		<div class="commentbody">In <a href="http://typophile.com/node/73501">this thread</a> you wrote, that the weight class of your light light style is 300 and the class of the medium style is 500, but you cannot style link these classes. Medium must be between 600 and 950, if it linked to 300.

By the way, I dislike it, if Light and Medium are style linked. If a typographic family contains more than two weights, I only would style link the uprights to the italics, but not the weights.</div>

I had changed the Medium weight class to 600 which has fixed the problem. Although it does work I was concerned this was wrong as Fontlab auto sets the weight class to 500 for Medium and this page http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#wtc states that the Medium should be 500.

You say you dislike the Light and Medium being style linked, is that a personal preference or is it something that will cause me technical problems - the way I did it was following the instructions from Adam.

Could you explain what you mean by "I only would style link the uprights to the italics, but not the weights."</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If the typographic family contains four styles only, from which one is displayed in the font menu of word, there are no doubts, that the displayed style is style linked to bold. But if the typographic family contains more weights, the user has to think about, which weight is style linked to which weight. You have not to expect technical problems, but it is uncomfortable in my opinion. In many fonts medium is style linked to regular, but not to light, because the contrast between regular and bold would be too big in body text. I prefer, to clearly know, which weight I select. I want to be able to pick up the weights from the drop down menu, but not with the help of the bold-switcher. There is no duty, that your styling group contains exactly four styles (regular, bold, italic and bold italic). Four styles are the maximum only. You can build styling groups, that only consist of the upright and the italic style of the same weight.</div>
