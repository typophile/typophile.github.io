    do you feel about Studio Dilena's efforts Oldnick?\r\n\r\nI think the A's crossbar
    looks a little high compared to the image I posted. It's hard to tell without
    an original type spec in front of me tho.\r\n\r\nIt's also hard to tell if the
    E's underbite is too pronounced or not, it looks like it might be but I wouldn't
    like to say it is just from the small image I posted.\r\n\r\nThe lower case u
    looks a little suspect as well. And overall, the whole lower case looks to have
    more constricted counters perhaps than in the image.\r\n\r\nIt's so hard to say,
    I know there is a type spec book kicking around with a full page of Semplicit\xE0,
    maybe that's what Studio Dilena used and they are actually much closer to the
    mark than I think.\r\n\r\nAny type designers have a valuable opinion they'd care
    to share?"

      <strong>.00</strong>, I'm the author of the font (<em>Semplicit\xE0</em> by

      don't you tell me what's wrong with the lowercases?\r\n\r\nTo <strong>mrjono</strong>:
      yes, the font is free. The A crossbar, as well as the font thikness and ascenders
      and descenders vary greatly with the size of the original (as a font lover,
      you must know it!). You can find some example here: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/n1ke/1483278380/\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/n1ke/1483278380/</a>,
      were you can compare some letters of different sizes.\r\nMy font is taken from

    a business card, and I must to say is that it worked just fine.\r\n\r\nThe Canada
    Type is a very good font, but:\r\n- The capital B is too different from the original
    (too wide and too optical corrected).\r\n- The capital G has the orizontal bar
    too high.\r\n- The capital J is invented.\r\n- The capital L is too wide.\r\n-
    The capital P is different (the bowl has a totally different shape).\r\n- The
    capital R is absolutely wrong (too wide and the leg is too angled).\r\nStrange
    enough, they made a very good work with the lowercases (strange cut at the base
    of the lowercase J, and strange lowercases H, M and N, but I think they get the
    spirit of the other letters), but numbers are totally invented.\r\n\r\nPS: I've
    published the font in the October of 2010, the Canada Type is of the August 25,
    2011 (according to what is written on MyFonts)."

    is due to my stubbornness in keeping constant the size of the strokes (yes I like
    the grotesk fonts).\r\n\r\nThe \"a\" was very close to the original, at last the
    original from the source that I have (Manuela Rattin, Matteo Ricci, \"Questione
    di carattere. La tipografia in Italia dal 1861 agli anni settanta\"), but I can
    try to improve it. Sincerely I hoped that to judge a font it was necessary, at
    least, its superficial knowledge.\r\n\r\nSince I am really overworked I probably
    would not be able to finish the font for a couple of months... If someone of you

    weights). Plus, all these do not take into account the point sizes: Semplicit\xE0
    was not super-accurately crafted as Simoncini faces would have been, but the small
    sizes in lead were adequately designed, and spaced.\r\n\r\n@oldnick: I assure
    you Semplicit\xE0 is not merely an average \"workhorse\": as you\u2019d see with
    printed material at hand it has a quite unique personality, and in Italy it has
    been a very important typeface.\r\n\r\nI have been working on a proper digital
    version of it, as I mentioned to Patrick Griffin last year, but it takes ages.
    It is a very important typeface for me, and I can\u2019t stand those versions,

    the first: I dreamed of a digital version since I started my interest, in the
