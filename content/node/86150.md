  but could not seem to find any relevant threads...\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is
  necessarily a hinting question or not, but I did not know how else to describe it...\r\n\r\nI
  have created a typeface in fontlab and exported it as a ttf without any hinting
  as I just wanted to use the font at large sizes in print. However, when I have been
  using the font in Illustrator and InDesign there is a very fine line from the font
  being legible on screen to it previewing strangely (see pic).\r\nAt first i thought
  it was just because I hadn't hinted the font, but then I noticed that in fontbook
  I can view it at quite a small size.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there might be some
  simple way to fix this when exporting in fontlab, \r\nI tried autohinting but this
  did not seem to make a difference. I have created other fonts without hinting them
  that have worked fine, so was just a little curious as to why it was happening this
  time.\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry if this question has been asked a thousand times, if it
  has and someone could direct me to another thread I would greatly appreciate your
  help. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenpreview_6157.gif]"

  body: "Adam, there are several kinds of font caches. Maybe you have only cleared
    the system and user related ones. To clear the Adobe fontcaches use the app I
    recommended (Onyx) or follow the instructions in this doc under item 10:\r\n\r\nhttp://kb2.adobe.com/cps/327/327791.html"
