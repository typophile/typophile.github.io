<div class=commentbody>Real links instead of JavaScript pseudolinks, meaning every photo has a permalink. Tags, sets, collections. You can upload by E-mail or any number of other methods.
Certain tasks are unreasonably difficult on Flickr, but most tasks aren’t.

<div class=commentbody>I don't necessarily buy the "more organized interface" theory... I think that can be pretty subjective. Picasa seemed more straight forward and easier to figure out than Flickr, though I haven't really spent enough time with Flickr to honestly compare.
the pseudo JavaScript link thing, and uploading via email for Flickr I wasn't aware of.
OK, I'm sold.

<div class=commentbody>The API is also pretty awesome. If you have a Wordpress blog, for instance, you can use a plugin to automatically use Flickr as a database of your images if you want to create a photo gallery. That's what I have on my page [[http://dangayle.com/photos|Photos]].
At my school's newspaper, we use Flickr to manage all photo content that is going to be published. Editors can comment on which ones they like best, etc., for selection for print. THEN, as an added benefit, our Webmaster can then hotlink to Flickr so that readers can look at higher-res versions and also to comment.
It's a win-win-win situation.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>Dennis, you allow others to use your photos, why not use the Creative Commons license on your pics?</cite>
Because my terms of use are more liberal than they allow for. I couldn't find a level that matched up with my terms which are basically:
These are free photos that may be used by anyone for any artistic endeavor,
personal or commercial without having to give credit or a link etc. Use these
images at your own risk.
I have some more CYA wording on a gobbledegook page, but that's about it.
The page originally came about because I had a hard time being organized, and couldn't remember where I had got things. I have a system now, but at the time, I thought it would be nice if there was a site with less restrictions.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Picasa is to Flickr as Windows 3.1 is to Macintosh OS 6. It's Google's attempt to catch up to Yahoo's Flickr (which Yahoo bought because they were smart). In a few years Picasa might be something, but it has neither the tools nor the critical mass to make it great.
By the way, Dan, I thought if I saw your Flickr stream that I might have a chance at figuring out what your avatar/icon image is. No luck. Is it a mold sample in close up? A smashed puppet? Help. =)

<div class=commentbody><em>Cool? stumb’lin around in the unedited photo offerings of a billion people, surrounded by ugly ads, poor page layout and a numbingly cold amount of white space will never, ever, IMHO, be cool.</em>
These are the features that put me off Flickr as well. It may be convenient in the way it functions, if the glowing reports are anything to go by, but a thing can be practical and lack coolness at the same time. You don't have to be as smart as David to figure that out. David is smart nonetheless, and sometimes it takes a person as candid as he to buck the mainstream.
I think David has a good point and all you need to do to see it is separate function from form. Anyway, why does David, or anybody else for that matter, have to "love" Flickr? Who is really cynical here---David or his detractors, those pouring on the unstinting praise?
Millions of people can be wrong or misguided.
The sheer amount of material at places like Flickr and Facebook make them a tedious waste of time for me. I need friends and contacts as much as anyone else, but finding them and "socializing" on the internet is kinda icky and creepy compared to networking in the real world with people I can see and poke for real.
That's all the sour grapes I got for now. Film at eleven ;^)

<div class=commentbody>For me it wasn't flickr itself but the company I wanted to keep ie fellow Typophiles and Typecon go-ers. But after a while I did start to like Flickr a lot. For one thing the UI while sometimes kooky; does let you do what you want with very little fuss and almost more importantly -undo it. So I suppose I think it's a very forgiving UI. And if it was cooler it might not be so fast. Really it's the photos I am there to see - not the cool site design.
Vince, I think the record will show that I am not really a comic sans basher but that Jerk Seasoning looks so utterly faux! Maybe not the bets choice this time I think.
On the other hand this was utterly appropriate:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/93279914@N00/138412125/in/set-72157594248353724/
And this approaches elegance really despite (not because of ) it's comic sans-y-ness
http://www.flickr.com/photos/93279914@N00/26776837/in/set-72157594248353724/
But back on topic - this shows why Flickr is fun.</div>

<div class=commentbody>For me it's not about stumbling around... it's about viewing pics of old high school friends you wouldn't otherwise keep in touch with. It's about meeting some random Veer employee at TypeCon and discovering he also rides a Ducati cuz you found his Flickr stream. It's about staying in touch with someone who moved to Austin. And then maybe connecting for a meal at SxSW.</div>

"Stupor". I appreciate what you're saying Haley. We're all individuals, and I thrive on some of the things you prefer Flickr to. Travel magazines bore me. Boosk on art and science fascinate me. That kind of material fires my imagination and I draw creative inspiration from it. Looking at tons of images clogs up my mind.
I don't have much use for Flickr, and there isn't room or time in my life for it. With so much media making up our lives, mine is already full to capacity. Social appointments to keep, friends to visit and entertain---most people have them, and for me they come first. The internet comes last.
Flickr's function as a social resource is fine---except it has much more relevance for people dwelling on the North American continent than for an Australian. We have no Typecon down here. It seems most major players in the type industry are located in North America or Europe. I could use Flickr to stay in touch with people working in those places. Except I can't pull airline tickets out of my rear end. The upshot isn't practical for me.
As a way of staying in touch with people Flickr is all very well. I already do that by email tho, and it's much more intimate that way. I crave intimacy whenever I can get it. The open air exposed public nature of the internet puts me off.
Flickr is wonderful and I don't have a problem with it. Flickr duplicates aspects of living already covered by other resources and institutions which already serve me.
Boring.

I didn't mean it that way, sorry.

...nor is it about posting, by your examples. ;)
"It sounds like you haven’t really given Flickr a chance."
Or perhaps, the other way around? :)

Dennis - I found your site again today after loosing the url. I appreciate the images that you've graciously shared. Spent a few hours today working with XenoDream and figuring out the best way of adding photographic/textured backgrounds to images (with varying degrees of success ...)</div>

My pleasure. Good to see you here. There are lots of pro type designers here, so it is a more educational atmosphere than the old hangout.
