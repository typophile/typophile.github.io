body: "I need to identify the typeface used by the Chilean State Railways during the
  1940s and 1950s (and possibly much earlier) for the sides of their railway coaches.\r\n\r\nThe
  all upper-case style can be seen in the second photo down on the following page,
  ie the B&W oblique pic of the single carriage.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.railwaysofthefarsouth.co.uk/06drollingstock.html\r\n\r\nThe
  lettering above the windows reads 'F.F.C.C. del E'., ie the usual abbreviation for
  the 'Ferrocarriles del Estado', whilst below the waistline is 'Tercera Clase', or
  Third Class.\r\n\r\nThe typeface appears to be fairly formal but with wavy horizontals
  leading into the serifs.  There may be a drop shadow but this is not clear from
  the picture.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMartin C"
