body: "im looking for bold slab-serifs but with a \"human\" touch. caecilia is a bit
  too \"human\", while rockwell and lubalin graph are just too geometric. its just
  for educational purpose, research. the ones i already looked into are caecilia,
  rockwell, lubalin graph and clarendon.\r\n\r\nis this quote is correct?\r\n\r\n<cite>The
  impact of the Industrial Revolution brought profound changes to printing and typography

  target=\"_blank\">source</a>)\r\n\r\nim asking this because im doing a work on william
  morris, english socialist and one of the first people in the \"arts and crafts movement\",
  living from 1834 - 1896. he also created 3 typefaces.\r\n\r\nwere slab-serifs a
  normal thing while he lived? after my research i'd have to say yes, but i want to
  know it for sure..\r\n\r\nthanks for any help!"

    Rosewood fill, which is massively overused.\r\n\r\nThere's also TheSerif from
    Thesis but that's very similar to Caecilia."

  body: "hmm, thanks for your help. i have some ideas for an experiment, and i know
    how i want the face to feel, but im not totally convinced by my aesthetic idea..
    thats why i asked here, to find a direction to take.\r\n\r\nall five fonts named
    here helped me, so any other will do it, too.\r\n\r\n(im still also interested
    in the historical question i asked)"

  body: "<em>is this quote is correct?</em>\r\n\r\nYes. But slab serif faces were
    used for display settings, or as a contrast face in text, rather than the main
    style. Like we use a bold sans to contrast a regular serif face today.\r\n\r\nThe
    only form of contrast that Morris tolerated was between caps and U&lc -- had he
    addrressed typography earlier in his career, or lived longer, he might have developed
    a larger palette of typefaces and started to use them together."

  body: "</i>Slab serifs as text typefaces are an end-of-the-19th-century innovation.
    Although Morris wouldn't have thought much of the slab serifs you name, it's arguable
    that his Kelmscott Chaucer typeface is a slab serif. ITC Italia is a modern slab-serif
    which is a reasonably direct descendant from Morris' work, btw (being based on
    a rip-off of Morris overseen by a distant relative of mine).\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    of oldstyle numerals and ligatures, and sets nicely at body text sizes.

  body: "thanks again for all your help. thomas phinney, it seems you know a lot about
    his faces! i couldnt find a really high-res-version of any of his books, do you
    know a link by chance? i was never able to really have a good look at the body
    text face.\r\n\r\ni did this research because im doing a collaboration with a
    friend of mine. we gave a quote to each other and have to interpret it with a
    own font - just the glyphs you need to write the quote. i got one by william morris
    (\"give me love and work; these two only.\"). i ended up with a geometrical slab
    serif with very thing, coltish serifs - but im totally unsure if i get two pass
    the gap between \"industrial\" and \"geometrical\" (i want to do a modern interpretation,
    and modern in an industrial sense for me means geometrical).\r\n\r\nbut all the
    inspiration you gave me here helped me, it wasnt for nothing. thanks again! (and
    if anyone wants to add anything, do so! please!)"

  body: Sorry to resurect this thread, but I was looking for something like Caecilia,
    but with a little a little more character and variation, and found Dalton Maag's
    Lexia... very nice slab, with a number of slab free lc characters. I originally
    found it being used in the Marks & Spencers "Your M&S" magazine as sub heads.
