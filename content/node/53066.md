  body: maybe somebody could just direct me to a heavier serifed Trajan style font.
    that 'Q' is key to the logo, and is clearly from Trajan, but the "M" has serifs
    on top and the 'P' has a closed bowl, and the serifs look substantially heavier
    than Trajan's.

  body: "thanks Stephen, but antiquated serif's aren't quite what i'm looking for.
    i'm particularly searching for a Roman column style font, small-caps and all,
    with heavier serifs than Trajan. the antiquating (that's a word, right?) i can
    do myself, but typeface design isn't really a hobbyist sport.\r\n\r\nso help's
    appreciated"

  body: Goudy's Trajan has heavier serifs, but the P and M are still in the original
    column style (i.e., open bowl on P and no serifs on M).
