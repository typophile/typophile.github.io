  or not I've kerned my font correctly. I wanted the nice airy space in between letters,
  but does it look okay? \r\nThanks so much, it's my first attempt and I want it super
  perfecto!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nFarzin[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerningtest_6397.jpg]"

  body: Thanks Bert, so you reckon bring the TE closer, and even bring the letters
    overall closer? does the spacey look not work? lol sorry for the questions, it's
    for my own little brand so it's my baby:)

  body: I think he means to tighten a bit the space between the two words (i.e. between
    Y and A), not inside them.

  body: There's too much space between L and I, and maybe too little between I and
    E.
