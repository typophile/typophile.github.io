body: "I would much appreciate critique for this rough starting-point of a logo for
  a fictional organisation. This is for a school project.\r\n\r\nBasically, I am building
  a professional brand for an exclusive, members-only recreational rifle club that
  caters to professional shooters and affluent males such as businessmen, politicians
  etc. and their fathers/sons etc. The concept is to create a higher-end shooting
  facility and associated products to cater for professional shooters and hobbyists
  who have the resources to afford a greater quality experience.\r\n\r\nRegarding
  critique, I would like feedback on type combos/choices, general arrangement of elements
  and effectiveness at representing the brand I have described above.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo_5025.jpg]"

  body: "\"Established of MMXII\"\r\n\r\nOverall I'd say that it is busier than it
    needs to be, and it also looks too cluttered (as in lacking white space). Also
    a perched crow with spread wings implies instability, which is something that
    doesn't really align with \"noble\" and \"affluent.\""

  body: "I realize how that reads now. The bird wasn't intended to be a crow, but
    it's interesting to hear that it looks like one. I'll lose the bird. I will remove
    'Gunnery Range' also. The name says enough.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n"

  body: "Logos need to work in a small size. Reduce your logo to postage-stamp size
    and you'll find that some elements become way too small to read.\r\n\r\nI'd eliminate
    \"gunnery range\", that \"x\" and \"established MMXII\" (or else find a much more
    interesting and legible way to present it).\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have a perched bird.
    It's not sporting to shoot a bird that isn't in flight.\r\n\r\nFor inspiration
    you might want to research logos of other exclusive venues, such as high-end golf
    resorts, luxury restaurants and hotels, men's clubs (not strip joints but traditional
    mens' clubs for rich guys), etc. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo_6278.png]\r\n\r\nHere's the revised
    version. I have eliminated much of the unnecessary elements. I'm debating over
    the inclusion of a bird at all, but I have changed it.\r\n\r\nIs the type tight
    enough vertically? \r\nWhat about kerning?"

  body: The all caps is tracked way too tight.  The all center aligned composition
    seems unconsidered.  'of' isn't centered between the horizontal rules. The rules
    extending beyond the text seems arbitrary and unnecessary.  Hope that helps!

  body: Yea.  All the text is centered.  Often when people have trouble arranging
    things they just center them with everything and think that it looks balanced.  It
    is not a very strong composition in general.

  body: I see. Can you suggest alternatives then? I have now visually aligned 'The'
    and 'of'.

  body: "I think you've got the basis of a promising logo, but as apankrat mentioned,
    it's still looking a little cluttered.\r\n\r\nYou've got a lot of elements in
    the logo, and they're all doing different things. The owl (I think it's an owl)
    is facing left, the italics slope to the right, and the other elements stand upright.
    Also there's a lot of difference in the relative sizes of the logo elements. The
    words 'Riflery, Guild, Noblemen' are much larger than the smallest elements.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you could try making all the elements closer to each other in size. Also try using
    the shape of a bird from front on and no italics, which might help with the centering
    of the logo. And I would have the date read 'EST. MMXII' so people know why the
    logo includes the year.\r\n\r\nHope that helps"
