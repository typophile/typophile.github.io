  body: "And it can be downloaded from copyfonts dot com.\r\nI don't know what the
    story is with a large sub-group of Dan Solo's digitizations that are no longer
    available from the usual merchants. In particular, just about NONE of the fonts
    included on the assorted 24-font CD / Book combinations from Dover publication
    can be found, while many of his fonts are at myfonts."

  body: "(Loving the new sp@m filters...)\r\n\r\nI don't think any of the fonts from
    Dan Solo's CD/Book publications were ever [legitimately] published elsewhere,
    they were created just for Dover in the 1990s. Those digitizations, while not
    the worst, leave a lot to be desired. His later fonts were published through MyFonts
    in 2004/2005, and seem to be of much higher quality."

  body: FWIW, Greta is apparently based on a 1975 Mecanorma font called Garbo (get
    it?) [[http://pinterest.com/pin/53269208062972029/|by Gary Cooke]].

    of Solo's fonts on MyFonts is probably the ideal recipient of donations for use
    of his other fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is shown as "Garbo".
