		<div class="commentbody">Well it certainly couldn&#39;t hurt. I am impressed by the talent in Scandinavia. <BR> <BR>I wonder if Jim Rimmer would join us? Mind you, he will think I am going nuts. I am forever talking about going somewhere else. It is the nature of this beast. That&#39;s why I like boats, it seems more normal to move around in a boat.  But land? First of last week I was off to St. Petersburg, then changed my mind and decided to buy an apartment in Poland. Turned out it was in the middle of one of the world&#39;s largest coal mines. They named two terminal diseases after the place. So I decided Bosnia was the place for me. Split, nice coastal town. I was wondering if they had Dalmatian dogs there. <BR> <BR>I can not blame it on the weather. That&#39;s what boats are good for. Excuses.  <BR> <BR>So this would be something to stick around for. Maybe I could gather up some interesting material. I am not sure how easy that would be. I have something you would all love to see. Or hate to see! Either or,</div>
