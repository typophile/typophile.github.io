body: "The vector file has long been lost for this logo, and I'm trying to recreate
  it without gradients.  Any thoughts?  The r & t are fairly distinctive...though
  the r looks like it may have been modified.  Definitely looking for something with
  similar e & t characters.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJason"

    uppercase C is a bit different.  Anyway, it was Fenice that I needed most.\r\n\r\nAppreciate
    the help!\r\n\r\nJason"
