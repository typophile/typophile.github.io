  body: "You might want to repeat this (or ask a moderator to move it) to the build
    forum, you will need to explain what software you are working from and to, if
    it is Illustrator to Fontographer you need to draw a bounding box of the same
    size for each glyph in the Illustrator file(s) so that when you import it to Fontographer
    the bounding box scales itself equally for each glyph, then delete the bounding
    box so you are left with the glyph, if this is not what you are looking for I
    think I misunderstood your question.\r\nTim"
