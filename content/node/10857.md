  body: 'Overall, I like it, especially the visual trademark, which looks dynamic
    and conveys the idea of communication... also the green &#40;at least as it looks
    via the web&#41; has a nice tint.  <BR>In terms of the typography, the contrast
    between impact and speak makes sense, of course, but it looks as if you not only
    changed the weight of the font but also the size, which is just a tad bit confusing.
    The change is not big enough to really make a satisfying contrast but noteable
    enough to make you wonder if there was some mistake. I&#39;d go for the same &#40;optical&#41;
    size.  <BR>The claim Hearing is believing looks as if it has no constructional
    context with the rest '

  body: 'I like it.  <BR> <BR>Nitpicks: <BR> <BR>the &#39;i&#39; just doesn&#39;t
    seem to fit. <BR> <BR>the change in size bothers me a bit too. maybe increase
    the light face a bit? <BR> <BR>I think the tagline face needs a bit more exploration.
    As it is now, it doesn&#39;t seem to be either similar enough or contrasting enough
    from the logotype face.'

  body: Yep, the i was my first thought. The trouble is in the dot. Try it round or
    try it with no dot. Yes! No dot, like on the cd sample you provided. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: Hey People, <BR> <BR>First of all thanks for the support here... <BR>Nitpickin&#39;
    is nice :o&#41; <BR> <BR>Generally I agree on that dot-subject - it&#39;s too
    noteable. <BR> <BR>HD&#62; The customer wanted a constrast between &#34;Impact&#34;
    and &#34;speak&#34; &#40;speak is actually the subbrand&#41; and therefore I decided
    to do the weight-change to seperate the words... I can see now that the effect
    is too weak. <BR> <BR>The tagline needs also to fit the proportions! <BR>Along
    with the business-card. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>/Henriko

    visual/conceptual reason. Doing it to  <BR>emphasize two different words looks
    amateurish. <BR> <BR>At small sizes the smallest dots on your S may <BR>not hold
    up.'

    you using?

  body: Although I do like the three column look on the card. I&#39;d also have to
    ask if you intend to ship a magnifying glass with your card? ;^&#41; Teasing you,
    but you might need to rethink that point size. Unless of course your card is larger
    than standard size? I agree with everyone else about the dot above the &#39;i&#39;,
    as well as Joe&#39;s comment about the dots. Perhaps there is anothe way, visually
    impactful&#40;?&#41;, to break the elements apart and jazz up the card a bit more?
