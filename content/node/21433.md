  body: ThinkAGM, nice cutting! I'm curious if you penciled that out or just went
    at it with scissors/knife? I tried to free style and don't think the idea warranted
    the execution, where I could see yours as a very impromptu process.

    body: Aaron, I used the x-acto knife at work ! It was pretty tedius , but I did
      have a  sketch to refer to. It did not come out as clean as I wanted it to be,
      but it does the job I hope!

    didn''t sketch first, just didn''t take the time I guess. Lame. The whole warn/warm
    thing didn''t quite come across, cutting is so permanent and all, no erasing,
    or worse, no dragging of points. '
