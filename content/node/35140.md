  from but have not heard back. I'm trying to identify the display font he used, which
  seems to be a somewhat rounded, condensed sans serif. That lowercase 'a' is throwing
  me off, it's like a cross between Variable and Helvetica. Anyone have any idea what
  it is?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roundedsans_4003.gif]"
