  types to explore - for me it is Eric Gill's Sans in its mnay forms - plus his father-in-law
  Edward Johnston's charismatic and ground-breaking Sans for the London Underground
  (still very much in use and full of beans and new applications today) not to mention
  Joanna who, as well as being a fine fnt somewhat akin to his Perpetua, was also
  incidentally Johnston's daughter, hence the font name.\r\n\r\nTop that list of three
  font families off with Bembo or Goudy etc or whatever you like working with and
  you have enough type variations and weights etc to keep you busy for a year or three
  ringing the changes and possibilities.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is my first post
  - just stumbled on this lovely site while idly Googling for a beautiful alphabet
  series of lithos by The Beggarstaff Brothers (which I did not find, any help anyone
  can give will be very gratefully received). I have owned an original for the letter
  \"Y is for Yokel\" for fifteen years and want to find out the rest.\r\n\r\nBut back
  to my question: Do you find that, except for specific briefs of course, you come
  back to certain type families - rather like a musician having a favourite instrument
  which you get better at playing the more varied ways you use it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill_3493.jpg]"

    I think it is important to do so. But sometimes the project doesn't need a rocket

  body: "That was nice Chris, good text for a type specimen...?\r\n\r\nI worked as
    an advertising agency art director in the 1980s. An agency would have many clients,
    and each had its own typeface. The most fun work I did was for the Ad Club of
    Toronto, which organized monthly lunchtime speaking events. One year my boss was
    the chair, and every month I'd be called upon to design a flyer to be mailed to
    members, advertising the upcoming event. This was an imposition, as I wasn't remunerated,
    so I rewarded myself by indulging in using a different set of typefaces each time
    (ah yes, the old pro bono accommodation). One month Folio Extended heads with
    Fairfield text, next month ITC Fat Face Black with ITC Caslon No.224 Medium, and
    so on. I did settle down a bit in the 90s, and recall Myriad Bold Condensed in
    a lot of sidebars in financial newsletters. I went to town with Adobe Garamond
    when it was released, as it introduced the opportunity to apply \"real\" typography
    to desktop publishing--small caps, old style figures, swash characters, extra
    ligatures, titling, &c. For one newsletter I managed to use almost every font
    in the set, except the one of bold superiors.\r\n\r\nNow that I design type full
    time, I continue to follow the \"so many flavours, try them all\" approach, although
    critics such as Bald Condensed have discerned favorite themes. \r\n "

    here, but when i begin considering fonts for a given assignment i start by setting
    the words, headline, or sample in a variety of extreme variations, just to see
    how they feel.\r\n\r\neven if i'm sure a title or word demands a script, for example,
    i'll set it in several scripts, a chunky sans, lowercase serifs, circus type,
    whatever. i want to see it take on unexpected qualities, even if i drag it back
    to an understated and perhaps more predictable solution.\r\n\r\nusually my initial
    instincts are confirmed but there are surprises. i'm essentially self-taught,
    so i may be wasting time in my round-about methods, but i feel confident about
    the results and i enjoy the process.\r\n\r\ni'm usually designing for film or
    video titles where the criteria are rather different than for print, but i always
    print out many test groups and examine the words on paper in a variety of fonts,
    as that retinal experience yields a unique kind of information about the choices."

  body: "As a letterpress lover who works with lead type, I prescribe to the limitation
    philosophy, in part because I have (or had) no choice. But, because I really enjoy
    setting type by hand, and because I don't like to find reasons to bitch, I decided
    to embrace that limitation, and in doing so have become an advocate of having
    a \"house typeface,\" or a library of \"house fonts.\" (In my case it's the Century
    family and News Gothic by MF Benton...I feel lucky to have this stuff in metal
    because I believe it's classic American type.)\r\n\r\nNow that I've entered the
    digital age and have an unlimited number of options (well, limited I suppose by
    the pocketbook, but digital fonts are a lot cheaper and lighter and smaller than
    lead type), I've made a conscious choice to stick to my house fonts when possible,
    which are dictated by my metal type collection.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER...I operate as
    a private press, primarily, and I like the signature that my chosen house fonts
    give to my work. When it comes to freelance work for clients, I look first to
    my house fonts, but allow myself to explore other options whenever necessary.\r\n\r\nThis
    means that limiting oneself to a specific set of house fonts is, in a way, branding
    your designs, which may or may not be something a person wants to do. I think
    there are clients who might appreciate it; potential clients may choose you as
    a designer because they like your \"brand.\" On the other hand, there are clients
    who will have no interest in working within your own personal-taste-driven typeface
    choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There are type families that are very versatile, and of course they will
    get used a lot. Trade Gothic is still kicking because it's so unassuming and utilitarian.
    But that's not the same thing as being afraid to try new things, or lazy about
    making decisions. There are new, versatile workhorse families introduced every
    year. So there isn't really any reason for design to be as stale as it sometimes
    is (in the US anyway). When someone's portfolio clearly reveals what one font
    CD they own, or when a designer makes very different campaigns or products all
    look the same, something is wrong. It's like eating the exact same bland lunch
    every day. \r\n\r\nIt's one thing to explore and truly understand the range of
    a typeface. That helps you know when not to use it as well as what it can do.
    Every typeface has a different range of applications. It's another thing to get
    in a rut with a few comfortable, safe, and reliable families, ignoring everything
    else. \r\n\r\nI think the method described by Ch is ideal. By trying various unexpected
    things before committing to a certain typeface, you can learn new things about
    a few different ones, and experiment with voice. "

  body: 'My standard approach is two type families for one client nonprofit agency:
    the main, a serif workhorse with plenty of weights and both lining and oldstyle
    figures, easily switchable (but never on the same job). Then, for highlights and
    sidebars, a well-matched sans. But after a few years, as PattyFab says, you get
    tired of those faces, but the client is happy and doesn''t want to re-invent the
    wheel, so you''re stuck. I used Bitstream Arrus as soon as it was released and
    got tired of it within three years--no fault of Arrus. But there''s too much happening
    in type today to limit yourself to a handful of families, as Vignelli did years
    ago.'

    - I work on a lot of co-editions (books translated from a foreign language into

    Actually I think that in the U.S. especially cover design for books is much more
    understood as packaging that sells and there\u2019s a lot more effort put into
    that. I can\u2019t think of a Chip Kidd here. Being conservative about book design
    in Europe probably comes from traditionally judging a book by its content rather
    than the packaging. Old school. It\u2019s like if a book is good from the ouside
    it has to be bad inside."

    it's actually a very vital category of design. But I think that moves away from
    the original question. Can you get by with very few families? It's certainly possible,
    but that policy probably works better with versatile families that can handle
    display as well as text, a few different styles, and a certain number of typefaces
    that have a neutral quality. \r\n\r\nHoefler & Frere-Jones show examples on their
    website combining various families of theirs. It's wonderful and informative because
    they demonstrate some of the versatility of the various designs and they also
    show how rich and varied layouts can be when type is combined well. You could
    stick to one foundry's work, if it is well-rounded. "
