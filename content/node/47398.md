body: "I'm close to pulling the trigger on purchasing FontLab Studio for my project.
  I've already downloaded the trial version and played around with it a bit, with
  Cabarga's <em>Logo, Font & Lettering Bible</em> usually at hand.\r\n\r\nThe application
  is complicated, in the main because it's so sophisticated. But I am also simply
  getting used to drawing with Bezier curves, which is almost entirely new. I anticipate
  that the workshops I'll be attending at TypeCon in Buffalo in a few days will make
  things easier for me. I have a feeling that even when I'm able to achieve the curve
  I want, it is still taking me many minutes and steps that are probably unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI've
  heard, and plan to heed, the wise-sounding advice to work on font design with paper
  and pen first, before going to the digital tools. But it may be hard to resist playing
  with my new toy, too!"
