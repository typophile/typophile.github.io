body: "I've been working on kerning + metrics of a typeface but ran into the weirdest
  of issues.\r\nI generate an .otf font and when I go to InDesign to test it the last
  line of any paragraph displays like the image I attached. I don't have the least
  idea what did I do to make it go this bad so I'm checking in to see if anyone has
  run into this issue before!\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nRodrigo"
