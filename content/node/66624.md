body: "I really like the minimal look of this logo and the associated type.  Can anyone
  tell me what it is?\r\n\r\nI've looked around on MyFonts and it looks like it might
  be a modified Nobel extra light, but I'm still not sure.  Any thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/element_logo_6577.png]"

  body: This is most likely custom, but you can get pretty close by rotating the 'e's
    on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/neue_helvetica_std_33_thin_extended/?&sample_text=element&sample_size=74">Helvetica
    Extended</a>.

  body: "Helvetica is pretty much always the answer to every type question isn't it?\r\n\r\nI
    assumed the 'e's were custom, but I still don't think this is Helvetica.  If you
    look at the 't' you can see that the cross is shorter on the left whereas helvetica
    has it equal on both sides."

  body: There's also a similar 'e' in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_avant_garde_gothic_pro_extra_light/?&sample_text=See%20alternate%20%E2%80%98e%E2%80%99%20below.&acs_ss=10&update=0">ITC

  body: It's very possible that the 't' was customized. These kinds of modifications
    are common in logo design.
