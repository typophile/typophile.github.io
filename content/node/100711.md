body: This font has several unique letters/characters.  Lowercase "r" appears uppercase
  with the "foot" kicking up.  Lowercase "t" appears uppercase.  Lowercase "h" appears
  taller than other letters.  Lowercase "u" is high on the right side, whereas lowercase
  "v" is high on the left.  Lowercase "w" is taller in the middle than the sides.
  "!" looks like a lowercase "l" with a dot under it.  Hope the picture helps.  Thanks!
