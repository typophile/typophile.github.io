  magazine published in Mexico City. Since 2002.\r\ntiypo is the only magazine in
  Mexico specialized in typography, the interest of tiypo is to spread the typographic
  and iconografic work that is developed inside and outside Mexico. \r\nIn addition
  it wants to be the main forum of new generation of  Mexican typographers, that in
  the last ten years, have been creating new typographies that little by little have
  filtered in lands of the national and international design.\r\nTiypo also has developed
  parallel projects in which it has invited to participate diverse designers from
  Argentina, Germany, The Netherlands, USA, Venezuela, Spain and Mexico. In these
  projects, the typography was applied to posters (Tipograf\xEDa, Lenguaje visible),
  animations (tiypo-movil) and recently the creation of a dingbat called Mexinbat
  tiypo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tiypo.com\">www.tiypo.com</a>\r\n<!--break-->"
