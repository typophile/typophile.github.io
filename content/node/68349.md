  good tips/rules/articles/tutorials on typography and what makes it look good etc.
  Because I seem to be having problems in my web design with the text looking like
  it belongs/being easy on the eyes/looking fantastic. So I was just wondering if
  anyone would like to help out :D\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n    Nub"
