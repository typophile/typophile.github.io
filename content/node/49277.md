  FM, I just published a <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/FM_docs/Name_table_entries.pdf\">PDF</a>
  on this subject. Also some details are revealed on how the automatic generation
  of OpenType Layout features is handled. At the coming <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/FM_docs/FM_Track_2008.pdf\">FM
  Track</a> in St. Petersburg more info will be given, also on OT Master.\r\n"

    #Macintosh [...]\u2019\r\n\r\nYes, I noticed the wrong comment, but most readers
    will probably understand what should have been written there. Nevertheless I will
    change the page shortly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should add here to the info in the PDF
    that at DTL we normally edit the name IDs directly in the UFM files using a text
    editor. Not only \u2018basic\u2019 name IDs, like copyright notice, manufacturer
    name, URLs and license description can be simply copied into the UFM files, also
    the complete UFM files can be copied and internally renamed (in batch) for weight/style
    related fonts of the same family that support for instance other scripts (every
    font has its own UFM and kern file, which are connected by file name to the corresponding
    glyph database).\r\n\r\nFor the OpenType production normally a centralized \u2018standard\u2019
    OT layout features file is used (features that don't match the character set are
    removed during font generation), but when the features file is specifically customized
    it could make sense to put the font names in the file itself (if only to mark
    the file)."
