  body: "Ummmmmm...... I guess to BjornH this is not good enough, bown down to the
    mighty BjornH. \r\n\r\nI think he is the ultimate say when it come to all things
    design, last I checked.\r\n\r\nThe counter spaces in the \"p\" characters need
    to be smaller. The space between the counters and the bowls is too thin and causes
    a \"tangent\": unnecessary visual and optical space. \r\n\r\nAlso, why is there
    a counter space in the lower case \"i\". I would remove that."

  body: "What he means is that pre-teen cosmetics line is ethically very questionable.
    I agree with that. Chemistry and young children don't go together. I don't want
    my girlfriend to use too much cosmetics anyway. Not to even think about kids.
    I'm exaggerating but it's like selling drugs to kids. It messes with their own
    perception of themselves and their society.\r\n\r\nIf a cosmetic line for pre-teen
    population really has to exist there must be something SERIOUSLY wrong with their
    parents, education, culture and society. Not to even mention the government.\r\n\r\nI
    did check the logo but I'm going to use a veto on the comment."

    use some refinement. I find it quite nice how the circles get bigger with each.
    This creates a nice sense of depth. Keep this, and try to polish up the whole."

  body: "*rolls eyes* It's not as if pauljames asked anyone about whether they thought
    marketing cosmetics to pre-teens was ethical or not. He wants feedback on his
    logo design. \r\nI agree with bert_vanderveen I'd like to see color."

  body: "Seems fine. It will need to be set in pink glitter glue, of course. ;o)\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, color is a requirement for this one. You could also probably get a way with
    adding some flourishes. I assume this will be sold in those pre-teen mall stores
    that have more gaudy logos per square inch than anywhere on earth, so you might
    have to 'tart it up' a bit more to compete."
