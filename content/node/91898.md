    <em>in general</em> for \"file compression\". JPEG is the only graphics file format
    I know that (a) allows you to \"reduce quality\" (which is a telling sign it's
    not a <em>normal</em> compression, where you'd get the same image after decompressing),
    and (b) compresses more than your average format <em>just because</em> it may
    decide to average large patches of different color into one solid block. And when
    decompressing that, you are bound to get \"artifacts\".\r\n\r\nSo you seem to
    have a problem with a certain bitmap image. You \"compressed\" it using JPEG,
    and now you are disappointed that you do <em>not</em> get the \"exact same image\"
    back when you view it. Yeah -- that's how it works. If you don't like that, use
    a different file compression, and make sure to pick a lossless one.\r\n"

    are an organic extension from the original to be sure. File compression has a
    way of doing this as I mentioned before. So ya, Artifacts can evolve. Can they
    devolve,  yes of course they can. I'd have to do up some examples but off the
    top of head I'd say that a single Artifact can evolve or devolve in bit depth
    (bpp). Can it explore new niches, as in 'is it mobile'? It's not appropriate to
    equate human mobility with pixel information mobility, but ya I'd say that Artifacts
    can move within their digital realm. And that's a sad sad thing if an Artifact
    can realize a realm outside of it's realm - so to speak. Kinda like Romeo & Juliet

    normally - and without  much thought - of Graphite, Lead, and Ink (just to mention
    a few major players).\r\nBut, the realm of Silicon technology is at it's very
    core still a very natural realm. The digital realm is built from/of natural elements
    including all polymers. They all come from somewhere - and that somewhere is Nature
    itself!!!\r\n\r\nAnd so too does Graphite.\r\n\r\nI don't believe that the digital
    realm is as neat and tidy - sterile and controlled - as it is made out to be.
    \ Even the best mathematical equations can't totally control - an Artifact.  And
    for the processes that try to go on the Vector existence yearns for the textural
    / seemingly natural characteristics of the Raster community!! And at the very
    end of the day - it all degrades - it all falls apart and goes back to ... Nature.
    \ So communities such as Vector don't rule all that much ... and as I said before
    Vector society is conceited.\r\n\r\nI think Artifacts are pixels of information
    that have been created (progeny if you will), to be pushed / driven to find some
    sort of Natural freedom. And that freedom of expression goes right straight back
    to everyone and anyone who has been driven / pushed by an Idea. Anyone who has
    taken the chance to be free ... expressed via Graphite and Lead.\r\n\r\nAnd ya,
    Artifacts are the product of Individuality from within the digital realm.  They
    are Silicon's expression of freedom from within a man made confine! Which is,
    by-the-way, driven / pushed by the Idea.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe film's working

    you speak of may be due to the nature of the silicon world they live in, but that

    it exists in, the fact that silicon is used instead of some other material, etc.
    As long as someone else sets the parameters, whether it be the programmer, the
    algorithm creator, or God, artefactual rebellion can only take place within predetermined

    that's the beauty of Kanizsa's holy triangle ... to be completely devoid of emotion?

    to describe the precise point at which percepts\u2014the raw data\u2014from the
    five physical senses met the Sense of Self: that is, cognition is the nexus between
    awareness and understanding. What is revelatory about Amp\xE8re\u2019s definition
    is his choice of words, because it illustrates clearly that our understanding
    of phenomenal reality is profoundly influenced by an unseen, sixth sense: the
    Sense of Self.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other five senses, the Sense of Self is both
    intensely personal and transpersonal. We may imagine that we can see something
    \u201Cthrough another\u2019s eyes,\u201D but we cannot, because what we see through
    our own eyes is colored by this Sense of Self, which is a product of mind. Furthermore,
    mind is a product of culture: the context within which the \u201CI\u201D exists
    and interacts, socially and intellectually. Thus, this Sixth Sense acts as a lens

    or lesser degree. Thus, the statement \u201CReality is merely an illusion, albeit

    with Photoshop for my bitmap / raster goodness. Open up a new doc, let's say something
    standard from the Preset drop down menu such as the 800px x 600px with a white
    background.  Use whatever you tool you fancy to create a 250px wide x 350px rectangle
    and fill it with 255-0-0 red, and then Save-for-Web .jpg file with Quality of
    100% name it Red.\r\n\r\nClose out the 'live' doc, and open up Red.jpg. Re-save
    the Red doc as a .jpg with a Quality of 50% , name it Red_Artifacts.\r\n\r\nClose
    out the 'live' doc, and open Red_Artifacts. jpg. Grab your zoom tool, and zoom
    in 400% or so on one of the corners ... and there they are :) The more the process
    is repeated (especially with lower and lower Quality % settings), the more prevalent
    the Artifacts. I think it has something to do with a combo of factors including
    the color frequency of 255-0-0 red in the rgb gamut.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut\r\n\r\nHope
    those instructions will yield the similar results. Of course there are several
    methods in which Artifacts will appear, (simply scaling down a 255-0-0 red .jpg
    file is another simple method), but I don't see Artifacts as something unwanted
    ... they come with the territory :). If you prefer not to have any Artifacts present
    it is best to save pure red (and simple raster images in general) as gif files.
    \r\n\r\nAnd speaking of which that gif color table is f'n amazing. Someone should
    create tile patterns for the kitchen (or whatever) with 'em :) Simply load some
    image - or even better create one of your own - no matter how complex, and then
    view it's contents via the gif color table, take a screen shot of it, open the
    screeny and use the Eyedropper tool to identify the tile colours need to re-create
    the gif color panel - :)!!\r\n\r\nNerdy wall patterns! Use the free prog rasterbator

    full alphabet displays on my website routinely weigh in under 15kb, and they're

    Tim Griffin wrote a interesting article entitled Artifacts.  \r\n\r\nhttp://artforum.com/inprint/id=22606\r\n\r\nThe
    gist of which is beyond me but I did take interest in the last paragraph which
    I have copied to here:\r\n\r\n'Perhaps the problem itself\u2014the feeling of
    something being lost\u2014is, then, what needs sustaining now. In other words,
    unlike so many satisfying proclamations of an \u201Cend\u201D at previous moments
    of cultural turmoil\u2014even if only as a rhetorical device where, as Birnbaum
    says, the end of something like the novel is merely offered as another way forward\u2014an
    unstable relationship with the past might well be cultivated. Technology, as we
    have observed, often plays a role in the shaping of perception, and an apt metaphor
    for our current predicament may be found in the realm of digital imagery and compressed
    files. Whenever a given picture exceeds the capacity of a system\u2019s data rate,
    whenever an algorithm inaccurately renders an image\u2014that is, drops necessary
    information in its attempt to produce a seamless visual representation\u2014pixilation
    arises and the image disintegrates before one\u2019s eyes. And yet, strangely
    enough, these imperfections, newly created by an inadequate interpretive model,
    go by the term artifacts: So it is that we might create similar distortions through
    our thinking and mistakenly take them as evidence of some historical reality.
    Worse, perhaps, when we discover our misapprehensions, we quickly move to correct,
    even to expunge them\u2014precisely when we should be doing our utmost to sustain
    such images before the mind\u2019s eye, to submit the artifacts to scrutiny, for
    these mirages of the past will prove a vital part of the picture of our present.
    '\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSo yeah, phrases such as 'algorithm inaccurately renders'
    and 'image disintegrates' and 'imperfections' (etcetera),  and the human reaction
    to those I find to be interesting dramatic interpretations!\r\n\r\nn.  "

    here is the article...\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2009\r\n   Artifacts\r\nTim Griffin\r\n\r\nONE
    DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO LOOK VERY HARD to find a common thread running through the
    various texts in the current issue. Regardless of topic, it seems, nearly every
    contributor gravitates, sooner or later, to the same concern: that we are in the
    midst of an epochal shift the consequences of which are obviously powerful yet
    dauntingly unclear. \u201CSomething is falling apart right now, and not only in
    the art world,\u201D says this summer\u2019s Venice Biennale curator, Daniel Birnbaum,
    speaking to the ways in which our volatile social and economic context risks making
    any cultural endeavor seem out of tune, if not pass\xE9. \u201CI think we\u2019re
    at a moment in history where we\u2019ve already begun a kind of apocalypse of
    thought,\u201D director Jim Jarmusch adds, as if in direct reply. \u201CAll the
    models we have been led to believe in are crumbling.\u201D (And so, he says, the
    structure of his newest film revolves around ideas of the unconscious: After all,
    if the terms for subjectivity are changing rapidly, we\u2019d better make records
    of the latter before it becomes entirely unrecognizable to our own eyes.) These
    sentiments are only confirmed by critic Bruce Hainley in his survey of Larry Johnson\u2019s
    artwork over the past twenty years. The author returns time and again to the artist\u2019s
    lingering subtext of perishability, which extends from depictions of yesterday\u2019s
    technologies to intimations about the arcane tasks of pedagogy and critical writing
    and, further, to the fashioning of identity itself, which such technologies would
    shape. The underlying question, and the stakes: As the cultural conditions of
    the postwar era seem finally on the wane, who is the producer of art today\u2014and
    for whom is art made? \u201CThe \u2018I\u2019 is over, elided, deceased, absented,\u201D
    Hainley surmises. \u201CThere\u2019s no thinking \u2018eye\u2019 to see or read,
    no more subject to leave a trace, everything disappeared into nevermore, into
    n\xE9v\xE9.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nIn truth, our sense of history has been markedly
    unstable for some years. Immediately before the financial crisis\u2014which undoubtedly
    provided the spark for much of the consternation above\u2014there was, for instance,
    the \u201Cwar on terror,\u201D whose borderless expanse scrambled the coordinates
    of time for no other reason than that its paradigm was designed never to end.
    Now, however, it is our relationship to an unsettled past that seems as much a
    source of disquiet as our increasingly ambiguous future, recent decades suddenly
    not what they once appeared to be. In fact, our sense of the present seems to
    hinge on our reconstruction of the previous few years: How else can we reconcile
    its image of prosperity with our current grasp of what was residing, more abstractly
    and systemically, everywhere under the surface? And how else might art chart its
    course without somehow taking stock of the ways in which its basic form\u2014or
    even its very idea\u2014was enmeshed in a flawed understanding of those earlier
    cultural conditions? Many lectures and panels have lately been devoted to precisely
    these questions, reevaluating the recent past, revisiting the precursors of postmodernism
    and modernism\u2014even seeking out some approximation of an earlier hour\u2019s
    public sphere\u2014in order to regain some of art\u2019s bearings. (One gets a
    distinct sense on these occasions of people awkwardly trying to summon some memory\u2014not
    only of, say, how public discourse and theory are not separate from everyday life
    but also of how to engage an audience, or of how to be an audience, within such
    an engaged framework.) But here a note of caution sounded by artist Lorraine O\u2019Grady
    seems worth considering. Looking back in these pages at an exhibition she organized
    in the East Village during the early 1980s, she wonders what might have become
    of certain artists had events unfolded differently\u2014if critics or collectors
    had, for example, simply given a particular artist\u2019s work more attention.
    As compelling in her ruminations, however, is a suspicion of the historical impulse,
    of the very desire to establish set narratives for the past when there will always
    be worthy alternatives: \u201CThere are so many coexisting tendencies in any given
    time,\u201D she says. \u201CWhat is lost when the present reduces the past, ties
    it up with a ribbon so it can move on to the future? Is that result necessary?
    Is it real?\u201D\r\n\r\nPerhaps the problem itself\u2014the feeling of something
    being lost\u2014is, then, what needs sustaining now. In other words, unlike so
    many satisfying proclamations of an \u201Cend\u201D at previous moments of cultural
    turmoil\u2014even if only as a rhetorical device where, as Birnbaum says, the
    end of something like the novel is merely offered as another way forward\u2014an
    unstable relationship with the past might well be cultivated. Technology, as we
    have observed, often plays a role in the shaping of perception, and an apt metaphor
    for our current predicament may be found in the realm of digital imagery and compressed
