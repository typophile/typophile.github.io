body: "First of all, sorry for my bad English; I\u2019m not a native speaker.\r\n\r\nI
  look for historical information about origins of the term <em>em</em> (typographic
  unit of measurement).\r\n\r\nMany sources state that it descends from the letter
  <em>M</em>, since sometime and somewhere it had exactly square dimensions. This
  sounds credible, but I fail to find any reliable historical evidences.\r\n\r\nFor
  instance, when and where was the term <em>em</em> used for the first time? Who has
  invented it?\r\n\r\nAnd more important, was this word introduced as a precise metric
  description (\u201CI mean exactly the size of the letter M\u201D), or an associative
  one (\u201CI say <em>em</em> because it <em>associates</em> with a letter M which
  dimensions roughly resemble a square\u201D)? I incline towards the second choice,
  but I again lack any evidences.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who can point me to respective
  sources of information."

  body: "Em is certainly associative rather than strictly descriptive. The actual
    dimensions of a piece of metal carrying an uppercase M would vary depending on
    the typeface, but it tended to be roughly square; similarly, the N sort would
    seldom be exactly half the width of the M, but en became the name for half an
    em.\r\n\r\nI can't say when it originated, but I do note that neither em nor en
    are used in William Savage's <em>A dictionary of the art of printing</em>, 1841."

  body: "There is some confusion about ems in relation to \u2018squares\u2019 (in
    Dutch: vierkantjes). A square is a blank (space) with a width equal to its physical
    height. Eg for type size 11 cast on 12 the square would be 12 by 12. For type
    size 10 cast on 10: 10 by 10, etc.  We are talking about lead, of course (with
    antimony and other stuff in lesser quantities)\r\n\r\nA square divided by two
    would be a half (in Dutch: halfje). There were also blanks in the sizes of a third
    and a fourth plus a thinner measure called a \u2018thin one\u2019 (dunnetje, in
    most cases with a width of a point or so \u2014 these tended to be very rare and
    were often hoarded in secret stashes to be used in spacing caps headers). \r\n\r\nIn
    art school we would use the measures of half and lower for spaces, and square
    for inset. Don\u2019t know if this was an industrial practice, but the advantage
    was that one could pilfer other cases of type for these if there were not enough
    in the one you were using.\r\n\r\nWe never spoke of or used \u2018ems\u2019 and
    \u2018ens\u2019; that is, to my mind, something of the digital age and mostly
    associated with web design.\r\n\r\n(As insiders can tell, I used to be \u2014
    and still am \u2014 an advocate of unjustified setting.)\r\n\r\nNowadays, in digital
    typesetting, one would use the measure of the line feed for inset.\r\n\r\nPlease
    correct me if I am off \u2014 it has been 35 years."

  body: I spent my formative years setting type by hand from a California Job Case,
    and I can assure you there were Em-quads (square of the point size) En-quads (
    half the size of and Em) as well as 3 Em spaces (1/3 and em quad and suggested
    for word space) 4 Em spaces, 5 Em space and 6 Em Space. There were also  2- 3-
    and 4 Em Quads as well for bulking up lines. Besides these there were "Coppers"
    and "Brasses" which were thinner space material used to sung up your "Lock-up"
    in the "Chase" once you placed all your "Furniture" in the correct position and
    secured it using two "Quoins".

  body: "Although neither Wikipedia, nor its external web reference on the term, were
    helpful, a slightly later Google result has the Random House dictionary claiming
    the term originated in the period 1870-1875. (That could instead have been the
    date of the origin of the term \"mutton-quad\" as an equivalent - I found an 1871
    reference for that.)\r\n\r\nHowever, from Google Books, I find that one of the
    editors at \"Notes and Queries\" used Em Quad as his <em>nom de plume</em> in
    1857.\r\n\r\nAnd then I found an even earlier occurrence. An almanac for the year
    1686 referred to William Penn as \"Lord Penn\", the Kalendarium Pentsilvaniense,
    and the governing council commanded him to use \"a well-inked three-em quad\"
    to blot out the offending phrase - although it's possible the recent sources for
    this have changed the story."

    They helped me to find some more resources and new considerations:\r\n\r\n1. I
    found an [[http://www.lettermodel.org/wordpress/?p=280|article written by Frank
    E. Blokland]] that sheds some light on the origins of em, though not ultimately.\r\n\r\n2.
    I suspect that my research suffers from my bad English; maybe I fail to make the
    right queries for Google. I began with <em>origins of em</em> and <em>history
    of em space</em>; are these ones correct (both grammatically and semantically)?
    Should I formulate my queries in some other way?\r\n\r\n3. I also suspect that
    the real origins of em could be found not in English sources, but rather in other
    ones: espesially in old Italian and French, maybe German and even medieval Latin.
    But I don\u2019t know these languages, so I have no clue how to search for the
    right sources. Maybe you can give me some advise?"

  body: "Regarding your 3rd question I can try a brief response for the German speaking
    area: \u201Cem space\u201D has clearly only become widely used after the introduction
    of software based typesetting, although there might already been such terminology
    connected with typefounding machines and metal faces originating from English
    speaking countries. The term used for a \u201Csquare\u201D as detailed by others
    is \u201EGeviert\u201C (roughly translates to \u201Csquare\u201D, literally \u201C[four-by-]four-th\u201D),
    so there\u2019s no connection to the \u201Cem\u201D in terms of etymology. \r\nI
    don\u2019t have the literature here at the moment, but I\u2019d suggest looking
    at old typography primers (a search phrase for books.google would be something
    like \u201C[be set apart] by one em\u201D, but I didn\u2019t try yet!), and there
    are specialised multilingual dictionaries for printer\u2019s language, just visit
    any larger scientific library, or catalogue at first. "

    and 'en' are simply the pronounced names of the letters M and N in English, associatively
    adapted to describe the dimensions of type. As Frank Blokland's article indicates,
    earlier sources use 'm' and 'n' or (Moxon) 'm Quadrat' and 'n Quadrat'.\r\n\r\nThe
    first recorded English use of the term 'em' in the context of typesetting and
    printing, according to the OED (1st edition), is 1864, in a newspaper article
    about printers' union rate demands 'per thousand ems'. The OED definition notes
    that 'The em of pica is the standard', i.e. unless otherwise specified an em is
    presumed to be 12pt."

    rooms because it was so easy to confuse em and en. Remember that many composing
    rooms were close to running presses, so would be noisy. It was easy to mis-hear
    em for en and vice versa, and hence compositors took to using mutton and nut.
