  on an israeli first dergree in the israeli open university).\r\n\r\ni really want
  to study typography in an insitute (not in israel), but i can't find any programs.
  offcourse, i'm not talking about one or two seperate courses, i'm talking about
  respectable full-time typography studies.\r\ncould some of you please give me some
  names or links to such programs? \r\nthanks!"

  body: "I believe that [[http://www.arts.ac.uk/index.htm|University of the Arts London]]
    (formerly known as London College of Printing) has a good reputation, but the
    answer to your question depends on how you define and wish to practice \"typography.\"
    Display, book, information, type design\u2026\r\n\r\nAdditionally, now that you
    have finished your undergrad, do you wish to study this at a graduate level? That
    significantly narrows your search. If it's at a graduate level, I would recommend
    considering who your supervisor might be to assist you in your search, unless
    it's an entirely course based program in which case it's not as important."
