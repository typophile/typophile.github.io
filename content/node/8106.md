  Below I&#39;ve started a &#40;very brief&#41; list of Sans w/ OSF &amp; SC in multiple

  FontFont <BR>Quadraat Sans - FontFont <BR>TheSans - Lucas Fonts <BR>Officina Sans

    and Avenir there are enough weights that it&#39;s possible to use all caps, at
    a smaller size and incrementally heavier weight to simulate small caps and fractions

  body: <i>Erik Spiekermann mention a &#34;trend&#34; and not and innovation</i> <BR>
    <BR>Exactly. I would never claim having designed the first Sans with both O/S
    figures and Small Caps. Futura did have those figures back in 1927, and quite
    a few other faces did. Small Caps, however, were more unusual and still are. As
    a lot of Sans faces had larger x-heights than their Serif peers, one could more
    easily fake caps by setting them half a point or so smaller, something I often
    did in photosetting. Nowadays, I expect Sans faces to have all possible sorts
    of figures, tabulating, Old Style, lining &#40;kerned full size&#41; and perhaps
    even tabular figures with slight descenders and ascenders, as we did with FF Unit
    and actually ITC Officina which ITC didn&#39;t publish in the first release back
    in 1990. <BR> <BR>The reason FF Meta &#40;which was first designed in 1985&#41;
    got all the works was that I wanted to point out that it was really a Serif face,
    except those little strokes remained virtual. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/55712.gif"

  body: I&#39;m still using Mac OS 9 and there&#39;s no alt key on my keyboard. I
    use shift-W for the fi ligature for Adobe and Emigre fonts, whereas in the FF
    fonts it&#39;s shift-I. I don&#39;t mind using an expert set, since I can set
    up a style sheet for it in Quark. It just gets confusing when I&#39;m working
    on several projects simultaneously and they all have fractions. I end up using
    PopChar to grab the ligature out of frustration. <BR> <BR>The date on my Meta
    seems to be 1993. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in the process of upgrading to OSX so maybe
    this will sort itself out. In the meantime I just need to keep track of which
    set of keystrokes to use with each job. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the lovely fonts,
