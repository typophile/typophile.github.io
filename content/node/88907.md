body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jitcrunch_5396.jpg]\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  how to make text like the one above. I am looking to make classic curved text for
  t-shirts. I prefer cheap or free, but am willing to spend up to $100 for a program
  to do so.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help.\r\n\r\nAlso looking for ways to make the
  text distressed, like an old faded T-shirt.\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    an arc as in your image and then export as png file into Gimp to texture, or just
    do the effects all in Inkscape. Select the leter shape using the Edit Paths by
    Nodes tool > Object > Transform > Skew tab. Skew each letter individually, but
    first it best to draw a guide ;) \r\n\r\nInkscape is free (vector) - so too is
    Gimp (raster).\r\n\r\nI roll with Adobe products, but I do have Inkscape loaded
    on one machine and skewed some text but didn't distress any (looked at a few Filters
    though). Although I did notice that Inkscape has a D-map (displacement map) function.
    It's found via Filter > Filter Editor > Add Effects > select Displacement Map
    from the drop down. D-maps are awesome.\r\n\r\nAs for exporting your most awesome
    art work, my advice is to talk to your t-shirt guy. Some will work with .svg files
    and some not to happy about that. My experience is Adobe .ai files are well received.\r\n\r\nAnother
    option is to simply download a 30 day trail of Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop
    and skew the text as mentioned above (Skew). Photoshop will give a broader distress
    ability (including negative texturing) and you could also download machine wash
    filters for both. Great ones are to be found at Mister Retro and there's tons
    of tutes on the interwebz for those.\r\n\r\nGood luck! Hope that helps :) "
