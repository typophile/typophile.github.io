    a client recently ask me the same. He wanted an Italian style logo. He marked
    it as brown/yellow toned, modern and 'designerish'. That's not enough for me to
    make a good logo...\r\nSo if anyone has some thoughts on how to make a good Italian
    style logo, please hook up here.\r\n\r\n\xAE"

  body: "Looking at Mostra and Giacomo, they seem to be quite different. Mostra is
    very sharp and geometric, where Giacomo is soft and warm. \r\nI think the hard
    part is if you try to define a certain style that covers a few centuries. Perhaps
    we should narrow it down to the last 40 years? \r\n\r\nOk, let me make a kick-off
    (and I'm surely not an expert on Italian style fonts). Italian style fonts:\r\n-
    are quite often 'fat' like Extra Bold or Black\r\n- quite often have a slightly
    rotated backwards 'e', giving it a diagonal cross bar\r\n- are mainly serif fonts\r\n-
    can ofcourse be sans serif and then often have soft endings\r\n\r\nHow far am
    I off?  ;-)\r\nNow it's your turn.\r\n\r\n\xAE"

  body: "I'm a  Sicilian-American, not an Italian. I don't think Giacomo is particularly
    Italian. I do think that it is particularly me. The design of the Crema label
    does follow a particular vague Italian style, but it wasn't done by an Italian.
    Eurostyle, Microgramma, Egiziano were done by Novarese. Are they particularly
    Italian? Perhaps. The fonts shown on the Progetto-Italic site don't strike me
    as particularly Italian either.\r\n\r\n"

    Them being all different makes the question even more difficult. Finding more

    god, I still love Eurostyle. I'e used it throughout my complete academy time and
    it brings back a lot of good memories."

    Italy, graphically. She suggested me that outside Italy, for example for food
    packaging, we are identified by smooth, curvaceous scripts, etc., and not by the
    sharpness of futurism (we are living a futurism revival for the 100th anniversary
    of the futurism manifesto, and everything become irritating when is coupled with
    the quasi-fascist social decline of our country).\r\n\r\nThen I suggest to look
    at some late 19th century typeface and, if you have the opportunity, at the actual
    packaging of the period.\r\n\r\n@Mark\r\nI wish I could laugh"
