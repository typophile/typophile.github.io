  body: "<em>Eurostile by Aldo Novarese</em>\r\nNo way is this Novarese. Apart from
    the likelihood that some city department will have heard of an obscure Italian
    typeface from the sixties, if you look closely, you'll see that the counters would
    be square if it weren't for the radius a router makes. This is not based on a
    digital font. And if it were, it would be more like Bank Gothic, an old American
    staple. That does have oblique terminals, so it's not the exact model, but more
    likely could have been the one that the makers of the signmaking tools had in
    mind.\r\n\r\nAny idea when those signs were put up? And where?\r\n\r\n"

    You <em>are</em> right though, I\u2019m sure the signmaker had a sneaky eye on
    Bank Gothic. Well spotted Herr S."
