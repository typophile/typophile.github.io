  body: "Thanks for your reply! Do you not think the slight differences might have
    been caused by an unevenness in the inking when it was screened?\r\n\r\nIf this
    is hand-lettered, what typefaces come close it? I want to use something quite
    like this for a project I am working on at the moment. Cooper is the closest I've
    found so far, but it looks a little less formal to me somehow, & I am not wild
    about the capital 'R' in Cooper. Is there anything else?\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "The uneven quality is probably due to either a) human error introduced into
    the process of hand-cutting the Rubylith mask; or b) intentional funkiness.\r\n\r\nTo
    find something similar, you might search for seventeenth- and eighteen-century
    typefaces; alternately, you might consider this.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/saturday-morning-toast/\r\n\r\nsame
    na\xEFve kinda vibe, although the R is definitely different. The unusual take
    on that letter will probably be hard to match..."
