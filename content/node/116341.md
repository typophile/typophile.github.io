  body: I'm a bit embarrassed with this one as PDF font properties reveal it's '[[https://www.daltonmaag.com/news/161.html|BTSans]]'.
    Should be the custom typeface designed by Dalton Maag in 1999 and exclusive for
    British Telecommunications plc (BT).

  body: Blimey! So will I be able to find it or use it? Thanks for the investigation
    but why embarrassed?

  body: "Even if you'd be able to find it, you couldn't use it as it's an exclusive
    typeface for British Telecom. So definitely not available to sell or use.\r\nAnd
    I'm feeling embarrassed because it means now we know it's a BT exclusive font,
    the author of this design has probably acquired it illegally and at least (if
    he worked for BT) used it without any permission..."

  body: I've been researching online and it appears that BT now has a new font to
    replace this one (also designed by Dalton Maag) so it is out of service. I do
    not have any other examples of it. Do you know of anything very similar that I
    could use - I really like it.
