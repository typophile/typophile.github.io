</blockquote>

Do you agree that the person giving an answer is not responsible for the question, but only the answer? Are you sure Akira is agreeing with your morality simply by confirming the ID (which he actually never did)? Could you explain your interpretation of Akira's second post in particular?

How to identify plagiarism is a good question, and it might take a team of talents to do so. Do you think we have such a team here? :-)  And I certainly agree that people depend on other people's morality. Isn't that a rule of society as a whole, and Typophile in particular? And no matter what a society is doing, isn't somebody's own behavior his own responsibility?

For myself, when I take back an answer it's usually not easy, and I think it's never too late to make a difference (especially considering these threads can be referred to). The stage for tomorrow is set today.

BTW, I wasn't taking a shot at Nick Curtis - in fact we're sort of friends. I was simply making an observation, and he would probably confirm it. And don't you think it's relevant that different people elect to work with outfits like Autumn Leaves differently, based on their pattern of behavior?

Am I wrong that you now believe AL Sandra to be unethically made? If that's true, can you explain why it's too late to click the edit button?

Do you really think we need lawyers to identify plagiarism? And if I were a lawyer, would you edit your references to AL Sandy?

As for Nick: I made an observation that helps get a handle on this particular case. BTW are you sure Nick prefers you to me? But anyway how does that affect how you or I should behave?

And please desist from personal attacks on my character, especially since I'm not treating you that way.

You need lawyers to enforce morality: lawsuits, compensation, and prison time all help, but against the wrong doers, not the font id sleuths.

Do you think I should not repeat questions that I feel are important that I feel are being ignored?

If you insult me, do you think I should demand an apology?

I actually feel Nick is probably <em>more</em> worthy and moral than most any large font house. The relevant observation I was trying to make is that just because somebody gives away (or sells for a very modest fee) his rights to a font doesn't mean everybody else (specifically here Linotype and E&F) do that too. Do you agree?

Do you feel it's immoral to help somebody acquire a font that you feel is immoral? Giving the benefit of the doubt: Is there perhaps a greater good one can have in mind?

Do you think that if somebody accuses somebody of plagiarism but then realizes he was wrong, he should make amends?

And can you explain why you find Linotype's and E&F prices immoral? How much should a font cost? Does that depend on how good it is?

Don't you think it's relevant to point out the difference between somebody who charges little for his fonts -and has often given them away- versus outfits like Linotype and E&F? And will you be addressing how you think Autumn Leaves is handling the designs from the latter two foundries? No pressure though, it's entirely up to you.

I agree with you that you need lawyers to <em>enforce</em> morality (assuming you even believe that Law is always moral...) but do you think an individual needs lawyers to hit the edit button once he realizes he made a mistake? Is it immoral -or is it simply humbling- to remove a reference to a font you come to believe is immoral? And do you think Typophile needs to be an immoral place because there are immoral people elsewhere? I'm confident that you don't think so.

If you get around to answering my previous questions, I feel that would be morally helpful. Just my personal opinion.

There are different standards on what actually amounts to plagiarism so no, we don’t all agree on that unfortunately.

For me, no without question.

I’d like to think that we all agree as Pablo says, but based on some of the arguments put forward here recently in debates on the issue I don’t believe that is actually the case.</div>
