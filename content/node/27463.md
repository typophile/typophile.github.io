  I need to create fonts for both Windows and Mac. Any advice on these programs or
  suggestions for other font editors?\r\n"

    body: "Fontlab is what I use, but they've recently picked up Fontographer after
      an 8-year slump -- it works great under OSX (both G5 and Intel versions, though
      it's not Universal yet).\r\n\r\nIt's cheaper than FontLab ($349 as opposed to
      $649), and will probably fill the bill just fine. You only need FontLab if you
      are creating OpenType fonts. I don't know of ANY music font that is supplied
      in this format.\r\n\r\nhttp://fontlab.com/Font-tools/Fontographer/"

  body: "I\u2019d say that you should make your font in \"Windows TrueType\" (.ttf)
    format, which works on Windows and Mac OS X. All programs (FontCreator, TypeTool,
    Fontographer, FontLab Studio) allow you to do that. Since you say your funds are
    limited, the shootout indeed will happen between TypeTool and FontCreator. As
    I work for Fontlab Ltd., I'd argue that TypeTool is a bit more easier to work
    with, although FontCreator has some nice features that TypeTool currently lacks.
    I can mention, however, that we're working on TypeTool 3, which I believe will
    offer unbeatable features for the price. Of course, if you buy TypeTool 2 now,
    you'll be able to upgrade to TypeTool 3. \r\n\r\nBoth TypeTool and FontCreator
    offer demo versions, so I would just go ahead and try them out! \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam
