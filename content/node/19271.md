  body: "Some people like the \"Q\"s that Luc[as] de Groot makes. The original Caslon
    Italic has a killer \"Q\". I like \"Q\"s where the tail cuts in -and removes-
    part of the body, like the Italic one here: http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Emerson.gif\r\n\r\nBTW,
    if you can get a hold of Rookledge's \"Typefinder\",\r\nit has a section towards
    the end that shows hundreds of\r\ndifferent variants of each letter, indexed to
    the fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the usage is and the nature of the client.

    a cool \"q\". So does Eidetic's italic:\r\nhttp://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PEidIt.html
    _\r\nAnd I think my Cristaal's \"q\" is kinda nice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It's an alternative in Griffo's 1503 italic. The shape of the bowl is closer
    to that of ordinary q than that of Q.
