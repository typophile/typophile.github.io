  we'd like to use a font that closely matches the original, if at all possible.  Does
  anyone know how I can get my hands on the original font or have a suggestion for
  a font (or fonts) that could be used to approximate the look of the original?  We
  only need to recreate the title of the show.  Thanks for any help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Closer

    have any ideas for the "E"?
