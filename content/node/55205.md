  top notch design agencies from southern California, (namely from San Diego, Orange
  County or Los Angeles). I'm mostly interested in agencies doing graphic design in
  the field of brand identity design (logos, identities, packaging, branding). But
  why not also quality advertising agencies. Any established design agencies in Orange
  County?\r\n\r\nAnd outside Cali, design agencies from Seattle interest me too.\r\n\r\nThank
  you\r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\n\r\n"
