    buildings to me. And I'd avoid using thin lines to represent pages; they become
    too thin when the logo is used in a small size.\r\n\r\nThese concepts are a good

    either though. maybe more classic/established is what i'm trying to achieve. I

    rotate the symbol, but rather make the book more bookish:\r\n1. I'd make pages
    a bit thinner and round shaped coming from the centre\r\n2. Change book cover
    so spine will have the outfacing barrel\r\n\r\nGlobe's lines will have to change
    as well because they're not placed by rules of cosinus/sinus calculations so the
    feeling of round globe is a bit lost.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think the first two work
    very well. Even though you've put so much time into those I'm afraid it didn't
    get very far and seems like a dead end."

    one of the top 5 most overused images in logos, and your treatment is far from
    taking it somewhere fresh.  The book array had merit, and I think the main problems
    were refinement of the execution.  Keep pushing this one, you are getting there!

  body: i totally agree about the globe fact. i'm hoping to define it a little more,
    probably not revolutionize the idea by any means, but hope to give a slight twist
    in hope that it will stand out from previous globe-like designs. I've not completely
    abandoned the previous concepts. just taking a step back for now in hopes of seeing
    a unique approach to it. thoughts are always welcomed. thanks luma.

  body: "Sounds like you already agree with this, but I'd avoid the globe concept
    unless you can do something really fresh with it. As Luma Vine mentioned its an
    overused image.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do like the fact that the globe starts to communicate
    the global network access idea, which the fountain pen & book concepts don't.
    \ But it needs to be done in a fresher way.  Do a Google Images search for \"globe
    logo\" and you'll find tons of similar, unimaginative globes, but among them you'll
    also find a few examples of how a globe can be done a little differently (the
    at&t logo, for instance). "

  body: "Mauro, I may be jumping into this thread too late to be helpful, but here
    are my thoughts for what they are worth. Publishing is not one business. In broad
    terms, it's two businesses with very different (though overlapping) markets. \r\nFirst,
    there's entertainment, where you find books like you used to find in your corner
    bookstore (fiction, literary nonfiction, travel, humor, children's books, etc.).
    This segment of book publishing provides the same value to its audience as magazines,
    movies, television, and games. \r\nThe other publishing business is information
    and education, such as textbooks and reference books. People don't buy these for
    fun, they buy them because they need the <em>content</em>. And they'll choose
    the cheapest and most efficient way to get the content. Although <em>information</em>
    and <em>education</em> are missing from your keywords list, they are (or should
    be) part of your client's mission. The value your client offers their audience
    isn't the delivery system, it's the <em>content</em>, and the convenience of getting
    it without the limitations of a physical document. \r\nA logo that reminds me
    of physical documents (books, pens) might undermine the client's value proposition.
    Ideas and learning are intangibles, and therefore hard to incorporate into a visual
    symbol, but that's what your client is offering."

    what you've described, entertainment and education. \r\n\r\n@Matt.C - it will
    more then likely exist online as a header or possible marketing material. So,
    size will vary from 1\" to banner size. So far, the logo(s) size pretty clearly
    with some challenges on the book detail, which I'm hoping to address and find
    solutions."
