  body: "Thank you so much everyone! Not sure about Caslon because of the J, but Typonine
    and Dala Floda are spot on.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else has any suggestions of great
    stencil serifs \u2014 please let me know :)\r\nI specifically remember a great
    one being used in Dwell Magazine that I can't find too. Thanks again!"
