body: I'm typesetting a book that contains urls - some of them are really long. Both
  Quark and InDesign default not to break the names, which results in some mighty
  bad word spacing. Does anybody know the protocol with this? It would look much better
  to break them but would that confuse people - make them think there's a hyphen in
  the url? I just ran into this problem while reading the NYTimes - they don't break
  the url, but they also are not known for their typesetting finesse either (lots
  of widows & orphans). The problem is particularly glaring in justified type.

    >\r\n\r\nAll that said, you may want to suggest they don't bother with this. A
    few arguments:\r\n\r\n - Long URLs in print will never be typed in by hand. People
    are lazy\r\n - they are ugly and hard to typeset\r\n - the longer the URL, the
    more likely it's going to a very specific\r\n   page/bit of data on the site and
    the more likely it's going to  \r\n   rot than a shorter url.\r\n\r\nFor instance,
    this URL:\r\n\r\nwww.ourcompany.com/products/fancy-yellow-hammer \r\n\r\nis more
    likely to rot faster than:\r\n\r\nwww.ourcompany.com/products/\r\n\r\nwhich is
    more likely to rot faster than:\r\n\r\nwww.ourcompany.com\r\n\r\nSo, if linking
    to fancy yellow hammers, in print, I'd suggest they use:\r\n\r\nvisit the products
    section of our web site at < www.ourcompany.com > to find our selection of hammers."

  body: "^ ugh. The forum automatically puts URLs on their own lines, but I think
    the point comes across.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a better option/best compromise would be
    to footnote all of the URLs.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about it is that the first
    link in the footnotes could go to a page that the author maintains:\r\n\r\nwww.publisher.com/thebook/links\r\n\r\nThat
    way a reader of the book can go right to that page and access all the URLs referenced
    in the publication. A bonus to the reader, if the author is willing, is that those
    links can be updated as needed."

  body: "The rules I think make sense (and I believe this is close to CMS) for breaking
    long URLs:\r\n\r\n1. Never use a hyphen to indicate a break\r\n2. Never break
    directly after a hyphen as it creates ambiguity\r\n3. Send anything that could
    be construed as terminal punctuation to the next line (. ! ?)\r\n4. Break directly
    after all other analphabetics "

  body: "I totally agree with Darrel and Eric. Break up a long url but do not use
    dashes. You may want to enclose the url or set the url in <em>italics.</em>\r\n\r\nTwo
    other ideas:\r\n* Leave off the http:// to save yourself 7 characters, or even
    the www. as in Google.com.\r\n* Try using SnipUrl.com, NotLong.com, or TinyUrl.com
    to shorten monsterously long addresses. SnipUrl also gives registered users the
    option of selecting their own keyword instead of the default alpha-numeric value.
    E.g., these two take you to the same place:\r\nhttp://snurl.com/parsi\r\nhttp://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174838/peter_galbraith_the_iranian_conundrum\r\n\r\nI
    do a newsletter and run into this all the time. I prefer to break after logical
    groupings or split words where they would normally be hyphenated. I also think
    it's best not to split after periods, hyphens, or underscores (as Eric said) so
    readers don't think that's the end of a sentence or part of the URL."

    dot, and hoping the reader is smart enough to follow it to the next line. I don't
    have the choice of shortening the url to the home page... they want to spell out
    the full url. I'll inquire as to whether brackets are ok. I've also used the device
    of using a different font for the url to set it apart, but not in this case."

  body: "I think that one of the problems with breaking URLs is when it's done in
    a digital document. I've noticed some in browsers, if you cut and paste a URL
    that's broken, sometimes you get garbage inserted into the ULR, like a space character
    reference: %20, inserted in the middle of the URL.\r\n\r\nIf the document is only
    for printing, you don't have to worry about this, so it's less of an issue.\r\n\r\njason

  body: "Where I work we are also very fond of using long URLs and usually smack in
    the middle of a paragraph. \r\n\r\nI break them after a slash, and work with the
    paragraph rag and hyphenation to make it as painless as possible. I'm also in
    the position to lightly re-word on occasion, which helps. I sometimes also italicize
    the URL, which I find helps distinguish it from the rest of the text.\r\n\r\nI
    feel your pain. If it were up to me all of the URLs would be at the end of the
    paragraph with no introduction. (Who really needs to read \"Please visit our web
    site at:\" to figure out what they're supposed to do?)\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents."

  body: hrant and i were posting on this very subject a couple of months ago. he suggested
    breaking the lines with the " ^ " symbol, and while i think it's an interesting
    idea, it's not very aesthetic.  i know the situation though -- a couple of years
    ago i was designing a magazine that every month had a page listing urls, and the
    page was set up on a five column grid. those long ones were murder.

  body: "A lot of this advice really isn\u2019t correct.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do not
    attempt to use delimiters, especially less-than or greater-than, except in the
    easily avoided circumstance where readers cannot tell if ending or surrounding
    punctuation is part of the URL. A subtle font change (does not have to be monospaced;
    I don't see how italic really works) is adequate in most cases. People do not
    understand that delimiters are for <em>E-mail programs</em> so that URLs are not
    broken and become clickable. Even if you had to use delimiters, they wouldn\u2019t
    be actual less-than/greater-than characters but set delimiters from math (easily
    available in the Symbol font).</li>\r\n<li>Test every URL without www. If it works
    (some servers are misconfigured and it won\u2019t), then do not use http://www
    in the printed URL.</li>\r\n<li>Do not use a TinyURL-like service. Do <em>not</em>.
    You are entrusting the validity of the URL to a third-party service. When TinyURL
    (or equivalent) goes tits-up, there will never be a way for the reader to locate
    the original URL.</li>\r\n<li>Experience has shown \u2013 ask <a href=\"http://adactio.com\">Jeremy
    Keith</a> about this \u2013 that the right way to go is to either maintain a list
    of URLs on your site or maintain a list of URL <em>aliases</em> on your site that
    you can update if the destination URL changes. Of course the destination is not
    your responsibility, but for the presumed lifetime of the book you might want
    to make that effort. For example, http://typophile.com/node/37994 could be listed
    as mybook.org/howtolink which, when typed into a browser, sends you straight to
    http://typophile.com/node/37994 by a Redirect 301 command.</li>\r\n<li>Break <em>before</em>
    a dot, not after. Yes, this puts a dot at the beginning of a line. It also eliminates
    ambiguity. Certainly break after slashes. Those locations are perfect for optional-return
    characters, available since WordPerfect 5.1, present in DTP programs, and almost
    completely unused.</li>\r\n<li>Use a character style for URLs. I would do an onscreen
    check of every paragraph containing that style before going to press. You never
    know what kind of linebreaks are gonna happen, and the wrong kind are always gonna
    happen at the last minute.</li>\r\n<li> Try to avoid hyphens at all; if you look
    around you\u2019ll find they're rare. A bigger issue, undiscussed here, is shitty
    Microsoft or CMS URLs that are a mile long and contain a dozen parameters and
    arguments separated by ampersands. Do you really think those URLs are going to
    last? If so, should you even publish them?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014

    pointing out that WIRED, IIRC, started that technique in print eons ago. Not that
    that makes it right, but WIRED is one of the first publications to have web savvy
    style guides.\r\n\r\nThe main reason to have a delimiter in print is to avoid
    the punctuation at the end of a sentence. The alternative would be to never end
    a sentence with a URL.\r\n\r\nPersonally, though, the more I think about this,
    the more I think I'd prefer footnoting the URLs if at all possible.\r\n\r\n\"Try
    to avoid hyphens at all; if you look around you\u2019ll find they\u2019re rare.\"\r\n\r\nThey're
    increasingly common in URLs as people jump on the SEO bandwagon. Wordpress, for
    instance, uses hyphens in most of its URLs.\r\n\r\n\"Hypertext transport, usually
    \u2014 but not always. Do not omit the http:// prefix; it is an indispensable
    part of the URL, and not at all superfluous.\"\r\n\r\nwhile true, I'm not aware
