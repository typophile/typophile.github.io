  but designed for screens and specifically without the lower-case l that looks like
  I and 1.  I have looked at Agenda and pretty much like it,  but am curious if their
  are other faces in this style that should be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n-Moe

    found Lato which looks like it might work for me. \r\n\r\nRyan, I had no idea
    about Eric Gill's personal life. That's <em>really</em> messed up. That way overshadows
    gripes about him copying Johnston!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Gill didn't copy Johnston, they were collaborators and worked on the Underground
    typeface together in its early stages of development for quite some time. IIRC,
    Johnston wanted to give Gill joint credit, but Gill said not to worry about it.
