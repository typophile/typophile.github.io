  body: I'd like feedback on the overall design and the type layout. Does the cover
    need more elements to complete it or do you think what I've done is finished?
    thank you.

  body: Right now, the only thing that bugs me is where 'season' is in small caps.
    It doesn't have the same height as the numerals and it makes the 'th' in '47th'
    look funny.

  body: "I would personally think that aligning all three of the small lines of information
    to the same width would strengthen the grouping you  having in the middle. As
    well, the dates being screened seems an odd choice. I would think 47th season
    isn't something to hide.\r\n\r\nThe use of Bookman seems at odds with the use
    of Goudy. The use of the single script is a nice start at adding flair, but I
    think it is also at odds with the Bookman. The problem of using Bookman italic
    is that the letters don't flow one to the next and just jar against one another.
    I wonder if the Goudy Italic might do better?\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself wanting
    to add a white stroke to something that is already light, I would suggest simply
    making the cream color lighter instead of using the white stroke.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The touching letters, especially the ri in enriching, are not an elegant choice
    to my eye. A bit more tracking or individual kerning would make them better.

  body: "To me the title looks a little small on the page area, I also get the impression
    that the script S has been rotated and reads a little like P. The tracking on
    the dates and 47th season is too much. And the image looks light on the song/enriching
    aspect.\r\nTim"
