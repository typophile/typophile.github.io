body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Writing Systems]] : [[Syllabaries]] : Cypriot</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  Cypriot [[syllabary]] was used in Cyprus from the eleventh century BCE to around
  the end of the third century BCE. It was used for writing two languages: the Arcado-Cypriot
  dialect of ancient [[Greek]] and an unknown language referred to as \"Eteo-Cypriot\"
  that was used in parts of central Cyprus during the classical period. The script
  contains at least 55 phonetic characters plus a punctuation mark (used for separating
  words or word groups) and a simple system of numerals.\r\n\r\nIn origin the Cypriot
  syllabary is clearly related to [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]], though not especially
  closely; the immediate ancestor is probably the poorly known Cypro-Minoan script
  of the Late Bronze Age. During the archaic and classical periods, the Cypriot syllabary
  existed in two quite different regional varieties: the \"standard\" syllabary used
  in central and eastern Cyprus and the \"Paphian\" syllabary used in western Cyprus.
  Numerous other variations of glyph shape exist within the known corpus, some probably
  regional, some probably chronological, and some probably technical or stylistic.\r\n\r\nOnly
  inscriptions on durable materials have survived: carved in stone, incised in clay,
  painted on clay, stamped on metal coins, or incised in metal. Most surviving inscriptions
  are very short; only a few are longer than 100 characters, and only one, the Idalium
  tablet, exceeds 1000 characters.\r\n\r\nThe Cypriot syllabary is a simple [[script]]
  without any shaping behavior, written in horizontal lines. The standard syllabary
  was normally written from right to left; the Paphian syllabary was usually written
  from left to right at Paphus, but usually from right to left around Curium.\r\n\r\nThe
  phonetic characters represent vowels or CV syllables. This structure is ill-suited
  to the Greek language, which (like most Indo-European languges) is prone to complex
  consonant clusters. Therefore, multiple characters may be needed to write what would
  be a single syllable in speech: for example, the phrase \"\u0394\u03AC\u03BC\u03B1\u03C4\u03C1\u03B9
  \u03BA\u1F70\u03C2 \u039A\u03CC\u03C1\u03B1\u03B9\" (\"to Demeter and Kore\"), pronounced
  as six syllables, is written with nine characters, <em>ta-ma-ti-ri ka-se ko-ra-i</em>.
  It will also be noted that the syllabary omits many phonemic distinctions used in
  the spoken language, such as voice and aspiration.\r\n\r\nThe Cypriot syllabary
  has been included in the [[Unicode]] standard since version 4.0, and is located
  with other historic scripts in Plane 1.\r\n\r\nFor further information, see:\r\nO.
