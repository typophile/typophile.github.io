body: The headlines in my document are Adobe Garamond. My supervisor usually wants
  all type to be tracked super close together. My problem is that when I have a letter
  combination like "Th" I would have to make the serifs touching or even overlapping
  to have consistent spacing in the headline.  Is it okay to overlap in this way?
  Traditionally speaking, of course. Thanks for your opinions.

    however, that Adobe Garamond (at least in the OpenType Pro version) has a Th ligature,

    Garamond, and not Th, but it's what came to hand.)\r\nIt's a blobby face, as is
    Garamond to degree, so the serifs can be fudged together and custom modified to
    get a smooth effect.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HZ.jpg]"

  body: "Some more basic typesetting (copy setting) advice:\r\n\r\nNowadays, most
    text designs are \"optimally\" space for basic readability, so changing tracking
    to the extremes plus or minus will affect one's reading experience.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have a general rule of spacing ALL typefaces at the SAME tracking (like all
    12 pt. copy at -5 tracking in Quark) you will also have readability issues. Each
    typeface has different characteristics that you should take into consideration
    before universally tracking everything.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what it looks
    like on the screen. It's the final printed piece that needs to be reviewed, evaluated
    and adjusted if necessary. So in reality, you can't make arbitrary spacing decisions
    on the screen without knowing how it looks in print.\r\n\r\nAt least you should
    learn somethings about type even though your supervisor instructs you to the contrary.\r\n"

      this same supervisor changed the H&Js in Quark to -3 tracking on all the computers.
      He thinks it's more readable. I always change it based on the typeface I'm using.
      \ \r\n\r\nI think learning what no to do can be valuable, if a bit frustrating
      at times. "

  body: Cris it depended on the client, most bank clients I've ever had refused to
    hypenate. The H&Js for other clients could be rather terrible but they tried (type
    houses). I don't know if its just a bank thing but they will have an awful river
    rather than hypenate. Maybe they don't want people to read what they are printing?
