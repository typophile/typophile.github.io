  nice French Type from a book made in the 1908, the editor is Louis-Michaud, the
  \"Imprimerie\" is F.Schmidt and they were working in Paris. \r\nI would like to
  know something about this type, but in Holland there are not may specimen of French
  foundries. Can someone help me? \r\nmany thanks\r\n \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ex02_3733.jpg]"

  body: "I researched this in the Jaspert 'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces' and Updike's
    'Printing Types' and could not find anything to match it. However, there was something
    that seemed very familiar about the odd script-like letterforms, also like a vertical
    italic, and it reminded me of Benton's 'Announcement Roman'. Many of the lower
    case letters are similar, although many are not. This typeface has been revived
    by Canada Type as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/odette/\">Odette</a>.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Oh my ... that is delightful (that 'g'!). Announcement Roman is what immediately
    came to mind for me as well. And that typeface wasn't even around for another
    decade.

  body: "I had missed this thread, but did run into\r\nits iteration on the ATypI
    list; here's my\r\nreply on that list in case anybody is still\r\ncurious about
    it:\r\n\r\n\"\r\nThat font looked familiar to me, and I immediately looked at
    my\r\ncopies of Audin's books, since that's such a singular repository\r\nfor
    funky old French stuff. The roman is shown in figure 125 of\r\nvolume 3 as \"Type
    Beaudoire\" #2 (the #1 is actually even more\r\nfascinating). The italic is a
    few pages down in figure 141, shown\r\nas the font \"XXe Si\xE8cle\"* by Mayeur.
    I remember from the time I\r\ntranslated Ponot's article about Perrin that there's
    a connection\r\nbetween Perrin, Beaudoire and Mayeur (and Marquet). IIRC one\r\nof
    them swiped a design from one other, with the help of another,\r\nor something.
    :-)  I can find out if it's important.\r\n\r\n* Sure sounds turn-of-the-century...\r\n\r\nI'm
    pretty sure Ponot passed away recently, but\r\nthere is somebody who might be
    able to help you\r\na bit more: http://typophile.com/node/8576\r\n\r\nAlso, more
    on Beaudoire: http://typophile.com/node/7596\r\n\"\r\n\r\nAlso, it turns out that
    Francesca has\r\nsince made a font of it - congrats!\r\nhttp://www.lookleft.it/index.php?/typedesign/duchesse/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
