  Dalton-Maag website</a>, I was wondering if <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27701.html?1078364411"
  target="_blank"> this request</a>  <BR>might have been their <a href="http://www.daltonmaag.com/custom/fonts/coop.html"
  target="_blank"> custom font for Coop</a>? It&#39;s a pity the samples  <BR>are
  too small and far from complete, but the overall feel and look  <BR>seem to be pretty
  close. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I&#39;m having a real hard time connecting the
  text  <BR>of the sample to &#34;Switzerland&#39;s second largest supermarket chain&#34;...

  body: It&#39;s close, but the tail of the &#39;a&#39; and Coop&#39;s longer top
    stroke on the <BR>&#39;f&#39; make me lean towards a &#34;no&#34;. Too bad DM&#39;s
    samples are so small.

  body: The fact that Trebuchet&#39;s designer, Vincent Connare, works at Dalton-Maag
    adds weight to this idea. The &#34;dippy&#34; font resembles Trebuchet very strongly.

  body: Good eye, Mark. Though, from my experience, it&#39;s much better  <BR>than
    Connare&#39;s work. But I can imagine he had a role.
