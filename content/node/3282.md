body: Hello folks, <BR>I have been asked to track down a typeface called Volgare.
  I&#39;ve done some research on the net and found out it was developed by Stephen
  Farrell from Slip Studios. Most of his fonts are licenced through [T-26] but not
  this one. Does anyone know the font and if it is commercially available?

    annoying as seeing a typeface  <BR>lauded in the annuals and then not being able
    to obtain it.  <BR>dhall

    sure there&#39;s a way to track down an email for Farrell - maybe through Emigre.

  body: 'Paul, I am a HUGE fan of Volgare. There is little information about it on
    the web. Here is the best and only page that describes Volgare: <a href="http://www.altx.com/ebr/ads/ebr6/farrell/page3.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.altx.com/ebr/ads/ebr6/farrell/page3.htm</a> &#40;it&#39;s
    a pain in the &#149;&#149;&#149; to navigate though&#41;. <BR> <BR>Volgare took
    Stephen 4 years to make and you can tell in its detailed construction. All the
    information I know about it is in that link above, so I encourage you to read
    that. If you want a copy of the font you have to call Stephen and ask him to send
    you a CD with the font, it costs $75. It is well worth the price. <BR> <BR>He
    is also mentioned in this article on Design Observer <a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/000021.html"

    mentioned there, Volgare was on display at the Cooper Hewitt&#39;s original design

    added stylizations when I attempted a similar thing a few years ago."
