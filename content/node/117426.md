    in 1896. Haas produced a type named Normal Grotesque based on Standard but the
    designs are different. No date for the Haas version is given, nor does Jaspert
    indicate Normal Grotesque was ever called Akzidenz-Grotesk.\r\n\r\nWiki says Haas
    produced Akzidenz Grotesk, implying they introduced it. The Wiki also lists both
    Akzidenz-Grotesk and Normal Grotesk. Someone who knows the true history would
    be welcome to clean up these discrepancies.\r\n\r\nJust guessing, but it is quite
    likely Haas may have introduced Normal Grotesque as a \"similar to\" type then
    later licensed Akzidenz-Grotesk from Berthold because they produced other Berthold
    designs later on."

    Akzidenz-Grotesk, in 1896.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt rather was the other way round.
    Berthold introduced the first weight of Akzidenz Grotesk in 1896. It was Akzidenz
    Grotesk schmalfett (bold condensed). In English speaking countries Akzidenz Grotesk
    was sold as Standard.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the metal type era, \u2018produced\u2019
    does not mean \u2018introduced\u2019, let alone \u2018designed\u2019. So when
    you find a Linotype catalogue which lists Akzidenz Grotesk as \u2018produced by\u2019
    Linotype, it does not imply that Linotype designed that typeface. The same applies
    to foundry type in a similar way in many cases.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1950s Berthold
    licensed Akzidenz Grotesk to Linotype. G\xFCnther Gerhard Lange told me that the
    idea behind it was that the availability of Akzidenz Grotesk on Linotype\u2019s
    line caster would enhance sales of Berthold\u2019s foundry type. In those days,
    the Swiss Typography movement promoted the idea of specifying a single type family
    for house style projects (corporate design). In order to be able to design and
    produce corporate brochures and magazines with the typeface(s) as specified in
    a corporate design manual, the availability of such typefaces on line casters
    (such as Linotype and Intertype) or typesetting machines such as Monotype thus
    became crucial. \r\n\r\nFrom my experience in doing some research on the origin
    of German sans serifs, I think that the listings at the Klingspor Museum website
    are rather accurate.\r\nhttp://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftgiessereien/Haas/Haas.pdf\r\nBut
    the trouble with listings such as Jaspert, the Klingspor site and Wikipedia, is
    that they do not mention a source per entry \u2026 Unfortunately the entry of
    Akzidenz Grotesk in the PDF on the Haas foundry at the Klingspor site does not
    tell as from which year Haas has been producing Akzidenz Grotesk. Also the PDF
    does not include images which show how the typefaces that were produced by Haas
    such as Akzidenz Grotesk and Normal-Grotesque may have looked like. It would probably
    take to go through all of the sources mentioned at the last page to find out where
    Hans Reichardt (the author of this PDF) obtained this information from \u2026\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    Indra Kupferschmid did so and found this specimen of Normal-Grotesk - Grotesque
    by the Haas\u2019sche Schriftgiesserei here:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/kupfers/6198185700/\r\nThis
    specimen tells us that Normal Grotesk and Akzidenz Grotesk are different designs.
    The notes by Indra also tell us that we cannot rely blindly on names or their
    spelling. \r\n\r\nThe inaccuracies, incompleteness and missing references of Jaspert,
    Berry & Johnson\u2019s Encyclopaedia of Typefaces and the Klingspor PDFs, combined
    with other people compiling informations from \u2018mixed sources\u2019 leads
    to curiosities such as this one here in the listing of typefaces as produced by
    Haas:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_Type_Foundry \r\nProfil, 1947, Eugen
    and Max Lenz, Bitstream\r\nOf course, Bitstream (founded in 1981) has nothing
    to do with the \u2018origin\u2019 of Profil (issued by Haas in 1947) \u2026"

  body: "When talking about the history of Akzidenz Grotesk and Neue Haas Grotesk
    / Helvetica, one has to keep in mind that Franz\xF6sische Grotesk was one of the
    models that was used for the design of Neue Haas Grotesk / Helvetica. \r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/kupfers/5933679233/\r\nOn
    its turn, Franz\xF6sische Grotesk origins in Breite Grotesque by Schelter & Giesecke.
    Of which I think that it also served as a model for Berthold\u2019s Akzidenz Grotesk.
    \ But the history of sans serif in Germany does not start with Schelter\u2019s
    Breite Grotesque, of course \u2026 ;\u2013)"

    Helvetica was based on a generically named Grotesque with some number behind it.
    I forgot the number."
