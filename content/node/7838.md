  body: It looks like some form of OCR or something to that extent... but those numerals
    have thrown me off to no end.

  body: The industrial shapes of the characters and those numerals  <BR>make me believe
    this could be some license plate-inspired  <BR>design.

    back of my head nagging me, telling me: &#34;It&#39;s that font,  <BR>check it&#34;,
    and then I postpone it and forget about it. And then  <BR>after waaaay too long
    I finally decide: &#34;Well, I&#39;d better check  <BR>that one at last&#34; and
    bang - I was right! Oh, bugger ...'
