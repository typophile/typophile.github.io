  but I need it to not be free. \r\n\r\nReally, any very rounded sans serif with various
  weights would be great. The closest I've found is Sofia Pro Rounded, but if you
  have any other suggestions, it'd be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sp-720_5482.png]"

    would have suggested commissioning an improved derivative of Quicksand* but sadly
    it's under the OFL license, which does not allow that. So I think your best bet
    is to contact the designer for a professional version of it.\r\n\r\n* See all

  body: "Hrant, what makes you think that OFL license does not allow commissioned
    derivatives/improvements?\r\nI think you are mistaken about that. The whole point
    of the OFL is to allow derivatives, and those can be commissioned. In fact, they
    usually are."

    of a derivative for money, it does allow somebody to get paid to create a proprietary
    derivation for a client. Correct?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>Although OFL does not allow the general redistribution of a derivative
    for money</blockquote>\r\nIt allows the redistribution of a derivative for money,
    but not by itself.\r\nFor example, you can embed the font into an iPad app and
    sell the app, but not just the font by itself.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>it does allow
    somebody to get paid to create a proprietary derivation for a client</blockquote>\r\nIt
    allows anybody to get paid to create a derivative for a client, but it must remain
    OFL, not proprietary.\r\nAlso, if the font uses RFN, you may need to a) Rename
    it, or b) Ask permission to continue using the same name."
