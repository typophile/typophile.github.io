body: "I put the pre-alpha (but very usable for low enough resolutions) version of
  monospaced scalable variant of Unifont font to [[http://ilyaz.org/software/fonts]].\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIt
  is constructed by a scanner/stroke-designer backend running over the 16\xD78, 16\xD716
  bitmaps of Unifont.  The scanner/designer are written in Perl; the scanner is ready,
  the designer 70% ready.   (Of course, it turned out to be a much more complicated
  task than I expected at the start \u2014 6 months ago!)\r\nThe frontend converting
  strokes to a font is EXTREMELY primitive (cooked in a day, and hitting new and new
  bugs in FontForge \u2014 sigh\u2026).  So I'm afraid any critique at this moment
  would be very premature\u2026\r\nI'm hitting my head again and again with <code>.notdef</code>;
  it does not work in Windows console if I include U+0000 and U+0001 glyphs.  So currently
  I just omit these glyphs \u2014 is there any alternative?  The recommendations in
  [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm]] are not very helpful: how
  can one include <code>.null</code> into a monospaced font?\r\nAny help with this
  would be greatly appreciated."

    Consolas includes them...

      the sequence <code>.notdef/0002/0003/0004/0005/</code>etc, everything works
      OK.  Inserting glyphs named <code>0000/0001</code> after .notdef makes the glyph
      <code>0000</code> used instead of <code>.notdef</code>.\r\n\r\nConsolas has\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nStartChar:

      is contrary to M$ recommendations: CR should have non-0 width, second glyph
      should be named .null and it should have 0-width.  Moreover, M$ says that a
      console font should be monospaced \u2014 but above CR has width 0\u2026."

  body: "In a monospaced font, *all* glyphs should have the same advance width, and
    this overrides other recommendations such as that which says NULL should be zero-width.
    If a monospaced font contains glyphs that do not share the common width, it can
    cause major problems, because software tends to cache the width value for monospaced
    fonts.\r\n\r\nNote also that the proper name of this glyph is NULL, not .null.
    The only glyph in a font whose name begins with something other than A-z is .notdef."

    body: "Thanks, John! The question remaining is: what you say, is it just \u201Ccommon
      knowledge\u201D,  or is it documented somewhere? What I was quoting was the
      cited MS's document; one does not expect it to be even close to being perfect,
      but it would be nice if one knew something more authoritative, and still kind
      of comprehensive.\r\n\r\nI do not say that your word is less authoritative than
      the MS's document; it it just that what you say is one (or two) tidbits at a
      time ;-).\r\n\r\nPlease bear with me, this is my first foray into non-bitmap
      world\u2026.  Of course, in what I released every char is of the same width
      \u2014 I just was not sure which card bits which when different recommendations
      are concerned.  \u2015 And note that in Consola 000D has width 0, contrary to
      \u201Cconsoleness\u201D \u2014 which for me implies being monospaced; and the
      recommendation above says that 000D should be non-0 width\u2026."

  body: With regard to glyph names, Consolas, like the other CT fonts, has a format
    3 post table, so does not contain any glyph names. The names you see in TTX or
    other tools are being generated by that software.
