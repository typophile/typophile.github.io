  help:\r\nI've recieved an inDesign document created on a mac, in which DIN Black
  and DIN Bold are used. \r\nAs I use a PC at work I needed to buy those two fonts,
  so I bought FF DIN Bold and Black which seemed to be the reference, and installed
  them. \r\nBut when I opened the inDesign document, it kept saying the DIN Bold and
  Black fonts were missing.\r\nIs there any way to make it understand it's the fonts
  I bought ? \r\nI think the problem is the name ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot to take the
  time to read my request, \r\n\r\nHave a good day !\r\n\r\nJon"

  body: "This does seem like a font name issue since you have a different version
    of DIN. In InDesign, if you go to Type > Find Font... it will show you all the
    fonts in your document. Choose the font you want to replace, then select a replacement
    under the Replace With area of the dialog.\r\n\r\nI would suggest comparing the
    two documents after replacing the font. Different versions of the same font could
    have varying metrics, and the formatting may change."
