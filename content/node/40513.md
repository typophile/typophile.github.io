  doing some mindless surfing over the holiday period. It looks really familiar to
  me, but I can't put a name to it. Can anyone here help? \r\n\r\nThanks, JP"

  body: Thanks very much for the swift response. It's not as familiar as I first thought
    - I'd never heard of this guy or his work before. He has some nicely bashed up
    fonts ;)
