  some help if anyone has experience or knowledge in this area. What I'm looking to
  compile is a list of the top 8-10 design or type related book publishers. This publisher
  would probably have to be in the United States, but I can still look into foreign
  publishers. I've been asked to help gather information that will hopefully lead
  to the publishing of an art book of sorts, filled from end to end with custom type.\r\n\r\nMy
  only find so far is: http://www.watsonguptill.com/ The obvious plan of attack is
  to hit the more design oriented bookstores, but I figured that I could throw this
  into the Typophile mix to see how you all feel.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Batty Publisher]] on your list to explore.

    putting <a href="http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books">Hyphen Press</a> on your
    list anyway.

  body: Perhaps my use of 'top' was the incorrect adjective. I'm trying to find as
    many as possible, then presenting the 8-10 I think would most likely publish this
    book to my co-worker!
