body: I'm new to graphic design, and am working on a logo for my knitwear brand. I'm
  not sure if I am making a mistake by using Bell Gothic as the typeface, since it
  was designed for smaller type. Any suggestion or criticism is welcome.

  body: The dp mark is nice, especially as there's a looping, weaving, knotted look
    to it. I think the rest is just a bit cold for knitwear. Have you tried setting
    the Spundone much smaller so it's as wide as the dp, and put it across the top
    or bottom?

  body: "With regards the mark - \"dp\" is a very common two letter combination and
    a popular choice for creating a monogram. It is very hard to make something unique
    out of these two letters. For example, see <a href=http://www.helveticbrands.ch/blog/evolution_of_dache_logo/>here</a>,
    which is just one person exploring various monogramming options. Another set of
    conceptes is <a href=http://www.flickr.com/groups/dataportability/pool/>here</a>,
    and there are plenty more over at logopond and similar sites. \r\n\r\nIn other
    words I would try and <em>not</em> do a monogram if it's at all an option."

  body: Interesting -- I used dp because they are my initials, and another organization
    had taken the domain spundone.com. However, I could use spundoneknits or something
    similar.

    are many possibilities here for wordplay around the subject... On 'spundon' (undone)-
    do you want people to think it's 'undone'? Just my thoughts...\r\n\r\n"
