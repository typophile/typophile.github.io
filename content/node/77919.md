  the M is different (also in body text)...the capital J is also different to Neuzeit
  S (at least the version i have)...can anyone help? is this a custom version of Neuzeit
  S or is there another version with alternative glyphs, or is it something else altogether???\r\nthanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/playground-web_4329.jpg]"
