body: "Greetings all,\r\n\r\nAfter quite a bit of work, I can finally do a release
  of my new display typeface. Since it's meant for display the level of detail is
  quite high, making it not really usable for body type. However, this is also an
  experiment in legibility, to see if some letterforms can be read or not, or if it's
  all contextual. I didn't design some characters since I didn't see a use for them
  in a header-only typeface.\r\n\r\nThe type family consists of a ornamented version,
  and a more subtle sans. Both use the same main shapes though, and are not completely
  redrawn. Since I wanted to make this typeface a capitals only , the lower case is
  used as a series of alternate capitals. I manly chose to do this since I wanted
  people to be able to type with it in less advanced text programs, which do not have
  full opentype support or glyph panels.\r\n\r\nWell, without further ado, here is
  a small specimen, showcasing usage in text, the complete alphabet and numerals.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.arthus.nl/files/web-specimen.pdf|Specimen]]\r\n[[http://www.arthus.nl|More

    legibility in regards to mane length, hoof width, etc...

  body: "The discussion would indeed prove to be fascinating, Especially to see the
    difference between the normal Unicorn typeface and the sans version (without horn)
    Also, what would your terminals/serifs be when your stroke is a rainbow (like
    with the numerals) I believe it should be pots of gold.\r\n\r\nDue to comments
    about usability, especially on machine stress, I made 'Unicorn light' available
    now as well, for if your machine isn't rainbow powered!.\r\n[[http://www.arthus.nl/files/light.zip|unicorn
