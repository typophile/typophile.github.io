  D&AD. We have five titles to  choose from and this my first version for 'The History
  of Mr Polly'. No back or spine designed yet, will post more tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis
  is supposed to show that Mr Polly is blind because he doesn't know what he want
  with his life and the fire symbolizes when he sets fire to his own shop so that
  he can escape from his miserable life.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is much appreciated.\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/polly2_5984.jpg]"

  body: "Nice poster, a little scary some of them :)\r\n\r\nThese are the three finished
    book covers. We already had our final crit, tutor liked them except for the fact
    that I used some stock images, which didn't go over so well. Apparently we are
    supposed to stick to all originial work as much as possible. It's not forbidden
    to use stock images but I prob should've photographed things like the blindfol
    and the suit myself. Dosen't really matter anyway, I'll prob do the two other
    covers for Kipps and Tono Bungay in the same style and add everything to my portfolio
    because it looks very nice :)\r\n\r\nStill if anyone has any feedback feel free
    to share because I will work on these some more so I can add them to my portfolio.\r\n\r\nr\r\npeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lewisham3_6489.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/annveronica3_4856.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/polly3_6225.jpg]"
