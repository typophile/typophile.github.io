  body: "So is Frank Spano a notorious gangster? His occupation -- hand written, not
    typed -- is \"ice dealer.\" I've heard of \"putting someone on ice\" as an euphemism
    for killing them...\r\nThere is a role playing game, Speakeasy Dollhouse, that
    includes the comment \"a speakeasy owner named Frank Spano, was shot.\"  \r\n---game
    explanation quote---\r\nThe show is the brainchild of artist and author Cynthia
    von Buhler, whose Italian immigrant grandfather, a speakeasy owner named Frank
    Spano, was shot and killed on a Manhattan street in 1935. Though the shooter was
    caught, his case was inexplicably dismissed, leaving the question of motive forever
    unanswered. \r\n---end game quote---\r\nsource http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/214593\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    this specimen is a prop?\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "I did mention Courier as an answer to \"what font would be the most similar
    to this font that is available to mac\".\r\nAssuming that, in this case, as a
    prop, monospacing and colour (so, no Courier New) is more important that letter
    shape.\r\nOtherwise, the already mentioned by Don American Typewriter also comes
    with every installation of Mac OS X."

    thread. There there was a single answer to both. Here you thoroughly answered
    (as usual) to the first and I tersely answered to the second.\r\n"

  body: "Don, I think it is a prop. No sig for the M.D. examiner... \r\n\r\nCopy of
    a blank hospital form itself is probably ligit. Text easy to set in Ps ...faking
    an M.D.'s signature tho seems to push the prop a little bit further than they
    were willing to go."

  body: "In 1935 a New York hospital would have most probably have used typewriters
    from US companies such as Underwood,  Remington, Smith Premier etc.\r\nAt the
    scale of your image I can't tell you the make or model used.\r\n\r\nDetails of
    typefaces used by these and other companies changed over the years. Some key letters
    to check are _4_, whether open or closed -- your sample is closed and _3_ -- whether
    round top or flat top -- your sample is flat top. Also whether the _g_ is one
    story, i.e. with a tail like a hook  or two story, i.e.  with a closed bowl at
    the bottom, like a pair of glasses -- your sample is two story. There are other
    features of your sample that you could seek to duplicate, like the ball at the
    end of the tail at the top of _6_, but most people would not notice this.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to duplicate the feel of a typewriter you need a monospaced font. If
    the font does not say then check the sample text _NMW_ or _nmw_. The _M_ and _W_
    should look squeezed so that the type key width is the same as _N_. All keys are
    the same width, so in a monospace typewriter font the _I_ and _i_ usually have
    very wide serifs to fill the space.\r\n\r\nSome monospace fonts that would work
    as substitutes:\r\nLTC Remington Typewriter, [no obvious discrepancies, a fairly
    high probability that this was the make used, & very cleanly engineered font]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-remington-typewriter/ Includes an italic
    designed by Frederic Goudy in 1927.\r\nRemington Elite [wrong _3_, but a fairly
    high probability that this was the make used, & very cleanly engineered font]
    \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/remington-elite-typewriter/\r\nUnderwood
    Typewriter  [no obvious discrepancies, a fairly high probability that this was
    the make used, & very cleanly engineered font] \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/underwood-typewriter/
    also http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/underwood-typewriter/\r\nSmith Premier NF
    [no obvious discrepancies & very cleanly engineered font] \r\nIntellecta Typewriter
    [no obvious discrepancies] \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/intellecta-typewriter/\r\nBulletin
    Typewriter [no obvious discrepancies] \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/bulletin-typewriter/\r\n\r\nIf
    you do not need a monospace font a good generic substitute is ITC American Typewriter
    https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-american-typewriter/ \r\n\r\nI did not
    include grunge or distressed faces. IMHO they are a waste of time for recreating
    documents.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nDeleted possibly controversial comment.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nI
    don't know if these otf fonts can be used on a Mac. If not there is always Courier,despite
    the  one story _g_.\r\nDon\r\n"
