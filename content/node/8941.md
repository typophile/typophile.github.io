  body: John, I don&#39;t think that script is a font. Notice how the two E&#39;s
    vary. Just to be sure, I did a search for &#34;script&#34; in MyFonts. Zip. There
    are things that are in the general ballpark, but nothing close to a match. Could
    be it&#39;s not on MyFonts, but I think it&#39;s more likely custom. In fact,
    I&#39;d guess that this EEz-In thing goes back decades as a trademark.
