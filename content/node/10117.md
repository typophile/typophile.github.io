  body: Jiawei, when you get an error message when posting here, it means its posted.
    Jus go to Topics and then to Critique and you will see your name as the most recent
    posting. It works, I promise.  <BR> <BR>How are you going to use your typeface
    design? If its going to be anything but display sizes or in print I&#39;m afraid
    the subtitle details will fill in and be lost. Try to always think of the end
    use of your designs.

  body: Jiawei, <BR> <BR>Would you consider this a bitmap or simply display? I moved
    the thread to DISPLAY, but if it is bitmap I&#39;ll move it again. <BR> <BR>The
    idea is interesting and a clever used of that detail. Are you working on the rest
    of the alphabet?

  body: Interesting.  <BR> <BR>I think the &#39;visual logic&#39; of the Chinese &#39;broken
    square line&#39; style, if I can call it that, requires some treatment of the
    ends of the strokes. For example, if you look at the bottom of the small side
    table you posted, they have squarish &#39;feet&#39; that break the straight line
    of the leg. <BR> <BR>The ends of the strokes here look &#39;naked&#39; to me,
    and call for something like the treatment of the feet of the table, to be consistent
    with the style.
