  line (for an interior design firm). I'm looking for two typefaces that would illustrate
  \"form\" (serif?) and \"function\" (sans?). They need to work well together (like
  Meta and Meta Serif) and have the Romanian diacritics. What say ye?\r\n\r\nOh, and
  thank you.\r\n"

    too subtle, should be easier to manage too. Something like Didot\u2013Frutiger,
    Bembo\u2013Helvetica (from the old faces), but find new ones?"

  body: Thanks, paragraph. Your point about contrast is interesting. The client likes
    sans a lot, especially geometric ones. Any ideas?
