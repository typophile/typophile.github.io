    mentioned it in some thread.\r\nI didn\u2019t find any evidence anywhere, though.\r\nBut

    it was still in private beta. I deleted the thread after realizing my error (with
    apologies to MyFonts).\r\n\r\nSomeone at TypeCon this last summer (can't remember
    who) told me that Underware did the new logo."
