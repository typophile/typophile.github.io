  body: "This is a strange genre, and hard to categorize for searches. I think it
    seems between Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts, which would make it late 19th -
    early 20th century. It looks hand-drawn. In the following suggestions, which are
    to me only suggestive of this font, you could either add small rounded serifs,
    or make the existing serifs smaller, to make these fonts resemble this sample
    more (sorry I am not linking this list): Eccentric, Clichee, Nevins Hand, Kolo,
    Berolina (Solo), Korinna and Stoclet. You could mix the round Kolo O's with stump-seriffed
    modification of Eccentric and get a rather similar look I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike
    Yanega\r\n\r\np.s. I would be curious to know what this really is, if anyone gets
    it."

  body: "Good job Mike!. That can be seen and downloaded at Dafont also. Odd design
    which uses lower case as narrow U.C. letters, while U.C. letters are normal width.\r\n\r\n-
