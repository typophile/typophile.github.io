    good base from which to recreate it:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/\r\n\r\nA

    get the swash on the n and i, steal from the leg of the capital R. You'll also
    have to edit the serifs on the U and v, and condense, skew, and scale everything."

  body: Well done, Riccardo. There's got to be Clarendon-style typeface out there
    with a full set of Greek glyphs. Maybe Fivos can locate one....

  body: "Finding Greek letters looks like a long shot.\r\nThe most efficient way to
    make the letters in the logo is to find a Clarendon that already has an Italic
    with the thin upkick tails and modify it. One such font is Patrick Griffin's Clarendon
    Text http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/ \r\nStarting from
    Clarendon Text Bold Italic, I condensed the letters to 70% and applied an extra
    slant of 4 degrees to compensate for the condensation. This is the result [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClarendonTextboldItalicW70pctXtraSlant4deg_5040.jpg]\r\nA
    good basis for whatever further modification you wish to apply to approach the
    letters in the original logo.\r\nDon"
