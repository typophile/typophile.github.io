body: "I just noticed that Fontlab has released another <a href=\"http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/20011\">revision
  of Fontographer</a>. This is undoubtedly good news, but can anyone from the company
  (Adam? Yuri?) list the changes and fixes between version 4.7.2 and 4.7.3? I have
  been unable to locate any release notes on the Fontlab site or in the user forums.\r\n\r\nInquiring
  minds want to know.\r\n\r\nAnd while you're digging around, I'd appreciate knowing
  what the differences between the version 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 releases are as well. \r\n\r\nThanks."

    we don't have a list of changes for the earlier minor updates handy. But mostly,
    these were bugfixes resulting from the porting of Fontographer 4.1 to Mac OS X
    -- no features added or principal functionality changes. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
