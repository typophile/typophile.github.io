<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi Typos -- soliciting feedback on the near final corporate identity set below. Thanks!
---Original--------
Hi,
Looking or feedback on which of these (ROUGH) layouts to develop. Letterhead and envelope are essentially done -- will post later. The card will have a tagline and graphic on the reverse side. Essentially working with the type blocks at this point. Haven't really locked things into a grid yet. Just playing with compositions. Will get into the fine details of type once decided.
Alternative concepts are welcome.

<div class=commentbody>That is a long e-mail address and just to accommodate that I think you will need to follow a landscape design so I would say go with 2a or b, whichever works best with your other stationery, though on these examples my preference is for 2b.

<div class=commentbody>i agree with tim and dan. go with the landscape format of 2a or 2b. personally, i prefer 2b. it follows a clean and simple hierarchy, and draws more attention to the "maui mountain cruisers". my eye naturally moves to the persons name/title next, and then on down to the contact info. keep the padding around the edges the same. your info is framed well.

<div class=commentbody>Gentlemen,
Thank you for the feedback. Your input confirms my eye's preference as well: 2B. I'll go ahead a work with the subtleties now. This is good news, as it may allow me to carry over a graphical concept that exists in the letterhead. Currently, the fine print and the line grid on the other pieces is at/based on 10.5pt. This is a bit big for the card so I'm going to change them to match the card's final type/grid -- probably 9 or 10pt.
Dan:
The logo which resulted from that old thread still lives at the website: http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/.
I comissioned our very own Aquatoad (Randy Jones) to implement a double stacked "M" and fine tune Leviathan to make it look more authentic. He's done a bang up job!
Timd:
I know! The email adress (long TLD) provided the biggest challenge with this layout.
Ben:
Yes, I really like how 2B leads the eye, and the simple, large negative spaces make for a more cohesive composition.
Will post some variations soon.
Thanks,
-t</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would choose 2B or 3A, but I guess 2B would fit in a roladex.
Anywho, The color on the business cards looks like a very brown color, not the vibrant orange on the website. When I think of Maui, I definately don't think brown. Maybe it's just the screen, but I would try to get it the orange from the website to match the Hawaiian islands' vibrancy.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi,
Okay, here's some variations on 2B: http://typophile.com/system/files?file=mmc2.gif
Increased name from 10.5pt to 11pt. Everyting else is 9pt, except phone fax labels at 7pt. Flopped the phone/fax numbers and labels (now also all lowercase). Made first letter of email address uppercase. Logotype is roughly based on 18pt x-height.
2B1/2B1_UC are based on 9/11.1 line grid -- Providing 13 horizontal lines over the 2-inch height.
2B2/2B2_UC are based on 9/13.1 line grid -- Providing 11 horizontal lines over the 2-inch height.
I have lined everything up fairly rigidly, except for right margin. This may be too slavish, e.g., the bottom margin on the 2B1s is too small yes?
What are your thoughts on the leading, especially as regards to the bottom text block? Is 9/13.1 too much? Also looking for feedback on uppercase vs title case for the... title, i.e., "President."
Realize margins might need some fine tuning. Any other input is most welcome.

<div class=commentbody>Dan:
Do you think a nudge or two or take it (name/title) down a full h-line? I might try both.
As regards to the 1/8" safety, how do you deal with this? Is this the standard deviation for printers trimming from parent sheets? Does that mean I should pull all elements an 1/8" (or at least a 1/16" in from the 'ideal.' It seems like a lot of distance in such a small area.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Typos,
Here's a near final comp of the card. Wanted to get some last eyes on this before it goes to client. Will post letterhead and envelope once I have my swatch books. I still haven't chosen final color/s. Plan is it for to be two-color, or one- if possible.
The concept for the back of the card is that of a tire tread. I'd like to deboss the tread pattern and have it be slightly darker than the ground to give the impression of (err...) an imprint. Any thoughts on how to best execute this would be MUCH appreciated, i.e., color, how deep, etc.?
What about the cruiserguy pattern? I tried varous sizes and stroke widths. To my eye, 5-high was too busy/small.
What are your thoughts on the upper vs lowercase title on the card's front? I just can't decide on this; I like them both. Are the margins sufficient for a safe trim?
Input on typography, composition, and color are all welcome.

<div class=commentbody>Jeffrey,
inre the cruiseguy pattern, it is integral to the corporate identity set, so i need to work it in some how. i think if it's screened light enough it might work. Randy (Aquatoad) suggested trying to tighten up the pattern so it locks up better. I'll play with your idea about tracks on the front -- and maybe crusierguys(s) on the back ala the header on the website?
> I really like that logo!
Yeah, everyone's very happy with it. There's a old thread around here somewhere chronicling its evolution. It would not have been possible were it not for Typophile, and the excellent work of Randy Jones (Aquatoad) who contributed greatly to the design.</div>

Yes, hard to show on screen, but screened very light it wouldn't look as busy.
<em>But</em> if that guy is part of the identity, I think putting it on the back as bodly as you have the tracks on the card-back example would be nice too.
I know what you mean about the help here. Amazing and refreshing to see talent that actually has time to give such nice guidance.</div>

Here's the whole set soon to go to client for approval. I'm still working out the specifics of the overprints and color. Going two color: Pantone Uncoated 167 and 468.
I'd love to get some feedback before delivery. Especially as regards to typography and composition.

Are you referring to the tagline, i.e., "10,000 feet..." or the bicycle guy graphic? The postal standard, to my knowledge, is that the "Barcode Clear Zone" is the <em>right</em> 4-3/4" and the bottom 5/8." I figure the graphic will be okay since it's essentially going to be a watermark.

<div class=commentbody>I'm really liking everything about this - especially how it's rich but subdued, controlled. Great job. The one thing I might gripe about is that that biker guy looks too symmetrical; I'd make him a bit more... frantic.
BTW, are those traps inside the "N"s in the logo?
If so, I think I'd get rid of them.

<div class=commentbody>Tim my only comments are: The tire tracks aren't like any mountain bike I've ever owned or used. Take one of their bikes with a little water on the tread and roll it over some paper and scan that. The tracks look like a Jeep.
You also have a very expensive business card in that its full bleed on both sides. Is it necessary? The letterhead also is a bleed 3 sides. I suggest using that letterhead for promotions only and make most of the letterhead without the mountain graphic for general corespondence. Remember part of your job as a designer is watching out for your clients budgets. Once I had my personal letterhead with a bleed on three sides, but the reason it didn't cost much was I used Standard letterhead paper (8 1/2" x 11") and had it trimmed to Monarch size (7 1/4" x 10 1/2").
Its a bit late, but isn't the concept of this type of adventure, to do it as a group experience? If it is why show one bike rider, shouldn't it be a group of riders?
Overall its nice work. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Letterhead: Can you move the biker to the left? A little more assymetrical. Can you center the logo over the vanishing point? I see the you'll also need to move the addresses to the left to keep alignment.
Envelope: I wish the biker were interacting with the other information a little more. It seems to be distracting. If it interacted it would become a true secondary element.
Card: I'm boring, Tim. I would prefer the card to be horizontal on both sides. It is a pet peeve of mine. Just me. Nothing personal. However, Do you need the biker and the tracks on the back? This doesn't happen anywhere else. Biker change to percentage of tracks and remove tracks. I like the tracks on the front. I think you've worked the type to near perfection for what you have to work with. I'd only suggest, perhaps, letterspacing a hair the title.
Overall: I really like these colors. Reminds me of Moab. I do wish you had the track on the envelope or letterhead, but I understand about costs. Great job!
BTW Great to hear you used Randy. Looks like he did what needed doing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Typos,
Thaks for all the great suggestions!
Hrant:
I like your idea of mashing up the biker guy to make him look more "frantic." I suppose when your leaning into a turn on a bike, you are anything but symmetrical.
Dan:
Brilliant idea about the tread pattern. I may actually have a photo of the tread around here somewhere. The crusier bikes have a strange tread pattern. I had actually built this pattern out of the form of the "A" in the logotype -- which is also used as 'arrows' elsewhere in the set. I didn't want it to be too literal, but it might sell better if it was the actually tread. Not sure I have time for this unless I can find that photo.
As regards to costs and bleeds. The printing is going to fall well under budget due to the fact that I procured parent size sheets (Speckletone - Madero Beach) directly from French and because it's a 2-Color job.
As far as "group experience" goes -- one could go either way on that. Some go as groups others as couples, and solo. The tour does ride as a group, but many people refer to it as an individual experience with the incredible environment.
Tiffany:
Moving biker left may work nicely. I'll play.
You said "vanishing point," am I to assume that you processed a road into the horizon as a opposed to a mountain?
Not sure how to get biker guy to interact more on the envelope. Not a lot of options here as far as I can tell. Ideas?
Card: I had the biker only on the back, but it just seemed a bit boring. The tracks kind of tied it all together in a subdued sort of way. I like the size of the biker -- any bigger and it's not recognizable -- smaller and it's not prominent enough.
As per <a href=http://www.ms-studio.com/>Mark S's</a> (and your) suggestion -- all the 9pt text could probably use a bit of tracking.
Color: yes the Moab like colors work well. In fact Maui's "red dirt" is a very similar color due to it's high iron content.
<a href=http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/inc/img/mars_lrg.jpg>A Photo of Haleakala Crater</a> -- only slightly digitally exagerated.
Mahalo to everyone for your expert input. I'll have one last go around, but may not be able to post again until after approval.
Aloha,
