  body: I really like it too. Only thing, you might consider repositioning/resizing
    the words "At Stalisfield Green", it doesn't feel quite right to me yet. But "The
    Plough" is beautiful - very distinct and appropriate.

    work together in a more interesting manner.

    did I actually say that?)\r\n\r\nSounds like the sort of place I'd put on our
    list of \"pubs to visit the next time we're over\" list.\r\n\r\n(Of course, that's
    assuming they've got real beer and non-\"fashion-victim\" food: give me well-crafted

  body: I might try loosening up the text in the second take, Clarendon can kinda
    run into itself on occasion, especially the "At Stalisfield Green" section.

  body: "Thanks for the comments and suggestions everyone.\r\n\r\nOver 130 reads but
    only 7 comments? I hope that means it's genereally OK. I guess more people would
    respond if there was something drastically or obviously wrong with it. Or maybe
    i'm just not very popular round here :)\r\n\r\nIf the client gives positive feedback
    i will refine it further and try to improve the compositon regarding the \"At
    Stalisfield Green\" line. I will probably modify some of the terminals? and serifs
    to reduce that \"Harry Potter\" vibe too.\r\n\r\nLinda - The 2 images aren't so
    much alternates, but more to show the client how either the traditional or trendy
    (blurgh!) qualities of the logo/pub could be accentuated when required. You can
    put the pub on your list as I have been assured both the beer and the food is
    real thing :)\r\n\r\nTim -  I'm sort of glad you picked up on the claw-like and
    wrought iron qualities because i wanted the logotype to work as a bit of a visual
    metaphor for an actual old iron plough. But i can see what you're saying. It was
    a concern of mine too. Unfortunately any gothic script/blackletter styling risks
    evoking horror film connotations. I'd hoped to go back to it's roots and not the
    70's Hammer films. It's a very fine line, which i may have crossed :(\r\n\r\nTim
    -  Thanks for your suggested alternatives, but i think Wexford Oakley has overtones
    even more worrying than horror films and is just plain ugly. If the client has
    the same concerns as you about what i've done then i may consider the Sparrowhawk
    route. With some modification it could work well. Ta for that one.\r\n"

  body: "Funny, other people have said it's ugly, I don't see it that way, rather
    as an attractive modernisation of Old English, I'll just have to accept that it's
    like Marmite (either that or my taste is completely wrong) :)\r\nMaybe you could
    try just developing the plough motif from one character, P or g perhaps. Either
    way I think you need to look at the stresses in the rounded characters, they seem
    too symmetrical at the moment.\r\nTim"

    aren't quite right on all the rounded characters, but i'm confused (and more than
    a little ignorant about such things) when you say they seem too symmetrical. I
    thought stresses were symmetrical within a character but can vary in angle through
    a font. Or is that too simplistic?\r\n\r\nI admit i took the easy option of using
    the 'o' with bits added or removed to build the other rounded letters. It was
    intentional though, in the hope of limiting the gothic vibe a little.\r\n\r\nI'm
    happy with vertical stress on the o, but certainly the u and h and maybe the g
    and e could be improved.\r\n"

    to me, and the descenders too much like fangs. I think a pub is a warm inviting
    place, this looks a bit scary.
