		<div class="commentbody">Forty years ago, when I was younger (especially just after graduate school when I was full of philosophical notions), I frequently applied mathmatical structure to my work.  It was very rewarding to me as a person.  I was attempting to resolve the &quot;unified fields&quot; theory in design and typography.  My clients were, perhaps rightfully, merely concerned with their communication issues and were at best tolerant of my structuralist escapades. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I discovered was that the human eye and the mind behind it a far better at finding inherant structural solutions than books full of mathmatical expressions.  I have now completely abandoned forced application of known-to-be-sound ratios.  I trust my eyes to know what is best.  Type design is a prime example.  There is so much optical correction in defining a font that you find yourself fudging anyway.  Imagine the great type designers of centuries past cutting punches by hand.  They had nothingcapable of measuring precisely enough so they just used their eyes and their talent.  After the fact, critics write books analizing their fonts and ascribing great mathematical logic to the forms they created.  Who knows what Claude Garamond used or how he really designed his type.  I would bet that it is more hand and eye than anything else. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This week I began work on a new typeface (it has been a few years since the last one). This time I decided to abandon all measurement, all rules, all comparison to existing faces, all &quot;school knowlege&quot; and just let my human faculties determine everything.  This is not an &quot;Arty&quot; face or even a Humanistic face.  It is a pretty straight forward workhorse sans serif that I intend to have broad usability</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The cool mathematical stuff can work pretty well. But the combination of the eye and logic is the best. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris is particularly right about the differences between pure math and optically correct design when it comes to type design. I found it very instructional to look at reproductions of Paul Renner's original drawings for Futura and compare them to what Bauer issues. Renner's original design was based on pure geometry, and would have been an absolute failure as a typeface. The Bauer design staff corrected and fixed Renner's design to make it actually work as a typeface. If his original drawings had been cut as type, Futura would have been a complete failure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

Composers worked for centuries to evolve the formal rules of counterpoint and sonata style only for later composers to break from these rules to create music which has a structure based on &quot;unstructure&quot;.
