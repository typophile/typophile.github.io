    <BR> <BR>If not, take the best samples of your packing, or exact measurements
    with <i>crease and angle measurements</i> to a die cutter. You will need, if you
    don&#39;t have them, <i>tympan, make ready</i> and <i>under sheets.</i> Complexity
    is in the same order. <BR> <BR>You can make them up on your own. The paper is
    generally sold in rolls. The rolls are expensive. <i>Close to the core</i> makes
    inferior packing. The results, unless you are professional, will predictably cause
    difficulty in giving equal <i>Drum Tone.</i> <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange, or Jim Rimmer
    may have other suggestions. <BR>

    items, in Vandercook-speak, would be top blankets &#40;drawsheets&#41;, under
    blankets, undersheets &#40;.006 manila&#41;. NAG has a catalog. Basically a mylar
    top blanket and Kimlon under blanket &#40;about $50&#41; will do you, along with
    the undersheets. These are all cut to fit your press, which had a long production
    life, so there are still lots of parts, etc. On a Vandercook, various thicknesses
    of professional grade tracing paper will work nicely for minor makeready &#40;actually
    taped directly to the tympan - Vandercooks aren&#39;t exactly production presses
    and aren&#39;t all that fussy&#41;. NAG also has a lithographer&#39;s sheet, called
    generically, non-slip paper, in various thicknesses. Works well as makeready and/or
    as an undersheet. <BR> <BR>No real outlet for any of this stuff in LA anymore.

  body: Johnathan <BR> <BR>On top of the other advice you have received from G and
    G, I use old litho plates as bottom packing. This is cheaper than using up you
    oiled packing paper, and makes for clean impression, and is easy on your type.
    <BR> <BR>I have made a cardstock template of the tympan for my press, and cut
    pieces to this size and shape from a fat roll of oiled packing paper. <BR> <BR>Jim
