  body: Boy, it seems awfully familiar, but the best I&#39;ve been able to come up
    with so far is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/acadian/">Acadian</a>.
    Maybe it&#39;s a free Corel font?

    It&#39;s an old metal face, so it&#39;s likely there are other versions of this
    around.

  body: Harrington was released by Microsoft once in TT for Mac. The font is also
    sold as <a href="http://www.precisiontype.com/fontsearchres.asp?n=0&amp;tf=0&amp;s=1&amp;results=25"
    target="_blank">Hermosa</a> by Richard Beatty Design. Precision Type sells it
    in all formats except OTF. <BR> <BR>&#40;I know this is a late post, but I was
    gone until yesterday, and Script fonts get my notice.&#41;
