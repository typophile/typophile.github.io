  been interested in design for several years, I'm much more of a developer than designer
  but after watching a documentary about Gutenberg I've been bitten by the typography
  bug.\r\n\r\nAs I'm still very much in the early stages of learning about type I'd
  be interested in any recommendations for books or other resources I should investigate.
  I have just finished reading Robin Williams Non-designers design and type books
  which inspired me to create a design cheatsheet (using the techniques from the book)
  that I could have to hand to remind me of the main principles and ideas.\r\n\r\nI
  have attached it to this post and I would really appreciate any feedback or criticism
  you may have on the overall design and the typefaces I chose along with any tips
  you have for improvement."

    is all about rules, but also about breaking them, on several levels. It seems
    that you have observed the rules in reading but I think that you need to concentrate
    very hard on how to design this information in order that it doesn't contradict
    itself! It's quite a complex task to illustrate so many ideas without the design
    becoming cluttered.\r\n\r\nOne rule that a lot of typographers/designers observe
    is to avoid using too many typefaces/colours, try and combine that rule with your
    design and you may find it helps clarity.\r\n\r\nYou could expand the cheat sheet
    into several small posters or pages of a booklet to focus on the main points,
    white space for example. Maybe then you could get away with more typefaces. One
    per poster perhaps, or one typeface on all posters and one that changes to illustrate
    some of your points!\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn though (at least for me) is
    not to focus too much on the rules, which become apparent as you design and discover
    what works and what doesn't.\r\n\r\nHope I don't sound preachy :-) Feel free to
    throw it all back at me!\r\n\r\nAndy"

  body: "Hi Andy,\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to look and replying. I kind of
    know that I'm using a few too many typefaces but I was really struggling to put
    all the points I wanted to cover together on one page in a more interesting way
    than having it all in a typical bullet list style. I also know that I've broken
    some of the rules. It was intentional but I'm not sure it comes across appropriately.\r\n\r\nI
    like the top half of the page and feel that works quite well, but then I think
    it goes downhill somewhat after that and I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to approach
    making it better...\r\n\r\nAndy (I'm also an Andy :))"
