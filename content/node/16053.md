    will have to look up the face to confirm.

  body: "Although InDesign optical kerning isn't perfect, it can't be responsible
    for this one (even with negative tracking added). This is clearly hand-kerned
    to get that consistently almost-touching look. Feels like something done in late
    60s or the 70s.\r\n\r\nThe two letters \"u\" in Portuguese look like they are
    randomly raised just a bit for no good reason.\r\n\r\nT"

    quiz is a little harder since one has to find a typeset anomaly that's not overly

  body: "I remember seeing that same Baskerville g with Bembo many years ago on a
    poster or something. I'm not sure, but I think I may also have even seen it in
    a type sample book. I think there was a dodgy off-brand film font of Bembo going
    around back in the seventies.\r\n\r\nIf you look up Bembo in the Solotype catalog,
    you can see the same hiccoughing u's in it. Too bad it doesn't show the g. It
    may have been in one of the other Dover type books. Anybody have the \"Classic
    Roman Alphabets\" volume? I don't have that one handy and I'm pretty sure it's
    in there."

  body: My guess is that the film font contained the mistake. How it got there is
    a mystery, but one possible explanation is that it was put there deliberately
    by a reputable film font maker to sniff out pirates, in other words, type houses
    (or employees of type houses) who were copying and reselling the fonts. (Phil
    Martin confirmed the existence of this practice when I interviewed him for Typographica.)
    You see this occasionally in old film font catalogs. I remember noticing quite
    a few in the notorious Type Films of Chicago catalog we had at a magazine I worked
    for around 1980. I believe some of these "mistakes" have even made it into digital
    fonts by people who are making fonts by scanning specimens from old film font
    catalogs.

  body: "Mark, that not only sounds plausible, but probably the most feasible of reasons.
    \r\n\r\nSo what does that say about type revivals in general?\r\n\r\nAnd for most
    graphic designers who may want to \"faithfully\" produce a piece in period style
    of Bembo, and believes \"faithfully\" in Monotype (or Linotype) to provide a \"faithful\"
    version of Bembo, only to find that Monotype decided to release an even more \"faithful\"
    version of the cut in Bembo Book.\r\nThen we BASH graphic designers for not understanding
    typography.  :-(\r\n"

    does it. \r\n\r\nGraphic designers live in a different world from typographers
    and type designers. Some of us live in both worlds. It's sort of like being one
    of those guys who has more than one family, neither of which knows about the other.
    (My graphic design family has called the missing persons bureau, though.)"
