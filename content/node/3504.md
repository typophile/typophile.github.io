  to make a typeface by blocks. But not too oblique as a square pixelfont, just a
  little bit more &#34;curved&#34; &#40;you read sexy <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: ' Per, <BR> <BR>The glyphs I found myself liking the most were the dingbats.
    I don&#39;t think anyone has done &#34;kitchen-tile&#34; dingbats before; that
    might be a good direction. <BR> <BR>As far as the font itself goes, I think I&#39;ve
    seen so many grid-based typefaces &#40;and created more than my share!&#41; that
    it didn&#39;t turn my crank so much. My favorite non-dingbat glyph was the zero,
    and if you could do a whole character set utilizing those spiked forms, that would
    be pretty neat. '
