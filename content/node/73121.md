  owner of this sports car.  \r\n\r\nLost the decal on one side but no one has one
  for sale.  Local print shop says if I can identify the font they can print a new
  decal for me.  Car manufactured by Diamond Motors (Mitsubishi) in Normal, Illinois
  1989.  Also sold as Laser and Eclipse.  This font was used in consumer print sales
  and promotional materials as well as on the car itself."

  body: "This looks to be very similar to Mark's Changeling Neo Bold, which is based
    on his earlier Changeling family (which was based on China, a mid-70s typeface
    from VGC). The 1 and A characters are different, however, but could be customised
    in Illustrator or Photoshop (or, indeed, the GIMP, which is free). See if your
    print shop will deal with TIFF images, or EPS files if you have Illustrator -
    if they say yes you can have a go at customising it yourself.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/changeling-neo/bold/\r\n\r\n-NJ"
