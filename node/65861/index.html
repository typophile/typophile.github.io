  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Inspired by a cool new character invented by Nina*, I&rsquo;ve started thinking: maybe we can design/use symbols beyond the asterisk and dagger(s) to annotate text? Sure people use numbers, but that&rsquo;s pretty boring isn&rsquo;t it? Plus numbers are easily confusable when they&rsquo;re small. And having two floating digits is ugly (and the reason people use a dagger instead of two asterisks). So the Challenge is to make new symbols that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly convey that they&rsquo;re for annotation.</li>
<li>Look good small and floating.</li>
<li>Are not confusable with other annotation symbols.</li>
</ul>

<p>I actually use custom little floating reference thingies* when I handwrite an article for splicing in additional text, but had never thought of putting things like that into fonts.</p>
<ul>
<li>BTW, is &ldquo;annotations&rdquo; a good name for these?</li>
</ul>

<p><cite>&ldquo;I actually use custom little floating reference thingies* when I handwrite an article for splicing in additional text&rdquo;</cite>
Me too.</p>
<p>One interesting feature of these symbols vis-à-vis numbers or alphabetics is obviously that they&rsquo;re not inherently sequential. So while numbers seem more practical in situations where you have lots of annotations/footnotes/etc., I would imagine that in more literary texts, and/or ones that use fewer notes (and no endnotes that are all lumped together!), a more graphical solution would certainly be a very nice option.</p>
<p>One question is if a bit of intuitively «readable» «sequentialness» would still be desirable for annotation symbols, for example by means of repeating elements that could increase in number (lines, points…), or elements that get larger etc. But the fewer annotations you need (and the more easily the bits they refer to can be found), the less that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>So, do we make this into a Type Battle of sorts? :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Actually, I was thinking along similar lines, prompted by the same thread.
But I was too lazy and too slow a typer to start a new thread (and also not sure of the possible interest, but on this I was mistaken, it seems :-).
Anyway, some random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typesetting text, I often need some sort of reference symbol which is distinct from the figures used for endnotes/footnotes.</li>
<li>Usually I use the asterisk, which is fine for one, not so good for two (**), simply unacceptable for three (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, a censored swearword?&quot;).</li>
<li>The dagger, especially in sans serif typefaces, could be (conf)used to indicate a cross, meaning the (date of) death of a person (making especially unsuitable its use in conjunction with proper names).</li>
<li>I often end up using (oh, the horror!) the readily available degree sign (°).</li>
<li>If designers would want to insert these newly devised glyphs in their fonts, which codepoints should they use?</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I think the sketch I made in the other thread has potential.
<img src="/images/old-images/dagger_5860.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not sure if I will call it Daggerism (loaning from asterism) or Daggerisk, following Altaira&rsquo;s suggestion ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Of course John – like I said up there, I think numbers are unbeatable in contexts where you need many «annotation symbols» that are also undoubtedly sequential. But there are other situations too, like maybe less formal ones, more literary/poetic ones, quainter ones etc., where numbers would feel out of place, and where you don&rsquo;t need «ordering» as much (for example because you only need very few notes). And things like the heart and dagger hint at some nice possibilities of playing with semantics too!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For those who are not aware, there used to be a widely accepted convention for annotation symbols prescribed by <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> (when there are few notes, or in addition to numerical note references).</p>
<p>The generally accepted sequence (in U.S. publishing, anyway) was/is: 
* (asterisk), † (dagger), ‡ (double dagger), § (section mark), ∥ (parallels), # (number sign). When more symbols are required, the suggestion was to use doubles (e.g. ** †† ‡‡ etc.). These were often superscripted.</p>
<p>[Interestingly, the latest edition drops the mention of parallels and number sign &ndash; presumably because the parallels are not commonly available in digital fonts and because this sort of annotation has fallen out of favor.)</p>

<p>Yes, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if there were both? I get annoyed with scholarly works, where 90% of the notes are reference information, while the other 10% provide additional background information that I find useful. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if the background information could be done with footnotes at the base of the page, easily accessible, and the reference information placed in endnotes where the scholars who need it could access it there.</p>
<p>I have seen this system used once (I can&rsquo;t remember where) and think it would be a great addition to scholarly style.</p>

<p>Kent, so I take it this sequence isn&rsquo;t very much in use (and hence generally known) in the US now? FWIW, it is in any case culturally/regionally specific. For German, Forssmann / de Jong&rsquo;s &ldquo;Detailtypografie&rdquo; (which is a bit of a typesetting &ldquo;bible&rdquo;) refers to a slightly different &ldquo;traditional sequence&rdquo; – asterisk; 2 asterisks*; dagger; double dagger; section sign; pilcrow; parallels – but adds this is only one possibility. For up to 3 notes they simply recommend asterisks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only used if more than 6 symbols total needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure such fading conventions should have to be reasons to stop wondering about new/better characters. Like you say, this style of annotation isn&rsquo;t very popular nowadays (I wonder why?), maybe new symbols could be a cool way to breathe fresh life into the idea.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;ve seen the notes split between footnotes and endnotes, it is typically the other way round.

<p>Agreed. Most of the scholarly books I&rsquo;ve seen recently insert citations in the text, use the bottom of the page for critical apparatus, and end notes for explanatory notes or commentary.</p>
<p>Critical apparatus quite often involves a lot of different reference points on a single page, so numbers are the obvious choice. Which leaves the problem of how to reference explanatory end notes. My idea &ndash; which I doubt is original &ndash; is to use marginal reference numbers.</p>

<p>Yes, here&rsquo;s why. Citations this way are clearly citations, and being in parentheses can be skipped by the eye. When you have everything in foot or end notes, you don&rsquo;t know whether they are explanatory or simply citations, so you annoyingly have to go hunting to see whether it&rsquo;s something significant to your interests.</p>
<p>Where explanatory notes go should depend on the work, and the author&rsquo;s notion of their function, which he or she should be clear about. Then it may make sense to have them as end notes, side notes, or footnotes.</p>
<p>I think the separation of citations and explanatory notes has been a real advance in layout of scholarly works.</p>
<p>You could also do citations as numbered end notes, and explanations as side or foot notes. The most important thing I think is the separation of the two, whatever device you use.</p>

<p>Not really all that easy to skip&rsquo;em though. You have to spot the opening parenthesis, then decide it&rsquo;s a citation and not a parenthesized statement that you&rsquo;re actually supposed to read inline with the text*, and then find the closing parenthesis. Seems to make for a lot of stop-and-go while reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>To help this distinction I&rsquo;ve previously used all small caps with small caps parentheses for the citations – makes the skippin' a little easier, but they still seem to stand in the way of smooth text flow.</li>

<p><cite>&ldquo;When you have foot or end notes, you don’t know whether they are explanatory or simply citations, so you annoyingly have to go hunting to see whether it’s something significant to your interests.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>Which is exactly why it&rsquo;d be cool to have distinctive markers for the two. That&rsquo;s smart typography if you ask me (and not really that hard to &ldquo;learn&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Kent, I propose taking the system you show above and limiting each star to one of three symbols: 3, 4 and 5* spokes. With two symbols per mark you have 3^2 = 9 choices, which seems pretty decent.</p>
<ul>
<li>A 6 might be too hard to quickly tell apart from the 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it would progress something like this:</p>
<p>3
3</p>
<p>3
4</p>
<p>3
5</p>
<p>4
3</p>
<p>4
4</p>
<p>4
5</p>
<p>5
3</p>
<p>5
4</p>
<p>5
5</p>
<p>However I would propose that a given page not go sequentially through that list, but instead exclude parts as needed. For example a page could exclude one of the three symbols if it only happens to need 4 annotations; a page that only needs three could get by with one symbol per mark; etc.</p>

<p>Yes it is, compared to having to go hunting at the back of the book to see whether or not you want to read the note.</p>
<p>Ideally, you keep the form of the citation short, so you do see the opening and closing parens and the number, clearly signaling a citation. I agree that it can help to use small caps too. Practically every scholarly journal I have seen for the past 40 years uses this format for citations, and most books. What can you suggest that&rsquo;s better?</p>
<p>The book I am finishing writing is littered with references to Bible and Talmud, and I&rsquo;m doing all citations in small cap abbreviations, followed by chapter and verse, or Talmudic page. So these are in parens, the span of seven or eight characters. And there are no foot notes, end notes or side notes, though there are introductory notes and appendices.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not stuck on the reference-in-parens style, but I am totally convinced that if you have a lot of citations, they shouldn&rsquo;t be mixed with explanatory notes.</p>
<p>I think this is a matter of trying to make it easy and efficient for the reader to navigate, and both author and designer should be thinking about how to do that.</p>

<p>Oh sorry, I didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>The advantage of the in line version is a. you have it and you&rsquo;re done, and it&rsquo;s easily skippable; b. it is space saving: if you have citations at the end, you can have a citation each line, so you eat up pages, or you have to reset with columns.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a separate problem with foot notes, which is that they are usually very ugly and distracting, compared to side or end notes. I think they should be used very sparingly, if at all, and there shouldn&rsquo;t be more than two per page. Otherwise it gets <em>really</em> ugly.</p>
<p>I like all the little dingbats, but I just don&rsquo;t see the need for more than a few foot notes, ever.</p>
<p>I can see the use of the little dingbats if you have a list of members of an organization and want to distinguish various statuses, such as founder, member of the board, eastern division, etc, something like that might be useful.</p>

<p>To me parenthesized stuff is uglier.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Aesthetically, I don&rsquo;t really like the inline citations, especially not when there are a lot of them on the page. Functionally, though, I do think they are the best approach, not least because they make it immediately apparent to the reader where a particular idea is coming from. In books with citations in footnotes or endnotes, I only occasionally bothered to look up citations; I am aware, with the inline citations, of a greater contextuality to my reading. That seems to me a functional editorial benefit, even if typographically I don&rsquo;t like the look of it much.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, I agree with you that inline citations are a problem aesthetically. But to me superscript numbers or symbols are also even more distracting and disruptive. Because of their position to me they are like little alarm bells that tell you that you need to stop and look something up.</p>
<p>The cleanest method is where everything is in end notes with no superscript characters in the text. In this method, you have a running head above the end notes indicating which pages the notes relate to. Then before the note itself you have the page number and the phrase which has the associated citation or commentary.</p>
<p>Which approach is best I think depends on the nature of the text. For example, if you have a scholarly history that discusses various other historian&rsquo;s views, then in line citations I think would be appropriate. If you have a narrative history that goes for aesthetically pleasing story telling, then shoving all citations to the end, and keeping the text completely clean would be best.</p>
<p>Footnotes are the worst, because yes, Hrant, it is very disruptive on page after page to look down the page, and then have to go back and hunt down where you were in the text. And I don&rsquo;t think my aesthetic objection is a matter of &lsquo;modernism&rsquo;; I&rsquo;m not a modernist. It&rsquo;s just ugly.</p>

<p>Super clean yes; but while you&rsquo;re reading the text, you have to guess which section might have a note in the back! Or are you supposed to first read the text, then read all the notes, and then find and re-read the sections of the text that have notes? 
I&rsquo;ve seen/read such systems a few times, and hated it every time. To me that&rsquo;s a pretty good example of prettiness/«clean-ness» that comes at the expense of usability. I think this can only work (if at all; I&rsquo;ve personally never seen it work) in a very narrow range of text genres; for example in scientific texts it might actually be problematic editorially, because in the case of citations/sources, it doesn&rsquo;t make it immediately clear that a given section comes from a different source. That little «alarm bell» isn&rsquo;t just noise; it can also help mark things that aren&rsquo;t to be misread as self-contained truths. Kinda like that asterisk on shop signs that say «50% OFF ON EVERYTHING*».</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nina, as far as visual aesthetics, I think the only thing that is really problematic are foot notes. You can also mess up side notes visually, but if carefully done in an appropriate layout they can work.</p>
<p>The issue of in-line citations VS end notes with superior figures in the text VS end notes with no superior figures to me is mainly an issue of comfort and ease of use for the reader.</p>
<p>On the question of comfort and ease of use in the system with no superior figures, my experience is not the same as yours. I find it obvious when a quotation or factual claim calls for a citation, and if I want it, I&rsquo;ll go look at the end of a book.  I&rsquo;m grateful that there&rsquo;s nothing distracting me from the text and pushing me to look it up. As to explanatory notes, I&rsquo;ll just look at all the end notes before or after I read the text, and see if there is anything I find interesting.</p>
<p>My impression is that the cleanest method is becoming more and more popular, though it is more work in producing the book.</p>
<p>By the way, with electronic texts, you have a lot more options because of the possibility of hypertext links. That&rsquo;s an advantage of electronic texts, along with search-ability.</p>

<p>I would think so. Consider: our vision is aligned to horizontal movement, so glancing out to the margin and back in to the text on a horizontal plane, or close to a horizontal plane, is a faster process than looking down to the bottom of the page and back up again. Good marginal notes align to the text to which they refer, and hence can often be implemented without any inline indicators. So they may be both less disruptive to reading and less disruptive to the appearance of the text.</p>

<p>I have to concede that point.
But I worry that inline stuff is just too hard to ignore if you want to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>glancing out to the margin and back &hellip;. is a faster process</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good point, I just worry that the temptation to look at the margin note* before its time is too great. As for the aesthetic argument, I think can go either way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly because our eyes prefer the horizontal; plus it stands out in the empty margin.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Maybe my own reading habits are simply too inquisitive.</p>
<p>BTW, this is exactly the sort of thing that could be tested quite well empirically (unlike reading performance, which is a huge challenge).</p>
