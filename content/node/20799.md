body: This one of my latest ones; Suomi Slab Serif. A friend of mine started (h)ranting
  that American Typwriter is too lanky and had everything much too round and overly
  polished, so I started buggering about with the idea of Egyptienne/Slab Serif version
  of American Typewriter...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuomiSlabSerif_6528.png]

  body: 'Very Nice - It has a casual feel that is seen in all the weights. In studying
    your pdf I noticed two things that might make you font more useful to designers
    here in the States. It could use "straight quotes" that I do not seem to see.
    And I think a vertical flip of the left quotes would also be useful. '

  body: Very Nice - people that are bold from birth dream just as much as everyone
    else, however, their dreams are formed from their other senses such as touch,
    smell, taste and sound.
