  body: How hard would it to make square dots instead of round dots. There are exactly

  body: I was actually wondering if there was a cut of Futura that had square dots
    as it increased in weight or whether it is not Futura but something based very

  body: What bugs me is that the x-height looks a tad too big. <BR>Could it be Monotype&#39;s
    Futura rip-off <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205387"
    target="_blank"> 20th Century</a>? <BR> <BR>This still doesn&#39;t explain the
    square dots, but let&#39;s  <BR>consider those customized.
