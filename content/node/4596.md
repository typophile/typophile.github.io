  <i>The Frogs</i> and <i>The Birds</i>. The former is set Fleischmann with a great
  all caps display type. The following is based on &#40;not exactly&#41; those letters.

    <BR> <BR>Hrant, I&#39;ve made a note to remind you about the Fleischmann specimen.
    I can&#39;t believe you can get an Enschede specimen from a library--the bookstores
    here &#40;Mississippi&#41; don&#39;t know what a type specimen is... but we have
    the blues. Anyway... <BR> <BR>I need to get that Carter book, I&#39;d like to
    see the V&amp;A font as well. <BR> <BR>Eduardo, the spacing was done in the layout
    &#40;actually slapped together&#41; so it doesn&#39;t really reflect the sidebearings.
    The sidebearings really haven&#39;t been set yet--I still haven&#39;t finished
    all the letters. So maybe the spacing would solve the problem &#40;or help&#41;?

  body: About the width of capitals, I believe that for a titling face there is often
    more variation in width than in caps made with an eye to lower case. Personally,
    I think it is more elegant to have not uniformity in wide or narrow, but the variation,
    such as in Forum caps or Zapf&#39;s Michelangelo titling face.  <BR> <BR>I suspect
    that small caps may often work better for titling because they are designed and
    spaced for all caps setting, as opposed to regular caps, which are done with an
    eye to the harmony with the lower case. I am just guessing, and I&#39;d be interested
    in hearing from those knowledgeable about this.   <BR> <BR>Jonathan Hoefler discusses

  body: 'JF, thanks once more. Your method seems pretty optimal. <BR> <BR>&#62; I
    think it is more elegant to have not uniformity <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also better
    for reading. <BR> <BR>The one interesting thing I&#39;ve discovered about caps
    is that you have to let them be their own alphabet &#40;for better or worse&#41;:
    you simply can&#39;t make them harmonize with the lc too much &#40;unless it&#39;s
    a funky font&#41;. This is an anti-Modernism realization. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Thanks, JFP, for your correction and clarification. I have been using Minion
    SC for subtitles in a project I am working on, and found it worked better than
    the caps, but that is not actually a title, and there probably the smoothness
    of the small caps setting helps. I will look at this and check where I am using
    caps vs small caps with a better awarenes of the difference. <BR> <BR>But I guess
    for Addison, who wants to work on an all-caps titling face the point holds: he
    would best be guided by looking at other titling faces, or compare those faces
    which have both regular and titling caps. '

  body: Yes, written English. <BR>The main difference between written and spoken English
    is &#34;you&#34;, which occurs much more in the latter. So Addison, if you think
    your all-caps font might be used for setting a lot of yelling dialogue, adding
    &#34;YO&#34; to that list might be useful.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, I also have
    a list of trigraphs. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    does have a reference to my source for trigaphs though: &#34;Secret and Urgent&#34;
    by Pratt, 1939. It&#39;s funny that the best linguistic source for type designers
    comes from war &#40;via cryptography&#41;. There&#39;s also another source for
    trigraphs &#40;and higher&#41;, but that&#39;s a huge unsorted list that would

    <BR>Very classy stuff. <BR> <BR>I think the outside serifs on the &#34;C&#34;,
    &#34;G&#34; &#40;on top&#41; and &#34;S&#34; need more length. <BR>I&#39;m not
    sure about the &#34;J&#34; - try a serify terminal. <BR>The leg of the &#34;K&#34;
    feels cramped on the inside - maybe try a descending form? <BR>Give the &#34;L&#34;
    a wider base &#40;look at the &#34;T&#34;, and remember the all-caps factor&#41;.
    <BR>I would flare the &#34;M&#34;. <BR>I would make the head of the &#34;P&#34;
    slightly larger. Maybe. <BR>The tail of the &#34;Q&#34; seems to flow too much
    into the body on the left. More juice, please. <BR>The &#34;Y&#34; seems to need
    a heftier top. <BR>The tips of the &#34;Z&#34; &#40;and &#34;N&#34; at the bottom

    thanks for the positive feedback. I like the J myself, but I may try a different
    treatment--sometimes things look alright until you change them. Then they look
    better! The K is probably the strangest glyph to me, but I&#39;ve tinkered with
    it constantly. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>-Addison

    belong to this typeface. <BR>I guess it&#39;s too &#39;cute&#39;, I don&#39;t
    know. <BR> <BR>About the K, what about trying  something more like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/caslon/540/win-t1/140376/character/004B/CP2/1/">
    Caslon 540</a>? <BR>I&#39;m thinking about the way the three strokes should meet
    each other &#40;or not&#41;.
