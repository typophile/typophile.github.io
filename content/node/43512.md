body: "I am looking for a quote regarding compromise & type design. I had a good one
  from the Typography papers from 1997, #2 but alas I didn't get a photo before I
  returned it to the library. I am 90% sure It was from the last paragraph in the
  article by Robin Kinross:Type as critique.\r\n\r\nIn a worst case scenario I still
  have one alternative quote up my sleeve so no worries - but if anybody has a different
  favored quote regarding compromise & type design I would love to read it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    you don't know what the text will be</em> [...]."

  body: That sounds like it comes from the paragraph - yes. It says something like
    "making letterforms for a font is necessarily an exercise in compromise". So you
    have it?

    questioned about having to compromise to realize his designs:\r\n\r\n\"I have
    never been forced to accept compromise, but I willingly accept constraints.\""

    our predetermined sense of form. This is not compromise, it is a resolution of
    the natural  confrontation of visual elements.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
