  learning of a specific font created by the layering of several classic, historical
  fonts with the ultimate aim of creating a truly incredible font in its own right.
  These individual fonts were literally (supposedly) drop vertically on top of each
  other, and with some modification this NEW FONT LEGEND WAS BORN.\r\n\r\nI forgot

  Neville Brodi but I can't be sure.\r\n\r\nSincere... sincere thanks everyone. Cord"
