    could buy at one time (digitized) would have been sold by Bitstream - as Firenze
    ITC Normal."

  body: "ITC Firenze was also digitized by Image Club in it's pre-acquisition days.
    It's on their old Letterpress CDs before about 1996 (which I have). I found one
    reference to an alias of 'Florence' for this, which is what 'Firenze' means, but
    figured this might only lead to bootleg fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Face, which is similar, but not identical. (Odd that you used 'fat face' to describe
    it Yves.)\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
