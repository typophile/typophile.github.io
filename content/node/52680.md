  font is used in this poster by Methane Studios for the band Mission of Burma.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mission_5614.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
  long as I have you here, one more question: anybody know what typeface Typophile
  uses for it's identity.  It's pretty beautiful.\r\n\r\nThanks all!\r\nZach"

  body: Actually, the new logo is set in Doublewide. The headline face is sponsored
    and change from time to time. A box on the right tells you which it is (currently
    Zocalo Display). Apart from that there's a little bit of Verdana and Georgia on
    here:)
