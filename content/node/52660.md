  Man, it was pretty grueling, they work the crap out of you.\r\n\r\nI took Type 1
  from Leah Hoffmitz who is an excellent type and logo designer. She does a lot of
  freelance work for Landor in San Francisco, and she drew both the FedEx and Banana
  Republic logo.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we spent a good 4 or 5 weeks working on 2 logotypes;
  1 corporate, 1 retail (or just smaller company). Just to let you know, these were
  not originally done on the computer by manipulating a typeface, they were both sketched
  and painted on tabloid paper in Plaka before more revisions, and then digitization.
  My corporate logo is for Nikon (camera company), the second is for a hat and clothing
  company called Brixton.\r\n\r\nI've had about 4 weeks of feedback from my teacher,
  so I was just curious to hear what some of you guys had to say about the logotypes.
  Thanks!\r\n\r\nJosh"

    I think it would fit better with the simplicity you've got going with the rest
    of the characters. \r\n\r\npenn"

    definitely needs some kerning adjustments\", what letter spacing is problematic
    for you?"

  body: while working on it, I mentioning to my teacher that I felt the 'ko' felt
    a little tight, be she assured me they were not. She would tell me its not a mathematical
    thing, like you can measure the space between letters to space them. She always
    told us "pretend you are filling the space between 2 letters up with sand, that
    amount should fit perfectly between all the letter spaces in the whole logotype.

    me they were not. </cite>\r\n\r\nhmmm, interesting. Maybe my eyeballs are betraying

    far as Brixton, it seems to have a few issues:\r\n\r\n\u2022 the triangular mass
    on the t feels too heavy.\r\n\r\n\u2022 the x feels upside down (low-waisted)\r\n\r\n\u2022
    hard to tell at low rez, but I think your overshoots might be a little exaggerated?
    can't tell for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brixton1_4935.jpg]\r\n\r\nlastly,
    not trying to be a stick in the mud, but here's an interview with the person who
    drew the Fed Ex logo for Landor, Lindon Leader.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/cat_secrets_of_the_fedex_logo.php\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.leadercreative.com/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks for the input back, i appreciate everything you said Beejay.\r\n\r\nTo
    clarify about the FedEx logo, she did not come up with the concept and design,
    she drew the logo, and has flat files full of sketches and drawings to prove.
    Funny though how she was mentioned at the beginning of that link as being \"typography
    professor leah hoffmitz\".\r\n\r\nI like what you did with the t, but I am unsure
    about whether or not I like the x the original or flipped way. Maybe i have just
    been looking at it too much lately.\r\n\r\nOverall though, I feel like I did an
    okay job for my first term type 1 class. It was really awesome drawing and painting
    type from scratch. We also painted 3 \"Hamburge\"s in different styles, which
    really helped how I look at type."

  body: The "ko" is a bit tight to me, but I think beejay added too much space. We're
    talking hair-width adjustments, so it's going to be slightly subjective.

  body: "apologies if my post implied that Leah had not contributed to the Fed Ex
    logo. But saying she 'drew' the Fed Ex logo probably wasn't accurate either.\r\n\r\nout
    of curiosity, I emailed Lindon Leader and he was kind enough to reply so...\r\n\r\nLeah
    Hoffmitz' contribution will now be burnished into the record.\r\n\r\nLeader:\r\n\r\n<cite>Once
    I had the general concept of the logo conceived, including the hidden\r\narrow,
    I engaged Leah--one of the best type designers anywhere--to advise on\r\nthe reconstruction
    of the letterforms to best accommodate the arrow, which\r\nshe did admirably.
    However, because I had asked Leah to work with Futura\r\nBold, I was still not
    satisfied with the distinctively smaller Futura\r\nx-height, the very tall ascender
    of the lower-case \"d\"  or the relatively\r\neven Futura strokes. It was then
    that I decided to explore the possibility\r\nof marrying Futura Bold with Univers
    65. The result is what you see today.\r\nLeah is indeed to be credited with an
    important contribution to the success\r\nof the FedEx identity program.</cite>\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, the ko is too tight. And the stuff about sand between the letters is
    a helpful idea, but can't be taken too seriously either. If you try it with very
    well kerned type, you will see that it's not really true. It does need to be visually
    even in color, but nobody has a complete formula, though some out there are pretty
    good. \r\n\r\nWhen you have difficulty spacing something, I think it is often
    a problem with the letters themselves. I suspect your o or k may be too wide compared
    to the n, and that is giving you problems. \r\n\r\nFor me the black letter with
    the wood-cut look characters don't work together. "

  body: "Beejay's kerning over nikon logo is more like it. Sand/water between letters
    is the way majority teaches kerning. Also upside down reading helps, because you're
    not disturbed by the meaning of letters but rather look at shapes.\r\n\r\nAs you
    pointed out yourself: it's not geometry and calculation. It's visual balance.
    And Beejay's version is balanced. Pixel too wide or not, it's better.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not commenting on Brixton because my mind today is not at its best for such sophisticated
    lettering.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "also, although everyone has a different method for kerning, here is mine\r\n\r\nstare
    at the word without intentionally focusing on any one letter or its surrounding
    white space (kind of like what you do with those old magic eye posters). keep
    adjusting until no one letter comes to focus (if the word isn't kerned well, the
    offending letter will often come to focus no matter how hard you try not to focus
    on it.\r\n\r\nit sounds complicated but it's the method that's always worked best
    for me"

  body: also, i prefer beejay's "flipped-x" version. it makes the word read smoother
    from left to right, where as the original version kind of abruptly stops at the
    x
