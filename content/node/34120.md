  pretty sure I found this one in a movie magazine as well. Pretty characteristic

  ideas?\r\n\r\nm."

    & second D of \"dead\", the serifs seem to be shorter in the second. The small
    E from \"the\" only seems to have a downword middle serif as opposed to the E
    from \"dead\".\r\nGreat trilogy though & even the remake of \"Dawn of the dead\"
    was not as bad as many people claimed it was. And everybody just h\xE0s to love
    \"Shaun of the dead\"! ;-)"

    body: "Since it turned out the original logo is from 1985 it's probably a custom
      design to begin with, and even though Latin Wide might serve as a good starting
      point for making a custom design oneself, I'm really looking for a font that's
      much closer to the Day of the Dead logo as can be seen here http://www.impawards.com/1985/day_of_the_dead.html
      or in the scan I posted.\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly the erosion is just
      a bad scan, the text was probably as clean as in the poster.\r\n\r\nI tried
      checking out Saracen on myfonts.com but there was no preview available, and
      the previews on typography.com were too small to tell how close to the target
      this one is, and the test drive function wouldn't let me enter any text of my
      own. Still, I got the feeling it might be closer to the target than Latin Wide.\r\n\r\nI
      guess what I'm really hoping for is a modern day font version based on the Day
      of the Dead logo. But thanks for taking the time, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."

  body: "Maybe. But it could just as easily be the very poor scan. If it is a custom
    design, I'm fairly sure the magazine just pulled off a poster or something.\r\n\r\nI
    had assumed it was the new movie http://www.impawards.com/2006/day_of_the_dead.html
    ...\r\n\r\n... but after another search it's obvious I've been looking at the
    wrong decade http://www.impawards.com/1985/day_of_the_dead.html ;-)\r\n\r\nI wonder
    if the magazine simply scanned the poster, rearranged the words, and reduced the
    height of all text. Hmm...\r\n\r\nWell, if anyone knows about a Day of the Dead
    font I'd be very interested.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."

  body: "This movie is from 1985 and concluded Romero's Dead-trilogy.\r\nHe was however
    involved in the remake of \"Night of the living dead\" & actually approached Tom
    Savini (who initially wanted to apply as a make-up artist for the original, but
    due to circumstances (I think army duty) didn't make it) personally for remaking
    his classic. In 2005 Romero made a fourth contribution to his trilogy (I am aware
    of the contradiction in my terminology BTW) called \"Land of the dead\".\r\nIf
    anyone should be interested ;-)\r\nI've seen different fonts used throughout several
    posters & covers for at least the \"actual trilogy\", but this was very common
    in those days. I've even seen promotion posters for \"Alien\" with an alien drawn
    on it that doesn't even resemble the one in the movie by a long shot. This was
    due to the fact that artists were often asked to do a poster without having seen
    anything or knowing anything about the movie except for the title."

    called \"flare gothic\".\r\nIt looks different from saracen, and a bit in the
    style of this logo.\r\nNot sure if it's a renamed typeface or not though. It indicates
    DTC as the origin here. (I also see an alternate version called \"Flange\" from
    berthold 1992)\r\n\r\nIf anyone has more info, I'd be glad to hear about it."

    I know was a Les Usherwood design, which used to be offered by Scangraphic, but
    they changed the name to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/flower-sh/\">'Flower'</a>.
    It's not much like the Latin serif styles, such as Saracen.\r\n\r\n[edit: NOW
    I see why the name was changed. Here is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/flange-bq/\">Flange</a>
