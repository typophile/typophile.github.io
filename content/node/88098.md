  body: "The most similar font I was able to find was Ray Larabie's <a href=\"Social
    Security\">Moon Cresta</a>. It could be modified without too much gruesome work
    to resemble the Yachting masthead, especially if one were not examining them side
    by side. The t crossbar could slide over, and the stem be truncated. The g tail
    could be similarly truncated. I'd use the l.c. y to enlarge and then tweak for
    the Y. The rest could pass without changes, as long as you were not using the
    calibrated eyeballs that many people seem to have here.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
