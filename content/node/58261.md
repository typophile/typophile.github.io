body: "I love the high contrast look of Coru\xF1a, but sadly on a lot of printers
  it can cause major problems with any size below 12.  I'm not sure yet I want to
  compromise the x-heigh in an optical variant, if only because I don't have it really
  clear the effect that'll have on a script like Armenian, or the balance when mixed
  with hebrew or arabic.  So for the moment, I've darkened the thin strokes and buffed
  up the serifs which has a noticeably nice effect.  I then interpolated to grab an
  even thicker one, a caption sized-one if you will.  Of course the difference is
  subtle and I might still change the x-height, and definitely will the spacing, but
  it looks good.  I still need to do the capitals and alts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/corunna_optical_4328.png]"
