  know what it is? It's a nice modern compact serif that seems to derive from transitional
  roots.\r\n\r\nSteve[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5413.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to have some similarities to  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/renault-sh/|Renault,

    but much of the same character...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe notion of your originality
    is only protected by the obscurity of your inspirations"

  body: "I just love the clipped, concise nature of the serifs... That G rocks, and
    the lack of any serifs at the apex of the A... For someone who has been addicted
    to Sans for so long (and frankly afraid of Serif typefaces as there seems so much
    more subtlety in their choosing) this one is drawing me to it like a magnet...
    \r\n\r\nIt's a no sh*t kinda serif, and I love it!\r\n\r\nFor now I'll have to
    experiement with Renault, as I still think it's the closest overall.\r\n\r\n"
