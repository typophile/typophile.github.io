body: "Hi guys\r\n\r\nI'm snowed under and would appreciate a suggestion or two? \r\n\r\nI'm
  designing a 100 page private equity book. It's A4 landscape so that the content
  will translate easily to the web (pdf downloads). \r\n\r\nI was initially looking
  at using a mixture of Memphis light for headlines and Helvetica Neue for body, as
  I need faces that will work online as well as in print. However I realise I'm using
  old favourites rather than pushing the envelope.\r\n\r\nWondered if anyone had any
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks as always!\r\n\r\n"

    body: They will be PDF'ed an put on the website for downloading, so people can
      either view the PDF or print it out to read - hence the need for clear legibility
      both on-screen and in print

  body: We'll need to narrow things down a bit in order to give you some good suggestions.
    What is your project and audience?

  body: "The project is a venture capital year book, talking to VC's, financiers,
    brokers and  management particularly those interested in MBO's. \r\n\r\nThe style
    will be end of year report and accounts.\r\n\r\nI like both (helvetica and memphis)
    fonts and generally they work together, the title this is a spin off from is much
    more conservative and set in Times NR and Verdana."

  body: That reads excelently onscreen and also works in print. A bit braver than
    Hel. neue - which I have used to death and am bored of. Any thoughts?

  body: I'm not an expert on this, but I believe some, if not most, end user license
    agreements prohibit .pdf embedding, so you will need a typeface with a more lenient
    usage agreement.

    We publish several magazine and newsletters in a downloadable pdf format and have
    done for some years.\r\n\r\nPresumably this doesn't affect web pages as well?"

  body: Actually, many allow PDF embedding as long as it is <strong>Print & Preview</strong>
    only. But, when you get into <strong>Editable</strong> then you are right, most
    do not allow this. If you look graph compiled by myself and Nathan Matteson, you
    can see that quite a few allow <strong>Print & Preview</strong> embedding.

      PDFs to only allow printing (not hi-res).\r\n\r\nGetting back to my point, can
      anyone suggest a font for corporate usage that is like Hel neue but a bit more
      edgy? "
