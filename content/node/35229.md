body: I'm looking for a typeface similar to Cambria but with a bit more pedigree.
  Small serifs, easy to read and modern-feeling. Any suggestions?

    feels similar to me. Maybe <a href=http://typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/index.html>Mercury
    Text</a> (or Display, depending on the size you want). <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/enigma.htm>Enigma</a>
    might work, although it''s a bit more out there.'

    well respected, although much of his recent public work has been in corporate
    type. Or is that you have a problem with MonoLino? "

  body: "I didn't mean to depreciate the work of Jelle Bosma, in fact I am completely
    in love with Cambria. That said, since Cambria has become the default serif typeface
    for Microsoft Office, I am afraid it will become banal to the eyes of people who
    aren't as savvy about typography. \r\n\r\nI was hoping to use a font for my personal
    documents (r\xE9sum\xE9 and such) that can act as a signature in itself, while
    remaining very readable and professional. \r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards ITC Slimbach
    at the moment."

  body: "Thanks for clearing that up - I think your original comment got lost in translation
    somewhat. :-) You're right that we'll be seeing a lot more of Cambria in the future,
    but as it's not the default text face (currently) in Office, then it won't be
    as over-used as say Calibri in the short-term. You might be able to stretch 12
    to 18 months before feeling you need to change. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si  "

  body: "I suppose this may not be the case over where you are, but here in the States,
    ITC Slimbach has started to appear everywhere in a lot of what I would call mid-level
    and novice design work. It seems to have been on the rise during the past year
    or so. I don't know why (since it was released back in 1987). To my eye, it's
    a lot more overexposed than Cambria.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    \"future-proof\" than Cambria. Do you have any other suggestions?"
