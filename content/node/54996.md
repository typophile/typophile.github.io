  body: "First, I enjoyed meeting Chris. He's a great guy. During the Q&A at the end
    of Carter's talk, someone asked a great question that I'd never thought of before:
    \"Do you as a type designer find that what you want to put into a font differs
    greatly from what I, the graphic designer need from a typeface?\" Carter said
    that, yes, the needs are sometimes very different, but necessary to take into
    account.\r\n\r\nAbove, Chris makes the point about fame being overrated. Carter
    was introduced as a famous type designer, but humble, and I'd have to say that
    seems to be true. He's funny and self-effacing.\r\n\r\nThe title of Carter's talk
    was \"Why New Typefaces?\" His premise is that there are so many typefaces out
    there already, why would the world need new ones? He answered that question from
    his point of view.\r\n\r\nHe provided a bit of his background, which includes
    the fact that his dad worked in a type foundry, but did not push or encourage
    Matthew to follow in his footsteps. Carter sees himself as a technician, having
    carved type into metal, designed it for photolettering processes, and then digitally.\r\n\r\nCarter
    used his titling face Mantinia as a case study. He points out that it is a Renaissance
    face, not a classical Roman one like Trajan. He had been studying writings, sketches
    and etchings made by Andreas Mantegna and his friends as they made their way around
    an Italian lake. THe letters Carter saw in Mantegna's work and that of his friend
    Felici Feliciano inspired the typeface Mantinia (Latinized version of the name
    Mantegna).\r\n\r\nCarter also talked about his work for the Walker Art Center
    in Minneapolis. One innovative thing that came out of that was his development
    of Walker Sans, which has with it 3 different styles of serif that can be applied
    to the characters using particular keyboard commands. Personally, I thought this
    was really wild, and can see where such a concept could become more popular in
    the future.\r\n\r\nCarter talked about his work with Newsweek, which he was not
    originally commissioned for. A friend of his had mentioned a need for a certain
    kind of typeface, which fit the description of Vincent, a face Carter had started
    on, but was no where near finished, and had kind of been on Carter's back burner.
    Months later, the friend said, \"By the way, Newsweek likes Vincent.\" Carter
    said, \"Who's Vincent?\" And the friend said, \"That typeface you sent me\u2014they
    love it and want to proceed with it.\" Carter was dumbfounded, as he described
    the typeface as being in a crude state. So, that turned into a set of 5 versions
    of Vincent for Newsweek. At this point, Carter said that he's not really into
    seeing his typefaces used in fine books, posters, annual reports, etc., in which
    the designer has the time to really craft how the type looks. He prefers to see
    his work used in quickly designed things like newspapers and weekly periodicals,
    because that shows how well he really designed the typeface.\r\n\r\nCarter briefly
    mentioned work he's done for Sports Illustrated and other publications.\r\n\r\nWhen
    asked about the trend of designing matched pairs of serif and sans serif typefaces,
    Carter said he prefers that there be as much contrast as possible between serif
    and sans faces used together. He said he thought Frutiger looked good with his
    Galliard face.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if there were any typefaces out there he wished
    he'd designed, he said there were many, and that he thinks there are more really
    good young type designers out there today than at any point in history, but he
    wouldn't name any so as not to create bias or hurt the feelings of folks he might
    leave out.\r\n\r\nChris, or any others who were there, feel free to edit.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n<em>Inventor

    Carter showed a slide (yes, a real slide, not Powerpoint) of outlines of 3 versions
    of a lc h from one of his typefaces, overlayed on one another. This was to show
    the differences between the three weights, including width of strokes, width of
    characters and placement of the bezier points. He walked over to the screen and
    pointed to one area that showed the differences in point location between the
    three weights and said, \"That right there is where I make my money.\" He was
    emphasizing the importance of detail in the craft, and that those details are
    what separates excellence and quality from the rest of the pack.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n<em>Inventor

    at TypeCon and talking with him, that he is first of all an enthusiast, a fan
    of great type. It made me happy to realize that the love of type unites the master,
    the tyro, the journeyman. I think that's what great about the type design community:
    you're not in it unless you love it. "
