body: I'm hired to perform various marketing functions for a restaurant.  I am counting
  on your discretion but the NY franchise of this establishment has not been able
  to identify the type face of the original logo.  It is very close to Olde English
  and Gregorian FLF but I have yet to match the font exactly.  I fear that the type
  was modified and/or combined with another.  The restaurant was formerly an Italian
  restaurant in Paris that was purchased by the founder in 1959 - so the font was
  created pre-1959.   I haven't found any type face that comes close to the unusual
  capital V.  I hope the experts here have sage advice for me.

    nailed it, brother: your best bet is either to accept a close substitute, or to
    commission a custom font."

    just the name or an entire custom typeface?  Best regards
