  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I would like to hear suggestions &amp; criticism so I can do it better next year.</p>
<p>Is there too much (or too little) of something?</p>
<p>For example : One change I made this year was that I didn&rsquo;t start posting images until well after TypeCon was over. The previous year I tried to get them up that night. This let me take way more shots. Did you notice or care one way or the other?</p>
<p>Also, as I have been posting photos taken at TypeCon to our Flickr Stream I have been adding explanations and descriptions. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just names but also in some cases it&rsquo;s a little bit about what the talk was about. I wanted to encourage those folks who were there to add descriptions of what they heard &amp; thought was well. That way folks who couldn&rsquo;t be there can get more out of the photo stream.</p>
<p>I have been geotagging my images. Does anybody care about this at all? Or is it just silly?</p>
<p>And finally - does anybody want to help me shoot or process or post images for TypeCon 2008 in Buffalo?</p>
<p>Here is the stream:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed is that some photos are tagged with &ldquo;typecon2007&rdquo; instead of being tagged with &ldquo;typecon&rdquo;. That is leaving some photos out of a standard search.</p>
<p>As to the stream, I think it is nice that things are coming in as a gradual thing. It gives you more reason to keep checking it, rather than one and done.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t checked the geotagging, but is it specific enough to the location, such as which restauraunt people were eating at? That might prove useful if somebody were to want to return.</p>

<p>My geotagging is specific to the block but not a physical address.</p>
<p>I will have to look &amp; see if any of my photos have the &lsquo;typecon2007&rsquo; defect. BTW You can add tags too. If you see one like that feel free to add &lsquo;typecon&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;2007&rsquo; to fix the problem.</p>
