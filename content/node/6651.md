  body: '&#39;Fecit&#39; is from the Latin <i>facio</i>, to make. &#39;Anno&#39; is
    year. The first sentence translates as &#39;Stradivarius made this in Naples in
    the year 1725&#39;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve no idea who the guys is/was.'

  body: My guess is that &#34;the guy&#34; &#40;Alexandri Gagliano&#41; was the person
    who commissioned the violin, perhaps then its first owner. <BR> <BR>Are you saying
    that you own this Strad? If so, I hope you play and very well.  It would be a
    shame for a fine instrument to go unplayed. <BR>By the way, get it insured big
    time :-&#41;

    Strad. However, we try to find out if the violin is real Strad or not. The Germans
    &#40;world war 2&#41; used to &#34;make Strad&#34;. But if the violin is real
    - I&#39;m going to sell it.

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Okay,
    this is odd. I have here in my possession a violin that I played throughout my
    schooldays. I bought it &#40;actually my parents bought it&#41; in about 1985
    and at the time it was about 80 years old. So it&#39;s about 100 now. I know that
    it was made in Germany. It has the exact same sticker that yours has, word for
    word. It also has a small serial number &#40;33&#41; stamped into the bottom edge
    of the violin just beneath the stem.  <BR> <BR>So, either, my violin is a copy
    of yours &#40;or of one made about the same time as yours by the same person&#41;,
    or yours is also a copy of the same. In my experience as a violinist, many violins
    have stickers like these inside of them.  <BR> <BR>I can also confirm that Gagliano
    was a student of Stradivarius who worked in Naples. <BR> <BR>If yours is genuinely
    a Gagliano, it&#39;s quite valuable. But it&#39;s pretty unlikely.&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: '&#62;&#62; &#34;the purchaser knew he was buying an inexpensive violin <BR>
    <BR>Unless it&#39;s sold second-hand, in which case it becomes a superb way of
    fooling people. And some people would buy such a piece exactly with that aim.
    <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; &#34;A violin&#39;s authenticity &#40;i.e., whether it is
    the product of the maker whose label or <BR>&#62;&#62; signature it bears&#41;
    can only be determined through comparative study of design, <BR>&#62;&#62; model
    wood characteristics, and varnish texture.  <BR> <BR>I guess the way it actually
    sounds is secondary... <BR> <BR>hhp'

    City, California - which is part of LA, I think... We were there visiting my grandparents
    over Christmas. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very fond of mine, good sounding instrument.
