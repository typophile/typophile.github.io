  body: Oh dear. Are you sure this is final lettering? Since the construction signs
    are still up, perhaps this is a template over which some other form of letter
    &#40;applied steel?&#41; will be put?

  body: That gap in the 1st &#34;L&#34; of &#34;HALL&#34;, right where the seam in
    the stainless is, makes me think they are preparing the surface in order to apply
    something. Are those holes, or abrasions? <BR>

  body: 'You know what? This is not Arbitaray Sans... it&#39;s a font &#39;designed&#39;
    by Bruce Mau in Toronto. <BR> <BR>/image{disney} <BR> <BR>Quoting from Bruce Mau&#39;s
    book: <BR>&#34;We began by using animation techniques to produce an exclusive
    font. It was a technique that we evolved during Zone 6, where we morphed one letterform
    into another, looking for in-between stages. The resulting font was titled &#39;A
    Font Called Frank.&#39; Clear and deceptively &#39;regular&#39; when reproduced
    on small applications such as letterhead, the font possessed complex qualities
    that are revealved when enlarged to the scale of architectural signage.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>Those &#39;complex qualities&#39;, I&#39;m afraid, are just inconsistencies!
    I see nothing &#39;complex&#39; about this interpolated font.'

  body: Bruce Mau has done some really impressive work, but his insistence of &#39;font
    breeding&#39; as the best way of creating type for corporate identities is just
    plain absurd. Maybe it&#39;s an excuse of not wanting to pay for REAL type designers
    to do the work?
