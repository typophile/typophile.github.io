  I have been looking at it so long I don't know if I have a very good objective view

  body: I love it! It's fantastic and unique! It feels very antique but also very
    contemporary. At first the lower case <em>a</em> bothered me as the odd one out,
    but it works very well in context with all the other characters. I love the <em>s,
    g,</em> and <em>y</em>. A couple of concerns, the capital <em>B</em> is very similar
    to the eszett, and the lc <em>d</em> is very close to the partial difference symbol.
    I noticed that you tried to distinguish both, but I'm not sure how others feel
    about the close similarities. Otherwise, excellent work!

  body: "It's great!   The 2 bothers me - I like the direction, but I right now I'm
    just reading it as an upside down 5, which is thoroughly distracting.   Other
    glyphs that distract from readibility for me (at text sizes): \r\n\r\ng - just
    doesn't quite flow for me\r\nD - reads as an o at small sizes\r\nT - reads as
    a c at small sizes (\"cake heed\")\r\nB - reads as an R at small sizes\r\ns -
    I like it, but \"ravens\" did read as \"revenge\" for me at a glance.  That might
    just be indicative of a psychosis on my part.\r\n\r\nAs is, I love it for display,
    and I think with some minor changes it will be impressively legible for text.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "I like this, in general. I agree with jlapiak that the capital B is too close
    to eszett -- it breaks the feel of the face. If you bring the two bowls together
    at an angle, instead of a curve, that might fix it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw the
    2 I thought \"why is his 5 upside down?\" without realizing that it was a stylized
    2. If you want to keep the weird shape, that should be fine, just make it different
    than the 5. \r\n\r\nThe uppercase A looks too much like lambda.\r\n\r\nOther than
    that, it's great.  Be sure to post again when it's available for download. :)"

  body: "It's very interesting. It looks like it is influenced by old Gaelic / Irish
    letterforms (forgive me for not knowing if there is a more proper name for that
    style). How \"out there\" some of the letterforms are from the rest kind of reminds
    me of Democratica or Jonathan Barnbrook's work. I could see this on Emigre or
    something. This looks like a typeface that was just made for ligatures. The \xDF
    is beautiful. I've not sure if I've seen one with the left side of the crossbar
    still on it.\r\n\r\nI do agree about the 2, it looks too much like an inverted
    5 for me. Good work though!"

  body: "I was afraid this is what would be said. The letters that are not working
    very well are some of the earlier forms I created and really help set the direction
    of the typeface. I guess I have to start letting go.\r\n\r\n\"the capital B is
    very similar to the eszett\"\r\nI did base the B on the eszett. I really like
    the influence of foreign alphabets into english, but German does us the same alphabet
    and I can see this could cause problems if the face was set in German. \r\n\r\n\"The
    uppercase A looks too much like lambda\"\r\nUnlike the B/eszett, this one doesn't
    bother me, because the lambda is from the Greek alphabet and it wouldn't be confused
    with the A in English. What does eveyone think about that? Am I wrong?\r\n\r\nI
    like the 2/5 shape better as a 2 than a 5. I did something like this in another
    typeface (posted here http://typophile.com/node/43604) but the 5 is very different
    from the 2. Would that help or does the 2 on it's own look too much like a 5?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with the others, the 2 is the most distracting character. It's unbalanced,
    the angularity on the bottom is very un-two in feel. I think you could take the
    curves of the 5 and use them on the two successfully by being less literal.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not crazy about the length of the lowercase s. Partly because it looks too much
    like the section symbol, but also because it seems like it was only made so long
    because you felt if it went below the baseline that it had to go as low as the
    other descenders. I think it would be a lot more readable as an s hanging only
    halfway below the baseline -- as it is, I'm tempted to read it as an oldstyle
    5 in the small sizes because the shape gets less defined as it is stretched out.\r\n\r\nThe
    lowercase t feels like it needs more time to develop into something else.\r\n\r\nI
    really love the lowercase g, j, and z.\r\n\r\nIt's always a good sign when you
    get to the end of a creative project and realize the stuff you did at the beginning
    that was the seed for the character of the rest needs to be redone because it
    got so much better as it grew. Deadlines don't always let us actually do that
    :) I know the feeling of getting to the last page and hating page 1 already, though!
    One of the best pieces of advice I ever got from a mentor was not to treat my
    creations as precious -- you can never be afraid to throw something out or you'll
    stop taking risks."

  body: "The <strong>2</strong> is strange, but somehow acceptable for me. Still would
    be better if you remove the lower part of its serif, or at least add a curve at
    front. The mirrored <strong>6/9</strong> is nice, but this is because it has no
    serifs to drop under the baseline... If the serif of <strong>5</strong> was not
    that distinctive, <strong>2</strong> could remain a mirrored design with not that
    much distraction. \r\n\r\nBut the lowercase <strong>b</strong> is really too distracting
    - too close to cyrillic <strong>\u0431</strong>; and for anyone using cyrillic
    it would be too misleading. Maybe add a ball terminal?\r\n\r\n<strong>Question</strong>
    and <strong>questiondown</strong> are unfinished - and it is obvious that they
    derive from lowercase s, some corrections should be done though.\r\n\r\nLowercase
    <strong>w</strong> is impressive, but too wide IMHO. \r\n\r\nUppercase <strong>S</strong>
    looks upside down, maybe this is deliberate decision. Acceptable for uncial, I
    suppose.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase <strong>j</strong> design catches the eye, but will
    lead to problems if you are considering designing <strong>iogonek</strong>, for
    example.\r\n\r\nAnd the <strong>numbersign</strong> is too tall (add it in front
    of some figures to check out, maybe it is just my impression).\r\n\r\nIt would
    be curious to see also some accented lowercases, especially <strong>C/ccedilla</strong>,
    <strong>S/scaron</strong> and <strong>Z/zcaron</strong>. How do you plan to make
    the accents equally distinctive?\r\n\r\nI love the <strong>fi</strong> and <strong>fl</strong>,
    designed this way. Brilliant idea!\r\n\r\nOtherwise keep the work in the same
    direction, the design is really distinctive. Maybe there will be other minor flaws,
    but you have real jewel, just it needs some polishing."
