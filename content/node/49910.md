  made a couple of revisions and trying to rectify some problems and inconsistency.
  I would really like to hear any inputs and criticsm as to how can I improve it.\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, I am quite new to this kind of stuff so please take it easy on me. =)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Specimen-1_6000.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ALPHA_5187.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type-play-q_5671.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is attractive. \r\n\r\nAre you doing overshoot on the curves? You might
    need more.\r\n\r\nThe bold 'e' (\"Boulevard\") gets too clogged - you will likely
    have to compromise on the equal stroke widths to make it work.\r\n\r\nThe spines
    of 's' and 'S' look like they're trying a little a little too hard to reach horizontal
    in the middle.\r\n"

  body: "First thing that strikes me is optical correction. Even when you are making
    a typeface based only on geometrics, optical corrections are really important.
    \r\n\r\nProblem areas are:\r\n\r\nWhere strokes join a stem (e.g. on the a, c,
    d, g, and also the r !) Usually it looks better optically if you let the strokes
    become <em>slightly</em> thinner where they join the stems. Eventhough this goes
    against a geometrical approach, it will look better. It will, for example, eliminate
    evil black blobs from appearing. You create some open space.\r\n\r\nAlso horizontals.
    Those should be slightly thinner than other strokes. This is because our eyes
    make horizontal lines look heavier. You have to adjust this by eye, so that it
    <em>looks</em> the same weight as the rest. Look at your 'e' for example (especially
    in the bold 'Boulevard). Lightly thinning up the crossbar will also open up the
    counter(s).\r\n\r\nThe same goes for diagonal lines, those usually also look fatter
    when they are actually exactly the same as the other strokes. Those need adjustments
    by eye as well.\r\n\r\nSo you have to 'cheat' here and there: it's all about <em>making
    it look</em> geometrical. Apart from that, I think you are nicely on your way.
    You could ask yourself if people are waiting for another geometrical sans serif,
    since the competition in that area is pretty heavy. But designing it for yourself;
    as a means of learning type design, it's perfect. :)\r\n\r\nFor better critiques
    on lettershapes themselves, it's best to post a PDF, so people can take a better
    look at them (and maybe even print it so to be able to judge it even better)."

  body: "@eliason\r\nI myself seems to be bothered at how the S's intersect in between.
    Looks like they are not meeting up smoothly as it should be. I'll fix that soon.\r\n\r\n@Quincunx\r\nthanks
    for some wonderful tips and will surely have a play on that optical illusion technique.\r\n\r\nI've
    Attached a pdf file of the family(except the dot version). I didn't include the
    dot version since i am having a problem importing the paths i made in illustrator
    to FL without having too much distortion. It looks ok in small to medium sizes
    but really messed up in a close up view. Any tips regarding this will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What kind of messing up do you mean?\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\n\r\nDo you mean the
    vectors getting all ugly? Since it seems this also happened to the dashed version.
    If I zoom in very close on some of the dashes, they aren't all nicely rounded
    and neat. They have... bulges on them. It looks like the control handles have
    gone bezerk.\r\nNot quite sure what you can do about this. Possibly upping the
    UPM size could help (i.e. the grid is now too coarse)."

  body: "@Quincunx\r\n\r\nYeah, it seems the control handles have gone wild during
    import. Do you know a specific UPM size value that has little to no rounding errors?
    I have tried 2000 and it seems better than before but not yet perfect and the
    bulges are still noticeable.\r\n\r\n@eliason\r\nnice read indeed..\r\n\r\nAlso,
    i have uploaded another pdf. I have changed the squiggle in letter Q to avoid
    touching problems in some letter combination (i.e. QATAR). Let me know what you
    think about it."

  body: "I think 2048 is the highest UPM setting. I haven't had too much problems
    with 2048, but you will have to try. If 2000 wasn't working, I doubt 2048 will
    make much of a difference though...\r\n\r\nMaybe there are other ways to keep
    the rounding nice and clean, but I don't know how. Maybe someone else has any
    ideas. If it weren't such complex shapes, I would edit it by hand, but that's
    not really an option here I guess."

    rounding problems and it seems there is nothing i can do much about it. Now I
    understand why people draw directly in FL but I'm just not yet ready to embrace
    FL's drawing tools, at least for now."

    an EPS.\r\nProbably a long shot, but worth a try.\r\n\r\nAlso see if you can draw
    the letters in Illustrator at the size you are working on in FL, so that you don't
    have to scale it in FL. If you're not already doing that, of course."
