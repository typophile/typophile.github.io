		<div class="commentbody">Maybe we should start a new thread just for sharing sleuthing techniques. Just generally, however, for my part: I know the names of a good number of basic faces, but most of the time I have to look things up. <BR> <BR>The first thing I try to decide is whether the font looks like it was done by an artisan or by someone who maybe has some skill but is not likely to have his/her fonts distributed by the big sites &#40;MyFonts, Agfa, Phil&#39;s, etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s even close to an artisan font, the first thing I try to use is MyFonts&#39; What the Font. That may mean that I have to do some manipulation of the sample to get something that What the Font can read well. It&#39;s a surprisingly good sleuthing tool. MyFonts carries quite a lot of foundries&#39; work, so I&#39;d say at least 80% of the queries here can be found on MyFonts. <BR> <BR>Sometimes with MyFonts it takes more detailed searches, and sometimes, like today, I just get lucky. Often I&#39;ll start with a font I think it looks like, check out the keywords listed on that page, and see which one&#40;s&#41; might be relevant to my search. &#40;Clicking on &#34;more fonts like this&#34; gives you every font that matches even one of those keywords, so it&#39;s often quite a hefty list.&#41; <BR> <BR>I typically don&#39;t find that Identifont helps me, though it doesn&#39;t stop me from trying. What helps in Identifont is to click the link that says &#34;Identify from logo,&#34; which really means, you type in what letters are in the logo &#40;case matters!&#41;, and Identifont will try to restrict its questions to what it thinks you can answer. Its database seems to be far smaller than MyFonts, and I think it could ask some better questions, but I have only myself to blame, because I never fill out that little feedback form thingy at the end. <BR> <BR>When it looks, how shall we say, like it was done by someone who wouldn&#39;t want to work for either Adobe or T-26, and vice versa, there are a number of sites I check out. It&#39;s quite time-consuming sometimes. <BR> <BR>Sometimes someone asks about a font that&#39;s only known about by the most in-the-know, and on those I bow to people here who are the artisans themselves, who have stacks of type specimens in their libraries. I&#39;m frankly in awe of these people. <BR> <BR>Finally, often I end up searching through a bunch of different small foundry sites and follow links to others. I don&#39;t usually find what I&#39;m looking for, but in these cases, the journey is usually more worthwhile than the destination, as I come across tons of interesting fonts that I wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. <BR> <BR>Other people will have more to add, I&#39;m sure! <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t think I can add much to Dave&#39;s method, which looks pretty thorough. If I fail to identify it at first glance, my first step is similar: trying to determine <i>where</i> you need to go looking is a good start. I&#39;m more of a &#34;paper&#34; researcher: a combination of FontBook and Rookledge&#39;s International Typefinder usually does the trick. If it&#39;s not in there I&#39;m pretty useless. <BR> <BR>But I think that&#39;s the strength of this forum: by combining the skills of people with different backgrounds and search methods we cover a lot of ground, and the fact that we are geographically spread out guarantees 24/7 Type ID service. Pretty kewl, innit?</div>
