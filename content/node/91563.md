  body: "Yes, with that e and n, it is clearly some version/descendant of Signal.\r\nNote
    that Wege\u2019s original version had three weights (with Script-Signal being
    lighter, and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kupfers/6001492471/\">Block-Signal</a>
    bolder). It also offered both forms of the lowercase r. It is a pity that the
    digital version is so limited."

    have been many scripts like this. Remember when we tried to ID Erik\u2019s poster

    Mammut, Flott, Blizzard, Achtung \u2026\r\n\r\nI uploaded some more Signal. \r\nLight:

  body: "Sure, it is not the metal Signal. What I am saying is that there are too
    many similarities to be <strong>not</strong> related to Signal.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nLike
    Elan, Mammut, Flott, Blizzard, Achtung \u2026\r\n</blockquote>\r\nYes, I remember.
    Still, none of these come as close as Signal does."
