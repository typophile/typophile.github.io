  'Hotel California' typography.\r\n\r\nThe cover was art directed by John Kosh (Abbey
  Road) so i'm presuming it was a custom script.\r\n\r\nAny font ideas greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SteelyKnifes_3916.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/115759928_01_6404.jpg]"

  body: "I agree Ryuk with your opinion of Drew Mellon's work. A real lettering artist
    who would have been competitive in the golden age of lettering before WW II.\r\nRecently
    I have come to the conclusion that we sometimes try too hard to show our encyclopedic
    knowledge of fonts and tend to overwhelm questioners with too many choices. I
    am now attempting to focus more in my answers on the choices that are the closest
    fit. Not easy to do, but I'm trying.\r\nDon"

    don't use online software for ID's. For me, it would eliminate most of the sources
    of satisfaction you listed. I can't criticize those who do use it, though. It's
    very, umm ... efficient."

  body: "I know what you mean Don. To me the most important is asking yourself the
    right questions. Why being actually here? Why posting? Why spending so much time?\r\nMy
    answers, all completely selfish:\r\n1- I love this game: click it, see it, zoom
    it, scan it, remind it, track it, hunt it, google it, MyFonts it, search it, dig
    it, solve it, upload it, sample it, archive it, bookmark it, memorize it... Typologic!\r\n2-
    Learning from others, knowledge is power\r\n3- I want to know them all\r\n4- feeding
    my eyes\r\n5- geeking\r\nSo believe me, I read any line you write down, looked
    at all scans and type specimens you uploaded, learnt a maximum from you most of
    the time preferring to lurk because of ignorance. I don't care being the first
    one to identify a font, I don't care being thanked or not, I don't seek for any
    kind of recognition, I don't sell anything. I'm here for the fun, for the hunt.\r\n\r\nTo
    know them all :D"

    add much except I find it feels good to be able to help someone with something
    that it is easy for me to do, good karma here -- hence my recent attempt to focus
    on what is most useful to the questioner rather than churn out too much in the
    way of choices.[Update: deleted unnecessary detail that followed]\r\nDon\r\n"
