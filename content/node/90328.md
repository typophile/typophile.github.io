  body: The headline is Jensenesque; the only thing really Devinne-like in the body
    copy is the uppercase R. Both are late nineteenth-century metal faces which probably
    have not yet been digitized.

  body: Thanks Nick, I'm interested in the body copy typeface specifically for the
    possibility of a digitisation/revival. Any advice for sources to look through?

    wouldn't be shocked to find out that it's\r\nalready been digitized. But probably
    poorly.\r\n\r\nBTW, it might be far enough removed\r\nas to be a parody, but it
    <em>is</em> a DeVinne.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
