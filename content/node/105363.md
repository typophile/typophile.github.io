  They''ve identified 1948 as a key year in their history and I want to honor their
  heritage with typeface choices that would reflect that time period. Any suggestions
  of either specific typefaces or even specific styles outside of just the umbrella
  categories (i.e. sans serif, slab, serif, etc.). Or suggestions of places to research
  and even research methods regarding this type of search. Thanks in advance. '
