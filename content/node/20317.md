    more to the previous TypeBattles were you are designing whole sets/alphabets...\r\n\r\nDo
    you draw them out and scan them in?\r\nDo you use font designing software? If
    so, what is the standard or preferred application?\r\n\r\nYou guys do some great
    work and i am just curious how you guys do it.\r\n\r\n-thanks for any feedback "

    I should have looked at the wiki.

    charm. But if I shoot with my fingers I always keep up the thumb.

  body: "I love the shading on Pieter's, and Issac I tried something like that too,
    and believe me yours is a lot better. I thought it would be funny to do a blackletter
    dingbat, but funny turned difficult rather quickly, and I had to give up, because,
    like Sebastian in Type Battle 12 WW3, my girlfriend awaits. The top one is based
    on Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch (I know I know the contrast is all wrong), and the
    second one is more of a glyphic thing, based on <a href=\"http://designforum.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentAlias=_getfullarticle&aid=1402490%20\">\r\nprotest
    t-shirt and posters and what not.</a>\r\n\r\nHopefully I can sneak away and work
    on some more later.\r\n\r\n- David\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/djr_tb13_3510.png]"

    TP12-WW3 has a pointless pointer, that does not yet fit it really. I'll first
    have to draw this with a real pen, there will be an update...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typebattle_13_sebastian_5708.png]"
