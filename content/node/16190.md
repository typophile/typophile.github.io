  project I have been fooling around with during my down time at work. I've always
  had a fascination with blackletter type and have started an attempt at modernizing
  the style a bit, maybe along the lines of Fette Fraktur but closer to classic style
  in some ways. Just curious what thoughts you might have so far on the 15 or so glyphs
  I have attempted. Thanks.\r\n\r\n-Dave"

  body: "I like the slant of the strokes, but the consistent width of the strokes
    makes it feel like it was drawn with a marker and pushes it more towards being
    a graffiti style than blackletter. I'd play with varying the stroke widths a little
    bit and see what you get. The real artistry of the 20th century blackletters was
    in how many curves they were able to cram into each glyph.\r\n\r\nThe other direction
    to go would be to explore ideas like American Text or Gothic Gothic and straighten
    things out and see if you can get some interesting effects from straight lines
    and harder angles.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting! Keep working with it!"

  body: Only one comment for now. To me the f would have better look if you try something
    else for his head. May be work with the bottom of the terminal g.

  body: I agree about the graffiti comment-- it makes me think of 1970's New York
    subway cars more than new speed-metal bands. That said, I wonder if actually reducing
    the vertical curvature would help stabilize it a bit; right now, it dances so
    much that it starts to look a bit chaotic. And notice the lower-case i and l --
    I'd think either they need the same angle if you want a more traditional, stable
    face; otherwise, you'd want to exaggerate the difference there and in a lot of
    other places.
