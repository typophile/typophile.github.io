  I have to recreate their logo and haven't been able to track down the typeface.
  \r\n\r\nIf you happen to have a link to a vector version of the logo, that would
  work even better -- and I thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nmatt\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://circuscircus.com/images/homepage_logo.gif\">Circus
