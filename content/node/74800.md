  images it appears there is a transparent sleeve (acetate) printed with fine vertical
  lines. Same for the inside paper card.\r\nBut how is it that the text disappears
  inside the card? Hard to figure out without the real thing, but if anyone has seen
  such a thing up close, please explain! :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sag1_4459.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sag2_4587.jpg]"

  body: Maybe the white lines on the outer sleeve is actually opaque and not transparent?
    And the black is semi-transparent? That's amazing. I haven't paid much attention
    to it, thinking it was just the usual moire. Should've known, it's Stefan.

  body: 'If you look closely at the top photo, it appears that the type is on the
    substrate (card) and that at least the inner sleeve is transparent. If the white
    lines on the outer sleeve were opaque, what''s going on in the right-hand side
    of the top picture and everywhere in the bottom picture would not be possible.
    More likely, the "similar to Focal Decoder" argument is correct: the sleeves are
    actually lenticular lenses which only allow the image on the subtrate to show
    when they are in perfect register. Or not...'

    similar effect. Perhaps you can get hold of a copy, might help you figure it out.
    I'm not sure that it is exactly the same but it might help.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wallpaper.com/print"
