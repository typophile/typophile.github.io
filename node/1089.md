body: A certain question has been plaguing me for months now, and it with the hope
  of receiving a definitive answer that I write this post. <BR> <BR>How, exactly,
  do you pronounce Adrian Frutiger&#39;s surname? Is it /froo&#39;-tijh-er/? Or /frut&#39;-igh-er/?
  Or some combination thereof? <BR> <BR>Or not? <BR> <BR><I>Jake</I>
