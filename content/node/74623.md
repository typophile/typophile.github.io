  Collective]] and we are starting a new project/experiment in the creation and distribution
  of type. We have written a blog post that details our plans [[http://peoplecollective.tumblr.com/post/1197076526/kickstarter-typeface-project|here]]
  but in short, hope to fund the creation of a typeface through KickStarter. We'd
  really like to hear your thoughts on both the creation/distribution concept and
  the specific design options we post to the blog over the coming weeks, thanks!\r\n\r\n-Colin

    be paid before doing the development job ; I hope there is a place on the market
    for that kind of trade :-)

    want to have that typeface designed, and who you want to design the typeface.

    if you do, it is far from obvious how to find it."

    linked to, it seems evident that they're still in a very early stage. (i.e. they
    first will propose ideas for a typeface and then they will try to finance the
    production of the one chosen by the readers)."

  body: "Thank you all for your comments, I think that Aaron & I fell victim to that
    scenario where you talk about something for so long that when you go to share
    it you forget that not everyone has been around the whole time. Thank you especially
    riccardo0, you've pretty much hit the nail on the head. To clarify what might
    have been missed in my initial post, or the blog entry we made I'll lay it out
    as quickly & clearly as I can.\r\n\r\n\u2022We are looking at creating a display
    typeface. \r\n\u2022We are looking at funding the creation of this typeface through
    KickStarter donations.\r\n\u2022We (People Collective) will be handling the creation
    of the typeface.\r\n\u2022We will, over the next few weeks, post 3 type sketches/directions
    to our blog.\r\n\u2022We will create the typeface which garners the most interest/discussion.\r\n\u2022We
    chose to fund the creation through KickStarter so that we can distribute the typeface
    for free. \r\n\r\nWe haven't put a KickStarter page up yet, that will appear once
    a typeface has been chosen to create. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping this clarifies things
    a bit, again, thank you for contributing and stay tuned!\r\n\r\n-Aaron & Colin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    if they will get the font for free?\r\nThat seems to run against the intent of
    KickStarter.\r\nIt will give the investors a R.O.I. and free fonts for non-investors,
    while reducing creators' remuneration -- all of which run counter to the intent
    of KickStarter, which states that:\r\n\r\n\"Creators keep 100% ownership. Kickstarter
    is a new form of commerce and patronage, not a place for investment or lending.\" "

  body: "I could see Kickstarter working for an established type designer, if say
    Nick, Zapf, Chank or Carter were to set something up. The resulting font could
    even be given away, with donators perhaps getting a special edition version or
    signed specimen or something. But for newbies the traditional routes of myfonts
    or dafont seem more appropriate. \r\n\r\nIt could work for a type design newbie
    if they have followers in other areas - perhaps a musician or minor celebrity
    (Balloon Boy or Jerrod from Subway) might attract enough curiosity to attract
    a couple of $K. \r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your commets guys. Nick, the route we are looking at is more along
    the lines of Diaspora and This American Life, those who can contribute do so that
    the rest of the population can enjoy the product. When Kickstarter say \"Creators
    keep 100% ownership\" they are referring to Kickstarter themselves not owning
    any part of the funded project. If we fund the development of a typeface through
    Kickstarter, then that typeface is ours to do as we wish, which would be to make
    it freely available. \r\n\r\nAs we mentioned on our blog post, there will be other
    benefits and rewards for contributors, as there is with other Kickstarter projects."

    are taking a different approach than is conventional... :-)\r\n\r\nI see you are
    using the Google Font API on your website. \r\n\r\nI'm currently working in the
    Google Fonts API team, and we are funding the development of freely sharable and
    modifiable fonts (\"libre fonts\") for the API :-) \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can make
    a large contribution to the Kickstarter fund... You can fill in https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEtpRm5vbTg5dUtiT3JJMmFHU1ZBNlE6MQ
