  body: "I did, here [[http://www.typophile.com/node/43874]], but your reply at that
    thread was not very helpful. Instead of saying merely '<strong>lose the drop shadow
    ... definitely</strong>', you might have offered to say <em>why</em> you made
    this suggestion, rather than expect compliance uncomprehendingly. \r\n\r\nI opened
    <em>this</em> thread hoping to get away from that sort of comment."

  body: "Sorry that you feel I personally made you start another thread.\r\n\r\n<em>\"rather
    than expect compliance uncomprehendingly.\"</em>\r\nI didn't expect anything.
    It's your work, I offered a suggestion, I don't think the drop shadow adds any
    use to the \"logo.\"\r\n\r\nYou posted this in the Logo critique section, so I
    was commenting on the 'logo' on the site. But the problems run much deeper. The
    'type' used feels rigid, as does the structure of the information, it's all very
    tight and confusing in its structure.\r\n\r\nWhat's the site about, what's the
    meaning of tepid air in relation to the site, why the colour choice, who is your
    audience, what are you trying to communicate?\r\n\r\n... perhaps your approach
    is wrong.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

  body: "Thank you, Ratbaggy, for this comment. I take your point about the purpose
    of the site being identified rather vaguely, and have made a change to the brief
    description in the header.\r\n\r\nAs for the 'structure' of the site, as you will
    have seen, it <em>is</em> organised logically, and with navigation obvious, despite
    your comment here that it is '<em>confusing</em>'. The structure of the individual
    pages are, likewise, logical and with extra navigation as necessary.\r\n\r\nIt
    is possible much of your objections arise through visiting the site under a Windows
    OS. Of this I am aware and, because this is a personal site, I am not particularly
    concerned to create a site which is rendered more-or-less similar under several
    OSs."

  body: "Drop shadow detracts from a clean look, and is pretty pass\xE9 by now. Most
    of the time it is best left out unless you need it to distinguish letters from
    the background. And you'll find that purist type aficionados will usually be against
    it because it presents the letters with unintended baggage.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'd take it off, and make the med. gray one shade darker to compensate.\r\n"

  body: "fontplayer, \r\n\r\nThis 'logotype' looks far too 'tepid' without the drop
    shadow, as seen here  [[http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/readred_2007/tepid_air.gif]].
    Here, nothing has been changed, just the shadow removed.\r\n\r\nI have tried using
    a slightly darker grey, but I feel the shadow gives both colours a better degree
    of separation from the background without resorting to 'reflections', while still
    allowing lighter colours.\r\n\r\nI hear what you say about <em>unintended baggage</em>
    and '<em>fashion'</em>, but I don't pretend to be in the vanguard; I'm still struggling
    to catch up with the rearguard!"

  body: "I'm not using 'effects for effect's sake' here and, personally, I rather
    do without the shadow, but this is my 'problem'; \r\nI really love the shape of
    the word 'air' in this font and, being in the ranks of the amateurs, I cannot
    find alternative fonts which I like for both words, produces the same effect in
    the word 'air' and still looks good, to me, completely unadorned.\r\n\r\nOriginally,
    I used 'Amerika Sans' which also made a lovely shape in the word 'air' but looked
    horrible in the word 'tepid'."
