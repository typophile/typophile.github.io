  themselves as an agro-tourism destination and they will sell coffee and tangerines
  using the brand.  They want a an upscale/quality feel, not a traditional agricultural
  look.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEdgardo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_6345.jpg]"

  body: "In my opinion a nice Serif would give this a much more elegant, upscale and
    quality feel. Specially with that background pattern. Or perhaps some humanist
    sans. Something that has a bit more stroke variation. \r\nWhat does the circle
    represent? I see a sun. What's the concept?\r\n\r\nThe colors seem to match agricultural-feel.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nKco"

  body: "Yeah, the colors represent agriculture.  What I ment by agricultural-feel
    was to avoid traditional elements like obvious leaves, rivers, mountains, trees,
    crops, etc.\r\n\r\nThe main concept is the environment of the Hacienda.  The \"levels\"
    you feel when you go there, the soil, the mountains around and the sky.  The circle
    put it all together and represents the products.  Using the star to represent
    the sun also segments the circle which produces pieces similar to what you find
    when you cut an orange/tangerines or other tropical fruit.\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    feedback.\r\n\r\nE."

  body: "Great direction.\r\n\r\nI support what Kco suggested about using type with
    some visible \"stroke variation\", or perhaps making some subtle alterations to
    the existing type to accomplish the effect. As for the background pattern, it
    seems a little too linear or digital. Maybe along with humanizing the logotype,
    you can humanize the pattern a bit. I guess it depends on what you're trying to
    accomplish.\r\n\r\nAloha!"

    really.  I worry that changing the font might make the product feel too upscale/luxury
    related and might affect retail sales with a higher cost perception.  What do
    you think?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nE."

  body: "First, i like it as it is, logo and font. Maybe a bit neutral.\r\n\r\n>I
    worry that changing the font might make the product feel too upscale/luxury related\r\n\r\nI
    think the guys ment, that you can give it some more human touch with a serif/slab.
    Your use of the chosen font, which is an extended weight and all written in caps,
    goes in the upscale etc. direction already. I would try a slab, to check out how
    far i could go, for example with a slab-serif. Standards like PMN Caecilia, Scala
    Serif, to see how it works together.\r\n\r\nWhat you could try otherwise, following
    \"the more human\" direction, but stay \"clean\":\r\nI like the combination Avenir,
    Scala Serif a lot. Avenir has this slightly constructed feel and still being friendly.
    And Scala Serif for text. Both works good together, has nice contrast. \r\n\r\nJust
    my 2cents"

  body: i love the colours used and saw they represented soil, trees or grass and
    the sky. immediately madew me think of farming. i'm liking it. i love the one
    on the left because of the colour pallete you have used. it gives it some deeper
    meaning where as the one on right cant be interpreted by me as soil, grass and
    sky but if it was really really well established like for decades and decades,
    then it's ok coz it's well known then but i think you should go for the one on
    left. i think you should leave the font san serif coz if it was serif, it would
    look too luxurious and upper class etc.

  body: "It doesnt have to be a Serif typeface. I see the shape of the icon mos as
    an organic shape even though it's geometrically placed. Your typeface seem soo
    straight, geometric and every stroke is the same width. Look at the top of your
    \"A\" and its very squared wich your logo isn't.\r\n\r\njust my opinion, \r\n\r\nKco"

  body: I agree with your concern. It's a very good logo, but at present it looks
    very corporate, like a massive global oil/drug/agro conglomerate whose executives
    sat down in a city boardroom and said "can the boys in marketing do something
    to make the consumer perceive us as more 'green'?"

    you're really set on a sans, Optima might be a good solution or maybe something
    that's a little less \"hard\" at the edges? Trying to set the type smaller might
    actually work with your font."

    them (what my old boss called \"sing\").\r\n\r\nOverall though, quite nice indeed.
    Its heart is in the right place."

      have you thought about adding a little orange accent somewhere?

  body: I'm liking this one very much. It really communicates a certain quality. Maybe
    a small touch of bright color somewhere, can add a bit more buzz to the design.
    However, it's not really necessary, I like it the way it is now as well.
