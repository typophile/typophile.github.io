  It is also available in ePub format. So after a while, I switched to the iBooks
  version (which I generally read in Iowan). \r\n\r\nI suddenly realized the typeface
  used in publishing the book is about a 1000 times more readable than ANY of the
  iBooks fonts. In face all the iBooks typefaces now look ugly to me. \r\n\r\nI am
  stunned. What is this beautiful typeface? Why is this typeface SO MUCH better for
  reading than any the ones provided in an app specifically meant for reading? Each
  word is so clear that it almost leaves an imprint on my brain. In this day and age
  of retina high resolution screens, why do we not have appropriate typefaces for
  reading on electronic devices? Or just anything that matches the beautiful printed
  one in readability?\r\n\r\nI am almost depressed because I can clearly tell I love
  the printed book typeface but am unable to say why exactly. I can understand the
  effect but am not yet able to discern the cause. Where/how can I learn about how
  to tell what makes a good typeface good? Any good books?\r\n\r\n"

    from 1930.\r\nThere is also <strong>Am Sans</strong> by Volker Busse [2005] a
    digitized version of Vogue.\r\nYou can read more on Vogue here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/72745\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/730"

    the McGrew book \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\". The samples
    in the Jaspert book \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" do not match, even though
    they are supposed to be the Intertype version.\r\n\r\nAm Sans does look like a
    fair re-creation of Vogue.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "In response to your comment about why you find that type easier to read,
    \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" by Robert Bringhurst might be a good place
    to start. Interestingly, you picked a sans serif style, which supposedly is not
    as easy on the eyes for extended reading. Your reaction might have more to do
    with the spacing between lines and the simplicity of the letterforms. Some of
    the fonts available for iBooks are not really designed for the screen. I think
    Georgia, which was designed by Matthew Carter for screen use, could be easier
    for reading, if not as stylish (whatever that means to each of us). In my experience,
    fonts with larger x-heights tend to be easier to read at a variety of sizes. One
    I use a lot is Pratt by Nick Shinn, but I think Fedra Serif, by Peter Bilak is
    also very easy to read. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I may be the only one, but when I read PDF versions of books on the iPad,
    I sometimes find the \"print oriented\" type quite challenging to read.  The typefaces
    may be Sabon or Baskerville, but the letters are very sharp and fine, almost attention-seeking-ly
    sharp... Perhaps they would look better when printed with ink on paper, so that
    the text spreads and evens out just a little? \r\n\r\nI do feel churlish for wanting
    less sharp, less detailed text on screen though... :)"

  body: "Mike, thanks for the book and font suggestions. Amazon Primed the  Bringhurst
    book :-)\r\n\r\nI have ready several books on typography but I still don't have
    a clear language to assimilate/understand  type faces and typography in general.
    Using Matthew Butterick's \u2018Practical Typography\u2019 and \u2018Non-Designers
    Type Book\u2019, I have learned some rules. But those are just rules. I still
    lack an innate grounding when it comes type.\r\n\r\nYou may be right about the
    fact that I liked the printed book type better because of factors like spacing
    and so on. So many things other than just letterform face structure come into
    play to make something readable.\r\n\r\nI have also noticed I gravitate towards
    geometric sans serifs. If I am restricted to using the default fonts available
    in MS Word, I always prefer to use Century Gothic.  To me it looks like the font
    allows the content to 'breathe' . Most other default Word fonts look all scrunched
    up, like they are poor little calves squeezed and crushed together in a cattle
    car. Of course Verdanaand Georgia are always nice, but dull to me.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There are a vast number of sans-serif fonts, but in my opinion most are not
    suitable for reading extended text. My criteria include: a fairly high x-height,
    not compressed width, generous space between letters, fairly light, letters that
    are not too unconventional -- this can be distracting from the objective of scanning
    for content --, and letters that are not ambiguous, e.g. _l_, _I_, and _1_. Others
    \ ambiguous letters include  _O_ and _0_. Intertype Vogue does not get top marks
    for all of these criteria, but it's fairly good.\r\nTypeface design for extended
    reading is a struggle between the designer's wish to make a distinctive typeface
    and the reader's wish for a comfortable reading experience that enables effective
    comprehension of the content without delay. In my opinion the best type designers
    are able to reconcile these objectives.\r\nDon\r\n"
