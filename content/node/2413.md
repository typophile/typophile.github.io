body: I don&#39;t have a scan handy, but does anyone know off-hand the primary head
  and body text fonts used in Harper&#39;s Magazine &#40;also, their new sans-serif
  caption font, if possible -- looks kind of like Cronos&#41;? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll see
  if I can get a scan if no one remembers off the bat.

  body: The major heads are some form of Caslon. The smaller heads and body text appear
    to be Goudy Oldstyle. I just happened to have a copy of the mag here. This issue
    is from July 2003, though, so I don&#39;t know about the new caption font. Paul
    Ford of <a href="http://www.ftrain.com">Ftrain</a> just did their new website,
    so if he can&#39;t tell you, he knows who can.
