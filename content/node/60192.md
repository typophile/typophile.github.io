  new look for all their publications. \r\n\r\nThey want to use ITC Eras for as their
  display font. It feels dated to me but what do you think? Not sure if I should work
  hard to convince them otherwise.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd really appreciate any suggestions
  about how to choose a body font to pair with it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    and using it will be a liability make all new assets\u2014 web and printed materials\u2014look
    like an anachronism. Just say no!"

    Sorry about the self promotion."

  body: "Sure it's dated, like a Lambo.\r\nSo you gotta ask, how will you make 1960s
    high-tech go-faster styling work for a social justice non-profit?\r\nWith some
    retro styling, perhaps?--try negative tracking the hell out of it, or at the very
    least, \"tight but not touching\".\r\nBecause when Eras isn't set ultra tight,
    it's just not right.\r\nSo to go with that tight set, choose a small x-height
    text face and set it solid in narrow columns rag right.\r\nChoose from any contemporary
    ITC face--light weights of ITC Souvenir or ITC Garamond would be cool.\r\nMy <a
    href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/pratt.html\">Pratt Pro</a> would work that look
    too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks Nick and SuperUltraFabulous. So far, it sounds like Eras really isn't
    the right choice and I should push for another bold sans font...
