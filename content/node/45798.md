  common through out towns and cites. Through my years in design I have accumulated
  a number of fonts but not what I would call the \"Font Eye\". That undefinable ability
  my fellow designers possess that allows them to identify font styles at a glance.\r\n\r\nSo
  I came to the source. I appreciate anyone's help identifying the attached image's
  font style or something close enough.\r\n\r\nThanks so much.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Address_Plate_4342.jpg]"

    It could be that this is not a font but a set of figures designed for this use
    only. Someone will dig up a match if there is one out there though."

    well the sign shown above doesn't especially say \"Switzerland\", you'll find
    them as well e.g. in France, Germany, ..., but for a general central european
    feeling it'll be fine. "

    know, you can choose whatever you like - as long as it's decipherable.

  body: "^ good one. It appears that these figures are more condensed and the thin
    didot style strokes have been beefed up\u2014possibly to stand up to the production
    methods, but also for distance viewing.\r\n\r\nRoman Solid has the slant, but
    is too wide. If you don\u2019t have so many of these to do you might draw them
    or modify a character set.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RS_6150.png]\r\n\r\nPrillwitz
    for comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PW_4677.png]"

  body: "Hey all, thanks so much.\r\n\r\nIf it is not Roman Solid, the font, is most
    certainly, based on it. Everything matches, I have about 2 dozen images that include
    all the numbers and they all are the same, maybe a little less heavy and a little
    more condensed. As Jupiterboy mentioned this is most likely do to manufacturing
    needs. It does not show it in the image above but the plates are embossed( numbers
    are produced in a stamping machine) and then the plate is bowed out. Net result
    of all that is that they are very readable and visible.\r\n\r\nBiggest difference
    that ruled out Prillwitz was the twos and the fives. On the twos, the stroke towards
    the foot makes a slight curve, Prillwitz has a sharp, crisp angle and the address
    plate fives do not have the small flourish at the upper tip of the five.\r\n\r\nYou
    all saved me a ton of time rooting through fonts. I do not own Roman Solid but
    at least I know where to buy it."
