  NO FANCY COMPUTER, no nothing. NOTHING BUT HIS TWO HANDS AND A FEW BRUSHES. THIS
  MAN A TRUE MASTER OF THIS CRAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEd \u201CBig Daddy\u201D Roth
  was a founder of what later became known as the Kustom Kulture movement, starting
  off his career as a painter and hot rod builder in the 1950s and eventually creating
  world-famous characters like Rat Fink and wild show cars such as The Outlaw, The
  Beatnik Bandit, Mysterion, and Rotar. Working the show car circuit in the 1960s,
  Roth promoted his bubble-topped customs, sold airbrushed monster t-shirts and promoted
  Revell model car kits based on his own designs and creations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the
  years he worked with a variety of Kustom Kulture icons, including Robert Williams,
  Ed \u201CNewt\u201D Newton and Von Dutch when the two artists worked for the Brucker
  family\u2019s Movie World theme park in the 1970s.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, the man
  nicknamed \u201CBig Daddy\u201D influenced nearly every niche of the car hobby,
  from traditional hot rod and custom builders to lowriders and Detroit designers.
  In fact, many credit Roth\u2019s drawings and show cars as a key influence on the
  resurgence of \u201Ctraditional\u201D hot rods that have regained popularity today.
  Roth passed away on April 4, 2001, but his use of bright hues, wild bodywork, outrageous
  monikers and over-the-top promotion has turned his original show cars into rolling
  art, and most have been snapped up and restored as icons of a highpoint in automotive
  design and expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoth\u2019s cars and choppers are so famous in
  custom culture circles, they rarely changed hands over the four decades since the
  heyday of traveling custom car cavalcades and road shows. \r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/500px-Ed-big-daddy-roth-outlaw_4489.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ed-big-daddy-roth_6453.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/openweb_3672.jpg]"

    the graphic arts. When I was a kid, I used to copy his Rat Fink cartoons, drawing
    with Magic Markers on my friends'' T-shirts. '
