  whole England performance, terrible!\r\n\r\nI like the Algeria font, although it's
  a shame the numerals are not the same. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11506_4258.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  realise most of the shirts have a generic manufacturers design but it's a shame
  the typography doesn't reflect the countries a little more.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else
  been following the shirts rather than the game?\r\n"

    far!\r\nThe Puma font looks way too busy and strange, especially when set in lower
    case only (never understodd why some teams seem to prefer lc only).\r\nAnd the
    adidas font\u2019s just terrible, you can\u2019t really tell the difference between
    certain letters (e.g. /A/ and /R/) during the match when in motion. Every insight
    about readability and legibility is sacrificed to a perceived fancy look."

    nice if Umbro (England team\u2019s manufacturer) had used Johnston Underground\u2026"

    to me, not England. Not UK.\r\n\r\nI say use fat face for names and numerals.
    That would be seriously awesome. Maybe in reverse italic!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/2939072218/sizes/o/in/photostream/\r\n\r\nor
    even a forward italic one like this\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/4679670718/sizes/l/in/photostream/"
