  body: I believe that's a slightly modified <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/insignia_std_roman/?&sample_text=CUSTOM%20GUITARS&sample_size=48&acs_pt=32&update=0">Insignia</a>.
    You might also want to take a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/dessau_pro/?&sample_text=CUSTOM%20GUITARS&sample_size=48&update=0">Dessau</a>
    as an alternative.
