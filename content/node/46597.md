  body: "It looks like Chalet by House industries to me (specifically Chalet London
    1970), but with the 'c' adapted.  Whoever did this has also replaced the X with
    one of the other X's in the Chalet collection.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: You can see the proof <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/house_industries/chalet_london_1970/?sample_text=mamucabo&sample_size=74">here</a>.
    There might also be an added stroke and the 'b's ascender was chopped.
