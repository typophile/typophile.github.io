  in one spesific size&#41;. <BR>I have made it already in photoshop, but can&#39;t
  seem to get into fog&#40;4.1&#41;, without it losing it&#39;s sharpness or size!
  <BR>Is there a spesific way to do this? The net is full of these fonts, so I thought
  it wasn&#39;t very hard to make?! <BR> <BR>Michael '
