  profile for a semi large company. I have never worked with companys this size -
  that put out annual reports and that kind of large publications, so I dont know
  if the baskerville will work in all the necessary form - tables, very small compact
  pargaphs etc. If you have any experience on baskerville in these contexts, please
  give me some advice.     '

  body: Nice little family. Should make a great annual report, etc., - Baskerville
    makes a very readable book font and this also has elegant display options. I would
    suggest that you specify a companion font for the occasions (such as tables and
    diagrams etc.) that probably won't really suit it. Probably a useful condensed
    sans, but keeping the options quite limited, as with this Baskerville family.
