body: "Hello all, \r\n\r\nI'm excited to let you know that we at Fontlab Ltd. have
  just released the 2nd beta of TransType 4 for Mac OS X. With this build, you can
  convert any font (OTF, TTF, plus a number of other formats) into WOFF and EOT webfonts.
  \r\n\r\nTransType 4 beta 2 is available free of charge at http://bit.ly/trt4macbeta2
  \r\n\r\nThe current build 4762 will expire on February 28th, 2013. However, by the
  time that build expires, we will post another build with more features and bugfixes.
  \r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nThe \"Webfont TT\" export profile now includes the EOT compressed output
    format as well as some sample CSS and HTML documents and SVG output. We plan to
    improve the SVG output, but \u2014 anyone interested \u2014 please test the EOT
    output on Internet Explorer, and report your findings on http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=8704.msg28770
    \r\n\r\nOther improvements that I've announced in this thread above are planned
    for future builds! \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"

  body: "Hello Adam,\r\n\r\nThanks for TransType, I have tested it once and it was
    very fast, quite useful.\r\nI still have a question/request:\r\nAre you going
    to add a function to add meta-data for woff fonts?\r\nOr is it already possible
    and I missed it? I must say the interface was a bit strange at first\u2026\r\nI
    could find \"effects\", but not this function that is more important IMHO.\r\n\r\nOther
    thing: it would be nice to know what is actually happening in the box\u2026\r\nObvisouly
    when one converts a PS font to EOT, what happens is that the file gets automatically
    converted to TrueType curves, before being packed in a EOT (or am I wrong here?).\r\nIt
    would be good that the program actually explains what is happening when something
    fundamental (such as converting PS to TT automatically) is being done.\r\nFrom
    my experience, the results with this are pretty bad in terms of hinting.\r\nFonts
    that were carefully PS hinted (with links) looked better in PS WOFF than in EOT.\r\nFrom
    our tests, it works better to convert to TrueType in FontForge, which also does
    a good job at keeping PS links and where the TT autohinter isn't doing a bad job.\r\nAny
    plans in that area?"

  body: "Short: yes on all counts but gradually :) \r\n\r\nTransType 4 is completely
    rewritten from scratch using our newest technology (codenamed Victoria). The technology
    will be used in the font editing products we're working on. TransType 4 is the
    first application based on this, so we want to cover base ground first, and make
    sure that the core functionalities work well. \r\n\r\nThe Webfont TT profile always
    converts to TT first. We'll likely add a Webfont PS profile, which will generate
    OTF, OTF-based WOFF and TrueType-based EOT (only TT outlines are supported in
    EOT). \r\n\r\nWe also have plans in the area of better autohinting, more flexible
    outline conversion control, and WOFF metadata (currently there is no such access).
    \r\n\r\nI agree that the Effects functionality is not \"core\" for most font vendors.
    It's just a simple \"extra fun\" added on top. \r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback!
    \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"

  body: "xy,\r\n\r\nI recommend reading what \"profile\" means in the TransType context
    -- in the preliminary TransType 4 manual. \r\n\r\nTransType has a selector for
    export profiles in the top-right corner. Currently, the only webfont-related profile
    is \"Webfont TT .woff+.eot+.svg (Optimized)\". \r\n\r\nThe \"TT\" in the profile
    name indicates that it's TrueType-based. It means that any input font is converted
    into a .ttf and then converted into .woff, .eot and .svg. \r\n\r\nThe profile,
    in fact, generates a series of fonts: .ttf, .woff, .eot, .css, .html. \r\n\r\nAs
    I said, we're planning to add a Webfont PS profile, which will generate three
    PostScript-based files (.otf, .woff and .svg) plus one TrueType-based (.eot).
    \r\n\r\nThis means that the .eot will be identical regardless of whether you use
    the Webfont PS or the Webfont TT profile, since only TrueType-based EOTs are supported
    by Internet Explorer. \r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

    from FontLab's autohinting? \r\n\r\nI'd greatly appreciate if you could elaborate
    on this. We'll be listening carefully. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

  body: "Dear Adam,\r\n\r\nJust saw you replied.\r\nIt's great to read that you are
    really interested.\r\nTo be honest, I cannot elaborate much because my knowledge
    and understanding of TT in general and TT hinting is very limited. It is my partner
    who has more experience with that. I'll ask him to elaborate when we get some
    time. So I cannot say if the problem lies in the quality of the curves conversion
    (although my partner was saying that FontLab was creating TT outlines with too
    many points) or with the hinting.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment what I can say is
    that our experience was that exporting our PS fonts (with PS hints placed manually)
    in .TTF and making webfonts out of them resulted in quite poor results. From what
    I remember of our tests, it was almost always looking worse than with .OTF (CFF).\r\nThat's
    why I'm quite surprised about the TT profile only. I don't really see the advantage
    of doing that. For sure TT are needed for EOTs, but other than that, I wouldn't
    want our fonts to be converted in TT, unless the curves and the hints were translated
    into something of at least equal quality than the PS versions.\r\n\r\nLooking
    forward to a version of TransType with PS profile!"

    thing I wish could be improved is ligatures. Even though the original font has
    the ligatures f_i and f_l in the correct positions, these are not recognised as
    ligatures. Adding a basic set of OT features like liga would help."
