body: "Hi everyone!\r\nI'm trying to identify what font(s) were used on this dial
  plate for a Watterson Radio that my dad is working on restoring, and having a hard
  time pinning down the exact font. It seemed similar to Futura with a few differences
  here and there. The radio was produced around the 1940's before the US entered World
  War II, so there weren't many of them made:\r\nhttp://www.radiomuseum.org/r/watterson_78.html\r\n\r\nI
  have the dial plate scanned if that helps out with identifying what font(s) was
  used on it. You can click on the image to see its full size:\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/44lCUv2.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/44lCUv2.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn
  the event that it's actually made specifically for those radios, is there something
  similar that could be used? Thanks for your time!"
