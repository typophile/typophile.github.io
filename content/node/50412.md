  I'm in and am looking for a nice sans serif font for body text. It needs to be clean,
  slightly condensed and it should be capable of a some torturous glyph scaling in
  Indesign.\r\n\r\nthe only font i can think of is Vectora but I've used that to death.
  Anyone with any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks for the time!\r\narjun\r\n"

    everyone! Thank you so much for the interest. I have uploaded a few images of
    my project so you can have a better look. The lamp is called moonflower and has
    been displayed in the top most image. the second and third images were taken for
    the purpose of putting them as full bleed BG shots in my final presentation. A
    Few paragraphs of text would be running around the page in a good grid.\r\n\r\nI
    really liked Grotext! Thank you Stephen. I think that it would be perfect for
    the moonflower! Its the best image as of now. The presentation is in two weeks
    but will try and upload some trials with fonts in the near future. Do keep font
    ideas coming! \r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nArjun\r\n\r\nPS; More images can be found
    on the project blog - http://protocoled.blogspot.com/"

  body: "Grotext? Really? I always have trouble thinking anything but \"children's
    book\" when I see it. And call me stupid if you like, but I don't see the blackletter
    in there (and folks at my classes have been telling me I see blackletter everywhere).\r\n\r\nAnyway
    \u2013 I'd even try something really blackletter-ish. <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Kaas/mudTyper+Weights/\">Kaas</a>
    comes to mind; see attach, I hope you don't mind my quick comp. Maybe something
    lighter, but equally modern, would be very nice too.\r\n\r\nI like how the lettershapes
    interact with the origami-like shapes of the lamp (Hrant's quote of the \"crystalline
    flower\" is a wonderful way of putting what I probably want to say here :) ),
    and how they're oscillating between historical (& \"home sweet home\" style traditional)
    and techno aesthetics.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kaas1_6161.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kaas2_5864.jpg]"

    I know: couple Kaas to Stratum (by Eric Olson).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Maybe next time I'm actually going to read the question. :->\r\n\r\nStratum is
    a drop-dead idea. Jeez. I'd love buying both of these and starting to play around
    with them right now!"
