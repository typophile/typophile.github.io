  for the capital Q's I like for a design I am working on for class. \r\nI would like
  some suggestions of which type faces out there have nice capital Q's. Right now
  I am not thinking about the message behind the Q just which ones look good and I
  like, then I will narrow  them down to which ones make sense to use. "

    butt up against each other, thus making the characters appear from the negative
    spaces.
