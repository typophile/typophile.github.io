    handles sending emails. I think you're stuck with opening a mail app.

  body: ">somehow handles sending emails\r\nTrue, i have to look at the presets of
    the Reader and Acrobat Pro or maybe it is a presetting in Outlook Express.\r\n\r\nNo,
    Outlook works like it should do - online and offline, but there is the browserwindow...\r\n\r\nThanks
    and a good christmas time for you"

  body: "What you are looking for is an illegal operation; the RFC protocol for the
    <strong>mailto</strong> function states:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>A mailto URL gives a template
    for a message that can be sent by mail client software. The contents of that template
    may be opaque or difficult to read by the user at the time of specifying the URL.
    Thus, a mail client should never send a message based on a mailto URL without
    first showing the user the full message that will be sent including all headers
    that were specified by the mailto URL), fully decoded, and asking the user for
    approval to send the message as electronic mail. The mail client should also make
    it clear that the user is about to send an electronic mail message, since the
    user may not be aware that this is the result of a mailto URL.</li></ul>\r\nIt's
    not a matter of esthetics: it's a matter of security.\r\n"
