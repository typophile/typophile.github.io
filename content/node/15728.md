    you can still find it?\r\nMy thinking was that the latest post does not show up
    in the Forums page so people assume there are no posts.  There were other theories
    as well.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    rarely agree with me) but here we are still...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    new material in the other threads as shown on the front page.  So, I think Chris
    is right.

    not the forum page. This way, I see each thread that has a new post. I stil can't
    always tell whether or not something is a critique, but I recommend using Typophile
    through this angle. It is the best way not to miss a beat (according to the current
    site design\u2026)"

  body: "Dan,\r\nI have tried the Tracker.  It has problems too.  The left column
    instead of repeating \"Forum Topic\" again and again, should show WHICH forum
    the post was from. That way if someone was looking for Critiques posts, they could
    look down the column and find them.  Even better if you could sort by forum so
    a user could group the things he/she was interested in.\r\nThe tracker could also
    list the name of the recent poster with the time.  This would help you decide
    if you want to read it.  For instance; if I was the last poster to a thread but
    can't keep track of exactly how many minutes/hours/days ago that was, I don't
    want to reread my own post.  If my post was addressed to specific people as a
    question, I would look to see if those people had answered.\r\nI have also tried
    the \"my Threads\" listing which sorts in some bizarre way.  Instead of putting
    the most recent post at the top, it sorts by when you first visited that thread
    so you have to scroll your life away to check everything.\r\nI am sorry. I know
    this sounded ranty. I don't mean to dump on our bunch of very fine people who
    volunteer their time to make this site work.  Please don't take any of my spewing
    personally.  I know you are all doing the best you an with the time and resources
    you have to work with.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    the time as I saw him tinkering with Typophile at TypeCon during his spare time.
    \r\n\r\nThe tracker would be more useful if we knew from which area the threads
    originate, but, instead of wishing, perhaps, at this present time, we should visit
    as many threads as the tracker spits at us and watch for the critique area if
    that is what we need to do.\r\n\r\n"
