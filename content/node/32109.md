  The boats are a blend of retro 1950's boat design and modern technology and I'd
  like to reflect this in the design of the brochure.\r\n\r\nI've had a look at various
  Gothic typefaces which seem to bridge (no pun intended) both design eras and quite
  like the combination of Bell Gothic and Minion. However, this combo seems to lack
  the dynamicism I'd like to allude to (the boats are quite fast and maneuverable...)
  Another nice option is Futura, but it just feels a little dated. I've also looked
  at a few modern classics like Meta et al, but haven't hit on something that really
  fills me with the right vibes.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a nice combination that
  might give the kind of feel I'm after? \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for any/all
  suggestions."

  body: "Jon, you gotta get yourself over to eBay and pick up some copies of Outboard
    magazine from the 50s perhaps some old CrisCraft brochures . . . Futura is the
    most era appropriate of what you've mentioned . . . Check out some of <a href=\"http://www.fontdiner.com\"

  body: "That's Storm's DynaGrotesque DXE Bold Ital\u2014with an outline.\r\n\r\nThe
    face has a big range and I'm somewhat interested in how people perceive it. It
    has a sense of speed but also softness. You could very well set extended text
    in the regular version, though this fat ital may be too soft for what you are
    doing."

  body: Many thanks for everyone's replies... in the end I went with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/agenda/">Agenda</a>
    which had the 'classic with a modern twist' I was after. It's possibly a little
    formal, but my friend is after an up-market, affluent clientele and didn't want
    anything too 'comedy' (as he put it).
