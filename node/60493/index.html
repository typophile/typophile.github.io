  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all, this is an identity in progress for a non-profit based here in Houston. The basic idea is an organization that exists simply to try to help people have a better day and remind them that someone does care. It&rsquo;s started with small gives just to put a smile on people&rsquo;s faces (like buying coffee for everyone in the drive-thru at Starbucks) and is moving into doing bigger projects for people in need as funds permit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with a variety of ideas for the identity and have arrived at these variations of a mark and type, I don&rsquo;t love them but I like the direction. I feel like the angled version has the idea of a bit more movement and progress associated with it and like the idea of both, but I&rsquo;m not opposed to going an entirely different direction if the idea presents itself. Fire away :)</p>

That said, the mark, albeit very clever, tells me more EXIT than encouragement&hellip;
I think something moving upward too would work better.</div>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go too casual with it. For a typeface, try something like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grover<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Sudtipos. I&rsquo;m not saying it has to be a rounded font, but I&rsquo;d suggest something a little quirkier than what you&rsquo;re using. Then, make the mark fit with whatever type you&rsquo;re going with.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks guys. Cool thoughts on the typeface Lex, I&rsquo;ll take a look at some other options. and riccard, I had the same upward thought and had drifted away from it early on, I&rsquo;ll revisit that.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t hurt to try to reverse it, good thought. We&rsquo;re actually looking at a saturdated slightly reddish orange for the brand color, the initial idea was to use it reversed out against that color. I&rsquo;d also like to develop a mark that&rsquo;s distinctive enough to be used on hats, tees, etc., without the type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This is real quick, and probably not the right treatment, but feels a bit lighter and less stern, which is what I think your logo is missing. Stay with it, there are tons of possibilities for a logo like this!

<p>If you are referring to my post, please be aware that I am not the one designing the logo. I don’t want to confuse anyone or unintentionally misrepresent my example as the work of the designer who started this thread.</p>
<p>I was just trying to give a quick example of something a bit more relaxed in style. I agree with you that it is difficult to read. It wasn’t my intention for him to copy my example, just spark some ideas.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there&hellip; 
Maybe stack the &ldquo;the&rdquo; (3 lines of text) so that the text element isn&rsquo;t so long. Other than that, I really like the angled version. Remember there will be context to help the concept of the logo. I think it already states the &lsquo;pay it forward&rsquo; message. Perhaps the icon can be a color? I dunno&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s close.</div>
