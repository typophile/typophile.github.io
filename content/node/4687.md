  body: I like this design a lot. bowl on &#34;R&#39; could be bigger and hang lower
    &#40;as illustrated in second &#34;R&#34;&#41; . shorten center horizontal on
    &#34;E&#34;. &#40;as illustrated in first &#34;E&#34;&#41;. Btw &#39;R&#34; could
    be smoother but working quickly in photoshop without beziers can look a bit rough
    as shown. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35515.jpg"

    <BR> <BR> <BR>The joins on your M, N, V, W are too thick, <BR>they are visually
    distracting. Try thinning  <BR>these a bit, or slapping in some traps  <BR>to
    balance. I agree with ole about the e,  <BR>and the R needs something done, looks  <BR>like
    it has steeped in a mince pie and is <BR>leaping back. I think the S is a bit
    wobbly <BR>in regards to stroke weight as well. <BR> <BR>here is a good link for
    hints on spacing, <BR>which will inevitably help with the overall <BR>design:

    <BR> <BR>By the way, is it sweet to show my stuff to the <BR>man? Or is it a pain
    in the backside for him? <BR> <BR>kris.'

  body: 'Hey, Ive been a bit busy to really get stuck into this but here is something
    to look at. The arrows indicate the new characters.Ive straightened the bowl as
    suggested by Ole and fiddled with the trapping on the M. This is still really
    rough as all the strokes are different widths. I will fix this in good tme. <BR>
    <BR>Keen to get some suggestions <BR>Cheers<!--attachment: JENKINS_BITS-36804.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*24.4*Bits*JENKINS+BITS%2epdf

  body: 'The new M is hard to judge outside the context of other letters but in the
    abstract it does look better. <BR> <BR>The R seems better too - it is starting
    to remind me of the logo for rolls-royce. '

  body: 'Hi Ashton, <BR> <BR>Your M is displaying a common problem: The Flat Point.
    <BR>In an effort to get the dark spots out of the tight angles it is tempting
    to make the joint very wide. In the end it is a balancing act. The goal is to
    make it look like the points are the same width as the stem or smaller, while
    keeping the joins free of clogging. You have four weapons to fight with: <BR>
    <BR>1. The widening the join &#40;as you&#39;ve done&#41; <BR>2. The widening
    the whole glyph &#40;opens the angles&#41; <BR>3. Subtle tapering of stems &#40;opens
    the angles&#41; <BR>4. Trapping <BR> <BR>In the following example I&#39;ve used
    less of 1 and more of 4. The darker the weight, the more gymnastics will be required
    for even color. This glyph is pretty light and maybe could survive with no trapping
    and a bit more #2. How you mix the weapons is part or your thumbprint on the font. '

  body: Nice, Randy! <BR>The &#34;M&#34; in fact is the trickiest UC glyph for me
    - although as you show it&#39;s mostly a &#34;mechanical&#34; problem - nothing
    like the organic intractability of the lc &#34;g&#34;, by far the hardest glyph
    in Latin &#40;at least in its binocular form&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
