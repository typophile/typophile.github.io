What bothers me is they made their conclusions based on extracting the information from posted PDFs. I think that could skew the results any thoughts? Its also only US papers</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The study is clearly titled as being US papers only. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(So it's not like the World Series.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any paper, anywhere, can post their front page PDF to Newseum.org, which Ascender Corp. used for their study data. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, the study is skewed, but Ascender's work is self-sponsored, and they had to draw the line somewhere. it is not a massive study such as the Poynter Institute might undertake (which would still probably focus on the US, but would no doubt include papers who don't post on Newseum, and weeklies). SND would be more inclined to do an international survey. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is quite ingenious of Ascender Corp. to use Newseum and PDF font-info to come up with this information, no matter the skew.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Having seen the initial results, we helped to unskew them a bit but were otherwise uninvolved until they published, which happened ironically enough at the Poynter Institute. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This was, in my opinion, and among other things, a brilliant, quick and easy way of getting a survey of what newspapers who post on newseum, use.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We did however notice a number of users who failed to install fonts beyond the alphatypes, and also found a few un~~~~~~~~ed users.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It also points out that there is a lot work in this seemingly tiny slice of market, partly because there are a lot of new papers world wide, but also because display type churn is a great slow constant&hellip;someone, somewhere, is always looking for good newsworthy display faces.</div>
