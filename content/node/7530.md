    sometimes it just feels <i>good</i> to be an overenthousiastic immature Belgian
    bozo.

  body: Grr.. The only reason you beat me to it is because I was building the link

    I wonder if we need to start keeping score. Stephen, have you gathered any statistics
    around this?

  body: I had a 3-minuter yesterday, but no one noticed because everyone else was
    pursuing six degrees of Coles at that moment. OK, it was Souvenir, but still,
    that was three minutes <i>and</i> a link...!

  body: I know, Dave, but you were already ranked up there in the Typophile Hall of
    Fame. I still needed my first 3-minute score. No way I&#39;m gonna set the frequency
    of my e-mail app to less than 9 minutes. I&#39;ve got work to do, you know. <BR>
    <BR>And BTW Trajan is not more difficult than Souvenir Bold. I&#39;m not saying
    this was particularly hard or anything.
