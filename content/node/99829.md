body: "Back in August, there was a discussion on the OpenType developer list (subject:
  '<init> and <fina> in Indic scripts?') regarding Indic shaping engines limiting
  layout input and context to individual clusters, preventing contextual interaction
  across syllable boundaries. Although some concerns were raised about possible impact
  on existing fonts if this behaviour were to change, I believe this is a minor an
  unproven concern vs. the clear problems raised for Indic typography by this limitation.\r\n\r\nI
  have prepared a discussion paper -- i.e. a paper to prompt discussion -- illustrating
  some of the problems that occur in Indian typography that cannot be resolved without
  cross-cluster layout interaction. This paper is available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/Problems_for_Indic_Typography.pdf\r\n\r\nAlthough
  I will likely draw attention to this paper in other forums, it would be helpful
  if discussion were conducted on the OpenType developer list (on the grounds that
  most of the relevant software implementors will see it there). Subscription information
  here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otlist.htm"

  body: "Currently, ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009 (the OFF standard within the MPEG standard)
    makes no implementation recommendations for Indic script layout. The Microsoft
    Indic font specifications are not part of the ISO standard; indeed, the OFF/OTF
    specifications notoriously are <em>not</em> OTL implementation specifications,
    but only font format specifications.\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft Indic font specifications,
    which do specify layout behaviour for the scripts, probably do need to be changed
    to explicitly account for cross-cluster lookup interaction. My reading of the
    current specifications is that they don't explicitly prohibit it, and implementors
    have simply presumed that because the cluster is the basic unit of script shaping
    anything beyond the cluster can be ignored, whereas, I am arguing, this is clearly
    not the case after basic shaping has been done. Yesterday, I spent some time testing
    a new build of the open source Harfbuzz layout engine, and am pleased to report
    that it does not impose this limitation. So I think a change to the Indic specs
    would involve adding some specific wording regarding this behaviour, rather than
    changing existing wording.\r\n\r\nChanging existing layout engines is a tougher
    nut to crack, especially if the makers are concerned about the affect on existing
    fonts and documents. I suppose we could do the classic sfnt data compatibility
    manoeuvre and define an OS/2 bit as a flag for new fonts and engines meaning 'Allow
    cross-cluster lookup interaction in Indic script layout'."

  body: "Update:\r\n\r\nI've been testing a new build of the Harfbuzz layout engine,
    which works perfectly with cross-cluster lookup interaction. Harfbuzz is not as
    widely deployed as the MS and Adobe layout engines, and not as critical for my
    clients, but it is a good demonstration that what I am asking for is possible
    and, so far as I can tell, not difficult to implement.\r\n\r\nAdobe have test
    fonts, and are looking at this issue."
