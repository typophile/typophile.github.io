  I can't remember his user name (you helped me with the arabic poem a couple of months
  ago, so if you read this, please contact me). I was wondering if anyone else has
  the ability to type arabic. I need the phrase ONE FAMILY (i think it's AAYLEH WAHADA
  in arabic) typed in arabic, as outlines, so I can edit in Illustrator. I appreciate
  any help. Thanks!\r\n\r\nJason"
