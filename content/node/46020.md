  road signs]].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe typefaces \xBBInterstate\xAB and \xBBHighway Gothic\xAB
  are quite similar, but I need to know the official one. For example like \xBBDIN\xAB,
  which is used for road signage in Germany.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

    \r\nI don't think you will find a digital font that matches this one exactly.
