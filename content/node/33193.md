body: Does anyone know of a website, or book, any resource really, that displays and
  identifies some of the beautfully hand crafted thick and thin serif's of the sixties,
  a bit like the Monotype modern fonts or the one shown. If I search all the usual
  font foundries I get the same old stuff coming up again and again and if I seacrh
  for sixties fonts etc i get the usual rubbish trown up by tacky online PC font shops,
  nothing remotely crafted. Please help me find a better resource for beautilly crafted
  type of days gone by.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6088.jpg]

  body: "One reason the sample you posted doesn't look like the garbage from the '60s
    is that it's not. It's Poster Bodoni, which Myfonts credits with being designed
    by Chauncey Griffith in 1929. The similar Ultra Bodoni is credited by Mac McGrew
    to Morris Benton in 1928.\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, you gotta remember that the Sixties reintroduced a lot of styles that
    were popular in the late 1800s, primarily Art Nouveau. Look at Alphonse Mucha's
    illustrations of women with long, flowy hair wearing garlands and surrounded by
    flowers, and you'll see the similarities. Except in the 60s they bumped up the
    chroma of all their colors about 1000% so that everything vibrated... And Bodoni
    and Didot are contemporaries of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see the old beautiful
    types make a comeback, but it may be a while yet before they come back around.
    It reminds me of what my late grandfather said: \"You keep that tie long enough
    and it'll come back in style!\""

  body: "You have to remember that during the 60s, development time for a typeface
    was quite long. Nothing like the quick stuff done today. Most type used in the
    60s was much older. You had the Bodonis, Clarendons, Cooper, and a big dose of
    AG in Europe as well.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
