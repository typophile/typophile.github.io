  type is used on, what formats it may or may not be converted into, and whether or
  not the license can be resold.\r\n\r\nbut!\r\n\r\ncan licenses be taken a step further
  - and be used to enforce how a font can be used ... aesthetically? i.e., face may
  not be mechanically extended or compressed, may never be combined with comic sans,
  its lowercase may not be letterspaced, it may not be extruded and printed in hot
  pink spot ... etc.\r\n\r\nwhat say you typophiles?"

  body: "that would probably vary alot from country to country. i can just talk about
    switzerland, but such things would probably never be claimable  in front of a
    judge, so its not really worth anything. AND i dont think that would be a good
    thing. you create the typeface, the designers have to live with it, not you.\r\n\r\nfor
    example, the headline font of a well known car manufacturer (the name has five
    letters, starts with M, ends with da..) is base12, but they useit  160% extended
    (!) - what ugly thing, but hey, its in the brandbook, and if you're just an intern
    like i am, you wont ask mazda to change its global brandbook just because you
    think (and are right) that this is pure bullshit. but with your idea, i'd have
    broken the eula! not mazda, but i. "

  body: EULAs can contain anything they want. However, stuff like that could probably  not
    hold up in court. I'd guess.

  body: "As Tiffany says, a licence agreement may contain any provision, so if the
    licensor says \"you can't use this above 14 pt size\" and the licensee does, that
    would be legal grounds for the licensor to cancel the contract.\r\n\r\nBut really,
    there are practical ways to channel the aesthetic usage of fonts, such as:\r\n\r\n1.
    make the type \"small on the body\" if you want to encourage a spacious look\r\n2.
    fit it very tightly (i.e. narrow sidebearings) if you want it to be used for display\r\n3.
    price it high to avoid the riff-raff getting their hands on it\r\n4. similarly,
    don't sell through mass distributors\r\n5. provide condensed, regular and extended
    versions to reduce incidence of horizontal scaling\r\n"

  body: As Tiffany says, a licence agreement may contain any provision. Furthermore,
    as Tiffany also says, the courts have (to put it mildly) a say in what is legally
    binding. Just because something is included in a written contract doesn't make
    it legally binding. As mentioned by Kesh, the legal rules vary from country to
    country. I'd suggest that you carefully consider the ethical ramifications of
    a provision before you add it to a (standard) contract.

  body: "Nick is right, if you want to control or influence the way your type is used
    you need to have a relationship with the user. Trying to legislate good use via
    the EULA isn't going to work. Providing a manual containing best practices, and
    providing templates is likely a better approach, but still you can't teach everyone
    to be a typographer.  \r\n"
