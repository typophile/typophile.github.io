    of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/old-style-7/|myfonts.com]] description:\r\n<blockquote>The
    name Old Style No. 7 comes from a time when foundries released a variety of typefaces
    under one name. Linotype produced Old Style No. 7, which was based on an early
    1870s typeface from the Bruce Typefoundry, which had based its design on a type
    from the Scottish foundry Miller and Richards.</blockquote>"
