body: Hi everyone, does anyone recognise this typeface? Used by an English department
  store circa 1900 - 1950. At first glance I thought it was good ol' Franklin Gothic,
  but the T, E are noticeably wider. Many thanks for your time.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5757.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4229.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5642.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_5728.png]
