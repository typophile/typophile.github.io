  time I guess :-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm looking for some inspiration and new blood to
  my font collection, so I'm hoping to find a list of favorite fonts from leading
  brand designers in the world. I have found some examples on http://fontsinuse.com
  (amazing site!).\r\n\r\nAny links people?\r\n\r\nTIA and Merry X-mas :-)\r\n\r\n/S"

    your own typographic identity. Why not browse <a href=\"http://typographica.org/on-typography/my-favorite-font-sources-a-shortlist-of-trusted-foundries-and-retailers/\">some
    of the better sources</a> and build your toolkit based on your own tastes instead?"
