body: Any idea about this serif on an LP from 1985?  The top line R's are swashes,
  but the regular R is below.  The G, a, and g are fairly distinctive.

    body: Ah, thank you!  Sounds familiar - I think I saw this in the ATF catalogue
      of 1912 or 1923, last time I looked at them at our library.  Now that I look,
      I see the URW digital version is in Gordon's "1000 Fonts".
