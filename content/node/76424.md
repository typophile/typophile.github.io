    You might find it in there.\r\n\r\nBy the way, like many foundries of the era,
    Gans made many \"copies\" of other popular typefaces, and Dalia may be their version
    of Middleton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/delphian_open/?&affid=99346&sample_text=P%C3%93SITO%20MAR%C3%8DT&sample_size=60&acs_pt=32&update=0&affid=99346\">Delphian

    listings. Stephen's suggestion is probably as close as you'll get...

    think the Dalia is based on the Ibarra serif.\r\n\r\nI just managed to find the
    Gans pdf specimen. Very useful.\r\n"
