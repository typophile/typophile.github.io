  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Evening all -  <BR> <BR>I was hoping I could tap this board&#39;s divine wisdom for a moment and receive a little feedback / advice on an a4 leaflet I have designed. I&#39;m wanting the typography to be absoloutely water tight, and as one who&#39;s very much still learning his trade, a few words from those more experienced than I would prove invaluable.  <BR> <BR>The main typeface used is Adobe Warnock and I have used Interstate for the brief note on the back page. I&#39;m not convinved Interstate is the best choice - but with a limited number of fonts on my system, I think it&#39;s the best I can do. Suggestions of others to use still appreciated. Oh yes... there&#39;s also a Caslon fleuron on the front. <BR> <BR>Thank you all kindly <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><!--attachment: b2b_front-37483.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*158.4*Leaflet*b2b_front%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Leaflet<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/b2b_front-37483.pdf" target="_blank"><b>b2b_front.pdf</b></a> (158.4 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it looks quite sharp. Two things: first, pull up the sponsorships, since the &#34;Sponsored by O&#39;Keeffe Solicitors&#34; is too equidistant with the following lecture. Second, as for Interstate, while it does look OK, I think <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep?cview=S128765Q&amp;clist=SQ">Quadraat Sans</a> would be more in the style of Warnock, but I&#39;d use it only if you&#39;ve already got it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A few tiny points: <BR> <BR>1. I would lose the discretionary ligs. They give a slighly antiquarian, belle-lettristic impression. Asylum is too important &#40;and too &#34;modern&#34;&#41; a subject for that. You can probably keep the fleurons. <BR> <BR>2. Do you need the underlining. I hate underlining, and I would have thought the bold does the job well enough without. <BR> <BR>3. You have 4.00pm to 7:30pm &#40;ie full point in one time, colon in another&#41;. I think you should be consistent. <BR> <BR>4. Why are the dates in italic under the &#34;lectures&#34; heading on p.1? Why are the subtitles in italic but the lecture titles underlined in the brief details on p.2. Maybe there is a reason for this, but I can&#39;t see it immediately. <BR> <BR>5. Could you drop the bookings heading on p. 1 so that it aligned with venue and then use the full width of the textblock to give the dates and titles of the lectures. This is what people are really interested in. If they want to go to the lecture, they will search out the other information. But the subject of the lectures really needs to stand out. &#40;This I know because I&#39;m a lawyer and this is the kind of stuff we get all the time: what makes the difference is whether the topic of the lectures interests you.&#41; <BR> <BR>6. By the same token, I think there&#39;s too much prominence being given to the HJT Training mark, and not enough to the title. <BR> <BR>7. To my eye, page 1 is dropping below down the page. <BR> <BR>8. I quite like the interstate, but I think it is so small that it looks like legal &#34;small print&#34; . It needs to be bigger and less apologetic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Luke, I can see you&#39;re going the classic route, and have done a pretty good job of keeping it real. <BR> <BR>There are two things that jump out, as not being &#34;by the book&#34;. <BR> <BR>The first is, as Paul says, the underlining. It&#39;s not classic because you couldn&#39;t do it in metal -- in particular the way the underline passes through descenders is nasty. <BR> <BR>But I can see why you did it -- there is a complex hierarchy in the layout, you ran out of options, and the Warnock Bold does not appear sufficiently stronger than the Regular. But it is, and it should be, and if it&#39;s not, then the layout should be adjusted to give it enough prominence: try a little more space above the bold subheads. <BR> <BR>Secondly, the use of figures is inconsistent, mixing old style with lining. If you&#39;re going old-school, stick with the OSF everywhere, except in headings with all caps, where you should use roman numerals &#40;just kidding&#41;, I mean, cap height figures.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Luke, since you don&#39;t have too many numbers in Optima &#40;and you probably don&#39;t want to lay down the cash for Optima nova&#41;, and since there isn&#39;t anything to compare them with in the same document, you can &#34;fake&#34; old style figures &#40;I&#39;m assuming you use InDesign, but you can adapt this to any other system&#41;.  <BR> <BR><b>Warning: This may offend purists!</b> <BR> <BR>First, if your main text is 12pt, make the numbers 11pt. For 2 and 0, shrink the vertical scale to %77; for 3 and 4 shrink the vertical scale to %94, and drop the number 1.1pt below the baseline. Play around with it, and see what you think.</div>
