  Hoefler & Frere-Jones (http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100017).
  It is a real shame the face does not have non-lining figures...\r\n\r\nCheers[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mercury_4704.jpg]"

  body: I was also going to suggest Arnhem from OurType, it's used with great success
    by the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad (retail Arnhem for text, custom
    version for the headings). There is an article about it on [[http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=226|Yves'
    Fontshop blog]].

  body: "<cite> > As far as I know (and searched) it isn\u2019t available at the time.</cite>\r\n\r\nNot
    for retail license and online download. One would have to contact Cherie Cone
    directly and see what the availability is. I believe that Font Bureau is able
    to offer Fenway through their Studio Library, which is geared toward publications
    and requires a minimum number of licenses. Perhaps not practical for the original
    poster.\r\n\r\nPlus, Fenway has only hybrid numerals, which may or may not fit
    the OP's criteria. They're not strictly lining, but they're not oldstyle either,
    and some people find them too unusual as a result. (That was the case with the
    Georgia hybrid numerals, anyway, which is why later versions opted for more traditional
    oldstyle proportions.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ken>>> I didn't know font bureau was involved with Fenway. BTW... I forgot
    what the original posters issue with the numerals. :-)\r\n\r\nI have chatted with
    Cherie regarding Fenway before (currently on my list of must have Matthew Carter
    fonts) and it is very much available for license. After all, a Fenway specimen
    was included in the Indie Fonts book.\r\n\r\nIts true there isn't an online retail
    site. You would have go through Carter and Cone and inquire. Email or call.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.carterandcone.com/\r\n\r\nMikey
    :-)\r\n\r\nDoes Chronicle have those numeral options? Might be worth a gander."

  body: "Carter&Cone has been \"working on our website\" for like ten or more years.
    What better way to advertise the awesomeness of a brand than to have a website
    which more or less says \"we're too good for a website\".\r\n\r\nBack on topic,
    I liscenced BT Fleischman this year and really like it for larger sizes. It is
    one of the most pleasant-to-read faces I have used and its details are pleasantly
    outrageous. It is also a very good value. That being said, its long descenders
    and light colour make it ill-suited for use at small point sizes. As such couldn't
    really be considered an alternative to Mercury, despite their common roots. "
