    probably create the letters you want by adding the little spurs on the main strokes
    of ITC Quorum Black.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MILLERTIME_5483.jpg]"

    get some assistance from examining a vector version of the logo http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/miller-high-life-1\r\nAnother

    New/Underconsideration]] article on the 2010 rebranding of Miller High Life. New
    lettering was performed by Totonto-based famous lettering artist [[http://www.ianbrignell.com/miller-high-life-redesign|Ian
    Brignell]].\r\nSome more candidates for substitution: Boston Truckstyle, Posada,
    Flange, Beaufort, Silverado, Goudy Sans (probably my candidate for a customization),
    Memo, Triplett (almost perfect, my 2nd pick), Elan, Formata, Chipping, Symbol,
    Hensler 2, Modesto"
