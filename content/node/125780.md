  feeling of 1969 baseball. Kind of that gothic look, but still kind of trying to
  move into the future. \r\n\r\nAny idea what it is? I can get close, but then that
  capital S ruins it all because I can\u2019t find a match. It's so close to Blair,
  but....not quite.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve attached an image which contain the font from
  a few different cards. As you can see, they\u2019re outlined, but they don\u2019t
  need to be if I can find a similar font because I can either go as is or outline
  myself.\r\n\r\nThanks SOOOOOO much !"
