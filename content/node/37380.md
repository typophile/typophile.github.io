    well-honed design value and conceptual specifity.\r\n\r\nDefault oldstyle figures
    are nice for book and literary work and ads, and msot kinds of display typography,
    but lining figures have huge practical advantages if you're doing annual reports,
    point-of-sale literature, maps, instruction manuals and the like.\r\n\r\nOT features:
    built-in smallcaps are handy but with some OT fonts they're poorly kerned and
    it's easier using a separate smallcaps font. OT capitals spacing feature I find
    very useful if the font maker has established useful settings---it saves you time
    and tracking experiments.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "<em>How can you view the quality of the technical aspects James (P) lists
    without buying the font?</em>\r\n\r\nAn important question, and an issue I run
    into when buying fonts from some newer and/or independent foundries (many majors'
    draws of classics fall into this category too to be fair). The letterspacing is
    downright awful at times and I have had to track and kern the $hit out of some
    typefaces in order for them to at least look normal. I don't think there's any
    real way to know that until you take the plunge.\r\n\r\nI generally look for value,
    OT features, and usability of the face when I make purchases. Can I use this face
    more than once? How many options do I have to set text with it? I also like old
    style numerals so, I like looking for faces that have them as an OT feature.\r\n\r\nI
    gotta throw a thumbs up to Font Bureau for Interstate. The spacing on the family
    is the best of any sans-serif font I have ever used, period. It requires the least
    maintenance, and is beautifully drawn so it gets a lot of use from me.\r\n\r\nThe
    Thesis SuperFamily ain't too shabby either. Luc(as) knows fonts! They're both
    pricey as hell...but worth the dough. An example of quality being worth the price
    tag. Very versatile. I use the ever loving crap out of both families. :)"

  body: "James,\r\n\r\nI think first the designer has to decide which font he or she
    will be purchasing. It has to marry the job they are working on. Next, if you
    purchase a font, you want one that has been well made. What I mean by that is,
    the letters fit together like they should, there should be punctuation, numbers
    and incase it is a display typeface and not just a text face - then a few alternative
    letters would be nice.\r\n\r\nThen a font that will be able to work with your
    computer's system - and to the printer you send it out to, if you are having the
    job printed. (I'm on a MAC - Mac Type 1 are stabile, .ttf can be trashed - and
    not all Pro or OT fonts are created equal.)\r\n\r\nThen you just need to know
    the font works for you. Best of luck to you on your first purchase.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    An what is really nice about owning the font - is if they change the way the fonts
    are produced, they normally replace the one you have with the new type. I can
    still remember my Mac Type 3 floppy disks going out the door and new Mac Type
    \"A\" fonts returning..."

    \u2013 proper shape, position and size (one of the most problematic glyphs in

    a good indicator the rest of the characters will be probably \u2013 but not always
    \u2013 acceptable)\r\n<li>kerning of accented letters (many type foundries somehow
    forget to kern accented letters, they probably don\u2019t know that in many European
    languages accented characters could appear next to each other \u2013 even four
    in a sequence \u201Ct\u0159\xED\u0161\u0165\u201D; several type foundries do kern
    accented letters but only with non accented letters)\r\n<li>proper kerning of
    letters <em>dcaron, tcaron</em> and <em>lcaron</em> (special attention is needed

    @, \xAE, \xA9,\xB6, \u2122, \u20AC, and $. The math symbols are the usually victims.
    I don't set anything needing the math symbols but if they're there, it's nice
    to see them native to the font. \r\n\r\nBut when you bomb the registered trademark,
