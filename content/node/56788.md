  body: "There is a lot of Gill Sans in it: f, s, d, p. c and e however seem to be
    from something like AvantGarde. A is too narrow, B is bad. It\u2019s all like
    some sort of sampling."

  body: The "g" may simply the way it looks in the lighter weight and the "e" may
    be an alternate. Unfortunately, I don't have a full sample of the lighter weight
    with which to verify either of these possibilities. The sample I do have is from
    the Solotype Catalog where it is listed as Embrionic 55, and showing only the
    characters in the name of the font.

  body: Interesting. I would say it was definitely based on or inspired by Embrionic.

  body: Say, YES, the sample you show is the one found on the YouWorkForThem website
    advertising the typeface. Is that where you got it from?
