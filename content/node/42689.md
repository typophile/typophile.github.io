  which I have designed for my own small company. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newlogo_4446.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  work as a pianist, and my repertoire is both classical music from the golden age
  of the piano in the late nineteenth century as well as evergreens from the Great
  American Songbook from the 30s and 40s. I have tried to design a somewhat oldfashioned,
  Art Deco-inspired logo which hopefully invokes the glamor and elegance af a bygone
  era. \r\n\r\nI am planning to use the logo on my website and in connection with
  letterheads and business cards. \r\n\r\nDo you feel the concept is working, and
  if not, do you have any suggestions...?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nLars Boye Jensen\r\nDenmark"

    not late nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n<em>in connection with letterheads and business

    sizes, or do you have a special small size logo for this particular requirements.
    Can you show it?\r\n\r\nt.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    your print applications:\r\n\r\n- What does it look like in greyscale and black
    & white?\r\n- What does it look like when it's very small?\r\n\r\nI would imagine
    that the piano part would get muddled and the gradients would make things mushy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    works for me, although the piano player is looking quite \u201Cmade with the bezier-tool\u201D
    to me.</cite>\r\nI see what you mean. However, the drawing of the pianist was
    actually scanned from an old piano advertisement...\r\n\r\n<cite>30s and 40s i
    follow you, but not late nineteenth century.</cite>\r\nYes, I agree. An Art Nouveau
    theme might be more appropriate for expressing a fin-de-siecle mood, but that
    wouldn't work with music by Gershwin, Rodgers, and Cole Porter, so I settled for
    a more Jazz Age-inspired flavor.\r\n\r\n<cite>Hmm, that could be a problem, you
    tried to print it out in small sizes, or do you have a special small size logo
    for this particular requirement. Can you show it?</cite>\r\nI have only drawn
    one version, and I am aware that the logo won't work in small sizes, e.g. smaller
    than 2 or 3 inches wide.\r\n\r\n<cite> What does it look like in greyscale and
    black & white? </cite>\r\nHere's a possible greyscale version:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newlogo_bw_3977.jpg]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nLars

  body: "I works fine as a logo, IMHO. \r\n\r\nTwo suggestions: Do you NEED the word
    'pianist' and do you NEED that actual pianist? I'd suggest a version with just
    the piano. I think that, alone, is enough to say 'pianist'."
