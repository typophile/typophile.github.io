  body: "Dear paul d hunt,\r\n\r\nSurely you are joking? Looking at the terminals,
    Galliard is clearly based on a different period in Robert Granjon's illustrious
    career. For shame! You owe Paul Barnes an apology! This is an original work in
    progress by Mr. Barnes, called Muriel, and he has thus far refused to allow me
    to license it from him, although he has cruelly teased me with PDF specimens from
    time to time. It is outstanding.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke"

    makest a mistake. ;^)\r\n\r\nPlus I agree with Paul that it definitely looks like
    a heartline version of ITC Gaillard Italic, down to the alternate lowercase 'g'
    that's included in the Carter & Cone version. Well spotted, Paul. :^)"

    up some of the confusion and some inaccuracies\r\n\r\nMatthew\u2019s Galliard
    of course is a revival of two typefaces cut by Robert Granjon; his Ascendonica
    Romaine and his Ascendonica Cursive. Both appear in the printing of Plantin, and
    in part in his folio specimen of 1585; both were cut in 1570/1. He would have
    known the type well through the research he carried out with Harry Carter, Mike
    Parker and Henrick Vervliet. In the middle part of the last century both were
    recast from matrices, and smoke proofs were obtained from punches and appeared
    in several journals, the last being I believe in Typography Papers 3, 1998. This
    only shows the italic in Vervliet\u2019s article on Granjon\u2019s italics, which
    is built on the pioneering research of AF Johnson in the early 1940s. Matthew\u2019s
    own article on Galliard \u2018Galliard: A Revival of Types of Robert Granjon\u2019
    that appeared in Visible Language in 1985, 19.1 explains his method and reason.\r\n\r\nLike
    Matthew before me, I have made a typeface that is a revival of these particular
    models. From original and facsimile source material at St Bride Library, I have
    made this hairline version (entitled Marian 1570), which is part of a series of
    revivals or interpretations of \u2018classic\u2019 faces; Garamond, Granjon, Van
    den Keere, Fleischmann, Fournier, Baskerville, Bodoni, Austin and Besley. Rightly
    or wrongly I have perhaps followed what I think is Granjons \u2018line\u2019 closer
    than Matthew. Though Galliard is a very accurate revival it differs in some details
    from the model; the lower case f, h, p, q and the proportions of ascender and
    descenders in the italic are obvious ones, which I have retained.\r\n\r\nThat
    I should choose this particular source is based not on the fact that Matthew has
    made Galliard, but I would think that both of us recognise that this roman and
    italic mark a change in the style of the \u2018Renaissance\u2019 style of roman
    and italic. Granjon\u2019s career is marked by three key italic styles; his Petit
    Parangon of 1554 (basis for Adobe Garamond), his Italique Cicero droite of 1565
    (his upright italic, of which both the Oxford University Press and the Plantin-Moretus
    have mats, and St Bride has in case) and this one; which Vervliet calls his \u2018brilliant
    \u201CBaroque\u201D italics\u2019. Vervliet describes a fourth style, which is
    his earliest, and he calls \u2018hesitant and experimental\u2019. Marian 1554
    and 1565 deal with the other two styles (matched with the romans of Claude Garamond
    as Plantin would have done).\r\n\r\nSo I think perhaps the title is misleading
    and doesn\u2019t give credit to Granjon; a truly astounding punch cutter and typedesign.
    Like Matthew I am standing on the shoulders of one of the giants; infact Marian
    is entirely standing on these shoulders. Marian 1570 like Galliard comes from
    the original inspiration. Marian 1570 is not derived from Galliard, just as Fenway,
    Mercury and Farnham all draw from Fleischmann not from DTL Fleischmann. The alternative
    lower case g is in the specimen of 1585 and various reproductions of the recast
    type, not just Matthew\u2019s creation in the 70s.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: thanks for the excellent background, Mr Barnes. and i will apologize for my
    poorly worded post above. i should have sited the similarity (as you have pointed
    out), and not implied that it was derived from Galliard. thanks for clearing all
    that up and giving us some history.
