body: "An interesting debate at work:\r\n\r\nDo you design a page on the established
  template (Header, body copy, pictures, key-lines, page numbers, etc.) and NOT worry
  about kerning the type at the moment since it will be translated(to our Italian
  market)? Then revisit type for our market later.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nDo you design
  a page on the established template and kern the type\u2014 asking the copy writers
  to add or subtract words, looking for rivers and widows, but causing the other offices
  to wait before translation. Your type is tasty and your job is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\nI'm
  in the boat of getting it right the first time, setting the example for quality
  to the other office. Plus why not send the .doc file to Italy for translation first?\r\n\r\nMy
  boss, however, wants to give them everything all at once, as long as the design
  elements are locked in, and we can tweak copy as the deadline gets closer. He likes
  to get things off his plate as quickly as possible."

  body: "Keep in mind that Italian text tends to be inherently longer that the corresponding
    English one. So it\u2019s a good thing to give the translators an idea of the
    space they will need to fit. But there\u2019s no need to \u201Ckern\u201D the
    text at this stage."

  body: I would save the typographic fine-tuning until after the text is translated,
    especially since widows, rivers etc. will change when it's translated anyway.

  body: "I think your boss needs to just understand a little bit more about how translation
    works. Designing for another language is difficult enough to begin with, let alone
    trying to work out the finer issues with the text. I'd give the translators your
    general template, and possibly some guidelines for where you'd like things to
    fit. If you have it set, you put a lot on the translators--their jobs are hard
    enough as is, let alone with the stress of trying to fit something into your exact
    parameters.\r\n\r\nRiccard0 also has a point: Italian text is going to look very
    different from the English text."

  body: "Concerning the actual translation:\r\n1) If you need a very good Italian
    translator let me know and I'll put you in touch. Plus she's in NYC which is more
    convenient (not least ideologically :-) than Italy.\r\n2) As Riccardo says Italian
    takes up more space on average (actually Italian isn't bad, it's that English
    is very compact) <em>plus</em> translation typically expands the text length too;
    so you're looking at around 15% more text. When I translated David Rault's Excoffon
    book* from French to English I tried very hard to be compact but I still ended
    up only slightly shorter (I mean even though English is more compact than French).\r\n\r\n*

  body: "<cite>it's that English is very compact</cite>\r\n\r\nDunno about Italian,
    but in my experience as English-Arabic translator, my Arabic translation usually
    takes 2/3 the English text when using monospaced fonts, and even less with proportional
    fonts, but it might be also related to the fact that Arabic orthography omits
    the short vowels from the body of the word."

  body: "Arabic is indeed extremely compact (and as far as I'm concerned dropping
    short vowels when they're obvious* is a great thing). BTW, a great reference for
    this stuff is Sadek & Zhukov's \"Typographia Polyglotta\" - although you shouldn't
    get me started about its concluding paragraphs...\r\n\r\n* And in a consonantal
    language family like Semitic they generally are.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I think part of the situation with Arabic is that its script itself is much
    more space-saving than English. It's much tighter than the Latin script as a whole.

  body: "It uses the vertical space much better, so needs less horizontal space (and
    in the process fits our retina's acuity better too). However for that reason it
    also looks small on the body; and in some contexts it's difficult to live with
    that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
