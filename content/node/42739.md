  amount about point, pica, cmyk - but nothing about CSS, Em. However, I need to know
  something more about this topic. But where should I start? \r\nMy question is: Are
  there any good webpages that explain the basics?\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "Hi Isa,\r\n\r\nthis might be a good starting point:\r\n<a href=\"http://webtypography.net/toc/\">The
    Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a>.\r\nA List Apart has a number
    of interesting <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/topics/design/typography/\">articles
    on web typography</a>, too.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to know is: everything
    is relative. Unlike with print, you don\u2019t know nothing; you can\u2019t be
    100% sure about the font(s), the size, the available space, the colours \u2026\r\nStill,
    it can be fun, it\u2019s just a different approach. I\u2019d say most of web design
    is typography.\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\n[edit] Ha, Claus, I\u2019m too slow for you."
