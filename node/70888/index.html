  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all - I&rsquo;ve got a mystery font that was used on a military plaque that was made between 1945 and 1976 (circumstantial evidence suggests the plaque was most likely made between 1945 and 1947).  It has a serif style that is similar to the fonts listed below:</p>
<p>Amplitude BRK
Combustion BRK
Combustion Plain BRK
Combustion II BRK
Combustion Wide BRK</p>
<p>&hellip;but the shapes of most of the letters and numbers don&rsquo;t match any of these.</p>
<p>I apologize in advance for the poor quality of the image - it&rsquo;s the best I could do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to identify this font for the longest time - everyone who&rsquo;s had a look so far has been stumped.  Thanks in advance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Since you found this type on a plaque, my guess is that it&rsquo;s something peculiar to an engraving machine manufacturer, such as Hermes. The closest precursor I could find was a face called <strong>Curved Egyptian</strong>, from the 1888 James Connor&rsquo;s Sons specimen book.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The &ldquo;HAMBURGEFONS&rdquo; sample suggests that this is a foundry sample, rather than anything from a military plaque. Are you sure you posted the image you intended?</p>
<p>Also what is the source of these BRK fonts? Are these from some font CD you have?</p>
<p>(BTW, the font design of &ldquo;Bryant Font Chopped&rdquo; looks rather crude, and not much like I would expect to see on a military plaque.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi - thanks for the responses.  The image I posted was something I pasted together in photoshop.  I figured those letters would be the ones that people might find most useful for identification.  The image I have of the mystery font portion of the plaque exceeds the width limit for posted images on this board, but I&rsquo;ll post the original from the plaque here, cut in two pieces.</p>
<p>The image itself is crude.  I once had a higher-resolution image of it, but lost that years ago.  I agree - the font itself doesn&rsquo;t look like what you&rsquo;d expect on a military plaque.  This plaque was made to commemorate sailors killed by a kamikaze attack, and my guess is that it was probably commissioned and paid for by the crew itself rather than the navy, hence the slightly informal appearance of it.</p>
<p>The plaque was lost when the ship was scrapped in the 70s, and the crewmembers have been trying to track it down in the years since.  I&rsquo;m trying to get a replica made for them, but can&rsquo;t just yet because I haven&rsquo;t been able to identify this font.</p>
<p>Funny, but I realized this request is kind of timely, with today being Memorial Day!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This looks like a late 19th century squared Tuscan style, if there was such a thing. I tried to look for squared fonts with, or without, serifs, that might be a starting point to re-create this look. A sans that seems to have approximately the right shapes is <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/stratum2/">Stratum 2</a>. By adding flattened V-shaped serifs to this you might get close.</p>
<p>Other fonts that had sort of this look were Kwersity, Railway Point, Valgal and Wyoming Pastad (all at MyFonts). They all had straight serifs, but those could be replaced.</p>
<p>Another sans that had the right &lsquo;skeleton&rsquo; was <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/serpentine-sans/">Serpentine Sans</a>, although it&rsquo;s not a monotone font.</p>
