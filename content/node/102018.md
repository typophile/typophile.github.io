body: "So I'm generally a print designer, but I'm rebranding a boutique that also
  wants a website done. When creating their brand standards, I want a consistent font
  for body text online and in print. I've found a font that appeals to both the client
  and myself called \"Roos.\" We're interested in purchasing the entire family (for
  $149) and we're give the option of OTF or Webfont version.\r\n\r\nI've never implemented
  a Webfont before, since I don't generally do web design (and we will be using a
  professional web developer to deal with development of the site.) I've been googling
  and googling, but I can't seem to find the answer anywhere. This company will need
  to use the font on the web as well as on print materials such as postcards, business
  cards, and lookbooks. Will we have to purchase both both the Webfont version and
  the OTF version to accomplish this? Or will we be able to use a Webfont file in
  Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign?"

    appropriate to purchase both desktop and webfont versions for what you're doing.

  body: ">>You can install webfonts on your machine.<<\r\n\r\nThis depends on what
    the company chooses to deliver as \"web fonts\". If you only get .eot and .woff
    files, you can't install them on your machine. Likewise, even if you get .ttf
    files, some companies manipulate the fonts so that they can't be installed on
    a computer. "

    before. Quite recently actually regarding an unrelated topic about webfont pirating
    and some distributors not protecting their product."

  body: "Web-fonts and Print-Fonts, in 99% of the cases, are pretty much the same
    thing just converted from OTF to TTF, Autohinted, and converted again and packed
    in other formats such as WOFF or EOT. They are sold under different licenses simply
    to collect more money, under a variety of different arguments (For example: it's
    a different kind of usage, they are uploaded to the web, etc, etc...). This will
    piss off a lot of people here, but it's the way it is.\r\n\r\nThere are a few
    notable exceptions, where web-fonts where specially designed/tailored for the
    web and have key differences compared to their print-version (bigger x-height,
    wider, open counters, loose spacing, less contrast, etc...) such as the Webtype
    RE series, H&FJ smart screen fonts, Typoteque Screen fonts, and some other smaller
    foundries such as Monokrom and Letters From Sweden. There may be others that I'm
    missing now, but so far very few. (It will be nice if someone can compile a list
    of \"Real web-fonts\" vs \"automated conversions\"). This are the \"Real webfonts\",
    and not just plain conventions.\r\n\r\nFontFont Screenfonts are also hand-hinted,
    but not optimized in x-height, counters, etc.... This ones can work well also.
    As they where hand-picked from their extensive library for already having such
    features in a way that look good in the web without adjustments needed.\r\n\r\nAt
    Google Webfonts you will find both kinds. Some are Print-fonts converted for web
    use, and some are specifically tailored for the web, such as: Open Sans, Source
    Sans, Merriweather, Domine, Libre Baskerville and a few more. You can also download
    those and use them for print (but they will not be optimal since they will look
    bigger than usual). They are all released under a 'Libre' license, so they can
    also be used for commercial projects.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Ross, I guess it's
    an automated (or maybe semi-automated) conversion. And since the ascenders and
    descenders are large, my guess is that it will look small on the web if used at
    standard text sizes. You will need to use it bigger on the web (from 18 to 22px
    or maybe more) in order to be readable. If that's not a problem for you, it will
    work fine. It's a very nice font."

  body: For a webfont, you'll want to see how it renders across different browsers/platforms/sizes.
    MyFonts used to have browser-screenshots, but they seem to have disappeared...
    there are [[http://www.fonts.com/font/canada-type/roos/roman/web-font#browser-preview|
    a few previews at fonts.com]], though they only seem to license webfonts by subscription.
    (BTW, Roos is [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T1244/roos|currently on sale
    at YouWorkForThem]].)
