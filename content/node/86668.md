  body: I think the italic versions of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/bodoni-egyptian-pro/light-ital/glyphs.html|Bodoni
    Egyptian Pro]] and [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames/viewfonts|Eames Century
    Modern]] are both super elegant, even more elegant than Mrs. Eaves, in my opinion.
    Certainly worth the investment!
