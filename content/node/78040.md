  \r\n\r\nCleveden was inspired by some lettering sighted on a neglected and somewhat
  tarnished brass plaque, affixed to an elderly office building.  The elegance and
  character (somehow playful and formal at the same time) of the letterforms shone
  through he tarnished state of the plaque.  As an aside the brass plaque in question
  was on the former business premises of a long established firm of accountants.  We
  suspect the ethics of that profession would preclude us identifying which one.  Our
  efforts to identify their engraver have proven unavailing.  Cleveden is a family
  of four typefaces, Regular, Bold, Capitals and Capitals Bold.  They are ideal for
  designs that call for distinctive formality and especially lend themselves to signage,
  certificates, and -dare it be said- engraved plaques!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cleveden_5834.png]\r\n\r\nFitzgerald
  was inspired by the carved and gilded lettering seen over the entrance of a bar
  in Dublin.  The result is a lovely piece of neo-Victorian fun that brings back the
  joy of 19th century shop-signs and flamboyant design ethos.  Fitzgerald is ideal
  for poster work and signage, or anywhere that you want to bring back the joy of
  high Victorian design ethos.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fitzgerald_5233.png]\r\n\r\n"
