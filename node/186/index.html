<div class=commentbody> ??I would bring with me to a deserted island <br> <br>1. Gill Sans <br>For its timeless uniqueness and likeability <br> <br>2. Linotype Frutiger Condensed <br>For its 100% clarity. Perfect for signage. <br> <br>3. Verdana <br>I need a good font for my browser -- and we were allowed to bring our G4, remember? <br> <br>4. Linotype Univers Condensed <br>I may be the sole inhabitant on the island, but sooner or later I will have the need to publish a catalogue or a list. Univers Condensed will come in handy. <br> <br>5. PMN Caecilia <br>At the moment I can't stand the sight of it. But this typeface is *so good* that I simply must bring it. <br> <br>6. Lexicon <br>I have never used this font. I have never owned it. By choosing it to this forum I hope that some yuletime-spirited guy at Ensched&#233; will *give* it to me. In return I shall study it closely. <br> <br>7. Tate Gallery Corporate Typeface (Wolff Olins) <br>God, it's beautiful! Recently I asked about it in Typophile Forum Type Identification Board. One of you guys said it resembled both VAG and DIN. <br> <br>8. Minion <br>As good a text face as any when treated right. <br> <br>9. ITC Bodoni <br>I guess I can't do without a good Bodoni. <br> <br>10. Parisine <br>I greatly admire the work of JFP! </div>

<div class=commentbody>MY FAVORITE FACES from the PAST TEN YEARS. <br>My list is influenced by a background in magazine and t-shirt design, and an affinity for display work. I could not settle on an order for these ten. <br> <br>bj <br> <br> <br>Anisette by Porchez <br> <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/specimens/anisette.html target=_top>http://www.fontbureau.com/specimens/anisette.html</a> <br><a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/Alphabets/Anisette.html target=_top>http://www.typofonderie.com/Alphabets/Anisette.html</a> <br>Art Deco Beauty. <br> <br>Biblon by Storm <br><a href=http://www.stormtype.com/htm/bibl.html target=_top>http://www.stormtype.com/htm/bibl.html</a> <br>So much to love, especially the inconsistencies that he manages to keep consistent and the feeling that the letters were 'inked' by a hand-letterer. Download a pdf. <br> <br>Hoefler Fetish No. 338 by Hoefler <br><a href=http://www.typography.com/catalog/fetish338/index.html target=_top>http://www.typography.com/catalog/fetish338/index.html</a> <br>I can look at this all day. Type candy. <br> <br>The Royal Family by Giasson <br><a href=http://www.THIRSTYPE.COM/font_royalfamily.html target=_top>http://www.THIRSTYPE.COM/font_royalfamily.html</a> <br>A ingenious mix of DIN and fraktur, the Royal Family is another well-executed Thirstype face. On the job when a particular mall-based chain of goth music stores needs a T-shirt design. <br> <br>Radio by Rakeng <br><a href=http://www.THIRSTYPE.COM/font_radio.html target=_top>http://www.THIRSTYPE.COM/font_radio.html</a> <br>Was there ever a face worth waiting for, what was it, three years? <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>Poetica by Slimbach <br><a href=http://www.adobe.com:80/type/typedesign/slimbach.html target=_top>http://www.adobe.com:80/type/typedesign/slimbach.html</a> <br>Not just another swashbuckling chancery face, Poetica rises above because of its completeness and attention to detail. The alternates and ligatures and ornaments...so much beautiful stuff. <br> <br>Zapfino by Zapf <br><a href=http://www.fontexplorer.com/FontStore/ target=_top>http://www.fontexplorer.com/FontStore/</a> <br>Linotype says it better than I can: "A masterpiece from the master himself." What they really meant was: Typorgasm. <br> <br>The Shire Types by Tankard <br><a href=http://www.TYPOGRAPHY.NET/ target=_top>http://www.TYPOGRAPHY.NET/</a> <br>A classic in the making. Would love to see these carved out of...coal and hold them in my hands. Would love to see this used more here in the States. I love the fixed height for both uppers and lowers, and the variations. <br> <br>Sauerkrauto by Core <br><a href="http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5267" target=_top>http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5267</a> <br>Lettering based on Germany's license plates? You'd think this was a throwaway font, but such care has been placed on getting it perfect. On the cover of WIRED last month. <br> <br>Mantinia by Carter <br><a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/specimens/mantinia.html target=_top>http://www.fontbureau.com/specimens/mantinia.html</a> <br>I love the mix of points and curves. Also, the lovely descenders on the 'Q' and 'R' are songs of the siren. <br> <br>Faces from the past decade regrettably not included: <br> <br>Oz by Chester (thirstype.com) <br>SuperDuper by Rakeng (thirstype.com) <br>**((Alchemy by Tankard (typography.net) Mason by Barnbrook (emigre.com), Idiosynoptium by Griek (www.plusism.u-net.com)))** <br>most anything by Storm (stormtype.com) <br>most anything by Rian Hughes <br>anything by Rodrigo Cavazos (psyops.com) <br>faces by Jim Parkinson, Jim Marcus and Chank Diesel</div>

<div class=commentbody>Partly because it's so hard to narrow the list down to 10, this list isn't exactly my top 10 *individual* favorites, it's more like the 10 faces that come together to paint my favorite picture. <br> <br>1. Centaur (Jenson, Rogers) - First real font. <br> <br>2. Galliard (Granjon, Carter) - One giant on another's shoulders. <br> <br>3. Perpetua (Gill) - The pure essence of Latin. <br> <br>4.

<div class=commentbody>I divided my list into my top ten favorite TEXT faces, and my top ten favorite DISPLAY faces, as comparing between the two seemed unrealistic. Even this distinction is subjective, admittedly, as fonts from one category could easily fit into the other (and, in fact, a few are listed in both). <br> <br>These lists reflect the way I use the fonts most of the time, and they reflect my thinking as of today. If we were to post this list again in a week, it's likely that my selections would be slightly different. I surprised myself with the excellent fonts that I considered (and use quite often), but DIDN'T include, among them: Akzidenz Grotesk, Baskerville, Bodoni, Caslon (Adobe, Berthold, or Caslon 540), Centaur, Century, Cochin, Franklin Gothic, Galliard, Helvetica Neue, Italian Old Style, Kabel (not ITC's), Officina, Meta, Syntax, Triplex and Walbaum. <br> <br>I also refrained from including my own designs in this list. <br> <br> <br>TOP TEN FAVORITE TEXT FACES: <br> <br>#10: BOOKMAN / OLD STYLE (Ludlow, 1925; Merganthaler-Linotype, 1936; Agfa-Monotype ?) <br> (No direct link available; search at fonts.com) <br> <br>AGFA-Monotype has the best version that I've found; Bitstream's is okay. Avoid ITC's parody. <br> <br> #9: PLANTIN (Agfa-Monotype </div>

<div class=commentbody>Whoops. It was pointed out to me quite correctly that I neglected to credit the US Federal Highway Administration for the design of the FHWA Series fonts, which are the standard typefaces used for highway signs in the US, and the inspiration for my #10 display face choice, Interstate. <br> <br>I haven't yet been able to track down the name(s) of the designer(s) of the FHWA Series, nor its design date. <br> <br>I believe the following information may have been posted elsewhere on the Typophile Forums, but I can't recall where. It's fairly interesting stuff nonetheless. According to Richard C. Moeur's website (<a href=http://members.aol.com/rcmoeur/alphabet.html target=_top>http://members.aol.com/rcmoeur/alphabet.html</a>): <br> <br>"The standard typefaces used for highway signs in the US are defined in the 'Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs', published by the Federal Highway Administration." <br> <br>Apologies for the omission. <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody> I would participate, but I only noticed this thread had begun 3 days ago, and I'm too busy right now to devote any time to make a contribution. Besides, I don't see why there had to be such a strict and early deadline, not to mention the fact that this isn't exactly the best time of year for widespread participation in something like this. The new year would have been better. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Not to fret, not to worry. Add to the list whenever you get a chance, this year, next year. The thread never ends. There is no strict deadline. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>>> The reason for the 'deadline' seemed obvious, but I guess not because we went from 'greatest' faces to 'favorite' faces. If you are posting a 'greatest' list, then you want lists that are not influenced by others, thus everyone posts at a certain time. Favorites, it doesn't really matter. So by all means post, this year, next year, whenever. As you can see, the 'strict' deadline was not a deadline at all. (By the way, the first post was made on Dec. 6.) Personally, I'm learning a lot about type, getting exposure to great opinions and having, uh, fun. I don't see a reason to be sore. <br> <br>>> I was going to make a couple of suggestions to enrich the Typophile community. If you 'interract remotely' then every time there is a post at Typophile, it sends a copy to your email address. If you do not choose this option, and want to see what's going on since you last visited, click on 'Search_Last Day, or _Last Week or _Last Visit." <br> <br>bj </div>

<div class=commentbody> Sorry to be a curmudgeon here (and I still don't have time to contribute my own ten favorites) but if you're going to post a list here, then shouldn't you include links so we can all see examples of the fonts in your lists? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi all, <br>do you the book *emotional digital*? If not, it is a book in which a lot of different typefoundries are being presented. On top of that, they put a list online with links of the presented foundries: <a href=http://www.emodigi.de/ target=_top>http://www.emodigi.de/</a> <br> <br>Following typefaces should not be forgotten either: <br> <br>TEFF Renard (The Italic is just it!!!) <br>Trump Medi&#230;val <br>Joanna <br>DTL Fleischmann <br> <br> <br>Jacques</div>

<div class=commentbody> Is there somebody who or someplace that sells quality used typefaces like these - not the "300 on a CD" cheapo sets? Sorry, but the orignal prices @ Adobe, Bitstream etc. are just too dang expensive for the likes of me! </div>

<div class=commentbody> "Used"?! Like with a few "1" bits eroded to zeros with wear and tear?... <br> <br>Seriously: some font prices can seem too high to some people - and no matter what certain type designers might tell you, it's not your fault. <br> <br>hhp </div>
