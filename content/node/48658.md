body: "Here's a thing that I've been wondering (and needing) for a long time:\r\n\r\n-
  Some vector drawing applications like Illustrator or CorelDraw have a stroke feature,
  where you draw a line and can specify a width to it, even with calligraphic simulation.
  Fontlab hasn't. I know it has Expand Stroke thing, but in many, many cases I have
  the need to undo what I've done, change what I need and do it again. And it works
  nasty, sometimes.\r\n\r\nSo, my suggestion is: please develop a macro (or a tool)
  that can give the expand stroke without removing the inital line and that changes
  when we change the line.\r\n\r\nThis seems essencial when working with different
  weights, even for italics.\r\n\r\nIt would be a lovely and practical way of seeing
  Gerrit Noordzij's theories applied.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, guys?"

  body: "Yes, but not quite. :)\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a spine and fill it with
    the amount of muscle needed.\r\n\r\nIt's like developing a font with the Expand
    Strokes feature with the difference that you don't need to undo to tune the stroke
    path.\r\n\r\nThanks, Miguel."
