  working on a interface design which have to use this typeface I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nAnd
  I've been handed some screens from the device (see the attachments)\r\nI've already
  tried whatthefont.com without any luck.\r\n\r\nAs you may see this face is very
  close to Meta but it has few differences on the lowercase a, i and B.\r\nThere is
  also the chance that this is a exclusive custom typeface used by this client.\r\n\r\nAny
  help appreciated, thanks in advance.\r\n"
