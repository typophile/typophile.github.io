  body: "Thanks Fivos for the extensive index of pirates and possible independent
    digitizers.\r\nMost of the pirates are obvious, e.g. Southern and SSK. \r\nThere
    may have been more than one original digitization. It would take some checking
    to determine if the fonts seem to have a common digital source. This is compounded
    by the fact that the font was probably originally in ps format and converted to
    ttf, with varying degrees of accuracy, and some of the fonts have been tinkered
    with for various reasons. From the Horton reference it could perhaps originally
    have been a Mac font. Preliminary digging is not conclusive.\r\nOne of the candidates
    for being an individual source is WSI. See Luc Devroye http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-25319.html\r\nDon"

  body: The original was called MacHumaine by Bill Horton, 1989 or 1990. He put it
    in the public domain. It was a very badly made font technically and, in 1993,
    Doug Miles updated it. I don't know if it was then or later that it got the name
    Alpine. It was obvious why folks preferred the "improved" versions over the original,
    though - it was simply more usable.

  body: "<a href='http://www.erik.co.uk/font/' target='_blank'>Here</a> is a website
    that has been around for many years and never changed. It offers those early-digital
    freeware/shareware Mac fonts along with documentation. If you go to the Serif
    section, you'll find a version of the font called Heidelberg (explains some ripoff
    naming, eh?) by Bill Horton.\r\n\r\nI no longer have the software installed to

  body: "Thanks Mike. I also have lost the ability to convert these old Mac files..\r\nSo
    I take it that the most probable original name is MacHumaine, which for some reason
    did not make Fivos' original list. For PC users we look for the version with the
    info \"created by Bill Horton 1990; updated by Doug Miles 1993?\"\r\nSo how did
    Bill Horton create it. Fortunately the copy I found included a text file:\r\n---start
    quote---\r\nJanuary 1989\r\nA few years back, I created a bitmapped font using
    FONTASTIC, originally called Philo, and after some alterations, Fancy Chancery.
    It was unique mainly for its removal of dots where  smooth curves would not be
    permitted, thus giving an overall appearance of gray. The font actually prints
    quite cleanly (particularly at 12 point) on the Imagewriter and was only a 24
    pt. bitmap initially. \r\n\r\nI am pleased to learn that the font has shown up
    in numerous places with several different names and variations, from Fluent Fonts
    of CasadyWare (Casady Greene) (with my permission) to bulletin boards here and
    there. Most recently I received from Doug Miles in Washington state a newly done
    bitmap in a heavier weight plus a postscript font executed by Marion Delahan in
    Oklahoma based upon the same font. \r\n\r\nCoincidentally, I recently started
    redrawing the original Fancy Chancery on Fontographer for Laserwriter. When I
    received the Delahan version I decided on a complete redrawing and renaming of
    the postscript font. The result is MacHumaine. \r\n\r\nThere have been inquiries
    as to how I intend to distribute MacHumaine. I wish it to remain in the public
    domain to be used by anyone who wants to take the time to copy it. Additionally,
    the package contains the original Fontographer workfile as well as the AFM file
    so anyone who wishes to alter or improve it, may do so if they have Fontographer.
    The bitmaps are absolutely pure FONTOGRAPHER generated with no tweaking. For my
    own purposes this is satisfactory, however if you would like to see them cleaner,
    have at it with Fontastic. I would not be extremely happy to learn that MacHumaine
    is being sold, but I am not quite sure how that eventuality would be dealt with.
    Hopefully this Read Me, which accompanies the font, will make folks realize they
    need not buy it as it is available without charge. Anyone who wishes to use MacHumaine
    as a screen display in a commercial program or in conjunction with a commercial
    program has my permission to do so. Only outright sale of the font is discouraged.\r\n\r\nHistorically,
    the font MacHumaine, as its name is intended to imply, is based on calligraphic
    handwriting and is not too distant from Zapf Chancery Black. That font, drawn
    by Hermann Zapf, was not the model for MacHumaine, but Zapf also used chancery
    cursive handwriting as a the basis for his font. MacHumaine is a sort of pot pourri
    of calligraphic strokes and flourishes that, to my eye, seem to be pretty well
    integrated and, especially when italicized on the Mac, gives an appearance of
    italic handwriting. I do hope you enjoy it. Oddly, it prints quite well even at
    small sizes and is quite readable. Please do not use it ALL CAPS. Generally calligraphic
    styles do not lend themselves to this treatment and this one is no exception.
    Use key caps to check for a few added characters. Any comments or suggestions
    on the font are welcome.\r\n\r\nBill Horton\r\n1205 De la Vina Street\r\nSanta
    Barbara CA 93101\r\n(805) 962-3964\r\n---end quote---\r\nSo we seem to have a
    license that authorizes use of this version of the font.\r\nDL link:\r\nhttp://www.abstractfonts.com/font/2571\r\nDon"
