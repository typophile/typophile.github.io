  body: "I can think of 2 serif fonts with E's like this: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/eplica/|Eplica]]
    and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/psyops/aquamarine_smallercaps_roman_ligatures/|Aquamarine]].
    (I think Aquamarine has alternate letters that may match the A better.)\r\n\r\nSome
    other fonts, like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/cg_hollandse_mediaeval_signature_virtual/|Hollandse
    Mediaeval]], might match the other letters better.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
