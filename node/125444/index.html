  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello! 

New here, but I would appreciate the help! I have been searching for this font for a while now. I have two brides that both have fallen in love with the look of this font (I suspect what they really like are specifically the characters with the long swashes) and would love to find it since it's been requested twice now. It features an uneven baseline and long swashes, particularly downward swashes on characters used at the beginning of the word and then upwards on the ends of the words. It looks like there'd be a lot of ways to style this font. 

I've found it used in a few places, mostly in a particular Etsy shop.  However they do not list what font it is. They do list that they "spent many hours sourcing the right font", so I don't believe it's exclusive to them alone, and should be available somewhere ( I recognize carolyna pro black used on a few of their other invites so I highly doubt it's exclusive to them). I have also seen it used in a tiny graphic for a completely unrelated food site, so it should be out there somewhere. But so far no luck! I've tried breaking apart the characters a bit to use in font identifiers and such and still no luck. I've reverse google image searched as well just to see if anything might pop up that I could dig through, again not much comes up. It also drives me nuts because I feel like I've stumbled across this font before and neglected to buy it at the time (I'm still combing through the sites I hop on most frequently and still hasn't come up).  

I feel like I have some fonts already that are similar, but it's those swashes that are really making it hard to please these two. That combined with the uneven baseline of these characters is making it a difficult find! Any and all help is greatly appreciated! 

Thanks for your time! </div>
