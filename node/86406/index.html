  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greeings All,

Trying to understand the OT kern feature as well as trying to pick up some glyphs from a client's existing OTF.

Opening a few existing OTFs in FontLab (5.0.4) things seem to make sense, they use the pos command with pairs of characters. The clients font, however, has only this in the kern feature:

<code>feature kern { # Kerning
 # Latin
lookup kern1 {
} kern1;
 language FRA ; # French
 language ITA ; # Italian
 language AZE ; # Azeri
 language TRK ; # Turkish
 language MOL ; # Moldavian
 language ROM ; # Romanian
 language CRT ; # Crimean Tatar
 language DEU ; # German
 script DFLT; # Default
lookup kern1;
 script grek; # Greek
lookup kern1;
 script cyrl; # Cyrillic
lookup kern1;
 language SRB ; # Serbian
} kern;</code>

I can recreate any necessary kerning for the few glyphs I need to pick up, but I'd like to understand things better.

I can see there is kerning in the font by setting in InDesign and changing from "Metrics" to 0 so I'm thinking that FontLab may just be reading the OTF incorrectly?

I've tried using Kerning assistance to expand and/or compress both of which mark all the glyphs as if they've been changed, but then upading the kern feature I get only:

<code>feature kern {
} kern;</code>

Any enlightenment would be most appreciated.

All Best,
Ken</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tried saving the features from FontLab but in the feature file I only got the code I put in my first post.

In FontLab when I try to generate the font with which I'm working and the Arno from FontLab it indicates that there are binary tables, so I'm guessing it just wasn't able decompile it in to the feature.

I looked quickly last night for a compiled PC version of FontForge but didn't see one, maybe I'll try that again.

I'm still not real familiar with the features so bear with me. Based on this info from Michel I'm assuming its the gpos commands I'm looking for? I'll also have to figure out how to isolate the information relating to just the glyphs I need to pick up.

Oy.

		<div class="commentbody">Contextual kerning?!?! Oy-vey! All this is pretty cool stuff but doing this as a side function of my main job responsibilities is really making me long for the days of 256 characters and kern pairs that are just that, simply pairs! :o)

I've since done some searches and found other threads, here and elsewhere, that talk about Arno and it's kerning, a couple of which confirm my suspicion that the kerning is just too complex for FontLab to decompile.

Looking at these other font editing programs really make me appreciate the way FontLab works with the features, making them easy to read and understand.

Probably a silly question but how'd you come to the conclusion that Arno has contextual kerning? And would ALL of the kerning contextual?

Thanks for chiming in Charles!

		<div class="commentbody">From the screenshots of Arno above, those are kerning classes not contextual kerning. Kerning by classes can be very compact (and may be more efficient) when you have lots of similar glyphs that kern identically; 10 A-like glyphs and 10 V-like glyphs, that is 10×10 kerning pairs to edit, but only one pair of kerning classes. I find FontForge's UI for kerning classes very informative and makes editing and reviewing kerning classes as simple as it goes.</div>

In OTM one can do this by selecting the <em>Export…</em> option from the <em>File</em> menu, but actually the emphasis in my line was on the second part: ‘<em>[…] and (after editing) compile the features again […]</em>’
&nbsp;
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Features_2_6424.jpg]
OTM cleverly compiles features without the necessity that the imported layout features are covered by the character set. It will ‘simply’ generate a subset of the applicable features (and shows this in a listing). At DTL we use a sort of ‘all covering’ <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/features_2.1_New_OTM.fea"> features ﬁle</a>, which I update and enhance from time to time. 
&nbsp;
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Features_3_4395.jpg]
By the way, exported features <em>may</em> be edited, but also can be compiled again without doing that, generating things as they were.

Well, FontForge can also read in the feature file.  You just select <code>File &gt; Merge Feature Info</code> and then select the .fea file. Here I deleted completely the GPOS tables from Arno, and read in the feature file. Some names are lost but the tables are there.

Edit. 

Ok, now I generated the otf font, exited from FontForge and opened FontForge on the new font. Here is what I now see in the GPOS tables:

With the risk of this turning into this does and that does :) but FontForge does that too; it will simply ignore glyph names that does not exist in the font, though it won't generate a warning which is suboptimal. FontForge also implements all of the feature file specification, even parts not implemented by Adobe (in the other day I wanted to test some of my feature files with AFDKO and it started complaining about certain lookup types not supported and I couldn't get it to compile at all without re-implementing those lookups in more convoluted ways).</div>

lookup names are purely cosmetic, they don't get output in the final font (unless you ask FontForge to output its private table where it can keep such information for later use). When FontForge opens a new font it will generate lookup names based on the feature they are attached to. Feature files have restrictions on table names, so the ones exported by FontForge differ slightly from the ones used originally in the UI.</div>

&nbsp;
Basically that is the point of discussion now, but before I further elaborate on the differences in functionality between FF and OTM, let me underline here that I consider FF to be a very powerful and highly useful program for professional font production. The by designers often discussed X Windows interface of FF is probably not the most sophisticated one, but with scripting much can be done in FF without having to look at the interface anyway. And with some tweaking the FF auto-hinter is one of the best I have seen so far. So, although I prefer (not surprisingly) DTL FontMaster, FontForge is a serious competitor in my opinion.
&nbsp;
That being said, although there is obviously an overlap in functionality, there is a big difference between FF and OTM when it comes to editing OpenType fonts and OT layout features. Prior to editing, the FF user has to convert a font to FF’s proprietary format and after editing the font has to be newly generated again. The outcome (besides the changes) will never be identical to the original font, unless this was generated with the same version of FF too, I reckon. 
&nbsp;
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_FV_TTF_3839.jpg]
With OTM the font is not converted and one can edit the character set, glyphs and tables directly, i.e. the font itself becomes the ‘database’. OTM runs natively under Mac OS and Windows and the latter makes side by side editing with for instance MS’s Font Validator easy (see the illustration above). 
&nbsp;
With the upcoming <em>KernMaster 2012</em> we will focus even more on the font-as-database approach; KM 2012 can space and kern OT fonts and merges the outcomes with the original font data. Output options include a features ﬁle, of course.

This exchange of info on the checking and editing of OT Layout features seems to go in all directions now, but I simply can’t resist replying here that the 30+ years old IKARUS (UNIX) ﬁle system of which DTL FontMaster makes use, is also very much text based (UFM [URW Font Metadata], CHA [character layout ﬁle] and kerning [.afm or .fea]).

I have tried to explain FM’s versatile ﬁle structure in <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/FM/FM_Easy_automation.pdf"> this presentation</a> a couple of years ago.

&nbsp;
Yes, that is what I meant. The proprietary format of the IKARUS system has been publicly documented too (as far as I know, for the ﬁrst time in the late 1980’s). 
I did not know that FontForge does support the IK format and so far I have not been able to open IK ﬁles in FF, by the way. I know that FontLab Studio supports the IK format in a limited way. Although it is quite some time ago when I tested this, I was able to open some IK ﬁles in FLS.
&nbsp;
James: ‘<em>[…] expecting the feature labeled “'kern' table viewer” in a program […] to show me OpenType kerning.</em>’
&nbsp;
As you know, OpenType fonts come in two ﬂavors (CFF and TTF) and there are two ways to include kerning into OpenType fonts, namely as ‘ﬂat’ kerning in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/kern.htm">‘kern’ table</a> (only in TTF) and as ‘advanced’ kerning in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gpos.htm">‘GPOS’ table</a> (TTF’s can contain both tables). You probably meant the ‘GPOS’ table when you mentioned ‘OpenType kerning’, I reckon.

Even then, FontForge can be useful. Last summer, I made a font with AAT tables for the Macintosh. I found no way to get with fontforge a ttf output that would work correctly on OS X 10.5, so I used the fontforge python module to generate the appropriate mif file (6770 lines) and then used ftxenhancer. All the precomposed glyphs had been generated with a fontforge script. However,  after seeing some outputs on the screen, I realized that some diacritics in the precomposed glyphs needed to be moved. Modifying the font  with fontforge and generating anew did not work and ftxenhancer was much too slow for my taste. So, here is what I did: I opened the working AAT font with FontForge, reencoded in the glyph order, modified the glyphs to my taste, generated a new ttf font and then extracted from it the glyf table using ttx and merged the resulting .ttx file into the original AAT font. That worked nicely, and fast. So, with fontforge and ttx, you can do things with fonts that fontforge does not understand completely.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow! I LOVE this forum! Thanks guys.

I had to call in a 2nd team who was able to give me a GPOS (I'm pretty sure that was what I needed) "dump" though I'm not sure from where (I have an email to him). I took that and, from my limited knowledge, am thinking (as Khaled mentioned) it looks like it is all kerning classes. I've crunched that file and picked from it what I needed creating classes as necessary. I know have a boat load of kern pairs to add to the font and classes to work with them.

However (there's always a but) when I import into FontLab its not indicating the same number of pairs I know I have. In another post (http://typophile.com/node/40041) Adam T. mentions 10,920, though I'm not sure whether than means pairs OT class or "old-style" pairs. I'm trying to import the single and key-glyph pairs I've created, and total I should have no where near 10,920. I've looked but can't seem to find anything definitive as to what the limit for the "regular" (not the OT feature) kern pair limit it. Does anyone know?

Also, at the top of the dump I received there is a lookup containing 505 glyphs that looks like this and I have no idea what they are:

<code>lookup GPOS_LOOKUP_00000 
{
 lookupflag 0;
    pos \A <5 0 10 0>;
    pos \B <5 0 10 0>;
    pos \C <5 0 10 0>;
    pos \D <5 0 10 0>;
    pos \E <5 0 10 0>;
    ...</code>

Below that are kern pairs of some sort?:

<code>lookup GPOS_LOOKUP_00001 
{
 lookupflag 0;
    pos question uni0458 <0 0 4 0>;
    pos question uni0463 <0 0 3 0>;
    pos B X <0 0 -6 0>;
    pos B b <0 0 -11 0>;
    pos B v <0 0 -14 0>;
    ...</code>

Below that are entries that look like this, which I am assuming is the class kerning (these don't seem to repeat what I think are kern paris up above):

<code> subtable;
    pos [ \A \Aacute \Acircumflex \Adieresis \Agrave \Aring \Atilde \R_A \K_A \uni0102 \uni0100
         \uni0104 \uni01FA \uni1EA0 \uni1EA2 \uni1EA4 \uni1EA6 \uni1EA8 \uni1EAA \uni1EAC
         \uni1EAE \uni1EB0 \uni1EB2 \uni1EB4 \uni1EB6]
        [ \A \AE \Aacute \Acircumflex \Adieresis \Agrave \Aring \Atilde \uni0102 \uni0100 \uni0104
         \uni01FA \uni01FC \uni1EA0 \uni1EA2 \uni1EA4 \uni1EA6 \uni1EA8 \uni1EAA \uni1EAC
         \uni1EAE \uni1EB0 \uni1EB2 \uni1EB4 \uni1EB6] <0 0 29 0>;</code>

Am I correct in my assumptions and what is that first thing?

Oy, and thnks again for everyone's time.

<PRE>
spot -t GPOS=6 ArnoPro-Regular.otf > ArnoPro-Regular.afm

you can get a huge file in afm format containing all kerning pairs for all the scripts (it takes a few minutes). The first lines are

Comment Begin Script DFLT Language dflt

There are thus 997900 pairs which, after converting to GPOS pair kerning, overflows by a few hundred times the maximum allowed. 

In particular, in subtable 2, the left class number 34 contains 330 characters and the right class number 26 contains 254 characters; by specifying that the kern of each left character in class number 34 with each right character in class number 26 is -4 (which gives just one pair with class kerning), 330 × 254 = 83820 pairs are required in the afm file: that single pair would already cause an overflow with pair kerning.
