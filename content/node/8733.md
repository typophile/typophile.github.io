body: Aren&#39;t we visual communicators?  <BR> <BR>If we take the definition of artist,
  &#34;a person whose creative work shows sensitivity and imagination&#34;, then yes
  I would say I&#39;m an artist. But isn&#39;t it kind of loaded to use the term artist?
  Should communication come before art? I suppose you could say &#34;communications
  artist&#34; but that sounds loaded too. I would think that &#34;sensitivity and
  imagination&#34; is assumed of all people that are creative and part of the problem,
  err I mean reason, of why they persued a career in the creative world. I suppose
  this is my knee-jerk reaction to someone who says, &#34;noooo, I am an artiste!&#34;

  body: didn&#39;t you answer your own question with the question itself?  if you&#39;re
    a designer, why call yourself anything else? i think that the term designer captures
    the meaning of &#34;problem solver&#34; better than artist does without losing
    the notion of creativity and imagination. <BR> <BR>but then again... words are
    just words and really have no other meaning than what we attach to them, so you
    could call yourself anything you wanted and &#40;to you&#41; it will mean precicely
    what you want it to mean. &#40;sorry had to get my decon theories in there&#41;

    is often a very bogus term, since much of what graphic designers do is not communicative
    at all; it is at most evocative and even then tends toward the hopeful rather
    than the proveable: one hopes that the choice of colour and arrangement of elements
    <i>suggests</i> something to the viewer that will evoke the desired response.
    This is not communication. Communication is the transfer of an <i>idea</i> from
    one mind to another, measurable by the accuracy of the transmission. Despite the
    barrage of visual imagery in our society, the vast majority of communication is
    still linguistic, either verbal or literary. The only true &#39;visual communicators&#39;
    are people who work with information design systems, which codify mental concepts
    using symbolic equivalents.'

    an artist or totally anything. That said, it&#39;s highly useful -and necessary-
    to consider <i>concepts</i> as being pure. For example pure Art is when you create
    something motivated only by the need to express yourself - which of course never
    actually happens. But there is some Art in any act of design. The key thing though
    is that -for the act to cross a certain threshold into Design- this need to express
    has to be an unintended, or at least an undirected, force, emanating inescapably
    from your human-ness, sort of <i>in spite</i> of yourself. For example, if you
    make an upright Italic simply because you&#39;ve &#34;always wanted to&#34;, or

  body: '&#39;art&#39; or &#39;Art&#39;? <BR> <BR>The difference is really one of
    intent and tradition. I&#39;m sure we all know what the difference is.  When I
    make a painting, even a digital one, it is Art &#40;or fine art &#40;it doesn&#39;t
    have to be good to qualify&#41;&#41;, the making of a fine peice of design is
    an art.  If your the making of your designs is an art then you are a good designer,
    if your paintings hang in a gallery you are an artist. <BR> <BR>John,  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#34;There
    is no grammar of visual imagery, there is no syntax, there are no rules of morphology:
    there is nothing in it that makes language language.&#34; <BR> <BR>I have to disagree
    with you.  Of course it all depends on the definition of the word language, but
    assuming it means something along the lines of a system of comunication that is
    agreed upon by the group of people that use it, then images certainly have a linguistic
    properties, with a full grammer and syntax. <BR> <BR>Taking line drawings as an
    example.  What does the line represent? In simple line drawings, it is commonly
    agreed &#40;it&#39;s grammer&#41; that a line represents an edge or division.
    This is arbitrary, it is a social construct.   <BR> <BR>Conventions of perspective
    are another grammer of imagery.  From full on renaisance three point perpsectives,
    to cubism, to simple drop shadow. They are all grammers necessary to show how
    objects ought to be arranged by our mind when we percieve the image. Perhaps analagous
    to word order in a sentance. <BR> <BR>I would go on to argue that nearly all qualities
    of images are subject to conventions such as these.  Even in photographs. Even
    the use areas of light or dark colours to show shadows and highlights. This is
    essentialy linguistic, in that they need to be agreed before being understood.
    <BR> <BR>Abstract painting is intersting in this respect, but I would say subject
    to the same rules.  Abrstact Expressionism seems to me to have been built on a
    fraud, at least as far as its emotional content is concerned. <BR> <BR> <BR>Ed.
    <BR> <BR>ps.  I hope that makes sense.  I wrote my dissertation on this, but am

    <BR>But that is a very superficial definition of language that completely ignores
    the seminal importance of language in cognition and self-consciousness. Language,

    at most contribute to what we are as members of particular cultures. So, above,
    Bill makes some comments about associations with colour, e.g. death, marriage,
    but these are specific cultural associations, and make even this level of &#39;visual
    communication&#39; increasingly problematic in multicultural societies. <BR> <BR><i>John,
    i think it&#39;s humorous that you&#39;re championing language as a superior communicator

    have such an argument without words, but this is what the fantasy of &#39;visual
    communication&#39; would suggest: that I could post a graphic that would make
    a point, and all the rest of you would post graphics making contrary points and
    refining previous graphics, and that this would constitute a conversation in a
    sense even remotely similar to our verbal exchanges. Because communication is
    not limited to a one-way transmission of information from source to recipient:
    it is the beginning of dialogue. One-way communication is the specialty of totalitarian
    and other repressive regimes, which it should be noted, favour visual and emotive
    media -- notably film and television -- over the textual and the reasoned &#40;books,
    newspapers, journals, Internet discussion groups&#41;. <BR> <BR>One-way transmission
    is also, of course, the primary characteristic of television and of most advertising,
    which assumes an unequal relationship between the power of the seller to persuade
    and the inability of the consumer to resist or even question whether he actually
    needs the product. This is the sort situation in which &#39;visial communication&#39;
    is effective: the manipulation of emotive response, usually ending in a credit
    card transaction. And this is why I do not consider it true communication, because
    ideas are actually anathema to the process, because ideas are generative and lead
    to other ideas, especially in the context of dialogue, while advertising and totalitarianism
    only want to put <i>one</i> thought in the recipient&#39;s mind: buy this, assent
    to this....'

  body: 'I&#39;ve been arguing, perhaps over-strenuously, against &#39;visual communication&#39;
    because I think it is something that too many people take for granted without
    really analysing, and also because I believe language is of an order of communication
    many times more sophisticated, more adaptable, more generative, than anything
    possible in visual, non-linguistic modes. But this is in part because the kind
    of communication that interests me is communication of <i>ideas,</i> and I&#39;m
    quite strict that communication, properly understood, requires a significant identity
    between the message broadcase and the message received, which I don&#39;t think
    is reliable in visual media: heck, it is often difficult enough with language,
    which is why most effective communication involves a two-way transmission that
    clarifies meaning via discourse.  <BR> <BR>There is, obviously, a common and less
    rigourous use of the term &#39;communicate&#39; that is often applied to the <i>impression</i>
    that we get from a visual cue, such as a particular arrangement of form and colour
    in design, a gesture or facial expression, or, as Hector notes, the way someone
    is dressed. I think Erik Spiekermann is correct when he says &#39;We cannot not
    communicate&#39;, <i>if</i> that is understood to mean &#39;We cannot not create
    an impression&#39;. And most graphic design is about creating impressions &#40;often
    false ones, it must be said&#41;. Impressions are important: what psychologists
    call &#39;thin-slicing&#39;, rapid intuitive judgement or inductive reasoning
    based on very short exposure -- the proverbial first impression that is often
    correct -- is an important method for navigating through life. And what is characterised
    as &#39;visual communication&#39; is an attempt to exploit this method by creating
    specific impressions, usually based on cultural associations. But I still don&#39;t
    think you can get away from two factors: 1&#41; the necessary correlation between
    what is broadcast and received, which is the basic measure of <i>successful</i>
    communication -- if the impression your design creates is not the impression you
    intended or hoped for, is it really communication? or is it a purely unilateral
    action on the part of the viewer? --, and 2&#41; the range of impressions it is
    possible to suggest are incredibly crude and small in number compared to the range
    of complex ideas that can be communicated through language. This is why the language
    of advertising people tends to rely on broad and vague  notions -- we want this
    to look elegant; we want something playful; it needs to be dynamic; etc. --: because
    the kind of impressions one can &#39;communicate&#39; visually &#40;inspire, really&#41;
    are that crude. Thinking about Erik Spiekermann&#39;s dictum again, one can say
    even that design primarily creates one of two impressions: &#39;We suck&#39; or
    &#39;We don&#39;t suck&#39;.'

  body: Psychologist Karl Buehler said that there are three levels of language. First
    expressive-Ouch!; second communicative - run!, third descriptive - take your third
    left and you will see the train station.  <BR>The idea is that the later levels
    presume the earlier. Popper added argumentative - no, it&#39;s the fourth right,
    not the third, because they&#39;ve moved the station entrance. Language can operate
    on the descriptive and argumentative levels in a much richer way than others.  <BR>
    <BR>But, John, when it comes to expressive and communicative levels, the visual
    and aural and smell and taste can do heavy lifting. Just think of how much of
    a movie&#39;s success is dependent on the actor&#39;s expression and tone of voice
    and body language. Yes, you often can&#39;t follow the plot of a movie without
    subtitles of a film in a language you don&#39;t understand. But dubbing destroys
    so much of the impact of a film compared to the tone of voice, even when you don&#39;t
    understand the words. As to vision, just substitute Miss Piggy for Marilyn Monroe,
    and you are going to get a different film, even with the same words.  <BR> <BR>With
    graphic design, the non-verbal elements are very important. Part is communicating
    heirarchy through visual relationships, as well as other conceptual relationships
    through visual relationships. And of course making sure words are easily readable
    - not easy in small sizes. And part is emotional tone and mood through color,
    use of space, illustration, photography.  <BR> <BR>It seems to me that a great
    graphic designer adds that emotional punch as well as clarity. To carry the metaphor
    further, you need a screenplay, but the screenplay isn&#39;t the movie. The great
    graphic designer is like a great director, and can turn the words into something
    more powerful than words alone.  <BR> <BR>I am a writer and love language, words,
    books - and even letters! But I know there is more to life, and graphic design
    is part of that more.

  body: '<i>But the tea pot is visually communicating...</i> <BR> <BR>This simple
    observation goes some way to reconciling some of the ideas in this thread. <BR>
    <BR>As Joe points out <i>it is the tea pot itself that is communicating</i>. One
    can say the same thing about anything else that we look at, including the products
    of graphic design: they can be said to communicate, and even if there is something
    metaphorical about this use of the term, it is close enough to a phenomenal description
    to be acceptable. Okay, so a thing can be said to communicate -- and since I gave
    the example of the Japanese tea pot, I have to admit that what it communicates
    goes beyond a vague impression: it is a sophisticated carrier of aesthetical values
    of a particular culture. And, of course, this was also my point about type design.
    <BR> <BR>Even so, there remains an important difference between saying that a
    thing communicates something to the viewer and saying that the maker of that thing
    communicates with the viewer. In the latter construction, you meet all my previous
    criticisms of the unreliability of non-verbal communication, because it remains
    very uncertain that what the thing communicates to the viewer is going to share
    significant identity with what the maker wants to communicate. [To get theological
    for a moment, one could even make this observation on a grand scale: noting that
    what creation communicates to most human beings is not necessarily what God intended
    to communicate; hence the need for verbal revelation.] <BR> <BR>So, Tiffany, I
    don&#39;t think <i>you</i> are a visual communicator, but what you design is.
    The relationship between what you might want to communicate and what a specific
    design actually communicates to a particular viewer may range from close identity
    to complete dissonance, over which you will only ever have very partial control.'

    about the tea pot is precisely about this idea of signification, of things as
    carriers of meaning. My point is only that this does not necessarily constitute
    <i>communication,</i> which is the transfer if meaning, between the maker of a
    thing and the beholder of a thing. Which is why I question the idea of designers
    as visual communicators: the term implies a certainty that is largely absent from
    the practice. But note that while I do not think visual communication is anything
    like as powerful or reliable as verbal communication, I do not think signification
    -- the investment of meaning in a thing -- is in any sense less phenomenal than
    communication. Indeed, I wouldn&#39;t be much of a Catholic if I believed that.
    Signification may, in fact, be much more powerful and effective than mere communication,
    or it may be as banal as the emptiest verbal expression: to a very large degree
    it depends what is being communicated or signified, <i>Pace,</i> McLuhan, the

  body: 'John, I usually find myself agreeing with you in this forum, but on this
    issue you are just flat wrong, and significantly wrong for this issue at hand.  <BR>
    <BR>In the first place, &#39;communication&#39; does not imply the certainty that
    you claim. According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary one meaning of this word
    is &#39;d. impart &#40;feelings etc.&#41; non-verbally &#40;communicated his affection&#41;&#39;.
    So non-verbal communication is one normal understanding of this term, including
    its ambiguity.  <BR> <BR>What the philosophical term &#39;signification&#39; means
    is in fact probably a lot fuzzier than the normal English &#39;communication&#39;,
    which is ambiguous enough.  <BR> <BR>I think you are confusing communication with
    description. I mentioned Karl Buehler&#39;s distinction above, and I think it
    is valid. Verbal description is a way to communicate, but there are many other
    ways. For example animals communicate a lot, but do not describe, with the possible
    exception of the dance of bees and apes who have been taught sign language. If
    Buehler is wrong, tell me why.    <BR> <BR>Typefaces are abstract shapes with
    no direct descriptive reference, and so they are quite ambiguous. One can be more
    decorative, one more spare, and so on, and then there are historical associations
    and memories of where the same kind of face is used. Hence typefaces by themselves
    can communicate, but are quite limited in what they can communicate by their design.  <BR>
    <BR>However, typefaces are only one ingredient or one tool of the designer&#39;s
    trade, and the good ones are going to use every visual means to communicate effectively.
    <BR> <BR>What is most important to understand, is that non-verbal communication
    is often emotionally more powerful and persuasive. It is not for nothing that
    most designers are paid in one way or another for advertising. But this goes for
    any communication. <BR> <BR>And the messages are much more specific than &#39;this
    is good&#39; or &#39;this is bad&#39;. Let me take two examples from what I am
    work I am doing now. First, by the design of my book &#39;Sayings of the Sages&#39;
    &#40;I am author and designer, but not publisher&#41;, I am trying to communicate:
    &#34;These sayings are a precious legacy, which you would want to know, but they
    and the discussion of them are warm and accessible and not threatening.&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>To get the &#39;precious&#39; and &#39;classic&#39; feel I am using a classic
    design, with red and black on ivory paper, using Jenson. To keep it welcoming
    the book is not too fat, and each set of sayings with all of its explanation and
    discussion guide is on one set of facing pages. There is also a fair amount of
    white space. I hope the cover will have some of the clean black and red Jenson,
    with a gold filagree frame, and everything will have classic repose and beauty.  <BR>
    <BR>All this is a quite specific impression I want to create, and whether I succeed
    or not, this is exactly one important kind of thing that good graphic design can
    do. Actually I could go through every design decision, and tell you how it is
    designed to give a specific message, or to increase easy of access and understanding.
    Of course, beauty is one goal, but that is because it serves my purpose.   <BR>
    <BR>A related kind of challenge is in a chart I am now working on of the Sages,
    including a time line. Here I am trying to include a great deal of information
    in a way that the reader can easily grasp. This is the kind of problem that Edward
    Tufte discusses in his books. Here the designer is using &#39;visual logic&#39;
    to match the concepts that are you are attempting to communicate. And the design
    decisions are also not value neutral. For example, events of the outside world
    and the dates of the sages are prominent in my design. For Orthodox Jews this
    is subversive of the idea that all the sayings are in fact &#39;mi-sinai&#39;,
    from Sinai, from God, and timeless. And I mean it to be subversive; it&#39;s a
    conscious decision designed to be persuasive of a point of view.  <BR> <BR>Now
    graphic designers also regularly use illustration and photography with text also,
    which again can communicate even more specifically, and often with great emotional
    power. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t like the term &#39;visual communicator&#39;, which
    has no poetry, or is the opposite of poetry. But Tiffany is right on target concerning
    the task of graphic designers. It communicates to me, clearly and verbally!   <BR>
    <BR>&#62;I do not think visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable
    as verbal communication <BR> <BR>Powerful and reliable are two different things.
    Right on &#39;reliable&#39;, wrong on &#39;powerful&#39;. I will give you an example.  <BR>
    <BR>A lady I knew liked my work and had me out to talk to her community about
    applying traditional ethics to modern life - in fact she had done a Master&#39;s
    thesis on this topic, I learned.  <BR> <BR>She was very friendly, then I didn&#39;t
    hear from her for some time afterwards. Well, I blew that, I figured. Then I spotted
    her at a conference, buying a book. She saw me out of the corner of her eye, but
    seemed reluctant to acknowledge me. Ah, well. Then she turned suddenly, blew me
    a kiss, and rushed off. There was no mistaking the sincere affection, but what
    was that all about? Two months later I read of her death from cancer. This was
    her kiss goodbye. I cherish her memory. Would an e-mail; &#39;sorry I haven&#39;t
    been well, best wishes&#39; have done the same as that blown kiss that haunts
    my memory? Did it communicate? With ambiguity, but what power.'

  body: '&#62; I questioned whether it was reliable enough for someone to describe
    herself, professionally, as a &#39;visual communicator&#39;. <BR> <BR>Well, we
    are now on the same page. Your point about the greater ambiguity of visual communication
    is generally sound, as I have acknowledged. However, no graphic designer claims
    that they are going to communicate for their client by visual means alone, without
    language. What is rather conveyed is that the designer will help make the visual
    &#42;dimension&#42; of the communication complement the words, so that the overall
    communication is more effective and persuasive than words alone would be.  <BR>
    <BR>Designers never claim to substitute for the writer, so your argument is misplaced.
    You don&#39;t acknowledge that using the visual dimension to communicate text
    more effectively is in fact the task of a graphic designer - which I take to be
    Tiffany&#39;s point.  <BR> <BR>In a very text-heavy setting, a lot of that effort
    will not be emotional, but pragmatic: making the text easy and comfortable to
    read. But even in text-heavy environments, the emotional dimension is very important,
    because you want to increase the chances that you are going to be read, and have
    the emotional tone of the visual match the tone of the text.  <BR> <BR>Also even
    in text-heavy environments the visual design can be critical to understanding.
    Maps and equations are examples. The graphics of these communicate much more effectively
    than verbal explanation of the same thing. And effective visual presentation of
    information just from the point of view of quick comprehension is a field in itself,
    as Tufte&#39;s books illustrate.  <BR> <BR>When there are fewer words and more
    graphic elements, then the visual will play a stronger role, but still in service
    of the client&#39;s message in words, with their persuasive purpose. For example,
    I think of the great theatrical posters that Christos Tsolerides has put up on
    Typophile for critique. These could have just had the name and location in large
    Arial letters black on white, no illustrations, and verbally communicated just
    as well. But they certainly would not have been as inviting to the potential audience.  <BR>
    <BR>Now as to the power of the blown kiss. I took this example to acknowledge
    your point about the ambiguity of visual communication alone, but to make clear
    the additional power that the visual element can add power that is not in words
    alone. First of all the blown kiss, with the expression on the face, did communicate
    affection and good will powerfully; you are just flat wrong that it failed to
    communicate. The full sad meaning, it is true, only became clear when I learned
    more. But my point is that I could have the same information from e-mail messages,
    as I said. The blown kiss was way more powerful than words alone.'

    is really an example of the importance of the interpretational context. This is
    what changed between the blowing of the kiss and your eventual understanding of
    it.  <BR> <BR>But I don&#39;t want to analyse to death what is obviously a profound
    personal memory for you, so I&#39;ll clarify what I meant when I wrote that I
    don&#39;t consider &#39;visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable
    as verbal communication&#39;. I&#39;m clearly not referring to emotional power:
    I&#39;m talking about the power of language that comes from its flexibility, sophistication,
    its productive ability to create context, i.e. power as effective ability, not
    direct force. I&#39;m not saying that the raw impact of visual media is less powerful
    than that of language; obviously this is not so, and this is why people rely on
    visual means to attract attention, inspire a emotional response, and communicate
    impressions within a framework of cultural associations &#40;such as your example
    of a &#39;precious&#39; and &#39;classic&#39; feel&#41;. Visuals do all these
    things well. But what I&#39;ve been talking about is the power of language to
    communicate, especially to communicate ideas, especially complex ideas; again,
    this is power in the sense of effective ability, of &#39;having the power to do
    more&#39;. I come back to the example I raised earlier: this discussion could
    not be had visually. In terms of <i>communication,</i> language is more powerful
    because it has more effective ability to convey ideas from one mind to another.'

    the conventional and culturally-bound &#39;systems&#39; of meaning in art and
    design and the centrality of natural language to human thought and to self-consciousness
    is huge. Indeed, the former is only understandable by virtue of the latter. As
    soon as you start to consciously think about something that you are looking at,
    it ceases to be visual and starts to become thoughts in your mind that are formed
    through language.

    that way.  <BR>To speak of &#34;communication&#34; requires not only somebody
    uttering something by words or gesture or leaving physical marks here and there,
    i.e. &#34;design&#34;, but also somebody interpreting these utterances &#42;some
    or another way&#42;. Some one saying something and another one not even paying

    them but must conceive of, or guess at, them. The only thing one actually &#34;has&#34;
    are the marks, the material side of signs: sounds, gestures, ink on paper, which
    are to be interpreted. But these marks are just as unstable as are &#34;ideas&#34;
    themselves, especially when it comes to &#34;visual/visible language&#34;. Unfortunately,
    communication by visual means is not a subject taught at schools, and so there
    are no lessons in ethics of use. What some one considers a mark, someone else
    doesn&#39;t necessarily too; and not in all circumstances all aspects of the mark
    are of importance. &#40;This latter aspect can be found in Buehler&#39;s writings

    regards &#34;design&#34; as problem-solving or otherwise is his personal choice,
    based on his background and motivation for becoming a designer. To me, design
    as problem-solving is not the worst description -- I assume that most design jobs
    are in fact tidying up visually things that others are incapable to lay out properly.
