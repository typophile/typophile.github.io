body: "I have a font I'm trying to develop which has 2 custom glyphs which are tpic
  or dingbat-like in nature. I want to preserve the relationship between the normal
  character glyphs height and the custom glyph height. However the custom glyph image
  is VERY wide - 2397 wide x 719 high in a 1000 UPM Postscript-flavor OTF font.\r\n\r\nAs
  of now. I have placed each in a single glyph cell and assigned them PUI unicode
  values. In testing so far, the only issue I have seen is the preview in adobes glyoh
  pallette is getting cropped. Otherwise, things seem fine. I am setting myself for
  trouble later or is this acceptable practice?\r\n\r\n"
