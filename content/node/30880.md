  recently Chanpory Rith posted a nice parable that I thought some of you might enjoy.\r\n\r\n<em>
  \r\n\r\n    The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the
  class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would
  be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely
  on its quality.\r\n\r\n    His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he
  would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the \u201Cquantity\u201D
  group: fifty pound of pots rated an \u201CA\u201D, forty pounds a \u201CB\u201D,
  and so on. Those being graded on \u201Cquality\u201D, however, needed to produce
  only one pot\u2014albeit a perfect one\u2014to get an \u201CA\u201D.\r\n\r\n    Well,
  came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were
  all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the \u201Cquantity\u201D
  group was busily churning out piles of work\u2014and learning from their mistakes\u2014the
  \u201Cquality\u201D group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had
  little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead
  clay.\r\n\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nThe original post: http://www.lifeclever.com/2007/01/23/what-50-pounds-of-clay-can-teach-you-about-design/
  \r\n\r\nAnyone have any thoughts to add, or maybe other parables? "

  body: "It's a useful idea; the more you do something the better you get, but there's
    a missing corollary; some people really do only think about quantity, they never
    improve, and they never consider quality. Fred Goudy could really have stood to
    throw away a bunch of his designs. He crowed about the number of designs he had
    put out, but many came out unusable. Was the universe doing him a favor by burning
    his studio down twice? \r\n\r\nConversely, there are people who put quality first,
    and they probably <strong>release</strong> less work, but it isn't necessarily
    true that they don't explore, learn, or derive experience in the process. The
    message is really that you need both: spend substantial time learning by doing,
    discarding the early results, and eventually you will come up with something good.
    \r\n\r\nPottery is a good analogy; generally the first 100 pots anyone throws
    are crap. Some teachers of pottery won't allow a student to fire a piece until
    they've thrown for years. It's a good way to keep the student focused on the techniques
    of throwing without getting dazzled by glazes and other effects. It's a focus
    on structure, which I think is very important. \r\n\r\nI've often said: throw
    away your first type design (or 3). Veronika Burian and Bram de Does are exceptions
    to this, of course. "

    what it means is that it'll likely be crap. Oh well. Still have to do it. And
    I'm learning a lot from this forum. Sadly, my full-time job only leaves me about
    4-6 hours a week to work on font stuff.

    Now that I am freelancing I have a little more time for type work, but it never
    seems like enough.  :-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, don't be discouraged. I made (still make!)
    lots and lots of mistakes on my first font projects, but I've learned that making
    mistakes is good -- as long as you learn from them and use that knowledge on your
    next project."
