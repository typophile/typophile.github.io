  body: "I was going to suggest Bouwsma's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.9382.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Squirrel+Creek&sampleSize=60\">Ludovico
    Woodcut</a>, because it was similar and had the rougher quality, but I can see
    you nailed it Yves. Good eye.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
