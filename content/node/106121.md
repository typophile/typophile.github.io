  body: "Can't find a perfect match but you could try to approximate it using either
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/twentieth-century-mt|MTI Twientieth Century]]
    Ultra Bold or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura-no-2|URW++ Futura <strong>No
    2</strong>]] Extra Bold (in order to get such /G) and mainly redrawing /M.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Casady & Greene Sans Serif has also the wrong /M, probably a clone of Futura No
    2 actually."
