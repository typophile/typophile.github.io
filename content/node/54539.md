body: "I'm helping with the design of a small art and literature publication on campus,
  where students submit their work to be published to all students and faculty. \r\n\r\nOur
  editor has already chosen a theme, 'death and the passing of time', which the work
  we've received (photos, prints, paintings, etc.) is centered around. The body is
  all student work, no articles or ads; it is set in a theme each year based what
  we receive, which is 'death and the passing of time'.\r\n\r\nThe dilemma I'm having
  is choosing a typeface to incorporate that 'theme'. I know of typefaces for books,
  but I'm also having trouble selecting one.\r\n\r\nMy request may sound odd, but
  if you know of any typefaces that can incorporate that theme (e.g. carvings in headstones,
  memorials, plaques, or in the rustic/medieval/classical realm) or are great for
  books, I'd appreciate any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n~ corey"

  body: Maybe like a roman carved type font (all caps) which suggests marble. Then
    again if you have to set a whole book something like Mrs Eaves would serve you
    better since it would allow you a whole font family that has a slightly formal
    feel. The last thing you want is a casual feel for "death".

  body: "I keep thinking of Dante.\r\n\r\nBut it would help to define the intended
    tone of your typography more deeply. \r\nAre you trying to design something that
    \"accommodates\" death and presents it in a \"digestible\" way \u2013 much like
    you'd probably do if you were designing an identity for an undertaker \u2013,
    or something that retains, and reflects, some of the primal, mortal fear?"
