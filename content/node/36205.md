  layout later on.  Am wondering if the kerning, etc. on these look OK.  See any adjustments
  I should make?\r\n\r\nAm trying to improve in this area and see what people knowledgeable
  about type see -- so be as critical as you like.\r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: the kerning on IVE on the second logo needs opening up as they seem to be
    overlapping but thats more to do with the letterforms really. I prefer the top
    logo as the letterforms fit together better.

  body: I prefer the second version because the fewer swashes the better it is for
    logo retention.

  body: "Thanks for reviewing this.  I've decided that I think I want a bit more here.\r\n\r\nIf
    I make the first letter larger than the rest of the letters, should leave it in
    its natural scaled weight, or attempt to have the weight of all letters the same
    (which would require me to sort of \"redraw\" the \"R\" here).\r\n\r\nPlease check
    out the second uploaded example for what I mean.  Opinions appreciated!"
