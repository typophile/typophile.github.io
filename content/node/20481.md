  client is opening a venue with a modern-deco feel and we are trying to find a suitable
  typeface as their corporate font.\r\nWe love Scala Sans - however for several reasons
  we are unable to use that exact face - can anyone suggest an alternate face? I particularly
  love the crossed 'W' and anything that gives a sophisticated feel would be great.\r\n\r\nMany
  Thanks,\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi, \r\nThanks for the replies - much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe've already
      looked at Neutra - but the low x height isn't quite as subtle as we'd like.\r\n\r\nStephen
      - reasoning for not using Scala is that our client came to us with a sample
      menu from another venue which uses Scala as their corporate face - (although
      they no longer exist we don't simply want to imitate what had been done prior
      - especially that they are in the same field)"

  body: "Patty - I was a little perplexed by the FF Nexus release as well, but it
    slowly became clear. The family was developed together from the ground up, resulting
    in a much more compatible set of fonts. I am still a huge FF Scala fan, but FF
    Nexus serves well if congruous slab, sans, serif, and mono variants are all needed.\r\n\r\nMore
