  body: 'Wow an old fashion (retro) company. Well thats what I get when looking at
    that lampshade. Hardly a contempory multimedia look. The type is just boring and
    needs work on the kerning. Thoughts on fixes: first use a contempory lamp. Show
    only part of it and leave something to the imagination or make the lamp interact
    with the name. Investigate other more contempory and interesting type faces. Now
    my biggest complaint solve the logos look in black and white, then explore colors.
    Colors distract from basic faults. '

    all have to say.\r\n\r\nI think that perhaps our design idea is being misinterpreted
    - yes, we were going for a 'retro' feel, because we felt it was warm and approachable.
    \ We thought the 'organic' quality, established through the colour scheme, the
    imperfect lettering and the irregular box, helped convey the message \"we're a
    small company, personable and human.\"\r\n\r\nWe completely understand your thoughts
    on the lettering.  Perhaps we SHOULD go for Sackers Gothic.  I'll post a revision
    to the logo shortly."

  body: "Jay, I think the responses here are a good indication that the logo is a
    bit flat without context. The design above would probably benefit from the context
    of a website or stationary, but it really should be able to stand alone. The type
    isn't working as you probably want it to (I think it's not going far enough, personally,
    if you want to go for organic and human with the hand-drawn feel).\r\n\r\nI like
    the <i>idea</i> of the mark (the lamp, the light, the cut-paper feel, the lampshade
    being an external cover for a lightbulb which = inspiration/ideas), but the execution
    seems a bit off. First of all, that lampshade's ornament screams 'grandma lamp'
    to me. There's just no way around it. Though, I'm guessing a non-ornamental design
    looks a bit plain. Not sure what to tell you. Perhaps the addition of a hanging
    chain if you simplify the shade? Also, the lampshade clashes with the structure
    of sans. The two seem fundamentally dischordant, and the contrast isn't clicking
    for me. The lampshade's ornament wants Mrs. Eaves-esque warmth and friendly serifs,
    and the type wants an Ikea lamp.\r\n\r\nNot sure how to make it work, but if you
    do, I think it'll be great. Perhaps take a look at <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/\">Apple's
    iLife logo</a>, which strikes some similar visual chords. (The green made me think
    of it.)"

    noted the concept of hidden/discovered light could work, though you could improve
    on it, the lamp stand and base look too modern to work with the shade. Alternatively
    you could develop a praxinoscope look \r\nhttp://images.google.co.uk/images?q=praxinoscope&ie=ISO-8859-1&hl=en\r\nfor

  body: "#3 doesn't do it for me at all. It screams \"late 90s web design firm\",
    and having spent several years toiling in the salt mines for one of those, I don't
    like to be reminded of it. I kind of dig the ominous penumbra around the lamp,
    but the lettering and that brownish-red... they kinda make me think of failed
    dotcoms, as well as making me twitch.\r\n\r\nI actually prefer the original to
    your revisions, and here's why: it totally evokes your group's background in film,
    because it reminds me of Saul Bass's classic title designs from the 1950s and
    1960s. The rough feel of the Neo Retro, the layout of the elements, the idea of
    the lamp, they all work for me. I agree with those who say the lampshade is too
    frowsy for what you're trying to do, but that's my only real problem with the
    design. It looks retro without being too ironic.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose one
    of the revisions, I'd go with the type from #1 with the layout and icon from #2."

    text and whatnot that needs to go with it, but I like the colors and font and
    shapes together. I'd try comping up some variations of that to see how they look
    all tiny -- my concern is that the current layout will eat up a lot of space.
    Aside from that, though, I think it looks great!

    I repeat my reservation that the light should go up as well as down). The step
    from shade to light looks too much to me it implies too great a thickness to the
    shade. The lettering with its repeats of letter shapes looks a bit contrived,
    each letter should be subtly different, also the L is a bit thin in the vertical.\r\nTim"

    stands looks sloppy (type and kerning), and old the kind of lamp you are using.

    but that's how we like it.  Our company is casual but dedicated, and as important
    as a corporate image is, our personalities and networking capabilities are attracting
    clients a month before we actually launch and we will keep them coming back.\r\n\r\nWhile
    we appreciate your opinion and everyone is entitled to their own, you came off
    really very harshly in your last post.  While tone is an extremely difficult thing
    to convey over the Internet, common courtesy would have steered you away from
    such harsh vocabulary.  This forum is a critique, not a platform for slander.
    \ Many of us are new at this and just learning the ropes (as you might have guessed
    by the fact this logo is for a new graphic design firm and I'm a new member to

  body: An honest blunt critique is the best learning tool..I've learned to not take
    anything personally because in the end it's all business and delivering the best
    design to communicate the message properly. Retro, Indie type fonts may be your
    best resource.The lampshade needs to be very simple. The original lampshade displays
    a very feminine feel. In the new logos 1.d and p fit well between the lines and
    is the best font choice so far. 2. the d and p don't fit well.3. the box isn't
    needed and the shadow won't reduce too well in B/W and faxes. I would experiment
    with a 50's retro look with colours which are less saturated like a mint green
    and pastal yellow..with a scroll type frame or stylized scroll type lamp illustration.
    I really like the name and I think the right funky script(but different than the
    one in proof 3, because it's too cartoony.)will result in the approachable,friendly
    and unique company. Good Luck!

    more homegrown \"organic\" stuff, then that's fine. But I think there's a really
    fantastic logo only a few more redesigns away. \r\n\r\nP.S. I have a very similar

  body: Really like the concept and I like drawing no. 2 best. Maybe if you want a
    casual, ('quirky' even) style you use a jaunty angle for the box surrounding the
    lampshade. I prefer hand-lettering over type; it shows a bit more effort has gone
    into the design and makes it look more personal.  Have a look at <a href="http://www.houseind.com/">House
    Industries</a>' work - very immediate and attention-getting. And it shows that
    you can have a stylish clean look along with personality at the same time.

    work. To me, there is too many things going on here, with the lampshade, the light,
    the framing, the stroke on the frame, the type's relation to the style of the
    drawing, and so on.\r\nWhat about focusing on the lampshade only? Use that first
    very 40's looking lampshade as a shape, a silhouette, which gets its explanation
    from the company name."

  body: "Hey there, Jay,\r\n\r\nYou reply to Dan that it\u2019s a shame he doesn\u2019t
    like the concept, because you think it works pretty well. I think you shouldn't
    put up your logo here for critique if you can't stand people being critical. Of
    course there is the issue of bluntness, but you are way better off with a blunt
    and just critique than a friendly but hazy one.\r\n\r\nHaving said that - I think
    the basic concept of the logo is very nice. I agree with others that it needs
    working on, though. You may like the concept, but it is your customers that must
    do the liking, and I think you can assist them better than you do now.\r\n\r\nThe
    lamp icon can be a strong image. In the latest version it is getting there, but
    graphically it is still quite busy. What can you throw away without losing the
    overall feel? Do you really need a box around the image? Can the lamp be bigger,
    smaller, simpler, richer, etc?\r\n\r\nA design teacher of mine once gave me a
    nice method to develop an image. Take a big sheet of paper and divide in lots
    of squares. Force yourself to draw the image again and again until you have filled
    the paper. Try all kinds of variations, everything you can think of, and don't
    be critical. The fun starts when you are out of ideas but still have to go on
    to fill the page. That's when the obvious solutions dry out and the creative ones
    appear. You may be surprised with what you can come up with. Sounds like a lot
    of work? Might be, but your logo is worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy
