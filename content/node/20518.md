  body: Identifont would benefit from allowing users to post font info themselves.
    An Identifont wiki if you will. They also need to draw a more firm distinction
    between fonts that fit the criteria you're searching for and those that are merely
    similar. I'm not sure I've ever used it to any successful conclusion since it
    seems to spit back every typeface in it's database if a match is not found.

  body: Yeah, I can only think of once or twice that it has actually given me the
    font I'm looking for. I think they should try to narrow down the font family (slabserif,
    geometric, etc) earlier in the process so it doesn't give you some crazy deco
    font when you want a garalde.

    that's not in its database you'll always get similartos.

    he's busy, but he's always been very responsive and open to suggestions. There
    is also to add the fact many foundries were reluctant to give Identifont pictures
    and informations on their faces, which is very stupid.\r\n\r\nIdentifont is not
    perfect, but David is willing to make it always better\u2026"
