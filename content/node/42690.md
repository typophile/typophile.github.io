  town.\r\n\r\nThis first one puzzles me, how can an old street be unadopted? The
  street sign was on a wall of a pretty old building. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unadopted_l_4345.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  old shop sign was on a wall of a side street building. Got some funny looks when
  I took the photo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Emu_1_5476.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Emu_2_5661.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
