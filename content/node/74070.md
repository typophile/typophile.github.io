body: "This is a typeface that has been used a lot for the Harry Potter films, particularly
  the first two. However, just as I was about to start thinking that this font was
  custom designed, I found it on the packaging of each of the three films of The Lord
  of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition) DVD collection.
  Therefore, I conclude it must be a commercially available font (I say this because
  it looks expensive to me. XD). The examples I include here are from high-resolution
  PDF snapshots and scans of the DVD packaging of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s
  Stone (Two Disc Set) and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Special Extended
  Edition).\r\nI have discerned that there are differences between what I (rightly
  or wrongly) perceive to be the regular and bold weights, being noticeably the uppercase
  G, H, L, M, R, and lowercase g.\r\nPlease, please, PLEASE help me out with the name
  of this font!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HGM_3907.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HPM_3542.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RWM_6013.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6026.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4123.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4627.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_5690.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_6111.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6_6282.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7_6229.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8_3735.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Many-adventures_6137.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/The-Fellowship's-Journey_6576.gif]"

  body: "Found it - by myself, I might add.\r\nIt's a gorgeous font family called
    Flourish by Judith Sutcliffe, sold through FontShop (http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/electric_typographer/flourish/).
    The samples I provided are namely Flourish and Flourish Bold Special, so I was
    somewhat right about there being differences between the regular and bold weights.
    I was also right about it being expensive ($160 for the Flourish package of 6
    fonts, with none of the fonts being available individually).\r\nOh my..."
