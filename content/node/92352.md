  body: They should be named according to what base character they represent. So in
    the most common situation where the small cap glyph is being substituted for "a",
    you should call it "a.smcp".

  body: "Here's the deal: For the document you're preparing, the use of small cps
    is a mater of style. It doesn't mater what you call them. But the *file* you're
    preparing may have other uses. And the possible PDF you're preparing may have
    the text extracted for other use. With a PDF, anything after the period can be
    lost. In that case, should the letter be upper or lower case? By having both A.sc
    and a.sc, everything is resolved.\r\n\r\nIn spite of that, I tend to use A.sc
    only. I work in a fairly limited environment: books only. In that kind of work,
    when a style uses small capitals, replacement by a full cap is almost always  acceptable,
    though may not be preferable. Replacement by a lower case letter can be just wrong.\r\n\r\nIt
    is not too much extra work to have both. Having both does use up some of the allowable
    65,000 kerns possible...\r\n\r\n& BTW, since there is a limit to the number of
    characters you can have as names for glyphs in a font, if you're planning a large
    number of glyphs, using \"sc\" instead of \"smcp\" saves a few..."

  body: "Tim, that's exactly what we do if a client insists that text be searchable
    and extractable from PDFs that have been distilled from print streams (and hence
    rely on Acrobat parsing of glyph names to reconstruct text). \r\n\r\nWe have other
    clients who don't care about this, and are happy to have only one set of smallcap
    glyphs, in which case I tend to call them something like /A.sc/ or in some older
    fonts /A.small/.\r\n\r\nAnd then we have one client who actively doesn't want
    to make fonts compatible with Acrobat in this way, like their TTFs to have format
    3 post tables, which contain no glyph names."

  body: "My recommendation is the following: \r\n\r\n1. If you decide to duplicate
    the small caps glyphs, i.e. to have separate sets of identical small caps glyphs,
    one to work with the \"smcp\" feature and one to work with the \"c2sc\" feature,
    then I recommend naming the glyphs intended for \"smcp\" using lowercase names,
    i.e. \"a.smcp\", and the glyphs intended for \"c2sc\" using uppercase names i.e.
    \"A.c2sc\". This gives you a very clean distinction. \r\n\r\n2. If you decide
    to include just one set of small caps glyphs, the I think using uppercase names
    is better because those glyphs will resolve to all-uppercase text strings, and
    those are better than all-lowercase text strings (i.e. \"I had an IBM machine
    an an OLIVETTI machine\" is better than \"I had an ibm machine and an olivetti
    machine\"). In this case, I'd name the glyphs either \"A.smcp\" or \"A.c2sc\".
    In fact, these days I'm leaning towards \"A.c2sc\" as the generic name for small
    caps, because that makes standardizing glyph names easier. \r\n\r\nIn other words,
    your basic set of small cap glyphs could be named \"A.c2sc\" etc., and, should
    you choose to include a duplicate set, that set could be named \"a.smcp\". \r\n\r\nI
    think this is the \"cleanest\" and most systematic solution. "
