  I have no idea how to find it. I remember it was used for a corporate identity of
  an architect. It is a font which has some kind of wavy baseline, it reminds me of
  water. The letters were somehow added on top of the waves. Here's an image of the
  wavy baseline:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/waves_font_5109.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for the name of this font. Does anybody know what font this could have
  been?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    not an architectural firm, but the only 'wavy baseline' logo I know of is the
    old one for PriceWaterhouseCoopers (http://www.editorsweblog.org/logos/PWC.jpg)\r\n\r\nIs
    that sort of the effect you remember?"

  body: "Hi, thanks for your answers. But no, it was not this kind of wavy. It really
    looked like the line I have sketched. \r\nThe u for example really looked like
    one of these arcs. It was somehow made just with one line, more like a script
    face.\r\nAnybody else any ideas?"
