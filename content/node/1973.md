body: I&#39;ve had this idea of creating a book that celebrates the art of opening
  titles in world cinema for a while now. The project is too ambitious to do all by
  myself, so I&#39;m opening it up here to give it a chance to come to life as a collaborative
  effort. <BR> <BR>My plan is to focus in paricular on the power of the written word
  and its potential to evoke emotion, just by the impact of how it looks. I have collected
  screenshots of opening sequences and other material for years, with an emphasis
  on the immediacy found in handwriting / brushwork /  letterwork. I envision devoted
  professionals with a keen eye for the written word taking on particular chapters,
  that they feel an affinity to. <BR> <BR>Other ideas on how to proceed are welcomed
  as well...<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19964.gif" alt="expressive

  body: Saul Bass is of course a classic, but you should also check out more contemporary
    designers too, such as Kyle Cooper.

    Movie Database.

  body: Nick - because I can not quite believe that I&#39;m the only one out there
    who likes to look at interesting letterwork, especially, if the material is shown
    for the first time and presented in an engaging manner.
