  body: "For the sans: strange... part of this \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura-esque]]\"
    /M, that looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]]...\r\nFor
    the serif: once more, strange... part of this [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/modern-no-216/|Modern
    No216 /S]] (may be that's my eyes), that looks pretty close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monotype-century-schoolbook|Century
    Schoolbook]] or may be I've not spotted the right version of Century or it has
    been stretched a bit. Anyway, that's very \"Century\"."
