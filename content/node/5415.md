  body: It must be something available commercially somewhere, but in a pinch you
    could get the lettershapes out of the free font <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nb_ppp=40&amp;texte=SHOWMAG%2Bshowmag&amp;nq=1&amp;q=showtime&amp;Submit=%2BGo%2B">Showtime</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Actually, if you only need a few letters, it looks like a pretty easy
    face to draw from scratch.
