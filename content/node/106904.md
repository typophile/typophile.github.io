body: "Hello, I made this design about a year ago. However I recently lost all of
  my files due to hard drive failure and I want to remake this design, but I can't
  seem to find the font. (I have a copy of the image saved, but not the .psd file
  itself)\r\n\r\nI thought it was one of the fonts that are included with the computer
  (Macbook Pro) but after looking through all of them, I guess it isn't. \r\n\r\nIt
  bears resemblance to Arial/Helvetiva but thinner, especially the letter E.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help me find the font.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\ninspecting\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_mh7qk5VOPU1s38vjto1_500_5759.png]"

    recognized it as Bebas Neue. I do recall using this font several times for a number
    of things.
