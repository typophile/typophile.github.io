  body: "Ahem.\r\n\r\nSteve Matteson is the original perpetrator of Curlz, let it
    be known, and it was commissioned by a custom client for inclusion in a laser
    printer. Curlz is well known for the same reason Comic Sans is well known; it
    was distributed widely and made available to many, via bundling. \r\n\r\nMy part
    in the development of Curlz was as a hired hand to finish the character set, same
    as the work I did on Wood Type 3 (Chromatics). Haven't we all had jobs like that?
    Matching the style of existing characters is a useful skill in type design for
    those times when the client has some lettering, a sign, a logo, that has to be
    preserved. You should see the \"rustic\", \"elegant\", and other period styles
    I've been asked to match. \r\n\r\n\"calligraphy is to angst what scones are to
    rave parties.\"\r\n\r\n: D"

    and John Mayer, and I've been to both of their concerts more than once (or maybe
    it just felt like I did).
