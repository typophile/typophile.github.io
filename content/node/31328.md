body: "Help me convince my marketing boss that there is a better solution to making
  body copy more readable that does not simply involve \"making it bigger\".\r\n\r\nWe
  have a magazine that was set in 10 pt. AGaramond (leading was set to \"auto\" in
  Quark - before I started working there). I produced the next issue in InDesign using
  Bembo set in 9.5 pt. with leading at 10 pt. but set to align to a baseline interval
  setting of 0.15 inches. It was flush left, ragged right and hyphenations were turned
  off.\r\n\r\nNow, their argument is that because our target audience is anywhere
  from the 40's and 50's up to the 60'70's male reader, their eye sight isn't so good
  anymore and they mostly will have several pairs of glasses. So they want larger
  type so it's easier to read.\r\n\r\nMy problem is the AGaramond set at 10 pt. just
  looks too large to me. It reduces the class of the magazine. I believe that there
  are other settings or even other typefaces (sans serif) that can be utilized for
  better readability at slightly smaller point sizes that is comparable to the 10
  pt. set AGaramond.\r\n\r\nCan I get some help with this? Are there any websites
  out there that discuss this issue and offer solutions?\r\n\r\nMany many thanks in
  advance."

    in 9pt for example. What disturbes you, is it too bold in your opinion, is it
    not \"quiet\" enough, etc. \r\nYou can check against with Sabon for example. Which
    is a bit more quiet, but still elegant and a tick more formal in apperance.\r\n\r\nLeading
    \"auto\" is quite okay at \"normal\" width of your textcolumn.\r\nHow many words
    appear in your textcolumn, Tschichold talks about 12 words maximum \u2026 \r\nIncrease
    the leading, does it look better, is it easier to read? Or reduce wordspacing,
    does it look better, when leading is set to 120% (auto)? \r\n \r\nDid you print
    the example textsettings with a good printer \u2013 the monitor often \"lies\"?
    You're talking about a magazine, in my opinion the typeface here has to set a
    bit larger than in a book, where the reader reads linear and normally with a reduced
    distance, if you compare it with the use of a magazine. But surely you can't say
    - 10pt or 12pt or whatever. \r\n\r\ngreetings\r\n\r\nPS\r\nDo you know DTL Documenta
    or TEFF Lexicon (both are expensive!)? Both are extremely legible and good looking
    faces. I'm not a big fan of AGaramond (surely i'm a minority here), if it comes
    to Garamond, i prefer, \"the more rough\" Stempel Garamond or as i mentioned,
    the more formal, Sabon \u2013 anyway. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "poms, I agree with a lot of what you're saying. I should have also mentioned
    that it's not just the size that bothers me, but also very much the typeface.
    \r\n\r\nAGaramond is just too bland for me and I want a typeface that has a little
    character to it that sneaks up on you when reading it. I want our readers to want
    to immediately dive into the text without hesitation, and while reading it (or
    even after) there can be a letter or number or something that they notice and
    momentarily think to themselves, \"oh that's neat/nice/interesting\" and then
    move on effortlessly in reading. Obviously it also neds to have it's own personality
    so there's the subtle acknowledgment that they know they are reading our magazine.\r\n\r\nI
    adhered to most of Bringhurst's rules when setting the type. I have the copy set
    for 2, 3 and 4 columns of text. I'm also switching to left justified. I have my
    settings at 80/100/120% for allowable/preferred/maximum in InDesign. I'd also
    love some advice for setting left justified text a better way though. I think
    I might be missing a few things.\r\n\r\npoms, I'll check out Sabon again (looked
    at it before, it didn't grab me the first time), as well as DTL Documenta and
    TEFF Lexicon, but if they're that expensive then they may not be an option for
    me."

  body: "Michael, I think your boss is basically right about too small type, and you
    should listen to him. If I'm doing the math right, 10 pt Adobe Garamond has about
    the same x height as 8.5 point Times New Roman. \r\n\r\nKevin Larson, reading
    scientist at Microsoft, mentioned here on Typophile what seems to be a reasonably
    good, if old, test which found that most people prefer to read at 11 point. [I
    think it was book type, but I'm not sure.] David Berlow mentioned a recent survey
    of newspaper readers which gave a range of 8-11 point. Now both these surveys
    are of limited use as they don't refer to x-height, which is the more significant
    issue. \r\n\r\nAnd they don't mention other important variables. For example,
    roughly speaking if you have a shorter measure and more leading, smaller type
    is more readable than at longer measure and less leading. \r\n\r\nIn sum, I would
    suspect that 10 point AGaramond is only going to work even passably in a narrow,
    multi-column setting, similar to Times at 8.5 point. \r\n\r\nAlso with Times at
    8.5 point you are starting to push the lower limits of readability, which is going
    to be more of a problem for older readers. \r\n\r\nThe blanket advice 'use 12
    point' is ignorance speaking, as 12 point may well be too big, depending on other
    factors. But if 'Make It Bigger' (title of Paula Scher's book) is the usual amateur
    mistake, I think that making it too small is a common designer mistake. The reason
    is that the white space is going to free you to make your design look better.
    But try reading it! \r\n\r\nThe age factor is also important, depending on the
    age of your readers. Here from a web site on newspaper design:\r\n\r\n\"The aging
    of newspaper readers has been cause for concern for experts like Mario Garcia,
    who has redesigned more than 450 newspapers worldwide during the last 25 years.
    'I now use 10 point text uniformly on all projects, knowing that we have an increasing
    number of baby boomers who need reading glasses, and they are likely to be readers
    for another 30 years or so.'\"\r\n\r\nNote that Garcia was talking about newspaper
    type, like Times, with a large x-height. So if you are talking about Times at
    10 point, you are talking Abobe Garmond at probably 11.5 point. Which to my old
    eyes sounds like something I would be happy with! \r\n\r\nps. The 18 point plus
    stuff for those with seriously vision impaired is very important, but it doesn't
    apply to normal aging, without any special problems. "

  body: "I hear ya William, and I'm slowly coming around to the same conclusion. However,
    I'm not one of those designers who loves small type, because I don't and I think
    readability is the first priority here. My goal was to make it more \"normal-sized\"
    type. The way the magazine was set before I came on board was more on the amaturish
    side but that may not have had as much to do with the type size as I originally
    thought. I'm re-evaluating the margins, gutter widths, and yes of course leading
    and word spacing.\r\n\r\nI might be able to live at 10 point text for now, but
    I'll have to continue to tweak the other settings as well. I think my biggest
    problem with the whole scenario is everyone else's (at work, not here) closed-mindedness
    to hearing that there are other factors that affect readability besides type size.\r\n\r\nI
    think I can keep Bembo, which has slightly thinner lines than AGaramond, and will
    help me not have such bulky looking body copy. I will be looking at going to a
    different font eventually though."

    look elegant, I agree, but they can be hard to read at small sizes. Remember that
    font size is relative, Perpetua for example is kind of tiny and you'd need to
    set it at 11 points to match most 10 point fonts. \r\n\r\nI'd suggest you find
    a body font that has a slightly higher x-height and perhaps a more condensed shape
    and then add some lead. You'll satisfy the older folks (I know about this, I had
    a boss for years that always wanted the type bigger for his tired eyes, and then
    I remember showing my portfolio to an art director who asked me why I always used
    such large type) and maintain an elegant airy feel.\r\n\r\nDante is a nice font
    that has a higher x-height. Sabon, Columbus, Electra, Spectrum are all nice too."

  body: If you settle on Bembo, and the budget allows for it, look at Bembo Book which
    is available in OT and was redone to more closely approach the warmth of metal
    Monotype Bembo. Given what you have said above, you may prefer the thinner, lighter
    color of the older digital Bembo but for me  the new Bembo Book is much easier
    to read as text type. In all the years that digital Bembo existed, I actually
    never used it -- seemed too anemic to me -- so it was use metal or choose some
    other PostScript face. Now that the Bembo Book is out I'm much happier.

    it now. I think I may have to go back to a heavier typeface after all.\r\n\r\nBruce:\r\nAs
    you read above, I think I may not settle on Bembo after all. The thinner, lighter
    color of the font may be what's hindering readability for me. I'll be looking
    at justification, hyphens, and leading as factors as well though. <strong>But</strong>,
    if I stick with Bembo then I'd definitely try to pitch Bembo Book since it does
    look like it was better designed for text."
