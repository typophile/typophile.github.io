  body: "This is what a Futura Hairline weight might look like - though the zero looks
    like it was born as an \"O\".\r\nNot sure if anyone makes such a typeface.\r\n\r\nAnother
    direction might be [[http://www.incipit.com/typefaces.html|L&C Hairline]] - not
    sure how you would get that either."

  body: "I thought this might be a free font called [[http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=caviar_dreams&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=SHOES+AND+BOOTS+M+W&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha|Caviar
    Dreams]]. Some letters are very similar but others are way off, plus your sample
    is probably thinner than the thin weight.\r\n\r\nIt also looks like a simple,
    geometric alphabet I have in a traditional British signpainting manual from the
    '80s that was meant to be drawn with large-size compass and set square. I'll find
    the name of that which might help if you need to draw something like this yourself."
