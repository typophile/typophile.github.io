  was founded in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1985 by [[Greg Kolodziejzyk]], and used
  direct marketing to sell fonts, clip art, and photos for desktop publishing.\r\n\r\nIn
  1991, Image Club developed their own [[PostScript]] to [[TrueType]] conversion utility
  called [[Evolution]] and used it to move their entire library to the new font format.\r\n\r\nIn
  1994 the company was aquired by Aldus Corporation, which in turn merged later that
  year into Adobe Systems of California.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 Adobe rebranded Image Club
  as [[Adobe Studios]], which subsequently became the independant [[EyeWire]] after
  a management buyout. In 1999, EyeWire was acquired by Getty Images and later absorbed
  into the realm of the mothership. Finally in 2003 the Image Club library along with
  the EyeWire domain name was acquired by Fonts.com, who are now the exclusive distributors
  for the fonts. The Image Club clip art collection, as well as the remaining vestiges
  of the EyeWire stock imagery line, is still owned and distributed by Getty Images
  through various third party resellers.\r\n\r\n[[Grant Hutchinson]] was one of many
  designers who created original typeface designs for the Image Club library. Others
  included [[Patricia Lillie]], [[Jean McAllister]], [[Laurie McCanna]], [[Cathy Larson]],
  [[Ty Semaka]], [[Calvin Glenn]], [[Dean Stanton]], [[Noel Rubin]], [[Michael Allard]],
  and [[Lorne Maclean]].\r\n\r\nComment: <cite>\"I lived through all these changes...
  wish Image Club would still be around.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nGrant replies: <cite>\"It
  was a wild ride, to be sure. Image Club lives on... in my basement, on my hard drives,
  and at <a href=\"http://www.imageclub.org/\">this site</a> - which will eventually
  become a historical document of the company and the people who worked there.\"</cite>"
