  not looking for those cheesy ones you see for restaurants, I want something that
  looks like its from the 1500s-1800s\r\n\r\nThere was a logo on logopond that had
  a great one they used, but I lost the link for it "

    of sans serif dates around 1745 as of Caslon foundry. \r\nNot sure Spaniards have
    created sans-serif fonts. Try google it, your post will be first result. \r\n\r\nDo
    you have any example similar to what you want?\r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"

    Types</em></a> shows mostly blackletter, serif and italic faces during this period.

  body: "How about Mario Feliciano's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/feliciano/rongel/|Rongel]]?
    It was recognized by Typographica in 2004. This one is an interpretation off an
    1800's type catalog. Probably better to have a design that has been expertly interpreted,
    than a live-scanned knock-off. I think D.B. Updike would think so, anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    live scanned. I did look at the typerepublic typefaces and they look well designed,
    and the fact that they are designed by a Spaniard does make them Spanish. However,
    I don't think that they are dissimilar enough from other modern faces to fit the
    Spanish look that Phillip is looking for\u2014the kind that D.B. Updike talks
    about in [[http://books.google.com/books?id=c4EsAAAAYAAJ&dq=Daniel%20Berkeley%20Updike&pg=RA2-PA86-IA13#v=onepage&q=&f=false|Printing
