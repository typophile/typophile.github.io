    <BR>But in any case, in a revival credit should be formally and publicly given
    to the original. The thing is, there&#39;s no reason to assume Rocky wouldn&#39;t
    give credit, except of course if you&#39;re a gestapo who sees people as criminals

    <BR>BTW, Peignot has a depth few people acknowledge. <BR> <BR>Vox: Haven&#39;t
    read much - try JFP&#39;s site. <BR> <BR>Excoffon: Considering that he had a surprisingly
    analytical approach to type design &#40;even though he was mostly a display boy&#41;,
    not to mention his flamboyant lifestyle, it&#39;s surprising there isn&#39;t more
    about him. One good place is S Carter&#39;s incomparable &#34;20th Century Type

  body: ' BTW, I forgot to tell this story: <BR> <BR>Excoffon worked for Fondrie Olive,
    the only main French rival of Deberny &amp; Peignot. Cassandre was finishing his
    Peignot for D&amp;P when Excoffon came to visit. Upon seeing Cassandre&#39;s drawings,
    Excoffon quickly took the first train back home and drew an imitation. And it
    was released &#42;before&#42; Peignot. Excoffon&#39;s imitation didn&#39;t adopt
    Cassandre&#39;s reformist efforts, however, so it actually sold better too...
    <BR> <BR>BTW, this incident was actually one of the main catalysts for the foundation
    of ATypI. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    think D&amp;P was already committed to Peignot, and it was a later design of his
    &#40;IIRC something more Greek-lapidary, possibly his &#34;Metop&#34;?&#41; that
    was rejected by an unnamed German font house that did it. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Cassandre
    wasn&#39;t so distressed over just a simple case of font licensing. He was beside
    himself with grief because nobody took his alphabet reform efforts to heart, even
    taking his work, stripping out the reform, and selling it like hotcakes. &#40;BTW,
    in my case I&#39;m fortunate to be able to squarely blame you guys for being so

  body: ' Personal-use and possession laws vary from state to . . . Oh, wait a minute,
    we&#39;re talking about fonts here. Scratch that. <BR> <BR>Seriously though, Hrant
    is right about any copyright expiring. Setting aside the whole issue of whether
    typefaces are covered under U.S. law, the longest term of protection offered under
    U.S. copyright is 75 years. So anything older is in the public domain. Less than
    75 years and you&#39;ll have to research. <BR> <BR>I would not consider digitizing
    images from the 1923 ATF book for personal use as pirating -- especially a design
    which is not currently available in any other way.  <BR> <BR>If you want to turn
    your scans into a useable font, then there&#39;s always Streamline and Fontographer.
    But, if you&#39;re thinking of trying to set a decent paragraph of text, then
    you&#39;re in for a bit of work to get the font really up to snuff. You won&#39;t
    get professional outlines from a tracing program. You won&#39;t get good spacing
    from an auto routine. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, if you just want to set a headline,
    then skip the font. Set your letters manually. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. '

    the US. Selling it can be harder depending on the design. Proceed with caution.
    <BR> <BR>As for the technical question, which was &#40;I believe&#41; the original
    question, buy ScanFont fron FontLab. I digitized a whole character set &#40;in
    my case J.M. Fleischmann&#39;s Groote Canon Duits from 1748&#41; inside of a weekend.
    It&#39;s amazingly intelligent. And that one I did with the three-day demo version,
    which led me to then purchase the full version. Worth every penny! I use it in
    conjunction with FontLab, but you can also use it with the cheaper TypeTool. '
