body: Goran's post about the note just brought a question for me. I'm working on a
  titling font that has Caps and smallcaps, the smallcaps taking the place of lowercase.
  What would the proper height be for the exclamdown character. I wondered if it should
  just be at the same cap level as the regular exclamation point. The smallcaps are
  a bit taller than what a lowercase would likely be. I suppose it would be possible
  to have one for before small caps and one before caps, but that might look awkward
  if both were seen in proximity.

    you are going to make a special exclam and question for \"all small caps,\" you
    need small cap \"downs\" as well. You will need the regular sized ones for cap-smallcap
    settings.\r\n\r\nAs we discussed on the Design Forum recently, the question of
    how to work the OT features depends on the applications programs capabilities,
    and how you expect the font to be used. But I would think that for a titling font,
    you can expect any reasonable comp to take some pains getting things right, so
    the toggling of features is less important."

  body: "Sorry Charles,\r\nI think I worded that wrong. I think the size should be
    the same. I was referring more to positioning. On the Microsoft standards site
    it say there are 2 ways.\r\n\r\n\"The inverted question and inverted exclamation
    have two possible alignments.\"\r\n\r\n\"X-height alignment : In most text fonts
    the inverted question and inverted exclamation tops align with the lowercase x-height.
    In a round design the lowercase x-height's overshoot. The bottom should not exceed
    the lowercase descender value. In this case many type designers use an uppercase
    alignment method or shorten and redesign the glyphs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uppercase alignment
    : This is a simple 180 degree rotation with no vertical offset from the position
    of the question and exclamation. Used very commonly in display fonts and modern
    designs.\"\r\n\r\nIt doesn't mention Smallcaps, but I'm inclined towards using
    the Uppercase alignment throughout.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Why don't you insert two exclamdowns. \r\nThe default one should have the
    same height as the small caps, while the other one \"exclamdown.case\" (applied
    via case-feature) should be as tall as the UC."

  body: "Spanish-speaking friends (well, editors) of mine say that preceding a capital
    letter, the exclamdown and questiondown should align at what you & Microsoft are
    calling the \"uppercase\" position. Preceding a lowercase letter, the \"x-height\"
    position can be used.\r\n\r\nAs Christoph says, I would have two for a Cap/smallcap
    display font. There will be people who will use only the small caps for a heading,
    and people who use Cap/smallcap."
