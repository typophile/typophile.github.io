  over the years.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to recreate a logo for a small mortgage company
  and I can't hit on the right combination of fonts for this one. I tried Indent-i-Font
  and the other three or four automated sites and they couldn't nail it either.\r\n\r\nThoughts?
  Thanks!\r\n\r\nGary\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just noticed the cap C isn't a 100% match, but the rest of the letterforms
    look like Palatino. Bitstream do a version of Palatino called Zapf Calligraphic
    I think, maybe the C is slightly different on that cut.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,
    Simon"

    may work well. The top of the lowercase \"l\" has a slight angle, but the lower
    \"a\" is right on. \r\n\r\nThanks for the help. I would consider this mystery
    solved!\r\n\r\nG"

    Both Meridien and Apollo were designed by [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/adrian+frutiger/fonts/|Adrian
    Frutiger]], but a casual look should show that they are not the same at all.\r\n\r\nMeridien
    italic looks very close, but the C is wider in your sample than in the font.\r\n\r\n-
