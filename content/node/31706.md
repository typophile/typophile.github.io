  body: 'Typophile started regularly appearing in Google searches around October/November
    2006, and since then has constantly appeared near or at the very top of most Google
    searches on typography and related items. Before last fall I''m not sure that
    I had ever even heard of Typophile, now it comes up in every related search I
    run. I imagine that most of the other students are finding out about Typophile
    like I did; it comes up when doing a research projects. '

    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/search/\">Search</a> (or Google's alternative 'site:typophile.com
    typeyourwordhere') and the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/\">Wiki</a>. And
    I think it's a good idea to lurk around for some time and know your bearings,
    before you start posting."

    anyone have stats on how many lurkers there are on average? Like right now there
    are 48 users and 1497 guests! Is that a typo? Or is that normal?"
