body: This is my second go around with typeface design. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m halfway done
  with it, putting it up for some early feedback.  It&#39;ll be a monoface.   <BR>
  <BR>I think I like the way the stroke of the &#39;r&#39; ends and I&#39;ll probably
  make the &#39;g&#39; &#39;m&#39; &amp; &#39;n&#39;look and feel like the &#39;r&#39;.
  <BR> <BR>The &#39;y&#39; is rough, i&#39;m having problems with it. <BR> <BR>I do
  realize this name is probably taken, but i like it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8430.jpg"
