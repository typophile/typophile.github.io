body: I have a logo of a lighthouse with words across the font of it.  Lighthouse
  made in illustrator and words as well. Whenever I bring the logo into a word doc
  there is a white box around the logo. i did a clipping mask eps file and brought
  it in - that worked. But is there a way to bring a jpeg or tiff file into word of
  the same logo. How would I do this in photoshop.???

  body: You can do <strong>File > Save for web and devices</strong> to save the eps
    as a jpg or png or gif. Do you have to use it in Word? Could you use InDesign
    instead?

  body: "Is it for a letterhead? To make the image a background image, you can do
    <strong>View > Header and Footer</strong> then <strong>Insert > Picture > from
    file . . .</strong> choose the logo file you want to use (pngs work best for word
    I think) and then click ok. \r\n\r\nThen to get the image to go behind text you
    right click on the image in the document and click <strong>Format Picture . .
    .</strong>. That will bring up a window where you can edit how the file is displayed
    in the word doc \u2014 size, layout, etc.\r\n\r\nHope that info helps.\r\n\r\nI
    hate Word.\r\n\r\n-\r\n<em>penn</em>"

  body: "JPG does not support transparency. There is an updated JPG-2000 which does,
    but it's barely adopted. GIF supports transparency, but lacks quality. So, the
    choice is to use PNG.\r\n\r\nIn IL CS4 you have the option File > Save for MS
    Office. It saves your artwork as a 24-bit PNG with transparent background. The
    same could be achieved through the command penn.and.ink indicated. Just check
    if the transparency is enabled and be sure your background is removed:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PNGtransparency_5510.PNG]"
