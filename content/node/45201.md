  body: "I have the collection of Font Diner fonts that were sent to me very generously
    by Stuart Sandler, so that I could make samples for the Script Font ID Guide.
    I still have to make samples of these two, but I will try to do them in a few
    minutes and point you to them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
