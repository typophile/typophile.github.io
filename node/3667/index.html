  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My agency is developing a visual identity for a swedish university college of film, radio, television and theatre. <BR> <BR>Right now different designers are exploring different solutions, my idea is basically to design a typeface with a set of special ligatures and icons, as the schools identity.  <BR> <BR>Initial inspiration has come from Meta Designs work for Glasgow and Matthew Carters for Walker Art Institute. <BR> <BR>But I thought, <i>maybe ze Typophiles can assist me as well</i>? <BR> <BR>So, what I&#39;m asking for is icon suggestions. <BR> <BR>The obvious ones should represent Radio, Film, TV and, er, Theatre.  <BR>I can see two ways to deal with this; either with the archetypic, generic symbols &#40;the theatre one with the happy and sad mask&#41; or a more original, yet <i>highly stylized</i> approach. I think both are fine, but they should all be on the same abstraction level. <BR> <BR>Next to those symbols, it&#39;s an open question; what else could I need? More to the point, what do <i>they</i> need? Obviously I&#39;ll ask them as well, but still. I think you&#39;re all capable to contribute. <BR> <BR>They&#39;re moving to a new building &#40;It has been built exclusively for them&#41;, so a Building-icon is on its way, signage signs such as arrows could be handy, maybe toilet signs as well. OK, the list could go on, but I would really appreciate some input. <BR> <BR>The stage is yours. <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you should consider having one &#34;umbrella&#34; symbol to tie everything together, and use a secondary symbol -or maybe acronyms- to differetiate everything. Consider making the umbrella symbol a set of three or four concentric arcs of a circle &#40;you know, like on a volume button&#41;, meaning something like &#34;to broadcast&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Fachhochschule Wiesbaden in Germany has a logo for each department, as well as an umbrella logo for the college. Their CI is Meta, I think. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m almost certain that Werner Schneider had a hand in their design. In any event, he taught their forever before retiring a few years ago. His Vialog from Linotype also has a symbol set, designed with f&uuml;nfwerken. But that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the school &#40;although it is in the same style&#41;. Vialog, and some of its symbols were designed for the Munich Transportation Authority, which now has a kick-&#149;&#149;&#149; navigation/identity system as well. <BR> <BR>Linotype Vialog <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/43576/vialogltsigns-family.html" target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/43576/vialogltsigns-family.html</a> <BR> <BR>F&uuml;nfwerken <BR><a href="http://www.fuenfwerken.de/" target="_blank">http://www.fuenfwerken.de/</a> <BR> <BR>FH Wiesbaden &#40;unfortunately, the school website does not have a clear description of its identity system on its website, that I know of&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.fh-wiesbaden.de" target="_blank">http://www.fh-wiesbaden.de</a> <BR> <BR>Munich Transportation Authority <BR><a href="http://www.mvg-mobil.de/" target="_blank">http://www.mvg-mobil.de/</a></div>
