  body: Cristian, I like it!  I think there are a few issues others will mention,
    but I&#39;d just suggest that those neat angled serifs should be a little thicker,
    and maybe at a less harsh angle. <BR> <BR>Me gusto el ligatura &#34;che&#34;!

  body: 'I like the relation of the name and the descendents-ascendents, but i think
    that you can take more adventage of this with this &#34;broken angle&#34;, put
    it on the @, the end of n, m, and upper case Q &amp; R &#40;trust me, seriously&#41;but
    mostly well done. <BR> <BR>I like this face, and i use it as display, with long
    animated ascendents &amp; descents, just like on the opening film of the planet
    of the apes......but with some pink elephants... <BR> <BR>well forget this last

  body: Nice font. <BR>I agree with Paul about the angled serifs, they need to be
    thicker for the smaller sizes. When I look at &#34;t&#34; at small size the serif
    and the crossbar seem too close. Less angle as Paul suggested? <BR>I love the
    &#34;ch&#34; ligature. <BR> <BR>The uppercase &#34;G&#34; could use a more rounded
    botom to meet the stem. &#40;like the lower case &#34;g&#34;&#41; That would keep
    uniformity. <BR> <BR>Can you set some copy in small size? PDF? I just want to
    see how the serifs work. <BR> <BR>very nice face overall. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Bren
