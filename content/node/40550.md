  I did an independent study this past semester on typeface design because no professor
  at my school teaches it and I wanted to try it.\r\n\r\nThis was the result. I was
  wondering if you guys wouldn\u2019t mind critiquing it. I built it in illustrator
  because I haven\u2019t the slightest idea about anything that professional type
  designers use. I used some rulers and built some tools out of boxes that i thought
  were quite resourceful but I don\u2019t know if I even did the right thing once
  and not everything is exact because I wasn\u2019t sure where to even start that.\r\n\r\nThe
  books I tried to use were: Karen Cheng\u2019s \u201CDesigning Type\u201D and \u201CThe
  Art of Calligraphy\u201D By David Harris because it had all different written alphabets
  including the fraktur.\r\n\r\nI based it off of my own letterforms of the fraktur
  but it went in some different directions. There are a lot of things that interest
  me and disturb me and I don\u2019t know how to fix them.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n[[http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2074/2165307545_ed6f38079b_o.png]]"

  body: "Hey Charles, welcome to Typophile. I'm an '02 KU grad, CD of course. I'm
    not surprised to hear that there isn't anyone available to help you professionally
    at the school. My impressions were that it's a formula teaching school, not a
    concept learning school. So anything outside the curriculum is often approached
    as a independent study. A fellow student (Nicki Stager) had attempted to do a
    type face of her own as an independent study. She worked with Todd McFeely, who
    isn't exactly a type professional by any means, but he might be worth approaching.\r\n\r\nAs
    for your work, it looks remarkable. You might want to try and create characters
    that aren't pieced together from other characters and some that are a single stroke,
    not a combination of multiple strokes (it's starting to look like a stencil version
    Fraktur.) Your line thickness is consistent, which is good, and your curves are
    elegant. \r\n\r\nYou'll also need to consider spacing between the letters, I'd
    open it up a little, these seem a bit tight and with the broken look, make the
    letters blend together too much.\r\n\r\nWould you mind attaching your images using
    the \"insert image\" link on this site. You can add it to the original post if
    you click on edit and then insert image. This will help preserve the history of
    the post if something should ever happen to your Flickr page, or if you remove
    the image for the page.\r\n\r\nGood luck, this looks awesome and I would love
    to see what becomes of it. Are you planning to do uppercase letters or numbers
    also? "

  body: "Thanks for your compliments!\r\n\r\nI was happy with the support I got from
    The professor that oversaw my project (It was Karen Kresge) but it was new territory
    for the both of us and we both were guessing at solutions. I wasn't aware that
    Prof. Mcfeely did this before otherwise I would have asked him to oversee it for
    sure.\r\n\r\nI tried to attatch it as an image with the insert image but it said
    there was an error so that's why i posted the link. I will keep trying to get
    it on there.\r\n\r\nI think you are right about the pieces. When \x10I began it
    I thought part of the concept would be that my counters were open and that you
    could stencil it if you wanted so I broke it at each thin stroke. Now that I look
    at it I can see how the letters could curve better If they were fluid along those
    lines so I'm going to try that. also the f and the t (the only solid characters)
    seem very heavy and rigid to me and the t I feel doesn't fit the rest of the letters
    yet.\r\n\r\nI was trying to find the common strokes in the letter and use them
    to assemble the other letters. not out of laziness but because i thought it was
    correct. The y I know Is a disapointment In that regard I think I'm going to go
    back to the original shape if closing these gaps helps...\r\n\r\nI would love
    to do the uppercase and numbers to really finish it off but I think i still have
    a lot of work here yet. I can't do it quickly yet so be patient for an update...\r\n\r\nThanks
    again"

    so it doesn't seem to formulaic.\r\n\r\nIf you want to continue with blackletter
    you should pick up \"Blackletter: Type and National Identity\" by Peter Bain and
    Paul Shaw:\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=E4c3sJhNVqkC\r\nhttp://www.cooper.edu/art/lubalin/bletter.html"

  body: "It's a very nice beginning. I basically like Fraktur and just used it in
    a project. A decent program to create a font in is Fontographer: http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/
    \ and it works somewhat like Illustrator but it lets you test strings of characters
    and put in spacing \u2013 which is the second part of font design. But i would
    also close those characters and heavy up the hairlines in the \"e\" and the \"z\"
    just a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/matt3_3610.jpg]"

  body: "The first things that stand out is that some of the character shapes follow
    other blackletter/antiqua styles, although to good effect.  Specifically those
    are the lowercase K, and X.  The K is normally based off the L, as you have it,
    but with a stroke the same height as the bar in the F, and an additional stroke
    above.  Certainly more readable to the modern reader how you have it, but I just
    point it out depending on your exact goal.  The R is often the basis for the X,
    simply with a tail.  Again, your version is far more readable, but depending on
    your goal...\r\n\r\nI really like the ascender terminals in the lowercase B, K,
    L, and H.  The descender on the Y I think could be a little bit more curvy, it
    seems too straight.  Often times the Y is more based on the H, but with an ascending
    left stem.  I tried copying and pasting your H descender to the Y, but since you
    have a relatively short descender on it it doesn't fit the style at all on the
    Y.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt your second Z is better.  The swash is great in the
    first one but just doesn't fit the letter for me.  It would make a nice swash
    for hyphens or other such things though.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea
