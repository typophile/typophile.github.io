  produce a opentype font. Everything is fine apart form this output I get when I
  compile the opentype features.\r\n\r\n<XXX-Light> Start of new pair positioning
  subtable; some pairs may never be accessed: [Y Yacute Ycircumflex Ydieresis] [agrave
  aacute acircumflex atilde adieresis aring amacron abreve] [WORK:Applications:FontLab
  4.5:fontlab.fea 114]\r\n\r\nI've checked the classes to make sure there is no duplications,
  and the kerning for the key glyph. The kerning seems to be working fine, so I carn't
  work out what's causing this output.\r\n\r\ns."

    rightside/leftside flags for kern classes right in the classes panel).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    neither of them would free you of setting up kern classes correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    We\u2019re not issuing any free updates for FontLab 4.5 or 4.6 anymore. Even though
    they did help in some matters, these versions of the software are still behind
    the current font format needs. Especially if you\u2019re making OpenType fonts,
    I\u2019d definitely consider upgrading to FontLab Studio 5, since previous versions
    of FontLab simply did not completely fulfill the \"best practice\" recommendations
    for OpenType fonts. Unfortunately, the reality of OpenType for the last 2-3 years
    has been that the OpenType specification has been frozen and a lot of un- or underdocumented
    fixes and recommendations were issued by Adobe and Microsoft. FontLab Studio 5
    takes these into account. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
