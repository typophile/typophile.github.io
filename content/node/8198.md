  body: Nathan don&#39;t crash the type the UTI combination in Solutions, and the
    NI in Volcanic is auful. Then you have a river of space between the RI in Risk.
    Start over with the type. <BR> <BR>Please explain the graphic. I don&#39;t see
    how it makes the name any clearer. You might suggest a tag line to explain the
    nature of the business. Is it an insurance company?

  body: The logo seems random, like it could be MS clipart. I don&#39;t think the
    graphic is memorable.

  body: 'To &#40;vaguely&#41; quote Einstein: <i>things should be made a simple as
    possible, but no simpler.</i> <BR> <BR>This design is an abundance of lines and
    forms, any message loses itself in the forest of visuality. <BR> <BR>It does remind
    me somewhat of the seismographic symbol for earthquakes, though. But then again,
    that&#39;s not vulcanic.'

  body: 'I wonder if you  could create a nice, primarily typographic solution using
    the &#34;seismic&#34; lines as random, supporting graphic elements. What I mean
    by &#34;random&#34; is not necessarily appearing exactly the same on any pieces.
    This randomness can represent the often unpredictable nature of volcanos &#40;e.g.
    the recent activity of Mt. St. Helens&#41;. <BR> <BR>1 The logo could be a simple
    typographical logo, presented with or without the graphic lines, or with a few
    variations of the lines. <BR> <BR>2 The bizcard could present the graphic lines
    in one way, while they might appear differently on letterhead and envelopes. <BR>
    <BR>3 Other printed collateral could present the graphic lines in various ways:
    large, small, cropped left, cropped right, etc. <BR> <BR>4 etc'

  body: My problem is I don&#39;t get the business model. Is it a free service or
    a commercial organization. Is it Insurance or Information? Why a logo at all?
    Nathan?
