  for that. The light looks very familiar also, and I know I've seen it a thousand
  times, but I'm having a hard time placing it. Can anyone help? I actually have to
  use this ugly thing in a brochure so I have to recreate it somehow :(\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nhttp://istservice.com/Images/iqvideo/iqlogo.jpg"
