  target="_blank">Corporate S</a> from Berthold Types. Yes? I&#39;m wondering if anyone
  knows of a suitable replacement. I feel awful putting it that way. Oh, the guilt!
  I know that once you do the math it is only $20 per font, but ... well ... any ideas?
  Is someone else licensing this typeface for less? '

  body: I may understand you, Tiffany, I always loved the look of &#39;Corporate A&#39;
    &#40; the serif one &#41;.. <BR>&#40; So, Maybe i am just going to save some more
    money, and buy it, in the, hopefully near, future.. &#41; <BR> <BR>But, of course,
    I am thankful for any cheaper licenses, links and hints, too.. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    awkward.

    glyphs based on the &#34;golden cut&#34;. I love those faces especially the lc
    g,  <BR>the corpo A small caps and the whole corpo E.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done
    some work for daimler chrysler and used the urw-version of corporate.  <BR>this
    version has a few bugs and its badly screen optimized.  <BR> <BR>corporate A ntiqua
