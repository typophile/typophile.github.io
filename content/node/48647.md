  body: "I think I know what the problem is.\r\n\r\nIndeed FF Trixie is large, but
    this isn't the HD version.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to embed larger character sets
    into the SWFs so that thread titles using siFR can render more characters, especially
    diacritics and such. The downside is larger files.\r\n\r\nBut it isn't working
    anyway, so we'll try something else :("

    SWFs are somewhere between 300-500k when they should be about 15-30k.\r\n\r\nNot
    a whole lots we can do except change the font.\r\n\r\nSorry Trixie!"
