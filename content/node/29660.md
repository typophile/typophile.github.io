  body: "<a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/\">Courier Sans</a> from lineto.com in the
    category textfonts. \r\n\r\nAnd your feeling about being pretty common or being
    a system font was quite right. \r\n\r\nQuote: \"Courier Sans was originally designed
    in 1994 during the first year of my graphic design degree (\u2026). By taking
    the mac system font and cutting off the serifs, a pleasantly anonymous and functional
    yet somehow stylish sans serif was created. I received a 3rd for the exercise,
    but was able to refute accusations of rule-breaking with the answer: Ah, but you
    see: it\u2019s Courier SANS!\""
