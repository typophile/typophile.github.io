  body: "Very similar to an old Art Nouveau design called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/roberta/|Roberta]].In
    looking through the Solotype catalog (p.45), this looks like a heavier weight
    (or flattened) version of a typeface called Elefante, but I do not know of a digital
    version offhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
