  San Serif.  Doesn't have to be hand drawn looking, though that would be awesome,
  just something that is condensed, thin, and has similar letterforms.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ex_5024.gif]"

  body: "thanks.  Orator is similar as well.  Would love someone to make this into
    an open type that plays off the inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Parachute's cut of DIN comes pretty close, the 'F' being the only major difference.
    You should check out [[http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/PE10253.cfm|PF
    Din Text Compressed Pro Extra Thin]]. It has a bit more character than the FontShop
    version.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DIN_4058.jpg]"
