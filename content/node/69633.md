  to create campaigns with huge sans-serif lettering, hyphenated to the point of illegibility.\"\r\n\r\nSee
  here:\r\nhttp://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_file.asp?individual_id=212054&portfolio_id=3593856\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for examples of this--I know I've seen it everywhere, but I can't pull up
  any campaign or company in specific at this moment.\r\n\r\nAlso curious what other
  people think about the practice, and if there are instances of it being used well,
  or not."

    word length, such as German, where it may simply be necessary (and is also maybe
    less frowned upon; not that it is necessarily considered pretty).\r\nOf course
    it's necessary to consider what to hyphenate where and how, but I don't think
    hyphenation is generally something that needs to be avoided."

  body: I think the whole idea behind it (at least the Gatorade ones) is playing off
    of what you're pointing out, evanbrog. This representation is confusing at first,
    thus it grabs our attention. We end up looking/reading/interpreting it more than
    just your average poster, and that is the intent (I think.)

  body: "I suppose you're right, Steve. Well, you have to be. And not to disparage
    my country-folk too greatly, but let's face it--America (which is where I've seen
    a lot of this advertised) isn't the sharpest knife in the country drawer. There's
    still illiteracy. I imagine to those people this is really annoying--considering
    the words are not even breaking for syllabic nuances, just for visual effect.
    Plus, Gatorade doesn't even use the grammatical symbol for a line break--the hyphen.
    Good luck to our immigrants as well.\r\n\r\nCertainly debates over whether it
    works, who cares--it sells, won't be solved. Maybe Gatorade needs to grab my attention.
    But a booklet for \"Commercial Opportunities for Museums and Cultural Institutions?\"
    I digress somewhat, maybe the title \"Intelligent Naivety\" does it for the same
    reason I did. But I'm positive there are many more examples out there that have
    done this just because it's trendy, as Don put it."
