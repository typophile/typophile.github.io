		<div class="commentbody">Ok. <BR> <BR>The Revival that i am talking about, is based on Garamond, but i think that we need new fonts that works on screen as good as in print, so with the respect of the typographic tradition, i try to do my best. Please visit the critique/bitmap text area, the typography is called &#34;Garadot&#34;. <BR> <BR>The true spirit of the original metal type was exist only on the pass by the punchcutters, and i am only trying to discovers the limits on bitmap fonts designs ;&#41; ...so the cleaning reading of every type means a little of Universality. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments <BR> <BR>MH</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; do you Think that Garamond is French because you know it was Produced in France? <BR> <BR>Good question. And of course I can&#39;t really know the answer: a system can never understand itself. <BR> <BR>I think there are two levels of knowledge, conscious and subconscious, with the latter being more shallow and inconstant, but more forceful. The fact that I consciously know that Garamond is of French origin ruins any possible subconscious appreciation. Fortunately for laymen &#40;readers&#41; they don&#39;t know the background, so the type can have a deeper association with social/national/ethnic context. Do laymen associate Garamond with French culture? My point is that they do, if only to a limited extent. What about Peignot? Very much. <BR> <BR>&#62; Even the most neutral typefaces have something to say. <BR> <BR>What does FF Kievit have to say? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In regards to the &#34;do laymen associate Garamond with France?&#34; <BR> <BR>While I am aware of Garamond originating in France, in comparison to you all, I&#39;m probably more a layman than not. However, Garamond does not scream vive France to me...  <BR> <BR>This topic is fascinating... I am aware of typefaces countries of origin and I have made some possibly stereotypical connections -- those Scandanavians and their clean, lovely sans serifs!!!  And maybe, just maybe, I thought Europeans were a bit more fond of sans serifs than Americans. <BR> <BR>But most of all, I thought there was a pantheon of great typefaces that stood up over time and popular the world over, Garamond among them along with Goudy, Helvetica, Times...  maybe type is better at conveying a time as opposed to a place...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a French Secam VHS video from French TV where they ask people on the streets what they associate with some particularly fonts composed always with same word George: fonts are Arepo, Champion &#40;one from Boltana, a Copperplate&#41;, Kosmik, Skia, Le Monde masterhead font &#40;the only black letter I have at hand&#41;. <BR> <BR>The answer has been &#40;various but the main idea is there by the majority&#41;: Grec yogurt, Men fashion/perfum, Camembert, Trash/fun young, and I miss the last one? Just try to put right font to right stuff as people in Paris streets. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Anyway, about country/typefaces, I will say that its more culture/typeface than anything else, and less and less possible to see anything, because the world became very small &#40;from 20th&#41;. And also until recently, most of fonts we fond on computers came from US-German-English companies with strong technical restrictions. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>To answer to miguel, the best to him, depending from where he came is to take some traditionnal typefaces from his country as starting point to do a revival.

It gets tricky for text face design, but that&#39;s just a matter of subtlety - never try to supress it, just let it flower in the right way.</i> <BR> <BR>i agree. thats preciously how it should be handled. influence should stream both ways, and in a harmless manner, so that &#40;for eg.&#41; the original hebrew letterforms wont be bruised too badly, and that israeli designers will make latin fonts that subtelty show their designer&#39;s background.  <BR>sometimes, though, there&#39;s not a choice for the designer. hebrew fonts with strong latin characteristics are in need now, and this need overpowers the need to preserve the original characteristics of hebrew.  <BR> <BR>thats how it looks to me, when i view the spectrum of hebrew fonts in israel today. <BR> <BR></div>

Some scripts &#40;like Arabic&#41; were made to give up more authenticity to foster material gain. Other scripts &#40;like Armenian&#41; have no problem with the mechanics, and become Latinized purely through misguided cultural idolatry. <BR> <BR>&#62; That has to count for something, doesn&#39;t it? <BR> <BR>Sure, I for one think so. <BR>It&#39;s just that different cultures are at a different point &#40;and they can learn from the past mistakes of others&#41;. For example, Greek type suffered rapine in the 70s &#40;mostly at the hands of its own people, if not always directly&#41;, but now it&#39;s coming into its own. Armenian type on the other hand went into &#34;degenerative Latinization&#34; about 10-15 years ago, and is still stuck there. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In Ireland the blame for the initial latinisation and eventual disappearence of Gaelic type lies squarely on the shoulders of the printers. Using Gaelic type wasn&#39;t technically complicated. Unfortunately it represented an extra cost. <BR> <BR>To increase their margins they put pressure on the government to do away with Gaelic type and make roman standard. The Government wanted the votes and, Bob&#39;s your uncle, no more Gaelic type.  <BR> <BR>Now that money is no longer a valid excuse, the printers claim that the reading public wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the exotic letterforms. <BR> <BR>Maybe one day the use of Gaelic fonts all over the world in texts about all things Irish might actually catch on in Ireland too. <BR> <BR>M <BR> <BR></div>
