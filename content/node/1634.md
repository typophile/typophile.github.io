  body: "I E-mailed Fidel Peugeot thanks to this thread. I contacted him because I
    was looking for a fashion editorial that featured a girl in a fur parka. It was
    either in SPRUCE or LINE, I couldn't remember which. (LINE & Spruce being 2 Wallpaper*
    spin-offs from the early 200's). \r\n\r\nI thought such a weird request would
    easily be ignored.\r\n\r\nBut guess what? He still has a copy of the first issue
    of LINE magazine! And snapped a pic!\r\n\r\nhttp://i48.tinypic.com/2d8kp35.jpg\r\n\r\nThat's
    right! The girl in the fur parka!"
