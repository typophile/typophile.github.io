  the first half of the 1900s.\r\n\r\nCan you please provide any resources where I
  can find these? Any specific IDs from these examples would be appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your assistance.\r\n\r\nJosh"

    get you started on a different collection:\r\nhttp://fontsinuse.com/uses/3836/re-publica-posters-since-1913\r\n\r\nIf
    you wanted to hunt down a little larger versions of some of them and post them
    a couple at a time, you may get some help."
