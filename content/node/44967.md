    you?\r\n\r\nIn the artist list the lower part is outside my viewport and there
    is no way to scroll down. I'm on a rather small screen (1024 by 768 px). \r\n\r\nAlso
    the scrollbar attacted to your content movie clip doesn't seem to work properly.
    You can scroll kinda far beyond the images."
