body: "HOUSE 33 TEMPORARY TYPE BOOKLET:\r\n\r\nFontworks co-sponsored the highly successful
  St Brides conference last month which had a theme of \"Temporary Type\". A brilliant
  full colour booklet was designed by House Industries specially for the conference
  and features the first season of lettering for their House33 clothing collaboration
  with fashion impresario Barnzley. If you're a House Industries fan you'll definitely
  want one of these! \r\n\r\nCopies of the limited edition booklet, which also features
  3 spreads by G-Type's Nick Cooke, are now available to buy (see link below) or are
  free of charge when ordering any House font pack (while stocks last).\r\n\r\nView
  images and read the mini Conference review:\r\nhttp://www.fontworks2.type.co.uk/fw/doc?d=public/stbride/temptype\r\nView
