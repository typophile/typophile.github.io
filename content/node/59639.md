  into this world!\r\n\r\nWas trying to find a font to match this typeset; seemingly
  no such luck.  The name of the type was \"Avil\" and I found it in the \"American
  Specimen Book of Type Styles\" from 1912. See attached image.  I'm doing research
  into older fonts to make myself a set of calling cards, and this one is a possibility.\r\n\r\nThis
  isn't the first type I came across in that book that has no modern font equivalent.
  \ That surprises me - I'd imagine they may not be patented and I'd think some enterprising
  soul would have created font sets based on all of them.  Has someone done this and
  I've missed it?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your help!\r\n\r\n--A"

  body: "Avil (Inland Type Foundry, 1904) was basically a version of Goudy's Pabst
    Oldstyle (ATF, 1902) but slightly narrower. Both were designs in a popular advertising
    vernacular of the time. \r\n\r\nInland eventually merged with ATF in 1912. I suspect
    that Pabst was the better seller at the time (Goudy being more \"name-brand\")
    and the two designs are so similar, ATF probably chose not to continue producing
    Inland's Avil. It doesn't show up in the 1923 specimen.\r\n\r\nBoth designs seem
    pretty anachronistic now.\r\n\r\nLanston Type Company (now a division of P22)
    offers a digital version of Goudy's [[http://www.p22.com/lanston/pabst.html|Pabst
    Oldstyle]]."

  body: "Thanks guys!  Kent, thanks for the link to P22 - they've got some great fonts
    there!  What I liked about Avil over Pabst was the seemingly taller ascenders.
    \ I found \"Nicolas Cochin\" to fill that gap, though on the P22 site.  Awesome!\r\n\r\nTipus,
    thanks for the book link.  If I get crazy enough I might buy some font software,
    scan the characters, and reproduce it.  I've been known to do stranger things
    - I picked up a NuArc Plate Burner a couple weeks ago!  =)  Fun stuff.\r\n\r\n--A"
