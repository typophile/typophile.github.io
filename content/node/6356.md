body: I am currently working on my dissertation that is exploring the relationship
  that Jan Tschichold and Peter Saville have/had with society. The main sources I
  have read for Tschichold are The New Typography and Kinross&#39; Modern Typography.
  <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any ideas for books and articles that I could locate on
  the Internet or Art School library.  I can find many contemporary sources on Saville
  however these are slightly lacking with Tschichold. <BR> <BR>All help is greatly
  appreciated. <BR> <BR>Kind Regards <BR> <BR>Stephen

  body: Hi Stephen -- <BR> <BR>Is there any particular reason you chose Tschichold
    and Saville? There&#39;s an interestingly stark contrast in their design philosophies.
    I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware the direct influence Tschichold had on particular
    Saville poster, designed for The Factory in &#39;78. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.designmuseum.org/designersimg/69_2Lg.jpg"
    target="_blank">http://www.designmuseum.org/designersimg/69_2Lg.jpg</a> <BR> <BR>I
    can&#39;t find an example online, but the inspiration is very clearly taken from
    a publicity leaflet of Tschischold&#39;s Die Neue Typographie. Perhaps it&#39;s
    in the book already linked?

  body: Cheers Luke <BR> <BR>Deliberatley chose Tschichold and Saville because of
    their different design philosophies. Covering the ideals of Modernism with Tshichold
    and Postmodernism with Saville. Tschichold initially came to my attention because
    of Saviles appropriation of his work in several pieces for Factory. <BR> <BR>Have
    you read Tschicholds&#39; The New Typography? I would strongly reccomend it. Written
    in 1928, but still very fresh.

    <BR>I&#39;ve yet to read The New Typography other than a few small chunks. It&#39;s
    one of those illusive books I keep meaning to get round to sooner rather than
    later. There are only so many hours in the day for reading. Currently burning
    through back issues of Idea and Emigr

  body: Yes - it has to be taken in its historical and cultural context, something
    that I am trying to examine in my disssertation. I know what you mean about the
    offensive - there&#39;s a particularly racist section that tells designers not
    to lower themselve to the level of indians. Tschichold dismissing the cultural
    heritage of an entire peoples at the drop of a hat. I can realte to other parts
    of the book though, I find his ideas, if sometimes wayward, brimming with enthusiasm.
    His idealist approach is a far cry from the &#39;laizze faire&#39; attitude of
    many contemporary designers. <BR> <BR>I might E-Mail you Dan, Luke and anyone
    else! -  at some point to ask you a couple of questions for my dissertation if
    that would be okay? <BR> <BR>Cheers, Stephen

    his progressive modernist ways to the later serifed and centered-classical-design
    stuff he did for Penguin Book? &#40; I think it was Penguin..&#41;

  body: In Tschichold&#39;s 1967 revision of <i>Die Neue Typographie,</i> he appologizes
    for the overly fascist tone that he took when originally writing it. Germany during
    the 1920s was a maelstrom of political activities, ideologies, and false righteousness.
    Tschichold was just as adamant about the new typography as the NSDAP was about
    their socio-political issues. In 1933, when Tschichold himself became a victim
    of government imposed backlashes again the avant garde &#40;suspected of communist
    sympathy&#41;, he got a taste of doctrinal rigidity first hand. <BR> <BR>Plus,
    while he was working in Britain &#40;during the war&#41;, he had the chance to
    work with traditional subject matters, and I think he personally fell in love
    with the seeped-in tradition of Monotype typography that was popular among book-printers
    of the day there. Maybe it just felt safe. <BR> <BR>After the war, Max Bill &#40;Dessau
    Bauhaus, then Z&uuml;rich, then the HfG Ulm&#41; accused Tschichold of apostasy
    for breaking with modernism, and Tschichold accused Bill of being too rigid for
    holding on so tightly. Paul Rand covers this nicely in one of his books.

  body: War and being pursecuted have a way of messing up your mind.  Maybe Tschichold
    was just longing for a gentler time.  <BR>While some here seem to protest against
    modernism for being too dogmatic, I think it is funny how there are posts here
    on Typophile which are dogmatically anti modernist.   <BR>All of these labels
    are just academic distinctions which we make for the convenience of discussion.  We
    should just take the entirety of Tschichold&#39;s work and enjoy it.  I wish he
    could have had the luxury of enjoying that difficult part of his life, perhaps
    he would have made an even different inroad into typography which we qould now
    have a new label for. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: 'From Norman Potter&#39;s <i>What is a designer</i> <BR> <BR>&#34;As Walter
    Gropius often explained, the modern movement was not some matter of dogma, fashion,
    or taste, but a profoundly wide-ranging attempt to encompass the nature of the
    twentieth-century experience and to meet its physical demands with a constructive
    response.&#34; &#40;p. 36&#41; <BR> <BR>Speaking of &#39;presentism&#39;, this
    is an interesting way to view a movement that&#39;s been sliced, diced, regurgitated
    and reinvented a million times, particularly by the Swiss-Modernist fetishism
    that hangs around some academic institutions in the US. There are many layers
    to examining modernist thought and work. And understanding some of the motives
    can lead to solutions and approaches that aren&#39;t set in Akzidenz Grotesk and
    bland as hell and don&#39;t seek to piggy-back on a pale echo of the modernist
    style. <BR> <BR>Tschichold was a very talented man, and he did what&#39;s being
    suggested in the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/48653.html?1095167946">Breaking
    into the industry</a> thread: he was being bold. I know much less about Saville,
    but I imagine there&#39;s a theme that could be explored along those lines.'
