body: thought I would just post my inprogress results for a font I&#39;m working on.
  <BR> <BR>So far, the capitals are drawn, but still need a bit of work. I&#39;m not
  sure about the S and the Q. <BR> <BR>I wanted to create a sans that had a bit more
  character than most geometric sans; included thick/thin strokes; and to have a &#39;fun&#39;
  and &#39;friendly&#39; feel. I took some inspiration &#40;esp the Q&#41; from Bookman.
  <BR> <BR>Let me know what you think! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56661.jpg"

  body: This font has many unusual quirks &#40;I like the unusual tail of the Q&#41;,
    but the overall design lacks a bit on consistency with regards weight and character
    widths. I would also suggest that you simplify it, besides fixing some of the
    forementioned issues.
