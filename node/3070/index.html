  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR> <BR>doing a job for a travel co offering holidays to Romania. <BR> <BR>The website is live (<a href="http://www.festivaltravel.co.uk" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.festivaltravel.co.uk">www.festivaltravel.co.uk</a></a>) and the logo is nailed (not here for a crit, certain many here could slaughter my feebleness!) rather I'm here for some much needed deadline slamming into me help&hellip; <BR> <BR>I'm using Drescher Grotesk throughout but the client has asked for cedillas and accents. I can see them in the Character Palette (I'm using Panther BTW) and I can double-click in there to get them to appear as unicode in Tidetext/textedit but of course not in illustrator (10) or InDesign (2). <BR> <BR>I cannot purchase the font/s as Opentype (I guess that would solve the issue?!) and here in London it's 3.15am and I've lost the will to live trying to fathom this out. <BR> <BR>Anyone able to solve this or say for certain it's impossible? Can't even find how to get the accent for a la carte ATM. <BR> <BR>Many thanks for any help offered!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Try creating a text file in your text editor, saving it, and then importing it into InDesign and Illustrator. This should work in any version of InDesign; you may need Illustrator CS, as this is the only version of Illustrator that supports Unicode. <BR> <BR>Note that you can also use the InDesign glyph palette, accessible from the Type menu. <BR> <BR>By the way, if you have Romanian text, the typographically correct form for the 'cedilla' is actually a kind of small, unattached comma-like mark under the S and T. This may be encoded  or T with <i>cedilla</i> because this is the codepoint used in the old Romanian 8-bit codepages. In Unicode, the Romanian diacritics were disunified from the cedilla forms, and given their own codepoints. You will, of course, be limited by what your font supports.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I could be wrong, John, but there might be a simpler solution to Marc's dilemma. <BR> <BR>Depending on which characters you need, you may be able to type them directly from the keyboard. The tricky part is knowing which keys or key combinations to type. <BR> <BR>Before Panther, you could just check the Key Caps utility. In Panther, Apple kind of hid hid it. <a href="http://www.maccritic.com/tips/article/294_0_12_0_M/" target="_blank">here is a page</a> that tells how to get it out of hiding. It's called the Keyboard Viewer now. Once you have it open on your screen, you can find the characters you want easily by trying different shift and option combinations. <BR> <BR>Alternatively, there are charts showing the standard key combinations, such as <a href="http://www.idiomware.com/accents.html" target="_blank">this one</a>. <BR> <BR>It may also be that the font you have does not have the exact accented characters you need. In that case, if you look in the Keyboard Viewer, you will see that there are also accents by themselves. These can be combined with any character using kerning to position them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know if you use InDesign, Mark, but John's suggestion to use the Glyph palette (under Type : Insert Glyphs) is the way to go. It shows all of the characters in a given font; double clicking on any character in the palette adds it at your insertion point.</div>
