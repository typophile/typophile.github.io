  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a shadower on these forums for quite a while, and I must admit I was a little afraid to put some of my stuff up. But I think I need it this time.</p>
<p>A colleague and I are starting a weekly podcast called <em>Witnessing Life</em> which is sort of a features/newsmagazine; sort of in the vein of &ldquo;All Things Considered&rdquo; on NPR. It is a twenty minute ordeal, with several small stories surrounding one big story. He is travelling to Europe for several months on a academic journalism grant, and along with a few strategically-placed correspondents, will be reporting back to me, and I&rsquo;ll put their audio clips together into a cohesive podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also designing an identity for the project; a site, business cards, letterhead, a press kit, and a logo.</p>
<p>What I have in mind is something that refers back to the old-time broadcasting days—think <em>Goodnight, and Good Luck</em>, except with the radio.</p>
<p>But I do want to have a modern, colorful scheme. My JPEG rendering may be a little off&hellip; I&rsquo;m thinking a powder blue, maybe a bit more intense.</p>
<p>I think my font is a little off, though, and would appreciate any advice you might have about the placement and incorporation of the microphone into the logo as a whole. After designing it, I retrospectively realized the &ldquo;Witnessing Life&rdquo; part looks somewhat like the <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> logo.</p>
<p>And I know, the name sounds a little religious. My colleague came up with that, and we&rsquo;ve gotta stick with it. But I have free reign with the design.</p>
<p>So, teachers, please give me your thoughts. I&rsquo;ll try not to run off crying. (-:</p>
<p>-Andy</p>

<p>This guy is awesome&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always liked that really 20s-esque Deco &ldquo;Atlas Shrugged&rdquo; cover. The Guy Noir stuff is pretty cool, too.</p>
<p>I will definitely look closely on his stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the way you have positioned the microphone on the splashscreen visual is always going to work better than that of the business card, if the microphone was centred and behind the logo and url (the illustration could be in front and slightly running into the logo, though probably not the url as it is more critical that it can be read accurately) and the contact details worked to either side of the stand. I would, if possible, drop or reword the strapline, the copy really doesn&rsquo;t fit in with the retro feel of the graphics or add anything in the way of a description, something cosier might be an improvement if you feel you must keep it, I would also use the Hosted by of the splashscreen on the business card rather than with.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what advice I would give about getting that &ldquo;retro&rdquo; look. When I do it, I rely on intuition. The stuff seems to come bubbling up out of subconscious memories of things I saw as a little kid in the late fifties. I just recently discovered a series of covers of detective novels done by an artist in the 1940s which looked very similar to my Guy Noir design. I don&rsquo;t remember ever seeing them before, but I may well have seen one or more of them in my grandparents' house as a kid. (My grandmother went through detective novels like pop corn.)</p>
<p>About the only thing I can think of to suggest is to get hold of some reference images. Don&rsquo;t look at &ldquo;retro&rdquo; designs made by modern designers&ndash;go to the source. Antique stores in small towns are gold mines. Old calendars, packages, post cards, magazines, books&ndash;anything with graphic images applied to it. There are also some good books with collections of old graphic imagery. The Taschen &ldquo;All American Ads&rdquo; series is great as is Louise Fili&rsquo;s Art Deco series of books (&ldquo;French Modern,&rdquo; &ldquo;Italian Art Deco,&rdquo; &ldquo;British Modern,&rdquo; etc.).</p>

<p>Thank you for your help. Tim, I&rsquo;ll make sure to stick with the &ldquo;Hosted by&hellip;&rdquo; logo rather than the one on the business card. Mark, once again—I have a copy of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> with your cover, and I think it is great. That sweeping 1920s deco really looks good. And unfortunately, the only subconscious memories I have as a kid is from the eighties. (-:</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve got a couple cool old book stores here in town; I bet I can find some good looking stuff there.</p>
<p>If you have some share-able fonts that might spruce up <em>Witnessing Life</em>, I would love to see them.</p>
<p>Thank you again!</p>
