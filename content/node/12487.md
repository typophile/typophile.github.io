  script font. Nearest I got was Englische Schreibschrift medium. Also tried putting
  just the 'L' through MyFonts.com but that only threw up Gwendolyn ROB. Any ideas...?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nPAUL

  body: Hi Paul. I think this is a handrawn capital L repositioned to sit in front
    of a slightly condensed and redrawn Shelley Script - either the Allegro or Andante.
    My guess is that the 'L' in all three variants of the Shelley weren't quite readable
    enough... also the connection between the 'o' and 'n' at the end has been jazzed
    up with a superfluous ball terminal.

  body: I also think its a custom L. Have you considered <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/kunstlerschreibsch/kunstlerschreibschrift-d-bold/testdrive.html?s=Lanson&p=72  target=new>Kunstler
    Script?</a>

  body: "I agree with the idea that something has been customized, but my guess at
    the font used is Englische Schreibschrift (Kuenstler was close). I think the tail
    on the L has been redrawn, because the only L I found that looked like that 'out
    of the box' was from York Script, but other letters were not very close. This
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/english-157/english-157/testdrive.html?s=Lanson&p=72\"
    target=\"new\">link shows English 157</a>, which is Bitstream's version of the
    script. I think the 's' and 'o' characters are closer than Kuenstler.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure if Test drives show connections well, because they are not kerned properly,
    but I suspect that the connectors were also drawn in for the Lanson logo.\r\n\r\n-
