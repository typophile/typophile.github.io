  right now, and wanted to ask some of you experts what was the right way to do things.
  \ It's a science thesis, so there's lots of quantities like approximately 20%.  The
  usual way to write this is ~20%.  My question is this: Should there be a space between
  the ~ and the number or not?\r\n\r\n~20\r\nor \r\n~ 20"

  body: I say no space should be the rule, generally. In cases where you can make
    it clear that all values in a specific area are approximations, I'd just make
    a separate note and drop all the ~s. This advice comes without consulting any
    style manuals, it's just personal opinion.

  body: "I agree about dropping the tilde if able. Its usage is pretty diverse and
    no one meaning is very dominant, at least among my peers in America.\r\n\r\nJust
    to be clear, the tilde is used in mathematics to indicate an equivalency, not
    an approximation. In english, Tilde are often used to express \"approximate to\"
    NOT \"approximately equal to\" . If you're using that in an equation with two
    values, it's my opinion that you should use \u2248 . If the approximation is a
    value itself, i'd use a thin space.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
