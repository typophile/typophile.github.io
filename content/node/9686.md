  body: HI Mike, <BR> <BR>the actual name of the symbol is Khanda, which might  help
    you in tracking it down. <BR> <BR>But i found this large .png which is good enough
    to vectorise if you wanna save yourself some work ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67080.png"
