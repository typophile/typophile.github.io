Just came across the ISTD awards call for entries in my emails again and thought I let you know -- the last ISTD Awards were held back in 2004, so it's really a rare opportunity taking part ;)

The International Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD) Awards 2009 are an opportunity for all practising designers to submit their work to be judged by today’s leading graphic design and typography specialists.

Categories range from book design, packaging, and signage to digital media and integrated campaigns as well as type design.

To enter, your work must have been published between 1st January 2007 and 31st January 2009. Typography should be an integral part of the design solution. There are three types of awards:

Certificate of Excellence
Awarded to all finalists – Work accepted as being eligible for a Certificate of Excellence shows a high standard of design in conjunction with a high standard of typography.

Premier Awards
Awarded to outstanding submissions in each category – Premier Awards are chosen from the work that has met the criteria for a Certificate of Excellence, but which is also outstanding in the view of the majority of the jurors.

Winner of the ISTD International Typographic Award 2009
Nominated from the overview of all Premier Awards, in all categories. – Awarded to the item judged to be a significant typographical achievement, which catches the imagination of all the jurors, and exemplifies outstanding typographic excellence.

The winning work will be featured on the ISTD website and in the ISTD 2009 Awards Publication.

The deadline for entries is 31 March 2009.
