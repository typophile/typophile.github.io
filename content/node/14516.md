body: "My goals for the design are modern, european, clean.  This is for a gallery
  space I will be opening next month but I can't seem to find exactly the right typeface,
  and I don't have the skills to create my own.\r\n\r\nIn the current design I like
  the forms of the \"e\" and \"o\" although the dots above the \"o\" were put in by
  me and I don't like the size or position yet.  I was hoping someone would know of
  a font that was very close to this but a more uniform ear on the \"r\" and a flat
  terminal on the \"t\".\r\n\r\nI hope I said all of that correctly without sounding
  like a complete neophyte.\r\n\r\nAny help would be GREATLY appreciated since I'm
  on a very rushed deadline now that I am able to move in a month early than I was
  previously able to."

  body: "Greetings. You are on the right track with the design you have so far. It
    appears very clean and modern...but I don't know if the typeface alone reads as
    \"European\". Do the dots above the \"o\" help in pronunciation, or are they simply
    there to create the feeling of a European name? Have you tried any fonts as common
    as \"Helvetica\" or \"Helvetica Neue\" bold? Both offer a \"t\" with a flat terminal.
    I was a little unclear on what you meant by a uniform ear on the \"r\". Best of
    luck on your next stage in the creative process.\r\n\r\n-Ben"

  body: "The umlaut softens the pronunciation so T\xF6tre should be read as Toetre,
    so if the pronunciation is different you might consider losing it. Helvetica is
    the nearest to your sample, you might also look at Futura for a more geometric
    look or [[Jeremy Tankard\u2019s]] <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm\">Aspect</a>
    as a modern example. I like the image (someone looking at a picture was my interpretation,
    but only after I read that this for a gallery). Also t\xF6t(re) could be roughly
    translated from German to English as kill(er) or tot(re) as dead(er) if that is
    something you need to consider.\r\nTim"

    not so sure about that. \"Tot\" means dead in German (adjective). A \"T\xF6ter\"
    is a kiler, but \"T\xF6tre\" doesn't have any meaning, and neither does \"totre.\"\r\n\r\nEven
    if the gallery's name were \"killer,\" I don't think that would automatically
    be bad. It might even be cool, in a pomo way\u2026 But in any event, not a real
    concern because the word ends in \"re\" instead of \"er.\""

  body: "Thanks for everyones comments.\r\n\r\nI've tried changes with the typefaces
    everyone had suggested, but there is something about \"Akkurat\" that I like so
    I think I'm going to use it. Although I tightened up the kerning a bit, and now
    it feels more like an identity to me.  Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.totre.com/totre-version-2.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
    umlaut is necessary for the pronuciation, plus it adds a bit of a european feel
    I want.  Kind of cheesy I know, but I'm building this brand from scratch and don't
    have a huge marketing budget to throw at it yet.\r\n\r\nOriginally when I search
    for totre I came up with a meaning in sanskrit \"whip in the right hand\" which
    I thought was mildly amusing.  However I really like the idea it being similar
    to \"killer\", not sure how I can use that to my advantage yet but it will be
    fun trying.\r\n\r\nAs far as the mark goes I'm still working on that.  Orginally
    it was supposed to be a commentary on ultra simplified modern art (ie one circle
    on a canvas) and at the same time creating a clean simple mark.    I'm going to
    work on it some more today and tomorrow and see what I can come up with.\r\n\r\n"

    nor if visually\r\nit has to be.\r\n\r\nAs for it being modern and for an art
    gallery, the trademark\r\nyou have created, while simple, fails to be memorable
    and/or unique.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that is because conceptually it isn't as refined.\r\n\r\nWhat
    does a pill have to do with a gallery?\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to be a smartass,
    however the point of having a logo\r\nmark is to have it surplant a written name.
    \ Nike is Nike without\r\nsaying its name, just the swoosh.  At the very least
    have this ability.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, I highly recommend concentrating on defining
    the\r\nvisual mark before going on to the type.\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nYou don't need
    a visual mark and should just focus on the type as\r\nthe mark."

  body: "I don't get the point of the pill. Before you introduced it, you were on
    your way to a nicely abstract logo. The pill makes it so much more figurative
    that a) you lose the European feel and b) you risk stirring associations you might
    not want.\r\n\r\nIf by European you mean highly simplified and sober, I'd go back
    to the first image. Using the pill makes me think much more of American  than
    European logo's.\r\n\r\nSomething else: have you tried scaling the image slight
    up? I think the subtly round edges should aline with the round tops of the o and
    e. Optically round forms need to extend slightly over the top and bottom of the
    x-height to create the illusion of eveness.\r\n\r\nIt is promising, though --
    keep at it!\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy

  body: One reason Nike swoosh works is because of the Millions of Dollars put into
    pushing it as their Corporate Idenity. Same goes for Rebok or any other major
    retailer worldwide. A mark for an art gallery might work but it will have to work
    over time. The gallery will never have the marketing or buying power to make it
    well known, but if it is adapted over time it could become a symbol for the gallery.
    The question is it memorable and appropriate. The pill might be constrewed for
    a drug company or pharmacy.

    but our major focus will be generating a diverse collection of prints we want
    to sell from a large variety of artists.  Try to make art & design that we like
    more widely available to those who can't really spend $4000 on a painting, and
    artists who can't afford to purchase 100 prints of their work up front.\r\n\r\nOur
    branding and marketing efforts will run along the same lines as:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.threadless.com\">Threadless</a>\r\n<a

    upload anything they want to sell.  This is run more like an art gallery, where
    different pieces are selected by us, and offered for sale on the site and in the
    physical gallery space.  However we will be able to create prints of different
    work we offer in house, making it cheaper for us and the artists we will represent.\r\n\r\nI
    guess I'm really not sure how to explain the brand I am trying to create.  If
    someone sees a pill and a name I guess their first impression will be a drug company.
    \ Just like if I created an image of an easel before the text you would think
    art gallery, maybe.  Although seeing the design in an advertisement, business
    card or in our gallery space (which is in a building with 20 other galleries)
    people would read more into the choice of using the pill.\r\n\r\nThe whole \"European\"
    thing was more about the typeface than the symbol.  So I guess that's really not
    that intregal part of the over all design.\r\n\r\nI think what I'm going to do
    is do a little market research with some fellow design students and get their
    impressions before going further with this to see how much confusion there is.\r\n\r\nThanks
