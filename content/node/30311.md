    site</a> shows it available via bank transfer and his stuff will be on MyFonts
    soon.

  body: "And aren't the prices very reasonable? With average prices south of a hundred
    dollars, I'm heading south of the board for my next font purchases!\r\n\r\nAlso
    check out Artifex and Integra- the Optimas of Mexico? I think so!\r\n\r\nScrumptious
    stuff there. Thank you for posting. I saw this too at the Porchez type blog and
    I'm glad to know its available now.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :o)"
