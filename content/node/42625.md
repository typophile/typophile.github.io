  a non-paying gig and the clients are my boyfriend and our close friend, I'm continuing
  to tweak it ad infinitum....\r\n\r\nWith the help of some typophiles, I've revisited
  the kerning.  How does this look to y'all?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_cmyk_looser_flat_5346.png]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    also try pulling the arm of the r over towards the e if you did that. That might
    make the air around each letter more equivalent.\r\n\r\nWhy the new thread?"

    really belong in this forum.    And I'm anal retentive, OK?   :)\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of anal retentive, the r & e could only take the slightest nudge apart, IMO -
    any more felt like too much:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_cmyk_looser_flat_2_4336.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
    possible that the puddles need to be nudged - they can easily make the kerning
    seem all out of whack."

  body: This font was designed to be set tighter I think - so when you open it up
    for logo use if you want to make it splendid instead of very good you have to
    change the shapes of the letters. I think it is quite good now. I might add a
    hair more space between the s & c to get that last little bit of what's possible
    before you edit outlines. BTW I think the wider spacing works better & is needed
    because the bright colors and the relative darkness of them interferes with reading
    the letter shapes a little. The extra space leps you find the forms. What if the
    puddle were slightly less high? Or higher? How does that feel? What if the puddles
    were just a bit lower?

  body: "Here's some further adjustment, this time shown small as well - I think it's
    pretty obvious that I'm going to need a version for small sizes, with its own
    spacing.  Eben, the logo will mostly be seen at small sizes, with the glaring
    exception of the large banner.  While the latter may well benefit from changing
    the letterforms, I think the former won't.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_cmyk_looser_flat_3_6229.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_cmyk_looser_flat_3b_6632.png]"

    easy and it isn't as if you are going off the rails here - it's really just a
    question of how far you feel like taking it. Theoretically you could make adjustments
    for any optical size that was different than the one the font was designed to
    be used in. Unless you want to second guess the designer, in which case you can
    have at the intended sizes too. I tend to want to do all that. Then there is the
    question of specific letter relationships and the question of being eye catching.
    Either of those could also drive you to adjust letters - especially in a logo.
    In your logo though the color is the eye catcher. For me this is what's left:
    the r keeps grabbing my attention because it feels too dark/heavy to me. But that
    may just be me. I would probably try a bit more space between the s&c again as
    well."

    a place for special logo oriented letter shape alteration. Either the left outer
    serif on the m, or the tail of the a or a bit of both.\r\n\r\nYou could also just
    open everything up to match the a/m relationship. If it was going to be used very
    small I might go that route. For use at larger sizes I would pull the m in tighter."

    from touching the logo any more, but if I sneak in some tweaks, it will be to
    extend the a tail a little, and perhaps loosen up the front of the word to match
    the end.  \r\n\r\nFor now, though - I need to finish the flavors, sizes, and biz
