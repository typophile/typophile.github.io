body: "This is not so much a question, but an acknowledgement of an interesting project
  I have my students working on. They are to travel around St. Louis (Missouri, USA)
  and photograph interesting uses of outdoor typography. They are then to identify
  the typefaces used, if possible, and the results are posted on this website.\r\nAlthough
  we've only just started, it's been really interesting, and exciting as well. My
  students are much more atuned to the type they see around them everyday, and are
  learning a great deal about type identification. \r\nI thought it might be a subject
  this board would like to hear about.\r\n\r\nhttp://users.stlcc.edu/cgroth/signs/"

  body: What a great project! I wish I had a cool type class like that my sophomore
    year. Actually, I wish I had a type class like that now, instead of the crappy
    one I'm in now.

  body: Great idea! This is a good hands on way for a student to begin to understand
    type. Chuck, if I ever get into teaching on the University level, may I use this
    idea?

    body: You certainly may, Terry. It's gotten the students looking around themselves
      all the time now, trying to outdo each other!

    type isn't Goudy, though. Looks like it might be Baskerville."

    body: "Marox-\r\nIt is Goudy. Perhaps it's hard to see the serifs clearly in the
      photo. Would it be better if I made the images larger? Would the site work better?"

  body: Actually, I got the idea from a similar thing that was done at Loyola a few
    years ago. Different images of found typography were displayed. My refinement
    comes in the identification of the typefaces, which is something the Loyola folks
    didn't attempt.

  body: "With all due respect, Chuck, I don't think it's Goudy. In the comparison
    I've uploaded, take a look at the top left of the N, the outward-flaring serifs
    of the T, and the higher waistline of the A in the Goudy.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marcoxborrow.com/intag.gif"

  body: The serifs on the storefront type are much more organic than Baskerville's,
    and if you take another look, I think you'll see what I mean. Although I will
    say that your cut of Baskerville is very different than mine. It's interesting,
    isn't it? I'm not currently at my screen with my whole font library, but I'll
    take a closer look on Monday.
