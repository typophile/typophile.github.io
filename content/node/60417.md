body: "Hey!\r\n\r\nSo I just started using Indesign to create a new report. I am looking
  to create something similar to this Red Cross report. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.climatecentre.org/downloads/File/reports/RCRC_climateguide.pdf\r\n\r\nRight
  now I am trying to find out that font and size I should use for a good printed publication.
  I am guessing quite a few people will read it online as well and so if the fonts
  works for that as well that would be good. What sizes should I use on heading etc?
  Are there any good websites to have a look at for good examples - preferably easy
  to understand :)\r\n\r\nThank you for you help!\r\n\r\nWarmest regards,\r\nJonas"
