body: I did a job last year, making new text-templates for a Norwegian publisher.
  I ended up using Minion and FF Kievit. It worked out just perfect, but now, one
  year later we&#39;re revising the templates cause we&#39;re having problems with
  Kievit. <BR> <BR>I had FF cut a special version with normal figures in Kievit Regular,
  and OSF in Kievit Caps. Mainly for practical usage. But ever since we started using
  the new templates, we&#39;ve had postscript errors because of the typeface from
  here to eternity. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"
  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Now I have to find a substitute. Any suggestions. What I&#39;m
  looking for is a legible OpenType font &#40;Kievit is not OT&#41;, with true Caps
  and Italic. It has to be friends with Minion, and have atleast weights in regular,
  medium and bold. <BR> <BR>Rune D

  body: Thanks for all the replies. <BR> <BR>I had a look at Avenir Next, and most
    likely I&#39;ll recomend it for my client, even though I find it a little to geometrical
    for my taste. Personally I have no problems with Kievit. It&#39;s a great font,
    and I think Mike Abbink has done a wonderful job. I have never experienced the
    postscript errors myself &#40;even though it might have seemed that way&#41;,
    but it seems to be a common problem among the others working for this publisher.
    This publisher produces in between 60 - 100 books a year. <BR> <BR>As I mentioned
    I haven&#39;t experienced these problems myself. I work in InDesign 2/3, but I
    know that several others use Fram Maker for practical reasons. I&#39;ve had plenty
    of discussions on why they still use FM. I would also like to mention that in
    saying &#39;the others&#39;, I&#39;m talking about people who don&#39;t have any
    typographic education ... they just make books. What&#39;s a correct English term
    for this? They might be clever at using the programs, fast and cheap, but sadly
    no passion. But I guess that&#39;s a common problem. &#40;Do I sound irritated?&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Anyway ... I will also have a talk with FF in Germany to see if they
    know what&#39;s wrong, because the best would be to keep using Kievit.

  body: i am a bit irritated about the FM bashing. of course it depends on the type
    of the books, but for more technical topics without the need for an extraordinairy
    design FM is IMHO the more appropriate tool to go than indesign. <BR> <BR>But
    maybe version 3 has improved features for the handling of long texts, table of
    contents, indices, footnotes, diagram/equation numeration and things like that
    needed in book production -- i only tried out version 2 and missed some features

  body: I&#39;ve only been using ID 3 for a couple of months, but it seems as though
    some of the more practical funktions that FM has, still are missing. I.e. generating
    several indexes in one document ... but I&#39;m note sure of this. Another thing
    is that I don&#39;t know if ID3 has eased working with footnotes and sideheads.
    I suspect that FM is still a bit more practical for longer documents. I&#39;m
    starting a 500 page book in ID next week, with sideheads. So I&#39;ll be back
    then to post reports. <BR> <BR>But ... I&#39;ve heard that Adobe will not be producing
    FM for Mac anymore, so I hope they will improve InDesigns practical functions
    &#40;if needed, it might be me not finding these functions&#41;.

  body: I should add that the problem with FrameMaker, at least from a Typophile perspective,
    is that its typography is quite primitive by comparison to InDesign. More at the
    QuarkXPress level, I&#39;d say. <BR> <BR>But it does have pretty awesome long
    document features. <BR> <BR>T

    Interesting to see if I can get the sideheads to work out, but I can imagine that
    a practical function for sideheads would be alot like the footnotes. And since
    ID still doesn&#39;t support footnotes ...

  body: Yes, thereis some research suporting the use of serif type over sans serif
    for long texts but this is not a clear choice based on data of an entire set of
    typographic specs and there isn&#39;t that much difference in readability anyway.  You
    find variances in the data based on where the testing was done and the backgrounds
    of the the people sampled.  There are even cultural differences hinting at the
    possibility that you can read better that which you are more used to reading &#40;people
    from countries where sans serif is prevalent read it better than people from countries
    where it is not&#41;. <BR>I personally prefer sans serif for text so long as it
    is in a good typeface and set with good typography.  I find Bodoni to be an incredible
    beautiful typeface which I use often when it can be set large enough but find
    it too difficult to read at smaller &#34;book sizes&#34;. <BR>Once upon a time,
    books were set in blackletter &#40;which is very hard to read for people today&#41;.  There
    probably was some outcry when people first started using Roman type to set books.
    <BR> <BR>Why do we need such absolute rules today when anything is possible?  There
    always fas been good and bad in the design of everything.  Time has a way of sorting
    it out but not always in the way we might predict.  The paintings of the French
    Academy were the rage of their day and those of the Fauves were looked upon with
    disdain.  Today the tables are turned.  Let typgraphers use whatever types they
    deem best, serif, sans or mix.  When done well, I welcome them all. <BR> <BR>The
    world is a big place and technology has made it possible for us to do things quickly
    which were never possible before.  We don&#39;t need to stymie typographers with
    iron-clad rules from previous generations.  We should have open minds and let
    the talents of typgraphers now and in the future come to bear.  Some will succeed
    and some will fail but none will succeed if we don&#39;t let them try. <BR> <BR>Chris
