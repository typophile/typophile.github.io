  body: "Thermographic inks are heat sensitive so they get heated and they puff up.
    It is often used as an inexpensive option to egraving. When the ink puffs it acts
    kind of like dot gain and letter edges grow and counters can fill in.\r\n\r\nHolographic
    foils need a opaque white under colors. Check the sheet sizes as the foil sheet
    may not match the size of the base paper or board they are being laminated to."
