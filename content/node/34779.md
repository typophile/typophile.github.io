  colors, and I have it generate the  instructions, it lists four process inks too,
  even though, to the best of my knowledge, I haven't used any. How can I prevent
  this from happening? \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "You can delete the colors you don't use from your swatches palette, manually,
    or by pressing the little arrow and choose 'select all unused' and delete.\r\n\r\nChances
    are that it still lists CMYK colors if you for example generate a PDF of it, but
    since you do not use those colors, that should not matter. You can always instruct
    your printer to ignore those plates, if they do not already, since there is nothing
    on them.\r\n\r\nAlso, the color 'Registration' (for crop marks and such) is built
    up from CMYK (or maybe the colors that are present in your document, I'm not sure)."

  body: Good call on deleting from the swatches palette--you can't delete black, (for
    which reason I hadn't tried the others), but they can apparently be axed. Thanks!

  body: The registration marks basically defined in RGB thus present on all plates,
    but the registration swatch is a little bit special as it is also is on all spot
    colour plates.

    at with my  <em>'or maybe the colors that are present in your document, I\u2019m
