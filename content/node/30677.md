  body: "A quick search of 'stencil' fonts at MyFonts didn't find anything that seemed
    to match the sample. It's quite possible that this is a faux stencil, and if this
    is what you need to duplicate, it should be easy to pick a sans that would be
    hard to tell apart from this, since none of these letters, except maybe the C,
    is very distinctive.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
