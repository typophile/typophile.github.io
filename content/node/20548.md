  typeface that would work well with Garage Fonts Metroflex typeface system. I'm not
  completely tied to using a slab-serif with the only requirements being those previously
  mentioned and the face works well at large sizes.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens_2.html?sku=GF061013X1P2&start=1"

  body: Nearly any clean, modern, slab will work well with Metroflex. More importantly,
    tell us more about the project and your audience.

  body: The project is a hybrid catalog/magazine for a large vacation tour operation
    company. The book will need to work both for travel agents and consumers. The
    demographics reflect prodominately female clients with the age group ranging from
    30-60. I see this magalog falling somewhere in line, as far as look and feel,
    with Conde Naste Traveler. I won't go into the details of occupations and average
    household incomes etc.
