		<div class="commentbody">Tom &ndash; Better use of white and black. I can see rays of light now. But, how does it work at smaller sizes? And, how will you incorporate color?

		<div class="commentbody">Good questions Tiffany. Below are the logos at smaller sizes. They won't need to be any smaller than what I have them at. I don't want to take too many rays out because I like the gradual increase in the shapes of the tail of the &quot;k&quot;. Let me know if you think it looses too much, but I don't feel it does. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as color I will tackle that next.

		<div class="commentbody">Tom, I like the image you're going for quite a bit, but I think the K needs to be sturdier. The righthand leg feels too flared, or perhaps too tapered at the top. The thinning of the upper diagonal is better in the second version, but I still think the flaring of the leg is too strong. Also, the lefthand leg is getting eaten away by the negative space of the rays, but I'm not sure that's as much of a problem. Adjusting these might help for smaller sizes, though (which will cause problems at all of those joins). I guess I'd recommend being freer with the manipulation of the original letterform. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are you still considering Champion Gothic Bantamweight? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, I prefer the earlier versions, in spite of the piano interpretations.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Tom, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess you want the rays effect to expand the &quot;lighting/radiant&quot; concept? I like it but I think the logo looks a bit &quot;oldie&quot; as an 80's corporate logo (can't think on a more correct word, sorry). I know there will be type and more info on it and this can change how I'm looking to it now. I've looked on an old logo book (from '91 DAVID E.

		<div class="commentbody">I'll have to admit over-using the linear halftoning effect during the late 80s and early 90s myself, and for that reason I haven't found myself going there anymore, but I wouldn't steer Tom away from experimenting with the technique. I think exploring as many techniques as possible for value gradation is essential to any designer's education. This is a great collection of samples Adriano. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not quite feelin' the logo yet, Tom. Fortunately for you, I don't have to. I think I'm on a similar page to Ryan's. I'm not crazy about the flaring of the leg and upper arm/stroke (optical). I kind of like the light rays starting inside the base of the stem, but I wonder if they angled, causing a slight flare to the base of the stem, if it would offer more stability. Maybe even start the top ray by completely separating the base of the stem by following the upper arm/stroke through the stem. Have you tried stopping the rays at the outer edge of the leg? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just some thoughts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aloha! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you should bolster the lower-left leg (spine), perhaps having the vertex of the rays farther to the right. Obviously, the optical perception of the vertex will vary with print size and technique, but right now that part looks too thin IMO. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about alternating an extra-long (beyond the square shape) ray and a shorter one to add some visual interest to that side? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, about the &quot;80s look&quot;: Most of the companies that used a linear halftone logo were telecommunications (AT&amp;T) or high-tech, like the ones Adriano posted.

The first level is visual description: rays. The second one is a subtle presentation of light by thin white spaces (between rays) which actually &quot;shine&quot; somewhere from behind the K logo. The thick parts, which are sitting on the rays then make little geometrical shadows. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That first logos make the viewer FEEL the light. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am afraid this second layer of meaning has been spoiled in later versions.
