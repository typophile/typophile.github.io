  is no more.</a> <BR> <BR>I feel kinda sad. It was the first dtp programme I learnt.
  My Korean lecturer called it Pageymaker. <BR> <BR>But I do wish that I got a pair
  of these <a href="http://www.makingpages.org/pagemaker/history/" target="_blank">
  boxers</a> &#40;scroll down&#41; to earn myself a true geek status. Oooh what a

  body: I remember laying out the faculty magazine on my LC575 with a team of friends
    squashed in my hostel room.  <BR> <BR>And after that a slew of magazines, annual
    reports, menus, posters, programmes, etc when I worked in an in-house design department.
    <BR> <BR>Lots of Pagemaker memories. There&#39;s always that dreaded &#34;Document
    was not saved properly...&#34; dialogue box and do you want the last saved or
    the most recent version? <BR> <BR>And the most recent version never works! <BR>
    <BR>I never got to try out all the plug ins though. Only the drop cap one. Hmm.

    a service bureau. I went to Quark, a typographic nightmare and now I have InDesign
    CS, big smiles here.

  body: 'I was a PageMaker user from the earliest Mac version. I tried using version
    1.0 to do pages for the <i>Utne Reader</i>. I was obviously crazy. Version 1.x
    actually stored documents as Mac resource files, a really inadvisable idea, as
    it turned out. It lead to very fragile document files. I was constantly losing
    work. Aldus wisely abandoned that approach in 2.0. &#40;Also, it wouldn&#39;t
    have worked on Windows if they hadn&#39;t.&#41; <BR> <BR>Some things I remember
    about PageMaker 1.0: <BR>- No kerning or tracking <BR>- No auto-hyphenation <BR>-
    You couldn&#39;t resize text blocks except by changing the column guidelines and
    reflowing them <BR>- You couldn&#39;t work in spreads &#40;you could preview them,
    though&#41; <BR>- 16 pages maximum <BR>- No spell-checking <BR>- Auto-leading
    only <BR>- No font menu &#40;only a dialog box&#41; <BR>- No left and right justified
    text <BR>- No style sheets <BR>- You had to insert your &#34;key disk&#34; in
    order to run it <BR>- It was about ten times better than MacPublisher or ReadySetGo!
    <BR> <BR>I got Quark 1.0 as soon as it was released. On paper it ran circles around
    PageMaker. It seemed like a dream come true: kerning, auto-hyphenation, run-arounds.
    In fact, it was a buggy nightmare. My analogy at the time was that PageMaker was
    a dull but reliable sedan, and Quark was a temperamental sports car that was in
    the shop most of the time.  <BR> <BR>I ended up switching back to PageMaker for
    most stuff until Quark 3.0, which finally lived up to its promises and overtook
    PageMaker as the professional choice.'

  body: It was released in July 1985. At that time, it was the first program that
    would not run on the original 128k Mac. You needed the 512k model and two disk
    drives because the program took up 275k--most of a 400k floppy--leaving little
    room for system files and fonts. You needed the other drive for your document
    files.  <BR> <BR>Hard drives were not really an option on those early Mac models.
    &#40;There were a few in the 5-10MB range starting at about $2000.&#41; Things
    got better by 1986 when 800k floppies and more affordable hard drives started
    becoming available.  <BR> <BR>Looking back, all that stuff was incredibly expensive
    compared to today, especially when you take inflation into account. I think I
    spent $1400 on 2MB of RAM in about 1987. That would be like paying about $2400
    for 1GB, about the relative equivalent amount of RAM nowadays.

    <BR> <BR>Mark, I had almost completely obliterated the last remaining evidence
    of ReadySetGo! from my brain. Thanks a lot. The really weird thing? ReadySetGo!
    is still developed and supported. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.diwan.com/ready/prsg.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.diwan.com/ready/prsg.htm</a> <BR> <BR>And speaking
    of Quark, my first experience with a Quark application was using WordJuggler on
    my then girlfriend&#39;s Apple IIe, in all its 80-column, green phosphor glory.
    If you think a CompuGraphic 7200 had arcane keyboard commands for text formatting,
    then you never used WordJuggler.

  body: Oh, this is funny. I&#39;m looking at an issue of MacWorld from 1984 and there&#39;s
    a product listing for a 10MB hard disk for $1995 that works with Apple II&#39;s
    and Macs. The manufacturer? Quark. Yes, <i>that</i> Quark.

    processor for the Apple II which lead eventually to XPress &#40;as we used to
    call it&#41;.

    <BR>The original XPress documentation looked very much like that, except it was
    navy blue. I still have it, although the box got slighy water damaged a few years
    ago. <BR> <BR>Notice how their old logo uses the same font as the old Apple logo
