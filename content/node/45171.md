body: I'm a newbie with an academic interest in early 17th century typesetting practices,
  particularly how certain typesetting errors could occur and how they would be detected/corrected.  I
  would be grateful for some input on books to consult or Internet sources.

  body: "Not sure about sources, but some errors I have heard of are letters upside
    down, like the 'e', and space characters that rode too high on the stick, and
    resulted in a black box printing instead of a space. (And of course the wrong
    letter chosen from the case.)\r\n\r\nOthers here probably know more."

  body: "I bet that I am not the only letterpress printer who is mouthing, whilst
    glaring at the\r\nscreen in utter disbelief \u2014 'what the heck is that advice'
    about printing from a stick... and black boxes...?\r\n\r\nThis is technical, in
    the sense that a practitioner could really explain it to you whereas\r\nsomeone
    who knows nothing about it at all could not! One composes in a stick; I have yet
    to hear of anyone printing from it! \r\n\r\nUpside down letters \u2014 tis' obvious...
    the classic is the 's', followed by 'u' abd 'n'...\r\nand of course the expression
    'mind your p's and q's' may well derive from the ease with\r\nwhich lackadaisical
    comps muddled the typecase next-door neighbours... we are talking about letters
    that are cast backwards... I could go on all day but I don't think it would be
    necessary (try separating a figure 1 from a lower case l and from the upper case
    I... when they have been wrongly put back in the type case!)\r\nThen there are
    small cap figures too....\r\nThe rising spaces occurred because the line was set
    too strong or too loose or if the forme was badly locked up... these spaces would
    be boxes if they were square em quad indents opening paragraphs or indeed the
    em spaces that used to follow full points in prose texts...\r\n\r\nVoil\xE0 some
    light on the subject after the tarpaulin... "

  body: "and sorry, didn't complete last sentence.. the rising spaces were inevitably
    interword spaces which are more likely to be 3-pt wide by 8, 10, 11, 12-pt high
    ie rather fine narrow upright rectangle. I'm schematizing here...\r\nSpaces wear
    up and rise up during printing (rarely in my print shop)...."

    the printer, as the misquotations, mistaking of syllables, misplacing half lines,
    coining of strange and never heard of words, these being without number, when
    I would have taken a particular account of the Errata, the printer answered me,
    hee \r\nwould not publish his owne disworkmanship, but rather let his owne fault
    lye upon the necke of the author.\"\r\n\r\nYou have to love the term \"disworkmanship.\""
