  typefaces, like Zurich and (especially) Swiss 721, were actually \u201Cdesigned,\u201D
  or at least released?\r\n\r\nI seem to recall using them in HP LaserJet II printers
  with plug-in cartridges circa 1989. But I might be confusing that with Charter.\r\n\r\n(For
  reference, I\u2019m trying to fact-check my own arse in <a href=\"http://spacing.ca/wire/?p=2424#comment-107388\">this
  blog thread</a> about my recent Toronto subway type tour.)"

  body: "The \"Design Credits\" on myfonts.com (which is actually affiliated with
    Bitstream) says 1982. I've seen inaccuracies in those credits before, but in this
    case it sounds about right.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to really nail it, you could
    dig into the Seybold reports. According to <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/articles/new_faces_chapter_one:_technological_and_industrial_change:_setting_the_scene_/\">this
    thesis</a>, Bitstream opened its doors around 1981. It's not surprising that a
    Helvetica clone would be one of its first products."

    the time.
