  where was best.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to update our company logo. This is how it
  looks at present.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMA BlueSymbol Small_5052.jpg]\r\nThere
  are two problems with it. One is the lettering and the other is the composition.\r\n\r\nThe
  custom lettering falls apart at large sizes and doesn\u2019t look modern, especially
  with that underlining. The lines of the globe seem to interfere with the shapes
  of the letters. I am wondering if simply updating the font would be successful.
  I have been looking at possible alternatives and found [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=presence+bold+italic|Present
  Bold Italic]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cepuertas/urbana/UniqueName-7256-1188935622-1-73207/|Urbana
  Bold Italic]] very pleasant. I need advice which other fonts to look at. We want
  to convey cutting-edge, modern, personable, friendly, professional and perhaps not
  too corporate (more informal). We are a training company working with NGOs in International
  Development around the world. I think the font should be fairly heavy so it sets
  itself apart from the globe, perhaps. We use Helvetica Neue for our communications.\r\n\r\nColleagues
  here feel we should keep the globe (perhaps somehow being updated), and the overall
  look should be welcoming and clean. But, the other problem is that this logo is
  hard to use in monochrome or on a coloured background, because it is quite complicated.
  Ideally, I\u2019d like to change it completely but am short of concept on this one.
  So if anyone has suggestions how to simplify it, I\u2019d be grateful to hear/see
  them.\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The first thing I saw when looking at the logo is to use a face like Auto
    ( http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/underware/auto_1_bold_italic/?sample_text=ima
    )or something similar and modify it, i.e. drop the dot add serifs to the i etc...
    I would have change the angle of the globe make it the same color as the text
    and have the ima on a white rectangle cut through the globe maybe out line the
    top and bottom of the rectangle in the same weight and color as the globe. or
    something like that :)
