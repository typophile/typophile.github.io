    fonts, not sure which exactly, with some modifications (mainly the "n" and "d").

  body: Actually, the restaurants themselves. (I always notice the type in restaurants.)
    They use it a fair amount, not just for the logo. Lots of Neutraface there, too,
    and a similar sans I haven't quite identified yet.
