  The opening credits with the stencily font with the extra wide \u201CE\u201D was
  bad enough, and the \u201Clet\u2019s try to be authentic\u201D location names (Renner
  Architype for Austria and a cowboy font for Haiti!?) were only slightly less annoying,
  but the \u201CGreene Planet\u201D logo was pure 90\u2019s rave flyer. Bring back
  Q and the gadgets - leave the type to someone else."

  body: I love Bond just as much as I love type, but sadly the one rarely seems to
    care about the other. Earlier movies had some interesting stuff (a purely typographic
    opener for Dr. No and the half-nude bodies onto which images were projected in
    From Russia with Love and Goldfinger), but the type within the movies often seems
    more fitting for a TV show -- cliches and all. But I'm still eager to see QoS,
    cringe-worthy type be damned.

    guys did the titles http://www.mk12.com/ \r\n\r\nLow quality version here... http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=wHO3gYGY-bc
    the type is very blurry.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

  body: "Yes the movie title logo and the green company logo and the location identification
    type all annoyed. They even used Renner to identify Austria. How's that work now?
    The movie was fun if you can just ignore the type.\r\n\r\nI liked the titles though.
    Although the song has not grown on me yet. Nothing will match Mucca's \"Live and
    let die\"."

  body: Thanks for the Tomato link - although the Haiti visual doesn't match my recollection
    from the film. Maybe it changed or changed for the US. Grunge went out a few years
    ago over here. ;-)

    that the movie was BAD, but when the fonts are the more exciting part about it...)"
