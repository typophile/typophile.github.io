  Museum of Art & Design</a>. I\u2019m taking a graphic design course, and the task
  for the exam is to make some (hypothetical) material for this museum. To create
  a stronger bond with the museum\u2019s own site, I wanted to use their own font
  where possible (despite the fact that they seem to use Helvetica more), but I can\u2019t
  figure out what font it is, and whatthefont.com seems stumped, too.\r\n\r\nI hope
  someone here can help with a positive ID\u2014otherwise, I\u2019ll have to see if
  I can get in touch with someone at the museum directly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_kunstindustrimuseet_4F_4446.png]"

    logo.

  body: It's clearly a logotype and I doubt that they have a font made out of it.
    If you need to know, why don't you contact them directly? I agree some of the
    letters are way out of proportion and the overall "picture" looks unbalanced indeed.
    To me the "R" is also bolder than the rest.

  body: "I will try contacting them directly; I was hoping it was a recognisable font,
    but if it\u2019s a custom job or (worse) and Illustrator job, then I guess I\u2019m
    pretty much out of luck.\r\n\r\nAnd for some reason, I rather like it for this
    exact purpose, except for the R, which I find dreadful as well. The museum focuses
    on industrial design (furniture, porcelains, etc.), and it fits rather well with
    the overall style of the museum."

    The logo is made by Bo Linnemann of <a href=\"http://www.kontrapunkt.dk/\">Kontrapunkt</a>
    (who has made many far superior faces\u2014I wonder why this one is so sub-par),
    and there is no font made from it, only the letters needed for the logo were made."
