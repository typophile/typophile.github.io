    thanked the commenters but never showed us what you did with the logo. Might be
    nice to see how that logo is coming along before asking help with another school
    project. Thanks.

  body: "No problem. Not that you necessarily need to follow our advice, but it's
    nice to see how a logo progresses.\r\n\r\nI'm not much of a drinker so I'm probably
    not the best person to offer advice on the wine labels. The one on the left is
    more interesting, but I can't say that either one would make me stop and look.
    \r\n\r\nI've toured distilleries and I know the barrels are a big deal, so with
    a name like \"Big Barrel Winery\" my first impulse might be to do something with
    woodgrain or a simulated barrel (although maybe that's too obvious)."

  body: "Yeah I understand what you're saying but it seems as though a lot of the
    other students do that...\"Big Barrel Winery\", so they incorporate a \"Barrel\"
    in the design somehow. I try not to do the most obvious idea but then again it
    can sometimes be the best idea hey? It may help if I explain why I designed it
    this way...? Understand if it's too much reading...personally I hate reading ;-)\r\n\r\nFirstly
    djama Moscato will be produced in Maleny, Sunshine Coast Hinterland, QLD at the
    Big Barrel Winery. The traditional owners of this land is the aboriginal Kabi
    Kabi mob which is why the brand name of the wine has been given \u2018djama\u2019
    which means \u2018drink\u2019. It is also why the label has adopted the colours
    of the aboriginal flag (black, red and yellow) and the graphic is made up of aboriginal
    symbols (sun, rain, mountain and running water).\r\n\r\nWhilst googling images
    of wine bottle labels I found that I was most drawn to labels that allowed the
    viewer to see the colour of the bottle/wine via a cut out or a split \u2013 it\u2019s
    captivating. I believe that if two bottles of the exact same wine were side by
    side the viewer would choose the one with the most creative or eye-catching label.
    I also realised that the important/must have information is found on the back
    of the bottle leaving the front/main label clutter free/minimalistic. \r\n\r\nAs
    wine has been around for thousands of years I chose to have \u2018Big Barrel Winery\u2019
    and \u2018Moscato 2010\u2019 in a serif font (Book Antique) as it too has been
    around for a similar timeframe. You will notice that the winery, the wine type
    and the information on the back is in capitals, this is showing the consumer that
    this information is locked in and won\u2019t change. The brand name, however,
    is in lower case and a display type as it can change from wine to wine.  Blackadder
    ITC was used for the word \u2018djama\u2019 to differentiate it from the rest
    of the type.\r\n\r\nThe three elements that draw the consumer in most is the colour
    combination, the use of aboriginal symbols and the Glasshouse Mountains silhouette
    cut-out which reveals the wine/bottle colour. It is most intriguing. \r\n"

  body: "You're probably right about the barrel idea, it's a bit obvious. \r\n\r\nSounds
    like there are factors involved in your design that someone like me who lives
    in the U.S. would be unaware of (aboriginal symbols, Glasshouse mountain silhouette,
    etc). Folks in different parts of the world sometimes view designs very differently
    due to cultural and other differences.  Good luck with your project."

  body: The 2 second impression is that if I were in the store, I would not even pause
    to look at this wine. If I were to rationalize, it'd be due to the use of red
    on the label, or rather its particular shade, which is desaturated and pink-ish.
    It just doesn't associate with a glass of wine *at all*. It does however associate
    well with "Sale" stickers that they frequently use to label discounted products.
