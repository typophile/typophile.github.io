  is used in the new video game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.\r\n\r\nAt first glance,
  it looked to me like a fairly common font but i could not find one that fit it exactly.\r\n\r\nI
  was hoping this community could shed some light. \r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/2011-11-15_00001_5469.jpg]"
