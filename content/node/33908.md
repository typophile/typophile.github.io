  Perla which I love, but I''ve searched for something more "feminine" and kind of
  "swashy", yet I don''t want it to be too frilly. I must have looked at hundreds
  and hundreds of fonts before I fell for Perla, but maybe there''s something I''ve
  missed...? '

    body: "Hey, Steven, I use the unicase. Perla in caps looks like Modern no 20 and
      other fonts I tried out earlier. I love that \"little extra \" with Perla but
      maybe there's something even nicer that I haven't seen?\r\nI am a major control
      freak - I just need to be happy with Perla and go on with my (life) website.
      \ :-)  It's hard to find a font that's both feminine and simple though."

      then again, \"masculine and simple\" is probably as much of an oxymoron to us.
      \ ;-)  \r\nLet me rephrase it - a font that has a \"swash\" to it but isn't
      too ornate. Is that comprehensible enough for the masculine species?   ;-)"

    characters):\r\nhttp://www.insignedesign.com/Typeface.aspx?FamilyName=Questal\r\nWhile
    at the Insigne site, check out Valfieris, too.\r\n\r\nPeotica also has some nice
    features, feminine without being delicate (although a bit \"old-fashioned\" looking
    for my taste):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/poetica/familytree.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: Thank you for the suggestions. I liked Questal bold best - it kind of reminds
      me of Democratica. Still, Perla is nicer than anything I've seen so far. I agree
      with you on Poetica - not really my style either. :-)

    I only ask because we sell photopolymer plates to several hobby/craft jewelry
