    no, you don't need an expensive design package to take advantage of OpenType features.
    Apple's iWork supports OpenType, and it's only $79.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I have no idea
    where I got the idea that iWork supports OpenType. But my point remains the same.
    It is Microsoft's responsibility to make Word support OpenType, not vice-versa."

  body: "Microsoft was and is a major partner in opentype development and has been
    at the forefront of creating opentype standards. Microsoft, for business reasons,
    has avoided full support for opentype features in its applications. Perhaps the
    assumption is that anyone interested in true typographic sophistication, would
    not be using a word processor for publishing. It may even be assumed the the greatest
    percentage of Office users don't even know what the finer points of opentype typography
    are or even care to know, for that matter. The bottom line is, would they sell
    any significant amount more copies of MS Office after full opentype support than
    they do now without it? If there is no perception of increased profit, then there
    is no need to pursue development time and costs to that end. MS Office is almost
    the only show in town now. Why would Microsoft spend more on development than
    they can recoup in profit? Johns question even proves the point that the few customers
    who want opentype sophistication in typography for Office already own Office and
    don't even blame Microsoft for being lax in support of OT features.\r\nAdobe has
    the other share of the market--those professional publishers and designers who
    need typographic sophistication to do their work. A better question is to ask
    Adobe why their support for OT is inconsistent among their applications (at least
    the interface) and why one-for-many substitutions are yet to be supported? This
    is another case of internal struggle. You can be sure Thomas and Miguel would
    love to see it but they are in the Type group, not the CS Development group so
    they have no say in the matter (I'll bet they have tried like crazy though to
    have a say!)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nI apologize; I didn't mean to imply that I think Microsoft
    has an obligation to include OpenType support in MS Office. I do realize that
    Microsoft played a huge role in the development of OpenType. I was more suggesting
    that John's beef with OpenType is unmerited, because if we want OpenType support
    in word processors, then it is up to the developers of those programs, not to
    the creators of OpenType fonts."

  body: "Eric,\r\n\r\nNo need for an apology. I had no problem with anything you said.
    I agree with you. I was just trying to explain the difficulties of huge corporate
    institutions and how they are more a collection of disconnected parts rather than
    a dynamic whole acting with united reasoning. In the cases of both Microsoft and
    Adobe, the type groups are perhaps the least powerful forces of their respective
    corporations. They do battle internally with both bean counters and application
    groups who get much more attention from the CEO and board of directors then the
    few type geeks trying to explain their case.\r\nI really admire guys like Thomas,
    Eric, Miguel, and Si for their dedication and continued effort on behalf of typography
    in the face of internal pressures from other sectors of their companies.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
