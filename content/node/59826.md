body: "hello,\r\n\r\nis there a posibility to make different glyphs for the same character
  in the same word if a character repeats? for example if there's a word - Weezer.
  when first e comes, then second e goes from another glyph. how to make it? and if
  there's a word WIDOW - how to make the second w in the word to be different? "

  body: i've searched and read threads about other interesting calt and other features,
    but i cannot find any that could help me in this situation. perhaps i don't know
    specific key words that would show the right info. as many font making stuff is
    new to me, i find tons of pages to read, so typophile helps me anyway...

    calt {\r\n  sub e e' by e.calt;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nThis swithces the second e to
    e.calt whenever it comes after e.\r\n\r\nThat other one is a little bit more complicated,
    and cant write it out directly now... sorry.\r\n"
