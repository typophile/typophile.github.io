  and their website. I don't know this for sure, but it has to be one of the most
  used, if not THE most used websites in the UK. Whenever I want to find out about
  something, be it weather, news, or sport, this is where I go. I guess overall people
  respect the BBC. They assume content both in web editorial and television is more
  honorable than television or news companies that generate their revenue solely from
  advertising. There is little doubt that the BBC is one of the most recognized.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
  this site has a massive amount of information on it. It has reviews of all kinds,
  news, games, video...basically you name it and it is a surprise if the BBC don\u2019t
  feature it. So obviously usability is a massive issue here. It needs to be kept
  simple, and easy to navigate.\r\n\r\nSo why the new site. Actually I should probably
  clarify that a little. It is not technically a new site. Yet more, in the words
  of the designers a \u201Csite refresh\u2026like gardeners doing a bit of pruning
  and weeding, but not digging it up and starting from scratch\". A lot of the site
  is infact pretty much the same as the old one. And why not? In my opinion it was
  always quite a good site in terms of usability. So the site is more just updated
  visually, to look a bit more modern.\r\n\r\nSo my thoughts. Well, I like it. Its
  simple, and it certainly looks more modern. It also has a lighter feel, which makes
  it seem more accessible. I am not sure if this is the case or not, but the text
  feels larger, maybe this is just good visual design, but it certainly has a more
  readable feel to it.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, it still has its usability. I always
  think with websites of this magnitude, you need to clearly separate the sections
  and the BBC does this with simple colour. And I think it works. I have certainly
  found it quite easy to use. I guess sometimes a site like this needs to be got used
  to a little to get used to it, but it generally works. Lots of information is available
  on the front page, and you can also click the headers such as news or sport which
  take you through to the relevant sections. Some discussion forums have suggested
  it is too crowded on the front page, making it difficult. But I think its ok. I
  mean you need to present the information, right? So the viewers can see what options
  they have.\r\n\r\nIt is also consistent. Each section looks pretty much the same
  with the header consistent. Some do change, such as the main front page and the
  news section, but again it is consistent enough to keep pushing its own style recognisability.\r\n\r\nIt
  also has massive improved features of user-interactivity, which I think is awesome.
  You can customize the colour, and also information can be customized depending on
  the user. The local news and weather is displayed when the user types in his or
  her postcode.\r\n\r\nSo overall, yeah I like it. But I will say this. For me, so
  many websites begin to look the same now. They all seem to use a kind of gradient
  glass like effect, and follow suit of sites such as apple. Also this shine is used
  on buttons. I guess we maybe have an obsession to bringing some 3d-ness to websites.
  This gives the impression that the light is reflecting, or that the site has actual
  \u2018real buttons\u2019. For me its too much like just throwing a load of gloss
  on something, or chucking a load of photoshop filters s on to bring it to life.
  The design fundamentals are all there, its simple and elegant, so maybe they could
  hold back on the gloss. Perhaps we need to embrace the web for what it is rather
  than attempting to make it look like its not the web!\r\n\r\nSo what are your thoughts?
  I would love to hear what you guys make of the BBC site, or just of my article.
  What can I do to make it better?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.freddesign.co.uk\r\nhttp://www.freddesign.co.uk/2008/04/archive/the-new-look-bbc-website/\r\n"

    The designers appear to be balancing between a branded network site and a very
    neutral news site, and in the process it seems like a whole lot of images just
    aren\u2019t loading or something. The negative space needs to feel more purposeful,
    even if it\u2019s just hit with a light gray, err, grey, fill."

  body: Thanks for the comment James. I know what you mean, it al,most defaults back
    to its old format after the front page doesnt it. I find a few websites tend to
    do that.

    of page http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/ changes the overall colour scheme.
