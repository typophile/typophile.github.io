  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, <BR> <BR>Background: company is a consultancy that works with rail operators to update,  <BR>redevelop and improve rail and bus interchanges in the UK. <BR> <BR>I'm currently concepting for a new logo and brand for them. The company in question  <BR>(Transport Interchange Consultants) has a rather unwieldy name, and prefers to be  <BR>known by it's acronym, TIC, so this has to feature heavily in the design. <BR> <BR>I've come up with a few ideas (and variations on them), I'll post them all up, so any  <BR>opinions would be gratefully recieved on all ideas. The idea behind the mark was  <BR>to echo crossing tracks/roads. Apologies for the numerous files! <BR> <BR>[I can't get the image upload to work as the board 'crashes' when I post, so I have  <BR>to link, if any mods can fix this and put the images inline I would be most grateful!) <BR> <BR><a href="http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_1_2_3.gif" target="_blank">http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_1_2_3.gif</a> <BR><a href="http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_2a_b_c.gif" target="_blank">http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_2a_b_c.gif</a> <BR><a href="http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_3a_b_c.gif" target="_blank">http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_3a_b_c.gif</a> <BR><a href="http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_3b_d_e.gif" target="_blank">http://tic.nivelo.co.uk/tic_logos_3b_d_e.gif</a> <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time, <BR> <BR>Jordan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I also favour the 2 series. I prefer the full name underneath as in concept 2 (integrating it too tightly into the logo as it is on the right, may cause problems down the line), but it looks a little delicate, and could be risky in small applications (assuming it will always be required). Maybe tighten back the tracking and increase the size? <BR> <BR>I think the balance between the type and the mark needs a good looking at. The mark is being overpowered, even by the lightest type weights. <BR> <BR>Andriy's idea might help solve another possible problem - that the mark may be perceived as a 'sparkle'/lens flare, rather than a crossing of routes. Maybe you could give it some 3D skew to give the effect of it laying on the ground. Possibly not even flat - you could suggest a few hills. <BR> <BR> <BR>By the way, where in Manchester are you?

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you both for your comments. It's interesting (to me anyway) that my concept  <BR>2 is getting so much attention here; on another forum I've asked for opinions on (a design <BR>but non-type-specific one), concept 3 received almost universal initial approval! It's also  <BR>interesting to note that the ultra black weight scored a total of zero votes, with the  <BR>designers preferring lighter, more balanced weights (while I rather liked the ultra  <BR>black).  <BR> <BR>Maybe there's something about type focused people that draws us to different types of  <BR>design&hellip;. Anyway I digress. <BR> <BR>Andriy&ndash; <BR>I agree that it would make it interesting, but I fear it would make it look like even  <BR>more of a 'starburst' than it already does. If I am to lead with concept 2 then the <BR>symbolism of the mark needs to be emphasised rather than diminished. Nice idea  <BR>though! <BR> <BR>Danny&ndash; <BR>My only problem with the full name underneath is that the 'consultants' bit gets a  <BR>little lost trailing off. The length of the name is a real pain when trying to set it  <BR>with such a short acronym! We all love a challenge though eh? <BR> <BR>The balance is something that's a serious issue with the 2 series, as the mark is so <BR>light. I love the idea of skewing it and making it look like it's running over terrain,  <BR>though to be honest, I wouldn't know where to start. I'm not a '3D' guy! <BR> <BR>My personal preference is for the 3d/e designs, though maybe with the name under the <BR>design rather than integrated to the side. <BR> <BR>Jordan <BR> <BR>PS I work out of Knutsford but I live in the city centre (I go through Stockport every  <BR>morning on the train!)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Concept 3 has a more memorable logo than 1 and 2.  It appears like it is doing more work.  I like it because it focuses on a single interchange. Remember, without the first connection the thousands of others would be irrelavant. Plus people will relate that style of mark to transportation due to it's simplicity. It is almost as if you are taking a generic railroad crossing sign and making it more efficient and aggressive in it's appearance. Anyway 3 is my favorite. 1 and 2 are overkill.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like both the 2 series and 3D and 3E. <BR> <BR>The 2 series has a lighter, more high-tech feel, but 3D/E say railroad to me immmediately and the mark just has so much more punch. If you're trying to include buses, I'm not sure such a rail-centric design would be good, so the 2's may be your best bet (I prefer 2B). If that isn't a concern, I'd go with 3D or 3E. <BR> <BR>3F-H are pretty busy and I don't think they hold together like the earlier versions. 3H creates a nice interchange/weaving path from the 'C' to 'Transport' and 'Consultants', however.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've also see the 3a-c mark used by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and can easily see that drawn on punk rock kids with a sharpie marker. In that aspect, it's not exclusive enough for a logo. Although, it is the strongest graphic symbol of the group (probably why people have see it used elsewhere).  <BR> <BR>If you had not given background on the project, I would have never thought of anything having to do with rail operators. The marks presented made me think of bandages, &quot;X marks the spot&quot;, celestial bodies, candy canes, striped suspenders, bows, ribbons&hellip;  <BR> <BR>I like the stacking of the name, the orange and the modern type. I think with an even a stronger typeface, you can do without a mark altogether.  The spacing of the words and the length of the words almost gives the impression of tracks. Instead of making an separate symbol for the logo, perhaps play with the type/color to create a subtle symbol in itself.</div>
