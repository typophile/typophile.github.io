    sure about Fonts.com -- I'd ask first. "

  body: "Um, the EyeWire site (along with the entire Image Club Type Library) was
    purchased by Agfa from Getty Images over three years ago and doesn't function
    anymore. The EyeWire page for Eclat supposedly redirects to the equivalent page
    on Fonts.com, but it ends in a 404.\r\n\r\nThe Fonts.com page for Eclat is actually
    located here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=405832\r\n\r\nI
    can't tell if both the regular the alternate weights are included in the download
    or not. The display for the font certainly doesn't indicate anything."

  body: Oops, I thought Eyewire was still authorized seller of the fonts. But then,
    I never bought (fonts) from them, sorry for a misleading pointer.
