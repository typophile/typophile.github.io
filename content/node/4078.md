  1998. No one has ever been able to identify it, but I appreciate all the efforts.
  I&#39;ve seen it appear on two album covers from ARISTA records. That is all the
  information I can offer. Here are those covers: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.aceofbase.de/discography/singles/cruelsummer/s32front10.jpg"

  body: I am elated. <BR> <BR>Dave, thank you so much. I am amazed that it came down
    to this! I am so happy that it has a name, you have no idea. When I saw it re-appear
    after not seeing it for a few years, I knew for certain it was a font, somewhere.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again! <BR> <BR>James U. <BR><a href="http://www.halloboards.com"
