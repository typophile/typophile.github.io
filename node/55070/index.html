Sounds like something Rogers would say, as he was more given to such broad pronouncements, generally preferred larger types, and was very much one for fine editions.

However, a quick spin through his <em>Pi: A hodge-podge of letters, papers, addresses, written during a period of 60 years</em> didn't reveal anything specific. Sorry.

On the other hand, this is certainly not all about beauty or even just taste: a 16 point font simply cannot be easy to read for the human vision/cognition system (unless it's a large book on a lectern).

It is because of statements like this that <em>I’m not looking to defend or debate the topic until I can find the original reference and context.</em>

In looking over Bruce Rogers' book <em>The Centaur Types</em>, which is set in 16pt Centaur, I find it to be extremely pleasing and easy to read so perhaps my vision/cognition system is inhuman.</div>

Funny, Bruce Rogers, D.B. Updike, Matthew Carter & others thought it would. I am talking metal type, not digital in this case.
In fact it seems 16 point as an "ideal" is not an uncommon opinion as it follows the Jenson models of the 16th century. Of course there are far too many variables to say any one thing is ideal in any situation. The quote I have been looking for is still eluding me but I have enough constructive feedback (mostly via direct email) to help with the research i am doing. Thank you also Dan, Kent & Gerald.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think if you have a font with a small x-height and mucho talus, used in a large book you hold a bit far away, the angle the letters end up subtending on the retina can indeed be good. Because I do believe that's what counts, not half a dozen people's rose-colored vision. Everybody knows type designers can't read.  :-)

Also, obviously it depends on the font! Think of fonts designed for small sizes: they look ugly large - in fact they <em>need</em> to look ugly large. And I've noticed that Baskerville cannot really be Baskerville below like 11pt.

BTW, I personally think that fonts (at least those with conventional proportions) <em>look best</em> -which is of course not at all the same thing as easiest to read- at around 40pt (a size the Bentons seem to have used as a good place to truncate optical scaling), because that makes each glyph fill the hi-res fovea to the max at typical reading distances. Above 40pt you actually have to make multiple fixations on a single glyph to see all of it; essentially you never see all of it! (Unless you put it at a distance.)

		<div class="commentbody">Since this has veered off a bit into a discussion of type size, I'll add.

If indeed 16 point is the ideal size for a "fine press" book, then in the past 30 years the dictum is not well honored. For many years I was associated with the late "Fine Print: the review for the arts of the book," and thus I saw many hundreds of "fine press" books. Type sizes for main text ranged from 8 point to 24 point. & this brings us to John Hudson's point. There was a time when "fine press" book did almost by default indicate a large page size, a page size at which 16 point type might work nicely.

But by the early 1970s the world of "fine printing" had widely expanded, and fine printers were exploring all sorts of page shapes and sizes, often dependent on the size of the presses they could get their hands on.

So I think the 16 point declaration was really tied to a certain milieu. & like all milieux, it had to pass.

Personally, I found 16 point to be a great size to set by hand. My short stubby fingers worked too slowly with smaller type. But I could fly through the case when setting 16.

I have no idea where originated the quote Rich seeks. But it do ring a tiny bell.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Rich

Yes this rings a bell – perhaps you're thinking of Goudy's <em>Typologia</em> (1940, University of California Press). 

It has an end chapter on Fine Printing, and in the conclusion to the chapter on Legibility he states <em>"...many experiments to ascertain at what distance from the eye any certain size of type should be held as determined by the angle with the retina it subtends, but the shape of a letter, which is more important than its size, receives less attention."</em>

Which makes him sound a bit like Hrant ; )

I'm still trawling through it looking for where he might say anything about recommending 16pt as a specific size, but elsewhere we find

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typologia_size_6613.jpg]
