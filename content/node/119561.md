  or slab serif. I'm looking for something bold, with a strong/solid feel. Preferably
  a little bit geometric looking. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

    an idea on what the logo is to market would be nice.\r\n\r\nHennyways and milwaukeeroads,
    why not start off with a heavy weight of Futura, oblique, just to throw something
    into the ring?"
