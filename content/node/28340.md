    Rome :-(\r\n\r\nOh - yeah, you weren't there were you. That's the last ATypI that
    I went to. The food was good, as I'm sure you heard. Actually, a lot of the content
    was good too. On the other hand after Leipzig's content anything would have seemed
    good... But the city made up for it in such a big way - I've never had such huge
    blisters from walking.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
