    come to the conclusion that the use of the font was a calculated move to maximize
    the publicity around his message. \r\n\r\nYou can take that to the bank! :-)\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I would have use the official Cleveland Tourism font as seen here... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY&feature=player_embedded "

    \r\n\r\n\"It's the hot new font. And it's all thanks to Dan Gilbert. In fact,
    I typed up and submitted this column in Comic Sans. Really! (Editorial note: It's
    true. He did. Sigh.)\r\n\r\nSo if you feel like firing off an angry letter today,
    remember that some of America's top executives trust Comic Sans to get their point
    across. Comic Sans: for when you want to show you're sans comedy!\"\r\n"

  body: I'm several years past the point of wanting people to stop using so much Comic
    Sans. Now I would be happy for people to <em>use</em> Comic Sans as much they
    want, as long as they stop <em>talking about</em> Comic Sans.
