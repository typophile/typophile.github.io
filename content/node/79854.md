  attached an image of the kind my quest is directed at. This one was taken from the
  Wrangler Jeans website, and the slabs remind me of pixels. The long search hasn't
  been too fruitful, so I would really appreciate any tips on nice pixel or slabby
  faces.\r\n\r\n-Marjo[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bluebell_3910.jpg]"
