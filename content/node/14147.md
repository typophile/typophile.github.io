  body: "Lots of hugs for anybody who didn't make it. It was a very good time, and
    there was some very cool content. Mario Feliciano's type revivals and Ina Saltz's
    talk on typographic tattoos were particular highlights, I think. Also some of
    the parties held around the conference were a blast.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
