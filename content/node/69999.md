  body: Thanks for the comments. Can you guess what the company does though? Any thoughts
    on how successful this would be as a logotype?

    in the connected version.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest changing the 'T' to lowercase, and
    reversing the swing on the crossbar (I've attached a sketch to show what I mean).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/td_6369.png]\r\n\r\n

    is, by far, my favorite.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what it could be though. Spans

  body: "I read the twisted on the top pretty easy. I like it. But, I've seen many
    an ambigram so I'm an easier sell than the average consumer, like a lot of people
    here, don't you think?\r\n\r\nThe top is much better than the bottom. Bottom looks
    stagnant and forced. Top is so playful and organic. FUN.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Spans from
    Lebanese Restaurant to a Pruning Company?\"</em>...to decorating cakes with frosting."

  body: "Btw, one potential problem is that the i is almost exactly the same character
    as the d.\r\n\r\nAlso just noticed that the s loses that organic nature either
    by way of it's lack of contrast or it's not curvy enough or both."

  body: "The d is definitely the weak point; I'm used to making and reading ambigrams,
    but the end slowed me down and for a few seconds I thought \"Twistel\" (like it
    could be a pretzel brand, though that's not what the style looks like). Try a
    big swash from the left of the T to make a capital D.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing it's
    a soft-serve ice cream/custard place. The dollop on the i successfully says it
    must be something sweet."

  body: "I have to be honest, when I first read it I immediately thought the \"d\"
    was actually an \"l\" so it read \"twistel\" to me until you said it was \"twisted.\"
    The reason being that the \"d\" looked like an \"l\" because of the loop or bowl
    or counter of the d being so low to the baseline. It looks more like and script
    \"l\" with a fancy loop. Also just because one sees the first 3 to 4 letters being
    \"Twis...\" does not mean that everyone is going to know it actually says \"Twisted.\"
    And also remember that the last letter of a word is very important for reasons
    we all know. \r\n\r\nHowever, that said, I think both have something good going
    and I like the script version as well as the second one and I think they both
    have this \"festive\" feel to it. I think there is something you can try with
    the \"s\" perhaps tilting it to the angle of the \"w & e\"? just to see what it
    looks like while sitting diagonally in the middle of the ambigram. Just a suggestion,
    not saying it will work but could be interesting.\r\n\r\nI like the loops and
    the connections between loops but I think you should check your weights. Making
    some of the connections of a heavier stroke or weight could help improve the ambigram.
    It does not entirely bother me but I think some of those connections could be
    heavier and stronger since they look and feel a little flimsy and weak.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    maybe you could try something different with the \"i.\" Maybe you could make more
    of a sleek or thinner tear drop or dot of the \"i.\" I feel they work on the second
    one but for the script version they could be thinner or slicker or something,
    but I feel they are too narrow or wide. \r\n\r\nIts looking good and fun and it
    looks good in black to.\r\n\r\nF  "

  body: "Froy - I hear you about the second half of the word being less strong than
    the first. However, I would argue that having read 'Twis..' there are only so
    many directions the word can go, and your brain almost fills in the rest for you.
    To addition, the more the second half of the word is rendered legible, the less
    the first half is! And I would argue that the first half is more important. \r\n\r\nThe
    rationale behind the line weights is thus: the first version had bits such as
    the 's' with varying weights within the actual letter. To improve legibility (especially
    at a distance - go on, try it, it's actually more legible when you stand back!),
    the joining or decorative lines would become lighter, and the lines making up
    the letter would be heavier. Those lines which are part of the letter in one instance
    and then a joining line in the other would be a middle thickness.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?"

    you were to see this above a shop, I think we can all agree you wouldnt be able
    to read it as instantaneously as other logos. \r\n\r\nTherefore, would this mean
    that you:\r\n\r\na. Lose interest and walk away?\r\nb. Stand there until you've
    worked it out? (and maybe tell someone about it?)\r\nc. Enter the shop to ask
    about it?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"
