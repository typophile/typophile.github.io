    Can we make this into about 10 posts?</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree with Mike. Alejandra,
    next time, it is recommended to limit the number of samples to 10 per post at
    the very most, and to provide a numbering or label system that is less cumbersome
    for the IDers. Also keep in mind: the larger the samples, the better the results.
    It\u2019s for your own benefit.\r\n\r\n<cite>the book-keeping aspect of this is
    too much. I can't keep track of what we have ID'd and what we haven't.</cite>\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
