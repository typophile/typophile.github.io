    especially for your first release. I wouldn't rule out MyFonts if you want to
    reach a wider audience, and hopefully make some money for all your hard work.
    I also sell my stuff through my own website, but the vast majority of  income
    for type sales comes from MyFonts. \r\nAnyway, well done, and I am sure this will
    be the first of many now you have been bitten by the bug. "

  body: "Igor, William, Andreas, sim, Gary, Hrant, Martin: Thanks a bunch! It means
    a great deal to me to get such positive feedback from fellow typedesigners.\r\n\r\nMartin,
    I've been absent a while myself, but thanks a lot! The (very) basic character
    set of the serif is pretty much finalized, but I wouldn't expect a release anytime
    soon. I'm having very little time for typedesign at the moment, and the redrawn
    Proza Web, and Proza Display have my priority.\r\n\r\nOn marketing: The marketing
    of fonts is not as simple as you paint it. Having a succesful typefoundry is as
    much about your reputation as it is about your work, especially if you want to
    do client based work in the future. Myfonts, despite its superior position in
    font sales, is mostly a shitpile of crappy typefaces. I would advise any starting
    typedesigner to join the fontshop before joining myfonts, establishing some sort
    of a professional reputation before going for the big money. \r\n\r\nI've been
    in contact with Myfonts though, and I'm really impressed with the way they're
    improving the quality of their library, so I've decided to join them sooner or
    later.\r\n\r\nNick, yes that's right. Let's hope you're right :)"

  body: I've stopped caring hrant. I wrote an entire article on the development of
    Proza (http://ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/), and
    I've been open about the design process from the very start, so it's certainly
    not a rip-off. That, and I am certainly not the only one who feels there's enough
    room between Cronos and Proza. It might turn out to be hard to rid myself of this
    rip-off reputation, but if I continue to deliver original quality over the coming
    years, I'm confident I'll get there. That's all I have left to say.

  body: "Oh you certainly need to guard the reputation of your type foundry, but from
    my perspective anyway releasing your work through MyFonts doesn't harm your reputation.
    As far as I'm concerned it actually establishes/verifies your reputation.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I don't like Fontshop. I go there once in a while if a typeface can't be found
    elsewhere, but it's definitely not a go-to spot for me when it comes to typefaces.
    I'm convinced by the quality of the fonts but I just don't like the website itself.
    You will probably find that most typefaces from Fontshop are also released through
    MyFonts, so I think it's an overgeneralisation when you say most fonts on MyFonts
    are crap. You can say that about websites like Dafont but MyFonts does a lot more
    quality control. They probably don't do as much quality control as Fontshop but
    they make up for that with their categorisation and validation systems. I find
    you actually have to work to get to the subpar fonts because the system is built
    on showcasing the most popular works, of which most have been validated by end
    users. The system works so well in fact that I'm always aware of most professional
    new releases and award nominations shortly after their release. In the end I actually
    get the feeling that MyFonts and Fontshop are more similar than you might think
    in terms of quality of fonts. It's just that Fontshop's target audience are generally
    professional designers while MyFonts speaks to a larger audience.\r\n\r\nI think
    you can rightfully say that being on Fontshop helps to establish and validate
    your reputation, but I doubt being on MyFonts harms your reputation. I think perhaps
    you're thinking too much of the value of exclusivity regarding foundries like
    TEFF and Dutch Type Library. They don't offer their fonts on MyFonts because it's
    not a similar target audience. With Proza you ARE speaking to a similar target
    audience, and so rather than a clever marketing strategy I think you're just excluding
    part of your target audience. Also, the fact that you're giving away a weight
    for free to me goes against the notion of exclusivity. I just don't think exclusivity
    is necessarily as important as you make it out to be."
