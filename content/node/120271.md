  typeface \"HOLLYWOOD COSTUME\" is displayed on the front page of this site. Saw
  it in print when walking past LACMA and although it reminds me of a humanist Futura
  a little bit, I haven't been able to figure out what it is exactly..but it's beautiful
  and bold!\r\nThanks in advance"

    like bold is the best weight for the match.\r\nAlso bear in mind the well known

    the letters in the poster are actually a lighter weight than Futura PT Bold! See
    how visual perception is a trickster.\r\nDear reader, you don't have to believe
    me. You can duplicate these results using a screen grab of the original image,
    which is larger scale than shown here, and edit to reverse colors.\r\nDon"
