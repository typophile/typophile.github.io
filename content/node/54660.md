  desire for getting along in polite society have long tempted the fancy of aspiring
  souls, following are the musings of beautiful and enchanting young Undine Spragg,
  newcomer to the travails of the cosmopolitan dream:\r\n\r\n\u201CShe went to the
  window, and drawing back its many layers of lace gazed eastward down the long brown-stone
  perspective. Beyond the Park lay Fifth Avenue\u2013and Fifth Avenue was where she
  wanted to be!\r\n\r\nShe had read in the \u2019Boudoir Chat\u2019 of one of the
  Sunday papers that the smartest women were using the new pigeon-blood note-paper
  with white ink; and rather against her mother\u2019s advice she had ordered a large
  supply, with her monogram in silver. It was a disappointment, however, to that Mrs.
  Fairford wrote on the old-fashioned white sheet, without even a monogram\u2013simply
  her address and telephone number.\u201D\u2013Edith Wharton, The Custom of the Country,
