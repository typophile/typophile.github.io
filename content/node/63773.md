  body: "The Library of Congress have tons of pictures on flickr this is the search
    result for [[http://tiny.cc/5RgKc|World War 2]].\r\nNow the cool thing about their
    flickr images is that they all have a description that ends with something called
    \"Persistent URL\" if you click that it'll take you to their website where you
    can click the thumbnail to get a page like [[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/I?fsac:1:./temp/~pp_Lb0N::displayType=1:m856sd=fsac:m856sf=1a35220:@@@fsa|this]].
    In this example it's a photograph of a tank and you have access to a 191 Megabytes
    TIFF.\r\nMost of the images they put on flickr don't have restrictions on reproduction
    and publication."

    are saying that, to the best of the LoC's knowledge, <em>probably</em> all are
    OK to use, but that the responsnibility (as always) is on the person who uses
    the image to accept responsibility for any repercussions (and that the LoC doesn't
    provide any protection or guarantees, other than presenting what information it
    has about a particular image). At least that's how I read it.\r\n\r\nIt is still
    use at your own risk, even if that risk is only 0.00001%."
