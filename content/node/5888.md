body: We are using an old font, Font Company Garamond Light for one of our publications.
  Using OS X and InDesign, I notice that the font conflicts w/ ITC Garamond, even
  when not open. I believe these fonts are very close; there are 16 fonts within each
  typeface, corresponding to each other. <BR> <BR>Anyone know the origin on The Font
  Company&#39;s Garamond vs. Adobe&#39;s ITC Garamond? Were they based on the same
  glyphs? They don&#39;t substitute exactly -- I need to bump up size of ITC to correspond
  to the Font Company&#39;s size.

  body: I would say that they are they same. From what I can tell from looking at
    old samples. Do you have samples of each that you can post for us? <BR> <BR>&#40;moving

  body: Thanks for moving my thread. I am a newbie and should have realized this is
    more of an ID question. <BR> <BR>Is it legal to post the fonts? I would like someone
    to take a look at ITC Garamond, and LGarmond Light &#40;Font Company&#41;.
