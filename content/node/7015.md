body: I received a printed copy of a document with the following font as a header.  As
  displayed on the screen it looked like the attached image.  However, it was described
  as SWIS721 BLKEX BT when I looked at the font format.  I don&#39;t know much about
  font substitution, but I believe that is what may have happened.  <BR> <BR>Does
  anyone recognize the original font?  I searched and it is similar to AGENCY FB Bold.  The
  scan was horrible, it is a very clean font in reality. <BR>  <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/50567.jpg"

  body: Thanks guys.  That looks like a winner.  Is it improper to ask if there is
    a shareware or freeware equivalent on this site?
