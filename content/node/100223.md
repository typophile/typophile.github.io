body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logo design where the client wants the word
  to be all uppercase: it's an acronym. The word includes an uppercase I, and I suspect
  that the logotype will be friendlier to read if I dot it.\r\n\r\nI don't want to
  identify the name of the client here, but it's similar to SPRITE.\r\n\r\nFor the
  uppercase I, I'm echoing the lowercase i's design while keeping the weight of the
  uppers.\r\n\r\nI need your expert opinions: Where's the best place to put the dot
  ... above the cap height, or down a bit with the I shorter than the other caps?
  Any rules of thumb? \r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: If you're 'echoing the lowercase i's design' and putting a tittle on it, then
    it's lowercase, and I don't understand the question. And considering that a logo
    is essentially a design and not text, it's up to your aesthetic tastes and the
    overall look whether the tittle rises above the height of the other letters or
    not.

    normal rules. But there certainly are examples of other companies using unusual
    capitalization in product names and logos to be distinctive, such as Apple's \"i\"
    products (iMac, iPhone, etc.). I remember that when the iMac first came out, some
    news articles wrote it as \"Imac\".\r\n\r\nCan't offer an opinion about which
    looks better in your logo without seeing layouts of both versions."

    are breaking it. I guess it's hard to post your work in progress when even the
    name is classified, but \u2013 very general speaking, if you were making a logo
    design for Sprite, I'd start of with the dot underneath the cap height, so it
    would read SPRiTE and go from there. "

    Just use letters as close to the actual ones as possible, without breaching confidentiality.
    You\u2019ll find you get better a better response if you show people what you
    have already tried before asking for help. In addition, it is considered polite
    to use your full name in your profile. It has also been my experience that if
    you use your real name as your screen name, you tend to get more and better feedback.
    Good luck out there, and remember, may the fonts be with you\u2122."

    proportions have been altered, some terminal constructions changed and overall
    \u201Csoftening\u201D applied. It\u2019s all a bit much, no matter how pleasing
    or effective the \uFB01nished result, because the design does not establish its
    own identity\u2014the modi\uFB01cations being piecemeal and unrelated, unable
    to escape the fundamental presence of Meta asserting itself.\r\n\r\nThe reason
    that types such as Gotham and Avenir are successful developments of obvious sources
    is that, \uFB01rst, they are not informed by so idiosyncratic a design as Meta,
    and secondly, they restrict themselves to one primary thematic counterpoint to
    the original."
