  and someone came to the conclusion that it would have to be Castcraft/OPTIFonts'
  Eton. Now, first of all, I've been doing some research on this OPTIFonts and people
  on forums like these doesn't hold them in such a high regard, eh? ;)\r\n\r\nWell,
  I'm with you. The website is just an outrage, because I can't reach their font catalogue
  and see if this Eton is the actual font I'm looking for. So now I turn to you guys
  & gals. Here's the text sample:\r\nhttp://wtf.myfonts.com/images/4b/4baaa9e85b5ddbeb9fedba44e12035d6.43347.jpeg\r\nBefore
  the OPTIFonts information someone mentioned it was originally issued by VGC (Visual
  Graphics Corporation, http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/vgc-typefaces.html) as Wexford
  Medium and later on digitalized by the dreaded OPTIFonts, if this is to any help.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? If you need more samples, I can get a hold of them for you, but they'll be
  relatively small. Thanks in advance!"

    Limited Futura ripoff, mind you) and this case is a-closed.

    a seemingly very active and helpful user, would either lie or mix the Fontware
    Limited up with OPTIFonts in some way.\r\n\r\nOh well, perhaps we'll see it in
    the future. Are there any fonts similiar to Wexford (Medium)? Like Banjoman, Blippo,
    Argentica or Bernhard Gothic from that page bowpinpw provided."

    me.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font which I believe to be called Opti Schow Light.
    I have scoured the web though, and have had no luck in finding anything. Do you
    know of the existence of such a font? Do you have any idea where I may be able
    to obtain it? If not do you know of an equivalent?\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance!"

    they determined that the name of the font is in fact Schow Light by OPTIFonts.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know where I might be able to find this font?\r\n\r\nI've searched all
    over for both OPTIFonts and CastCraft who I believe owned them at one point, but
    I have been unable to find a working website for either of them. It's almost as
    though both companies have disappeared. Any ideas???\r\n\r\nThanks"

    IDing fonts at alt.binaries.fonts that there were copies of Opti fonts being circulated,
    but the RIGHT way to go about it is to find out the true identity for the font
    and find a legal version. Almost nothing offered by Opti was original, and most
    are available from other sources by other names.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
