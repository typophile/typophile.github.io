body: After going through the grinder of naming my business Creative Squeeze I am
  finding that developing one&#39;s own identity is extremely difficult. Rather than
  focusing on the objectives of the design, I am constantly dealing with emotions
  and opinions. I have hit the sketchbook and funneled with friends to arrive at these
  two design directions. Typophiles

    of squeezed toothpaste, paint tubes, condiments &#40;ketchup/mustard&#41;, and
    most of all lots and lots of citrus fruit and juice drops. It made for some nice
    visuals, but was too literal. I sense that the bulging/squeezing letters &#40;3rd
    design from the top&#41; concern you as being too literal

  body: 'To give you an idea of how_much/what_kind of &#34;literality&#34; I think
    might be good: like half a lemon is obviously too much, but a drop shape might
    be great. Like you&#39;re getting the last drop of benefit out of projects. Maybe
    just a drop shape between &#34;creative&#34; and &#34;squeeze&#34;, with possibly
    a progressive &#40;but subtle&#41; narrowing of the letters the closer they are
    to the middle. <BR> <BR>The one with the wavy bulging/squeezing letters: I think
    the problem with it is simply that it&#39;s too cheesy, too much squeeze ecstasy
    or something. Plus it looks like a suspension bridge or an audio company. <BR>
    <BR>As for the Windows thing: <BR>- I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very pronounced.
    I didn&#39;t see it. <BR>- As much as some people &#40;like me&#41; can&#39;t
    stand the beast, most layman actually like MS. But since you&#39;re a design outfit
    &#40;an area of Mac-worship&#41; the MS connotation would indeed be a negative.
    <BR>- Those &#34;E&#34;s don&#39;t really say much anyway. Or maybe they say tickle,
    but not squeeze. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    tickling &#34;E&#39;s&#34;. I have spent some time this afternoon on some concepts
    that I think are saying a little more. I&#39;m still not in love with the &#34;E&#39;s&#34;
    on the concept second from the bottom. If I was designing something wicked, using
    black and red instead of gray and orange, I think I&#39;d be onto something

  body: Well, the geometric face would lend itself more to lateral manipulation, so
    in that way it&#39;s versatile. That said, I don&#39;t like any of the three logos
    that use it...  :-&#40; <BR> <BR>The Gill would certainly be more resistant to
    the ravages of time, so to speak, and it&#39;s not bland. Of the bottom two I&#39;d
    say the first is a bit too... sexual or something, but I think the drop-as-tail
    on the &#34;Q&#34; holds promise, if you can make it more noticeable, and more
    integrated into the letterform. You could also try making the inside counter of
    the &#34;Q&#34; drop-shaped. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Just a quick piece of feedback - I prefer the double &#34;ee&#34; in  &#34;Squeeze&#34;
    highlighted, while Creative stands alone. Plucking out letters from both words
    is too symmetrical and dilutes the concept. <BR> <BR>I would also add that I think
    the literal route is not the best avenue to explore- you are doing a good job
    of bringing in the &#34;citrus&#34; concept simply by your color selection. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe I missed it, but did you manipulate the Q? It looks smaller than the
    other letters- how does it look with a proper descending tail? <BR> <BR>jb <BR>

    those projects that pay the bills, I haven&#39;t had much time to focus on Creative
    Squeeze. <BR> <BR>The following concepts explore the &#34;Q-drop&#34; that was
    initiated in my last round from the concept where I embarrassingly left out the
    &#34;U&#34; in SQUEEZE. So I won&#39;t be winning any spelling bee&#39;s, but
    hopefully one of these concepts will take me into a direction that is acceptable
    at all necessary levels. <BR> <BR>I am personally leaning toward the Clarendon
    logo, as the &#34;Q&#34; has some fun personality while the logo in its entirety
    maintains corporate appeal

    and a long name is very present. <BR> <BR>But yes, I think that sometimes some
    colors fits better than others on a particular type, sometimes for visual reasons
    &#40;it is hard to use yellow with thin type&#41; and sometimes for other reasons
    like the shapes of the type, in a general way I think I prefer a green flashy
    clarendon than a trajan. <BR> <BR>I think it is the same with other things, the
    cars for example, if you could buy a Ferrari, would you chose a dark blue? I don&#39;t
    think so, even if you were an old minister your doubt would be red, maybe yellow,
    the dark blue for the Jaguar. The submarines are a special case, I like yellow
    for them.'
