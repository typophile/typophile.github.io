  body: It's most likely machine-set. The sample is similar to Linotype Bodoni, but
    it's not the same face; perhaps it's a Ludlow Monotype face based on Bodoni or
    Century.

  body: "Thanks Nick\r\n\r\nThey did have 3 Linotypes in 1909 but got rid of 2 of
    them when they got into serious financial difficulties. I was presuming they'd
    gotten rid of the 3rd one by 1914 (no trace of it or its operator in their records)
    but they might have hung onto it. They definitely didn't have a Monotype machine.\r\n\r\nThey
    also used what I think is Doric for emphasis \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample

  body: My Linotype specimen books pairs Linotype DeVinne with Gothic No. 4, which
    appears to be a pretty close match to your samples.
