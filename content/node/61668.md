  layout. Is there any standard that it follow or why certain chars are put in certain
  places. \r\n\r\nI am currently involves in designing a keyboard for \"jawi\", a
  script for malay language that use arabic with 6 additional characters. there are
  many design for jawi keyboards, but we are looking at a way  to standardize the
  layout for general users."

  body: "In the dark ages (when the only way to know what other \"exotic\" type designers
    were doing was call people, get some names, then call those, ad continuum - something
    I never did) I designed my own keyboard layouts for Armenian, Arabic, Hebrew,
    Cyrillic, Vietnamese, and who knows what else. Assuming there really is no standard*
    you can go about this in one of two ways: either shoot for making novices comfortable,
    or making professionals efficient. The former involves mapping the letters to
    the closest equivalents on the Qwerty keyboard. This is not as hopeless as it
    seems, even for something like Arabic (or Jawi). The advantage of a phonetic mapping
    is quick and pleasant pickup by all users. This is what I did for Armenian in
    the 80s** since back then people -especially Armenians- were still afraid of computers
    to begin with; even today it helps gentle souls get in on the game. In contrast
    the latter approach involves making typing efficient*** by arranging the letters
    very thoughtfully according to frequency and frequency of <em>sequence</em> (like
    putting \"t\" and \"h\" so that you can type them quickly, not putting much where
    the left pinkie is, etc.). This is of course a lot more work, and because it requires
    much more memorization from the get-go it causes a lot of people to complain,
    and some people to give up. The good news is that these days you can do <em>both</em>,
    and give each user a choice.\r\n\r\n* And if there is, assuming it's not a disaster.\r\n\r\n**
    This layout I made ended up in Windows XP, although I'm still trying to get at
    least a credit for that... I'll be making some determined moves towards that end
    at this year's ATypI conference.\r\n\r\n*** Although we know what happened to
    the Dvorak keyboard...  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    mid term and long term.\r\nIf you have a long term user in mind, go for the most
    logical, fast and complete layout for the language. It will not become popular
    anytime soon but it is the right thing to do.\r\nFor the short and mid term, particularly
    if the user familiar with English keyboard layout is in mind, and someone who
    does not use the layout full time, a phonetic mapping on QWERTY English is more
    practical.\r\nWe made a QWERTY Persian keyboard layout for Mac which was an instant
    hit among Iranian Mac users, almost all of them residing abroad. But for the use
    of a nation, efficiency and completeness should take the priority.\r\nPersian
    has a government standard based on keyboard layout used on MS platform which itself
    is a derivative of MS Arabic layout. So I don't have to be worried about the Persian
    standard.\r\nbtw thanks hrant for the info. Now I know who to blame for this awful
    awful Persian standard :-)"

  body: "Actually my Arabic/Farsi layout was a very niche thing (it was made for video
    titling on the Amiga, although some people did use it for typesetting small ads
    in a yellow pages), so it was nothing even close to a standard. The nice thing
    about it though was that it was completely \"typable\" - no need for any keyboard
    software whatsoever. It's my Armenian layout that's in Windows. BTW, could somebody
    please show me what Armenian layout(s) MacOS uses these days?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    also using my keyboard. No crediting, nothing. The problem with Apple is, they
    have an even \"better\" deaf ear than MS... Is anybody from Apple going to Mexico
