  body: "I think you are going to continue to be frustrated, because these are probably
    not fonts, and many may not even be based on typefaces. The stonecutters developed
    their own styles. If you know dates from any of these please add that information,
    as it helps rule out typefaces that are too new to have been used. Unless these
    were made after about mid-1980's there were almost certainly no fonts used.\r\n\r\n-
