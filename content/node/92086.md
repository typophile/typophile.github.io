  was wondering if there is an un-distressed original to this font? Trade Gothic Bold
  Condensed is close, although the \"Q\" is different. And it should perhaps be a
  little bolder?"

    seems to share the same letter shapes."

    the grotesques, but can't find a perfect match. Still nobody?

    at $9) so it was top of mind.
