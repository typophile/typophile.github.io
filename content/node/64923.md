  the <em>Type[&]Design 2009</em> conference session at the Royal Academy of Art on
  the 19th of November, David Lemon gave a presentation on his proposal for \u2018glyph
  completeness\u2019 in OpenType fonts via Acrobat Connect. Although the audience
  could see him, David had to do his presentation without any visible contact with
  the other side. Also he had to talk slowly, because of the slightly delayed sound.
  Although both speaker and audience considered the session to be somewhat surreal,
  the presentation was highly appreciated. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nBelow one can find links
  to the slides (PDF format) of David Lemon\u2019s presentation and of the other T[&]D
  2009 conference ones. A PDF of Thomas Milo\u2019s talk will follow shortly.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDavid

  body: "Thanks for that reading list! Judging from the titles alone, I think I'm
    going to read <em>all</em> of it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA first question. Dr. J\xFCrgen
    Willrodt mentions, somewhat offhand, \"OTF: Italic glyphs are included as a feature\",
    in his overview of the current OTF status. From the context I understand it's
    targeted at CJK fonts, rather than 'regular' use as italics. Still, I'm a bit
    mystified, as 'ital' (or something like that) does not appear in his list of CJK
    Support features (p. 54). What's behind this 'ital' story? (See also the image
    on p. 58!)"

  body: "The main point for mentioning the italic feature in Adobes CJK fonts was
    the different way to implement some italic glyphs in the font for OTF and TTF.
    \r\nAs mentioned Adobes OTF fonts are doing it via feature support whereas standard
    japanese TTF fonts are supporting italic glyphs via the construction of a TTC
    file.\r\nIt just means that there are two incompatible ways to support italic
    glyphs in japanese fonts.  "

    'fire' and 'dangerous things') ...

  body: "Theunis: <em>[...] \u2018ital\u2019 (or something like that) [...]'</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFrom
    the OpenType Layout tag registry \u2018definitions and implementations\u2019:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Tag:
    \u2018ital\u2019</strong>\r\n<em>Friendly name:</em> Italics\r\n<em>Registered
    by:</em> Adobe\r\n<em>Function:</em> Some fonts (such as Adobe's Pro Japanese
    fonts) will have both Roman and Italic forms of some characters in a single font.
    This feature replaces the Roman glyphs with the corresponding Italic glyphs.\r\n<em>Example:</em>
    The user would apply this feature to replace B with B.\r\n<em>Recommended implementation:</em>
    The ital table maps the Roman forms in a font to the corresponding Italic forms
    (GSUB lookup type 1).\r\n<em>Application interface:</em> For GIDs found in the
    ital coverage table, the application passes the GIDs to the table and gets back
    one new GID for each.\r\n<em>UI suggestion:</em> When a user selects text and
    applies an Italic style, an application should check for this feature and use
    it if present.\r\n<em>Script/language sensitivity:</em> Applies mostly to Latin;
    note that many non-Latin fonts contain Latin as well.\r\n<em>Feature interaction:</em>
    This feature may be used in combination with other substitution (GSUB) features,
    whose results it may override. In CJKV fonts it should activate the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/Typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#kern\">kern</a>
    feature (which would be on anyway in other scripts).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n"

  body: Thank you, Frank and whoever else is responsible, for making these presentations
    available. I especially enjoyed your talk about font modeling. I have played around
    a bit with the little app you made available, but didn't realize how much more
    thinking was behind it.

    and made the presentations available on River Valley TV.\r\n\r\nLater next year
    a more sophisticated version of LeMo will become available. The interface will
    change subsequently, if only to give the larger number of (exceptions on) parameters
    a place.\r\n"
