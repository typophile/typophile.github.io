  the following font for my company logo? The designer who did it for us has since

  body: "That's assuming it ever was a font. If this logo is the only usage (now or
    planned), it would likely be easiest to redraw it (or have it redrawn) as a vector
    file which you can then resize and scale to your heart's content.\r\n\r\nBut if
    it <em>is</em> a font, one of the sparrows on the Type ID Board will likely know.
    They specialise in this type of request."
