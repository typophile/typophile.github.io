    don't think that's the one. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/superstar|Superstar]]
    ITC is closer but you'd have to remove the outline stroke.\r\nMore: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamante|Diamante]],

  body: "MINOR EDIT:\r\nAs far as I can see, \"SF Hollywood Hills\" has the same letterforms
    as the solid version of \"SF Collegiate Solid\" with raised and lowered letter
    positioning that produces a \"bouncy\" result when you type a _HOLLYWOOD_, or
    anything else for that matter.\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/sf-collegiate.font?text=RAIN&back=author\r\nDon"
