    There are some older versions with 10.4 PPC builds already in existence, which
    would be easier than building it yourself from source:\r\n[[http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Font-Tools/FontForge.shtml]]"

  body: "Thanks for your answer. Unfortunately, I have tryed FontForge, but impossible
    to make it run. It seems that a lot of people have had same kind of problems.
    My english is probably not good enough to understand the technical answers that
    have been made on the web. Anyway, FF seems to be quite difficult to tame on a
    10.4.11.\r\nHaving post on an another forum, I have had the suggestion to swift
    to 10.5 and use Glyphs. So I have downloaded 10.5.6 on Softonic. I will clean
    and back up my PPC before installing and trying Glyphs... "
