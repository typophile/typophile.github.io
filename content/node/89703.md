  body: There are some out there for much less too! My own copy also has ink splattered
    on the cover, and a single set of illustrations cut out and taped back in. I don't
    know how much it cost, though, as it was a gift.

  body: This one has nothing cut out of it.  Looks like it wasn't used very much.  Mine
    also has some white splatters on the cover of it but faint.

  body: "I got mine for around $125, I think, about a decade ago. It's in good condition.
    I could see a fine copy going for maybe $200. But unless it\u2019s very fine,
    pristine actually, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll get $350. \r\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t
    see the biggest market for this being serious book collectors, so condition is
    less of a value. As long as the pages are clear, most type hounds will be happy
    to save a couple hundred and get a fair or good copy and don\u2019t need pristine.\r\n\r\nStill,
    can\u2019t hurt to start as an asking price, I suppose. Good luck."
