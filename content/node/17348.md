  by [[Mark Simonson]] in 2005, Proxima Nova is a complete reworking of his [[Proxima
  Sans]] from 1994. The original six fonts (three weights with italics) have been
  expanded to 42 full-featured [[OpenType]] fonts. Proxima Nova straddles the gap
  between typefaces like [[Futura]] and [[Akzidenz Grotesk]]. The result is a hybrid
  combining [[humanistic]] proportions with a somewhat [[geometric]] appearance.\r\n\r\n<strong>On
