  body: "In InDesign CS 3  we added support for a character to represent non-stretching
    non-breaking spaces because the original implementation (non-breaking spaces don't
    stretch) was incorrect. The option is in the same Type > menu:\r\n * Non-breaking
    space - u00A0 (NO-BREAK SPACE)\r\n * Non-breaking, non-stretching space - u202F
    (NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE)\r\nWe didn't strecth u00A0 in the beginning because the
    work-around that Kent describes was considered workable. However, especially in
    the Czech & Polish market, this method of applying the no-break attribute didn't
    fit well into the workflow of importing external documents because around 10-20%
    of the spaces needed to be this type. The CE version of InDesign had changed the
    non-breaking space (u00A0) behavior for these languages.\r\nWhen converting an
    earlier document we replace u00A0 with u202F to preserve the original behavior."
