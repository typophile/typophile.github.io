body: "I am trying to identify this font for my boyfriend. He created this image quite
  a while back. He lost the font he used and he can't remember where he found it or
  what the name of the font is. I'm sorry for how tiny the image is. I hope the font
  can be identified. There are some dots in the middle of some of the letters and
  dots at the tail of the \"s\"....Help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/277083_175721849179368_404771231_n_3457.jpg]"
