  face for our magazine. Any help would be appreciated. I've attached a larger sample.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: A commercially available match may be impossible. GQ is known for commissioning
    proprietary type. Consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=4&displayfontid=ITC.10354.0.0&fontRendererText=Men+of+the+Year">ITC
    Bailey</a> (similar proporitions) or <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_torus.html">Torus</a>
    (angled stroke endings).

    body: 'You''re probably right. I''ve run into a wall before with them, but since
      their primary font is Titling Gothic FB (which was exclusive but is no longer),
      and the current issue uses Omnes in the feature section which isn''t proprietary
      I''m hoping this mystery font is not. Especially since I''ve not seen this font
      in GQ the past 3 issues. '

  body: It's certainly subjective, but I think Omnes is a much better face than the
    one you're seeking. Can you tell me what you like about it?

    body: "I like Omnes, but I work for a city magazine with a wide array of subject
      matter ranging from Top Doctor listings to Fashion to Real Estate to Restaurant
      listings to in-depth personal stories. I'm not confident in the fonts flexibility
      and range although I'm still considering it at this point.  \r\n\r\nI do like
      how Cubanica was used in GQ (THANK YOU MRSHWARTZ). I wanted to test it before
      deciding if it works for me, but I feel its closer to a classic gothic, but
      with unique features built to distinguish it. It also has a subltle retro feel.
      \r\n\r\nI plan to test a few san serifs in my evaluation. I'm testing Foundry
      Monoline and Titling Gothic FB in addition to Omnes and Cubanica.\r\n\r\nThanks
      for the help. "

    which Medina doesn't have? Or are you considering it for display purposes only?\r\n\r\nRegarding
    GQ, I'm impressed with how Fred Woodward & Co. manage to give the magazine a consistent
    voice while practically redesigning every issue."

      be limited to display without an italic option. \r\n\r\nFred did that frequently
      at Rolling Stone and made it work. The guy is good."

    We've had several inquiries about GQ already, and Googling "GQ" while restricting
    your search to "site:typophile.com" yields <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=site%3Atypophile.com+GQ&btnG=Search">these
    results</a>. Check the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/16337">November,

    and into the feature well of Entertainment Weekly. Bureau Grotesque still rules
    the departments, though.
