body: "Hi... what started out as a novice attempt to organize a publishing firm computer
  network and design assets (from art scraps to fonts), I have personally been intrigued
  by how difficult it is to accurately categorize the Sans-serifs. Various forums
  have pointed to the 'g' as a defining marker... but this seems to be not always
  the case... \r\n\r\nAs an example, the line between 'grotesk/grotesque' and 'neo-grotesk'
  seems blurry, specifically in modern designs of even historical typefaces (with
  optical kerning, etc.). So, here is how my first take on drawing the line between
  grotesk and neo grot (and between neo-grot and humanist, not included in this list).
  The Humanist and Geometric are also another kettle of fish. But is this correct,
  so far ?\r\n\r\nThanks...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrotesk\r\n\r\n[Berthold] Akzidenz Grotesk\t\t\r\n[OurType]
