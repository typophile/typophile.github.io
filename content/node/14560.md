body: "Would there be any interest in an online tool for collaborative font design
  of open source fonts?\r\n\r\nI have been trying for a while to work a way to combine
  my love of type design and passion for creating beautifully useful websites. After
  a drunken chat with a developer friend we have come up with a few ideas for a way
  of building a tool for fostering a community based font design collective that would
  release final products as Open Source fonts.\r\n\r\nBefore I go into how this might
  work how much interest would there be in such a tool?"

    I have an idea of how it might work but it is obviously based around the software
    that I use to build my fonts, and also the process is based on my methods too.\r\n\r\nThe
    way I see the process working is something like this;\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><strong>1.
    Direction</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>Discussion based starting point where the style
    and purpose of the font is set out. This will result in the basic brief and outline
    of the fonts specs.</dd>\r\n<dt><strong>2. Grid</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>From the
    initial discussion we should be able to design a grid which will form the template
    for all charecters.</dd>\r\n<dt><strong>3. Template characters</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>An
    initial group of characters would be created to set the tone and style of the
    font. </dd>\r\n<dt><strong>4. Character set</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>We now move into
    covering the full Character set. There will be a navigation page that has a whole
    for all full ASCII set,  each one will hold alternatives for each character for
    discussion, any of which can be downloaded, edited, and uploaded.</dd>\r\n<dt><strong>5.
    Creating the font</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>Once all the characters have been created
    a font can be created from the outlines by the font admin. This font can only
    be edited by one user at a time and must be signed out and in whenever anyone
    makes the change. OpenType is my preferred format.</dd>\r\n<dt><strong>6. Version
    tracking</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>The obvious advantage to this kind of development
    is that the font can evolve and improve endlessly. Missing characters can be added,
    languages covered. And issues dealt with</dd>\r\n\r\nHow does all that sound as
    start?"

  body: sounds pretty good, but you didn't answer the software question. i think that's
    a important piece of this puzzle. of course i'd prefer everything to be in FontLab's
    vfb format, but i understand that other developers use different tools. maybe
    it would be best to just save as [[OpenType]] [[Compact Font Format|CFF]] format
    or perhaps even in [[TrueType]] format?

    font) will help the designers fiscal status just as if they designed a free font.
    I can understand why some people dislike free fonts, as most, sadly, suck. But
    if someone decides he'd like to charge for a font just so it won't be free, that
    guy, imo, is a fucktard.

    To many type designers contributing to a \"free\" font just further erodes the
    perceived value users put in fonts. Contributing to a charity font does not do
    this - the publicity around such an effort increases the perceived value of fonts
    - a user may say \"I've never purchased a font before, but this is for a good
    cause\" - that customer will be more likely to come back in the future and pay
    for a commercial font.\r\n\r\nContrast the very low involvement in OSS fonts by
    professionals and the huge number of type designers who contributed to the FontAid
    projects. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    to see the type industry damaged in any way. Opening a project up to designers
    and technicians from different backgrounds and cultures in an open non profit
    way always results in something that is at the very least interesting and at best
    brilliant.\r\n\r\nThere are ways around ethical and quality issues with considered
    rules and guidance from a well informed steering group. There are also well developed
    legal presidents for similar projects that cover the designers, the project and
    the end user. For example <a href='http://creativecommons.org'>Creative Commons</a>
    offers a way to openly copyright work.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a central
    pot where the project can collect donations from people using fonts for profit.
    I do this on a regular basis when using open source products and always openly
    tell clients that part of their fee is going to the community that helped make
    the framework possible to develop their sites.\r\n\r\nI think the first step is
    probably to discuss how people would like to see this working and any ideas that
    you may have to make it live up to the potential i think it has. There is a lot
    of work to do to make something like this happen and would appreciate as much
    help as anyone can give :)"

    the cause in question. However my feeling is that there would have been considerably
    less professional participation if that had been the case.\r\n\r\nI don't think
    this is really a question of ethics - I don't think its unethical to make and
    distribute a free font. I think everyone has the right to create something and
    put it in the public domain if they so wish. My arguments were around attracting
    skilled participants. I could be wrong, I just feel that looking at unpaid OSS
    font efforts in the past they have not attracted professional participation.\r\n\r\nAnyway
    best of luck with the project. It certainly looks interesting and I hope it goes

  body: "What's the business model? Open source software is great, but it is generally
    based on something other than volunteerism, usually involving the possibility
    of making money from service contracts. So you make the software, give it away,
    and then get people to pay you to help them use it, customise it, support it,
    etc. This is the typical business model for open source development. The huge
    open source industry is not made possible by a bunch of well meaning programmers
    working for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe problem of a viable business model for open source
    fonts has been around for a while now, and no one has come up with a really good
    solution to it. This is why there are so few open source fonts. If you want the
    quality of professional font development, you generally need to figure out some
    way for professionals to make money."

    proposition.\r\n\r\nI am just interested in seeing the outcome of an open collaborative
    project. I guess if you wanted to build a business model for this you would probably
    have to create some kind of subscription based membership with a small enough
    payment to not put the majority of people off and may actually insure that only
    those who are truly committed will be involved. But this to me is missing the
    point, I don't want this to be exclusive in any way, I want people to be able
    to put forward ideas that may be a little left field, they can always be rejected,
    but that's how you get truly original work."

    been thinking about free fonts for a while, and have come to a slightly different
    conclusion than yours. I believe that many people miss that <em>learning</em>
    is one of the most powerful motivations to do free software development. There
    is no reason why this can't apply to fonts as well.\r\n\r\nIf one follows this
    theory, then the ingredients for a successful free font community include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mentoring
    by more skilled type people, particularly constructive critique.\r\n<li>A two-way
    communication with an appreciative user base. It's much more fun to meet a specific
    need than to draw yet another crappy font to be added to the zillions already
    available at dafont and related sites.\r\n<li>An attractive presentation of the
    results. Good organization, test settings, maybe even an interactive preview.
    Feature the \"good stuff\" prominently to avoid getting bogged down too much by
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law\">Sturgeon's Law</a>.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI
    personally don't think the choice of tools matters all that much. Hardcore free
    software folk (as well as starving students) will probably go for FontForge, while
    others will want to use commercial tools. I'm working on my own tools which I
    think will be especially useful for beginners, so I'd hate to see lock-in to particular
    tools.\r\n\r\nAs for the business / ethics / etc. issues, I'm still mulling all
    this over, which is one reason I haven't pushed harder on free fonts myself. I'm
    personally inclined to think that a body of extremely high quality free fonts
    is a net good for society, but I also respect arguments to the contrary.\r\n"

    license to individuals (but not  open source). I have no complaint at all against
    fonts being made freely available, so long as the people who make the fonts are
    adequately rewarded (usually with money, but not necessarily so). Type design
    is a profession, and people shouldn't be doing it for nothing: that just undermines
