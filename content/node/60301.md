  it out digitally --what digital Garamond most closely replicates MT Garamond?

  body: I suppose that your best bet in this case would likely be the digital [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=243183&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=9132&query=MONOTYPE%20GARAMOND&SCOPE=Fonts|Monotype
    Garamond]] from Monotype Imaging.

  body: "Do you mean you are going to eventually set the book in metal Monotype Garamond?
    But you want to lay it out in InDesign or Quark before you start setting? Is that
    right?\r\n\r\nIf so, then by all means, as Kent says, digital Monotype Garamond
    is your ONLY choice. They are the \"same\" face, and no other digital Garamond
    looks at all like this one.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to very carefully measure the height
    of the metal face, and then you'll probably need to make a series of very small
    adjustments to make the size of the digital face match the height of the metal.
    Keep in mind that letterfitting between the two versions will likely be different.
    So if your book is justified text, you won't likely get an accurate line-for-line
    layout once you start setting metal. & lord knows what you will find about the
    comparative widths of any particular letter in the two versions. If these have
    been altered very much in the digital version, this will further complicate how
    accurate your layout will be. Maybe you are doing poetry; then you'll be lucky
    and have an easier job.\r\n\r\nThe overall color of the digital Garamond, printed
    on your laser printer, will also be much different than metal prints on paper.\r\n\r\ngood
    luck / have fun\r\n\r\npowers"

    sizes, increasing it until the result is comparable with letterpress inking.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal
