  body: "Hi Russelim and Zara:\r\n\r\nActually I\u2019m not interested in applying
    for the position... I was just curious if the pay for a graphic designer was acceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, many of the state graphics are really ugly. They should have mandatory typography
    training!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m interested in another position for the State... but
    anyway.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
