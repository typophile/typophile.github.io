  above.\r\nThe bold one looks like Myriad but it's not...\r\nFor the light italic
  one , I have no clue. Is this nice \"k\" a german only character ?\r\nBy the way,
  i want to mention that this is from an amazing project from Field studio featuring
  a colorful generated font: http://www.field.io/project/dokfestlounge#/8\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AudioVisuelle_6674.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
  everyone for your amazing font skills !"
