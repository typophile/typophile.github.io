  can't help it, when I'm bored, I often go to this website and see what I can possibly
  try to convince my dad to buy me. I love the layout of the website because it's
  really easy to navigate and find exactly what your looking for.\r\n\r\nI also found
  this website: http://www.stumbleupon.com/toolbar/#search=design%2520websites&url=http%2525253A//www.robbianodesign.com/\r\nI
  came across this website on stumbleupon, and I thought it was pretty interesting
  when a bunch of pictures of motorcycles popped up considering I just took motorcycle
  classes over the weekend. I started looking at the website and I like the simplicity
  of it. I also like the graphics that it uses."
