  TARGET="_top">http://www.akiba.or.jp/index_e.html</A> <BR>which is the website of
  Tokyo&#39;s Akihabara district. <BR>This looks like a adaptation of Plantin. If
  you visit the inner pages the same font is used at smaller size for the headings,
  and there is looks more like some bastardization of Caslon.  <BR>Can anyone put
  a name to this font?'
