  article. Design projects can be from print, web, or other media. Script, text, and
  display typography - all are welcome. Big clients, little ones, or self-promotional
  - it''s all good to me. Work can be already published or in process. Please email
  examples and a brief description of your project to: tamye {a} typelife.com. Looking
  forward to seeing what you''ve been working on.'

    We can talk about what you've got going on and if it will be ready for eyes in
    time for this piece. Anything you can show/describe at this point would be helpful,
    David.
