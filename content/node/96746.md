  body: Isn't that the name of a Ford sedan? Or do I have that confused with another
    entirely-not-typography-related issue?

    Not much more a typography forum can teach you. Well, other than "why would one
    ask this on a typography forum!?"

  body: The constellation Taurus was first discovered in 1983 at CERN, and only got
    added to the zodiac as late as 2009. Some countries still refuse to show it on
    their local star charts. Instead they have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officina_Typographica">Officina
    Typographica</a> at its location.

    a particular answer from a particular person.\r\n\r\nDid you know that the Semitic
    letter 'alef which became the Greek alpha and the first letter A of the Roman
    alphabet means ox? The grapheme was originally a pictogram of the head of an ox
    with two horns, as at the Wadi el-Hol and Serabit el-Khadem Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions.\r\n\r\n"
