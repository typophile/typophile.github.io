  I thought Figgins?... Figgins probably never produced a lowercase sans, let alone
  a true italic a in sans. Very smart and a very successful super family. The whole
  Modern Suite that Shinn developped amazes me. I borrowed from my teacher a type
  specimen that Shinntype published I put some pictures on flickr\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/six_7_8/3454503676/]]"
