  body: "The closest fonts I could come up with were [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/justanotherfoundry/mashine/|Mashine]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/45-degrees/|45 Degrees]]. My next suggestion
    would be to search the Techno category of freebies at www.dafont.com. A lot of
    Techno styles I've seen have come from there. (I'll stay off my soapbox about
    Techno-mania, but can't resist saying minimalist design deserves similar pricing.)\r\n\r\n-
