  body: I like what you have here so far, but I'm not sure those numerals really harmonize
    with your letterforms. I do enjoy the bit of uncial shown here - it's a nice contrast
    to the staid stressed-sans. I like that the soft joins remind me of an eye exam
    :)

  body: Nice idea! I think the {h} is too jarring, though. Maybe give it a descender
    instead? The {s} is top-heavy.
