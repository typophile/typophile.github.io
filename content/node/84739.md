  body: "I disagree with TNR as the type. For starters the J and Q are wrong, and
    the letter spacing is odd, more like a typewriter (monospaced) font. The justified
    type throws the spacing out of line, I think, or these letters might all line
    up vertically.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I have not figured out what it is yet.  I
    am just sure it isn't Times New Roman.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
