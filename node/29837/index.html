		<div class="commentbody"><p>Why do you use more than one question mark at the end of sentences?</p>
<p>Seriously though, a thought leader is someone doesn&rsquo;t need or want everything spelled out for them. Someone who can lead our clients through strategic innovation. Someone our clients trust and rely on for guidance.</p>
<p>As for the essay, we didn&rsquo;t feel like a word count was necessary.</p>
<p>There are two ways of answering the &ldquo;best small companies&rdquo; question The quantitative answer can be found here:</p>

<p>For me though, it is something more emotional. I love what I do. I love who I work with.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck to you as well.</p>
