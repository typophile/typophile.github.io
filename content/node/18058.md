  IDing the logotype for Victoria's Secret. I usually go to www.brandsoftheworld.com
  for the logo eps files. But VS isn't listed on that site. My friends thought VS
  logotype is in Trajan but it's not. If anyone can shed light on this, I'd appreciate
  your help!\r\n\r\nAlso, by any chance, does anyone know the typeface used for Banana
  Republic's logotype?\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!"

    body: "Tim, thanks for the match! You rock! It's very close or might just be it.
      Does anyone have the font, FS Rome though, or could someone be kind enough to
      type out Victoria's Secret and outline the type in Illustrator to send to me?
      I'll fix the kerning myself. I just need the logo for some spec campaign for
      my book. Thanks much!\r\n\r\nAnd thanks again, everyone, for helping a new member
      out :>"
