body: "I am about to update all of our food labels to the new 2018 fda guidelines.
  But these new rules are making it a bit more difficult to fit the nutrition facts
  into the space available. FDA only specifies the use of Helvetica black and regular.
  \ Does anyone know if it is okay to use a condensed version of Helvetica? I thought
  everything was fitting until I got down to the Vitamin info, which requires a fairly
  wide space, even with abbreviations.\r\nFDA hasn't responded to my questions, so
  I am asking here to see if anyone has any insight.\r\n\r\nThe size of the nutrition
  fact area, right now, is 1.75 x 2.75.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAbbie"

  body: Looks amazing to me that FDA has rules about the font to used for Nutrition
    Facts. Is there rules about the size of the type? If not can you only reduce the
    size to fit your width of your label. On my side, I used condensed typeface when
    I work on this kind of info.

  body: No wonder food info labels on the US goods we get look so unappealing. Faceless
    mook look. Accept no substitutes.

    but if I understood what is said correctly, their use of Helvetica Regular/Black
    is informative, not normative. Hennyways, this one hopes they do know not to exceed
    the RDA of Helvetica."
