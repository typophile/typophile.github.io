body: "Hey all, I've got a project to design the brochure, poster and website for
  a conference on the future of the internet.\r\n\r\nI want to avoid the often sickening
  'design gimmicks' usually associated with web design (drop shadows, plastic, web
  2.0!) and have a design that is both attractive, relevant and simple.\r\n\r\nI am
  toying with the idea of posing the limitation of using only 256 web-safe colours
  in my design, which will likely be mostly vector shapes.  Any input on colour palette?\r\n\r\nI
  am also thinking about using a monospaced typeface for certain parts of the hierarchy.
  \ Is this design suicide?  Is this relevant to the subject matter?\r\n\r\nShould
  I be trying to find a fresh monospaced font and pairing it with a nice typeface,
  or should I be looking into web-safe fonts that have less depth, but families like
  Lucida have both a sans and a monospaced face in the same family.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  or critiques would be great, I'll post the actual work up here for critique once
  I get rolling on it, thanks in advance for your insight and suggestions!"

    it's not directly related, but not that you can't go that route. I don't think
    it'd conflict."
