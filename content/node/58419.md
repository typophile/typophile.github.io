    OTF can also encapsulate all the data from a Type 1 font, so a conversion can
    be lossless. Whether this is actually the case depends on the tool you're using
    for the conversion."

    I made two .vfb files for my font. I did Type 1 hinting on one of them and on
    the other I did TT hinting.\r\nFrom the one I TT hinted, I generated a .ttf font.
    I also want to generate an .otf font (with OT logo). Now my question is: which
    .vfb file should I use to make an (\"official\") .otf font, the one that has been
    Type 1 hinted or the one that has been TT hinted?\r\n\r\n\r\nRudy"

  body: "For the end user the distinction between OT/TTF and OT/CFF (PS Outlines)
    matters with regard of outline quality and screen display.\r\n\r\nUnneccessary
    outline conversions should be avoided, otherwise the outline quality may suffer.
    That means, if you already have TT outlines with TT hints, use \"Generate fonts
    -> TrueType/OpenType TT\" in FL Studio (and check that you want to include OT
    features and kerning as an OT feature).\r\n\r\nIf you have PS outlines, the easiest
    would be to generate the format \"OpenType PS\" from FL Studio. If you generate
    \"TrueType/OpenType TT\" from PS outlines, an automatic conversion to TT outlines
    and TT hint will take place. It's better to convert manually and then make adjustments
    before generating.\r\n\r\nIf the fonts will be used on Windows, TT outlines may
    have a better screen quality, but more manual hinting corrections are needed for
    that."

    sum it up, use:\r\n- a font with TT hints to make an OT/TTF format, and\r\n- a

  body: "Rudy, \r\n\r\nthat is the right summary. \r\n\r\nOne more thing to add is
    that: \r\n\r\n<strong>OpenType PS fonts</strong>, i.e. PostScript-flavored OpenType
    fonts, also known as OpenType CFF fonts (made out of Type 1-hinted PostScript-curve-based
    VFBs) <strong>must carry the .otf file extension.</strong> They always get a green
    \"O\" OpenType icon in Windows. They always are labeled \"OpenType font\" by Mac
    OS X. \r\n\r\n<strong>OpenType TT fonts</strong>, i.e. TrueType-flavored OpenType
    fonts (made out of TT-hinted TrueType-curve-based VFBs) <strong>can have either
    the .ttf file extension or the .otf file extension.</strong> \r\n\r\nIf OpenType
    TT fonts have the .otf file extension, they always get a green \"O\" OpenType
    icon in Windows, and they always are labeled \"OpenType font\" by Mac OS X. \r\n\r\nIf
    OpenType TT fonts have the .ttf file extension, then on Mac OS X they will always
    be labeled \"Windows TrueType font\". On Windows, they will get the green \"O\"
    OpenType icon only if the font has a digital signature (DSIG, which you can add
    in FontLab Studio, but you must purchase an Authenticode code signing Class 3
    Standard certificate*). If the font doesn't have a digital signature, it will
    be shown with a blue \"TT\" TrueType icon on Windows. \r\n\r\nWhether an OpenType
    TT font has a blue \"TT\" or green \"O\" icon on Windows, and whether it is called
    \"OpenType font\" or \"Windows TrueType font\" on Mac OS X, has <strong>nothing</strong>
    to do with its functionality. It will rasterize the same way, the OpenType Layout
    features will work the same way. The only difference is the label that appears
    in Finder, and the icon the font gets in Windows. \r\n\r\nThis is something that
    you need to explain to your customers if you make OpenType TT fonts. If you don't
    want to explain it to the customers, then always use the .otf file extension or
    put a digital signature into your fonts. \r\n\r\nBTW, putting a digital signature
    into your fonts is <strong>advisable for both OpenType PS and OpenType TT fonts</strong>.
    A digital signature certifies that the font has been created by a certain foundry,
    and it cannot be forged. So if someone modifies your font, the digital signature
    will be removed, or will become invalid, or the person who modified the font will
    have to sign it with their own digital signature (for which they will need to
    buy their own digital certificate under their own name). Digital signatures won't
    help you to protect your fonts from being pirated, but at least they are a proof
    that a certain font is original. \r\n\r\n*) The <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_digital_sig_guide.html\">Adobe
    guide to OpenType font signing</a> is helpful, but note that you only need to
    complete step 1 described there. The rest is done automatically in FontLab Studio
    if you install your certificate in FontLab Studio's preferences. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    can be a good addition in protecting your font. It is costly though, $499 for
    1 font, for only 1 year... with the family I'm working on now this will cost me
    a minimum of $8000 and then I haven't earned anything yet :P \r\nAny chance they

  body: "Rudy, \r\n\r\none clarification: the digital certificate is for one year,
    but you can sign as many fonts as you want with it. That means: one certificate,
    many signatures. So the cost is $499 per year, no matter how many fonts you produce.
    I agree that this still is costly. \r\n\r\nA more affordable option is to create
    a \"self-signed certificate\" -- which can be done <strong>for free</strong>.
    You will be able to digitally sign your fonts although to the users, the signer
    will appear as \"untrusted\". But well, the contents of the digital signatures
    in fonts isn't really actually checked by any software at this time, Windows only
    check for their presence. \r\n\r\nPlease check the Microsoft <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140234(office.10).aspx\">Digital
    Code Signing Step-by-Step Guide</a> document. \r\n\r\nYou only need to complete
    steps 1-3 (Download the code signing executables needed to digitally sign code
    files, Create a test certificate, Create a Software Publishing Certificate (SPC)
    file). And you will need to use a Windows machine to do that (or the free <a href=\"http://www.dosbox.com/\">DOSbox</a>
    emulator on Mac OS X -- which is actually quite cool). Once you have the private
    key file and the .spc certificate file that you produce in this process, you can
    link these files to the Digital signatures section of FontLab Studio\u2019s Preferences/Options
    dialog box.\r\n\r\nBTW, I just realized that I already answered this on Typophile,
    but it was three years ago: \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29770\r\n\r\nYou can
    check that discussion for more information. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
