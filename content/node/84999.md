  hoping that the iPad at least might come with a Light variant of Helvetica. It currently
  renders Helvetica Regular quite heavily and OSX has shipped with Helvetica Light
  (in addition to Neue Light and Ultralight) for a few years now.\r\n\r\nAnybody able
  to check this out?"

    a tablet based computing device that allows end users to license and install their
    own fonts on it. Clearly a missed opportunity for Apple. ;-)"

    Nothing mind-blowing, but it does get a few workhorses like Helvetica Light, Helvetica
    Neue Light & Ultralight, Gill Sans Light... and Papyrus\r\n\r\nhttp://iosfonts.com/"
