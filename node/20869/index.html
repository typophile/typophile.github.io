  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Recently graduating, I absolutely had to have business cards to hand out, and I noticed this unfortunate mistake. I double-checked my digital file, and it is not reflected there, nor did I encounter it in my proofs. I have no idea what happened, and this really is one of the first times I have had this type of issue in all my printing experience. Being affiliated with commercial print shops and presses for the past three years, employed in two different pre-press departments. this is one of the worst shifts or mistakes I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Notice how far away the &ldquo;@&rdquo; is away from the email address. How BAD is this REALLY. Some argue that its like a natural stop before the server info, I say its a typographical nightmare. I have 1000 of these puppies, and I just can&rsquo;t seem to to get over this. Maybe the sagely advice of some other typophiles will calm my nerves.</p>

<p>If you do reprint, how about losing the dash between the bracketed area code and the first three numbers in your telephone number? (602) 738-</p>
<p>Just a suggestion. : )</p>

<p>We just sent back a 5,000 print run of cards for a client because the UV coating smudged the color on the back side of 1/5 of the cards. It&rsquo;s your right to be picky when your work/card represents you and your quality.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>With respect to your original design intentions, in all honesty I think it looks great with the space before the @.</p>
<p>Think about the psychology of a user reading your card:</p>
<p>1.
user thinks: &ldquo;right, what is the first user part of the e-mail address?&rdquo;
&mdash;card facilitates legibility of this, by appropriately and easily indentifying and emphasising mdg2184 (which is a mouthful)&ndash;</p>
<p>2.
user thinks: &ldquo;right got it, what is the end part after the @ symbol?&rdquo;
&ndash;card facilitates legibiligy of @, with the extra preceeding space&ndash;</p>
<p>The e-mail address still looks like the same chunk of information, thanks to the bracket of your area code.</p>
<p>Again with respect, I think all designers are guilty of getting caught up in TOO much detail, at times unnecessarily. You sound pretty tense, and I think it&rsquo;s best to accept it and look at the bright side this time.</p>

<p>Depends on your view of a worth-it client, if one had the eye to spot it, would they accept the explanation or would they expect their suppliers to have quality stationery?

<p>You got the proof for a reason.  If you accepted the proof, then you should pay at least half the cost of the reprinting, if not all of it.</p>
<p>Double-punctuating the area bothers me more, though.  Use either a hyphen or parentheses, not both.  Punctuating the address may be a good idea also, but a less serious error.</p>
<p>Discerning clients assume your business card represents your best work.  Why hand them reasons to not to hire you?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To answer that, I have to say that:</p>
<p>A) I received way more prints than I was supposed to. I ordered 500, paid for 500, but actually got 1000+. This isn&rsquo;t a reason to not have them reprinted, but, I really do hate wasting. Recycling is great, but in the end, if you do a little research, the amount of resources it actually takes to run the recycling plants barely breaks even with the recycled product that is produced.</p>
<p>B) It was a friend that printed them, and even though are relationship is good, people don&rsquo;t always take criticism well, and often times may not offer to do favors and such for you in the future. This job was small, and certainly was not a &ldquo;favor&rdquo;, but, in the end I still appreciate it more.</p>
<p>C) Sometimes, we all get caught up in our own designs, and nitpick them beyond belief. I asked many people before coming here about what they thought of this dilemma. This thread proves that &ldquo;good things do come from bad things&rdquo; as Andi had a great idea. That is exactly why I posted this thread.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you doubt or have questions about my credentials in terms of my &ldquo;experience&rdquo;, i would be happy to provide you a copy of my résumé.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Building on Andi&rsquo;s suggestion (which I fear may overwhelm a small business card) I once got a beautiful resume from a design student who had printed in non-repro blue the grid lines and some explanatory text for the various elements on his resume (A-heads, flush left rag right, x-height, etc). The whole thing was done in a very elegant understated manner - it looked good, was informative and showed off his knowledge.</div>

<p>Your ecomomic justification for not recycling is a cop-out: recycling, at least in part, reduces the number of trees that are logged to produce paper. Since trees are the largest consumers of the carbon dioxide that industrualized societies are producing in ever-larger quantities, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that we can do to reduce demand makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>Recycle the cards: the lack of separation between the street address and city and the use of parentheses <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a hyphen in the telephone number are mistakes which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted --> made. As they say, &ldquo;You never get a second chance to make a first impression.&rdquo;</p>
