  is designing a Buck Rogers in the 25th Century book. In the show, they use this
  type a lot in the background. This is the clearest picture I could get of it. Is
  this a specific typeface? Or can someone point me towards something similar? My
  boss wants me to find 'THE' Buck Rogers typeface.\r\n\r\nThank you!!!!!!!!"
