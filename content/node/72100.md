    perspective, Slovak is far and away the most demanding on spacing/kerning, due
    to d-caron, l-caron, and t-caron and i-acute.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Hungarian
    is not that demanding, because the hungarumlaut is \"acute\", so may be kerned
    the same as the plain letter when following T, V, W and Y."

    wonder if perhaps this comment reflects a misunderstanding? The standard writing

    Japanese, and Chinese) has a standard writing system that is non-Latin, so their
    romanized forms are less widely used.\r\n\r\nThough, that being said, the demand
    for the diacritic forms needed for transliteration of Chinese will only be rising,
    and not all of them are available in common character sets.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    after you message in the [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|topic about the font
    I'm developing]], I did some research about languages which use Latin alphabet.
    Although Celeste's original question seems to be about European languages, this
    info may be useful.\r\n\r\nThese are the ones with more diacritics, besides Vietnamese,
    Tlingit and Slovak:\r\n\r\n<em>Apache</em> uses 16 characters with diacritics,
    plus the glottal stop mark (').\r\n\r\n<em>Sami</em> uses 17 if you sum up all
    the language variations.\r\n\r\n<em>Navajo</em> uses 18 and also glottal stop
    mark.\r\n\r\n<em>Twi</em> seems to use 18 too, but the info I found is not complete.\r\n\r\n<em>Kolkata</em>
    is not a language but a transliteration scheme for Indic languages (actually the
    most widely adopted scheme). It uses 20.\r\n"

    if we did not have these protrusions into the x-height :-)  Add to that all of
    the i diacritics which don't have enough horizontal space to prevent overlap of
    neighboring diacritics and you have a \"crash course\" in diacritical abutment

    in common character sets.\"\r\n\r\nThere are only 4 tones to all chinese characters.
    \u0101, \xE1, \u01CE and a`. It's quite simple to design but you are right that
    most common characters set don't have them. \r\n\r\nThese 3 - \"\u0101, \xE1,
    \u01CE\" I cut and paste from wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese.
    i wonder what font they use.) but I can't find \"a`\" on my keyboard, so I basically
    type a combination of \"a\" and \" ` \" with poor kerning.\r\n\r\nFYI, no one
    read the chinese language in its romanized version. All publications are written
    in original Chinese alphabets. It's not just \"less widely used\". It is wrong
    to be used. To typeset an article in romanized version is almost like a sin to
    the Chinese language and you don't write Chinese in romanized version at all.
    The romanized version is only for the purpose of pronunciation, designed as a
    simplified version to replace the original \"Han Yi Pinyi\" system, which uses
    it's own unique set of alphabets and is very complicated. It's almost like a language
    by itself and I don't think it's qualified to be called diacritics at all.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20090805113925-1747318300_6453.jpg]"

  body: "Contrary to the Chinese language, the Malay Language, (Bahasa Malaysia) which
    is the official language of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia (In Indonesia is
    called Bahasa Indonesia) is entirely written in romanized version. \r\n\r\nThe
    entire set of the English alphabet A-Z are sufficient to form all Malay words
    including it's phonatary function, so no diacritic is needed. The original Malay
    language was in \"Jawi\", a combination of arabic and Persian scripts, with additional
    letters added as an adaptation to local phonetics. Under the influence of Dutch
    and British, the language was romanized started from 17th century and today all
    official documents, publications and school text books uses the romanized version
    of the Malay language. Very few people can read the original Jawi, except in the
    context of Islamic literature. The original Jawi is thus facing the danger of
    extinction today. Most students in Malaysia today don't even know that the original
    language of Malay is in Jawi. It's not even being taught in the school at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
