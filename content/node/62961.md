  outward facing front feet on letters like lower-case n's and m's this was Palatino...but
  the lowercase y is totally different. Eek! Help? Maybe it is really obvious, and
  I'm just being thick...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_3882.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank

  body: "Palatino's designer is Hermann Zapf, and he designed a few similar fonts,
    like Aldus, and Zapf Rennaissance (I think Sistina and Michelangelo are all caps).
    I don't think this is one of those, but I haven't looked yet to confirm that.
    What I suspect is that someone 'customized' Palatino by borrowing a 'y' from another
    font to change the look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Huh. Crazy. That could be possible. The y is really distinct (to me - I'm
    no expert). Have you seen it before? Now that I'm looking at it, the brackets
    on the v are different, too. Maybe it is another Zaph font, as you suggest. That
    S is so crazy (the lower counter, if that is the right term...)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I looked at the other Zapf fonts, and I don't think that 'y' is from any
    of them. The rest of your sample looks like Palatino, although my review of that
    was only quick.\r\n\r\nSometimes when a supplier want to offer an alternative
    version (to use a euphemism for copying a design), they will create a 'new' font
    by changing a couple of letters, so it's not a complete copy. Old time metal type
    foundries did the same thing all the time. Mergenthaler Linotype, American Type
    Founders (ATF) and Monotype were constantly copying each other (or other foundries)
    so they could offer a similar style to their own customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: The lowercase w is not Palatino either, but I'd agree apart from these three
    odd letters the rest looks very much like Palatino.

    1951.\r\n\r\n\"...they will create a \u2019new\u2019 font by changing a couple

    I had no idea! "

  body: "It seems this is the original version of Palatino. There was also a modified
    version released in the 1950s. According to Zapf in his book \"About Alphabets\":
    \r\n\r\n<cite>The somewhat calligraphically-stressed letters E F S q p s v w and
    y in the Palatino roman were given more traditional forms for the British and
    American markets....</cite>\r\n\r\nI think the modified Palatino is the version
    one usually sees and the only one that has been digitized."
