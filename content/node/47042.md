body: "Hey, i am brand new to this website and this forum. So please be nice! \r\nI
  started a clothing company around 18 months ago. But i have had many comments saying
  its not clear to read the typeface and that the 'r' looks like 2 letters instead
  of one. So i have decided to totally re-design it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is i forked
  out for photoshop cs3 extended about 8 weeks but to be honest don't have a clue
  where to start really.\r\n\r\ni know that my old logo looked a bit childish i want
  the new one to look more professional.\r\n\r\ni really like the font gill sans mt
  condensed and was wondering if you bright sparks could give me some good alternatives.\r\n\r\nalso
  if you good give me some ideas on layout and things like that, it would be very
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nbelow i have put and example of the past logo.\r\n\r\nhttp://i29.tinypic.com/2lx8il4.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nplease
  ANY help is very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nthe color scheme i want to be very neutral\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "For starters, I'd suggest using vector-based software (ie Illustrator) to
    design your logo\u2014or at least to produce it. If you're logo is vector you'll
    have no issues separating it for film (for silkscreening) or blowing it up to
    go on a billboard.\r\n\r\nAs for your old logo, I think the childish look has
    a lot to do with the bubbly letters, and the primary colours. Go ahead and use
    Gill Condensed and some neutral colours and you're already miles ahead of your
    old logo. \r\n\r\nOf course these are very basic suggestions... you should really
    consider who you're trying to appeal to and go from there.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nEric"

  body: "It feels like these are lacking an idea behind them. Why is the I all contorted?
    It seems like you've done it just because you can.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you forget
    about the computer for a bit and try drawing some ideas? The computer can too
    easily dictate what you make. And like Eric said, the primary colours don't look
    good.\r\n\r\nKeep on it, you'll come up with something!\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

    be easier for you to get your ideas out and let someone else who has technical

  body: "You should see more and more logos and don't forget a thing, if you think
    the font is beautiful, don't change it much!\r\ni think that that I would be better
    to be less distorted.\r\n\r\nSomething i try to do when i do a logo is to write
    on a paper everything remember about the brand so i can get its \"personality\"
    its \"style\". Then it's drawing around that.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound

  body: What type of clothing company do you have? Maybe do a tattoo inspired "in
    my" in a banner over a heart, Ed Hardy like. If it's more of a "cute" or "stylish"
    type clothing company, look to a more feminine look than you have designed. Check
    Veer for fonts like Affair or Loving Acts.
