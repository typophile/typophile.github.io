    it's based on Polonaise. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThe font reminded of Porcelain by Misprinted
    Type - Eduardo Recife and Ink In The Meat by Billy Argel, so I looked at their
    fonts.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ginja_4710.jpg]\r\n\r\nBTW, no numbers
    or punctuation in most free Billy Argel fonts."

  body: "Is a derivative work \"outline theft\"? As of this post, Ginga has been downloaded
    \ 1,556,558 times. That doesn't prove or connote anything. But would any of those
    have substituted Ginga for Polonaise? I don't think so. This is not the same (IMHO)
    as piracy or outright theft.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and make the argument that Billy
    Argel should have paid royalties or a licensing fee. Or is that the subject of
    another thread?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>would any of those have substituted Ginga for Polonaise?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's
    a very strong argument - in fact one I've used before myself. And to me pragmatism
    is more often than not a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nBut the bottom line is that
    secretly profiting (which doesn't have to be monetary) from somebody else's work
    is simply not OK. At the very least you have to give credit; maybe even get an
    OK from the original designer, if possible. Whether you stand on the shoulders
    of dead or living people, admit it and be prepared to share the windfall. It's
    not about submission, it's about being fair. For example if the original designer
    is an unreasonable nut-job, to hell with him.\r\n\r\nConsider the \"moral erosion\"
    this sort of thing does to the craft - in the long term affecting users too. Behavior
    is contagious! Let's behave well.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I always told people that I based myself on Oklahoma (a free font) to create this
    one. Every designer has influences. This font is just a revised version of his
    font. BTW, writing that I am an ass as a comment makes you look really smart,
