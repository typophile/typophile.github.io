  a phone book listing. I'd greatly appreciate any information that could help me
  regarding legibility at small sizes and a selection of potential fonts.\r\n\r\nWe
  are using Bell Centennial right now, but might well decide to change.\r\nWhitney,
  Martin Majoor's Janszen, ... suggestions will be most appreciated!"

  body: I'd think a slightly condensed sans would be clearer, a la Univers or Franklin
    Gothic. I'd think serifs would be harder to read at phone-book sizes.

  body: I read about H&FJ's Retina being suitable for this type of situation. But
    it's probably exclusive to some organization since I can't seem to find it on
    their site. Have you looked at the <a href="http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightmicro.php">Freight
    Micro family</a>?

  body: Bell Centennial is still a great font - even works as funky display face -
    love those ink traps.
