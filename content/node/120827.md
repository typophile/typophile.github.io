    could start with something like Agenda Condensed Black, convert it to outlines,
    and tweak the bezier curves on the Ds and T:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/agenda/\r\n\r\nStumpy
    Black might also make a good starting point:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/stumpy/"

    really close to the letterforms. Convert the straight strokes to curves, add mid
    points, and shift the corners inward to produce the effect of thickening towards
    the middle, and the logo appears, complete with smiling counters :)\r\nHere is
    _T_ with the original shown in red and the transformed letter in black [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AgendaCondBlack_T_Transformed_5755.jpg]\r\nSame
    process for _D_.\r\nDon"
