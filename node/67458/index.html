I would imagine it to be very helpful in designing fonts. I&rsquo;ve found some advice in the web, but the information seems to be somewhat scattered to concerning only diacritics for example. If I&rsquo;m creating a language support into a font, I&rsquo;d like to know exactly what glyphs I need to design for that language.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, that’s about it. Actually, most fonts out there only manage Basic Latin and Latin-1. It seems that people get bored after designing just about that many glyphs, and then they move on to some other font.</p>
<p>Latin Extended A gets supported for fonts that say they can handle “Central European”, i.e. Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and a bunch of other European national languages. Anything beyond that is quite rare. I’ve seen some fonts where only <em>parts</em> of Latin Extended A are supported, because the designer only cares about Czech and Polish but not Maltese or Romanian, for example. That’s kind of annoying, but it’s the designer’s decision in the end, I suppose.</p>
<p>The worst offenders are fonts where the designer has made a token attempt at adding things but doesn’t actually test them. An example is the Combining Diacritical Marks block, where sometimes a font includes most or all of the diacritics but the designer doesn’t bother to add composed glyphs or instead properly use the mark feature. Then it looks at first glance like the font could support many more characters in composition, but it actually doesn’t because the diacritics don’t work as God and the Unicode committee intended.</p>
<p>Some fonts have a small subset of the Combining Diacritical Marks, only the ones used in Western European languages, and then they don’t work except for the precomposed characters in Latin-1 and Latin Extended A. This is generally because designers will use the CDM block as a sort of scrap space, storing the diacritics for use in designing the Latin-1 &amp; LEA characters, and never considering that the presence of things in the CDM block implies functionality beyond those two ranges of precomposed glyphs. This behaviour is extremely common: try adding an acute accent to a lowercase n in your favorite fonts some day.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m off on an irrelevant rant. But I do have an important point to make. IMNSHO if you’re going to add a character you should endeavour to support it fully, and not just have it in there as a useless stub. In the case of fonts, nothing is better than broken and misleading.</p>

<p>I find this comment to be a bit peculiar. No font can realistically be expected to support <em> all </em> latin-based languages; each designer must therefore make decisions regarding which languages they will choose to support. What&rsquo;s odd about the above is that it suggests that those decisions should somehow revolve around the rather arbitrary grouping of languages into unicode blocks. Why is this more sensible than using geographical (e.g. Central European vs. Balkan/Mediterranean) or phylogenetic (e.g. Slavic vs. Romance/Semitic) criteria?</p>
<p>I admit to being guilty of this view myself, insofar as I tend to add support for Esperanto just to fill out the Latin Extended A block despite the fact that this language ranks <em> very </em> low on my list of languages I&rsquo;d want to support. On reflection, though, this really doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think anything available to the public came out of the project. Shame, really, because it would have been a nice resource had the project been continued.</p>
<p><em>For example, you would find à and é in German but I tried to include only those characters that are &ldquo;native&rdquo; to that language.</em></p>
<p>To be thorough, it would be useful to indicate which characters are marginal to a language. You would also find à and é in English, although they are not considered native letters. The same for å, š, and ž in Finnish, except that å does appear in the Finnish alphabet (which also includes a number of other letters not used for native Finnish words).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really complicated when you go through all these details. This is why it is useful to group several languages together and define the character set that will be sufficient for each of those languages. Hence the Western European, Central European and Baltic, etc. With something like African languages which are numerous and poorly documented, this is really the only possible approach; rather than trying to find out which characters are needed for each of hundreds of languages used in West Africa, it is more efficient to draw up a list of characters needed for several major West African languages. This is because regional and cultural groupings of languages tend to share characteristic letters.</p>
<p>The original poster talked about glyphs. Technically there is a difference between a glyph and a character, in that glyph refers to a particular shape of a character. The distinction is rather important because Unicode considers some similar characters used in different languages but with slightly different forms in each to be the same character. Depending on the language, uppercase Eng (Ŋ) will either resemble &ldquo;N&rdquo; with a hook or an enlarged &ldquo;n&rdquo; with a hook that may or may not descend, but in Unicode all these glyphs are variants of the same character. So really, you do need to know which languages you intend to support, because that may determine how you draw the glyphs.</p>

<p>The å is part of the Finnish alphabet, regardless of the fact that it is not used for any native Finnish words. So are letters like c, q, w, x, and z, which don&rsquo;t occur in native Finnish words either. Yes, the fact that Finland is a bilingual country probably has a lot to do with why the Finnish alphabet includes letters not really used in the language. But I stated nothing controversial.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true for a lot of foundries that produce OpenType text faces.
I have been putting, for instance, Esperanto characters (not to mention Greenlandic small k) in all my &ldquo;Extended Latin&rdquo; OpenType fonts (all styles and weights) for several years now, out of a sense of professional duty, although it makes absolutely no economic or practical sense.</p>

<p>Why not –?</p>
<p>Of course, not every font can be expected to cover everything. So, the choice to make is really a severe issue. However, as Nick Shinn puts it, it is a matter of “sense of professional duty” to provide at least a set of <em>some</em> decent comprehensiveness. A set on which to decide is still left to every font provider, to be based on his own considerations.
Unfortunately neither UC ranges nor the so-called codepages give reliable reference to that decision, so it remains – up to you.</p>

At first, it is intriguing and you feel compelled to be fair to everybody in the World and get a good sense of fair play erasing the boundaries of nationalism. Then you get interupted by the sound of your head hitting the keyboard as you drift off to sleep in the midst of your Ajurbajany.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Since there are fonts which support Chinese, and fonts which support the entire Basic Multilingual Page of Unicode, the idea that a font - not every font, but a font specifically designed to have a broad range of support - might support &ldquo;all&rdquo; latin-based scripts does not, at first glance, seem impossible.</p>
<p>But as we see in this thread, even that humble &ldquo;all&rdquo; requires research and is fuzzy around the edges. The African and Native American languages with such scripts are often quite obscure. And it&rsquo;s not impossible that new scripts of this type are still being developed.</p>
<p>Latin-based transliteration schemes for Arabic and ancient Egyptian, for example, I suppose might also be noted. The American Library Association had a modified version of ASCII which included the combining diacritics required for printing library cards for books from just about anywhere - but that would be just a start compared to the goal here.</p>
