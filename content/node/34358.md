body: I'm looking for a serif font for our magazine that has a modern tone but I find
  Farnham Text a little heavy for our entertainment mag's editorial tone. I like Freight
  Text a lot and am leaning towards it but I would really like to have a swash alternate
  as an option. Anyone know of something similar with an SC and swash versions? If
  not, I might try and sneak a Farnham swash cap into Freight and see if it works.
  I don't know if they are the same weight though.

  body: Well, <a href=http://typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/index.html>Mercury</a>
    is based on the same model as Farnham (and I've combined them to a pleasing effect
    in my eyes). It has small caps but no swashes. I don't know if you'd consider
    it less serious than Farnham (I might say it's more), but I thought I'd throw
    it out there. Combining Farnham swashes with Mercury would probably work better
    than most such combinations.

  body: "Mercury is really nice \u2013 sorry, it wasn't the tone of Farnham that was
    a problem, it was just too heavy at the regular face. I need something between
    a light and a regular, which is why Freight is good. But Mercury looks perfect
    if it can work with Farnham's swashes.\r\n\r\nand Leitura is nice but the thin
    Bodoni-esque parts are a little too fancy for this mag. Ditto for Luxury"

  body: Glad I ventured a suggestion, then. Although you probably noticed it, I wanted
    to make sure you saw that Mercury comes in both text and display versions (as
    does Farnham). I've only had experience with the text version; in my newspaper
    I use Farnham Display at large sizes where its strong serifs and inktraps come
    into play and Mercury Text for body copy. I've only gotten positive feedback on
    both.

  body: Yes, it does; Hoefler and Frere-Jones just don't put them on their character
    maps. In my use, the only thing it lacks is oldstyle figures, which I happen to
    prefer -- but H&FJ made it that way on purpose. They may be right, that readers
    are more comfortable with near-lining figures, but I still like that oldstyle
    feel. Farnham has both (and typographer's quotes too).
