body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nHas anybody else out there ever been paid font royalties from
  Fontworks (www.type.co.uk)? I am finding them diabolically difficult to communicate
  with and, despite me having been with them for a year, am yet to receive any royalty
  payments.\r\n\r\nJust wondering what the experiences of others has been...\r\n\r\nATF"

  body: They send me royalty reports quarterly. I invoice them and they pay promptly.
    Other than that I haven't communicated with them.

  body: "Are you actually due any royalties? ie. have they sold any of your stuff?\r\n\r\nIf
    you haven't received a report that means no units have been shifted."

  body: 'Hi Wayne, I have asked our accounts dept. to give me an update a.s.a.p. on
    all ATF sales and I''ll contact you via email as soon as I have the information.
    Rest assured there''s probably a very simple explanation because any royalties
    due are paid promptly. '

  body: "Wayne, it transpires that our accounts dept. contacted you and your colleague
    Alison earlier in the year requesting that ATF charge our card for the \xA337.50
    due but we heard nothing back. We've made a PayPal payment today for the Q1, Q2
    & Q3 periods, kindly issue an invoice. Seems like there was a communication breakdown
    at your end. "

  body: Well Joe, there's obviously been some kind of miscommunication. I'm not going
    to get into a public argument about it. Will email you privately.
