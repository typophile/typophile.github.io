body: Hello! <BR>My name is Ilya Ruderman. <BR>I&#39;m typedesigner and I&#39;m writing
  paper with some researching in classification and identification of type. It&#39;s
  very &#40;I hope so&#41; important work for Russia and for Cyrillic Typedesign.
  <BR>And if it&#39;s possible to ask you about help - it&#39;ll be very usefull for
  me if you could remember any know to you interesting, unusual, probably strange
  and illogical systems of classification and identification of fonts, and also very
  interesting unsuccessful attempts!  <BR>Also it&#39;s very interesting the principles
  of organization of searching of fonts like TypeFinder or identifont.com - I hope
  you&#39;ll understand what am I talking about <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41;&#41; <BR>I&#39;d greatly appreciate it! Thanks! ;&#41;&#41;
