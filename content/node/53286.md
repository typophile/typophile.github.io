  is a distressed or \u201Cgrunge\u201D version of James Puckett's Recovery typeface.
  The core of the Black Monday type family is a single Opentype font containing three
  full character sets of varying degrees of distressing treatment. Every glyph in
  each of the subsets is unique to provide an organically weathered look and feel.
  Opentype scripting rotates through the character sets to automatically generate
  a pseudo-random look.\r\n\r\nThe three distinct glyph sets are also available as
  individual fonts for use in applications that do not yet support the Stylistic Sets
  Opentype feature. These styles are identified as Subset 1, Subset 2, and Subset
  3, while the full version is simply \"Black Monday Regular\".\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=ODEx\">Black
  Monday is available now at www.TypeTrust.com</a>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/black_monday_5879.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BlackMonday3_3929.gif]\r\n\r\nAnd
  to give credit where it\u2019s due: Recovery and Black Monday are based on the work
  of Charles Coiner and the typeface Eagle Bold by M.F. Benton."

    (or is it a \"stylistic set\"--it's not clear here), and not \"contextual alternates\"?"

  body: "@Nick: Silas can explain it better\u2014the LIGA method, and the code that
    produced it, was his brilliance\u2014but LIGA is more widely supported than CALT.
    The stylistic sets allow the results of the randomizer to be quickly changed.
    And everything has alternates configured so that the user can quickly change the
    results at any given character.\r\n\r\nThe subset fonts allow for a single, less
    chaotic look to be chosen; each set was distressed using a different technique
    and suffered less damage. In subset one the letters are nearly annihilated, in
    subset three they\u2019re just weathered. The subset fonts also allow manual randomization
    in applications that do not support the other OpenType features."

  body: "<em>The stylistic sets allow the results of the randomizer to be quickly
    changed. </em>\r\n\r\nThat's clever.\r\n\r\nIt suggests an improvement to a random
    effect I put into Duffy Script, whereby the user can \"bump\" the sequence of
    characters in a word by inserting space(s) in front of a word. (Sort of like spinning
    the tumblers, to get a different look each time.) But being able to apply different
    Stylistic Sets, each of which will produce a different sequence, would be better."
