  font metrics.  When using it in Word it seems to behave in a very strange way, especially
  when you compare it to PowerPoint.\r\n\r\nIn PowerPoint when I lay out it seems
  to auto-clip the whitespace at the bottom. The Save as PDF produces what I would
  expect.\r\n\r\nBut in Word it's a different story where it seems to put in some
  extra space (or is not intelligent enough to remove unnecessary space). Word's PDF
  output is even worse.  I had to do a really strange hack with a textbox to get it
  to output correctly in PDF and print formats.\r\n \r\nAny thoughts on what about
  the font may be causing this?"

  body: "This may be an issue with how the font renders in the PDF. MS Office most
    likely exports the words as <em>text</em> rather than <em>outlines</em>. In better
    layout programs you have the option to export the shapes of the letters rather
    than embedding the text. This will ensure your exported PDF looks the same as
    your original layout.\r\n\r\nThere is a great free program called [[http://inkscape.org/|Inkscape]]
    that is easy to learn and will let you have more control over the PDF output. "

  body: "No offense intended to Ezra, who doubtless was trying to be helpful, but
    the above post is >50% nonsense. Please beware.\r\n\r\nExporting text in PDF as
    text rather than converting to outlines is usually preferable, and results in
    better rendering of the text on low-res devices, including on screen.\r\n\r\nYour
    problem almost certainly has to do with the vertical metrics built into the font
    being a bit odd. \r\n\r\n(1) The font has large bounding box settings, quite possibly
    legitimately (because it has some capitals which extend a whole lot further up
    or down than the most common letters). Some \"office\" type applications use this
    information for spacing, and will clip anything that extends beyond that. You
    can override the default spacing in Word by setting spacing to be a specific number
    of points instead of \"auto.\" This may result in clipping, however.\r\n\r\n(2)
    Additionally, there may be something else weird about the vertical metrics which
    is causing some odd shifting between what you see on screen and creating the PDF.
    Bringing it into FontLab Studio or the like and regenerating it with \"auto\"
    settings for metrics will probably fix the problem.\r\n\r\n(3) What are you using
    to create the PDF?\r\n\r\nIt is true that more advanced applications will tend
    to do a better job of line spacing on screen, without clipping on screen, but
    this has little to do with PDF output per se.\r\n\r\nPost your original misbehaving
    Word doc and I'll be curious to check it out.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
