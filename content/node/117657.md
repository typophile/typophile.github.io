  to be based on a template I purchased. \r\n What I basically require to be modified
  is the logo, texts, images including portfolio, accommodation of the menu titles
  to the subjects of the pages, some color scheme changes, setting up a contact form,
  having some redundant elements removed. \r\nHere's the template I will use for my
  site so you get the idea about the extent of work \r\n flashmint.com/show-template-4652.html\r\n
  And lastly I need installation as well \r\nThank you!!!"

    to that site.  \r\n\r\nIf not, the poster should try a different site as this
    isn't the place to find web masters."
