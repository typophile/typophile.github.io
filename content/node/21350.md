  of text, came about ? My half-baked theory is that back in the seventeenth century
  and before, when the norm for text type was black ink on white paper, the term \"color\"
  was used as a metaphor because no one of any consequence would actually mistake
  text \"color\u201D as being text hue. "

    the already capricious spelling of English took place, I believe, after the war
    of 1812 (between the US and England); and they were done mainly out of spite,
    I think.\r\n\r\nOf course being irrationality piled on top of irrationality they
    have lasted for nearly two centuries.\r\n\r\nSo you see how far being logical
    will move public policy :) or is that :(   \r\n\r\n--Is there an 'I don't know

  body: "Typographers and type designers try to avoid local contrasts in colour, \"hot
    spots\" that stand out from the general tone of the text (although an overall
    lack of colour can, conversely, be problematic). The reason for this aversion
    is partly aesthetic--one likes one's pasta <em>al dente</em>)--and partly functional,
    as obtrusive features tend to disrupt fluent reading.\r\n\r\nCOLOUR ISSUES\r\n1.
    Hot-spots caused by poor global spacing. For instance, if the sidebearings on
    vertical strokes are too narrow, relative to those on curved verticals, then double-l
    etc. will create clots in text. \r\n2. Hot spots caused by glyph shapes that fit
    awkwardly. The f ligatures address this. Double-g of the two-bowl kind is hard
    to avoid.\r\n3. Hot spots caused by glyphs of abnormal weight. At the extreme,
    a bold condensed sans serif M or W tends to overpower other characters. \r\n4.
    Hot spots caused by ink trapped in acute joints: even the tiniest overinking can
    exacerbate this, affecting glyphs like the said M and W disproportionately.\r\n5.
    Entangled ascenders and descenders. \r\n6. Rivers in justified text.\r\n7. If
    the space character is too wide or too narrow, text will be too halted or too
    slurred.\r\n8. Emphasis fonts that don't harmonize with the main style. For instance,
    a bold weight can look too extended, or an italic too fussy.\r\n9. Lining figures
    (tabular, no doubt) to be replaced by old-style.    \r\n10. Excessive case disparity:
    this is why Goudy found Caslon wanting, \"...a spotty appearance, largely due
    to the strong contrast in color between the capitals and the lower-case...\" and
    designed Kennerley. So typographic colour is also an historical, cultural, and
    subjective quality.\r\n\r\nDenise, I'm afraid I don't know the source of the usage,
    but given the variety of factors affecting the quality of colour, from type design
    to layout specs to press gain to personal preference, I'd be inclined to agree
    with you that this somewhat perverse, broadly metaphorical term does seem appropriate,
    for what is really the distinctly typographic personality of massed text. "
