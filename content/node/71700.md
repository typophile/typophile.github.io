  body: "Florian, your 'bump' is like a fisherman bouncing a worm in front of a fish.
    You probably thought I would take this bait and run with it ;-)\r\n\r\nI looked
    through the ClickArt collection of Handwritten Fonts, but this was not in it.
    I will check some freebie sites - the hook has been set...\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    by 'Unknown', which makes me a little uneasy. This was on the 31st page of 36
    pages of Handwriting fonts (shown 30 at a time). \r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I checked Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide, and didn't see it, so at least
    it's not something I have collected before. I just didn't want to find a commercial
    font that looked like this, although I know my Guide is not the last word.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Oh dear, 31/36! Thanks, Mike, for your patience. Your ambition is admirable.
    I have no reason to believe Notepad is an illegitimate clone.\r\n\r\nI bumped
    this thread because it accidentally had been placed in the \u2018Critique\u2019
    forum. I moved it to the Type ID Board, but it already was too old for appearing
    on the first page. "
