  body: Also, I have good reason to believe it is NOT Neutraface because the designer
    who designed it  (from 99Designs) , gave it to my client and the widths of all
    the letters were different, like it's a crazy copycat font. So... I'm looking
    for that copycat font. I'm guessing that if the designer had used Neutraface,
    the widths wouldn't have been goofy.

  body: Width of letters can be changed easily in PhotoShop, InDesign etc. - that
    does not mean it is not a copycat font but the shapes are still right on for Neutraface.

  body: Sorry, I meant the width of the letters were all wonky and inconsistent- reminiscent
    of using font that's not executed correctly.  I'm looking for that font. If she
    used Neutraface, it's perfect and beauitful.  I'm sure she wouldn't have changed
    the width of the letters from perfect and consistent to inconsistent and wonky.
    Does that make sense?

  body: Once you know it is BubbleBoddy and compare with Neutraface it is not as close
    as the original letters implied - glad you found it Cort.
