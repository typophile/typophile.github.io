  is complete, please be kind to <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com\">Macromedia</a>.
  \r\n\r\nFireworks is 100x better than ImageReady. So make sure you know which limb
  to amputate before the anesthesiologist arrives.\r\n\r\nOh, and in case it wasn't
  clear, Golive is teh suk. Dreamweaver is the good one... Chop accordingly.\r\n\r\nKeep
  Photoshop for photo editing and Fireworks for web production. You put the PHOTO
  in Photoshop, now don't make it EVERYTHINGshop.\r\n\r\nDon't try to turn SWF into
  a giant PDF engine. PDF is cool and SWF is cool, but for different reasons. If the
  twain meet, just make sure it's a good idea first, okay.\r\n\r\nCheers, and many
  happy ROIs!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/macrodobia.png]"

    as hell will miss it, if they decide to 'amputate' it..</em>\r\n\r\nI also will
    deeply miss 'Freehand', but I think this part is already history, sadly enough..\r\n\r\nViva
    la Macromedia.. :)\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: I'm a Fireworks fan, too. I use it for all my site graphics and gif animation.
    My only complaint (well, only <em>big</em> complaint) is that it is not OpenType-aware,
    which makes it  hard to use for making samples of OpenType fonts on my site, for
    example.

  body: OpenType-awareness... now there's a plus of the acquisition. Hopefully we'll
    see this across their entire armada of products.
