body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeliciousBlog_5692.jpg]\r\nThe assignment
  was to take an sketchbook assignment and bring it into the computer and make it
  better. I chose my simple sketch of the word delicious, which is made out of chocolate
  strawberries. I thought chocolate strawberries would be a delicious thing to create
  the word. It is better formally now because I used a picture of real chocolate covered
  strawberries with melted chocolate as the background which makes your mouth water.
  I'm not sure what time period it most relates to. But I sure do think chocolate
  strawberries are delicious thats why I used them to represent the word. And I certainly
  think many people would agree:)"
