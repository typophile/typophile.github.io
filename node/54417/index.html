		<div class="commentbody">sIFR is about as protective as using straight-up images - someone could theoretically trace your letter shapes from any posted image. With a SWF the only difference is that the vectors could potentially be decompiled from the SWF (or like someone running autotrace on your lettershapes). But no metrics would be available. And you can subset the amount of glyphs that are embedded within the SWF, thus reducing even more what could potentially be pulled out of the SWF. At any rate, anyone going through that much effort to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; a font from a SWF values their time much more differently then I would.</div>

<p>When you&rsquo;ve been robbed blind, and see other folks being robbed you develop a sense of paranoia. For smaller foundries it&rsquo;s kind of like the guy running the small corner shop, who has a &ldquo;no more than two school children at a time&rdquo; sign. The larger vendors write off the thievery as part of the cost of doing business, which equals less paranoia.</p>

I guess I have to ask for the long answer concerning embedding with sIFR. I must say my position as consumer is rather frustrating. While their EULA did not seem overly limiting, it looks like it isn&rsquo;t clear enough either. With the current limitations of web typography, methods like sIFR (or @font-face) are a breath of fresh air. But are they secure? Here&rsquo;s the paragraph from the EULA that regulates embedding ([[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/help/ptflicense.html|Link]]).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embedding of the Fonts into web pages or digital documents is permitted only in a secured, read-only mode. You must ensure that recipients of such web pages or documents cannot extract, install or use the embedded Fonts. The creation of new documents using an embedded copy of the Font Software is expressly prohibited. You further agree not to change or alter the embedding bits or other restrictions of the embedding programs within the Font Software itself.</p>

<p>First, thanks Dan for taking the time to understand our EULA and investigate whether it meets your needs before you purchase. That&rsquo;s really a best-case scenario.</p>
<p>If you are to follow the advice that Andy linked to about protecting the files/font, then you should be within the bounds of our EULA and we would have no issue with that usage.</p>
<p>Towards the notion of security. &lsquo;Secure&rsquo; is difficult to define. There are few methods of font usage that are 100% secure, so we cannot expect a customer to keep our fonts 100% secure. Even in the print world, simply giving the file to a service bureau (which is allowed in our EULA) is not necessarily secure. But, we&rsquo;ve tried to strike a balance between protecting our work from unreasonable, unlicensed distribution and giving customers usage rights that do not unduly burden their use of the fonts.</p>
<p>So, we don&rsquo;t expect a customer to &lsquo;guarantee&rsquo; the security of the fonts, which is simply not possible, but we do expect that they take reasonable measures to protect the fonts when they use them in ways that potentially put them at risk of unlicensed distribution.</p>

<p>Si- I understand where you&rsquo;re coming from. In a world where everyone respects EULAs, &lsquo;best efforts&rsquo; makes sense, but we know that&rsquo;s not the world we live in. There is still so much room for interpretation in the phrase. My &lsquo;best effort&rsquo; as a cyclist, for example, is not even in the same universe as Lance Armstrong&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The EULA is written for the person who makes every effort to abide by its terms and those who willfully disregard it. It is not always an easy balance. We&rsquo;ll keep thinking about it though, especially since these issues are becoming more and more pressing by the day.</p>
