body: "ok, so having taken aesthetic and functional considerations to mind, and having
  drawn up detailed sketches of one roman weight of your new typeface, how do you
  go about creating several other weights (just roman) of your font? I've heard it's
  best to make fontlab transformations from your heaviest weight to your lightest
  intended, and tweak from then on. But I simply have no experience other than drawing
  one offs... I'm toying with the idea of expanding out a little sans of mine, and
  would really appreciate the many years experience of this board.\r\n"
