body: "Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m new at this forum, although I\u2019ve been
  reading it since a very long time. My name is Mauricio Villamayor, I'm designing
  a calligraphic typeface for my thesis and I have a problem in doing it. I hope if
  you can help me with this situation.\r\n\r\nBasically, the problem is with the ligatures.
  The typography has a lot of them, since the calligraphic characters are more complicated
  to bond harmonically. The ligatures work in all the combinations, except in the
  accented (acute accent) letters.\r\nFor example, a specific ligature exists for
  the combination \u201Cyo\u201D (which works), but when I create the combination
  \u201Cy\xF3\u201D, it doesn\u2019t work, indicating an error when I compile the
  ligaduras.\r\n\r\nThis is the specific error that shows:\r\n\"[FATAL] <Caleidoscopio>
  invalid token (text was \"\xF3\") [C:/Users/Maui/Documents/FontLab/Studio5/fontlab.fea
  4]\"\r\n \r\nIs it possible to create ligaduras with accented letters? Or am I doing
  something wrong?\r\nMaybe an error in the language configuration of the font?\r\nI
  searched a lot on the Internet about what could be the problem, but nobody seems
  to have a problem like mine (maybe because in English there are no accented letters).\r\nI
  would be really thankful if you could help me, I never had to do ligaduras with
  accented letters and right now I\u2019m in a hurry since this work is for my thesis.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much!"

  body: "You need to use correct glyph names. The error implies that your Opentype
    code contains \"\xF3\" where it should say \"oacute\". Every glyph name must start
    with a letter and may only contain A-Z, a-z, numerals, underscore (for ligatures),
    and period (to suffix alternates). If you give a glyph a name that does not fit
    these criteria, it cannot be referenced in the code. So, for example, the y\xF3
    ligature glyph should be named \"y_oacute\"."
