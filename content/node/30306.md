  to finally post. I choose the crit section because eventually that's what this will
  be.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to decide on the best way to use my name (Chris Butts) as
  my freelance design identity. The reasons to use it are because it's different,
  memorable, and the thing I'm known for. The reasons not to use it are because it
  can be associated with obvious things like toilets and well... crap.\r\n\r\nLately
  I've been thinking that spelling the name is enough and that I don't need some rendering
  of a rear end next to it. I've always been interested in typography and thought
  this might be a time where a purely typographic logo solution is in order. I'm doing
  some typographic thumbnails and will post them soon.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have
  any thoughts on this. I'd like to hear what others think!"

    logo? Also welcome and maybe some background info about your company?

    body: "Well... the process has just started. I've been drawing my name out and
      I have a few hand lettered versions that I like. I'm trying to do a lot of stuff
      based off of my handwriting which is an all caps style that most say looks like
      a draftsman's handwriting.\r\n\r\nThere's no background to my company yet. I'm
      a design student who's been doing freelance work for a while now. I don't have
      anything to put in front of people explaining who I am and what I do, so I figure
      now is the time. I don't do any web design. Everything is for print. Most of
      my jobs have been logo design, brochures, and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nYeah,
      grade school was fun! I did think about using a cigarette butt. I did a whole
      mess of thumbnails using different kinds of butts besides the human kind. I
      like your idea of going super clean with it though.\r\n\r\nI've been trying
      to decide for the longest time whether or not to use the name or make up a new
      name. To ingnore it seemed wrong so here I am. If I can't get it to work I'll
      try something else. I'm definately not wanting people to associate my work with
      a toilet though.\r\n\r\nOne of the ideas I came up with that I seem to like
      is using parenthesis as a subtle image of a butt. Something like this...\r\n\r\n(chris)(butts)\r\n\r\nI
      don't want to get stuck on it though, so I'm trying to push myself to come up
      with many good ideas before I select just a few.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"Chris Butts\"\r\n\r\nOh dear. Must have been tough in grade school, eh?
    ;o)\r\n\r\nI like the idea of an all typographic logo. 'Butts' sounds dirty, and
    it might be nice to render it in some over-the-top elegant/swashy calligraphic
    typeface.\r\n\r\nThat or a used ashtray. Maybe take random photos of used cigarettes
    and use them as your identity elements. "

    However, this may be a good reason to not use it as your freelance idenity. By
    creating a different name, you can develop a completely diffent identity for your
    freelance business -- all the while avoiding conjuring associations with the commode.
    \r\n\r\nIf you do decide to stick with naming your freelance business after yourself,
    definitely avoid the potty humor. Select characteristics of your work with which
    you'd like an audience to connect. "
