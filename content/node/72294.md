  teach Islamic art at a university in Brazil. As I'm afraid I'm going to have to
  do a lot of writing and translation for my future students, I'd like a suggestion
  of a font that fits that kind of work. For my thesis I used Arno (typeset in Latex).
  Now that I'll be a professor, I guess I'll have some money to spend on (other) fonts.
  But it must be one for extensive use, not just for one or two papers, and with all
  ligatures and old style numbers. I'd also like it to have a \"modern\" feel. If
  I need to write in Arabic, I guess the Arabic Typesetting font seems the best choice
  around.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: "Re. Arabic text:\r\n\r\nDo you plan to continue using LaTeX, or are you open
    to other software? I recommend taking a look at the Middle East version of Adobe
    InDesign, which includes the Tasmeem plug-in for which you can purchase special
    Arabic fonts including DecoType's Naskh and award-winning Nastaliq. In the context
    of your work, I think the great benefit of using Tasmeem is that your Arabic text
    would reflect the canons of Islamic aesthetics, i.e. the form of the text would
    reinforce what you are teaching.\r\n\r\nFor English text, you could do a lot worse
    than Arno Pro, and it will harmonise pretty nicely with a traditional naskh Arabic.
    Personally, I'm a huge fan of Kepler, which has a more modern feel than Arno,
    but it might not harmonise so well with the Arabic."

    need to write in Arabic. Do you think it's livelier than Arno for that kind of
    job?\r\nI'll give InDesign a try in the future, but I'm afraid it will take me
    a lot of time learn the basics."

  body: "If he is going to teach Islamic art, then fonts like FF Amman are out of
    consideration.\r\n\r\nTasmeem is pretty good, but one need experience in Arabic
    calligraphy and rules, Tasmeem gives you tools to shoot yourself in the foot,
    I've seen both very good and very ugly (ugly to the degree that I'd consider it
    a calligraphic <em>crime</em>) work done with it.\r\n\r\nArabic typesetting looks
    best as a display font, but too light for body text (in my experience, people
    find it unreadable)."

  body: "Dear Khaled,\r\n\r\nI agree with you about Tasmeem. I realy think you need
    to be a very good Arabic calligrapher to profit from Tasmeem--which of course
    I'm not.\r\n\r\nI was just looking to a readable font for small chunks of text
    in Arabic (instead of using only the Latin alphabet for transcriptions). If Arabic
    typesetting is not good for that, what alternatives are there? Scheherazade? Traditional
    Arabic?"

  body: I think Arabic Typesetting would do just fine for your use case, though you
    might want to set it in larger point size than the Latin text. You have to try
    your self anyway. Scheherazade have almost no ligatures except the four basic
    shapes for each letter, Traditional Arabic is better but still not as complete
    as it should (and some of its ligatures are rather weird or plain wrong).

  body: "Tasmeem comes with a set of Text Shaping pre-sets that can be relied on for
    basic styles of text, including one that represents a typical book style, the
    sort a scribe would use for copying a long text, as distinct from the kind of
    elaborations found in calligraphy. Yes, if one enters into the Word Shaping options
    or starts editing the Text Shaping options, then one needs to have a sense of
    the calligraphic aesthetics, but there's no need to engage in that side of Tasmeem
    at all: you can just select your text, switch to the Tasmeem Naskh font, and select
    \u2018Naskh Standard\u2019 from the Text Shaping pre-sets. You get something pretty
    typical of jobbing scribal work:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tasnaskh_4062.png]\r\n\r\nFor
    modern texts, I prefer a more obvious distinction between inter-word spacing and
    intra-word spacing. These can be easily and globally edited using Tasmeem's Arabic
    Spacing controls."

    need kerning.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if d,h,s,t, and z with the dotbelow are in the
    foundry version, either.\r\n\r\nArno's native kerning doesn't survive a trip through
    Fontlab. If you want to add just one kern, you do all he kerning over.\r\n\r\nFrom

  body: "Charles, that's true. I hadn't considered the Latin font needs from the perspective
    of Arabic transliteration. That cuts down the options considerably, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe
    new version of Cambria that ships with Windows 7 supports all the necessary diacritics,
    including smallcap support.\r\n\r\nThe version of Minion that ships within the
    Adobe Arabic fonts does also, although it should be noted that this weight of
    Minion is incompatible with the common versions, as it was generated to harmonise
    with the Arabic; it also lacks smallcap support."

    didn't know that Cambria had the diacritics, though.\r\n\r\nThe Tasmeem example
    looks very nice, and doesn't seem very tricky. I'll definitely give a try in the
    next few weeks. Thanks a lot for the comments."

  body: "Your \"hack\" (AKA \"macro\" or \"definition\" in TeX) is just fine for preparing
    material for students. But likely your professional carrier will require both
    journal articles and books. Many of the journals do have a standard style for
    submitting manuscripts, books less so. Point is, editors will have to be able
    to open & work with your files. Oft times, LaTex (or any TeX) won't be acceptable.
    MS Word is the standard text editor, with the characters in proper Unicode.\r\n\r\nThe
    other issue is color management. Plain Tex, which we used with an extensive set
    of macros, wasn't good at it. This was the biggest reason we shifted to InDesign.
    InDesign's H&J algorithms are dreadful to one use to TeX, but while the color
    management can be difficult, it can provide what you need. Just how involved an
    author needs to be with color management is a separate question, but art usually
    involves images, and color management is critical there. "

  body: I used ConTeXt (a TeX based macro package akin to LaTeX and plain TeX) to
    typeset books that went for print, it had all colour management feature that I
    needed (my books are Arabic, with no single mathematical formula; not the typical
    TeX user). I know many journals that do accept TeX and LaTeX (and I know for at
    least one big scientific publishing house here that is based on LaTeX), but it
    depends on what field you are into.

    to know what the original image really looked like. You can have all the technical
    capability in the world at the publishing/printing end, but even though you may
    know the characteristics of the press and paper the image will print on (i.e,
    have a perfect ICC profile for the press), the person preparing the art for printing
    will have no idea what the original looks like beyond the supplied image.\r\n\r\nBut
    you're right, the color management problems we encountered were in preparing mixed
    halftones and color, where the images ran with the text (not a gallery), using
    our version of Plain TeX. That may not hold for other implementations of TeX.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I really used Latex just for having a decent output with little effort. As
    far as I know, either no Middle East Studies or Arts journal would accept Latex.\r\n\r\nI
    was just concerned to have a decent, nice-looking font (I still haven't decided
    between Arno and Kepler) and a good typesetting engine to translate some book
    chapters and papers for my students. \r\n\r\nAll printing will be done on a4 or
    letter paper, by a standard laser color printer (which I'll probably have to buy
    myself). All this work is because I fear very few students will be able to read
    the original textbooks, and as far as I know Brazilian publishing houses have
    no interest in publishing such time-consuming, fancy books. "
