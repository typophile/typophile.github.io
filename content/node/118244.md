  is the font with the loppy W in \"weekend\" or \"whale\"\r\nI contacted a couple
  of people on Etsy who use it on their products and 1 hasn't responded yet and the
  other said, \"I don't share fonts\". So that made me even more determined to find
  it! :)\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bachfont1_6522.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontfind_3590.jpg]\r\n\r\nSOLVED!"

    for personal use)\r\n\r\nBut I doubt they designed the font (I found several people
    on Deviant Art who appear to claim ownership and offer it for download).\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know if this is a rip-off of a legitimate, commercial font?"
