body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Camel Case</strong>\r\n\r\nCamel case,
  or camelCase refers to formatting commonly used in some programming languages to
  create functions or name classes of objects. \r\n\r\nCamel case most often manifests
  itself as a conjunction of two words (with no space in between) where only the second
  word gets capitalized, as in objectMarker or contentBucket.\r\n\r\nCamel case should
  not be confused with an [[intercap]]."
