body: "Hello to everyone!\r\n\r\nI am happy to reopen the critique section of the
  new typophille forum with a new take of an older typeface that I developed with
  the help of some people from the old forum (if you are interested, the thread is
  this one http://www.typophile.com/node/120647).\r\n\r\nMell Sans is my first serious
  font design project (though I made a couple of display faces a couple of years ago).\r\nIt
  is based on some well-known typefaces, like DIN and Futura, but has some characteristics
  of its own:\r\n- The subtle cursive shape of \"b\", \"d\", \"q\" and \"g\".\r\n-
  The thicker horizontal strokes at the end of the curves of \"e\", \"c\", \"a\" etc.\r\n-
  The old-style \"t\". \r\n\r\nWhere it stands out for me is:\r\n-  Compressed letters,
  which save space.\r\n- It is very legible in small sizes\r\n- It has character (I
  hate generic designs).\r\n\r\nWhat you see are the bold and semibold weights. I
  plan to expand the family\r\n with more styles and possibly a monospaced version.\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback is very welcome.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added a new version. Check mell_sans_2.pdf"

  body: "For me it's seems to have some potential in this design. I will only give
    you some technical comments. There is some touch up to do on curve. See the bump
    on the left side of the top of the \u201Cb\u201D bold, same on \u201Cg, m, n,
    h\u201D. The \u201Ct\u201D could be a bit higher and its bottom is a bit to wide,
    the dot of the \u201Ci\u201D a bit too big. I will change the connection of the
    \u201Ca,u\u201D to their stems to looks more like the bottom of the \u201Cb\u201D.
    The roundness of the \u201Ce\u201D should be more like the \u201Co\u201D. Keep
    going."

  body: "Hi Andr\xE9,\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments. I spent a few hours experimenting
    with the things you suggested and I am attaching the result.\r\n\r\n- I haven't
    yet fixed the curve of \"b\" bold. I will concentrate on the regular version first.
    I actually did the bold version just so the specimen isn't too poor.\r\n\r\n-
    I made the top of \"t\" a bit bigger (higher and also wider). It looks a lot better.\r\n
    \r\n- I also made its bottom of \"t\" a bit smaller (by \"closing\" the stroke
    a bit). This change is also reflected in \"c\", \"j\" \"e\" and other characters.
    I like it because it enhances the cursive nature of the typeface, which is already
    prominent in \"p\", \"b\", \"q\" etc.\r\n\r\n- Regarding the dot of \"i\" - I
    actually wanted it to be exaggerated. The fact that you don't see it as such makes
    me consider exaggerating it even more. What do you think?\r\n\r\n- I am a bit
    hesitant to change \"a\" and \"u\". If I do that, Mell sans won't be a cursive
    typeface anymore. I will try this idea out tomorrow.\r\n\r\n- I fixed \"e\" and
    it looks better.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the feedback."

  body: Hard to tell in this resolution, but are the corners of the "v" a little more
    rounded than other stems? Looking at the "iv" in initiative, the "i" seems more
    edgy than the "v".

  body: "It indeed seems inconsistent once you mentioned. it.\r\nMaybe I should only
    leave the cuts (they are cuts, not rounded corners) in the places where they exist
    for traditional Grotesks (the lower and upper corners of\"V\", \"W\" \"A\" etc).\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    I included a PDF at the beginning of the thread."

  body: "For many of your curves that sprout from a stem, the apex of the outer contour
    is too close to the stem, creating a lumpy, asymmetrical look; you need to move
    that point further out. This is most noticeable on the top of n and p, and the
    bottom of d.\r\n\r\nYour i and j dots seem overly large.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot
    of optical issues that are best worked out with a much smaller character set,
    before expanding things to a full font."

  body: "Thanks. Maybe I should go back to my original idea about keeping \"d\" \"b\"
    etc symmetric from the outside (and asymmetric from the inside).\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    I could never manage design characters in isolation. Currently maintaining a full
    font does not bother me, thanks to \"Glyphs\" - most shapes exist only once as
    components in which I reuse for different characters. "

    \"g\"\r\n- A wider \"s\"\r\n- A \"t\" with a bigger top (as per Andr\xE9's advice)\r\n-
    Redesigned \"b\",\"d\",\"m\",\"n\" etc. (as per Andr\xE9 and Thomas (may still
    be wrong))\r\n- I also removed some of the cuts, of \"v\", \"k\" etc. following
