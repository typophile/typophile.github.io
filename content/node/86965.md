body: "Dear Bezier and Math Masers,\r\n\r\nfor a piece of software I'm writing for
  some time now I need to calculate points on a Bezier curve. These points need to
  be of exactly identical absolute distance from each other.\r\nAt the moment I'm
  using the common SplitCubicAtT function (T of which is a float between 0 and 1)
  to part the curve into two with T being 0.5 at first, then calculate the distance
  between P1 and P1,4 using the Pythagoreic Triangle. Then I repeat the calculation
  with increasing or decreasing T until the difference in distance is below a certain
  threshold (= binary search). But this method is 1) slow and 2) not precise.\r\n\r\n<img

  result is (among other points) the point P1,4. The difference of position in x and
  y direction between P1,4 and P1 is used in \r\nStep 2: to calculate the absolute
  distance between P1 and P1,4 using the <strong>Pythagoreic Triangle</strong>.\r\n\r\nFrom
  what I understand there should be a possibility to invert the combination of these
  two funtions so one could hand over the absolute distance and receive the positions
  of the P1,4.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see from here this classifies as rocket science,

  body: "The cubic Bezier can be written as a vector-valued function (x(t),y(t)) parameterized
    by the single variable t for 0<=t<=1.  You want to find the value of t such that
    the distance from (x(t),y(t)) to P1 is a fixed value.  Thus, (as Miha said) you
    wish to solve the equation sqrt((x(t)-P1.x)^2+(y(t)-P1.y)^2)=constant (*).  Moving
    the constant to the left side, you want to find when the function f(t)=sqrt((x(t)-P1.x)^2+(y(t)-P1.y)^2)-constant
    is equal to 0 for 0<=t<=1.  This can be efficiently solved using Newton's Method;
    this will be significantly faster than the binary search approach you described
    above since it uses information from the derivative.  Newton's Method is iterative
    but converges quickly, so you can quickly compute the answer to the level of precision
    that you need.\r\n\r\nOne trick to simplify applying Newton's Method is to square
    both sides of equation (*) first.  This will give the same t value, but then the
    function f(t) becomes a polynomial in t.  This is easier to differentiate.  The
    resulting polynomial has degree 6, and so there is no closed form solution (in
    general) for the roots.  However, Newton's Method does converge quadratically.\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious as to what you are using this for.  This is not one of the typical computations
    done with Bezier curves.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nStephen\r\n"

  body: "@hrant: heh, thanks.\r\n\r\n@sgh: You are absolutely correct, the convergence
    of Newton's method is much faster than bisection. However, Newton's method can
    fail to converge when the relationship is not approximately linear, which can
    definitely happen with cubic Bezier segments when the control points are \"kinky.\"
    Bisection is much more robust in that case, as it's pretty much guaranteed to
    converge at _something_ in range of the solution.\r\n\r\nOne approach which might
    be more robust than Newton but converge faster than bisection is the secant method.
    Actually this has the added advantage that you don't need to analytically compute
    the derivatives, as well. I've used it quite a bit in my spline foo.\r\n\r\nThere
    are other approaches to the problem which could work, but they could get hairy.
    If you can decompose your beziers into circular arcs, then the problem reduces
    to computing the intersection between two circles, which is quite simple. Here's
    a reference on that:\r\n\r\nhttp://itc.ktu.lt/itc354/Riskus354.pdf\r\n\r\nAnd,
    what @sgh said, it's hard for me to imagine why you really need this.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

    hairy for me.\r\nSo let me continue with answering the question to the why.\r\nI'm
    working on a type design software plugin that illustrates curve speed on top of
    bezier outlines, live while editing outlines.\r\nIn order to calculate the amount
    of curvature I'm calculating on-curve points in equal distance, then calculating
    the angle between them. Just cutting a curve segment into equal parts using SplitCubicAtT
    doesn't work because distance and hence angle will change when a curve becomes
    tighter, so angle calculation is useless. They need to be in equal absolute distance
    from each other.\r\n\r\nBut, thinking about it, i just had another idea. When
    distance between on-curve points (returned by SplitCubicAtT) decreases with increasing
    curvature, there's already the numerical basis for my illustration, right?\r\nHere's
    another problem, though: This might work only per segment. How to sync illustrations
    between segments, when an equal amount of splits per segment will always return
    different distances, since segment lengths differ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/speedpunk_6263.png]"

    curve speed) in a more general way, using the general cubic Bezier equation.\r\nI've
    constructed the first (and to be sure, also the second)  derivative, as suggested.
    Please correct me, if I made mistakes there. School was a looong time ago.\r\nThe
    function solveCubic return as the first argument p1234 (identical to the middle
    on-curve point calculated by the known splitCubicAtT function, I just skipped
    the other points for now), then the result of the first derivative, then the second.\r\nAll
    are vectors (or coordinates).\r\n\r\nThe segment used for the results posted below
    (with t as 0.1 steps) is a quarter of a circle, or a quarter of as close a circle
    as one can construct with Beziers. The first derivative should then have all equal
    (more or less) values, right, in case of a circle? In other words, curve speed
    should be steady at all positions in a circle.\r\nBut the results differ by 8%,
    even more in the second derivative. This doesn't look right. I've double-checked
    for a correct circle pie piece.\r\n\r\nBut maybe I have a misunderstanding of
