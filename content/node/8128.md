  body: Paul, <BR>I too have been baffled by this error. As near as I can surmise,
    it means there is a stray point around that used to join the line which shows
    the error.  For me, it is usually a point hidden behind another one.  I don&#39;t
    know what the term &#34;move is empty&#34; means.  Maybe Adam Twardoch will answer
    for us? <BR> <BR>ChrisL
