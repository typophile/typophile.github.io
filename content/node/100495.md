  question that has been bugging me for a while and is very simple: when does the
  letter-spacing process ends and begins the kerning one??\r\n\r\nI will try to explain
  myself.\r\nI been letter spacing the glyphs in a font following both the Walter
  Tracy's and Miguel Sousa's method for comparison purposes, but no matter how much
  I tweak the glyphs, there always seem to be pairs that look a little bit off, irregular,
  no matter what I do when setting the \"abcde...\" text string. I know that those
  \"problem\" pairs can be easily fixed with kerning modification, but I'm not sure
  whether it's really a kerning problem or just that my letter spacing sucked in the
  first place.\r\n\r\nSo, how perfect can I expect my letter spacing to be without
  kerning? Is there such a thing as a perfect letter spacing without kerning or should
  I expect some little deviations and off spacing witch certain letter combinations??\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the insight!"

    if your font is monospaced or the design lends itself naturally to harmonious
    spacing (and even then it is a matter of perspective based on your perception
    vs. that of the people that use your font). It sounds like you are ready for the
    kerning phase."

    is always a matter of compromise. Letters will space too tightly in certain combinations,
    and too loose with others. Letterfitting is a matter of balancing out the tight
    combinations with the loose ones so that the overall texture is as even as possible.
    \r\n\r\nAs Karl says, spacing is very subjective, but it's advisable to give letters
    sidebearings that work in the largest number of combinations and use kerning to
    fix difficult pairs. Most designers would not for example kern rounds positively/oo/,
    some will kern /fo/ and /ro/ and most (?) would kern /vo/ and similar shapes."

  body: "The trick is to first come up with spacing for key letters that will never
    require kerning to each other. Typically, in Latin fonts these will be the straight
    sided letters H and i. Then you assign sidebearings to all other glyphs based
    on spacing relative to these key letters, such that none of the glyphs require
    kerning to the key letters:\r\n\r\nHHAHH\r\nHHBHH\r\nHHCHH\r\n...\r\niiaii\r\niibii\r\niicii\r\n...\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThat
    way you know that your basic spacing is sound, and after that anything that looks
    wrong is a situation for kerning."

  body: "I know of no way to be sure one has done enough spacing before resorting
    to kerning. What I would tell you is that with experience: you will -in advance-
    make the <em>black bodies themselves</em> in a way to reduce spacing and kerning
    issues, and you will -in advance- make the sidebearings in a way to reduce the
    need for kerning <em>irrespective of specific pairs</em> - meaning that you will
    come very close to what the sidebearings need to be even before you try out specific
    problem pairs for reasons of tweaking. So: you cannot Know, but the more and the
    earlier you <em>think</em> the better.\r\n\r\nAlso useful is to determine a \"granularity\"
    to work with: the finest tweak you will make. In an Em of 1000 many accomplished
    designers don't go finer than 5 units (and often as coarse as 10 units for kerning).
    Having this parameter not only saves time/stress but puts you more in control,
    able to robustly increase the quality -by reducing the granularity- across the
    board if needed.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
