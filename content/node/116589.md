    the conversion to cubic failed spectacularly.\r\n\r\nAre you copy-pasting the
    design? From where?"

  body: "The font was originally designed in Fontstruct.\r\nI had someone work on
    the kerning, and they said it must have happened early on when they converted
    it from .TTF to .OTF!\r\nBut it sounded very odd to me, as I didn't know whether
    that was possible.\r\nDoes that sound true to you?\r\nIt's very odd that the angled
    one has added in more points!"

  body: "My first thought is that they used something other than FontLab Studio to
    do the conversion from TTF to OTF. I\u2019ve never seen that result before in
    a conversion.\r\n\r\nFWIW, in the image you show, the angled one and the curved
    one have the exact same number of points. It's just some of what used to be off-curve
    points defining the shape of a curve, are now part of a straight line segment."
