		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The peace signs are a political statement, yes. But as such they are pretty neutral.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I sure as heck hope they're not neutral. Peace isn't a likely outcome of wishful thinking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm opposed to the war for specific moral reasons that I suspect differ from those of a lot of other contributors to this thread. For me, whether the Iraqi people are better or worse off after the war than before is not sufficient reason to either support or oppose the war. Likewise, the justifications put forward by Bush and Blair are largely beside the point. Similarly, Jacques Chirac may be rightly concerned about US hegemony in the Middle East, but that wouldn't in itself be grounds to oppose the war. Quite simply, this war completely fails to conform to the criteria for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just war<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that have been laid down, debated and asserted for some 1,600 years, and which I believe provide the only sound moral guidance to the questions of when a war is just and how a just war should be fought. It is on these grounds that the Pope has spoken out against the war, and I believe his reasoning, and that of his theologians, is sound. I've read the lectures and essays by some US Catholics who attempt to jerry-rig just war philosophy to fit the circumstances, but I am unconvinced by their contortions. Ironically, as a fellow Catholic, John Butler may have a better appreciation of my opposition to the war than some people 'on my side'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Opposing the invasion and occupation of Iraq (this isn't a war) with moral arguments is a waste of energy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I disagree, because I see the moral argument as the only sound one. The fact is, from purely political arguments I could go either way on the Iraq war: hypocrisy and uncertainty of motive and evidence exist on both sides. To try to maintain a consistent position on purely political grounds is futile, because there is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->possibility<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the other side is more correct or less incorrect. The just war tradition provides an ethical framework for looking at any conflict from a non-political perspective, which is its enduring strength. Even if it were now discovered that Saddam Hussein was hiding a nuclear weapons program in the desert and proof positive was found of his intention to sell or give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations, the US invasion of Iraq still failed to meet the criteria of a just war (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ad bello<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at least; I'm not sure that we have enough information to judge US conduct <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in bello<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). The fact that no such evidence is forthcoming is certainly convenient for those opposed to the war. but the moral argument stands whether such evidence is found or not, because such evidence was not in US possession when they launched the war. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The US has not chosen an 'amoral path': the just war tradition and Catholic morality do not provide for amorality. Shooting without being able to clearly see what the target is is not amoral, it is immoral. Exercising our ability to say that it is immoral, and to explain why it is immoral, is never a waste of energy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Mr. Hudson is saying that according to (Catholic) Christianity, there's no such thing as an amoral war.  There is just war, and immoral war; the US has not made the case for a just war, and their actions are immoral. I agree with him completely, and I am impressed by the strong moral stance that the Catholic church (and some, but not all, Protestant denominations) have taken.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If one had no moral standard and judged war simply by &quot;the results&quot;, every victor would be right and every tyrant just. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul</div>

Succinctly, one could say that the just war tradition is necessary for Christians, but Christianity is not necessary to the just war tradition. The idea of a just war, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ad bello<!-- raw HTML omitted --> conditions for such a war and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in bello<!-- raw HTML omitted --> conduct during such a war, can be defined independently of specifically Catholic or Christian ethics (although orthodox Christians would point out that this is because natural law is part of a divinely created order). The idea that a defensive war is just while an aggresive war is not does not require a belief in a deity, a saviour, the resurrection, the real presence of the eucharist, or any other Catholic doctrine. On the other hand, I do believe that ethics divorced from religion have a tendency to become very shaky and may slip into the kind of relativism you describe.</div>
