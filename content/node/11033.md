  notticed some ink traps, a couple of hours later i notticed them in a magazine logo

  body: 'Traps aren&#39;t just for photosetting. They were used  a <i>lot</i> in the
    metal days &#40;even stuff done by pantograph&#41;, and they&#39;re done today
    by the best digital designers. Some people will tell you traps are unnecessary,
    but that&#39;s really only true if you&#39;re just after &#34;efficiency&#34;,
    with less regards for quality - that mentality can also be applied to smallcaps,
    since almost nobody actually uses them! In actuality traps help whenever you set
    small type and/or use &#34;lo-fidelity&#34; printing like in a newspaper - and
    not just by fighting gain, but also by counteracting optical effects. <BR> <BR>You
    don&#39;t want trapping to show in large sizes &#40;unless you like that effect
    - for example Christian Schwartz has been doing that a lot - to good effect&#41;,
    but since digital type favors single masters &#40;no distinction between different
    sizes&#41;, it becomes a trickier decision...  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something you
    might want to check out: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html"

    soon you will be able to put trapping into your fonts with the click of a button
    &#40;if you have FontLab&#41;, for free. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Well, in terms of &#34;amplitude&#34; photo traps are generally bigger, yes&#42;
    - but I haven&#39;t yet developed an appreciation for any <i>structural</i> differences
    they might have. <BR> <BR>&#42; In fact photo had so much gain that they would
    also often put &#34;thorns&#34; at corners, to prevent rounding-off. <BR> <BR>The
    traps in the first sample are pretty classic. <BR>But that &#34;4&#34; is strange.
    Besides being very small, those traps are asymmetrical - maybe it was an aesthetic
    decision in case of use at large sizes? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: '&#34;photo had so much gain&#34; <BR> <BR>Was this prepress gain caused by
    refraction of light? I&#39;d read this somewhere.  <BR> <BR>Or are you thinking
    of gain of ink on newsprint stock when printed offset? Or is it just accumulated
    ink gain on smaller text sizes? <BR> <BR>Those little nicks on the 4 look like
    the nicks occasionally encountered on foundry type. How would these work in photofilm
    technology? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t quite have my little duckies in a row yet in
    regard to the variances of trapping!!!'

  body: One more question. On Carter&#39;s Centennial&#40;sp?&#41; Bell I note that
    the very bold version reads as almost &#34;normal&#34; when printed digitally
    at its correct &#40;very small&#41; size. In this case, the trapping would be
    for visual correction rather than gain, right?

  body: I think the severe gain in photo was simply a result of imprecise focus, but
    I could be wrong. <BR> <BR>But gain really happens any time ink hits trees. <BR>
    <BR>Only the best printing from offset can avoid &#34;mechanical&#34; gain - but
    even then letterforms are subject to optical effects &#40;that trapping can help
    alleviate&#41;. <BR> <BR>My feeling is that the depth of a trap depends on many
    factors, but the shape of a trap in any technology is optimally the inverse of
    a circle - although aesthetics &#40;in case it&#39;s printed large&#41; makes
    itself felt too. <BR> <BR>Centennials Bold would have to be printed &#42;very&#42;
    small for those monster traps to be purely optical - my feeling is they&#39;re
    mostly to fight mechanical gain- remember that it was designed for printing on
    crappy phone-book paper. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant, I found very interesting your web place, specially the research and
    the non latin sections.  <BR> <BR>I see that you have achieved an easy and standarized
    method for trapping corners using the trapping flower. If it

    <BR> <BR>The parameters of the Flower depend on many things, including personal
    taste and technical issues &#40;like how bad the paper is&#41;. The Aperture ring
    and the Multiplier depend on how big you want the traps. The Minimum ring &#40;or
    actually its relation to the Aperture ring&#41; is determined by: how &#34;trap-heavy&#34;
    you want your font to be; and how much work you want to do! <BR> <BR>Determining
    the parameters is really trial and error, but the method provides for a lot of
    flexibility &#40;incliding some things that I haven&#39;t shown on that page&#41;,
    and with the right settings can reproduce even the trapping on Bell Centennial
    to within ~90%, with no imprecise and slow &#34;creative&#34; decisions necessary
    - trapping is one of the few things in type design that can be automated like
    this, so why not take advantage! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Sounds good, once the flower is calibrated, you get precise regularity on
    the trapping.  <BR> <BR>I guess you have to find the way to make some printing
    tests and corrections before releasing the work.
