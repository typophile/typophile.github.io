body: 'hi. <BR>i&#39;ve been ask to design a bitmap font for a unik device. the problem
  is that each pixel in that device is not exactly the size of a regular computer-screen
  pixel: each pixel is 0.33mm, and there should be a 0.03mm spacing between each pixel!
  i find this quite weird, because a regular pixel size is 0.36 mm. is that even possible
  to generate this kind of font? <BR> <BR>thanks'

    vary in different ways, like: <BR>- Be formed of non-square pixels &#40;even triangles
    and such&#41;. <BR>- Have gaps between pixels. <BR>- Use grays instead of just
    b&amp;w. <BR> <BR>In your case the gap is probably something inherent to the device,
    an area you can neither turn on or off. Probably you just need to design a regular
    bitmap font, and the gaps will just happen anyway. Because otherwise the device
    would need 12 times more resolution &#40;to allow you to address the gap&#41;.
