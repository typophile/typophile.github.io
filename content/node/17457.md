  body: "The typeface used was an old one (1910s?) called Artcraft. It is beautiful,
    isn't it?\r\n\r\nThe original had an open counter in the 'a', unlike your sample.
    The two digital versions that I can show you have this open 'a'. They are <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/artcraft/\"
    target=\"_blank\">URW's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.exuberance.com/type/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt
    Jalbert's</a> shareware version.\r\n\r\nTwo fonts that I cannot show you (and
    I've never seen them) are one by Alan Prescott for Compugraphic - which doesn't
    seem to be available anywhere today - and the Opti version.\r\n\r\nA couple of
    relevant posts on the MyFonts ID forum in recent months have indicated that the
    Opti font had your closed 'a' and that seems to be the most likely candidate.
    The only source for Opti fonts these days is <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Castcraft</a>."
