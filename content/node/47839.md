  this forum. I love what you guys do here, so I'm coming to you with my dilemma.
  I'm having a bit of difficulty with a logo I am creating. It is a personal project
  of mine, and I am having trouble with font weights.\r\n\r\nI am a college student,
  and I am starting my own personal online portfolio. I do a bit of freelance work,
  and I would like to get my name out there. These are the first drafts of my logo,
  and this was one direction I was considering going in.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wonderpixel_3453.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  a bit fond of the squares, but for some reason they look awkward to me. However,
  I am in love with the font (Gotham).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also played with the idea
  of using a 'super-hero' looking logo with a shield and a big bold 'W' with the url
  of my website-to-be underneath as a tagline. I don't see this done very often, and
  it might be a fun idea to play around with.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

    that I do graphic design work (Mostly advertising, and I work on my college's
    magazine and newsletter). I also do a bit of website design, specializing in interactive
    flash layouts. I don't do a whole lot of branding or work with logo design/illustration,
    but that is the direction that I would eventually like to go in.\r\n\r\nI'm a
    Sophomore in college (going for a degree in Graphic Design) and I'm taking typography,
    digital web design and mass media production in the fall semester, so hopefully
    I'll get some good experience then.\r\n\r\nHopefully this information will make
    it easier to critique my design"

  body: "\"wonderpixel\" is a great name: super fun and interesting.\r\n\r\nRight
    now, I think that the mark is too small and does not balance well with your type.
    \ Also, your kerning is all over the place, although maybe you just quickly posted
    these mock-ups to give up some idea of your direction.\r\n\r\nI think overall
    it's a bit static, and doesn't evoke enough of a sense of \"wonder\" or \"pixel.\"
    \ The colors are nice, though.\r\n\r\nA few questions:\r\n\r\nWhat does it look
    like in black and white?\r\nDid you start with pencil and paper?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

  body: "Yes, that was done fairly quickly. I wasn't paying much attention to size
    or kerning, more to the effects of different weights. I actually did start out
    on paper. It's pretty messy, I did it with a purple marker.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wp_5450.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    also shows some ideas with the 'Superhero' look. I think I might explore that
    a little."

  body: "I always love to see sketches on paper.\r\nIf I may comment on your sketches
    first?\r\n\r\n1. Use normal sketching paper with no lines on it.\r\n2. Don't crowd
    your sketches. Leave space around them. That way you can better judge them.\r\n\r\nFrom
    here I feel you are a bit 'afraid' of sketching.\r\nIf these are all of your sketches,
    you have started to soon behind the computer.\r\nYou didn't explore all you could.
    \r\nForce yourself to make more sketches. When you think you are ready to jump
    to the computer. DON'T. Put it asside and look at it the next day and continue
    sketching.\r\n\r\nAbout your post.\r\nFirst, you are not sure on the different
    weights.(I do agree about the kerning)\r\nLooking trough my brows (put aside the
    'pixels' in front of it) I can see that the bottom two are not in balance. 'Wonder'
    is too heavy in both of them. If that is what your intention was ... well done.
    If not. Too heavy.\r\n\r\nThe first one tickels me the most. It has a modern,
    webby feel to it. Nothing fancy though. \r\n\r\nI was wondering what happens if
    you place either of them in small caps?\r\n\r\nAbout the pixel-logo.\r\nLike I
    mentioned before. You started to soon behind the computer. There is more potential
    in this name. \r\nI think you didn't find it and perhaps you feel it too and that
    is why it doesn't feel that right to you.\r\n\r\nMy advice: don't concentrate
    on the type yet. First make sure you have a solid concept and go further with
    that. I'm sure you will come up with something better!\r\n\r\nPersonaly I like
    the colors.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nSorry for my long post.\r\n\r\nUugh.\r\n\r\nRay"

  body: "Thanks for all the feedback bobby, and you're right. I'm not super comfortable
    with sketching, as I often do preliminaries on the computer. I was also wary about
    the heavier weights of the bottom few, but the bottom one and the first one ended
    up being my favorites. I like the contrast in the first, and the fifth feels the
    most lively. I still haven't decided between them, but I most definitely think
    that I want to make 'wonder' as prominent (or moreso) than 'pixel', as wonder
    is a much more emphatic and memorable word.\r\n\r\nI did a few more mock-ups,
    but I think I will go pack to pen-and-paper and try to clean up and refine a few
    sketches.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wp02_3756.png]\r\n\r\nI
    was also considering the word pixel in a pixel-esque font. Yay or nay?"

  body: "Alright guys, I have a few more pen and paper sketches for you to look at.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wp04_4066.png]\r\n\r\nIt
    scanned in very badly, so I'll try and explain a few ideas so that they make more
    sense.\r\n\r\nNumber one is just wonderpixel in black with 'pixels' as embellishments
    on the front and back.\r\nNumber two is a just a hand-drawn version using black
    and green.\r\nNumber three is an idea to put different shades of 'pixels' together
    to spell the word pixel.\r\nNumber four is wonderpixel with a question mark in
    the o. I also considered putting it at the end. This is to stand for curiosity
    or wonderment, both synonyms of the word wonder.\r\nAnd number five is wonderpixel
    with a magic wand replacing the i.\r\n\r\nOn the right side are sketches of marks,
    but I am really thinking that most of the marks just clutter it. The ideas I am
    fondest of are 3 and 4, and I really don't think the magic wand is working, but
    I am excited to hear your ideas on how to expand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed
    that a synonym of wonder is puzzle. Not the noun form, but I'm thinking maybe
    puzzle pieces instead of 'pixels'. Though, I'm not sure if it would be the best
    solution."

    something pixelated could be the right way. It also adds to 'wonder'.\r\n\r\nBut
    I think it comes down to choosing the right font.\r\n\r\nYou said that wonder
    is synonym for puzzle, perhaps you can incorporate this into the lay-out of the
    logo?\r\nI think if you choose for number three, no additional logo is needed.\r\nIt
    speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nGood work!\r\n\r\nRay\r\n"

  body: hi, "wonderpixel" is a nice name. Personally I would concentrate on the "wonder"
    not on the "pixel" (overused). I like your sparkling idea. I think the wand is
    not necessary - what about havong a spark cloud and the sparks are squares (=pixel)?

  body: "Here's a suggestion (and like all free advice, take it for what it's worth).
    \ I like number 3, although instead of pixelating \"pixel,\" what if you had the
    word \"wonder\" plixelated, and then moving from left to right, you would remove
    pixels here and there, removing more as you moved right.  It would give the sense
    of the word falling apart and dissolving, which would give suggest the relationship
    between abstract and concrete.  Then put \"pixel\" underneath \"wonder\" in solid
    type to give a sense of grounding and conceptual contrast.  \r\n\r\n--\r\nNick
