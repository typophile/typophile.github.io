  have outlined the type and made sure they were within the trim marks.  why do you
  think it might still have the exclamation marks? \r\n\r\nin QuickCut,it also has
  a particular section needing print marks.  i have specified these marks in Indesign???
  \r\n\r\nin QuickCut, ink weight: it says that 63.37% of an image exceeds 310%.  i
  have attemped to change the size of the photoshop file, by experimenting with tif
  files and jpg files and still this appears???\r\n\r\nin QuickCut, knock out black:
  it locates the section which needs to have the knock out black removed.  i went
  to the particular file and unchecked the knock out, and still the problem is there!!"
