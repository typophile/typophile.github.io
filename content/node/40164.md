  body: "I've only had the book since yesterday, so I haven't read the whole thing.
    But, from what I have read and looked at, it appears to be very thorough and lucid.
    The writing style is engaging with a bit of subtle humor (even sarcasm at times),
    which can be illuminating in its own way.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted me to this book
    is the way it gathers a huge amount of information into one place. Sure, you can
    find all of it (and more) on, for example, Microsoft's, Apple's, and Adobe's websites,
    but it's nice to have it summed up in one book, and from a (presumably) more objective
    observer. And if you do need further information, links are included to the relevant
    documents on the Web.\r\n\r\nWhat other books are comparable?"

  body: "I can't say how the French edition is, but the English edition is just riddled
    with errors. Most are typos and the like, but some of the errors are pretty serious.
    For example, in the introduction it claims that the standard em square is 1024
    x 1024 for PostScript fonts, and 4096 x 4096 for TrueType fonts. Of course, the
    correct values are 1000 x 1000 and 2048 x 2048 - and that difference between 1000
    and 1024 is important, because it means that the TrueType norm is not a simply
    multiple of the Type 1 (\"PostScript\") norm.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame, because it
    is a wonderfully ambitious book and covers an amazing amount of ground. A second
    edition that corrected the errors could be a truly great book.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT "
