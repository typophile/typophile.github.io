  Civil War era. I came across Morris Fuller Benton's Wedding of 1901 with indications
  it was designed based on earlier Victorian styles but am not sure if it reflects
  a style in use in the USA --or if there is really any difference between styles
  used in the USA or elsewhere. I know there are some Old English styles available,
  but again, is there a difference between US and other styles? I will be using the
  letter style to do a carved inscription. \r\n\r\nAny and all thoughts and opinions
  are welcome! Thank you in advance."

  body: "Noting your reference to M.F. Benton's Wedding Text I gather that your reference
    to \"blackletter\" means typeface in the style of Old English, textura, fraktur,
    etc rather than any dark letter, such as a very thick sans. You have some good
    choices in this category.\r\nThe best assortment of such fonts from the American
    Civil War era -- taken broadly as the 1850s to 1870s-- is by Michael Hagemann
    at FontMesa.\r\nThe one I like best as a textura is Black Pearl http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/black-pearl/
    a revival of an 1868 design by West for the Farmer Foundry. You can simplify it
    by not including the swirls and it could look really effective when carved. In
    my opinion it looks like vigorous version of the design ideas found in Friedrich
    Bauer's Fette Gotisch of 1875 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fette-gotisch/.\r\nAnother
    good choice is Black Rose http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/black-rose/ a
    revival of the Bruce Type Foundry font called \u201CBlack Ornamented\u201D created
    in 1873. A few years after the American Civil War, but I believe it really catches
    the spirit of the era. \r\nYet another with really good potential for carving
    once the ornamentation is discarded is Silverland a revival of a Bruce Type Foundry
    numbered font created in 1874, with an added lower case. Again, a few years after
    the American Civil War, but it too catches the spirit of the era. The basic letterforms
    are well proportioned and would work well in an inscription.\r\nMore from Michael

  body: "Hi Nick, thanks for mentioning your Boston Blackie. This got me thinking
    about very dark & wide blackletters and I remembered Caslon Black, which was definitely
    in use during the Civil War. There is a digital version, as Avebury Black by Jim
    Parkinson, modified to some extent based by a Bruce version http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/avebury/
    Either font would work well in a carved inscription and would give it a very solid
    character.\r\nDon"

  body: "Everyone's comments are greatly appreciated! \r\n\r\nI'll have to do some
    figuring on the heft of the text to ensure there is enough thickness of work to
    support it. Light (actually darkness) gives the carved letters dimension. To create
    the darkness, carvings are often done with about a 60 degree cut angle. The wider
    the lettering,  the deeper the cut in the work. For this reason I may have to
    lean toward some of the lighter text weights suggested. \r\n\r\nAgain, everyone's
    freely offered help and expertise is truly appreciated. Now to choosing..."
