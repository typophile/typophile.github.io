body: I&#39;ve been asked to try to get some quick information for a product and not
  spend any money &#40;yet&#41; doing so... <BR> <BR>Generically speaking, what I&#39;m
  trying to determine is what rings we&#39;ll need to hop through to produce a three-dimensional
  product using a font.  The kicker, is that we&#39;ll need to use the name of the
  font &#40;ie Trade Gothic&#41;.  So, I&#39;m guessing that we&#39;ll need to obtain
  a special licensing deal for use of font...because of the identification. <BR> <BR>Or,
  not?  With the license of our existing fonts are we already covered?  We&#39;ve
  bought many fonts in the past &#40;but who saves the TOS&#41; so...this is where
  I&#39;m fuzzy. <BR> <BR>Anyways, before we have to get attorneys involved and such
  I&#39;m hoping that somebody might have some insight even with my lack of very clear
  product information &#40;just try to take it as I explained it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks,

  body: My take on licenses is that I only buy fonts which licenses aren&#39;t stuck
    in the 1980&#39;s. But on the other hand I&#39;m using those for my own stuff
    sometimes. I&#39;m not sure if this helps or not. <BR> <BR>If the font is used
    in a game for a gaming console you don&#39;t need to fear that someone cracks
    the code and pulls out the font for desktop use. Even on a Mac or Windows game
    the fonts are usually put in hard to convert formats that render the font unusable
    for desktop use. <BR> <BR>In a font license the part of the font embedding would
    affect you I think. That quite fits what you do, embed the whole font in a product
    that uses it, but the font can&#39;t be pulled out of it again. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    hard to guess, as a lot of foundries are still fast asleep when it comes to solutions
    for modern media. <BR> <BR>FJ

  body: I think you could consider it embedding if a rather common technique is used
    where a font file is <i>embedded</i> into the application. The 3D engine then
    either renders it in 2D as a texture or creates geometry from its outlines in
    &#40;semi&#41;real-time. <BR> <BR>I agree with Si that a custom license would
    be the safest way in any case. Not necessarily the more costly even.  <BR> <BR>FJ

  body: v, it might be helpful if you could clarify what you mean by &#34;three-dimensional
    product.&#34;  <BR> <BR>When I first read it, I assumed you meant something like
    letters cast in metal. In other words, physical objects, like House Industries&#39;
    Neutraface house numbers.  <BR> <BR>When Frank started talking about 3d digital
    rendering in some sort of software product, I realized that that could well be
    what you mean.  <BR> <BR>Either interpretation seems possible from your description,
    but they are entirely different things when it comes to licensing issues.

  body: Sorry...3D = physical object.  Something you put in your hands. <BR> <BR>We
    did make a fast decision to push this into the prototype phase and when it&#39;s
    produced we will get legal and financial teams to work on it - it gets killed
    here that&#39;s what happens. <BR> <BR>Even if it ends up simply being an in-house
    thing it&#39;s something we want.

  body: V. Depending upon the font which you are using to create your 3D object, I
    would recommend you contact the foundry. Some foundries won&#39;t mind and will
    not see what you have done as against their EULA, but some foundries will see
    it exactly opposite. Those foundries will view what you&#39;ve created as dependent
    upon their typeface and will require additional licensing fees. I would guess
    that these foundries will be more likely to be generous if you contact them now,
    before you&#39;ve created the product.  <BR> <BR>My suggestions
