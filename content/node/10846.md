  body: Nope. But now I&#39;m gonna have that song stuck in my head all day. <BR>
    <BR>Also, I&#39;m a lazy bollocks and failed to check the site of this foundry,
    which has changed since I was there last. So...here&#39;s a different image from
    the same font. You&#39;ll see why this is necessary when you find it. If someone
    happens by this post, could you delete my previous one to avoid confusion. And
    to make me look less like an idiot :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks and all. <BR> <BR><img

    <BR>that was pulled because the creator of Bellevue &#40;sp.&#41; objected.  <BR>There
    was an interview with him online <BR>but I don&#39;t see it anymore. <BR> <BR><a

    trying to come up with a hint that won&#39;t &#40;1&#41; entirely give this away

  body: OK, here&#39;s my hint. Hopefully this is all it takes - and my apologies
    for being so obtuse. Unfortunately, I think this is going to sound like a wild
    goose chase. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a band from Atlanta, Georgia called Hal al Shedad.
    If you find their last recording, the record label it&#39;s on should point you
    toward the right foundry. So we&#39;ve now gone from the Midwest, up North, and
    now we&#39;re in the deep South. Stupid, eh.
