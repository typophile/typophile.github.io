  running OS X. In Fog4, when you&#39;re flipping through glyphs, the left side-bearing
  stays put. This is a good way of judging the relative positions of different characters
  without drawing a bunch of guides. <BR> <BR>In FL3, and again in FL4, I flip through
  the glyphs, and each glyph gets centered in the glyph window. This is good/bad.
  However, I&#39;ve noticed that &#42;sometimes&#42; the left side-bearing does stay
  put between glyphs! I noticed that there is a tiny lock icon in the ruler at the
  top of the side-bearings and at the end of the baseline. Does this have something
  to do with it? <BR> <BR>I emailed Pyrus, haven&#39;t gotten an answer yet. I know,
  I know, rtfm. I did &#40;skimmed really fast looking for screenshots of that little
  lock&#41;. Anyone have any ideas? &#40;now preparing to feel really stupid&#41; '

    know where I&#39;m located? <BR> <BR>I pay attention. <BR>As John Cleese&#39;s
    barrister character would have inquisited: &#34;You &#42;do&#42; work for MvB
    Design, is that correct?&#34; <BR> <BR>BTW, by some coincidence &#40;this being
    your first &#91;independently verifiable&#93; public post that I personally remember&#41;
    just yesterday I got the 5th issue of that m.real magazine&#42;, and for the first
    time saw your Atma in &#91;print&#93; action: pretty elegant, but not overly cold
    &#40;just the descenders I find a bit too long - a problem for economy&#41;. I
    especially like the fact that you&#39;re included &#34;hybrid&#34; figures and
    multiple sizes of caps &#40;except maybe 3 sizes is enough - few people even notice
    this stuff anyway&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.m-real.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.m-real.com/</A>
    <BR>  It&#39;s square &#40;which is nice&#41;, and printed on too-fancy paper
    &#40;not nice&#41;, and the previous issue was called &#34;Black and White&#34;
    - right up my alley. The current issue is all color photos - deathly boring. <BR>
