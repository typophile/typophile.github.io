    the very first Design Patent for type, number D1 issued in 1842 to George Bruce,
    consisted of 666 words. \r\n\r\nIt's written at the end of the patent, I guess
    because people who wrote such things got paid by the word in those days."

      more PCC streetcars, trams in Europe, than any other US city....They ordered
      666 to be exact :) :)

    body: I am referring to the ones that came later....Pgh bought the first PCC ever
      sold...(was going to go to Baltimore but it ended up in Pgh). the PCCs that
      went to drake are no longer running...The Overbrook track from South Hills Jnct
      to Castle Shannon were so bad they had to be closed, so they ran a Drake Shuttle
      with PCCs from Castle Shannon to Drake, but hardly anyone rode it since they
      did not want to transfer at Castle Shanon...so the PCC Drake Shuttle closed
      in 1999....When they redid the Overbrook section and reopened it, the Drake
      line from the spur to South Hills to Drake never re-opened...I doubt it ever
      will...they have been waiting for "funding" to redo that line forever, doubt
      it will ever happen...PAT Transit is hurting bad, they just stopped the little
      used tunnel bypass line that went through Allentown....All weekend LRV service
      on the Library line will end in September also. Will only run weekdays....As
      a kid I visited my Grandma in Wilkins burgh each summer and rode the PCC trolleys
      on the east End of Pgh....they were taken away January, 1967. End of Pittsburgh
      trolley update LOL

  body: "True, Hrant.\r\n\r\nLucifer in \"Christian Satanism\", if you can call it
    that, is all tied up in Christian symbols by definition.  It uses the same \"branding\"
    as the church and turns it on its ear. Upside down crosses and all that.\r\n\r\nThe
    typical portrayal of the devil is just comical, and as many actors have pointed
    out, the bad guy is just a more interesting role to play. In the same spirit,
    I think is the common association of blackletter with things satanical by metal
    bands, tattoo parlors etc.\r\n\r\nReal evil is banal - More like Helvetica or
    Arial. Guaranteed, a contract with the devil these days would be set in either
    of those two fonts, depending on what OS the devil favours.\r\n\r\n:o)\r\n\r\n"
