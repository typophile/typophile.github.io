body: "I would like to recreate this 1940-era design, but would like to use the original
  fonts if possible. I think it is practical to structure this post using the FAQ
  available on this board.\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I help with the identification of my
  sample?\r\nAs a matter of fact yes. Tell us whatever you know about your sample
  that might be useful. Information such as the country and age of the sample, and
  whether it is from a web site, or from a scan of printed material. (For example,
  if we know something comes from an advertisement published in the 50\u2019s it rules
  out a lot of possibilities.)</strong>\r\nThe sample is printed for the Dutch and/or
  Belgian market, considering the spelling of the months. It is not sure if it was
  actually printed in Holland or Belgium, as it could have been imported from a foreign
  source. The font was designed in 1942 or before. I think there are actually two
  fonts, one being sans-serif (the months), the other is a serif font (used for the
  days and the title: 'Kalender 1942').\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I have a go at it myself?</strong>\r\nIdentifont:
  resulted in a font from 1965. I cannot rule out that I have given a wrong answer
  on any of the questions as I am not experienced in typography.\r\n\r\nMyFonts\u2019
  WhatTheFont?!: I got 8 results but the were all negatives and did not resemble the
  sample.\r\n\r\nFurthermore MyFonts\u2019 keyword search: Waters Titling proved a
  close match, that is however a contemporary design.\r\n\r\nMike Yanega\u2019s Script
  Font Identification Guide: I suppose it would be a Formal Non-flowing Script, but
  I could not identify the font I am searching for on his site.\r\n\r\nFontShop\u2019s
  TypeNavigator: It resulted in Bitstream Carmina Light by Gudrun Zapf von Hesse (1987).
  However that font is contemporary and notably different from the font I am searching
  for. However, as with Identifont, I cannot rule out that I have selected a wrong
  option.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kalender_3560.png]"

  body: The serif font looks like something by DeRoos, such as Hollandse Mediaeval
    or Zilvertype, but it doesn't quite match. Canada Type's <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/dutch-mediaeval/">Dutch
    Mediaeval</a> is a revival of Hollandse Mediaeval.

    research you are willing to do on my behalf.  \r\n\r\nI regret not having more
    samples of said font available, but I am particularly fond of the suggestions
    which, in my opinion, capture the design of the era quite well...\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: You've captured it amazingly well, considering you're using Office. You could
    get a lot closer using a graphics program, such as Illustrator, InDesign or QuarkXPress.
    But if you're satisfied with this, I wouldn't bother. I would maybe make the month
    names a little less tightly spaced.

  body: "I will look into acquiring a graphics program, perhaps Illustrator. Thank
    you for your remark regarding the month names, I suppose the design is a bit off
    in that respect. I supposed that using Futura Bold instead of Futura Lt BT would
    yield better results but in the end Futura Lt BT proved better suitable.\r\n\r\nAnother
    factor, which was pointed out by mr. Yanega, is that the font used in the original
    is a metal typeface. I suppose that accounts for some of the differences which
    were noticed by more experienced members of this forum. It also proved to be difficult
    to maintain the same scale.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, using formulas in Excel
    considerably eased the amount of work required, which is a significant benefit
    of using Office in this case."

  body: Xcel is very good for making up tables like this, but has a limited degree
    of control over format compared to a graphics program. In a program like Illustrator,
    the degree to which you could match the spacing and arrangement of the type and
    other elements would only be limited by your ability to measure and observe. Even
    the smudgy ink effects could be simulated with filters. Of course, it depends
    on what you're using it for. None of that may matter for your purposes.
