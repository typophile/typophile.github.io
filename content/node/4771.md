  car spare parts company - Canley &#40;or Canley Classics - yet to be decided&#41;
  - also does servicing and work on cars too. They&#39;re alot more than just that
  though - they invest a lot of money in my favourite marque of car &#40;Triumph&#41;
  - developing various products and making new parts. There is a really big feel good
  factor about buying from them - they are one of the few good guys - everywhere seems
  rather money grabbing. Passionate is the word. <BR> <BR> <BR>A few of their competitors

  alt="JP"> <BR> <BR> <BR>The trouble I&#39;ve got is that I the people who are going
  to appreciate the logo perhaps arent exactly type or design orientated - which I
  know is normal for most jobs - but Im having a real problem trying to &#34;place&#34;
  the logo and being happy with it. <BR> <BR>I almost need to walk away from this
  job and come back - but I don&#39;t have time. I need some fresh thinking. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;ve been looking at typefaces - and with lots I think &#34;that would look
  really nice and would give the right feel&#34; - but I then get paranoid thinking
  that the type isnt going to be suitable - but whats suitable anyway? There are no
  set rules with what Im working with - and I don&#39;t have much to compare with
  in their market place - as most of them either arent really &#34;designed&#34; or
  are just really after thoughts... <BR> <BR>Ramble over... confused... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
  ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I thought this would be fun - working with something
  I love - but perhaps Im just too close to it... strange... <BR> <BR>How do you guys
  cope with this? Any advice? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>James <BR>'

    are the people you must reach! They may not be type oriented, but they are certainly
    Triumph oriented, yes? The trouble &#40;opportunity&#41; with the competion is
    that as far as I can tell their look does not connect with Triumph in any way.
    Before thinking about typeface, think about how you can make your product the
    &#42;authentic&#42; spirit of the original, not the flashy tripple gradient Rimmer
    Bros. <BR> <BR>Make the connection your goal. For example, I bet if you included
    a very &#40;i mean very&#41; subtle leaf cluster motif, a true enthusiast would
    instantly recognize it. That&#39;s probably not the answer, but seek out that
    swap-meet junkie appeal. Flip though old brochures, catalogues, ads, car club
    newsletters, racing ephemera etc. <BR> <BR>As for font, don&#39;t let this drive
    your concept. It may be a type-only solution in the end, but is it based on the
    chrome lettering from the 1956.... blah blah. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: 'Thanks for the advice Randy. Feel a bit silly now... the trouble is the people
    Im trying to reach I know too well &#40;does that make sense?&#41; and I&#39;m
    one of them... so what seems easy is actually a bit difficult... am I making sense?
    <BR> <BR>Im trying to get it as authentic - and thats what I&#39;ve been looking
    at - mainly 60s/70s typefaces - old logos of that period. <BR> <BR>I have two
    things to do: a logo for them - which I think will be mainly type based - and
    also a &#34;competition logo&#34; which will be for their &#34;go-faster&#34;
    race products they do - and will be cast on to products - and also be on the racing
    cars they sponsor... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/35910.jpg"
    alt="canleygogo"> <BR> <BR>&#40;a very rough!&#41; <BR> <BR>Currently working
    around the original Triumph logo - and making it look a bit more up to date and
    motorsport-alike... <BR> <BR>The original design: <BR> <BR><a href="http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&amp;query_id=5479176&amp;page=1&amp;brand_id=3449"
    target="_blank">http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&amp;query_id=5479176&amp;page=1&amp;brand_id=3449</a>
    <BR> <BR>...is actually based on a pair of wings... so thats what Im working on...

    type one too... still finding the right typeface for it... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/36162.gif"
    alt="canleyruff"> <BR> <BR> <BR>Ignore the tag line - I just put it in there to
    see what it came out like... <BR> <BR>I think I might try putting some wings on
    the two C&#39;s next... <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>James <BR>

    cars as sleek and angluar.
