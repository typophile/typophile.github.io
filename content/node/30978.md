  body: So did you open a Didot typeface in FontLab and take off the serifs? Because
    I think that the specific EULA (End-User License Agreement) for that Didot will
    govern whether you can use this personally. I'd really doubt that any EULA would
    let you modify a font and then sell it commercially. But if you made this from
    scratch (not by opening up a Didot font) <em>based</em> on Didot, then that should
    be perfectly fine for personal or commercial use.

  body: Even for personal use you could be stepping on someone's toes. Some people
    will say you shouldn't worry about it, but if you respect the type designer and
    his work perhaps you will keep this in your box of tricks and only use it for
    a logo or something. If this is Hoefler's Didot I'm pretty sure you aren't supposed
    to be reverse engineering it. However, I do think it is kosher to use in Illustrator
    for logos and such.

  body: Sandro, I meant that you could digitize Didot based on an old printed specimen,
    which is where all the current Didots began -- to my knowledge, to base it off
    a printed version and then modify it to suit your needs should be perectly fine.
    As Miss Tiffany said, the key is to respect the type designers.

  body: "I do not believe that there are any Didot family sketches of letters to find.
    But you could find very old books printed with types cut by the Didot family.
    These would probably all be in French. Aside from France, tehre may be copies
    of some of these works in rare books libraries. I suggest contacting the nearest
    rare books libraries in your area. Some large University libraries collect rare
    books.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you could look at old printer specimen books, like ATF
    catalogs, old Monotype or Linotype catalogs, etc., and try to get a feel from
    those how [[Didone]]-style letters looked in various point sizes. Maybe some of
    the Photo Lettering Inc. catalogs could help?\r\n\r\nLastly, quite a lot of gravestones
    and engravings and other prints from the first half of the 19th century were made
    using vaguely Didone letters. You could look at these for visual reference as
    well."
