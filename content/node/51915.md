  as they come up? And by very I mean within minutes. I am just switching to ID CS3
  from Quark in the middle of a job and am under pressure of time so I don't have
  the luxury of figuring it out myself the old fashioned way and I am finding the
  built in help surprisingly unhelpful.\r\n\r\nI don't want to bother typophiles with
  tech questions but if this can be my help line, fantastic. I can use this thread
  as a record of my questions and answers.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, I am trying to re-build
  my style-sheets. So far so good, but for some reason it won't let me assign a keyboard
  shortcut. The field is highlighted, but no matter what I type, it stays blank.\r\n\r\n?"

  body: I wonder if you're trying to use a shortcut that's already in use by default.
    I usually use the command (+ shift) + number system for styles and haven't had
    any problems.

  body: "<cite>I <strong>usually</strong> use the command (+ shift) + number [..]</cite>\r\n\r\nChristopher,\r\n\r\nThe
    \"number\" there should be one of the Numeric keypad numbers -- and with Num Lock
    On (or Off -- I can never remember which one, but it makes a difference). You
    can use it with any combination of Shift, Control, Alt, and Command (if you have
    that key).\r\n\r\nIt's the <em>only</em> key combo that ID allows to be used directly
    for Paragraph and Character styles (and object styles as well).\r\n\r\nIf you
    really, really want to use other keys, check the InDesign User to User forums
    (what Miss Tiff suggested), because you can set any hotkey for a script, and you
    can easily write a single line script that applies a single style (and that's
    already Advanced Stuff).\r\n\r\n<cite> I am finding the built in help surprisingly
    unhelpful ...</cite>\r\n\r\nYe-e-e-s, that has been mentioned in the User forums
    more than once..."
