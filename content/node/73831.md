  is and I've searched all my resources to no avail.\r\n\r\nThe closest I can find
  is Centaur, but this font has double serifs on many upper case letters; that is
  the serifs extend ABOVE the horizontal stroke of the capital T as well as below
  it, and on the S and E the serifs extend to both sides of the horizontals, extending
  above the top line. The upper case J is similar to Centaur's, extending below the
  line and pointing downward.\r\n\r\nHe believes this was a font that came with some
  Microsoft product (Word, Office) about 7 years ago. I've searched MS's current Office
  fonts and not found a match.\r\n\r\nThank you!!!!\r\n\r\nStacey"
