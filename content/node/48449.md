  body: "It isnt an exact match, but <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine/nicotine/\">Nicotine</a>
    comes close.  I have a feeling that the lowercase glyphs in the background are
    from the same face, but I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nLike I said, that one is close,
    but there are differences."

    Agency Black]], which would just need the R closed to be very similar indeed.\r\n\r\n-
