  very constructive and critical feedback. I am very new to Glyphs and that is what
  I used to build this out (see the below to get all intimate with my nodes). Please
  let me know what you think! Where I can improve it, and other thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: "Hey, this looks nice. My favorite thing is how well you've resolved the tittles
    of the \"i\"s. And I love how the shadow details are giving it a nice layered
    feel.\r\n\r\nSome things to consider:\r\n- The \"C\" is too narrow, and its bottom-left
    is malformed.\r\n- The \"s\" is too wide.\r\n- The terminals of the \"s\" seem
    out of character. I'm not sure teardrop terminals would work though. If they don't
    try making those serifs more one-sided.\r\n- The big swash on top is coming too
    close to the \"s\".\r\n- When strokes cross (like towards the bottom of the \"L\")
    they often don't end up <em>looking</em> like their two parts are lining up...
    To make it easier to tweak the \"apparent alignment\", give each crossing curve
    a two-node flat segment hidden inside the other crossing stroke.\r\n- The loop
    in the descender of the \"h\" is too square.\r\n- I think a monocameral \"a\"
    might work better.\r\n- The \"r\" looks like an \"i\" trying to lick the sky...
    Try to integrate the two parts better.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thank you much! Your comments are causing things to stand out that I missed
      completely before. Some  questions (some of this is fairly new to me)..\r\n\r\nS)
      I went back and forth on the terminal. Lacrimal terminals really weighed the
      composition down. It was just too same/same. CAn you clarify what you mean by
      \"one sided serifs\"? Maybe point me to some type that uses this on the s?\r\n\r\nA
      little lost on the following comment: \"When strokes cross (like towards the
      bottom of the \"L\") they often don't end up looking like their two parts are
      lining up... To make it easier to tweak the \"apparent alignment\", give each
      crossing curve a two-node flat segment hidden inside the other crossing stroke.\"\r\n\r\nThanks
      again for the feedback! I will refine this some more!\r\n\r\ncheers, evan"
