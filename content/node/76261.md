body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI want to be able to alter the wordspace in InDesign. I have been
  able to find a keyboard shortcut to be able to reduce and increase wordspace, but
  I would like to be able to access it over a menu, to enter an exact value. Is this
  possible? And is it possible to return to the original value as well?"

    Instead of 80%, 100%, 133% you could use 80%, 80%, 80%.
