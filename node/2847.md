  was looking for a good, historical font to use in my <i>Machiavelli</i> graphic

  just wanted to thank everyone for the help and ask if there are any glaring type-related
  issues that I missed. Thanks!'

  body: 'Looks very good.  <BR> <BR>I would just check the kerning where your regular
    caps meet the italic lower case. This is historically correct, but probably the
    typeface doesn&#39;t have kerning pairs for it. For example the T and r in &#39;Truly&#39;
    look too far apart to me. So you need to use your software kerning, or if you
    are using InDesign you can also use the &#39;optical kerning&#39; setting which
    might take care of the whole thing.  '

  body: I love Jenson, it&#39;s such a nice face.  I think I like it even better than
    Adobe Garamond... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always wondered, is it Mack-ee-ah-vel-ee or
    Ma-ch-ee&#40;eeah?&#41;-bel-ee?
