  body: "Honestly it's best to get a website because it's kind of a pain for people
    to download your pdf for viewing especially when there are several applicants.
    It also clogs up their inboxes and makes it hard to share your work around the
    office.\r\n\r\nThere are some sites that you can upload your work to like portfolios.com
    or foliolink.com.\r\n\r\nWhat you send should be examples of your best work that
    show your strongest skills as a designer."

  body: "Consider what kind of work the studio specializes in. Obviously, you'll want
    to showcase any online skills you have for an employer that does a lot of web
    work.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm looking for magazine designers, I prefer a PDF for the very
    reasons Haley cites in support of online portfolios: easy to share via e-mail
    (or place in a \"candidates to consider\" folder on our server), easy to zoom
    in to see detail, easy to look under the hood to see what type was used... ;)"

    use the format. Just buy a domain and some server space, and you can plug in your
    images. Make sure to follow the instructions on the site very carefully, though,
    if you do decide to go this route.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what you should show, 10
    pieces is plenty. If you don't have 10 strong pieces, show 5, or 6, or however
    many you think can stand on their own outside the context of your portfolio. "

  body: "I rarely find anyone accepting unsolicited PDF portfolios from prospective
    interns; most people don\u2019t want their emails getting jammed up with gigantic
    files from clueless students who output everything from Indesign as a \u201CHigh-Quality
    Print\u201D PDF and so all PDFs are ignored as a matter of priciple. If a design
    firm is requesting PDF files, try to get it under 500kb before emailing; you can
    always post a hi-res version online somewhere and email a link along with your
    small PDF. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s much better to have a web site that people can just
    browse, and you can post any crazy files you want to on a web site linked from
    images. <a href=\"http://www.jpad.biz\">My horrid little web site has brought
    me three internships in as many years.</a> Indexhibit is nice, but if you\u2019re
    really desperate you can just tweak one of the Dreamweaver templates (most designers
    don\u2019t even look at them and won\u2019t recognize them).\r\n\r\nAs for the
    work, pick the best pieces you have, if you really don\u2019t have a clue what
    to pick ask your professors and fellow students. Keep in mind that when people
    say 10-12 pieces that means 10-12 (or whatever number) pages of stuff to look
    at, not 10-12 multi-page projects. If you talk a lot at job interviews put more
    stuff online and take less in person\u2014I run my mouth so much I\u2019m lucky
    to get through five boards before I\u2019m out of time. Lastly, go to any portfolio
    review days put on by local design organizations. Drag out every wild piece of
    crap you have; one good suggestion can take a real turd and turn it into a great
    showpiece."
