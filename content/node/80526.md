  am already using Ultramagnetic on the cover, table of contents, and for chapter
  titles. Any ideas for a lovely match? \r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "It's for a large international company. The cookbook is in conjunction with
    a diversity poster campaign in which employees submit recipes, and as I suggested,
    stories to accompany them. I chose ultramagnetic because it was friendly, but
    also because I am using stencils for the letters and pouring in spices. The ultra
    black, with its width and rounded corners made it a nice choice for this concept.
    I'm also using the ingredients of each persons recipe to illustrate their story
    by hand. I thought that the other weights would suffice for the book, but I need
    something more legible because these submissions could get lengthy.\r\n\r\nHere
    is an example of some of the work I've been doing by hand, which I didn't want
    to show because I'm not asking for a critique, but I guess if you all recoil at
    the thought of using this face for a cookbook maybe I should give it some context.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/diversity

  body: "I guess you're aware Ultramagnetic is a family member of Alternate Gothic
    (old Morris Benton Design).\r\n\r\nSo News Gothic, Franklin Gothic, Trade Gothic,
    Benton Sans -- all those classic American Grots are stylisitcally harmonious.\r\n\r\nFor
    a serif face, I'm thinking something with a \"press gain\" look, e.g. my <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/paradigm-pro/\">Paradigm
    Pro Light</a>.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of \"sturdy/dark\" text face recently published.
    \r\nDolly was one of the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI used a demonstration with
    salt in my type design class for several years: pour salt in letter shape, photograph,
    make high contrast in Photoshop, import into FontLab, autotrace, et voil\xE0,
    \"Blur\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For a similar/contrasting feel, maybe Slimbach (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/slimbach/alternate_cuts.html)
    or the more playful Arbiter (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/arbiter-bq/).\r\nOr,
    as Nick noted, something which can give a \"press gain\" feel, so no thin or sharp
    serifs, but something slabby and without too much contrast.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    I like the sample you posted :-) I asked about the type of cookbook just to better
    suggest something appropriate, given the peculiarity of Ultramagnetic in such
    context."
