  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone- A peecee user invading here with a Mac software question...

I am trying to modify a font (substitute two characters) and I am curious as to how to go about doing this in the most efficient manner possible... The font in question is a font that was created in /for Mac. I'm trying to alter this font for a professor whose collegues and herself only use Macs in order to be on the same page document wise as this is a differently charactered alphabet. 

Reading up on the Mac OS it looks like the Fontbook feature "automate" enables the /scanning in/ of fonts... is this true, does it work the way it sounds? (Scan in and assign each character to the map?)

Any help you can offer is greatly appreciated, don't assume that I know anything overly complicated as I'm a complete noob as far as font manipulation goes. The kicker is as well that I can't even open the font on the PC to attempt a unicode version or some other version that'll work with their Macs...

		<div class="commentbody">When Font Book "scans" a font, it is simply checking it over making sure its not corrupt and gathering information about the font so it's ready to install. The only thing it can do to a font is install it. You can't use it to reassign characters or anything like that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm a VERY novice user of TTX, but maybe it can be used to decompile a font, reassign a glyph or two, and recompile said font. (Assuming all of this taking-apart-and-putting-back-together isn't infringeing the font's license agreement.)

		<div class="commentbody">Glad it suits your purpose. My only caution would be that Mac font files go corrupt even easier in a PC file system - sometimes they will corrupt just from being left in the same place for too long (disk fragmenting? I dunno). So make <em>multiple</em> backups!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Two things:

Mac font suitcases use a file structure that is not recognized by Windows systems. Thus, if you copy a Mac font suitcase to a PC and back, part of the file may be lost in the transition, leaving you with a damaged (corrupt) font.

In the Mac OS before OS X, the font suitcases of active fonts were open for read/write all the time the system was running. If there was a crash, open documents could be corrupted. This was the most common cause of corrupt fonts. There may be other ways that fonts (or any other files) may become corrupted, but I have not seen this problem come up very often on OS X.</div>
