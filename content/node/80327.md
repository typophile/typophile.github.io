  for a school. In the past, we've always ordered enough diplomas for 10 years and
  it's time for a reorder. However the printer is no longer in business and the artwork
  is nowhere to be found. I'm trying to identify a font used on the diploma and am
  having no luck. Anyone able to help me? \r\nThanks!"

  body: 'Michael is right, compare the shading in repeating letters. I should have
    been more precise: if you want to recreate something similar <em>with fonts</em>,
    start with those mentioned above.'
