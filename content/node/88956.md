body: "We* use Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk as our house font for print, signage, etc.
  and Standard CT as a close approximation for Web Fonts. It's gotten a bit crazy
  how much time we have to spend kerning and tracking and pushing and pulling Akzidenz
  on a daily basis, especially as we continue to grow, add new designers, etc.\r\n\r\nWe've
  got the in-house skill and software to do a custom version that would address the
  kerning pairs, occasionally wonky tracking and some of the baffling character inconsistencies
  between weights. The time-savings and brand consistency we could get from an altered
  version is compelling. We would use it, but never sell it. \r\n\r\nMy question is,
  is this legal? \r\n\r\nIf not, how/who would we approach to get licensing to tackle
  this and how much would it hypothetically cost?\r\n\r\n*I'm the Design Director
  for an in-house team handling print and web collateral (7 designers and devs, ~200
  projects a month ranging from fliers and small print pieces to annual reports and
  a fairly expansive website). We're not huge, but we're not small, nor is the reach
  of our communications pieces, e.g. we're not exactly under the radar, and we always
  want to be above board legally in our dealings."

    They probably won\u2019t answer and you have a pretty solid agreement (even if

    I was under the impression that Adobe sells the\r\nBerthold fonts (at least the
    big-name ones), and you only have\r\nto respect the EULA of where you bought a
    font, but now that\r\nI checked, my memory was jogged: Berthold pulled their fonts\r\nfrom
    Adobe a while back.\r\n\r\nSo I think your best strategy would be to switch \r\nto
    an Akzidenz look-alike with a permissive EULA.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
