  body: "First one looks like giant teeth are biting into the text, and second has
    a road running through it. You had a version with just typographic \"bridges\"
    in the text. That worked better than these.\r\n\r\nTrajan is better; that lower
    one has some awkward glyphs, especially that e at the end."

    but it looks like that was a different student in the same class \u2014 judging
    by the URL, at BYU.\r\n\r\nNone of these are working yet. Don't get caught up
    in the details of rendering bridges. Get a solid concept first. Try working with
    the other part of the word: 'Mind'."
