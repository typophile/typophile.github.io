  I grew up in. I'm working on a couple other ideas but this is my favorite so far.
  I'm looking for a critique on the readability, how easily the shapes are recognized
  as hills and the relevance to the target audience.\r\n\r\nThe target audience is
  (this is taken from the associations design brief):\r\n\r\nA. Baby boomers and retirees,
  ages 45-75+, Interested in the outdoors, gathering places, diversity, art & culture,
  and education.\t\r\nB.  Upwardly mobile, professional / creative class with disposable
  income, ages 30-45\r\n\r\nThanks for your input."

  body: I agree with Adnix make the crossbar on the f's stronger also make the word
    find a lot smaller or in a different face to put the emphsis on the subject Fallbrook.
    Good start.

  body: "Is that Fallbrook Mass per chance?\r\n\r\nThis is an exceelent start. I don't
    read the \"F\"s as \"S\"s and I do see the hills. I agree with Dan about making
    \"Find\" smaller and strengthening the \"F\"'s crossbars.\r\n\r\nAdditiionally,
    you have a pefect opportunity for an \"fi\" ligature in \"Find\" and the \"dF\"
    connector looks contrived/unatural and detracts from the hill metaphor. I would
    lose that all together and finish the \"d\" closer to the baseline.\r\n\r\nKeep
    it coming this has great potential."
