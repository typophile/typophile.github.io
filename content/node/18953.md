  Ideally I would like to turn my \"luck\" into a useable skill.\r\n\r\nProblems i'm
  having...As i'm sure you already know since some of you are probably veterans. So
  bare with me, please.\r\n\r\n1. When i try to manually rag, the rythmn is a real
  mess. I've tried tracking +-20. Is there a visual limit to how far you can track
  before it becomes really noticeable? Perhaps there's a rule, perhaps it's by individual
  font.\r\n\r\n2. Are there any other \"tricks\" that you can share?\r\n\r\n3. Some
  will say there's a rule, i'm sure, but can you use a hyphen when ragging?\r\n\r\n4.
  Does anyone have suggestions for things to look for when ragging. I need to gain
  some ground here in order to be pleased.\r\n\r\nAnxiously awaiting your thoughts!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sorry about that, Marty... I couldn't help that reaction.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know what computer program you are using to do your typesetting, but usually tracking
    is not a good idea for this. Depending on the program you are using, there are
    other options.\r\n\r\nAs for your question about using hyphens, it depends on
    whether you want a tight or loose rag. Some people are okay with hyphens, some
    aren't. Even when you do allow hyphenation, there is a limit to how many hyphenated
    lines in a row look good (i.e., pleasing to the eye).\r\n\r\nI recommend getting
    a good book on typesetting -- plenty out there, but here's three of them:\r\n\r\nThe
    Elements of Typographic Style, by Robert Bringhurst\r\nThe Thames and Hudson Manual
    of Typography, by Ruari McLean\r\nThinking with Type, by Ellen Lupton\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps!"

    the column width a big factor when you're doing a rag? I know the right width

  body: "It also depends on the software you're using for layout. Quark is not as
    forgiving as InDesign is with the amount of tweaking. Or perhaps it's more accurate
    to say InDesign uses a different setting for autospacing and kerning. Some magazines
    have a standard that they will allow type to be kerned to; my experience is, in
    Quark don't go past -4 in body copy, and InDesign it seems that a -20/25 is the
    general threshold.\r\n\r\nSome clients don't mind hyphens in their copy, some
    make you turn hyphenation off. In my old job, we did a lot of government work
    and we were not allowed to use hyphens especially in bilingual material, each
    translator wanted to break words at different parts so they put a kibosh on hyphenation.
    \r\n\r\nYou want to make sure you watch out for widows/orphans and it's ok to
    use line breaks to knock down a word to balance out the rag a bit more. "

  body: "A trick I use - in Quark at least, I don't know Indy - is to work with H&Js.
    I have three settings: tight, normal, and loose. Since H&Js work more with word
    spacing than tracking it is usually less noticeable. Sometimes just changing from
    normal to tight can either fix a bad rag or pull up a widow. I also have a \"no
    hyphenation\" H&J where that's required (some clients do specify that, but it
    can be problematic at times).\r\n\r\nIt is always OK to use a hard return to bring
    down a pesky word, such as a \"to\" that is hanging off an edge visually. But
    you need to be extra careful about those hard returns if the text is edited later
    on so you don't end up with short lines.\r\n\r\nAlso  you want to avoid creating
    \"shapes\" in the rag, unsightly bulges or indentations that are too smooth -
    a good rag will have a visual rhythm that doesn't attract attention to itself.\r\n\r\nRe
    hyphens: preferably no more than 2 in a row, never more than 3. I try to avoid
    them in ragged text but sometimes it can't be helped. They should not stick out
    too far. Also set your H&Js so that there is a minimum of 3 characters either
    before or after a hyphen.\r\n\r\nFor tracking I try not to go to more than -2
    or +2 except in more forgiving fonts. But I always try to adjust the H&J before
    I track."

    can add space before or after a paragraph, if you happen to have a paragraph's
    style set up that way. You still have to be careful with later editing with soft
    returns, but they are more forgiving with things like formatting. :-)"

  body: "Another good trick in InDesign is the \"Nonbreaking Space\" (usually command-option-x);
    it looks like a word space but InDesign will treat the words on either side of
    it as one word. The nonbreaking space is better than a line break for killing
    widows, because if your type is ever re-flowed it won't create havoc.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of bringing up lines, I'd say to kern wordspaces first, even to -80 (indd
    units, not quark) depending on the characters around them, <em>then</em> apply
    tracking, usually not more than -5 (again, indd units). It sounds like Patty's
    method with H&Js is a smarter, more automated way of applying this idea..."

  body: Similar to pica pusher's suggestion about nbsp, in Quark you can also manually
    hyphenate using command+hyphen which tells the word where to hyphenate rather
    than inserting a hyphen that will need to be removed (again manually) if the text
    is edited or reflowed.

  body: "Word Spacing in H&J is the key. My default setting in Illustrator and InDesign
    is: \r\nMinimum: 65%\r\nDesired: 85%\r\nMaximum: 100%\r\n\r\nAnd I adjust it from
    there, usually lower, sometimes to 50/60/70. Better too close than too far apart.
    Always hyphenating if I can get away with it. Never adjust letterspacing, unless
    there is a visible kerning problem. An even rag obviously works better with space-saving
    fonts like Adobe Garamond or Minion. Tweak out the edge of the textblock a little
    too, as long as it doesn't make a noticeable difference but fixes the rag. I also
    switch between the Adobe Single-Line Composer and Every-Line Composer in the CS
    programs, sometimes one works better than the other.\r\n\r\nAnother trick I have
    used is to set the spaces between sentences in a different character style which
    has a different horizontal scaling than the rest of the paragraph. Then you can
    adjust the spaces all at once. This is a real pain to use, so I would recommend
    it only for situations that call for a paragraph of perfect type in a large size,
    where the character count is much shorter than normally desired."

  body: "I think that a lot of the rules to do with hyphenation are bunk. I have read
    my way through many books, and \"more than three\" hyphens have never bothered
    me, never hindered my reading or comprehension. It seems to be an easy target
    for people looking at typesetting to comment on. \r\n\r\nIf you have pretty tight
    copy that is near the final edit, you can do many things. I always try my darndest
    to honour consistent word & letterspacing. However, to re-jig paragraphs to eliminate
    widows (another bunk style issue) I will adjust tracking +5 to -5 (InDesign).
    My word spacing settings differ depending on context, but I try to limit it to
    about 20% from minimum to maximum. As others have also admitted to, I will also
    allow minute horizontal scaling, depending on the typeface  (totally un-noticeable
    if done properly). Another neat little trick is to subtlely adjust the width of
    your text boxes. This does absolute wonders for errant bits & bobs that need adjusting.
    This is also un-noticeable if done properly.\r\n\r\nIt all seems like a pain in
    the ass for people demanding justified text, but necessary to keep clients happy.
    Have fun!\r\n\r\n"
