  body: "Type is magical. It not only communicates a word\u2019s information, but
    it conveys a subliminal message in the letter shapes themselves. That civilizations
    created religious icons from letters and symbols is not without foundation. Good
    typography significantly increases the amount of attention a message receives.
    The right typeface is the basis of strong communication.\r\n\u2003Type alone cannot
    sustain a brand name or a corporate identity, but a brand with the wrong typeface
    will flounder helplessly trying to define itself. Type, layout, and color make
    up the equallateral triangle of brand identity. Like everything else in life,
    to be successful with type you have to first choose the right one, and then use
    it well. \r\n\u2003There is no foolproof recipe for selecting the right type for
    each and every purpose. Choosing the right type requires experience, intuition,
    and creativity. Which type best suits the headline, subhead, and copy of an ad,
    which for packaging design, which for technical products, and which for food\u2013in-depth
    research is necessary before an informed \r\ndecision can be made. \u2013 a quotation
    from Stefan R\xF3gener"
