body: I'm usually pretty slick at font ID but for some reason this one's escaping
  me. It might be because I'm on a  new system and my fonts aren't all installed yet,
  so my lovely long drop down list is only sparsely populated. Anyhoo, I have some
  branding to recreate and cannot find the name of this font for the life of me. Can
  anyone help, please?
