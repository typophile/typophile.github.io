body: "It is hard to choose a font at times, esp. when you donot really know what
  you can do, and not do when it comes to designing a page. Some contributors to this
  website have told visitors that Garamond is an ugly boring font. But it is not.
  It is one of the most legible fonts I know. It is well designed, and that goes for
  the ICT, Monotype and other garamonds. There is the profont version available and
  the Premier, which has been redesigned with 18th century types in the back of the
  fontdesigner's mind.\r\n\r\nThe best  version is however still the adobe Garamond,
  with small capitals, ligatures, italic old style, bold and semibold. To get a great
  result you have to switch off automatic leading and go for 2 or 3 points leading,
  so 10 on 12, or 11 on 13, and depending on the measure (smaller esp) 11 on 14, or
  10 on 13.\r\nNow wordspace and justification is important. Go for a basic paragraph
  style, a tight and a loose one ( between 80 and 120 ), and watch for the hyphenation
  panel ( 6-letter words, 3, 3 and 2 hyphens) and choose ligatures when going over
  the panel characterstyles.\r\nJenson Pro, Centaur and Galliard work as well, and
  that goes for Goudy old Style. Sans Serifs, I would never use that for lots of texts.
  That is hard on the reader.\r\nStudy Morrison, Kapf, Simon and other D.W.Dwiggins. "
