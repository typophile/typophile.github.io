body: "Dear all,\r\n\r\nI tried a mark positioning feature for an arabic font with
  the latest FDK, but didn't succeed.\r\nFeature looks like this (anchor positions
  are made up for now), as suggested in the FDK syntax definition:\r\n\r\n<code>feature
  mark {\r\n\r\n\tmarkClass [uni0651 uni064B] <anchor 250 20> @TOP_MARKS;\r\n\tposition
  mark [uni0631] <anchor 400 200> mark @TOP_MARKS;\r\n\r\n} mark;</code>\r\n\r\nBut
  the marks don't position (InDesign CS3 ME 5.0.4)\r\nEdit: the base and mark glyphs
  now also defined in GDEF/GlyphClassDef, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thank
  you in advance."
