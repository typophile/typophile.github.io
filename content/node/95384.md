  it does not match any digitized set I have come across. I would be very thankful
  for any suggestions for what might resemble this.\r\n\r\nSorry for the lousy image;
  I don't have a proper camera at hand.\r\n"

  body: Thanks, Jan. This is one of the things that has me confused. That glyph belongs
    in Baskerville, but the letters don't have that characteristic wide feeling that
    comes with Baskerville. I find the round and balanced shape much more reminiscent
    of Caslon... But then I don't really know this stuff, so I'm thankful for any
    kind of input.

  body: "Yeah, I've looked at every single Baskerville I could find, but they all
    feel heavier and more square-ish than this. But now I am more or less convinced
    that this is indeed <em>a</em> Baskerville,  only a cut which is not available
    today in digital form. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows a Baskerville
    with this round feeling, I'd really appreciate a tip."

  body: "The lack of kerning, and the \xABamputated\xBB italic f tell me that it\u2019s
    probably the Linotype machine version of Baskerville. But the digital Linotype
    version won\u2019t give you the same feel."

  body: That's probably spot on, Jens. I hate kerned fonts, characters getting all
    intimate with each other! Give me back glyphs with carefully perfected spacing!
    Give me back that sober amputated italic f!

    that italic f in several metal Caslons, that I have also been chasing in digital

  body: I compared your sample to a 1960s Linotype catalogue. The Baskerville shown
    in it is close, but not an exact match.
