  Ef \u0424.\r\nWhile comparing several typefaces, I noticed that many of them include
  Phi and Ef designed separately.\r\n\r\nBasically it seems that you can extend the
  stem beyond the baseline and Cap line for the sake of visual adjustment, and you
  can do it further with Phi (I've seen some inscriptions that have O part  of \u03A6
  aligned to the baseline and Cap line).\r\n\r\nBut even with those which do not include
  extended Phi \u03A6 and Ef \u0424, they are still designed differently.\r\nFor example,
  Lucida Grande's Greek Phi is made slightly bolder and wider than Cyrillic Ef.\r\n\r\nIf
  you are aware of this issue, please tell me why they are treated that way (historical
  or practical reasons behind it), and the problem of using identical outline."

    is that as a rule one should try to make so-called \"cognate\" characters somehow
    different, irrespective of whether there's any historic reason for a given glyph
    to diverge. This is because: information (in this case concerning what language/script
    one is reading) comes from contrast; and it gives a given script a stronger identity.\r\n\r\nOne
    of my favorite examples is the \"Y\" in Adobe Sava.\r\n\r\nBTW, Armenian has a
    similar glyph, the Piwr \u0553.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Why?\r\nBecause you don't have to make them the same.\r\nIf your design process
    includes assessing a glyph shape by setting it in text in the Metrics window,
    then the different scripts might lead you to optimize Ef and Phi differently.
    I ended up making Ef wider than Phi, in one of my typefaces, because it looked
    better that way in words.\r\n\r\nConsider capital Lamda and El, for a drastic
    example of differentiation.\r\nIn Greek, Lambda is always triangular, but in Cyrillic
    it may be either triangular (in \"old style\" and certain geometric styles) or
    rectangular (the \"modern\" style), depending on the genre of type.\r\n\r\nThe
    Ef with extenders beyond cap boundaries is somewhat mannered, as evidenced by
    its adoption at the HermesSoft foundry as the pointedly different Bulgarian Cyrillic
    style.\r\n\r\nAs with Latin (think of Q's tail), there is room to maneuver if
    you are designing an original typeface. There are all sorts of variants of Ef,
    two-bowl, one-bowl, with and without prominent \"extenders\". \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_5600.jpeg]"

  body: "> I ended up making Ef wider than Phi\r\n\r\nWidth is actually a very relevant
    factor here. Some scripts* need looser setting - and naturally this affects the
    \"inside whites\", and potentially the black bodies as well. Admittedly there
    <em>is</em> relevance to uniformity, but really only in display setting (and not
    even always) and pretty much none in text (except in very broad stylistic terms).
    Blindly making so-called \"cognate\" characters the same is just bad design in
    my book.\r\n\r\n* Like Armenian. And really any two scripts (in fact any\r\ntwo
    <em>languages</em>!) necessarily have different spacing needs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    like glyphs differ in both outline and metrics but no-one should imply that it

    similar characters at the outset and making the rest of the characters harmonise
    with these like characters? Cue howls of derision and mocking because I don't
    know about a particular ductus! Well, apologies to the purists.\r\n"

    having a reason to break apart cognates, as I've said elsewhere, it depends where
    a given design is on the Display-Text axis (noting that it can never be at either
    extreme). Formal harmony of shapes is admittedly very relevant towards the Display
    end; but in my mind there can be no doubt that the information arising from differences
    handily overpowers such considerations towards the Text end.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    characters like A or T, even in text faces. It seems to go against the idea of
    typeface: uniformity (of course everyone has a different sense of uniformity and
    diversity, so the sweet spot is vast). At least I will keep it that way until
    I am fully aware of the differences of each script (it's only the first time for
    me to design a multi-script typeface). Anyway, my \u03A6s in my new text face
    are individually adjusted to fit Greek and Cyrillic!\r\n\r\n>hrant\r\nOut of curiosity,
    I'm wondering how Armenian Piwr should be made differently. If you make a typeface
    that consists of Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/Armenian how would you do to those three
    \u03A6s? If the answer is too easy, let's say the Armenian should be 100% vertical
    as the others."

  body: "> I'm wondering how Armenian Piwr should be made differently.\r\n\r\nThe
    Piwr is indeed difficult to diverge. I frankly don't know how to make it structurally
    different without also making it too peculiar (at least in a contemporary context;
    I could use a strange historical form as a pretext, but I'm not into that sort
    of thing). However there's always the factor of width, which is almost guaranteed
    to have different needs between scripts, due to:\r\n\r\n1) The ideal overall letterspacing,
    which affects not just the sidebearings but the inside whites as well.\r\n2) The
    typical/average width that the letters want to be. For example Armenian capitals
    (in the contemporary context*) are narrower than Latin overall because there are
    many arches and virtually no diagonals.\r\n3) In the case of capital letters,
    the necessity to stand out from its lowercase (assuming the cap height is nicely
    lower than the ascenders). For example when the lowercase is particularly tall
    (many Armenian letters span the entire height) its capital needs to be extra wide.
    For example \u0586 vs \u0556. The \u0583 is also pretty hefty, so I make the \u0553
    wider than I otherwise would.\r\n\r\n* Armenian caps also have the archaic option
    of diverging greatly in width.\r\nSee: http://typophile.com/node/66620\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
