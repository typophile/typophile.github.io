  this question might prove to be quite stupid as i'm a complete newbie when it comes
  to Ms Word etc.. I'm trying to create my first cv for an internship and i came across
  this template which i liked.. But i cant figure out the Font..where it says the
  name \"Paul Malone\" its Not Times New Roman.. I cant figure out the colour of the
  font below too..its bordering on brown i think.\r\n\r\nAlso if possible please let
  me what i need to use to be able to insert my contact details between those two
  horizontal bars just below \"Paul Malone\" .. if i insert a line in Ms Word it doesnt
  really let me type in between them like in this CV..\r\n\r\nany help at all would
  be greatly appreciated..\r\nThank you in advance."

  body: i cant seem to get the color of the font right.. the font used in the main
    body of the resume.. its a darker shade of olive than is available in most applications..
    and the font used in the main body.. the size seems to be smaller than 8 yet with
    palatino the smallest size is 8 below which it just starts looking weird.

    is as small as I would go for a cv, it appears black on my monitor rather than
    olive.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I'm not sure what you're asking about how to format things in Word, but getting
    a line of text between 2 horiz bars should be pretty straight forward. Since word
    will substitute a  horiz bar anytime you type 3 hyphens in a row, enter:\r\n---
    \    [hyphen][hyphen][hyphen][enter]\r\n(your contact info here) [enter] \r\n---
    \    [hyphen][enter]\r\n\r\nthat should get you roughly what you're asking about,
    I think.\r\n\r\nThe color of the text in the graphic you pointed to is black.
    Unless it shows in a different color while you're editing it?\r\n\r\nJason C"
