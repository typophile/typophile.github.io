  had specific settings for illustrator and fontlab when importing files from illustrator.\r\n\r\nI
  cannot find those old tips and I see that that forum is gone on MSN - though that
  was for an older version of fontlab. Are there similar settings for illustrator
  CS and fontlab 5.0?\r\n\r\nIf not, can anyone give me suggestions for H/W dimensions
  for inside illustrator for creating glyphs?\r\n\r\nAny help or feedback appreciated"
