  body: It is said on [[http://ssawmagazine.com/current-issue|this page]] that [[http://www.helsinkitypestudio.com|Helsinki
    Type Studio]] was in charge of Spring Summer 2012 issue type design. They may
    have also create this masthead. Their typeface, [[http://www.helsinkitypestudio.com/typefaces/bastard-semibold.php|Bastard]],
    looks pretty close. They may have start with this one and customize it.
