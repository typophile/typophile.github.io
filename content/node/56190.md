body: I feel dumb posting a thread for this question, but I've searched the entire
  forum with several different combinations of words, plus YouTube, plus Google, and
  I cannot find what I am looking for. I remember seeing on this forum a while back
  a video of a father and a son making brush alphabets side-by-side. It's a wonderful
  video, and I want to show it to someone, but I really can't find it. Does anyone
  happen to have it bookmarked?

    interested in developmental psych; she loved it! It's great when our interests
    overlap like that.
