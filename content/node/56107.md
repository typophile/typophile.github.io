  What is the type face used for the R in this image? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/rated_r_3896.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: My understanding is the same as the above post - we get ours as EPS files
    that have to be converted so that they can be used as shape layers in Photoshop
    (the lines are still stroked, etc.). They get periodically updated, but it's done
    by the production staff, I don't know where they get them from. I'll try to remember
    to ask on Monday.
