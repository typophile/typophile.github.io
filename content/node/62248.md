body: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nThis is my first time posting, although I have known about
  this site for quite a while. I don't know why I hadn't signed up before, but I felt
  recently like this project warrents it.\r\n\r\nI am a senior at the University of
  Utah in Salt Lake City. I am working on a semester long project which requires us
  to build two clocks. The clocks have to be based on a similar idea, but they but
  be different from each other visually. \r\n\r\nMy clock series is going to be called
  Lunar Solar, or Lunar / Solar. The clocks must keep accurate time, but it doesn't
  have to be easy to read them. The clocks are going to be backlit, and will have
  rotating elements that are mostly black printed on a transparent piece of plastic,
  which will at times hide the numerals or the hands of the clock, making it hard
  to read. The idea is basically \"such is the nature of the moon and sun\" I suppose,
  being that it's not always easy to observe either one, but sometimes (full moon
  or lunar eclipse) it can be beautiful. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lunar-solar-finals_4912.jpg]\r\n\r\nthese
  are the three logotypes, which are very rough, that I am considering. The top two
  felt like they needed the \"/\". I'm not sure that I like it on the top and the
  bottom, as it doesn't make sense. I like throwing off the balance of the AR AR with
  a single /, which I should have shown in hindsight, but that felt somewhat awkward
  at the same time. Perhaps it will just take more fine-tuning to be resolved. \r\n\r\nThe
  upper two are both Gotham, the bottom one is Didot small caps. \r\n\r\nI removed
  the cross bars on the As because I liked the idea of the O being the only letter
  with a counter. However, when I made the R of the gotham a continuous stroke as
  I did on the Didot R, it made me want to lose my dinner. The Didot also doesn't
  feel like it NEEDS the /, but I may add one anyways.\r\n\r\nI also like the inverted
  A (or V) in place of the U, it speaks to roman numerals which relates back to the
  clock. I might be trying too hard with that though, what do you think?\r\n\r\nI
  haven't spent enough time to feel comfortable with the letterspacing either, but
  I thought I would throw these up for some initial feedback, if you are willing.\r\n\r\nThank
  you all ahead of time!"

  body: I'm immediately drawn to the second one -- I don't have a solid reason why,
    it's just aesthetically pleasing. The one element that feels out of place is the
    R at the end of both words. It feels a bit heavy, like it's wanting to be more
    old New York industrial, with that heavy bowl sitting on top, and the rest of
    the words feel like they're Laser engraved into the space shuttle, which I think
    is the correct feel for this based on what you said about the sun and moon. I
    would suggest just modifying that R a bit, so it's more like the Didot R below
    it, where it's not closed.

  body: 'One other thought: you might want to create some subtle inktraps for that
    N in LUNAR, because it feels a bit heavy in comparison to the other letters. Just
    where the diagonal bar intersects with the two stems, it gets a bit dark. But
    overall, I really like this logo!'

  body: "Hi Trevor,\r\n\r\nLooking at what you've done already, I like the first variation
    most. That said, I think that lunar and solar are very contrasting words so it
    would be interesting to perhaps play with or accent that contrast. Not too fond
    of the Didot version as it looks too classical, Roman...\r\n\r\nNice overall work
    though!"

  body: "the third looks most like a roman, ancient chiseled representation, thus
    the 'u' and 'a' shapes make sense to be rendered like they are with v's. i would
    keep the kerning like it is but manipulate the r to have the interior point connect.
    it would keep it tight and obvious, since you are asking your viewer to consider
    the abstract nature of the u and a, they might overthink the r. that last bit
    of advice may be overkill but worth a look at least.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled
