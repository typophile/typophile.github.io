body: 'This might be some custom hack, I don&#39;t know... Most of the letters are
  in the round bauhaus style, but there are a few idiosyncracies: The &#39;e&#39;
  looks light it&#39;s straight from Frutiger, the &#39;s&#39; is normal, and the
  &#39;C&#39; is very closed, and more oval than round. Otherwise, most of the letters
  follow the bauhaus style. It&#39;s a medium-bold weight.'

  body: I&#39;m thinking more and more that it&#39;s custom. I saw it on TV on some
    signage, and it just seemed so deliberate, like someone said, &#34;well I don&#39;t
    like the e or the s, they just don&#39;t look normal.&#34; I mean, it&#39;s literally
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/65-bold/win-ttf/187428/character/0065/CP2/">
    the e from Fruitger</a>, which is not very Bauhaus.
