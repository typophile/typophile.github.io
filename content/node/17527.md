  body: "thanks for your help (and knowledge), since Photo-Lettering Inc. is no more,
    i'm hoping some one else took the time to make a digital version. possibly for
    the 1999 release of jimi hendrix's live at fillmore east. i've sent an email to
    the design company that did the work, but have yet to hear back.\r\n\r\nmany thanks."
