  body: Really like this one too. Thought it is from [[http://fontworks.co.jp|Fontworks]]
    but I was wrong. [[http://fontworks.co.jp/font/classic/cezanne/M.html|Cezanne]]
    is nice but many details are off (/M centre vertex, /G...). Reminds me also some
    Lineto like [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Headline+Fonts/Lutz+Headline|Lutz
    Headline]], mainly because it feels 'DIN' to me... Anyway, that's far from solving
    this ID. May be Akira could solve it...
