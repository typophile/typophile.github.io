  and here http://emergent.unpythonic.net/software/hershey) to a standard/modern format?
  \ Obviously it would be impossible to keep them as pure lines, but it seems like
  someone would have used them for a thin typeface or one designed to be used with
  strokes.\r\n\r\nSecond question: if no one has done this yet, is it a suitable project
  for a beginner?"
