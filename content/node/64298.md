  body: "I can't think of any actual examples offhand of types supplied this way,
    but this could be the result of the fact that typefaces can be distorted both
    in typesetting machines and on computers: I had thought that one way in which
    it is actually fairly common for a typeface to have two italic versions is where
    in addition to a conventional italic, with some script-like characteristics, one
    also has the option of using an italic which is just the original Roman font,
    slanted.\r\n\r\nAlso, with Venetian Old Style fonts, like Bembo, the companion
    italic is usually a separate font the letters of which are much narrower. Some
    such fonts might have a conventional italic as an alternative more palatable to
    modern readers, but again, I can't cite an example."

    the licensing situation with them, but you could try getting in touch.\r\n\r\nSince
