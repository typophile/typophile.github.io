body: I am looking to purchase a table top letterpress in good working condition that
  is 5x8 or larger. I would like to purchase one that can either be shipped or located
  somewhere in 250-500 mile radius of Franklin, TN so I can pick it up. If you have
  one available that you are selling please email me with a description, location,
  and how much you would like for it. Or, if you know of any good resources other
  than ebay, that would be great. Thank you so much! Kathleen

    Isle of Printing in Nashville, or Jim Sheradden at Hatch Show Print? They might
    be able to point you in the right direction for letterpresses.
