		<div class="commentbody">&gt;&quot;Unfortunately however, sales of font software for Precision Type and many others companies in the font business have been adversely affected in recent years by a growing supply of free font software via the Internet.&quot; (From Precision Type's announcement) <BR> <BR>Is that really the case? <BR> <BR>Possible culprits: <BR> <BR>1. Free fonts: bundled with applications (Adobe) <BR>2. Free fonts: with operating sytems (Apple, Microsoft) <BR>3. Free fonts: Freefonts.com, etc. <BR>4. Cheap font collections: Adobe, Bitstream, Corel  <BR>5. Pirated fonts: online p2p <BR>6. Pirated fonts:  b2b  <BR>7. Online competition: mega-stores (Myfonts, Fonts.com) <BR>8. Online competition: proliferation of online foundries and distributors <BR>9. Competition in general: eg Veer's DM + online <BR>10. Product selection. <BR> <BR>On this last point, it may be that Precision Type had over-associated itself with foundries (see list on its obituary page) that started out as &quot;wholesale suppliers&quot;, but subsequently ramped up their &quot;factory sales&quot; internet activity to become much stronger competitors.  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, <BR> <BR>There is a pretty huge difference between Microsoft's bundling web browsers and media players in their operating system, and other folks bundling fonts with their applications. Among other things, I doubt you'll find folks engaged in font bundling writing notes to each other about how the small type foundries must have their air supply cut off. <BR> <BR>I rather suspect that making false public allegations that somebody is breaking the law can get you in trouble. I don't know whether your current comments are libellous. I also don't know how much of a defence ignorance is against a libel lawsuit. I just think you should be a little more careful. <BR> <BR>This isn't a threat or anything: even if I was personally ticked off enough to talk to our lawyers, I doubt Adobe would bother with this sort of nonsense. But you're making pretty broad blanket statements, and some folks in the type industry are much more aggressive in their legal activities than Adobe is. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Also, did Precision Type ever offer online ordering and downloading of fonts?</i> <BR> <BR>It's been four years since I worked for a company that was a reseller for Precision Type (Beowulf in St. Paul). At that time they sent us several CDs with all their fonts. We'd send a P.O. for the font we wanted and they'd send us a code to unlock the font. We could then e-mail the fonts to our buyers. At the time it seemed speedy! <BR> <BR>I use their book often when trying to track down unfamiliar typefaces. However, it's much easier just to post a sample here on the identification board. The speed of responses here is just amazing! <BR> <BR>kristin <BR></div>
