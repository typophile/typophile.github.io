body: It seems to me that it's hard to find a sans-serif typeface that has anything
  other than identical or nearly-identical stroke weights throughout. I'm looking
  for something much more like a Didone, or at least a Garalde, in terms of stroke
  weight, but a sans-serif. Has anybody got any recommendations? Thanks!

  body: These are great suggestions, but nothing's working for me yet. I need to match
    Adobe Jenson Pro alongside some ornamentation. So many of these have an Art Deco
    slant that will pull too much focus. The sans-serif part of this design is more
    of a subheader to the main title, which is in Jenson. Anyway, please keep ideas
    coming! Thanks! :-)

  body: ITC Legacy Sans would really match Jenson, like John said. It has its roots
    in Jenson, so it shouldn't cause you much problems.
