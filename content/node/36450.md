  body: I just had a look again at the picture in your link. It's not Jugendstil,
    it's much closer to Art Deco which was the later movement popularizing the modernist
    movement. You should look for (proto) Art Deco type with a teutonic flair instead.

    or Munich \u2014 they're not Inline, but they come pretty close."

    of the offerings are by the very prolific members of the free font movement and
    many are historical renditions from one period or another.\r\n\r\nGerald"
