body: I am setting up a table of contents that will have middots connecting items
  and page numbers (with apologies to Bringhurst); I'm wondering if there is some
  method I am not aware of that would allow me to have all of the dots set with perfectly
  consistent spacing, rather than doing it by hand (which yields imperfect results
  in addition to being intensely laborious). To further complicate matters, there
  will be, in some cases, a third column inserted into the center of the middots,
  which makes doing it by hand nearly impossible to do without creating a bunch of
  separate text boxes. Any ideas?

  body: "In InDesign, you can assign tab leaders to your line/paragraph. Using tab
    leaders make the characters that you \"fill\" space with set independently of
    the text... though I prefer to use TWO characters for my tabs, one period and
    one space (\". \") - makes the leader dots less dense (you can also track the
    letterspace on the tabs, but this is a little more work to keep consistent).\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inD_5232.gif]"

    character".

  body: I meant that, I just didn't finish my thought. By tabular figures I suggested
    this just if he really wanted the figures to line up perfectly.

  body: "Got it. That makes a lot of sense. I was entirely unaware of the feature,
    but it's certainly the right tool for the job. With both tabular figures and patience
    everything should fall into place.\r\n\r\nThanks so much."

    the general idea anyway, so just for the record:\r\nThis is how one could set
    up the middle column.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tabs_4999.png]\r\nThe
    first tab isn\u2019t really necessary, but with that, you can easily control where
    the dots should begin. (You can do that by adding spaces, too \u2013 also for
    the two other tabs)\r\n\r\nThe \u2018fill character\u2019 is called exactly like
    that in the German version: \u2018F\xFCllzeichen\u2019. In the English one, it\u2019s
    \u2018leader\u2019. You can insert more than just one character, e.g. middot+space
    for a wider spacing. \r\n\r\nOf course, the second and the third tab can be left-aligned,
    too \u2013 as you please.\r\nF"

  body: "That's great \u2014 thank you. That is just the layout I'm looking to build,
    and I doubt I would have come up with that first tab on my own. Both section numbers
    on the left and page numbers on the right will have points/periods amidst the
    numbers, so that will also give me the opportunity to master the \"align on\"
    feature. It is still a bit cumbersome going, but I'm optimistic. "

  body: Don't add spaces.  Use a character style for your dot leader.  I increase
    the tracking and the size slightly.  If you use a character style for your dot
    leader, then you can play with it very easily until you get it "just right".  You
    can watch a video on this at lynda.com (InDesign Style Sheets).  You can get a
    free trial subscription by going to lynda.com/deke.  If you use InDesign extensively,
    the entire style sheet video is really good information.
