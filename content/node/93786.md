    replied promptly:\r\n\"It's a custom typeface. We designed it for another project

  body: "Sorry for overlooking at your request, I thought you were trying to identify
    the sans backward (which is Aper\xE7u). And, I didn't know the typeface used for
    \"2012\" but with the previous post by John Lyttle, we know now it's a custom
    job. Anyway, I risk a similar: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stereotypes/st-friska/|St
