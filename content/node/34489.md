body: "I'm not nearly finished, but I'm starting to feel hesitant about this design.
  \r\n\r\nThe resume is for my sister, she's an interior designer with a few years
  in the business. I wanted to create an inviting design that has a clean modern look
  without being too overwhelming. As a male, designing for a female doesn't come as
  natural.\r\n\r\nI could really use some ideas for the section headers/dividers (Experience,
  Education, Skills/Computer Proficiency and Accomplishments). I originally was thinking
  a design similar to a folder tab, inverted.\r\n\r\nThe fonts I'm using are: Whitman,
  Whitney and Caecilia.\r\n\r\nI know there's not much there, but every time I add
  something it seems really odd. Also, the order of things seems weird. She wants
  here Experience first, Education second and all the other filler, third."

    an inch)."

    really sure how to approach the Additional Skills layout. Ideas?\r\n\r\nConor:
    I shrank the right column by 3/4 of an inch, a whole inch created too many orphans."

  body: "Too many colors for me.\r\n\r\nAgree with above post about the major headings.
    Setting Additional Skills on 2 lines would also allow the lines to be standardized.\r\n\r\nNice
    work."

  body: "Good points. I'll try these suggestions, not sure about losing the bullet
    points or changing the leading, it reads rather well printed.\r\n\r\nI do agree
    however, she does have a lot of information. I might try and convince her to par
    it down to 5 most important points. \r\n\r\nHer name and contact info will be
    across the top, but I'm leaving that off because of privacy concerns. If you can
    figure who she is from this information, you probably already know her.\r\n\r\n"
