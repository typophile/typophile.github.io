  mystery! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1487480870_db5001d20d_5867.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  absolutely love the typeface used for \"Futurismo\", although I suspect that might
  be custom?\r\nWhat I'd really love to know is the name of the type / similar type
  for the green text, ie, \"Benito Mussolini\" and \"Evviva il genio futurista di\".\r\n\r\nI
  understand that in the early 1900s there wouldn\u2019t be typefaces created, necessarily.
  I am looking for something similar\u2014perhaps a newly digitized version of the
  linotype.\r\n\r\nThis cover is from the\_newspaper Futurismo, designed by Enrico
  Prampolini in 1933.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\nNatalina"

    Maryellen McFadden from https://www.flickr.com/photos/20745656@N00/1487480870/in/photostream/\r\n<blockquote>Prampolini
    designed the newspaper Futurisimo, edited by Marinetti and Somenzi 1933. Futurism

    I think you could play around with Ltt [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/uomo|Uomo]]
    and its [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/uomo/condensed-bold/glyphs.html|alternates]]
    (mainly /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/uomo/condensed-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/638830/38|M]]),
    it has a good /S which is probably the trickier glyph here redrawing /R and /O
    and adjusting /M centre vertex; I like also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/novotypo/nt-cornelia|Cornelia]],
