body: The infamous inverted Jenny stamp has a fun 30s font I would love to use but
  can&#39;t seem to identify. Any help greatly appreciated. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65311.jpg"

  body: Brian, your not going to try to recreate the inverted Jenny stamp are you?
    Just because Deke McClelland showed how to make it in Photoshop User in the July/August
    2003 and Sept. 2003 Issues. Take his warning &#40;lots of time in jail&#41;
