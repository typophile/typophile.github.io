body: "Hello! Can you help me?\r\nDoes anyone know what font is this? It's used in
  the 1952 brazilian movie poster for O Cangaceiro. The film was awarded at Cannes,
  being very famous at that time. I have been looking for a while at some similar
  fonts, but none of them have an A or an E like those. I appreciate your attention.
  May be silly but it's very important for my graduation research and I am not an
  expert in typography. Thank you very much!\r\n\r\nI posted this in the forum some
  time ago (http://typophile.com/node/104180), got one reply but don't consider it
  solved. This font id section didn't existed, so now I post here still in search
  of an answer. Thank you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cangaceiro_5663_5670.png]\r\n\r\nHere's
  the answer I got from Ryuk (27 Jun 2013):\r\nDon't have a match unfortunately. Some
  in the same vein needing editing/customization: (DIN) Engschrift Austria D (mainly
  reworking /G), Korolev, Komu B, Pakt Black (/R off), Tempus Gothic Alternate"

  body: The Brazilian and world distribution rights were sold to Columbia Pictures,
    so more than likely the movie posters were printed in the US. A search for foundry
    and phototype matching the title doesn't turn up anything that matches. Given
    the size of the original poster, the era it was produced in plus some of the details
    of the type and its spacing, I believe this was hand-lettered.
