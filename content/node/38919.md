body: "Hello, I'm new here, but can anyone tell me what type faces are currently used
  in Rolling Stone Magazine? I know Parkinson is used. I've read Proxima mentioned
  in another thread on this site, but I can't find a solid answer for the body text.
  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.\r\nSteve"

    Font ID Guide</a> to see if you can ID that way. If the typeface is custom, you
    may at least find something similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Looks like nobody here has a copy of Rolling Stone magazine handy, so your
    best bet would be to scan the type on the pages and post the samples here.
