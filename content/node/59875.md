  to our announcements blog.  The aim is to showcase typefaces in action.\r\n\r\nWe've
  started off with a small collecton of images showcasing the role of typefaces in
  promoting the world's favorite confectionery, chocolate.  We plan to grow the gallery
  into a large archive.\r\n\r\nAs well as our own material, we'd welcome any Gallery
  contributions from users of our typefaces-which can be e-mailed to [[mailto:gatf1@live.com
  | gatf1@live.com]] in .png, .jpg or .pdf formats.  A fully licensed copy of Absinette
  Regular will be supplied to everyone whose work is displayed in the gallery.  Feel
  free to base your work on any of out faces (including the free ones on Myfonts.com)
  and let us know your prefered format for Absinette regular .ttf or .otf, as well
  as what acknowledgement you'd like your ontribution to be credited with.\r\n\r\nIn
