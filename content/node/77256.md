  I tried to use the forum with my old login/password. I couldn't, so I re register.\r\nIt
  took me around 10 attempts to figure out the true 'anti spam' code (it is so confusing
  that you really do not know if it is a number or a letter...). I finally got a mail
  saying my registration needed the approval of the administrator. Today, still no
  news...\r\nI tried to login again and the answer now is my login name does not exist
  (but yesterday it was pending approval...)\r\nPlease, help. I am not going to do
  the registrations again.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"
