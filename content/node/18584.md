  I saw it in a letraset catalogue from the mid eighties. It's kinda like busorama\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lendaproducts.com/graphics/letstyle/busor.htm\r\n\r\nyep.\r\ncheers

  body: "Just a note that Marbolo was Thomas E. Harvey's widely distributed tryout
    version of his font Marbold. He was one of that crowd of early 1990's freeware/shareware
    typeface digitizers (Rakowski, Rick Mueller, Mike Allard, etc.). You'd send him
    the shareware fee and he'd send you Marbold. I, too, am unaware of any other digitization
    of Marvin.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the quality is not the greatest - but surely the font
    making tools at that time were rather primitive."
