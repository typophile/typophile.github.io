    doing a gallery piece ... we'll see how that one goes.\r\n\r\nRyan, I used html
    img src tag and instead of uploading from the hard drive, I now uploaded from
    my own domain. I'm pretty sure you could also use some image hosting site like
    image shack and that will get your images up too. \r\n\r\nWow, there is a goth
    Barbie. I'm not sure I needed to know that though... thanks Dan.\r\n\r\n\r\nn."
