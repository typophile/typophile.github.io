  with a small cap 'i' with dot by default ?\r\nI kind of remember a design by Schwartz
  but maybe it was Bil'ak.\r\nIf you know other SC font having this \"glyphing,\"
  please let me know, much appreciate."

  body: "Thanks for this new reference, Stephen ; the thing is that Turkish language
    wants the dot on the \u0131 sometimes, and I am wondering about this issue for
    SC book titling.\r\nWhich will be the right slot in the font then, if not found
    by default ?"

  body: I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Are you creating a font and wanting
    to know about character encodings or looking for a typeface with small caps and
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=turkish">Turkish</a>
    support?

  body: "Cool, Stephen. Yes, I am doing a title font, only caps/smallcaps and I'd
    like to know if it is a strange habit to have the small cap <em>i with dot</em>
    as default for a multilanguage supporting SC font. Thanks fro replying in the
    ID section\u2014\u2014I was looking for comparison and I seem not to find this
    specimen printout I remember I had, I know I thought, \"uau, this is a clever
    trick, a good writing actualization, yet a good visually balanced text face.\""
