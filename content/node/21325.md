body: "anybody know what the typefaces are?\r\n\r\n\r\nmy guesses:\r\n\r\nVANCOUVER\r\n-
  i have no idea. i was thinking maybe its a version of frutiger from some obscure
  foundry.\r\n- the top extension of the 'E' has an angle on it that is really throwing
  me off.\r\n\r\nmuseum:\r\n- it looks like bodoni to me but the top serif stems are
  off. is this a bodoni that somebody tried to customize?\r\n\r\n\r\nCan anybody shed
  some light on this for me?"
