  examples of American typography between 1836 (Battle of the Alamo) and 1890 (Wounded
  Knee).\r\n\r\n(The backdrops to the first and last 'Western' movies, according to
  Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nWhich typefaces were used in American books and newspapers at
  this time? A lot of material I have seen looks like it is, or is very similar to
  Bodoni. Was type imported from Europe?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    American types i must say that Slab Serif are the american typefaces, the so called
    egyptians (the inventors of the egyptians were the british, not the americans).
    I can give you a brief of what is slab and how it started if you really are interested
    on that.\r\nAbout typefaces from that period of time i can say to you Ziggurat
    HTF (a good passage to digital from a typeface from xix century), the western
    style can be found too on fonts like Zebrawood, Rosewood, Madame...\r\nTell me
    if it is that that you want, that you're searching for...\r\n\r\nJoel Santos //

  body: As far as text faces, most of the American fonts in use at this time were
    in the "modern" classification, but more likely to be the Scotch Roman variety
    than Bodoni. The individuality in design that one associates with this period
    shows up in display faces, both metal fonts and woodtype. These can be found in
    the specimen books of the era. This period was also the heydey of piracy through
    stereotyping, so while there were enough American type foundries by this time
    to make importing fonts from Europe unnecessary, designs may have been "imported"
    by this method of copying.

  body: "Thanks Joel and Juliet\r\n\r\nI will do some reading on Scotch Roman!\r\nImporting/copying
    is great. The typeface is for a book called 'Here once again'. It is about film
    & art and interpretation is one of the recurrent themes. Therefore revisiting
    ideas, interpretation and copying are actually quite relevant! \r\n\r\nThe book
    is bilingual, Korean and English. As a joke we decided to make the Western part
    'Western', an homage to the Western genre of film. Scotch Roman type is probably
    a nice way to cool down any stereotypes of this genre.\r\n\r\nJuliet do you know
    of any digitizations of said style?\r\n\r\nMany thanks to both your answers\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n"

    be useful for 1985, as i said \"a good passage to digital from a typeface from
    xix century\" ! When it's a passage, it must be a revival, for his use he needs
    a digital way.\r\n\r\n1985, have you seen the ones i told you?\r\n\r\nJoel Santos

    of titling rather than text. Scotch Roman seems more appropriate!\r\n\r\nAny good
    digital examples of this genre?\r\n\r\nThanks all\r\n\r\n"

    tells the story.\r\nScotch Modern is an accurate revival of a face by George Bruce
    (probably) from a book printed in 1870 in Albany.\r\nMiller & Richards was the
    name of a foundry; there were many faces produced there over the years.\r\nAFAIK
    the Carter face name alludes to earlier days, before Richards got involved.\r\nMiller
    is a Scotch Roman, the Scotch Modern and Modernized Oldstyle are later styles."
