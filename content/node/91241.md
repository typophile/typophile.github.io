    that Google does - raising their own products to the top of lists such as search
    responses, 'more like this' lists, etc.\r\n\r\nBut look on the bright side. At
    least it wasn't Microsoft that bought it!\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: For my part, I've seen fewer fonts sold at MyFonts and a decline in performance
    in their WhatTheFont server.

  body: Sorry, I meant that the offering seems to have shrunk. At least regarding
    Monotype's own typefaces (which now still aren't sold by MyFonts even in Adobe's
    versions).

  body: Yes, it looks that some of them have been added back (still no Helvetica Neue,
    for example). We will see how it turns out, I suppose.

  body: "Riccardo, Linotype and Monotype fonts were pulled from MyFonts about a year
    ago (I don't remember exactly), apparently because MyFonts was doing so well that
    more Lino/Mono fonts were being sold there than on the Lino/Mono sites, with MyFonts
    taking a cut. Now that they are one company, they are back, as one would expect.
    \r\n\r\nI wonder how soon I will lose my top spot on the MyFonts best sellers
    page now that Helvetica is back."

  body: I have noticed a drop in sales since the Monotype buyout.  It appears that
    the number of times my fonts appear on the front page is off significantly.  I
    used to randomly see my fonts on the front page about as often as anyone else.  Now,
    I have not seen them there at all.  I am not saying anything is amiss, perhaps
    there have been so many new people that the odds are far less.  I do see some
    fonts there more frequently than the odds would seem right.

    that.\r\n\r\nBTW, this maneuvering seems quite revealing. If Mono/Lino\r\ndid
    indeed pull out of MyFonts because they thought they were\r\nlosing too much to
    MF's cut (maybe they assumed people buy\r\ntheir fonts \"with intent\", as opposed
    to \"running into\" them on\r\nplaces like MyFonts; or maybe they underestimated
    people's\r\ncomfort with shopping at MF) but then they came around to\r\nbuy MF,
    they must have noticed a marked drop is sales in the\r\ninterim. Which means MF
    really works. I guess $50M sort of\r\nindicates that too...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
