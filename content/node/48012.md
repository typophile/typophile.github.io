    Fonts</a> library. They do that style very well.

  body: "They are obviously based on traditional late 19th & early 20th Century pub
    signs, etched or gold-leafed on glass & mirrors. It could be that they were done
    by someone who makes & restores those. It might be worth checking here: [[http://www.handletteringforum.com/forum/|The
    Hand Lettering Forum]].\r\n\r\nA couple of the UK specialists in this work, Arthur
    Vanson & Dave Smith, have designed fonts for Letterhead Fonts."
