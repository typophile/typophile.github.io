body: Was reading through Rookledge's Type Finder and came across this typeface. I'm
  simply curious if it's ever been digitized and if not, why not? It looks like a
  decent face.

    Type</a> lists a Paganini by A. Butti/R. Bertieri \u2013 made before 1935 for
    Societ\xE0 Nebiolo \u2013 and claims there was also a digital version (\u2018PS\u2019,
    next to \u2018B\u2019 for Blei = lead and \u2018F\u2019 for Fototype).\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, it\u2019s not about <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/p/paganini.htm\">this
    Paganini</a>.\r\n\r\nFor those who want to take a look at a sample of Paganini:

  body: I see the claim there, but I'm just curious if anyone's ever actually *seen*
    it. Thanks for the PDF though! That's a great sample of Butti's work. Oh, and
    I found the other Paganini quite quickly, which is why I specified Butti.

  body: "Hi Alex. The Paganini typeface is featured on most of the Nebiolo specimens
    I\u2019ve seen. Giangiorgio Fuga has put online some pictures from one of his
    copies of said specimens, like <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/giofuga/1755025881/in/set-72157602712967666/\">this
    picture where you can see Paganini quite well</a>. \r\n\r\nAccording to <cite>20
    alfabeti brevemente illustrati</cite> (1933) by Raffaello Bertieri, the typeface
    was his own creation. He art directed and drew the first preliminar sketches while
    Alessandro Butti did most of the actual drawing of the typeface itself. It\u2019s
    a well regarded typeface if you consider that even Giovanni Mardersteig has been
    known to use it."

    very well drawn I thought you could consider it too \"artsy\".\r\nWhat do you
    mean by \"non-literal\"? Are you using it as a staring point?"

  body: For Hrant I think it isn't an aesthetically related epithet. When he has used
    the term in the past it had to do with his sense of the intent of the type maker.
    If the choices ( florid or no ) were in his eyes aimed at better reading then
    they were craft. If not, artsy as in for personal expression. The modern/Bodoni
    look is the aesthetic that I have seen Hrant attracted to over time. Fleischmann
    & Paganini both have it. Hrant, feel free to correct this if it is mistaken.

    by Raffaello Bertieri, since many of them seem more interested in recovery of
    historical letters within a "romantic" conception.

  body: "Ruano is basically an upright cancelleresca, systematized into a typeface.\r\nBy
    \"black\" Antonio means that's pretty heavy in weight, I think, compared to the
    cancelleresca calligraphy. I have the original specimen of Ruano, and although
    I don't like so much the lowercase it is undoubtedly an original typeface, even
    more, considered it was designed in 1926.\r\nI was incredibly surprised to see
    some uppercase forms I have incorporated into my old Exegetic are amazingly similar
    to Ruano (the uppercase R and S, the lowercase S).\r\nI think - willingly or not
    - these forms got in the blood of us Italians, even if the faces were maybe not
    so extensively used (Ruano was not so ubiquitous as Paganini or Semplicit\xE0)."

    any sort of blackletter sensibility at play, but I admit my knowledge of these
