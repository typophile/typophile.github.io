body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font to use for a design job. The client
  sells handcrafted designer products, bought from small artisan workshops, family
  businesses, flea markets, designers and craftsmen around the world. Things like
  handmade candles, wicker, leather chests, fragrances, etc. Modern versions of very
  traditional products.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm looking for a font to use that is mostly modern,
  but with a slight hint of something exotic.. something reminiscent of Tintin books,
  the Orient Express, romantic adventures in far off lands, possibly a bit North African...?\r\n\r\nSorry
  if that's pretty vague! Hopefully someone here can help, I've been searching high
  and low.\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\nNick"

  body: "This may be an odd suggestion: \"Smart Casual\" by Scholtz. \r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/smart-casual/\r\n\r\nThe
    designer's description is \"relaxed elegance,\" suitable for party invitations
    and such. But to me, it looks modern yet slightly exotic. The designer often does
    African-inspired fonts, maybe that's why. It seems to fit no pigeonhole. I bought
    this on impulse, but haven't yet found the perfect use for it. "

    - has a little exotic twang to it that might be just enough"
