  The concept of the disc revolves around poisonous places, and the idea of abscence
  in the space. I am looking to set the type preferably using one type family.\r\nDo
  you have any suggestions as to what to go for? I was thinking about a sans serif
  that is fresh, but flexible to different type treatments when setting the lyrics.
  \r\n\r\nThanks already,"
