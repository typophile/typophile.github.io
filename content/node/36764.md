  to become acquainted with fonts for a business name.  For a numbers person I have
  realized the uses, types, and presentations are larger than I realized.\r\n\r\nI
  have a small business that specializes in backoffice work or data tracking in the
  oil and gas industry.  Trusts, individuals, and attorneys are areas I have gained
  work.  My business name is \u201COildat\u201D.  I have browsed the Parsine and Daxline
  fonts yet I am unsure how the short name presents.  Assurance, trust, yet modern
  or upbeat is a few meaning I would like to convey in the font and name.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas, suggestions or a direction you could point me would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you again for providing a great atmosphere for learning.\r\nMichael\r\n  "

    will let you \"preview\" short text passages (a word or two) in any font(s) you
    find, giving you a better idea of what your logotype would look like.\r\n"

    so, I'd suggest a designer. Many will give you \"unlimited revisions\", so your
    satisfaction is practically guaranteed. \r\n\r\nSeriously though, they can make
    some subtle tweaks, even to simple words that make it work better. Some portfolios
    could probably be suggested to find someone whose work you admire."

  body: "Thank you for your suggestions.  Yes, in particular the font was for a business
    name logo.  Previewing the name on MyFonts has made it easier to visualize.  \r\nI
    had narrowed the search to fonts for the company name.  Was it lack of creativity
    or remembrance of font type logos that leave impressions?\r\n\r\nYes, threads
    on designers and websites I have tended to follow as I feel I'm out of my field.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
    again!\r\n"
