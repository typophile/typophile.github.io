  body: ' Hi RodrigoRam&iacute;rez <BR> <BR>imo this is a great Serif Font! <BR> <BR>okay
    here my critic: <BR> <BR>the lc &#39;b&#39; is &#40;maybe only on the gif&#41;
    not really on the baseline <BR>the stem of the lc &#39;f&#39; seems to be a little
    bolder then other stems maybe also lc &#39;l&#39; <BR> <BR>at the right stem of
    the lc &#39;n&#39; and middle stem of the &#39;m&#39; whats that a the bottom?
    I see it is a flavor mmh.. but i dont like it much <BR> <BR>The lc &#39;z&#39;
    looks &#39;left-italic&#39; &#40;maybe it is the gif&#41; <BR> <BR>Greetings Jens '

  body: ' First, I would say this is essentially a sans face. Those occasional flare
    serifs remind of Profile. I would emphasize them, because it will pull the design
    away from the overcrowded pool of humanist sans fonts that we&#39;re drowning
    in. <BR> <BR>It looks like a pretty functional design. The only lc glyph that&#39;s
    strange is the &#34;g&#34;: I&#39;d make the head not so tall, and make the tail
    open. But many of the curves are &#34;wobbly&#34;, like in the lc &#34;s&#34;
    - this is your biggest quality issue, to me. And I see that you have some trapping
    &#40;like in the lc &#34;w&#34;&#41;, which is fine, but leave that until after
    you&#39;ve finished the base forms. <BR> <BR>The caps are pretty interesting.
    Put flares on the &#34;C&#34; and the &#34;T&#34;, make the head of the &#34;P&#34;
    larger, and the tail of the &#34;Q&#34; thinner but longer. It would be nice to
    see some all-caps text. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve heard that the Florin has to always
    slant, and I think the Pilcrow needs a dark patch: it has to stand out. Your accents
    are smaller than usual, but to be honest I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s bad &#40;and
    it depends on the language&#41;... <BR> <BR>hhp '
