    you're trying to get across and how the font will specifically be used. But if
    you're looking for a lovely substitute for Trajan that evokes a similar mood,
    try Requiem from HFJ.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sorry for being so vague, the poster needs to a have a New York City feeling
    that is contemporary, bold and interesting. Requiem is a great suggestion! A few
    others that were lobbed my way are Utopia bold and Alinea-roman. Going to give
    them all a try now. Thanks again.\r\n\r\n.amp"
