  a symbol above the wordmark later on. What do you think? Thanks guys.

  body: "Scripts with such character don't really need a mark, IMO. \r\n\r\nI'm not
    really the one to give advice (I'm usually the amateur in need of it), but I'd
    still like to mention a few things here: \r\nFirst and foremost it doesn't strike
    me as consistent. Maybe figuring out the skeleton and using a single tool to draw
    it out before you start finetuning the outlines will be helpful.\r\nSecond, I'm
    having problems recognizing some characters, most notably 'g' and 'k'."

  body: "Hi frode frank, thanks for the feedback. \r\n\r\nThe script is based from
    my handwriting that I scanned in. Would you be able to point out an example of
    the inconsistency? I have tried really hard to align everything.\r\nI'm not sure
    on this point but I am thinking that the illegibility on some letters could also
    make it unique and more memorable. What do you think? :)"

  body: "Interesting. I like it. \r\n\r\nThe \"g\" looks like \"z with an ascender\"
    to me. I think you need to separate \"i\" and \"g\". Letter \"c\" also need some
    refinement."

  body: Compare the 'd' stem to 'h' and 'k'. Also the bowl on 'd', 'e' and 'c'. The
    endings on 's' vs 'c'. That said, I like the general feel, and I think you are
    moving in the right direction.

  body: "thanks for the feedback guys, it is interesting to read that you guys like
    this approach, I liked it too... Although responses on a couple of other forums
    have been negative. \r\nI think I need to experiment with other ideas. I'll post
    up any updates on the logo. :)"

  body: I don't know why, but I'm reading the `ee' as `ec', perhaps because they are
    too different. Also, the `c' at the start of the word `check' is quite large,
    and looks a little of place (it reads somehow like `designCheek'). The `d' also
    connects with the following `e' at a strange angle. Other than that, I like it!
