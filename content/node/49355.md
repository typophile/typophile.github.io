  body: You might want to figure out a different solution for aleph... given that
    the usual users of that alphabet sometimes have a very high sensitivity to a certain
    symbol. Just saying.

  body: It's true. I designed aleph before the triangular bricks were added to fontstruct.
    I'm going to change it in these days. Do you read and write hebrew? Tell me if
    you find more mistakes

  body: It might just be my monitor, but there's something going on with the straight
    diagonals, like the legs of the A.

  body: That's an artifact of Fontstruct. I think the rendering on the site is still
    done with the separate blocks intact, so the slope isn't a continuous line. If
    that effect carried through to the finished font, it would mean the angles on
    those blocks don't match, which I hope would be too big a blunder to expect of
    FontShop.

  body: Yes, it's true In the site it works with separate blocks. But when you use
    the font in Illustrator, for example, the final outline makes a continuous line.
