  it is possible to print out an entire font library? I am am currently using font
  explorer x, and also have font book. Do either of these programs have this function?
  Does anyone know any that do?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\n\r\nGraham"

    Fontbook</a> will print a variety of samples although it seems to have trouble
    with proper letterspacing.  I haven't used it in some time.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Most font managers have a print function. The problem is that they are too
    simple, giving the same treatment to every style of every family. Creating something
    truly useful takes a lot of organization and formatting work. Unless you have
    a lot of free fonts, I recommend <a href="http://fontbook.com">FontBook</a> as
    a reference. The $99 is probably worth the time you'd spend on getting it right.

    get FontBook on the company coffers as he's got a little more shove than me. And
    they've got a little more money...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: "I used Veenix Font Tools to great success for printing out roughly 1,400
    fonts for use as sample books at a college art department. You can print 10/page
    (two lines), 20/page (1 line), 40/page (1 line, 2 columns), cascade (6 pt. through
    44 pt.), smaller cascade + body sample (at 10/12), and an ASCII reference sheet.
    You can customize what the lines say, too. It handled opentype, postscript, and
    truetype fonts equally well. My procedure:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Deactivate all fonts
    possible in FontExplorer X.</li>\r\n<li>Activate Veenix. Categorize all remaining
    active fonts as \u201CSystem\u201D or whatever tag works for you. (create the
    tag first, then go to Actions&#8594;Categorize All Fonts in Current Sort As&#8594;)</li>\r\n<li>Group
    fonts into historical/stylistic categories in FE X if you haven't. I would do
    this if you have more than a couple hundred fonts. Veenix leaks a bit and will
    start making mistakes after parsing several hundred.</li>\r\n<li>Activate only
    the set I wanted to print in FE X, deactivate all other fonts.</li>\r\n<li>Restart
    Veenix.</li>\r\n<li>Flush the font database in Veenix (command-K) which forces
    it to only index the active fonts.</li> \r\n<li>In the Current Sort option, select
    \"Uncategorized fonts\" (to filter out system fonts).</li>\r\n<li>Open the type
    book creator in Veenix (command-6).</li>\r\n<li>Set it up as needed.</li>\r\n<li>Click
    print all.</li>\r\n<li>Instead of printing, save as .pdf.</li>\r\n<li>Print .pdfs
    via Acrobat.</li> \r\n</ol>\r\nAll in all, it went pretty smoothly. I customized
    my two lines (I used the 10 fonts per page option) and separated the fonts into
    three largish books: Serif, Sans, Display/etc. Each book had subcategories: Serif
    had Venetian, Garalde, Transitional, Didone, Egyptian. Sans had humanist, grotesque,
    geometric. Display/etc. had Headlines, Blackletter, Handwritten, Brushscript,
    Calligraphic Script, Chiseled Stroke, Non-Western, Pi/Symbol, and Misc. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    this is way too much info, but perhaps it will help you too\u2026 I hope the latter.\r\n\r\nOh,
    here\u2019s the site.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veenix.com/FontTools.html\r\n\r\n\u2014Matt
