body: "I intend to use MVB Embarcadero for a personal Atlas/Cartography-related project.
  It will be a kind of alternative mapping, but I want it to in style reference conventional
  atlases/maps, yet give it a new direction. Embarcadero is the base font but I would
  like to use a serif next to it, for contrast. I will probably use it both for labeling
  and some (short) text, so it should hold up well on a busier background. In common
  Atlases there often is a combination of Helvetica/Clarendon or Venus/Rhoemisch.
  I like this kind of modern/classical pairing but as I said I want to make my own
  new interpretation of it.\r\n\r\nI've been looking at fonts like Century (too conventional),
  Walbaum (too thin), Charter (nice, but does it combine well?) and URW Latino (too
  little contrast)...\r\n\r\nAny ideas? "

  body: What about Sentinel?  It's kind of an updated, more versatile Clarendon that
    might work really nicely with Embarcadero.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions Nick and Trevor, I appreciate it. Sentinel steys
    a bit too close to Clarendon, IMHO. It's a nice face, but not quite what I'm looking
    for. \r\n\r\nStill looking... tried various options; not neccesarily because of
    a stilistic or historical link, but more to find a nice contrast. I tried Calluna,
    Droid Serif and Slimbach, which all have a decent x-height, and a certain calligraphic
    flair to them. I'm not too sure though if it works. I will try some more combos,
    also in the Century vain.\r\n\r\nIf you have some more pointers I would be very
    grateful!"

    beautiful and warm, an interesting face somewhere between a Century and a Didone.
    \ I don't know how it would pair with Embarcadero, but it might be worth a shot
    at least.\r\n"

    and  there are different widths available. The family seems to be relatively calm
    and descent, they call it a blended scotch.\r\n\r\nOr, different meat, FF Meta
    Serif, the \"g\" might be too offensive, but i would give it a try. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
