body: "There was a study a little while back that looked at which parts of (Latin)
  letters are most relevant for letter recognition. IIRC this was achieved by obscuring
  various parts of letters and then checking how much that harmed recognition. I can
  distinctly remember there were (greyscale, somewhat blurry) images of at least all
  the lowercase letters with their most relevant parts highlighted / least relevant
  parts barely visible. But that\u2019s all I remember (I didn\u2019t actually read
  it yet), and I can\u2019t find it anymore. \r\nDoes anyone know what I\u2019m talking
  about, and can point me towards a source? Thanks!"

  body: "In his <em>Manuale Typografico</em> (Manual of Typography) of 1818 Bodoni
    wrote on page XXV:\r\n\xABOve per\xF2 buona ragion non appaja, e la moda non tiranna
    lasci arbitrio, il bon gusto si attiene a una semplecit\xE0 non rozza, quale si
    mostrerebbe delineando con tratti per tutto egualemente grossi le lettere, ma
    ben avvisata e gentile, quale scorgesi nel bel contrasto per dir cos\xEC di chiari
    e scuri; che vien naturale a ogni scrito di ben tagliata penna e ben tenuta in
    mano.\xBB\r\n\r\nIn English this may translate into:\r\n\u201CExcellent simplicity,
    which should not be understood in such a way that the strokes of the characters
    should be of equal thickness, should decently and gracefully show the beautiful
    contrast of light and shade <em>(thin and thick)</em>, like a well-cut and well-handled
    pen lends it to the script.\u201D\r\n\r\nA few lines further Bodoni continues
    in a similar manner:\r\n\u201CPrinting, which was invented to replace handwriting,
    becomes perfect the more it resembles the most beautiful manuscripts.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn
    the next paragraph (p. XXVII) he says:\r\n\u201CThe beauty of a typeface is founded
    (\u2026) on the ease of the strokes, on their freedom, decisiveness and fluency.\u201D\r\n\r\nNote
    that  in the foreword of his <em>Manuale</em>, Bodoni does not write a single
    sentence on circles and rectangles, let alone architecture. Seen in this context,
    I wonder if Didot really was the architect as suggested by Deberny et Peignot
    in their text on Bifur: \u201C\u2026 the conception of Didot, who first had the
    hardihood so worthy of admiration, of deliberately renouncing the imitation of
    handwriting and of creating capital letters formed of  heavy black and light strokes.
    He constructed in place of designing; the architect in him took the place of the
    calligrapher.\r\n\r\nReading this and comparing it to Bodoni\u2019s words, I wonder
    what Didot himself has said about the characteristics of his typefaces. Anyone?"

  body: "When reading the aforementioned research papers, I think that the researchers
    may have been preoccupied by the idea that we only look at the black shapes. When
    analyzing their results on identification of the lower case letters of Arial,
    I think one could argue that for the identification of a,c, e and i, maybe even
    of s and z, we are rather looking for the existence of white counters and check
    wether they have an aperture or not. In the case of s and z, we maybe look for
    the way the two counters are separated from each other. When we look at the parts
    where the other letters are being recognized, it is my observation that these
    parts are all thick strokes in conventional serif typeface design. No matter wether
    they are Old Style / Garalde or Modern / Didonic). Which would imply that when
    we are identifying single letters, we are in fact looking for the counters and
    the thick strokes of a conventional serif typeface (which Courier is not \u2026).
    The only group for which this does not seem to apply is that of the characters
    with diagonals and also do not have an ascender or descender; namely v, w and
    x. \r\n[Edit] Note that in the left column of the Arial lower case table, there
    is a slight focus on the upper end of the right diagonal stroke of k and v \u2026
    The (position of) the upper end of that stroke seems to be a valuable indicator.
    When one blurs the image of a traditional serif typeface, the right diagonal stroke(s)
    of  will look similar to the right half of the image of these letters in the left
    column \u2026\r\n\r\nWhen trying to validate the outcome of this research for
    typeface design, I think we should consider that the investigation on Arial mainly
    tells us a lot about Arial. To be shure about what we do when reading Frutiger,
    one should research Frutiger with the same method. For what we do when reading
    Garamond, Swift or Bodoni, we should check these typefaces as well. Both for single
    letter recognition and for words and texts. When it comes to typeface design,
    this kind of research may become interesting when we know wether we look at different
    features per typeface or if we will always look for the \u2018same\u2019 features.
    I think we will also have to consider that some researchers suggest that \u2018tuning
    in\u2019 to a typeface is an essential part of an effective reading process. The
    \u2018Arial research project\u2019 does not tackle this effect (please correct
    when you think I am mistaken). As far as I remember, the research methods of Matthew
    Carter and Kevin Larson on Georgia and Sitka were quite different. I think it
    would be very interesting to see if their findings relate to the outcome of the
    research by Fiset,  Gosselin etc."
