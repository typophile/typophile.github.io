body: "I've been using Scala for a while now, and I'm pleased with it. It is a phenomenally
  clear and legible face. Very comfortable and inviting, thanks to the generous x-height
  and moderate colour, among other things. It seems that Scala and Scala Sans can
  be used for almost anything, but I use the former for lengthy tracts of text, and
  the latter for occasional heading/subheading use.  \r\n\r\nI've recently seen some
  samples of StormType Andulka. Its x-height seems generous as well, and its form
  also appears especially clear and readable.\r\n\r\nCan anyone provide a bit of insight
  about how Andulka might perform on the printed page (as opposed to Scala) at 11-12
  pt., 600dpi? \r\n"
