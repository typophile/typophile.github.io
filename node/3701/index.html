  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">How does one calculate appropriate licensing fees for broadcast? Specifically a network television sitcom using freeware fonts for opening credits? <BR> <BR>Both MTV's The Osbournes and CBS's Still Standing are using my freeware fonts primarily in the main title sequences of both shows. <BR> <BR>In the case of The Osbournes, the font usage has spilled out into licensed merchandise and continues to grow the brand based upon my work. <BR> <BR>I'm usually not a stickler about licensing nor am I trying to be greedy and take money out of the franchise. I do however feel that if a major network is going to use a typeface as the basis of the brand of the show that they would attempt to compensate the typeface creator by acquiring the appropriate licensing for the font. <BR> <BR>While it is truly flattering and I'm excited to see the fonts in use so notibly, no attempts to contact me have been made by either network. <BR> <BR>I open it up to the group to offer any advice, opions, or suggestions as to what would be fair compensation for the usage. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the ear, <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had contacted MTV but they were not at all responsive and frankly I don't have the $$$ to sick a lawyer on them. <BR> <BR>You are correct, there are no specific terms in my freeware licensing that would protect the fonts from use without some commercial license in place. <BR> <BR>Other thoughts that I had entertained were to revised the license on my freeware faces to include something to the effect of if it's used for broadcast the Font Diner must be credited or a commercial license must be purchased. <BR> <BR>If I tell people they must purchase a commercial license for commercial use, I'll get a ton of e-mail from individuals wanting to use it on their business cards and websites. Those aren't the folks I am concenred with as much as I am a major network or company. <BR> <BR>Another great suggestion I received was to create a &quot;pro&quot; version of the fonts and release them as commercial quality at either my site or My Fonts. Right now, the fonts were done very early in my font making career and are quite techincally poor quality. <BR> <BR>Perhaps it would encourage people to pay up for the better versions. Not becuase I intended it that way by releasing a lower quality first font, but becuase the older version is really quite horrid. <BR> <BR>Stuart</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While 'threaten' may be too strong a word, I  <BR>agree. You have to make it absolutely clear  <BR>they're dealing with the Font Diner 'legal' or  <BR>'licensing department' and not with Stuart  <BR>Sandler, the small-beans, nice guy, type  <BR>designer. <BR> <BR>Here's an approach: <BR> <BR>Write a letter (from your Font Diner licensing  <BR>dept.) saying you're aware they're using the  <BR>fonts in violation of the licensing agreement.  <BR>Attach an invoice to the letter. No confrontation  <BR>or name-calling necessary. It gives them the  <BR>benefit of the doubt and doesn't paint you as a  <BR>pushover. <BR> <BR>Then if they don't pay it, you'll have more  <BR>ground to call a lawyer or seek legal action. <BR> <BR>Good luck with it.

It wasn't until this discussion I transitioned my Silverware library to TT only and the end user needed to buy the commercial license of the face to get the PS version and the license. <BR> <BR>By the way Joe, I took your suggestion but sent 'em an invoice and it eventually was paid. Not by MTV or the production company who did the titling, but by the artist who designed the credits because font licensing was his responsibility to MTV. <BR> <BR>Oh well, the license expires each season, so if I see the faces used come fall, you can bet another invoice will be showing up in MTV's mailbox. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>
