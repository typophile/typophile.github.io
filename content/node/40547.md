    3-weight <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">La Peruta family</a> from the long defunct Casady & Greene.
    Outlining the bold weight, Andrew, might get you there."

    that is another digitization of Arpad.\r\n\r\nMike's method of making the outline
    font should work fine.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
