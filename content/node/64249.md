body: hopefully this post isn't too off-topic for this forum, but I'm looking for
  inspiration to create a really clean, modern dentist website. google searches have
  turned up nothing inspiring whatsoever, so I wonder if anyone knows of any good
  sites off-hand? thanks!

  body: "American dentists rarely spend more than 1000 dollars to make their website.
    Since having a listing on 1800-dentist or local directories yield better return.
    If you really want to find reference online you should spend your time on sites
    specialize in plastic surgery. \r\n\r\nIf you really want to see good \"dentist\"
    sites, don't waste your time on American sites. Swiss or Japanese site are superior.
    Here are some random local directories for them.\r\n\r\n(Tokyo)\r\nhttp://www.shikaiin.com/tokyoto/shinjyuku.htm

  body: Yes it is a sweetener, but it is a good one, unlike sugar. So it tastes good
    and using chewing gum or pastilles with xylitol prevents of dental caries and
    ear infections. http://www.leaf.fi/information/what-is-xylitol

    I stumble upon has clearly been designed from a template... I suppose I didn't

  body: "Might I suggest thinking of private practice medical websites as part of
    the larger category of \"brochure\" websites. Even the websites of small retailers
    -- jewelry, handbags, etc -- might be relevant.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, the difficult
    part of designing a medical site is the sourcing of appropriate photography. If
    you get the right photographs, you will be halfway there."

  body: "dirtcastle,\r\n\r\nthe photography issue has been the key challenge for me.
    my client wants a site which doesn't use much photography (a relief; aren't we
    all sick of airbrushed, hysterically happy, smiling people?), so i was really
    hoping to find at least a few examples of that, but it seems that not a one exists.
    since my first post i have resorted to looking to other industry websites like
    you suggested. thanks for your help!\r\n\r\nwt"

  body: "No doubt... airbrushed, smiley stock art is cringe-inducing, especially of
    the canned, stock variety.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's damn near impossible to
    make a compelling medical site without some good photography. That's one of the
    resons why I feel the \"90210\" site is so good... because he has pics of real
    patients. My orthodontist used to have pics of patients on the wall of his office/laboratory
    and everybody was always checkin out the pics on the wall.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes
    to art/photography, I try to heavily engage my client in the process. Sometimes
    they are game, sometimes not. But it may be the only way to avoid those cringes.
    This very issue -- needing quality, authentic photos -- was one of the main reasons
    I started learning photography."
