  I am turning to you lovely, talented folk. \r\n\r\nI am attempting to identify the
  font used in \"chunky\" in [[http://blog.dingbatpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/MY_Option1BC_tags.png|this]]
  image and in the bottom iteration of [[http://blog.dingbatpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/441_AmandaB_RI_Option1_.jpg|this]]
  image. I am starting to believe perhaps it is a customized version of a pre-existing
  font, or maybe my Google-fu is just incredibly far off lately. Either way, maybe
  someone else has an idea? \r\n\r\n(Design credit: [[http://www.dingbatpress.com|Dingbat
