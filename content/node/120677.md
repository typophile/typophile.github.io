  body: "Odd combination of a box squared sans, slanted that uses the distinctive
    step serifs found in Dynamo https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/dynamo-lt/
    Note that _AIFE_ are a match.\r\nSeems to be yet another example of a logo maker
    taking a rather good font and mangling it. I prefer Dynamo before the boxing treatment.\r\nDon"
