  Here's the font in question in two contexts. The first being the bottom left-hand
  typeface of the address:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.blogohblog.com/wp-content/pop/2007/10/candrascott.gif\"></img>\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://www.atomicmall.com/cpic/22/36695-1268973690.jpg\"></img>\r\n\r\nI feel
  like I've seen this a lot before, but I only made the connection upon seeing the
  business card and then looking at my watch. \r\n\r\nAppreciate the help!"
