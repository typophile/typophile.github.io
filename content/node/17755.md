    www is my very favorite. Well done. There is something about the pattern Cooper
    creates, as in this ligature -- chunky, squishy, soft and a quite lovable. Looks
    a bit like something you could rest on. :)\r\n\r\nAs I said in the Franklin Gothic
    Swash battle, I really enjoy seeing those entries which have the potential of
    working quite well in the existing typeface (which is what I consider to be one
    of the most important factors in this battle). \r\n\r\nz"

  body: "Hey Duncan, just a tip for ya! When you create ligatures the area of combined
    strokes should only be as heavy (weight-wise) as a single stroke. Ligature does
    mean 'joined' but if you look at a standard \xE6 lig it looks like it's just one
    stroke down the middle that is both the right side of the a glyph and left side
    of the e glyph. Your ligatures right now for the most part are doubly wide where
    they join. It draws the eye directly to that part of the combination because it
    is optically darker than the rest. Take a look at some of the other examples and
    I think you'll see what I'm saying! :-D Of course I'm no expert, just trying to
    help!"
