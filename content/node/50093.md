  body: Thanks I enjoyed listening to this program. It is fascinating to hear experts
    describe the rich ferment of translation, scholarship and enlightened research
    in Baghdad and other Arab and Islamic cities a thousand years ago. They called
    it 'the first Renaissance' because it was a direct cause of the Renaissance in
    Europe a few centuries later. It was interesting how many non-Moslems were active
    in the translation movement from Greek to Arabic. A parallel to that today would
    be how some non-Arabs are active and even pioneers in Arabic typography! Right,
    John?
