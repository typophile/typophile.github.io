  body: ".null -- properly \u2018NULL\u2019, but lots of people use .null to no ill
    effect -- should be zero-width.\r\n\r\nCR should be the same width as your \u2018space\u2019
    glyph.\r\n\r\nWill anything break if you don't set these widths correctly? Probably
    not, but one can't be sure.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can't be sure that something
    won't break if you set the widths correctly, either; but you can be sure that
    it isn't your fault."

    is the CR's width used? What if it's too wide or too narrow? What effect would
    a zero width CR have?\r\n\r\nIs the NULL being zero width really important? What
    if it has a width? What effect does it really have?\r\n\r\nKnowing this sort of
    thing could be useful in tracking down bugs."

  body: "The problem is, \"the actual effect\" can be very difficult to track down.
    There are tens of thousands of font-consuming apps on a wide variety of operating
    platforms and you don't always have control of which of those apps are going to
    use your font. While many of these will use system-provided text rendering, some
    don't. Some will have certain expectations about the width and glyph content of
    these characters, some won't.\r\n\r\nTo give a few actual examples related to
    this: \r\n- I once dealt with a customer who was having trouble getting a certain
    character to render. It worked fine in one application but not in another. It
    turns out the character in question was encoded to the non-breaking space (U+00A0).
    Now, you're not really supposed to put glyph data in there, but for some reason
    the font in question had it. It turned out the \"problem\" app was ignoring glyph
    data (including width) for U+00A) (it just used the same advance from space/U+0020),
    while some other apps used it.\r\n\r\n- Line breaks of an allegedly monospaced
    font were inconsistent between regular and bold weights in one app. The glyphs
    were all on the same advance, except for the fact that the CR was a different
    width in the bold weight. Testing in the usual suspects didn't uncover this problem
    but in the problem app, the CR width entered the calculation for line breaks (this
    was before the days of Font Validator and other testing platforms which would
    have saved a lot of trouble).\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experience is: if you enjoy wasting
    a lot of time tracking down difficult-to-reproduce bugs whose symptoms may be
    unrelated to the actual problem, you should ignore convention and do stuff like
    give the NULL glyph a non-zero advance width, or set the CR to something other
    than the space or stuff along these lines. Planned experiments aside, I don't
    like doing that, so I follow convention unless there's a very clear and demonstrable
    benefit to doing so.\r\n"

  body: "I've experienced the CR vs space discrepancy in monospaced fonts problem.
    \r\n\r\nYeah, well obviously \"don't make errors\" is always a good idea but I
    was wondering if anyone has noticed any other specific problems caused by incorrect
    widths on blank glyphs. I'm not trying to find out why I shouldn't make incorrect
    blank glyphs buy trying to shed light on the consequences to make these problems
    easier to isolate.\r\n\r\nA kind-of-related example: I received an email from
    someone who was working on their first font. It worked fine in some apps but in
    Adobe apps, the space appeared as a question mark. I knew right away that the
    problem was the space was named incorrectly. Abode cares about the name \"space\"
    being correct and most other apps don't. So having knowledge about how various
    apps react to non-standard fonts can help when it comes to tracking down font
    problems."

  body: "Yes, \"don't make errors\" is always a great idea, but few of us are that
    lucky or blessed. In fact, I'd say no one is. That's where validation tools such
    as Adobe's compareFamily and Microsoft Font Validator (and other tools) can really
    help...they run tons of consistency checks amongst various font values and can
    help spot oddities, bad situations, and outright errors before bad fonts ever
    go out the door...obviating the need for worry about what a given app does with
    oddly-made data.\r\n\r\nI follow what you're getting at, and it's true that having
    application-specific knowledge of these things can help diagnose problems. But
    if one of the variables is bad or weird font data, it's probably going to result
    in fixing the font anyway, so it kinda doesn't matter what the app is doing with
    that (bad) data. I would question the value of a list of stuff like, \"this font
    bug makes BigCo's Awesome App do crazy stuff\". We do maintain a list of *application*
    bugs (or what we think are bugs, or strange behaviors), but that list is fairly
    short. Most of the font-related problems we encounter can eventually be tracked
    back to bad or at least odd font data (surprise, surprise)...and very few cases
    are things that didn't show up in validation tools.\r\n"
