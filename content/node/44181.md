  if anyone has any suggestions of museums, studios, print shops, clubs, etc. relating
  to type, typography, printing history, letterpress, book arts, etc. either in Mexico
  City itself or nearby that I should check out.\r\n\r\n(Dining suggestions are also
  welcome!)\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\nGrendl.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Designer/scholar Marina Garone has put together two exhibits about the history
    of women printers in Mexico. These shows are in Puebla, a great place to visit
    anyway. I was just in Mexico City but did not get to Puebla (about an hour\u2019s
    bus ride from Mexico City\u2019s TAPO or Tasquena bus terminals; also direct to
    & from the airport). Here\u2019s her description of the shows:\r\n\r\nWe also
    invite you to visit the Antique Book Exhibition: \u201CThe Other\r\nLetters: Woman
    Printers in the Palafoxiana Library\u201D, in the City of\r\nPuebla, open until
    March 2009. The exhibition \u201C: \u201CThe Other Letters:\r\nWoman Printers
    in the Lafragua Library\u201D, also in the City of Puebla is\r\nopen until June
    of this year and has an online version:\r\nhttp://www.buap.mx/impresoras/\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s
    a printing museum in Mexico City but I don\u2019t know where it is.\r\n\r\nIf
    you dig calligraphy, head to the history museum at Chapultepec. There see a wonderful
    18th-c calligraphic painting of a gentleman on horseback. The gent is painted
    in the style of the time, but his mount\u2019s body is rendered in white calligraphic
    swirls and spirals. It is one of my favorite paintings. I saw it 25 years ago,
    and last month it was just as wonderful as the first time. When at Chapultepec,
    also see the Juan O\u2019Gorman murals of Mexican history. Then go to the Zocalo
    and get a guided tour of the Diego Rivera murals in the Palacio Nacional. Same
    story, same characters, wonderfully different painting styles.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s
    also a printing museum in Mexico City, but I do not know where it is. \r\n\r\nHave
    breakfast at El Morro at the corner of Lazaro Cardenas & Uruguay, near downtown.
    Dinner at Fonda El Refugio, Liverpool 166, near metro stop Insurgentes. Somewhere
    in Zona Rosa is an Argentine restaurant called Blu, with wonderful Argentine sausage
    and excellent margaritas. I was not taking notes about its location; we just wandered
    by and sat down; sorry.\r\n\r\nHave fun; you\u2019ll be in a wonderful city. ATypI
    has announced its 2009 meeting will be in Mexico City.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n"
