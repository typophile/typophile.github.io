  would be much appreciative. It was a specimen used on some Whitney Museum communication
  about 5 years ago (pre Experimental Jetset re-brand). It could be an old grotesque,
  although by the look of the lower-case 'a', it could be something more contemporary.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nC[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample_2_4392.jpg]"
