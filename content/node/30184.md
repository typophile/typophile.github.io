body: I'm curious to know what versions of Gill Sans are available. (I don't mean
  all the wacky variations.) I'm curious because Gill Sans is such a ubiquitous face
  - are all the Gill Sans I'm seeing the same as available from Monotype, Linotype,
  Adobe, etc? Or do Gills Sans fonts vary from foundry to foundry?

    trademark would be doing so under their authority/license. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

  body: So you're saying that all normally available digital fonts called Gill Sans
    should conform to Monotype's digitized version?

    that have been various one-offs made for different technologies that diverge from
    the norm.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Patrick, when you say <em>all the Gill Sans I\u2019m seeing...</em> which
    ones are you looking at?\r\n\r\nSimon's right about the creation of various one-offs,
    but this is not done just for technological reasons. There may be as many versions
    of Gill Sans as there are large-scale corporate customers who use it as a house
    face. For instance, Saab's corporate ID specifies Gill Sans just as the BBC does,
    but I'd be surprised if the agencies servicing those accounts haven't customised
    the fonts specifically, so there will be variations. It's not uncommon to open
    up a font folder in a commercial studio and see 'agency cuts' of very well-known
    fonts like this. Sometimes they include logos and marks specific to the client
    brands.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Monotype themselves used to make a (Postscript
    Type 3) version of GS that had an alternate numeral 1 that could be recognised
    apart from the uppercase I and the lowercase l. Back in the days of metal typesetting
    this version had a 'f' in front of the series number. I think this convention
    disappeared when the font got issued as a Postscript Type 1 from the Adobe/Linotype
    libraries, but you'd have to check with the foundries themselves about this."

    different from Monotype's version, but i don't think it is available any more.

    first bought my Type 1 - directly from Monotype (back in the days when they were
    the only manufacturer who held the legal rights) I paid over $900 for the family.
    They promised me that they would never sell the family to Adobe for mass distribution.\r\n\r\nSeveral
    years later, not only did Adobe have the rights from them to produce it for all
    -- but they even packaged it with their Illustrator 5.5 as a bonus!\r\n\r\nI don't
    think I've ever forgave Monotype. \r\n\r\nBut then again, so many of the original
    typesetting equipment manufacturers felt the \"come around, go around\" -- \r\n\r\nThank
    you."

    of Gill Sans; it may be the Berthold 'cut' you are referring to.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notgillsans_6190.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo,
    to answer the original question, yes, here is a case of Gill Sans produced by
    a different foundry and appearing quite radically different as a result.\r\n\r\nTim's
    right to point out the difference of width in the Bitstream version of Gill Sans
    \u2013 but then there are major differences between Bitstream's interpretation
    of say, Futura, and everyone elses' versions of the 'same' Futura.\r\n\r\nTim
    \u2013 I thought that alternate one version had disappeared completely! So Monotype
    still have it eh? But not Adobe/Linotype? Thanks for the links.\r\n\r\nJackie
    \u2013 it's fair to say that the entire industry was in a state of flux back then
    \u2013 and not everyone honoured their promises about 'who would distribute what'.
    I worked for one of Monotype's resellers in the early 90s and there were a great
    many anguished phone calls... \r\n(BTW, my avatar image is a handprint made by
    my daughter when she was aged about seven, the B is hand-drawn; I've never seen
    the Berkley Crime Books logo you refer to elsewhere.)"

    it is not OT, would you say that my version (ca. 1987) is identical to what Monotype
    are now selling for Type 1?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about the welcome change from
    the original (wasted away and anemic) digital Bembo to the new Bembo Book, but
    I don't remember seeing any references to Gill Sans being re-digitized. Am I right
    or am I left?"

    too (as bert_vanderveen pointed out) that it had a \u201Cflagged\u201D numeral
    One, but otherwise it was decent, but most likely different, as any BQ versions

    modern/sans serif faces, like Futura and Univers, and these seemed to be a bit
    more down-to-earth, a bit less polished, a little darker and robust than the respective
    versions of other foundries. I think it's quite a safe bet to say their version
    of Gill was like that, too, at least for a tendency.\r\n"
