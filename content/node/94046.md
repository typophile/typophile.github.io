  is the latest Koziupa and Paul adventure. This time, they max out on calligraphic
  art deco, then add a healthy dose of the thick-and-thin mantra that\u2019s been
  so trendy for quite a few years now. The result is neo-psychedelia in an upright
  cross-breed of pseudo-wood deco and ornamental calligraphy, complete with alternates,
  swashes, endings, playful contrast treatments, and even background possibilities.
  This font is quite expressive, and its elegance is meant to be shown prominently.
  So use it for packaging, book covers, or wherever the message needs to be delivered
  clearly and with a precisely controlled touch of class.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophileara_5820.jpg]\r\n\r\nLicense
