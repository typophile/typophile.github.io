body: "This looks very odd to me and I'd like an expert opinion on exactly what is
  wrong. I'm not great at recognising serif faces but I think the lower-case is a
  Caslon or perhaps a Garamond. However the upper-case seems to be a different face
  & possibly manually slanted rather than a true italic. The weight is a bit heavier.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ItalicsR_4438.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ItalicsC_3865.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Italics_5746.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ItalicsB_5125.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  more I look at it I wonder if the lower-case is a mixture or has been tweaked in
  some way too. The angle of the ascenders of l and d in \"Children's\" is a bit different."
