  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there, first-time poster here. I'm not a typographer, just a type enthusiast, but my question is to do with handwriting and I'd like very much to hear your thoughts on the following matter. <BR> <BR>I recently stumbled across an old website advocating the teaching of italic, joined-up handwriting in UK schools rather than separate letters. Here's a link to the site: <BR> <BR><a href="http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/quilljar/init.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/quilljar/init.html">http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/quilljar/init.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Here's the bit that interested me: <BR> <BR><blockquote>&quot;..In 1913 the LCC  (London County Council) School inspectors decided to encourage teachers of infants to use a  print script based upon the 10th Century Winchester Bible. An expert on lettering, Edward Johnston, had told the LCC that he recommended that approach for his Art School students. Unfortunately, it proved disastrous for small children, who have now been taught lettering from the age of five instead of joined-up writing. <BR> <BR>Plenty of research has shown that handwriting is the learning of a physical activity. Poor habits learnt early are very hard indeed to change. Learning the staccato stop - go - stop way of writing separate letters, however clear they may be, does not help with cursive (joined) writing later on.&quot;</blockquote> <BR> <BR>I certainly find writing in italics to require less force/energy/effort than writing separate letters. However, my italic handwriting isn't very pretty, and I've always thought writing separate letters to be neater, clearer and better-looking (although I realise this will vary greatly from individual to individual).  <BR> <BR>Do you agree that teaching italic, joined-up writing is a better approach than teaching young children to write separate letters for handwriting? Which do you prefer? And is there indeed any evidence to back one method over another?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Simply from the basis of ease and speed, joined italic writing beats other forms of handwriting: it is a very efficient script. So from a writing perspective, I favour it, even though I never learned it properly and have largely fallen back on something closer to Johnston's script, which is slower and more wearying. <BR> <BR>The Norwegian experiment to which Hrant directs our attention is interesting and seems to me a good thing on the whole, but its radicalness needs to be seen in the Norwegian context: 'Instruction in cursive handwriting is postponed until the age of eight, when it is taught in a fraction of the time normally spent on the subject.' How many North American school children develop any kind of decent handwriting before the age of eight anyway?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Handwriting in schools?&hellip; If you want to speak about legibility of handwriting, mine was certainly better when I was in first grade. <BR> <BR>However: &quot;Prof Trageton believes personality can be expressed as well through drawing as through handwriting.&quot; Analyze these writing samples then&hellip; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56692.jpg" alt="rk handwriting 2"> <BR> <BR> <BR>I would be interested in knowing how much of handwriting lessons sticks with people or even affects their development. How do different teaching styles at different ages effect your writing when you are 20 or 30? It seems like most of us were taught in similar way of how to properly draw regular and cursive letters, but everyone has such different looking writing when they get older. <BR> <BR>I am not sure how this relates, but driver's ed. keeps popping up in my</div>
