    behavior&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Huh? Abraham is 1700 BCE probably, Moses is 1300 BCE,
    and Jews don&#39;t have intimate contact with Zoroasterianism until about 500
    BCE., when they are exiled in Babylon. There I think they pick up the ideas of
    heaven and hell, the end of days, resurection. None of these are in the Torah,
    which is fully written down by 1000 BCE roughly, the time of King David. The focus
    on ethics was there way before the Babylonian exile, and the ethical ideas from
    Abraham and Moses continue in Rabbinic Judaism, then subsequently Christianity
    and Islam. <BR> <BR>If you know some other history give me the references.'

    prison, as he became a Muslim and went to  <BR>Africa&#41; he changed his take

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll shut up now... I&#39;m no Malcolm X historian, and nor do I
    have <BR>all these nuances of issues resolved in my own mind &#40;relating to

  body: '&#62;not related to ethics at all.  <BR> <BR>Actually these are mainly theological,
    and don&#39;t have to do really with the content of ethics. In the history of
    Judaism, Jews only adopted the idea of resurrection at the time of Chanukah, in
    165 BCE, because it was obvious that good and pious people were getting martyred
    rather than getting the earthly rewards promised in the Torah. So they bought
    the whole heaven-hell end of days &amp; resurrection package.  <BR> <BR>The influence
    of this is in my opinion decidedly mixed. On one hand it may have helped to push
    the idea that we should try to make a better world on earth - one variation on
    the messianic idea. On the other hand, the whole black and white way of thinking
    leads to fanaticism. It became Manichaeism, which influenced Christianity much
    more, with the idea of the Devil as an independent actor causing harm, and other
    ideas.  <BR> <BR>Abraham and especially Moses were already social reformers seeking
    a more just society, so I tend to think that the Zoroasterian influence &#40;if
    it is that, as historians don&#39;t agree&#41; is largely bad. <BR> <BR>Next post
    will be on topic!'

  body: 'It&#39;s very telling that this thread has evolved into discussions over
    religion. I&#39;ll bet John could have predicted it would happen. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
    my take: Who we choose to work for and who we&#39;d turn away is ultimately a
    personal decision. For every person &#40;or studio&#41;, it comes down to what
    they&#39;re comfortable with and whether they can look themselves in the mirror
    at the end of the day &#40;and whether looking at themselves in the mirror is
    even important to them at all&#41;. It seems the real danger lies when we try
    to enforce our personal standards &#40;whether based on opinion, religion, personal
    experience, morals or ethics&#41; upon others.  <BR> <BR>And then there&#39;s
    the <a href="http://www.emigre.com/ArticleFTF.php">First Things First manifesto</a>
    published in Emigre #51. As designers, we hold within our reach the power to shape
    the way people perceive the world around them, and it&#39;s my opinion that we
    ought to use our talents to try to make the world a better place. &#40;Yes, the
    definition of &#39;better place&#39; will vary from person to person.&#41; The
    FTF manifesto suggests a move away from promoting abject consumerism of inessential
    products in order to focus our efforts on cultural and social change. I can get
    behind this, but I also recognize that I need such clientele in order to make
    a living and feed my family. So I choose carefully who to take on so that at a
    minimum, we&#39;re not aiding an organization that is negatively impacting the
    world. <BR> <BR>As a founder and partner in a design firm, it was important to
    me to align with partners who shared a similar goal, so that we may avoid conflict
    over selecting design opportunities that present themselves.  Has anyone out there
    been faced with a decision in their studios in which the partners differed over
    taking on a specific client?  What was the outcome?  <BR> <BR>I recognize there
    are plenty of designers out there who have no qualms about taking on Corporation
    X or Y, and could care less whether they make the world a better place... Who
    see no need to distinguish between clientele. It&#39;s not my place to decide
    what&#39;s &#34;good&#34; and who&#39;s &#34;bad&#34; so I pledge that I won&#39;t
    disrespect you for your choices in the event we differ - all I ask is the same
    courtesy. There&#39;s plenty of work out there to keep us all busy, and as Tiffany
    said, at least this way we won&#39;t be competing. <BR> <BR>Finally, what&#39;s
    your thought on taking on Pro Bono or non-profit work?  Personally, I think it
    a good thing that design firms take on some work in order to help organizations
    that never could otherwise afford the expertise. It&#39;s also a great way to
    stay grounded and avoid having every design project be driven by the almighty
    dollar.'

    don&#39;t have the will nor the ability to consider macroeconomic issues - they&#39;re
    simply trying to eke out a living. They have the sense not to trust the powers
    that be to look after them. And they&#39;re not qualified to consider matters
    of state anyway &#40;they&#39;re qualified to repair shoes or serve food&#41;,
    and most of them have the sense to know that. It is mostly in the West that the
    illusion of individual relevance to society is so strikingly enforced. Why? Because
    a watertight system has been built, and when you give people the illusion of power
    they&#39;re a lot less likely to overturn it. Voting, freedom of speech, mandatory
    public education of children, television, the whole thing is rigged to produce
    and maintain servile, oblivious peons. <BR> <BR>What the oppressed masses of people
    want in this world is something very basic they don&#39;t have: being treated
    decently. Your system is making things worse for most people, not better. And
    the few that it makes things better for, it shields from a realization of its
    inhumanity, lest their sense of decency causes problems. <BR> <BR>Back off from
    destroying the world, otherwise you&#39;ll get your due in the end, one way or

    or geopolitical background.  <BR> <BR>Indeed. Discriminating against an <i>individual</i>
    is racism, which is unfair and damaging. But making observations about groups
    of people &#40;for example that Armenians are more conservative than the French&#41;,
    and even acting on them, is not racism. In fact, it&#39;s natural, and the only
    way forward. Otherwise you&#39;re stuck in a relativist world where nobody is
    responsible for their actions. <BR> <BR>Cultures create and maintain values, and
    these can be conducive to the health of humanity as a whole, or not. Fear of pointing
    out problems in certain cultures &#40;like the American gluttony&#41; is exactly
    what the system wants you to feel. And just in case you&#39;re a brave person,
    you&#39;ll never get your views aired in the mainstream anyway. And you can&#39;t
    even complain about that, because you have no Formal Proof &#40;a requirement
    for credibility in western culture&#41; of media bias &#40;and even if you did
    you could never publicize it&#41;, and because anyway you have freedom of speech,
    right?... Anybody can say anything they want, and they feel better, reducing the
    chances for <i>action</i>. Nevermind that you can only ever say it to a few hundred
    people at most. When you think about it, dissent is essentially undemocratic.

    best there ever was. Why? Because people believe what you tell them, and through
    the media the system conveys self-aggrandizement, to maintain stability. <BR>

    <i>through</i> individuals, right? Well yes, that&#39;s just life. The alternative
    is worse. <BR> <BR>No individual exists outside of his societies. Thinking <i>that</i>
    is an escape. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re strong enough, you will do something on the
    order of Rachel Corrie. I know I&#39;m not. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: a late post to this discussion, but trying to claw it back on track... <BR>
    <BR>first i totally agree with what jared posted above -- i share a a lot of what
    he had to say <BR> <BR>i remember when i was an undergraduate at <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography">reading</a>
    and we had a lecture from michael twyman. he asked us &#39;who wouldn&#39;t you
    work for?&#39;. out of the 25 students in the year, only about 5 of us had thought
    about this issue already and engaged in a discussion. the rest of the group just
    sat there -- their concern was getting a job and not what their personal ethics
    were. this has always stuck with me. <BR> <BR>at my first job &#40;<a href="http://www.textmatters.com">text
    matters</a>&#41; i found a place that had ethics rather than just looking for
    a quick buck. at one point, before i started working there, the staff decided
    that they didn&#39;t want to pitch for a project as they didn&#39;t believe that
    the organisation was just. pro-bono work was common place. <BR> <BR>now runing
    my own studio, i try &#40;with my partner&#41; to take on pro-bono work where
    possible. we have a &#39;charity&#39; day rate for those organisations that would
    benefit from our skills but cannot afford our normal rate. we do work for &#39;big
    business&#39; on occasions. but not for the likes of mcdonalds, gap, nike etc.
    we only do it where we can make a difference &#40;and it allows us to still eat
    and keep a roof over our heads while we help out charities and not-for-profit
    groups. <BR> <BR>just my 2p...
