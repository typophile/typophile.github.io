  body: "It also has a strong resemblance to Red Rooster's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/chamfer-gothic-rr/\"
    target=\"new\">Chamfer Gothic</a>. You have to look at it at very large sizes
    to see that it has the same corners. A little further stroke clipping and corner
    nicking , and you could easily duplicate 'Gimme Sum', I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
