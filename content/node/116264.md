  body: As far as I've been able to google, the street signage in Edinbrugh uses a
    custom lettering alphabet (or possibly typeface, these days) designed by David
    Kindersley. Kindersley's other, similar designs include [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/octavian/|Octavian]]
    and the lettering on Cambridge's Grand Arcade, now digitzed (and free) as [[http://www.kindersleyworkshop.co.uk/type-design/|Kindersley
    Street]]. The latter only has minor differences in style.
