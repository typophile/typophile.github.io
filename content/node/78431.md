  deleting them one by one.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    this Flickr page</a>. If you have legitimate global guidelines, you could extend
    the script to add those back.

  body: Version 6 isn't due out for a long time. I figure the announced date "late
    December 2010" was a case of number inversion. They meant 2100. I'll be over 150
    then. Should I wait?

  body: Charles, that was my way of chiding in a sarcastic manner :-) Everyone knows
    they are still working on it.  Frankly, I would rather they get it right, right
    off, than get it off, right now.  I am tired of spraying RAID on my computer.

    for 10 years or more. Bug-wise, after that experience, FontLab is a joy.
