body: "Hi, I have a little mystery I would like to solve. \r\n\r\nFor a job I am doing,
  I am trying out a typeface called Wembley, which I have on my computer at my I part
  time job. When I went looking for the typeface online, to see where I could get
  it, I came up totally blank. I could not find any reference to it anywhere. Which
  is a bit odd, since there clearly exists a digitized version. \r\n\r\nI tried to
  track back where and when they got it, but I couldn't find it out. They only had
  the light and light italic version, in post script. \r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot
  of how it looks, does anyone know more about this typeface?\r\n\r\n/ Kalle[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wembley_6522.gif]"

  body: "Well, no it's \u201Cactually called\u201D Richmond Oldstyle, and is a typeface
    from almost a century ago. Nick Curtis did a revival of it, which he called Rowan
    Oak, but his version has much better spacing than what Kalle shows above.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    somebody else did a poorer digitization of the same original typeface? In any
    case, Nick's version is a good place to go.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: It seems that Wembley Light was done by Treacyfaces (http://typophile.com/node/37751)
    and that Greater Albion gave its interpretation too (http://typophile.com/node/55638).

  body: My guess is that this is the Wembley from International Typefounders. The
    ITF Book 1 came a CD-ROM with all the fonts on it, but locked. After installing
    and registering by fax,you would 'get' 25 'free' fonts, including the Wembley
    Light and Light Oblique.
