  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Most business relationships are built upon trust. Unfortunately, when you are an artist, whether it be, designer, painter, photographer, etc. you have to learn to withhold your own trust.</p>
<p>In business school, business people are taught to buy their goods at the cheapest possible price, and barter for the lowest possible cost. This is the nature of their business. You can&rsquo;t hold it against them. That&rsquo;s just the way they are.</p>
<p>What changes things in your perspective, as an artist , is that you are dealing with people that are lying to you straight faced and point blank about the value of your work, in order to save a few bucks. That&rsquo;s very disturbing when you realize this reality. Very disturbing, yet true. Most artists are very good, fair, honest people. Most business people are not.</p>
<p>Never sell yourself short. And NEVER take their opinion seriously. Look at them, straight faced and seriously, and lie to them right back. Tell them how much you understand that they are right, and then proceed to do what you would have done anyway without their intervention.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it REALLY doesn&rsquo;t matter what they think because they are morons. Do the rest of us artists a service and ask for more money. You&rsquo;re worth it. Trust me.</p>
