  a modern looking sans serif font would work well rather than the serif type that
  is usually used on dictionaries for the main text.\r\n\r\nI wonder if any on here
  knew of any good types.\r\n\r\nI am basically trying to combine (stylish/modern/cool/classy/sleek/sophisticated/)
  with the idea of the dictionary.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help!\r\n\r\nthis was one
  example I thought of: http://www.hypefortype.com/nuorder.html \r\n\r\nor maybe not,
  you might have better types"

      i'm looking at.\r\n\r\nI am selecting certain words out that describe/sum up
      the values of a certain brand.\r\n\r\nI will only be changing the example of
      the words in context basically writing funny examples for each of the words
      I have selected.\r\n\r\nSo it's a combination of academic and comedy. I'm using
      words from the Oxford dictionary that won't change (not stupid words like Urban
      dictionary) but maybe the funny element (although not crude) like urban dictionary
      for the examples.\r\n\r\nIt would be print (mini booklet), with the idea to
      expand possible it to online/digital\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brand itself is a bit of
      a rebellious brand (covers a wide range of areas in the market); known to do
      things slightly different, but at the same time, it's modern, classy, innovative,
      and caring I think."

    to look like dictionary text so people get the visual reference. You might be
    able to use slightly more contemporary, hip, trendy &c fonts, but stray to far
    from the norm, and people will probably think \u201Cwhat\u2019s up with this weird
    type that looks something like a dictionary?\u201D You are already making it clever,
    different &c by changing the language.\r\n\r\nThat aside, what exactly does this

    company that covers entertainment to travel business areas. I could mention the
    name but i'm not going to haha! \r\n\r\nI'm not copying the Oxford dictionary
    directly, just looking at their definitions of words as they are surely the best
    to look for the correct definition for words.\r\nMaybe i'll just get the rough
    jist of the definition by combining other dictionary/online definitions of the
    same word and type that out, if having a direct copy of Oxfords would be an issue;
    \ good point though - i'll be careful with the copyright issue.\r\n\r\n\"It just
    needs to look like dictionary text so people get the visual reference\" \r\n\r\nI
    agree. I went with a serif at first but wondered if it looked too boring and old;
    maybe there are modern serifs as well as Sans Serifs that get the dictionary reference
    across well.\r\n\r\nI was looking at Didot as the main font at first, but my typography
    knowledge isn't very strong, that's why I wondered if you could suggest suitable
    types that I would then choose from.\r\n\r\n\"You are already making it clever,
    different &c by changing the language.\" \r\n\r\nyep, good point. I didn't want
    it to be let down by a rubbish type i'd choose, because of my rubbish typography
    knowledge. I'll play around with layout - probably won't have it exactly like
    a dictionary layout as that would be boring.\r\n\r\nI might be able to have more
