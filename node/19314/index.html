  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings: I'm looking for type suggestions for a variety of projects. I perform desktop publishing for local Virginia businesses, Clients including a realtor, developer, builder, photographer, equine non-profit, and others. I write/design ads and promos that appear in local papers and weekly publications (newsprint); as well as newsletters; flyers; brochures; and business cards/letterhead.
Back in the dinosaur days when we purchased type on floppy disks, I had TONS of Adobe stuff, but found I generally used three or four faces regularly.  Now, after a long hiatus from this type of work, my floppy versions are gone, and I'd like to purchase some new type.
As much as I try to "expand" my tastes, I usually choose type with the same characteristics: large x-height and tight letter spacing. Also, I often like condensed versions in headers. Lately, my type of choice has been ITC Century Std, in the past it has been Garamond. I like Utopia, but have never tried it. "Regulars" include Bookman and Palatino, and for sans serif, Helvetica (although I never like the way it looks; I got used to it when I worked for a corp. that used it as their official typeface). As you can see, my choices are all pretty mainstream. 
These days, I'm looking to find about half a dozen typefaces that work together in a variety of print materials.  I'd like to try something new, fresh, more modern, that will work with/compliment the style I like (and will continue to use, no doubt) and I'd hope to find a sans serif, as well as something more casual. Please, any creative suggestions for a collection of type would be greatly appreciated!  I'm hoping you'll all get me to think outside the box a bit...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Claire: What a surprise... Greetings to you my friend. Not sure after so many years that I am capable of accurately predicting your present tastes. Perhaps you could send along some further clues of likes and dislikes so that I may make a better suggestion.... As you know I'm an architect, so I prefer, and continue to use, a more relaxed typeface that allows for a little flexibility in interpretation. Feel free to contact me directly at architeradesign@yahoo.com if you wish. Hans</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Claire,

I am a graphic design student in Leesburg Va, about to graduate this fall. I can tell you that some of the favorites around campus among designers are: Helvetica Neue LT Std —lots of typeface choices and glyphs, Century Gothic, Avenir, a new favorite of mine currently is Hypatia Sans Pro.

Just today, I ordered a copy of Vetren from http://www.fonteaminternational.com/fonthome.html. I needed a casual looking sans serif.

For what it is worth, I often reach back in time and pull out Bodoni, Goudy Old Style, and Weiss for contrast.

Hope this is helpful. Let me know if you come across a sans serif that you are particulary attracted to. I recently worked on an annual report for a marine related hardware corporation and set body copy in  Apollo MT. It worked out great—at least I was pleased with the result. Good luck.

If you have the budget, the FontStars pack would be a great way to get 'modernized'.</div>
