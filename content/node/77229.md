  and I have recently finished creating my first completed font. It's a TrueType font.
  It's a highly original and stylish display type of font. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I was thinking
  I was gonna try to make some money with it, and was wondering if anyone out there
  could offer some guidance and advice. Anything I should know about finding and dealing
  with a distributor? Do I need to make them sign something to keep from getting ripped
  off if they prove to be scandalous? (I'm always suspicious I guess)  \r\n\r\nI'd
  rather not have to market it myself even if I had my own website, setting up a shopping
  cart system etc..\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    rate and you will probably sell more fonts just at MyFonts than through multiple
    other distributors who pay lower rates. After your font sales start to slow down
    at MyFonts it might be worthwhile to start selling through other vendors as well.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t
    bother with exclusive deals unless you either cannot finish the font production
    yourself or your work is so good that you can actually get someone to agree in
    writing to either promote your work or to give you a hefty advance on royalties.
    Otherwise they\u2019ve got no incentive to promote your work other than just sticking
    it into a forgettable email blast."

  body: I've had good luck with myfonts.com. I only have one font distributed through
    them (the only one I've finished), and I've been very happy with how well the
    font has done, and how easy they are to work with. The downside is that after
    a week or so, your font is off their new font pages, and sales will drop off,
    so you might want to figure out some additional ways to promote your font on your
    own.

  body: "Sorry for not responding back sooner.\r\n\r\nDunwich - Thanks for your advice
    again! You've helped me out a lot on other posts too! You're awesome. Your advice
    here is the opposite from a lot of advice I've heard on this topic. I've heard
    that myfonts has so many fonts that your font can get lost in the sea of fonts
    they have, like a needle in a haystack. I was planning on going to myfonts as
    a last resort. I would really like to get a foundry to sell my font for me and
    market it for me and everything, (exclusive deal and they would probably tell
    me to make changes or make changes themselves if they decided it was worth it)
    but that's a great idea to get in writing from a foundry that they will promote
    it (that's exactly what I need them to do) or give me a hefty advance (any idea
    what that might be?) or otherwise they won't really care if it sells well will
    they? That makes a lot of sense to me and no one has said that to me before!\r\n\r\nSo,
    if that doesn't work out and it probably won't (I wouldn't bet on it anyway though
    I will try to make a deal like this happen) I will just go through myfonts, and
    what I will try to do is somehow generate interest in the font myself and point
    as many people towards it as possible myself, through my own website, and other
    websites, or whatever.\r\n\r\nkentlew - I read the article. Thanks!\r\n\r\njonathan
    - That's what I've heard. I'm worried about very low traffic coming my way if
    I go through myfonts. But you say you do get traffic huh? Or have you found it
    necessary to do a lot of promotional work to point people to your myfonts page?\r\n\r\nI'm
    not planning on quitting my dayjob, but I would like to get as much quality traffic
    as possible, because if a thousand people see the font, way more people will want
    it and use it then if only 12 random people a year see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you have the option of promoting your font yourself. You can set up a simple online
    store using Google Checkout or BigCartel & Pulley for under $100. Then you can
    buy web ads on sites like Typophile, UnderConsideration, and the various design
    magazine blogs at fairly low rates. If you have a few thousand dollars to spend
    you can even run a print campaign in magazines like Eye and Baseline. Just check
    out the local regulations on internet sales and sales tax first. I don't have
    an online store because I refuse to contribute to New York's idiotic approach
    to internet sales tax collection."

    even if it costs me money, and those are some great suggestions on ways to do

    you're satisfied that you're as protected as you can possibly be, but you must
    promise to make a big deal out of it when you do make your design public.

  body: "Oh - everyone - it's opentype now. I originally posted this like 4 months
    ago. I've really only been concentrating on creating fonts for 4 months now, but
    I've been designing unfinished ones for many years. I'm a graphic designer and
    I've studied typography for over ten years. Only recently have I felt that I was
    good enough to pursue font-design more, and I do now hope to make a side-business
    out of it. \r\n\r\nApetickler - it's funny you say that. Just today I was thinking
    how I'd be afraid to release my fonts onto this site for criticism. Some of the
    people here would tear into them like jackals, and I just don't need that negativity
    in my life right now. When I release them, I hope that no one on this site even
    connects them to me. Not because they aren't good, but just because I feel some
    people on this site would bash them anyway and put them under a microscope and
    criticize everything that they could possible think of about them, and most of
    the criticism would be a bunch of opinionated bs anyway."

    solid feedback. In the dozens of other critique threads I've read, I can't recall
    any negative criticism that not intended to be helpful. Hopefully you're getting
    at least some critique from someone who has been designing fonts. Like anything,
    without an outside perspective, you're likely to overlook something.\r\n\r\n\"When
    I release them, I hope that no one on this site even connects them to me.\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    kind of shooting yourself in the foot. If designing type is something you want
    to pursue, having the people on this site be able to know what you've would be
    a good thing.\r\n\r\n"

    to me, who seem to love to argue and need to go join a debate team somewhere because
    they miss their old high school debate team. It's ironic that you are so fast
    to argue and disagree with me and say that I'm wrong when you want to be the first
    see my new font. Somehow I feel that you would not go easy on my font. I mean
    I'm literally laughing right now. You really crack me up.

    seem to be really defensive. I'm not sure if the \"you\" is me, or if you're speaking
    generically, but I know that I never said I wanted to be the first to see your
    new font. I've reread my posts in this thread and I don't see anything that could
    be perceived as anything other than a helpful suggestion.\r\n\r\nLike any community,
    there are people on this site who at least come off as less than pleasant. If
    you don't like some specific people, then why do you care what they say? Also,
    just because someone is a d-bag doesn't mean they don't occasionally offer some
    useful critique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If I were to decide that I respect your opinion

    in a private correspondence. So far I've looked at your stuff and to tell you
    the truth, I'm not really that impressed\"\r\n\r\nAgain - wow. Where did I ever
    say that I thought you should put your font on this site so that I could critique
    it? I'm barely beyond the novice stage, which is precisely why I have posted various
    designs in the critique section, and also why I rarely post any critiques of anyone
    else's work. But thanks for the encouraging words.\r\n\r\nI was merely trying
    to encourage you to get your work out in the community to get some feedback. Like
    I said in my previous post, I've gotten lots of useful criticism about my stuff
    (you know -- the stuff you're not really impressed with), and no one in the Critique
    section has been anything other than polite and helpful. So do what you want.
    I don't think anyone really cares of you post it here or not, or remain anonymous.
    But as far as I know, there are no other online communities like typophile that
    give you access to some of the top people in the field, nor are there any communities
    filled with as many people who are ready and willing to actually PAY for fonts.
    So again, I think anyone who is a type designer who willingly cuts himself off
    from this community is shooting himself in the foot.\r\n\r\n"
