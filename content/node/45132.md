  Elephant / Big Figgins. I am looking for a stylized Bodoni much like it, but with
  nice kerning pairs, and a little bit 'updated'.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello there:\r\n\r\nI own Big Figgins and it has many kerning pairs. As I
    have used it more and more I have come to notice there is not a single curve out
    of place\u2014I happen to think it\u2019s perfectly harmonious. \r\n\r\nThere
    are not too many Bodoni/Figgins interpretations that are as good. The only one
    I can think of is not released just yet:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.christianschwartz.com/brunel.shtml\r\n\r\nAlso
    here is a script I use to test the kerning in the fonts I own\u2014here; set in
    Big Figgins Roman:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figgins_4994.png]\r\n\r\nMikey

    in my possession is Elephant and Elephant Italic. Elephant Italic has some really
    awkward moments. Do you know where I can purchase Big Figgins? I can't seem to
    find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCarl"
