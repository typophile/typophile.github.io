  body: "Stephen -- Thanks for your help. Looks like it is probably <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/target/\">Target</a>
    by Tomi Haaparanta.\r\n\r\nThe logo is in the HOW International Design Annual.
    It is nice to see someone thinking a little differently about political campaign
    graphics. \r\n\r\nWhat I like is the feel of the type face. I am working on a
    logo that needs to be a little casual but remains professional enough to be taken
    seriously. My client is here in Austin and embodies the cities laid-back and professional
    character.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: I love the logo but can't say I think the font goes very well with it. Also
    I'd close up the space btw the name and "FOR CONGRESS".

    have done tighter word spaces (but wide wordspaces appear to be an American affliction)."

    more well-drawn, consider <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/376692625/">Bryant</a>.

  body: Stephen, I as actually thinking <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/conduit/">ITC
    Conduit</a>. which retains a condensed feel and that soft feel.

  body: True. Conduit is also charmingly irregular. That may or may not tickle Duncan's
    fancy.
