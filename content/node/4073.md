  <BR> <BR><i>The Untitled Project is a series of photographs of urban settings accompanied
  by a graphical text layout. The photographs have been digitally stripped of all
  traces of textual information. The text pieces show the removed text in the approximate
  location and font as it was found in the photograph.</i>'

  body: It&#39;s odd how the pictures are so &#39;quiet&#39; without the words and
    brands of every day life. It&#39;s sort of like sitting in an office all day and
    being there when the AC finally shuts off...you didn&#39;t realise how loud it
    was until it was gone.

  body: Oh right. That is what it is. Less noise. Almost creating a sense of tranquility
    or maybe even less worldly.

  body: 'I read an essay by Hermann Zapf in which he decries the clutter of badly
    designed signs with over large letters that befoul the landscape. He calls it
    &#39;visual pollution&#39;. Our American strip-malls are particular offenders. '

  body: 'Thank you, thank you, that&#39;s one of the most enlightening displays I&#39;ve
    seen. Typography is only part of the problem. It&#39;s the total accumulation
    of mindless and trendy material. In an essay in the Japanese design magazine,
    Idea for September 1973, I wrote that these bring visual discomfort to our everyday
    lives and one endures them like the noise and foul air. If I may quote myself:  &#34;One
    has only to try and fill a shopping list in a supermarket or attempt to get from
    one part of a major city to another to experience the chaos that is contemporary
    packaging, promotional material, and signing.&#34; For what it&#39;s worth. I
    think the situation has gotten even worse in this digital age. '
