    One simply must learn to back things up better. I also have a frayed copy of an
    American Type catalog from the 1930's I quite like and the collected works of
    Alf Becker from <em>Signs of The Times</em> magazine, of course.\r\n"

    <strong>No. 1</strong>: the loose-leaf type specimen of the Dutch Type Library.
    It contains more than 400 digitally (high-res) printed pages in black and red
    on <em>Mellotex mat</em> or <em>Promail</em> 115 grams A4 paper in a handmade
    linen binder. A matching \u2013handmade, of course\u2013 linen slipcase is available
    also. Production costs of specimen and slipcase are quite a bit higher than the
    retail prices, by the way.\r\n\r\nProduced in small quantities over the past 15
    years; normally sold-out almost immediately. Therefore 51&frac12; weeks <strong>not</strong>
    available per year.\r\n\r\nFEB"

  body: "Thanks very much for posting the link to the Rosart specimen pages, Frank.
    The more time I spend with Rosart's types, the more impressed I am.\r\n\r\nSome
    of my favourite type specimens:\r\n\r\n<em>Proeven van Oostersche Schriften.</em>
    Lettergieterij 'Amsterdam', Voorheen N. Tetterode. (Numerous editions; mine is
    1915. Particularly valued for its Javanese and Buginese types.)\r\n\r\n<em>Le
    Cabinet des Poin\xE7ons.</em> Imprimerie nationale, Paris. (Mine is the 3rd edition,
    1963.)\r\n\r\n<em>Specimens of Oriental Founts.</em> Cambridge University Press.
    (nd. but 1933.)\r\n\r\nThe Berthold specimen of Hebrew types from 1924 is worth
    mentioning, although I don't like many of the types very much. It is a handsomely
    produced volume, showing off some extravagant colour printing and ornament use.
    It is also a sad thing to handle, as an artifact of German Jewry at the moment
    when the Nazi party was beginning its rise to power. The specimen was produced
    under the guidance of <a href=\"http://yaronimus.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lubell.pdf\">Joseph
    Tscherkassky</a>, who was saved from the Holocaust by being sent to be Berthold's
    rep in Brazil in 1930.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Sauna specimen booklet, which one can actually take into the sauna/bath/steam
    room, is rather fun.\r\n\r\nThe book printed in blood, also from Underware, IIRC.\r\n\r\nPDFs
    are OK, but nowadays it is the interactivity of web sites and type testers that
    is increasingly important in allowing one to get to know a typeface.\r\n\r\nBut
    nothing can compare, for me, with turning the page of a real specimen."

    body: "Indeed, the specimens by Underware, including the one for Fakir are really
      well designed, produced, same as their fonts of course! I'm also quite fond
      of the specimens by House, which are vibrant books of typo-energy. \r\n\r\nBut
      it depends of course, I mean, the specimens mentioned above are large, illustrated
      overviews, while the classical specimens, with waterfalls of wood-and-leadprint,
      are a journey of discovery which often show that even the most far-out ideas
      in type design have been done before."

    printing operations using a huge range of metal type and included suggestions
    to printers for use. Printers were guided to styles that expressed the fashion
    of the day. Fascinating to see this change over the years. Digital versions at
    archive.org from University of Califorina and University of Toronto are good,
    ones from other sources are much less satisfying.\r\nDon"

  body: "Unfortunately, the only Enschede type specimens I could find online were
    really old ones.\r\nBut that search - or maybe it was a search related to the
    typeface Forma, instead - led me to learn about Deberny & Peignot's Serie 16 -
    and the [[http://www.cataloged.cc/?pid=82|revival]] of it currently being attempted.\r\n\r\nWhile
    the italic has definite idiosyncrasies, the Roman (at least its lower case) is
    very reminiscent of Century Schoolbook; thus, like some of the Scotch Romans by
    Fleischmann that I saw in those old Enschede type specimens, it approaches the
    canonical invisible typeface that I've been looking for (my interest in Textype
    was from this  quest as well)."
