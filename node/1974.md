body: I made some logos for a contest &#40;and I do think that there&#39;s some other
  thread here similar to this one, only by a different author and about a different
  sketch&#41; and I&#39;d really like to hear what you think about it, since it&#39;s
  pretty hard to get constructive criticism these days... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19984.gif"

  body: '&#34;information on the speed of birds&#34;...That&#39;s interesting. I would&#39;ve
    never guessed by this or the other thread, what the meaning of the logo was. I
    was wondering what the bird was representing. Still, I think the concept could
    be stronger, relative to the message. A strong indication of motion &#40;not a
    pasted arrow/bird&#41; throughout the logo would probably strengthen the concept.
    Your concept is moving &#40;no punn intended&#41; in a nice visual aesthetic direction,
    but the visual message could still use some exploration. <BR> <BR>Just think movement/speed/motion
    while your sketching. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: That helps, but I just don&#39;t know if the type is the right choice. I don&#39;t
    know all the details of the project, so I can&#39;t really say much more. It doesn&#39;t
    sound like you have much time to do more type research either...sooo, good luck!

  body: I agree with Scott. <BR>The bird has alot of curves whereas the typeface is
    just rectangles. Maybe a new typeface, or a more geometric bird? How could you
    integrate the bird into the type?
