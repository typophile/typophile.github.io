    wrote: \"It is obvious that no one dare to draw this on paint isn't it :D\"\r\n\r\nSo
    it seems to me what should be obvious is that you knew what it was when you posted
    it, therefore you are amusing yourself by trolling this forum. So don't go away
    mad that you've been outed; just go away."

  body: "George, I don't think he is trolling.\r\nHe believes this is a font because
    of the symbols' repetition.\r\n\r\nSemih, may be it's not created in paint, but
    there are a lot of options in illustration packages (e.g. Adobe Illustrator) to
    create the sample you presented by creating and repeating symbols or just by copy/paste
    a vector group or a bitmap.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it may look as a font but this doesn't
    necessarily mean <em>it actually is</em> a font.\r\nDo you know that these symbols
    represent an existing language?\r\nHave you encountered any other fonts containing
    similar abstract symbols?"

  body: I dont get what you mean what you're talking about but so far Fivos is the
    only person who tried to help me anyway. I've found what means this "font" yes
    it is a modernized runic font and there writes a turkish sentence. Yes, now I'm
    goin' away but I really got frustrated 'bout my "trolling" misunderstanding. You
    George, thank you, too, to get me wrong. And most thanks to Fivos. I'm leaving
    out this site and never come back. Indeed, so far, I'm member of so many forums.
    About everything and except this one, I become admin at so many times in some
    sites. But this site is never seen that I really really got annoyed. You could
    give up complaining by saying only "it's wrong topic here please delete this and
    put it on right". Don't you think so? Nooo, you don't think so. Because you think
    "being impolite" is the only way to piss somebody off. Your "inconsiderate" guys,
    made me this curse. I've never seen that before.  Anyway. Thank you Fivos, again.
    And thank you so much again for being the only person helpful. Have a "good" time.
    (hopefully)
