  design and multimedia. She lives in a smallish city (Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada),
  and works days, so she and her dad are thinking that would be the best option for
  her.\r\n\r\nThey're looking at Sessions (http://www.sessions.edu/) which is an accredited
  online-only institution, and looks okay. Any other options they should seriously
  consider? Any good/bad opinions on Sessions?\r\n\r\nNote that Sessions has a \"tuition
  sale\" for which tomorrow is the last day, so they're trying to make a decision
  quickly....\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nT"

    . . I love to online program,  they take very good care of their students and
    its an esay yet challenging curriculum. \r\n\r\nIf cost is an issue however this
    school may be a bit on the pricey side.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n"

    it's about 15x the size of the 'city' in which I live...!)"

    that one until today. But then again, there's always another small town....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Manitoba's kind of funny that way. We have Winnipeg (700 000), Brandon (50
    000) and then the list drops off... (there's only just over a million in the entire
    province). Winkler's about 8500 which qualifies it for city status in Manitoba,
    but I still don't think it's a city.\r\n\r\nIf she weren't working days, I'm sure
    there'd be a halfway decent visual arts/graphic design program somewhere in either
    the college or university in Regina."
