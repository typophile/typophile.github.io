  is from Klemperer's Messiah recording SAN 146-48.\r\ni had thought it would be an
  easy guess for whatthefont - alas i was wrong!\r\n\r\nthe font itself is neat though
  it looks rather odd on the cover (not to the least because the SANs, white background
  with the artwork in the bull-eye, usually show a single [Bodoni] font only)\r\nhttp://www.classicalvinyl.com/san-146-48-messiah-handel.html\r\n\r\nalso
  bare with me if u think the classification is wrong\r\n\r\n\r\nlooking 4ward to
  YOUR input\r\n\r\nkind regards\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/333_5913.JPG]"

  body: "I can comment on classification. This style is usually called uncial, but
    the lettering is unusual in that it has with a Roman capital _A_ instead of a
    lower case or unicase _a_.\r\nI don't recall a digital match.\r\nBTW the bottom
    terminal on _S_ is very similar to the one used in Arrus BT https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/arrus/
    which is based on lettering by Richard Lipton, who produced various hand-lettered
    calligraphic alphabets.\r\nUPDATE:\r\nOther possible classifications; Irish, Celtic,
    \ Book of Kells, Medieval, calligraphic.\r\nPossible source: English photolettering
    supplier?\r\nDon"

  body: "thanks so far\u2026\r\n\r\njust a few thoughts: the cover is from the mid-sixties.
    (rec. '64)\r\nthe high-time of (revival) uncials had long passed by then and i
    bet against a unique hand-lettering in an era when this stile was at best thought
    of as \"highly eccentric\".\r\nmoreover - i got the distinct feeling that there
    has to be a full set of letters etc. out there because the whole impression is
    not as monolithic as it would had the design  been created for \"MESSIAH\" alone.\r\nthe
    bottom terminal on the 's' to me looks very art-nouveau. and so does its top companion!\r\nregarding
    the 'a': the erbar mediaeval has a similar alternate cap 'a' - its legs however
    do not meet in a top-junction. still i think a dutch or english origin likelier."

  body: "Thanks for discography clarification.\r\nSo English photolettering is most
    probable.\r\nA lost of their work for corporate clients was custom and not in
    catalogs.\r\nAs for possible leads, one approach would be to find out who designed
    LP covers for EMI/Angel in the mid 1960s and  -- if they are still alive -- ask
    them about the source of the lettering.\r\nBTW have you seen any more letters
    like this on EMI/Angel LP covers?\r\nDon"

  body: "the angel records edition uses a different stile.\r\nhowever on the front
    of the enclosed booklet the above font is being used. a.r. just reprinted the
    hmv booklet with an added a.r. logo.\r\n\r\ni am not an expert by far but i haven't
    seen this specific font on any other hmv or angel cover.\r\nthere are some fonts
    -usual suspects aside - that at times seem to have been popular at design headquarters:
    e.g. weiss initials (et alternates), basilea etc. etc.\r\n\r\ni finally decided
    to tweak the pic from top a little and use it for my purpose anyways.\r\nstill
    interested in the origin of the font though and also if there is a digitized version.\r\n\r\ncheers!"
