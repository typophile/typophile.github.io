body: "My girlfriend, being totally awesome, is having a \"Font Party\" in Montreal
  this weekend, where guests are encourage to come \r\n\r\n<cite>dressed as the typeface
  that embodies your true inner self. creativity is encouraged; however, please be
  advised that if your true inner self is obnoxiously inappropriate in almost any
  situation (comic sans) or prone to injudiciously sporting designer knockoffs (arial)
  you may be politely turned away at the door.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'll probably come up
  with my own costume (though it's a little harder than I first thought), but I thought
  I'd share in case anyone found it amusing.\r\n\r\n(Maybe I'll take photos and post
  them to the Type ID board?)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Taking Comic Sans and Arial "off the table" limits guests creativity - I would
    skip this pretend party and go to the real party - TypeCon - instead.

    At least I hope, because I am considering dressing up as Comic Sans to annoy her."

    anyone is interested in the popular taste and dissemination of type knowledge
    of hip college kids these days (such as it is):\r\n\r\n* Akzidenz Grotesk \r\n*
    Book Antiqua\r\n* Courier\r\n* Georgia\r\n* Helvetica\r\n* Futura\r\n* MICR/compu-retro
