body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone can please recommend a close alternative
  to Helvetica Neue on [[http://www.google.com/webfonts|Google Web Fonts]] please?
  \ Open Sans seems close, but we're needing a fairly light (300) weight font, and
  we're wondering if there are any other alternatives you can recommend please?\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\nVWD."

  body: "Of course, there are open-source typefaces that closely resemble <em>old</em>
    Helvetica. Something so close that it's closer to Helvetica Neue than it is to
    Helvetica is perhaps not reasonable to hope for.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, other than
    an imitation of Helvetica, or Arial - which is basically Monotype Grotesque altered
    to have the same metrics as Helvetica - or Akzidenz Grotesk (also known as Standard),
    or Mercator... I've just come across another typeface which, although not an imitation
    of Helvetica, would stand as a legitimate alternative to it.\r\n\r\nI came across
    it when searching for more information about Egizio, as it is by the same designer
    - Forma."
