  body: "OMG, you're right...and I think we might all agree that it is MIS-used, right?
    People mistake it for retro (including me) because it looks so bad in a charming
    wood-type sort of way, but my guess is that it was never intended to stand alone.\r\n\r\nBeing
    an all-caps font, they must be inserting a Clarendon bold or Century Schoolbook
    for those cute underscored lowercase articles, pronouns, prepositions, etc.\r\n"
