  body: While the latter is definitly not <a href="http://www.thirstype.com/font_apexsans.html">apex
    sans</a>, it is similar, and I like apex better, honestly.

  body: Apex <i>is</i> lovely - at any weight under bold, which suffers from majorly
    clogged counters. <BR> <BR>That Atlantis logo first made me think of <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/type/alt/"
    target="_blank">Alias</a>&#39; stuff. But, alas, it is none of those.

  body: 'Funny: I had <i>exactly</i> the same idea, Stewf, but a run through their
    catalogue revealed nothing indeed. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen the Atlantis
    font before though, and I think it&#39;ll pop up in a quite unexpected place,
    something like <a href="http://www.t26.com/changeyourface.php" target="_blank">
    [t-26]</a> or Rian Hughes&#39; <a href="http://www.devicefonts.co.uk/" target="_blank">
    Device Fonts</a>. Just a hunch...'

  body: Well, it&#39;s been dramatically squished horizontally which makes it quite
    difficult to ID. &#40;Any excuse to  disguise the fact I haven&#39;t got a clue...
