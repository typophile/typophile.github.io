body: "I want to make a typeface that mimics hand lettering (for a graphic novel.
  The font needs to harmonize with the drawings.) I don't want the fact it is a typeface
  to be a dead give away at first glace, so I want to be able to insert slightly varied
  alternates to the most common characters.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to use up
  characters in the char set I'd never use otherwise, but this would be counter to
  the reason for using a typeface in the first place not to mention how it would screw
  up any attempts at spell checking. So, nix to that idea.\r\n\r\nThe next idea is
  to make three fonts with interchangeable characters (all the same weight - slightly
  different but in the same hand) and treat them as bold normal and italic. This just
  doesn't seem all that elegant.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way?\r\nThanks"

  body: "I just had a font created from my handwriting, which was complicated because
    it's a semi-script which meant we needed a variety of alternate characters and
    ligatures. Open type gives you lots of glyphs, beyond the standard character set.
    I wouldn't create three separate fonts, I'd just hire an editor to proofread your
    copy and not worry too much about spellcheck. The beauty of it being a font instead
    of handlettering is that you can easily correct the spelling errors.\r\n\r\nIf
    you use InDesign you can mess around like crazy with the alternate characters.
    It's fun!"
