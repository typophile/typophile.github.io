    target="_blank">Trajan Bold</a> actually, and not stretched but letterspaced.
    Dunno about the 250 though.

  body: The figures are from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/small-caps-and-old-style-figures/testdrive.html?s=250&amp;p=72">
    Palatino</a>.

  body: I actually think the figures are derived from the very similar Zapf face <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/aldus/roman-small-caps-and-oldstyle-figures/testdrive.html?s=250&amp;p=72">Aldus</a>.
    At the junction between the straight and curved parts of the &#34;5&#34;, the
    curve starts upward before it goes downward in the Palatino figures, but in the
    sample and Aldus, the curve just goes downward.

  body: Many thanks, all! <BR> <BR>Obviously a newbie ? - how could one purchase,
    say, Aldus Roman, and still have access to the Aldus OS figures?

  body: Some fonts come with OS figures built into the normal uppercase/lowercase
    set, but most of the ones from the giants like Adobe and Linotype have a separate
    small caps/OSF font for each weight that you have to buy for an extra $20. If
    want to recreate the logo, all you need is the small caps/OSF font &#40;$20&#41;,
    but if you want the full set of roman, italic, and SC/OSF, you&#39;ll have to
    shell out ~$57 on MyFonts &#40;there&#39;s also an Italic Oldstyle Figures, for
    an additional $20, but if you&#39;re trying to save money I wouldn&#39;t buy that
    unless you find yourself with a specific need for the figures in italics&#41;
