body: "I am currently in a bit of a pickle. I like drop caps at the head of a book
  chapter... more specifically, I enjoy the pairing of drop caps and small caps for
  the first word (or three) of the chapter. \r\n\r\nMy problem comes when the height
  of the drop caps. right now, I am using a two-line height with small caps for the
  first word. \r\n\r\nMy question to those of you who've worked with books is: how
  do you choose to lay out the first page of a chapter?\r\n\r\nI've attached the current
  design of the first page of chapter i. It looks so... boring. I'm a fan of the crystal
  goblet school of thought, but it just seems to be missing something. Please be as
  highly critical as you please. I'd like it to look as good as possible, obviously. "

  body: The problem to my eye is the small capitals, which are so much taller than
    lower case, so, with anfang (or dropped capital), the result is too busy. Try
    with more words in small caps, or try without small caps, and see if that helps.

  body: "Zach, I dared myself to play a little with your text setting - hope you take
    it as a typophile's friendly cooperation and not as a sign of arrogance. In general
    terms, I am not a fan of the drop cap technique, but if you want to create an
    \"old style\" feeling it can work. But there are some things to manage: in the
    first image, I've aligned the drop cap to the left margin with the paragraph nested
    style, increased the kerning in the space between D and ae, and increased the
    tracking in the small caps of \"aerwyn\" (I think it needed it). The second example
    is similar but doesn't feature the drop cap, just small caps (with capital C)
    - I believe Tschichold often used to set the paragraph beginning this way (but
    all small caps, including C, should be preferable, in my opinion). There's the
    same tracking in the small caps. Finally, the paragraph with no drop cap, no small
    caps: in most cases, I believe this setting works the best way. As of the matter
    about how many words should be set in small caps, in the begininnig of a paragraph,
    I think you should condiser the sense of the phrase. There was a thread months
    ago which dealt with the matter, got to find it and link it here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DROP_4255.jpg]"

  body: "The reason I like the drop cap at the beginning of the chapter is because
    for section breaks where it focuses on a different character in the same chapter,
    I use the second example (all small caps.) I also, like you said, enjoy the \"old\"
    quality it gives to the page when using a drop cap.\r\n\r\nI also noticed you
    changed the leading. Do you think that it is better with a smaller leading? Right
    now, I have it set to 11pt text with a 14pt leading. I felt that the page was
    able to breathe more. As I look at your examples, however, I do like the tighter
    qualty. "

  body: "A few observations:\r\n\r\nYou might consider picking a dedicated font for
    the drop caps. It need not be a display face or set of capitals <em>per se.</em>
    If your choice falls to Arno Pro Display for the task, you might select one of
    the heavier weights.\r\n\r\nMargin kerning: a character like C can hang ever so
    slightly in the margin; characters like T and V benefit even more from this practice.\r\n\r\nEach
    successive line of text should line up more or less neatly. There is sometimes
    a need to kern the first line closer, but the second line should come up to the
    bounding box of the drop cap. (In Nicola's first sample, the lines align, but
    the C is given too much space on the right side.)\r\n\r\nNick is correct about
    lining up the tops of the caps. The small caps can sometimes be just a hair lower,
    but not as low as you have placed them.\r\n\r\nAbout the design as a whole: you
    have burdened your opening with the word CHAPTER in all caps followed by a rule
    and the chapter number. This detracts significantly from the visual impression
    the drop cap is trying to make.\r\n\r\nInstead, try putting CHAPTER I in small
    caps at the same point size as your body. Or just use the roman numeral at a display
    size and dispense with the word <em>chapter.</em>\r\n\r\nAre your margins really
    that generous? If so, excellent! But move the folio down just a notch."

    tempted to increase the register of your design, without having first mastered
    the basic technique.\r\n\r\nLet us conceptualize a hierarchy of drop caps, with
    the proviso that in every case the end result must be related to the text face,
    and speak the same idiom.\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The text face at an increased point
    size (tradition dictates 3\xD7 larger)</li>\r\n<li>A different weight or display
    cut of the text face</li>\r\n<li>A related face with finer detail (such as Jenson
    if your text face is Arno)</li>\r\n<li>Titling capitals, calligraphic or inscriptional
    (e.g., Rialto, Sistina)</li>\r\n<li>Inline capitals (Castellar, Smaragd, Augustea
    Open)</li>\r\n<li>Decorated capitals / Ornamental initials</li>\r\n<li>Rubrics,
    illuminated capitals (etc.)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI have no first hand experience
    with the last of these. But you might look at the work of Petra Heidorn and Dieter
    Steffman at moorstation.org. Lanston Type Company may have something to offer
    (see http://p22.com), and a quick hunt on MyFonts turned up the name Gilles Le

  body: "Drop cap aside, I think the weakness on this page lies in the spatial relationships
    of text to sinkage to margins.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to evaluate in a spread,
    since this left-hand opener won\u2019t occur in isolation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all,
    the presence of a running head (book title, I presume?) is unorthodox on a chapter
    opener. Although it may be properly centered, because it is italic and because
    of the excessive word space in the chapter head, it looks disturbingly off center
    from the text/head. Its presence also makes the placement of the chapter head
    look too low. I would lose the running head.\r\n\r\nAnd Miller Italic (transitional/modern)
    with Arno (oldstyle)?? Sorry; doesn\u2019t work for me.\r\n\r\nWith this sink,
    the proportions of your text block are almost square, which makes for a pretty
    static element. And it doesn\u2019t feel well engaged with your overall page proportions
    and margins. I would try losing and dropping about four more lines (maybe even
    as much as that entire last paragraph). Then activate the sink area differently
    with your chapter title.\r\n\r\nThe margins may be generous, but unless you\u2019re
    going to be able to use a sewn binding (which I\u2019m guessing not \u2014 fantasy
    books don\u2019t generally get that kind of production), then that gutter margin
    looks way too tight to me. I suspect you\u2019re going to start losing your text
    blocks into the binding\_\u2014\_visually, if not literally \u2014 which is going
    to really mess up your classical page design.\r\n\r\nSeriously, trim your proofs
    and tuck them into a bound book or dummy and check how your margins work in three
    dimensions.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful perspective."

    to have titles, so you might reconsider how to introduce them.\r\n\r\nPlay with
    the weight and the positioning of the drop cap until it \"locks\" with the text
    block.\r\n\r\nEven of the context does not demand it, set everything up to the
    word \"capital\" in small caps. This will give a better idea of how the design
    will perform across multiple chapter openings. It is unusual for only the first
    opening word to get the small caps treatment."

    <li><em>Above: poster's most recent version; below, my modification.</em></li>
    </ul>\r\n\r\nFirstly, I don't like the optical alignment of column edges. It subverts
    the glyph metrics that have been designed into the font, and creates a soft column
    edge; metal-style typography should be hard.\r\n\r\nSecondly, tight spacing and
    kerning of small caps is wack/naff. The traditional look is for letterspaced capitals,
    and that includes small capitals. Furthermore, kerning small capitals creates
    wonky spacing--here the R_W is tight, but the W_Y is still cavernous. So in my
    modification, I have tracked out the small caps, and added letterspacing between
    \xC6 and R, R and W, and N and comma. Now this different parameter for small caps
    serves to distinguish it better from the U&lc setting, and makes it the same scale
    as U&lc: true small caps, not just shrunken capitals that are a bit beefier. Also,
    letterspacing of the small cap run-in harmonizes it better with the drop cap as
    a single word, with the letterspacing approximating the mini-gutter width between
    the drop cap and the three-line text indent.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the drop cap is,
    like all the best typography, supposed to imply the precision of an underlying
    grid/matrix/armature, because it's a reassuring recognition for the viewer to
    know that the work has been precisely assembled. Therefore, the bounds of the
    drop cap should define a square that aligns with the text matter at baseline,
    with the column edge at left, with the top of the small caps at top (also because
    the implication of \"caps with small caps\" is tacky and to be avoided at all
    costs), and at right be separated from the text matter by a clearly defined margin;
    this is why I have aligned \"\xC6\" with the two glyphs beneath it.\r\n\r\nAnd
    don't get me started on the Th ligature..."
