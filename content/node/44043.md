body: "I've got some odd behaviour testing my PostScript flavoured OpenType that I
  suspect is down to the naming of certain glyphs. I wondered if anybody could shed
  some light on where I've gone wrong. I spent a long time matching my glyphs to the
  exact spec in the FontLab manual too, so I'm a bit frustrated.\r\n\r\nIn InDesign
  some of my oldstyle numbers are jumbled. If I add a 1, say, I get a 2!\r\n\r\nIt
  could be down to bad Unicode names too. I used FontLab's Generate Unicode tool to
  populate as many Unicode points as possible. I'm wondering if that was my bum move.\r\n\r\nTesting
  with FontQA does bring up naming issues though, listing the following as errors.
  \r\n\r\nAll my small caps, which are named, <em>A.smcp</em> etc.\r\nAll my proportional
  lining numbers, named <em>zero.fitted</em> etc.\r\nAll my tabular oldstyle numbers,
  named <em>zero.taboldstyle</em> etc.\r\nAnd all my proportional oldstyle numbers,
  named <em>zero.onum</em> etc.\r\n\r\nLooking now, <em>zero.taboldstyle</em> seems
  to be an erroneous format, but then, the others fail the FontQA test too. Maybe
  <em>zero.taboldstyle</em> and <em>zero.onum</em> are in fact equivalent, which may
  explain InDesign's confusion.\r\n\r\nHmm. I'm stuck I suppose. Anyone able to suggest
  what the names should actually be?"

  body: "While I don't much care for your naming scheme, I don't think that is it.
    I think it is simply that you have a mixup in your classes, so that \"two.something\"
    is the second member of one class, where \"one.somethingelse\" is the second member
    of the others.\r\n\r\nJust a WAG.\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth, I (following John
    Hudson, I believe) use one.op (for one, oldsyle proportional), one.lp (for one,
    lining proportional), one.lt (one, lining tabular), and of course, one.ot (for
    one, oldstyle tabular)\r\n\r\nThere is a limit to the total length of the names,
    and if you get too prolix, you'll hit it fast.\r\n"

    think small caps are supposed to be mapped to lowercase character names (e.g.,

    wrong. As I understand it, the point is when, say, text is extracted from a PDF,
    the period & what follows drop out. So, if you had n.smcp c.smcp a.smcp a.smcp,
    you'd get ncaa. But N.smcp C.smcp A.smcp A.smcp would go to NCAA. Kansas would
    be happier.\r\n\r\nMost small caps should map to caps if small caps aren't available. "

  body: But thats just in the special case of initials/acronyms that for whatever
    reason are not written in all caps separated with periods (the grammatically correct
    but typographically ugly way). Any other situation where small caps are used for
    various sorts of emphasis or what have you, where they might appear along side
    a regular cap in proper nouns (or any noun in German), should the small caps then
    not map to the lower case?

  body: "> <em>Most small caps should map to caps if small caps aren\u2019t available.</em>\r\n\r\nSmall
    caps should map to whatever case they started from. If you're getting small caps
    by styling lowercase, then the glyphs should map to lowercase. The same applies
    to uppercase. This is the reason why our fonts have two sets of small cap glyphs,
    which in terms of features are treated like this,\r\n<code>\r\nfeature c2sc {
    # Small caps from caps\r\nsub A by A.sc;\r\n} c2sc;\r\n\r\nfeature smcp { # Small
    caps from lowercase\r\nsub a by a.sc;\r\n} smcp;\r\n</code>\r\n"

    I've opted for A.sc zero.ot etc. I appreciate the brevity.\r\n\r\nHaving changed
    these and recompiled the font my issues have resolved. Mind you I think the glyph
    palette in InDesign CS3 (Mac) is a bit buggy as it has crashed the entire app
    more than a couple of times now \u2013- and not just using my own font.\r\n\r\nI've
    learnt, too having seen the discussion about small caps. So, thanks all."
