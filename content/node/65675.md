  than two dozen glyphs are NOT online, but solid black:\r\n\r\nsee www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Helvetica-75-outline.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
  is highly interesting, because the seemlingly same outline font sold by Linotype
  does NOT have these faults.\r\n\r\nThis means that (at least some of the) seemingly
  identical fonts sold both by Adobe and Linotype are NOT identical, so that it make
  a difference from where you get them.\r\n"

    version was lacking numerous glyphs. Later Adobe inserted bold solid glyphs instead
    of bold outline glyphs to complement the missing glyphs, whereas Linotype inserted
    outline glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe entire font family \"Neue Helvetica\", publicized in
    a 1984 Linotype catalog, is now public domain. This includes the outline style
    too, which also appeared 25 years ago."

  body: "@ Uli\r\n\r\nIt is true, that fonts with the same names, that come from Adobe,
    Linotype, Monotype and ITC are not necessarily the same.\r\n\r\nITC Galliard Std
    sold by Adobe, does not contain old style figures, superiors, inferiors and more.
    ITC Galliard Std sold by ITC does contain these characters.\r\n\r\nExcept from
    that there can be big differences in the quality of the hinting, dependent from
    where you buy the fonts. Linotype does not care as much as Adobe about hinting.
    The appearance on screen can be big, dependent from where you buy the fonts.\r\n\r\nSo,
    if you want to buy a font, that is available from two or more foundries, you have
    to compare them, although the fonts have exactly the same name.\r\n\r\n"

    Helvetica\" belongs to the 400 additional Linotype fonts which will enter the

  body: What if I approach Linotype and ask them, please can I have (for the sake
    of argument) DIN 1451? Surely they'll tell me to get lost. And doesn't a normal
    EULA preclude me from sharing a font legally. Are you telling me that an EULA
    will laspe after a certain amount of time? Will someone explain clearly what this
    means (or at least what Uli thinks it means) in practice for a font designer?

  body: "If Uli is actually correct about this it will be huge boon to the Open Source
    font movement (assuming they can actually find copies of the original font files).
    Sure they\u2019ll have to change the trademarked names, but that never stopped
    anyone. Getting people to design complex families for free is pretty tough, but
    I doubt they\u2019ll have a hard time getting some people to convert these to
    bring the old files into Fontforge, expand the character sets to cover the entire
    range of Latin characters, and generate new OT fonts. Once the procedure is in
    place a small team could just keep banging them out. It will takes years to get
    through them all, but it will happen."

    works on [[http://www.classicalmusicmobile.com|Classical Music Mobile]], a website
    with a banner that states, \"Legal Music Only.\" The site offers MP3s taken from
    sound recordings that are out of copyright. The files are not free, but the usual
    price is only \u20AC1 per work, regardless of length. The following explanation
    appears on the website: \"Internationally, sound recordings are protected for
    50 years from the end of the year in which they were first released (in the USA,
    the legislation depends on the States). That means, any recording published or
    released to the public before 1959 is now out of copyright, i.e. in the public
