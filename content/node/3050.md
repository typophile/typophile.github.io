  tshirt: <a href="http://www.emigre.com/Tshirt.php?id=3" target="_blank">http://www.emigre.com/Tshirt.php?id=3</a>
  &#41; for a ski team. they want something very traditional, but i cant even think
  of what type face to start working off of. i suppose any hints on how to obtain
  that &#34;look&#34; would be helpful as well. has anyone ever done a job like this?
  should i just be hand lettering this whole thing? <BR> <BR>thanks.'

    double post in design? that seems evil. <BR> <BR>no budget, but might be willing
    to drop some of my own money if its not too expensive.
