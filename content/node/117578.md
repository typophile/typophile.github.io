  has been changed? or it is a problem in the programming?  anyone knows please? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

    font that you built from scratch? Or an existing font that you opened and altered
    in FontLab?\r\nAnd more importantly, are there any OpenType features in the font?\r\n\r\n"

    glyphs, and how you did it; (2) what app(s) you have seen the incorrect behavior
    in.\r\n\r\nThen, one would want to simply look at the misbehaving font, which
    would be much quicker than trying to guess at the problem."
