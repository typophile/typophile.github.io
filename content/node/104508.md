    /a. Actually, I really doubt it could be a font, more a custom logo work.\r\nMy
    2 cent now. To me, they could have started with Helvetica Neue, replaced /o by
    a circle (link with icon?) and tried (and failed) to make this type memorable
    by tweaking /a.\r\nBTW, what the font did they use to write \"a [...] company\"?
    Avenir x DIN? Could be a track to follow...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/google_company_6558.jpg]"

  body: Thanks Akira for Regular! And that could even be the base font for the logo.
    It'd just needs to tweak /a a bit.
