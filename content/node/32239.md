body: "Is there a way to setup MS Word so that if I am using a regular weight of a
  font and press the Bold button, Word will select the correct bold font and not \"fake\"
  bold the regular weight? The same would hold true for the italic button.\r\n\r\nI
  am setting up some forms for my wife's business, and while I am used to selecting
  the proper font weights from the font menu when in InDesign, my wife and most of
  corporate workers are used to pressing the bold and italic buttons and not thinking
  twice about it.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I have already tried to train her to use the font
  menu to select the correct weight and not use the buttons. I've only just gotten
  her to stop using 2 spaces after a sentence."

    \ you will get the correct Bold, Italic, Regular or Bold Italic if they exist
    for the Font Family. \r\n\r\nIf they do not exist they are 'faked' "

  body: That's weird, because I have Gotham loaded and if I am typing in Book and
    hit the bold button, I get fake bold.

  body: I think it has to do with the names of the font files, i.e. Word only recognises
    them if they're named as it wants them to.
