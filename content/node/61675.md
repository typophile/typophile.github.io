  paper on Netherlands,France and Japan. Does anyone have any idea about the typeface

    which started as a custom typeface for RATP and has since developed into a rather
    large family.\r\n\r\nTokyo I think uses various styles of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nBTW
    such questions are usually better served on the <a href=\"typophile.com/typeid\">Type
    ID Board</a>."
