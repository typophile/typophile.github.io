  on the \u201CBerner Specimen\u201D.\r\n\r\nOf course I know, that this must be at
  least the n-th Garamond, but until today there is no such font available under an
  opensource licence, so I decided to try to fill this gap.\r\n\r\nI want it to be
  as close to the original as possible but of course I make compromises where necessary
  to keep it usable. In the end (which might be far from now), I plan to have a family
  with different optical sizes and so on. For now it\u2019s text size and roman only
  (and some first tries with the italic). Latin and basic cyrillic are present, greek
  will follow later.\r\n\r\nI really would like your critique and comments about the
  font. You can get it from www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/EBGaramond.otf\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Georg\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nSince end of march, EB Garamond is available from Google
  webfonts for embedding."

  body: Very nice start. At least on-screen (in the specimen and on your website,
    which I'm guessing is using EB Garamond through @font-face) in Linux, it looks
    pretty darn nice already. Beyond offering encouragement, the only recommendation
    I'd make at this point would be to consider also support SIL's Graphite smartfont
    technology in your font. While it only works with TTF fonts, it has the advantage
    of being the only Smartfont system supported by OpenOffice and LibreOffice...

  body: With fractional point coordinates, a cumulative decimal place rounding error
    can displace the endpoint from the position of the beginning point, thus causing
    this jog. in FontForge, Element>Round>To Int snaps the point to grid for a selected
    point or all points in the glyph if none are selected, and solves this displacement
    on the endpoint.

    Graphite would indeed be interesting at least as long as there is no proper support

  body: "I've checked your PDF. One think that I've seen is the different placing
    of caron on /\u011B/ and /\u017E/. On the latter it's positioned higher. Make
    sure it's the same on all letters otherwise it becomes very distracting for readers.
    But otherwise I still think they're quite tall on lower case letters. I don't
    know if you've made then thinner later, but in the PDF they also seem to be quite
    heavy.\r\n\r\nRegarding the shape of /s/ it's still a bit to the right. Draw a
    line vertical line over it and you'll maybe see it better. Or have two of them
    side by side: one in original form and the other horizontally flipped. If the
    flipped one looks leaning to the left, it means the original is leaning to the
    right.\r\n\r\nBut if you don't change it it'll probably be just fine because in
    text it looks quite fine. I can see it others may not. So it's not that off any
    more. It's in acceptable range. The last change makes it even more appropriate.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    I really like what you've done to the small caps Eszett/Scharfes S. Very slick

    I have reduced weight and hight of the h\xE1\u010Dek, as you can see (I\u2019ll
    do the same for circumflex later).\r\n\r\nThe h\xE1\u010Deks over e and z do have
    the same height. I do diacritic positioning by anchors so the vertical position
    is transparently controllable with feature files. If you see a difference it\u2019s
    either a presentation problem (screen, hinting or the like) or an optical illusion.
    If the latter is the case and is reproduceable for others too, I should think
    about changing anchor positions for some letters.\r\n\r\nAs for the smcp Eszett,
    this glyph was the beginning of my learning to draw letters. As it is missing
    in most of the typefaces I started to draw it for different ones. It\u2019s not
    a very useful one (seldomly used, and if you use it, people will stumble over
    it), but I really love it :) The one for EB Garamond was drawn very early in the
    whole proces and barely touched since then (about 9 months ago) so one might deduce
    from it some learning proces :)\r\n\r\nBTW, the specimen has slovenian text now
