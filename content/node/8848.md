body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I am looking to ID the typeface used in the intertitles from
  Fritz Lang&#39;s classic silent film &#34;Metropolis&#34; &#40;1927&#41;. These
  shots are from the DVD of the recently restored edition &#40;I did not capture them,
  only grabbed them from DVDbeaver.com&#41;; I don&#39;t know if they are identical
  to the face used in the original film. <BR> <BR>Also, these shots don&#39;t highlight
  certain capitals &#40;such as &#34;T&#34;&#41; that show some vestiges of blackletter
  styling. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63782.jpg"
  alt="Auf Deutsch"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63783.jpg"
  alt="English Version"> <BR> <BR>As an aside, the restored DVD also uses Thesis &#40;I
  think, or something like it&#41; in the extra intertitles added to represent missing
  footage. <BR> <BR>Additional images can be seen at &#60;<a href="http://www.articles.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare7/metropolis2.htm"

  <BR> <BR>BTW, the quality of the restored film is exceptional. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: The top sample looks hand-lettered to me - although the bottom looks more
    regular, might be a font.

  body: It reminds me a bit of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/claustrum/"
    target="_blank">T-26 Claustrum</a>, but I can see it&#39;s not the same. <BR>
    <BR>It is definitely a font or a typeface, because the letters are identical &#40;to
    my eye, at least&#41;. <BR> <BR>I will do some more hunting.

  body: I  suppose I should take back my comment about the identical lettering. Even
    I can see that there are at least 2 r&#39;s.  This does not rule out a font, and
    I think you&#39;d agree the lettering is remarkably uniform.

  body: It&#39;s highly likely that the original film used hand-lettering; was using
    machine-made type even possible on film in the 1920s? <BR> <BR>For the restored
    version on DVD, I suspect that the English version at least was done with digital
    type. It&#39;s possible that the German version retained and restored the original
    hand lettering. <BR> <BR>FWIW, these samples stymied WhatTheFont and Identifont.

    <BR>It was possible and there were even special typefaces made for this use, but
    hand lettering was very common in early film titles. Maybe because it was more
    flexible and/or cheaper.

  body: Have you noticed the kerning? Some of the glyphs are &#40;almost&#41; touching
    each other and some even have a bit of overlap. Doing that with type would be
    impossible &#40;or at least extremely hard to do&#41;. <BR>I don&#39;t know whether
    other techniques were available at the time, but I think this was handlettered
    &#40;by someone with a very steady hand, but that&#39;s not unheard of -- twenty
    years ago comic lettering artists had that!&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW I myself failed
    at lettering comics, because I would get carried away by the story and the activity
    and my lettering would change so much in the course of a few pages, that my client
    thought I had some of it done by somebody else. I got paid a rejection fee. He
    used my lettering, though. Bummer, that.

    reshot after constructing the title. <BR>Tim
