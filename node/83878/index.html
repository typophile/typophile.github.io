  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, as those who've seen my posts already know, I am at best a small fish wandering north in a fierce southward river when it comes to my skills in typography. 

I wish to submit to all here for advice a font I recently found. I am a Classics major, and so have to deal with Polyphonic Greek as well as Latin. The font I have found is called GFS Didot, and am wondering what all of your opinion on this particular font is. What I mean is, what is its quality as a font, and what, if any, form of publication this font would be suitable for. 

I ask because I have grown to like *subtle* modern serifs, and this seems as such (think kind of like Kepler - Didone style but Old Style charm). My own personal problem with this is that the lowercase "t" is a bit too short for my taste, but that is venial. 

Also, what fonts would work well in pairing with this, if it is suitable for publication uses?

Thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Futura and Helvetica (both sans) are some I've used in the past with Didot.

But seeing your examples a bit closer, yours is a very different version of what I've seen before.

As to what I (personally) think about Didot, for some reason I associate it with fashion magazines. Go figure… I see it as a very elegant/formal/serious typeface. And I love the contrast between roman and italics.

Hope it helps!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, this is not GFS Didot.

GFS Didot is a Greek-only version made by George Matthiopoulos and based on scannings of Didot original work with Greek script. The font is freely [[http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces19th.html|available]] and has good quality.

The images you posted shows a font with several problems, built from different origins in a Didone style. Figures were taken from GFS Didot. Latin uppercase glyphs present in Greek alphabet seem to be modified versions of GFS Didot. S is a badly modified Palatino glyph. Ampersand is completely non-Didone. And lowercase is a low-quality mix, with contrast and stress not Modern at all. You are right about t: it is really too short.

It seems someone took GFS Didot and tried to add Latin script to it. But the result is not good.

I like to combine Didones with grotesques and neogrotesques, especially condensed cuts. Modern fonts became firmly associated with fashion and women-related publications because Vogue established a standard on this many decades ago. Health and tourism publications also use to adopt Didones.

You can find several quality versions of Didot and Bodoni, not to mention other Modern variants, like Scotch.</div>
