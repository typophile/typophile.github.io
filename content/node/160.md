  body: Yves? Are you sleeping? Chesh? Stephen? I can&#39;t find it. Koloss was my
    first thought, but it isn&#39;t close enough. Unless you can change several characters.

  body: Boy, I&#39;m stumped. I&#39;m guessing it isn&#39;t available digitally, like
    it&#39;s only a sign-painter&#39;s font. Maybe it&#39;s in one of Dan Solo&#39;s
    books? Also, he recently released digital versions of his fonts. Take a look at
    the <a href="http://typographi.ca/000510.php">Typographica</a> post on the subject.

  body: No, it&#39;s not any sort of Radiant modification. The characters in the sample
    have slightly rounded edges, and the G is very different from Radiant.

  body: It looks to me to be a sign painter&#39;s hand variant of one of the above.
    I don&#39;t know if you will match it exactly. Possibly something at <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com"
    target="_blank">LetterHead Fonts</a> might be close. May even want to consult
    with them on this one!

  body: This one bugged me, so I did some experimentation with E&#43;F Radiant Display
    Condensed No. 1. There is so many versions of Radiant out there, there might be
    a better match, but its close enough to close the case in my opinion. Scaled 70
    % on the horizontal and with some extra outline/fatness and rounded corners. Voil

  body: The font was &#34;cut&#34; by a signwriter, using signblazer.... And as far
    as I know, not modified, the original graphic was a photopraph, touched up a little
    for clarity..<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/11146.jpg"
