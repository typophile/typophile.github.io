  fonts. And it\u2019s looking like a damned long, time consuming process.\r\n\r\nSo
  I am just throwing this font out there\u2026\r\nhttp://www.woodardworks.com/type13.html\r\nI\u2019ll
  post new versions as I process whatever advice and critique you typophiles might
  generously provide.\r\n\r\nLaconic is my attempt at the basics. A super simple physical
  design in three weights with as many OT features as I could deal with. They all
  work on my system (mac) but I\u2019m sure they still need a lot of work to conform
  to proper cross platform OT code. \r\n\r\nI started playing with the physical design
  of Laconic while reading some of the bitmap pixel font threads. After a while I
  backed off the idea of making an actual pixel font (way too confining) and designed
  a font that only LOOKED like it conformed to a really tight grid. I tried to keep
  curves and diagonals down to a bare minimum and still be legible. \r\n\r\nI know
  it\u2019s dry but I think it has a little bit of charm and it\u2019s a great place
  to start with the whole OT features programming thing.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Robby,\r\nPretty cool. It is not as exciting as some of your other faces,
    but it works. The capital C stood out to me, I think the hook at the top terminal
    is a little out of place, or clunky. Also the 3 and 8 feel a little awkward. When
    I was working on numerals, I tried like, 3 variations of each, to try to fit them
    with the rest of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nI hear you about the OT programming. I'm
    a beginner with type design, but I love it. I'm still in school, so it's hard
    to devote that kind of time on a side project.\r\n\r\nYour website is pretty flashy;
    pun intended. I like the animated logos, it adds character to them. I was thinking,
    it looks like you are a Flash master, so it shouldn't be too hard  for you to
    learn OpenType features.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nTerrance"

  body: its really nice the c reminds of rotis i like it. only thing i can say is
    that quark doesn't support stylistic alternates some people put them under swashes
    or contextual alternates. its annoying. all the other features work fine on my
    system.

  body: "Nice work, I like the bold - it has a good presence. If it was designed with
    screen use in mind (as pixel fonts are) you may need to address some of the hinting
    problems.\r\n\r\nM"

  body: 'Re: OpenType... Be mindful of your feature order, and keep it consistent
    among the weights. Putting fractions at the end of the chain means that activating
    any other feature that substitutes figures will override the fractions. If that''s
    not desired, you could simply move ''frac'' further up in the ranks. Another option
    would be to include the tabular and oldstyle figures within the fraction substitutions.'

  body: "Hinting seems to work pretty well in my apps. I'm not really trying to make
    it a true screen font.\r\n\r\nI did find a couple feature order problems and fixed
    them. I didn't realize the order was critical. Also I put the frac feature above
    sups and sinf in all three.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!"
