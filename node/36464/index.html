  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone, 

I’m brand new to the forum but in need of some help! (I posted this in the design section but was kindly referred here)

I designed my own business card while I was still at university, and was pleased with it at the time, but it is beginning to show it’s age!

The card consisted of a rendered 3d letter “e” with a black background. On the right side of the card, I wrote my name and details in white with Magneto for my font. Have a look below. It’s just not doing it for me. I am a video editor/3d animator living in London. I want to convey a modern, smooth image, without being too “out-there” for the average person that I might give my card to. I am still generally happy with this background image, but I welcome any and all advice in regards to colours, layout, font (ESPECIALLY font), etc.

I humbly thank you in advance for taking the time to help me!

		<div class="commentbody">First off, I'd suggest using a typeface that's a little more readable at small sizes.

Because you do 3D animation, I think that the 3D render on the card might be a good idea, especially if you're going with a CMYK card. If you're keeping it, you might want to keep at least your name set in Magneto. I don't know if the vector version is necessary, and I might put the dots above and below the 'E' in "Erven" instead.

Play around with it and post your progress.

The coloured 3d logo is a strong image, therefore you should leave ample space around it, and set the text in a neutral typeface. (Could be Linotype Univers, Bliss, or something just as simple.

Here is a quickly-made vertical and horizontal version (in a larger size) with a simpler font. I tried november's suggestion of Univers.

I also abandoned the vector "e". There is perhaps too much blank space but I plan on putting a phone number in there somewhere. 

I also plan on making one with the name still in Magneto with the dots as Lex suggested to tie my name and the logo together. 

What do you think?

maybe you could change the background colour- give it a brownish tint.- see what it looks like
you should also change the horizontal scale of that @. 
You could also try and give it some typographic colour- by this i mean different thicknesses

		<div class="commentbody">I like chuckgroth's horizontal, cropped version. Cropping was an improvement.

If I should take it from there, i would try:

01
Scale down the 3d image approx 15%, so that (a) the uppermost edge of the 3d image not reaches the top edge of the card, and (b)the southwest corner of the card just shows a tiny bit of background (ie: you should be able to see the roundness of the 3d image down in this corner)

02
Write all the text in the same size, which should be fairly small (ie the size of the email address or a bit larger)

03
Lose the idea of having flush right type 'mirror' the right edge of 3d image ... make it flush left instead, and use the 15-odd % scaling of the image and the downsizing of the type to get ample space between the two elements

04
Write all the text without emphasizing with small caps or blank lines ... you only got three lines - no need to diffenrentiate anything, people can easily navigate through the information ... and the more minimalistic the type, the more exclusive it gets. (And the more 'boring' the type, the more interesting the 3d image. This is my main point: let the image steal the scene!

05
Just to pursue this line of thought, you COULD try to change the colour of the type to light grey ... 15-20 % black or something

06
No matter if the type is grey or white - if you scale it down like I suggested, remember to give a few units of space between all letters

07
In the same line of thought: you COULD try to write everything with lowercase ...

08
BTW - how is the card going to be produced? Colour printer? Or offset printing ... this may influence some of the choices you make ... eg the colouring of the type

09
Yes, I guess I am a minimalist ... ;.)

personally, i prefer the back side blank on a business card - so i would try to put all the type on the front (making the univers condensed was a right move imho) and then scale it down a little bit more if necessary. see how it looks. if it looks bad, then put it on the back side, but then i would certainly not place it right in the middle, rather i would place it nearer to the bottom edge - and definitely in a smaller point size.

if you place all the text on the front side, ie four lines, then you could try emphasizing the first line, your nane, by writing it in univers condensed bold (and the three remaining lines in univers condensed regular)</div>

yeah, come to think of it - it would be ackward if you should take a photocopy of the business card to get the info ... and then had to copy both sides ... 

but why put your name on both sides? rather, leave it blank - then there is the possibility of writing a note on the back, you know: "Hey, I'll just write my new mobile phone number on the back for you... "</div>

I think I'm sold on the nice clean-looking front. So I've opted for a two-sided card, with all of my details (including my name) on the back.

		<div class="commentbody">yeah, much better. my suggestions:

01
on the back side: i think you suffer somewhat from 'horror vacui' - i mean you let the type get almost as big as it can, and you go right up to top edge and right down to the bottom as well ... it's as if you want to stretch whatever there is on a page, so that it can fill it completely ...
how about scaling down the type to, say, 80-85 percent ... and then placing it 5 mm from right edge and 5 mm from bottom edge - without the blank lines.

02
what happened to @ in your e-mail adress ... couldn't you condense that, too?

03
i don't think the telephone symbol goes well with univers - couldn't you just write 'P'?
(actually, you don't need anything ... just as you don't need a symbol or a letter for the e-mail address or the web)

04
on the front side: i would like the type to be scaled down here too - and to be placed in the southeast area (as it is now, i think it is too close to the logo)</div>

The gloss on the front and plain back makes for a nice contrast. Have a look below. Thanks again for all the help you provided!
