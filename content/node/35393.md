  unveiled its new design three months ago. The typefaces used all are The Font Bureau,
  Inc. fonts: Miller Daily, Benton Sans and Escrow. I already noticed it back when
  the new style premiered, but it recently struck me again how badly those otherwise
  perfectly fine faces are mistreated. Read the entry on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=179\">Unzipped</a>

  body: "Yves, I just posted there.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the designers are wrestling
    with the pagination system, so it would be unfair to blame them for circumstances
    which are beyond their control.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I suspect that the pagination
    system sets the word space value, which may account for the excessive word spacing
    in some heads, if their editor has asked for plenty of word space in the body
    text. Similarly, if the pagination system places restrictions on the number of
    kern pairs, then some will go missing.\r\n\r\nThese are issues for the paper's
    designers to sort out with their IT department, the editor, the publisher, and
    the pagination system supplier -- it may take a while. At least they have progressed
    to the next level by implementing fonts where these kinds of subtle typographic
    distinctions are relevant!"

  body: "the papers at which i've designed used scitex and harris systems, and you're
    right -- they can be pretty funky at times.\r\nbut i think that several months
    in, at least some of the glaring issues should have been addressed unless someone
    either <em>doesn't see it </em> or, worse <em>doesn't think it matters.</em>  both
    can sometimes be true at newspapers."
