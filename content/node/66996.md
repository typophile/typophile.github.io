body: "I'm pretty new at working with fontlab, and i have been searching the web for
  tutorials, the manual is horrible, 'learning fontlab fast' was usefull but lacks
  depth (and is a complete eyesore). I found some usefull stuff on youtube, but i
  need more before i can continue.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know if there are better tutorials
  that provide a little more depth?\r\n\r\n\r\nfor instance with class kerning and
  metrics (i'm allergic to code, but this looks doable), is anyone actually using
  that? Cause it looks like a great way to get the basics right, but i'm not sure
  if i will be able to undo it without ruining what i did so far.\r\n\r\nsome help
  please"

    I found it useful for myself. The are also some videos on OpenType ligatures on
    the same Vimeo channel.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"i'm not sure if i will be able to undo
    it without ruining what i did so far\"</cite>\r\nIn that case just make a copy
    of your .vfb file and work with that until you're confident to go back to your
    original file. That's what I do, especially when I'm trialling out something new.\r\n\r\nDomenico."
