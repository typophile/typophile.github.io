body: "So this is my first attempt at a full-fledged typeface. I'm using this as an
  educational tool, so I've kept it very simple and maybe somewhat generic. Not all
  of the characters have been created at this point, but I can already see that there
  are issues I'm having a bit of trouble resolving. I'm hoping more experienced eyes
  can help me identify where some of the issues are coming from and how to fix them.
  There are three f's and two n's because I'm not sure which ones work best (if any).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like it! A few remarks:\r\nthe flag on /r/ is too narrow; make it higher
    (not wider)\r\nthere's generally little contrast which will make it hard to read
    in small sizes. Try enlarging the contrast. For example, the join between the
    bowl of n and the left stem is very fat. Try thinning it. Also, it looks like
    that same bowl is fatter than the stem, which is unusual. /u/ is too wide (compare
    to /n/). Diagonals on /k/ are too thin. Dot on /i/ is too small.\r\nKeep it up!\r\n"

    have those changes and the full alphabet done tomorrow.
