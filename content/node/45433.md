  body: "Mike, this one has been keeping me hunting, and I have looked in at least
    seven books, including McGrew's book on Metal Type, but I can't seem to find anything
    with these traits, even though it has a familiar look. How old is 'vintage' in
    this case?\r\n\r\nIt looks like late 19th century to me, and the lower case resembles
    DeVinne No. 11 shown in Jaspert, but the M and R don't fit that at all. \r\n\r\n-
    Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike and Lex,\r\nWow! Thank you for helping.\r\n\r\nThis is from a book
    dating to the mid- to late-1800s.\r\n\r\nI've been searching a lot too, and have
    yet to be successful.\r\n\r\nDrat! I hate being stumped.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate
    your efforts and maybe the answer is yet to come.\r\n\r\nThank you for helping!"
