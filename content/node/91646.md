body: "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\r\n\r\n<strong>Monotype Imaging Holdings (NASDAQ: TYPE)
  a Delaware, USA corporation founded as Lanston Monotype Machine Company in 1887
  acquires Lotus F1 for USD 50 billion in cash.</strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monolotus1_5326.jpg]\r\n<em>The
  new livery seen during testing ahead of the Shanghai Grand Prix.</em>\r\n\r\nFormer
  Lotus F1 owner Proton was unavailable for comment on its divestiture, however sources
  close to Monotype indicate that driver Romain Grosjean, contracted to Lotus F1 for
  an undisclosed number of seasons was the type founder\u2019s principal intended
  asset acquisition. According to recent research by Dr. Shelby Greendler, head of
  the Communication & Edumacation Program at Lambada College in Vancouver, Canada,
  Grosjean is a direct descendant of both Philippe Grandjean, the personal typeface
  engraver of French monarch Louis XIV, and famed former Monotype employee Beatrice
  Warde (resulting from an extramarital affair while using the assumed identity of
  Paul Beaujon).\r\n\r\nGreendler has further uncovered that Grosjean changed his
  surname from Grandjean in order to evade persecution by Alphabetties, a typeface
  aficionado group seen by some as a shadowy militant-feminist font cult engaged in
  stalking masculine type designers. Five court cases against Alphabetties members
  are currently pending and the Type Directors Club of New York is eagerly anticipating
  its key figures to face arrest as early as May of 2023. In a controversial allegation
  however Greendler has been fingered as a secret founder of Alphabetties, with detractors
  claiming she is now running a splinter paramilitary training operation known as
  Type Kamp.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monolotus2_6401.jpg]\r\n<em>Press
  photo of Romain Grosjean.</em>\r\n\r\nGrosjean, a covert member of Association Typographique
  Internationale welcomed Monotype\u2019s acquisition, revealing his previously undisclosed
  ambition of eventually moving up from his Super-License to designing fonts. However
  team sponsors Renault S. A., Clear Anti-Dandruff and Rexona Deodorant have expressed
  concern that the move might adversely impact their ability to leverage their own
  typographic assets. Renault in particular is threatening legal action centered on
  former employee Pierre \xC9tienne B\xE9zier\u2019s reputed patents covering the
  mathematical definition of curves, which Renault claims are relevant to a few Monotype
  fonts.\r\n\r\nConcerning the future of Grosjean team-mate Kimi R\xE4ikk\xF6nen,
  sources within the Formula 1 industry indicate that renewal of his driving contract
  is contingent upon a change of name to Italique H\xE4m\xE4l\xE4inen. However according
  to the same sources R\xE4ikk\xF6nen\u2019s manager Steve Robertson has made it clear
  that his client would not accede to being a subordinate driver.\r\n\r\nhmp\r\n"

  body: I'm sure the superstars in the type design world could not care less what
    Monotype spends their cash on so long as the company keeps paying their royalties
    on time. A spokesman for the Professional Type Designer's Coalition said the cost
    of upkeep on their Gold Coast mansions continues to escalate so many of the designers
    are now having to work four days a week just to keep royalty income at a reasonable
    level. Even with those additional hours, reportedly two of the designers have
    had to sell their personal jets.

  body: 'The obvious reason for Monotype to acquire Lotus is to gain residency in
    the Principality of Monaco. The majority of F1 drivers live there since there
    are no taxes due to the revenues from the casino. But you cannot merely move there,
    you must be approved by a member of the Royal family. If the principals at Monotype
    are able to leverage their team ownership in this manner and are approved to live
    there then type designers all over the world can consider applying to become residents
    of Monaco in order to dodge taxes on their vast incomes. Plus there are all those
    free tickets to F1 events which are worth their weight in gold. '
