body: "Does a dotless i serve any purpose in an all-caps display face? Specifically,
  should I stick \u201CI\u201D into the dotlessi glyph to avoid causing any issues
  for end-users, or is it just useless?"

  body: are you including lowercase characters in your font (abc in addition to ABC)?
    if so, i would include the dotless i as a duplicate of the letter I. if not, then
    no.

  body: If you want people to be able to typeset Turkish, you should include it. (And
    you should include a dotted capital I, which is also required in Turkish, and
    which I just a couple of minutes ago used in a bibliography.)

  body: Also, since it is its own character,it would be useful to have in there for
    people who need to copy and paste text that might just have that. Otherwise you
    either get nothing or a notdef symbol.
