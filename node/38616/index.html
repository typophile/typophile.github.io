This is a huge long shot and I know this isn't the Adobe support board but... this is slightly type related.
I am making some short videos for Typecon in a 30 day trial of Adobe After Effects CS3. And While it is a hellaciously cool and powerful program it also seems to be hellaciously buggy. The error I keep getting is cutting into my productivity is and so it is putting the project into real jeprody.
The error itself is ' overflow converting ratio denominators ( 17:: 19 ) '
There are very few references online regarding this error but all of them suggest that the error is associated with pushing the limits of memeory with 2 hour long projects with huge file sizes. This project is the opposite. Super short & very small data sizes for the cast members. The time on the project is 9 min. It does use a Sound file ( 4.5 Megs )
In case it is of any help - what I am doing is panning over and fading in and out of photos and Jpegs of Fonts.
The one idea I had which was to update the trial version from 8.0.0.298 to 8.0.2 did not work probably because the trial version is not eligible for the upgrade.
Thanks!

<div class=commentbody>Very common problem. See this solution <a href=http://forums.creativecow.net/thread/2/917034>Creative Cow:</a>
my solution was to create a composition from one of the AE presets first and then tweak the settings slightly to match my movie properties. Adding my movie clip to this composition gives me no errors and we're good to go.

Better idea: try their new deal (till next month) — PPK: Pay Per Keyframe. That said, you have the full version for a limited time :^)
