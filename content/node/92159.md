body: I'm looking for a font similar to Hoefler & Frere Jones' Forza (http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041)
  but available in a web font. Linotype's Eurostile is very close, (though the lower
  case letters are smaller in x-height when compared to Forza) and there aren't the
  variety of weights available in Eurostile that make Forza so versatile. Anyone have
  suggestions?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forza_06_6709.png]
