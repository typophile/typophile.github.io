  1"> <BR> <BR>Hello, I want to make a personalized copy of the title page of the
  magazine &#34;Gala&#34; &#40;<a href="http://www.gala.de" target="_blank">http://www.gala.de</a>&#41;
  for my girl friend. Can you tell me what types they used for the logo and the headlines?
  Or maybe you could give a hint which similar types I could use. Thank you very much,
  Moritz. <BR>
