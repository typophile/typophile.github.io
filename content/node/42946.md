    a search</a>.\r\nThe fonts used in Wallpaper magazine came up a couple of times
    before. Without sample, I just can guess: maybe <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/38022\">Plakat</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/1875\">Amplitude</a>, both  by [[Christian
    Schwartz]].\r\n\r\nF"

    Unfortunately, I find both names not very memorable. \u2018Plakat\u2019 is the
    German word for poster, and \u2018Graphik\u2019 \u2026 well, you can guess that."
