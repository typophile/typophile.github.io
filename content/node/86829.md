  been stylised with the removal of parts of some letters but it seems to be a common
  font which I can't pinpoint.\r\n\r\nThe closer I've managed to find would be some
  altered version of Hoefler Text.\r\n\r\n[[http://delapubmaispasque.fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Diesel.jpg|(example)]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
