body: "How can design give you a hangover?\r\n\r\nSimple. Somebody decides to leave
  a company you used to work for, they throw a party and invite you because you know
  them better than the bosses do. Throw the party on a Thursday night. Ex-bosses throw
  plenty of cash at the barman then make a swift exit leaving you and the remaining
  typoholic heros to down a few rounds of \xABSambuca con mosca\xBB. The inevitable
  rush for the pool table raises spirits and adrenalin levels. Testosterone rampant
  as each male fights it out for chest-beating glory. You win. You lose the next morning
  as you sit in work, bleary-eyed with re-runs of Woody Woodpecker floating around
  in your alcobattered noggin.\r\n\r\n:^)\r\n\r\n;^)\r\n\r\n|^)\r\n\r\nX^)\r\n\r\nX^("

    gusano (the gusano itself, twice) but I think the\r\nmosca was slipped into the
    sambuca \"on site\" by one of your drunk buddies...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
