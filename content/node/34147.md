body: "Hello all,\r\nI'm trying to make a typeface which has GREEK historical references
  for the municipality of my town in Sicily. But it has to be practical as opposed
  to decorative.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any existing fonts that look greek-ish
  yet modern? And that include lowercase chars? I'm just looking for inspiration and
  haven't found anything interesting.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions.\r\n\r\nJ"
