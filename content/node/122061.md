    letter pi for the capital |M|, and enlarge it):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/Refreshment%20Stand/fonts/\r\n\r\nThere
    is a \u201Cfreemium\u201D typeface out there that is also a match, but since it
    post-dates Refreshment Stand by more than a decade, I\u2019m not going to link
    to it here."
