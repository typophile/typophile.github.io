  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,
My name is Tara Kelton. I graduated from Parsons recently and I am having a tough time finding design studios that are hiring. I&rsquo;m very close to taking a job I don&rsquo;t want, and the situation is becoming rather dire. Ideally I&rsquo;d like to work at a small studio where I can learn more about design and be inspired by the people around me. I don&rsquo;t know if this is an impossible dream, I could just be a hopeful young innocent.  I&rsquo;ve dropped my portfolio off at a number of places but all I ever hear is &lsquo;nice work but we&rsquo;re not hiring&rsquo;. So many people have used the adjective &lsquo;nice&rsquo; that I am getting a bit nervous. I think my work is ok but I&rsquo;d really like some honest feedback - <a href="http://tarakelton.com">http://tarakelton.com</a> Each piece can be scrolled through by clicking on the decorative elements I&rsquo;ve positioned under it. (I&rsquo;ve noticed lately that some people miss it.)
Any help would be much appreciated!</div>

mtv meets ikea chic to it. it will sell fake indie pop.</p>
<p>This is not harshly critical, just please try and be mature - realizing that greater designers than you may have &lsquo;missed&rsquo; your navigation interface not because they&rsquo;re dumb or inobservant, but that you may have wandered into the &lsquo;mystery meat&rsquo; realm and are still under the impression that it is somehow chic outside the fine arts to be functionally obscure. I would use this as feedback, roll up my sleeves and get in there and improve it.</p>
<p>The exploitation of labour by yourself to illustrate the imperections in outsourced processes is again, like andrea dworkin making a pornographic picture to illustrate some obscure feminist point about pornography. Instead of using a plotter or printer with clever random seeds, you used live human labour, how innovative. What social conscience. Pharaoh turned down forklifts too. I think it serves as a more poignant critique of expensive, hyped design schools and the socioeconomic status of their student bodies.</p>
<p>Keep trying though. Just cause I&rsquo;m a cranky old sextagenarian shouldn&rsquo;t let me influence you. Perhaps the newfangled way is 
yours. Try and remember that your giant flash downloads, take just enough time on a 56k modem to make my tea&hellip; about twelve minutes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Tara, one way to get noticed is to find out which agencies are currently or will soon be pitching new business. New business pitches are hectic and they usually need a lot of freelance help. Its a great way to get noticed. Trade journals usually list the businesses and agencies that are picked to make new business pitches. Its usually around four agencies.</div>

Your plight is normal for anyone starting out in design. Go to design events hosted by AIGA TDC, ADC.  Just meet people in the field.  You have a better shot at a job if you get an intro from someone. Freelance through an agency (Aquent) to make contacts.  Business is tough.  Your first job won&rsquo;t be a dream job. Put stuff in your portfolio that shows you can be used right away (production savvy work&ndash;tables, charts, layout, etc.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t easy but stick with it.</p>

<p>So am I, I&rsquo;m fresh out of grad school. This may just have to do with my own issues, since I&rsquo;ve been in a similar boat. We all want to find our dream jobs. I was just pointing out the fact that wouldn&rsquo;t it be a bit much if 80 people started threads saying they needed a job&hellip;this site would start being Craig&rsquo;s List after awhile. I&rsquo;m a struggling designer too, that&rsquo;s why it bugs me a little. So, ignore that and please forgive me for commenting about it. That being said&hellip;</p>
<p>So far for me, there are not a lot of places hiring. Tara, you&rsquo;ve been experiencing a lot of what my friends and I are experiencing, &ldquo;were not hiring&rdquo;. In addition, many places seem willing to hire you on as a &ldquo;freelancer&rdquo; where you report to work daily, but get offered no benefits. So you have to pay out the &ldquo;wazoo&rdquo; for your own insurance. I hope this  helps, sorry to get all cosmic on you but– I&rsquo;m a firm believer in karma. Be patient, believe in yourself and your abilities, pound the pavement, make some noise, someone will eventually recognize your skills.</p>
<p>Although, I don&rsquo;t know whether any of that is true or not. I&rsquo;m just hoping that it is. :) Your school&rsquo;s name carries a lot of weight in this town, I&rsquo;d use that to your advantage as well.</p>

<p>i actually took a job searching seminar before i started working for P22 and the thing they kept emphasizing is that networking is the way to find jobs in this day and age. i think whether explicitly or not, by its nature typophile is going to be a networking tool &ndash; it&rsquo;s a place to become acquainted with folks in the type business, put your work up for critique, educate yourself on the craft, &amp;c. I think it&rsquo;s only logical to allow for networking on this site (speaking from my own point of view, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a moderator). i&rsquo;d even like to see an area on the site dedicated soley to networking &ndash; people looking for leads, people posting leads, &amp;c. perhaps something like this would be more appropriate in the uppercase area, however. but i don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with asking for some help here in the general discussion area either.</p>

<p>I think what has happened to the NYC job market is after 9/11 a lot of firms relocated to northern NJ  or LI. Close enough to service their clients but far enough away from the city to keep costs down. Like any trend this will reverse, the only question is when.</p>

Specifically because i&rsquo;m a new member I didn&rsquo;t want it to seem like I was using the board for that and then taking off. I just met some great people at TypeCon and EVERYONE told me to sign up here so I figured that I would give it a shot. Not trying to stir the fire here, just trying to clarify my intentions. I&rsquo;ve been doing an entirely independent search, where as most people in my school use the school&rsquo;s system to find jobs in and around Philly but that just wasn&rsquo;t my cup of tea. Believe me when I say this, I&rsquo;ve been doing a LOT of footwork on my own and research and more looking and more researching. One more place for professional advice just seemed too good to pass up. Much respect for all the professionals and designers here, there was no intention to start what some might find &lsquo;an annoying trend&rsquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello. Do not worry about it. Or try not to. I graduated from the top school here in the UK last year, and have been on and off freelance for a year (which has been great and at times awful) and have just got offered jobs at three of the top studios. This is down to working my ass off and networking like no other. I&rsquo;m not sure if it works the same over there, but even if you can get to see the designer of your choice for a 30 minute chat, they can perhaps give you some advice – or with any luck give you contact details – other designers they may know personally – therein you could name drop. Be ruthless (but not rude). Don&rsquo;t give up. If you really want to do it and want to succeed you will not give up. It all sounds a bit cliché, but it&rsquo;s true.</div>
