  iKern (the search function seems disabled at the moment, otherwise I'd cite it,
  sorry!)\r\n\r\nHas anyone here used his software, or know where i can download it,
  or what happened to its development?  More to the point, I suppose: does anyone
  know what happened to <em>him</em>? - emails to him bounce back.  \r\n\r\nAlso what
  do you think of his revival fonts, such as his Fells English?  (I'd put up a jpeg
  or something but the site won't allow me.  I've had the same problem a number of
  times.)  \r\n\r\nCheers to all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
