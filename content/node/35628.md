body: "This is a logo design for a speech/writing contest at a university. The contest
  is for undergrads. The idea is to put a youthful/energetic face on a concept that
  might seem boring. The target media is print and the smallest size will be letterhead.\r\n\r\nThe
  client liked this font. \r\n\r\nI don't care if you think this looks like mindless
  trash from a 1990's clipart collection. :) I just want to know how the kerning looks
  on the main \"voices\" text.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/voices2-first_4988.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to get better at manual kerning...\r\n\r\nThanks."

    but the customer knows what he wants.

  body: "Open up either side of the \u2018I\u2019, try flipping the V* and closing
    that slightly.\r\nbtw. I think you really need to work on the strapline, positioning,
    typeface(s), alignment.\r\n\r\n* the drop shadow looks inconsistent with the other
    characters, the \u2018I\u2019 could do with more consistent shadows too\r\n\r\nTim"

    think it is too busy. Try removing some lines in motion. If that is the option
    the Client liked - roll with it.\r\n\r\nGabe"
