  do you find particularly aesthetic? what is your typographic identity?\r\n\r\nsome
  of my obsessions : \r\n\r\nITC RONDA\r\nBODEGA SANS (mcdonalds uses this)\r\nBINARY
  (by mauricio reyes, used in sydney olympics!)\r\nROTIS SEMI SERIF\r\nMYRIAD CONDENSED\r\ntypefaces
  designed by M/M\r\nTORONTO SUBWAY\r\nDIN\r\nGILL SANS\r\nAPPLE GARAMOND\r\nFUTURA\r\nOPTIMA\r\nVAG
  ROUNDED (innit the font that macs have on their keyboards?)\r\nTRAJAN\r\nSERPENTINE\r\n...\r\n\r\noverall
  i like fonts that have a systemic structure that combines both geometric / symmetric
  / prime and chaotic / asymmetric elements but look very proportionally balanced
  and geometrically, proportionally hierarchical.. so every chaotic looking element
  / ornament functions effectively in terms of geometry and proportion as a whole..
  an abstract at once orderly superstructure! im still figuring out the means to pursue
  it further.. but i was wondering which typefaces do you like? and which particular
  elements keep you hooked?\r\n\r\nhave a nice day\r\nhun"
