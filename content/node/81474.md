body: "Hi All,\r\nLong time listener, first time caller here. I am struggling choosing
  typefaces for a coffee table book that I am redesigning. The book is about Indian
  Motorcycles, the first American Motorcycle brand. The majority of the \"story\"
  or information takes place in 1900-1960 America.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm trying to
  put together a typographic palette that has a somewhat mechanical/industrial feel
  that suites the general Americana theme but that has a bit more contemporary flavor.
  Originally I was toying around with the idea of Franklin/News Gothic or perhaps
  Rockwell for titling and something along the lines of Benton Sans for body.\r\n\r\nWhere
  I'm really struggling is coming up with a pairing (titling/body) that is not overly
  expected or stale. Any suggestions or ideas are welcome, I'd really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\nZack"

  body: Trade Gothic, especially bold condensed, is beautiful for titling.  Maybe
    a slab serif like Eames or Sentinel would be nice for the body.

  body: "Metro as sans, Excelsior for text.\r\n\r\nThose are authentic faces from
    the era, but lesser used than the ones you mentioned.\r\n\r\nFor a present day
    interpretation, consider my Brown (sans) with Eames (serif) \u2014 these styles
    have a subtle finish informed by the letterpress media of that time.\r\n\r\nFor
    a newer look in a retro vein, Brandon Grotesque (sans) is gorgeous, but in a modernist
    layout with just the one face, otherwise the small x-height may be too quaint.\r\n\r\nSkilt?"

  body: "Thank you both for your responses and suggestions. \r\n\r\nNick, the idea
    of Brown and Eames is quite interesting as is Brandon Grotesque. I will investigate
    those all further.\r\n\r\nTrevor, I had the same idea earlier w/ Trade but eventually
    decided against it because it is so commonly used, sentinel was one I had not
    considered though, so thank you.\r\n\r\nWould something along the lines of Bureau
    Grotesque or Knockout be relevant to this application, perhaps paired with one
    of the aforementioned slabs for body\u2014Eames or Sentinel?\r\n\r\nThanks again
    for the feedback. Much appreciated."
