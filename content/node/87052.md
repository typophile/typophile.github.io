body: "I have a quite odd assignment from a magazine: to find 25 different, single
  characters worth showcasing for the sake of their beauty (or for the sake of their
  interesting form, at least). \r\n\r\nThis seemed like a nice, interesting assignment,
  but I've realized that unless I rely on my old typespecimens only, it will be hard
  to find 25 characters worth showing. \r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nGoing through character
  sets on the web is a very time consuming business.\r\n\r\nI have a few own favourites
  (like the Bembo f), but are eager to hear: do you have a favourite character from
  any typeface I should showcase?\r\n\r\nHappy to hear any suggestions! "

  body: The machine constraints in Sabon's italic f. The printing constraints in Bell
    Centennial. The hinted outline in a range of sizes (binary to greyscale, to cleartype
    to directwrite) of Georgia's g. The wrapping of curves in W A Dwiggins' many experiments.
    Evert Bloemsma's letters in general. The traits of left handed writing in some
    of Jim Rimmer's faces. Perhaps you could also make a historic timeline of the
    evoulution of the 'a'. The uppercase eszett. Sounds very much like you haven't
    fallen in love with type yet.

  body: "It's quite a few years since I spent this much time going through the distributors'
    online type catalogues. It strikes me how bad most of them works, in different
    ways. For instance, in at least some of the Linotype pdf specimens, the only uppercase
    letters you can see is H and O. \r\nGenerally, for many typefaces there are no
    pdf specimens at all. When there are any, they are often not very good. The screen
    representations of the fonts are in some cases really bad, so that when you use
    the test drive, the result is so bad that you'll probably consider some other
    font. \r\nAnd so on.   \r\n\r\nWorking a lot with web, usability, ux and such
    myself, I find this quite amazing."

  body: "Hi Per, \r\nin case you ever need to do this again \u2013 I run this letter
    blog Jackson mentioned and although the typefaces are from and link to different
    foundries, I used private tags on MyFonts.com for collecting, cataloging and \u2013
    most importantly \u2013 finding them back. (I have plenty of awesome glyphs surplus,
    in case you need more :) \r\nUsually I typed the characters I was looking for
    into the custom setting field, but MyFonts has a pretty good glyph overview as
    well. The maximum size you can view the letters and quality of images is really
    good too. Though I always wondered, whether it is allowed according to the fonts\u2019
    EULAs to grab those images. (Ugh, opening a can of worms here I guess.)\r\n\r\nThis,
    by the way, explains the idea behind the collection: http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/iabc/"
