  soon be bestowed upon many of our favorite (or least favorite) motion pictures.

  either:\r\n\r\nA) Set the word \"BLOCKBUSTER\" or any other movie-related word.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nB)
  Design a movie poster using your swash characters in the movie title.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinner

    the combination between Bickham Script and Trajan Pro, just so you know.\r\n\r\nAnd
    for the record, Helvetica movie using Trajan? Hmm, interesting.\r\n\r\n--- pinky

  body: "To clarify, whenever a battle calls for the creation of an element relating
    to type design, it means one should *create* an original drawing.\r\n\r\nIf this
    isn't possible, you can go ahead and take existing elements from the typeface
    of your choice, frankenstein the shapes and submit them as your creation, but
    at this point in time you must be aware the community then has every right to
    call you on it and potentially ruin your reputation in the forums \u2026 forever!
    Muuhahahahaa :P\r\n\r\nSeriously - try to draw your own."
