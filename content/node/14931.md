  (non-pixel-font) is like 10 px there are always ugly smoothing edges.\r\n\r\nhow
  do i achieve these very fine text smoothing like in http://www.filemaker.com/ (manage
  people etc. top left). in photoshop this just looks ugly.\r\n\r\nwhat is the way
  to make very fine and accurate smoothing when text size is only like 10 px? thanks."

      out of every font? so ultrafonts are not new fonts but just altered fonts which
      have nicer smoothing?'

    render out hand-crafted anti-aliased forms (although only at one give PPEM size).
    This level of quality cannot be -or at least has not yet been- automated. Also,
    you can't \"convert\" from some other format to an ultrafont - at least not without
    spending gobs of time cleaning up - time better spent making one from scratch
    (like my stuff is).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
