body: I am trying to assist my mother-in-law with obtaining/recreating a logo for
  their family business that was created by her father and been around for many years.  None
  of the employees seems to have a soft copy of their logo and I was hoping to recreate
  something very similar in Adobe/Illustrator.  Does anyone have any idea what fonts
  are utilized?  I am especially interested in trying to figure out the script font
  used in "Eddie's", but would love to know the font used in "Tire" as well.  I would
  be grateful for any feedback that any of the forum members might have.  I really
  would like to help her out.  Thank you for your time and knowledge.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_4374.JPG]

    Ultra Black is close for the TIRE, as is Antique Olive, then you have to round
    the corners of the E by converting it to paths.
