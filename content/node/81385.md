  close [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/rolling-ball-cursive|Rolling Ball
  Cursive]]. The real difference I have found so far is that the capital \"A\" is
  not right at all. (I have found every font that is close has that same problem.)\r\n\r\nAny
  help is much appreciated. :)\r\n\r\n"
