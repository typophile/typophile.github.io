  off for ages and feel I'd benefit from an impartial critique of the current favourite.
  I'm not too sure about the kerning and the alterations I have made to the letters
  and would like to hear what you think.\r\n\r\nA little background about our company
  and who the target 'market' would be. We are an interactive agency specialising
  in high-end flash websites and online production. Our current clients are mostly
  television/film production companies, photographers and various advertising agencies.\r\n\r\nThe
  aesthetic I was going for with the logo is modern and clean while retaining a sense
  of playfulness. I also want the logo to feel a little retro without being too derivative..
  \r\n\r\nAny comments greatly appreciated, this is not really my forte and has been
  a lot harder than I imagined! \r\n\r\np.s. The bird is a 'Gladeye' and would be
  used both in conjunction with the name and on its own.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_for_typo_6183.gif]"

    on where it is used. "

    the 'e-y-e'. I feels they will join together, especially at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nJay"

  body: "Love the version with the bird sitting on the lettering! Exploring various
    modes of conjunction may be a good idea, though; in small applications like business
    cards, the bird will likely suffer when it is this small, especially seeing that
    it has a much higher level of detail than the lettering already.\r\n\r\nCome to
    think of it, this offers a great wealth of possibilities. Why not make the bird
    a brand character, like a mascot? Depending on media / context, he could even
    be animated, sit on the logo in different ways, flap his wings, maybe pick away
    at the counters or attack the mouse cursor from time to time \u2026 especially
    seeing that you do interactive and probably animated work, that may be a befitting
    (and fun) expansion of the 'logo' idea. (Reminds me a bit of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.de/typo2006/\">what
    the TYPO Berlin conference in 2006 did with the cat</a> \u2013 they had a black
    Flash cat as a mascot, who 'lived' on the website. She'd often sit still for a
    while, but had a number of (sometimes surprising, playful and funny) behaviours
    that were randomly played; a whole bunch of people came back to the website just
    to see 'what the cat was doing', and she became the secret star of the conference)."

    the word together.\r\n\r\naltaira: Thank you for your ideas, the TYPO Berlin website
    and their use of the cat mascot is really cool. I was in Berlin at the same time
    as that conference but wasn't aware of it, shame! I like the idea of the bird
    as a brand character that we can use independently and we are in the process of
    redesigning our website so an animated character works well with our new ideas.

    between the letters e-y-e and am feeling a little stumped. \r\n\r\nThis is the
    best I have come up with so far. I took the approach of following the line of
    the first e through to connect with the center of the second e.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
    regarding this approach? Anyone think of a more natural connection between such
    difficult letters?\r\n\r\nGerald: I had a try at enlarging the g in response to
    your comment but felt it started to get a little out of proportion. In the end
    I have kept it the same size as the earlier post.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_test_3622.gif]"

  body: The terminals may be another thing to look at that may contribute to the present
    disjunction of "glad" and "eye". Have you tried making them rounded in the e/y
    as well?

  body: I don't like the connection of the eye nor do I like the top eye. I think
    that the top one needs some more space between the e-y--e. I might try using small
    caps on the eye? Not sure if I would like that or not either. I am diggin the
    overall feel of it and the beginning letters. I think your first version is more
    successful than the second ones that are connected by far. I think the reason
    the eye is so different because of the tops of the y are not near as round as
    the rest of the characters. Try tweaking those a bit and see if that leads you
    anywhere.

    try both. I have really struggled to join those last 3 letters without distorting
    the first e and I was not happy with the latest version I posted. \r\n\r\nWe have
    moved into a new office today and need to get the signage sorted so I appreciate
    the help in fine tuning our logo. Will post some new versions soon.\r\n\r\n"

    approaches to the connections. \r\n\r\nI did have several attempts at the connection
    you suggested Robert but felt the e-y-e ended up a little too tightly kerned in
    relation to the rest of the letters. I agree that it does seem the most natural
    connection but I worry that at smaller sizes the last three letters will run together.
    I think the e-y works better than the y-e as it makes the top right side of the
    y rather heavy.. I will have another crack at it this afternoon and see how I
    feel about it. \r\n\r\nGerald, I don't mind the connection of the tail of the
    y to the e, I haven't tried that so will give it a go. The second suggestion I
    did try and was not happy with the way the last e sat on the end of the word and
    also the top right side of the y ends up rather heavy.\r\n\r\n"

    its stroke weights to make them visually equivalent to others.\r\n\r\ny-e combination
    would probably benefit from moving e a bit further to the right but not too much
    to make it look distracting. Just a bit to make the connection visible and better.\r\n\r\nPlay
    a bit.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
