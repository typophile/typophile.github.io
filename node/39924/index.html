<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I'm in a bit of a quandary, and could do with some advice.
I'm doing various leaflet / flyer marketing pieces.
The company's logo uses Eurostile, and have used Eurostile in various things like signage in the past.
So I was thinking to keep continuity, of using Eurostile for headings etc, and mixing it with another font for the body text.
I'm In a number of minds over what font to contrast with Eurostile, sans, or serif. maybe a 'super family' with both?
I've looked at fonts like Melior, and ITC Fenice, which have similarities with Eurostile, but them seem a bit sharp and mean.
I suppose the feel should represent quality and sincerity, friendly and inviting.
Or should I scrap the idea of using the font in their identity,
and just choose one font with a good range of weights, and use that throughout, for titles and body text etc. ?
Any ones suggestions of what direction they think would be good to go would be very much appreciated.

<div class=commentbody>I like Melior and I think it's a great text companion for Eurostile; I probably would have thought to suggest it even if you hadn't mentioned it. I definitely find it a friendly and inviting face myself... but as mentioned I like it so I'm probably not being impartial.
Not so fond of Fenice as a text face, but a lot has to do with the letterspacing, leading and size. I bet a good designer could set with it and I'd go, “Hmmm, that's nice!” when I looked at the page (probably by using wider spacing than I'm generally fond of). I have the same reservations about Bodoni but I've seen it and liked it for text without consciously paying attention to how it was set.
I would prefer not to pair Eurostile headings with a sans text face given the choice, but I've seen it used with Helvetica in the past and it didn't suck - the very blandness of Helvetica means it doesn't fight with Eurostile's characteristics. So how about Neue Helvetica 45? Might be worth giving Optima a shot too, you might like them together.

<div class=commentbody>I think it's a good idea to keep their identity going - see if you can work the Eurostile into the materials. Altho I don't think of Eurostile as particularly "friendly and inviting". I think your instinct to mix it with a serif font is a good one, both because they're less likely to fight and because serifs are a little more friendly.
Something else by Novarese (you mentioned Fenice) is a good way to start. Maybe look at the font Novarese? Altho both it and Fenice lack italics. Belizio?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for your replies.
Yeah, I don't think eurostile is particularly friendly either, I wouldn't have used it had i not inherited it.
But hopefully i can work it in and still get a good result.
I keep coming back to melior, because it does work nicely with eurostile, but I just feel it maybe looks a bit rigid?
I quite like belizio, that seems more friendly. Does that seem a fair assessment?

<div class=commentbody>I don't know, I think Eurostile is quite friendly looking compared within its own genre. It has a softness and refinement that I find lacking in some more recent square-sided sans faces.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you should keep the identity, and try to do not mix typographies. However if you "have to" use any other typography I would suggest a serif, at leas to look for an excuse/change... But still thinking that 1 typography in a artwork is more than enough. Keep it simple... as Bruno Munary would say: "design is simplifying no complicating". But is just a personal agreement.
