body: "Hello!\r\nToday my fonts Newt Serif and Solveig (previously only on Veer) are
  now available on MyFonts. I'm excited to have them out now on the biggest font repository
  around, for everyone to see. I hope they do well in their new environment. To celebrate
  the move (and, no secret, to try to kick-start them onto the bestseller list), I'm
  holding an <strong>87\xBD percent off sale</strong> (they're 1/8 the price). That
  puts these fonts squarely in the reach of casual font enthusiasts who can't afford
  to buy a font at design-firm-geared prices just to use for their own purposes. If
  that describes you \u2014 or, in fact, even if it doesn't \u2014 hurry over to MyFonts
  for these two fonts. Thanks, and I hope you like them!\r\n\r\n<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/looseleaf-fonts/solveig/>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SolveigFlag_5244.PNG]\r\nSolveig</a>\r\n\r\n<a
