body: I need to display some screenshots (72ppi) in a document. When I exported, the
  pdf displays the images blurry, even though I view the document at 100% size. Any
  ideas on how I can solve this issue?

  body: I'm  working in InDesign. I have tried setting image downsampling to 72 ppi
    when exporting, as well choosing "Do not downsample". Neither worked.

  body: I did and it didn't help. The pictures are of different fonts rendered in
    various browsers. The clarity is the whole point of it.

  body: Wierd! Viewing the document at 73% size renders the type perfectly.

  body: So the precentage in Acrobat Reader (or any other pdf viewer) aren't true?
    100% isn't 100% in terms of pixels.

    of 93 pixel per inch won\u2019t look the same as 100% at a customized resolution
    of 72ppi. You might assume that most people (on a Mac, using this very piece of
    software, that is) haven\u2019t changed the default and thus specify an initial
    zoom factor of ~77,419% in your document \u2013 but that neither looks good nor
    will solve your problem.\r\nBetter include links to online images.\r\nF"

    idea: upsample your screenshots in PhotoShop to 4 times 73% using the bilinear
    setting and place these in your layout with a 25% reduction. Don\u2019t use downsampling
    when PDF-ing.\r\nCould be the way to go\u2026\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

    as well.
