body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI am currently working on a logo design for a company that delivers
  high quality services for the petrol industry. They needed a logo with a modern
  feeling, making them feel established and safe to work with (as they are dealing
  with big numbers, that was a priority). The client wanted something with a helvetica-ish
  feeling, making them look professional and that they are operating worldwide.\r\n\r\nHere
  are some of the final concepts I am working on, I would be delighted to have your
  opinion on it :)\r\n\r\n "
