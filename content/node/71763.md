    alphabet showings never contain this glyph. As far as I know, it is just two capitals
    letters, very tightly spaced, sometimes even touching. Hence, something like your
    #4 for a cursive style, or #5 in a \u2018blockier\u2019 style.\r\n\r\nFlorian"

    french book and even a french friend of mine couldn#t tell me the right answer.
    Weird.\r\n\r\nThank you."
