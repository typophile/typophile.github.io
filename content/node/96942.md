body: "Hi guys! Hope you can help me with this one. It comes from the logo of a client,
  and they don't have the original (doh!). Here's the link to their site http://bit.ly/T5rNYQ
  and I also attach here a contrasted version of each glyph in black.\r\n\r\nI know
  it's a small sample of glyphs, but there are distinctive features such as the E
  and the B, and also the N. I tried identifont, whatthefont and other services, and
  all I get ftom WTF is a distant approximation (it being Aura oblique) and the other
  services with questionnaires don't cover this particular kind of B, which I'm sure
  will be very helpful to identify.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance just for reading
  this! =)"
