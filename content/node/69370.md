    by Rosemary Sassoon; the first volume is pretty good as well.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/sassoon_infant_by_monotype_std_value_pack/?&sample_text=Larn%20yerself&update=0|Sassoon

    I was at university with making enquiries similar to yours and receiving a very
    good reply."

  body: "I\u2019m not sure wether \u2018semi-literate\u2019 is to be seen the same
    as learning readers. For the latter, fonts with so-called infant letterforms are
    widely used \u2013 and much debated. Search Typophile for \u201Cinfant letterforms\u201D.\r\nOr
    have a look at [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=304|one
    of the children\u2019s typefaces]]."

    these circumstances, called [[http://www.linotype.com/13725/helveticatextbookroman-font.html|
    Helvetica Textbook]].

  body: "I think Mr B. Chav is looking for research, not font suggestions. If the
    research exists it likely compared preference and perhaps performance amongst
    the target group (semi-literate adults?) across a range of typefaces. I can\u2019t
    imagine type size would have specific impact for this target group, except I\u2019d
    guess they are more likely to have uncorrected or incorrectly corrected vision
    due to poverty/malnutrition? If the target audience isn\u2019t small children
    I\u2019d also be concerned about using clich\xE9 kid\u2019s typefaces."

  body: "@sii absolutely right you are.\r\n\r\nI posted in a bit of a hurry and did
    not properly express the idea I had in mind.\r\n\r\nA careful comparison of Helvetica
    and Helvetica Textbook will yield interesting observations about what legibility/readability
    challenges were encountered and what steps were taken to meet them by another
    type designer confronted with a similar situation.\r\n\r\nInsofar as research
    is concerned, Herbert Spencer's <em>Visible Word</em>, an ample compendium of
    legibility research with a killer bibliography, might be a useful source from
    which to glean the required information."
