  their website it looks a little blurred around some edges and is not totally crisp.\r\n\r\nI
  assumed I could just get the vector version of the original logo and re-save it
  but I noticed even in Adobe Illustrator it still looks slightly blurred around some
  edges - until i magnified it 12 times. Some of the angles are just so fine that
  it seems they don't come out so well on screen.\r\n\r\nSo my question is this -
  is this font not ideal for screen display and if so can anyone recommend a very
  similar alternative that is good for screens?"
