    Duffy Script.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The other complications: I think perhaps some stroke thickness has been added,
    and perhaps some rotation of the G, but I do think this is Duffy Script.\r\n\r\n[edit:
    The description of the font says it was designed with four versions of every letter,
    and OpenType would randomize them to make the result look more handwritten.]\r\n\r\n-

    It would have been interesting if Nick was around to offer his opinion, since
    it's his font. Since I don't own the font, I have no way to play with it.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I'll try to stir him up to see if he wants to weigh in on this one, but do you
    agree now that most of this seems to be Duffy Script?\r\n\r\n[edit: I've sent
    an e-mail to Nick, to see if he would like to participate in this thread]\r\n\r\n-

    for one thing, and as Jan demonstrates, this is a weight between Duffy's Demi
    and Bold."

  body: "It's their prerogative, and quite legitimate.\r\nFor just a few letters in
    a logo, they may have thought it unnecessary to purchase the font, and they could
    do a screen grab at my site, or one of my distributors, of the letters they needed,
    and use that as the basis for making their own custom version of the wordmark.
    \r\n\r\nOr perhaps they considered that the font was almost right for the job,
    but too slick and the wrong weight.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the re-working provides
    a custom logo that cannot be exactly duplicated by anybody else using the font.\r\n\r\nI
    just googled \"Glitch\", and came up with this:\r\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/feb/10/glitch-game-butterfield\r\n\r\nI
    don't hate that, I love it!\r\nI wonder how Amanda feels?\r\n\r\nSo perhaps the
    main reason is that the letters needed to be re-drawn for the illustration anyway,
    because it would be just too stilted for the illustrator to duplicate the font
    shapes (which are in essence a hardened-up version of hand lettering), especially
    considering the perspective dimensionality required."
