    an ancient heritage in Chinese and Islamic architecture. Bricks of different colors
    or in relief would form the outline of square-shaped letters in a frieze. Here
    is a an example\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/youngrobv/884594610/\r\nThis style
    later evolved into an Arabic lettering - and now font - style called square kufic.
    \r\nSorry sii if this is not exactly the intended direction for this thread!"

  body: "I strongly doubt the name \"Sand Saref\" is a coincidence. Punny names are
    not uncommon in The Spirit comics.\r\n\r\nThe poster with the buildings turned
    into letters is very much in keeping with the graphic style of The Spirit. Eisner
    often worked the title of the strip graphically into the opening \"splash panel\"
    of his comics like that. The poster may even be based on one of them."

    City flick with Robert Rodriguez! That first poster is way cool... The second
    poster is very hot, but doesn't really look like it's part of the same series...  :-)

    on Sand Saref</a>, the character (comic book character, that is).\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    the site  mentions that \"Eisner patterned many of his women on movie stars of
    his day. (...) Silk Satin was Katharine Hepburn; Sand Saref was Lauren Bacall...\"\r\n\r\nTry
    to live up to <strong>that</strong>, Eva Mendes!"

    approach was brilliant and influential on almost anything interesting or good
    being done today in comics.\r\n\r\nIt seems there should be a huge crossover between
    fans of type and fans of comics/graphic novels... of all the art forms, comics
    takes its lettering most seriously. (Daniel Clowes & Chris Ware are not my faves
    - but, oh, they can letter!  So can Crumb.  Damn.)\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

    <a href=\"http://www.stoutbooks.com/cgi-bin/stoutbooks.cgi/69003.html\"><em>Handwritten</em></a>
    to him, with an introduction that displayed many examples of Crumb's lettering
    over the years. (I don't have a copy of the book now, but I once borrowed it from
    the Brooklyn Public Library.)\r\n\r\n[EDIT] And yeah, I agree -- those guys (Ware,
    Crumb, and others) are damn good when it comes to lettering, titling, etc."
