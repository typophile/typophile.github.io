  with all of these Central European characters such as a ogonek, e ogonek and so
  on? I use Fontographer 4.5, I drew all the glyphs, but when it comes to generating
  a font - I am helpless. My font works perfectly on screen, but when I tried to use
  it in InDesign and print something, it just didn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR>I am really
  desperate, so I would appreciate any kind of help. many thanks in advance.'

  body: 'Fontographer is not the best tool to create CE fonts. I am afraid you&#39;ll
    have to do fonts in FontLab. The only way to create working Type 1 fonts with
    CE characters in Fontographer is to name all glyphs correctly: a ogonek as &#34;aogonek&#34;,
    C caron as &#34;Ccaron&#34; etc. You have to rename all glyphs manualy. Also the
    order of glyphs is important, it should follow the order in CE encoding for Mac
    &#40;Mac CE&#41; or PC &#40;CP 1250&#41;.'
