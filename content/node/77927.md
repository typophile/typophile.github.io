  body: The body type looks like Baskerville to me.

  body: "No, it's not Baskerville. It's some kind of a Didone face: note the unbracketed
    serifs, and the tall, angled stem of the t, and the curvy leg of the R.\r\n\r\nThe
    capitals are quite wide, while the lower-case is relatively narrow. It looks like
    a cross between a Bodoni (C with two spurs, R, t) and a Century (splayed serifs
    at the top of T, J and K [not shown in this sample], y)."

  body: "You're right Greenpig, I glanced at it too quickly!\r\n\r\nThe title I believe
    is set in either [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/janson-text/56-italic-oldstyle-figures/|Janson
    56 Italic]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/archetype/italic/|Archetype Italic]]
    or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bell-mt/italic/|Bell MT Italic]].\r\n\r\nI'll
    get back to you on that tricky body text.\r\n\r\n"

    to a catalogue; the quality is not that good so I may be mistaken... '

  body: Thanks, Atwe. That's a font I've never heard of, but I think you're right.
    The cut is slightly different -- the capitals in the catalog aren't the extra-wide
    ones in the book text -- but the general letterforms are right on. Thanks for
    digging up this obscure face. I'll have to do some research on it.

    Rookledge. Undigitized, alas.
