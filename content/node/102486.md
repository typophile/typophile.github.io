  list events based on local music venues?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something sans condensed
  for headings that relates to venue signage plus something for event details that'll
  hold up at small copy size. Open to any suggestions though."

  body: "Music is such a broad topic. Are you talking about Open Air rock concerts
    or small neighborhood Jazz clubs? Arias in operas or chamber concerts in old church
    attics? Punk, trash, industrial or alternative Rock? Electronica? I haven't even
    touched the surface of the iceberg here. All these different music styles involve
    all kinds of typographic interpretations.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the new (current)
    David Bowie album, <em>The Next Day</em>. Would you characterize a dry sans serif
    as typical for his rock?\r\n\r\nDesign using typefaces is really what you make
    of it, rather than a specific font associated with a broad type of expression
    like <em>music</em>. In other words: every font can work, if you make it work."

  body: "Totally agree on your take, and nevertheless... I'm still asking the question.\r\n\r\nI
    am not looking for a typeface that says \"Music!\" as I agree that's not possible.
    I mentioned the app theme only for context. If anything.. I am thinking something
    that might reference the vernacular of america theater and concert hall marquees.
    The app with be featuring only american venues and at that on a city by city basis.\r\n\r\nIf
    I had to answer my own request in generic terms.. I would say I am looking for
    a condensed sans or possibly slab and a complementary text face suitable for information
    copy in small text sizes.\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps define my request a bit
    more. Are there any specific typeface suggestions that would satisfy the generic
    terms I outline above?"

    Something along the likes of....\r\n\r\nSeeking good pairing of a condensed gothic
    sans for headings and second face for small type body copy. To be used in iOS
    app. Ideal would reference an American vernacular.  \r\n"

    You Shall Know Them\u2026 \r\nWrite code to choose the font based on the number
    of letters in the band name.\r\n(Great idea for an OpenType font!)\r\nWhy not
    do the whole thing all caps, like the gig listings in an entertainment paper."

  body: Shamelesserly, ideal references to several American vernaculars, depending
    on the time period requested, for iOS apps, coming in recommended size masters,
    for text and UI, sizes at which type cannot get too vernacular, and heads, where
    anything goes, are available for trial and distribution and may be found via webtype.com,
    e.g. Other American and musical vernacular types are available for iOS from Typekit,
    Fontshop, Monotype & many others followed by .com, I'm pretty sure.

  body: "I think if you want to use a kind of generic \u201Cold poster\u201D font,
    you could look at the Knockout series. These kinds of fonts were often used with
    Open Air concerts in the past.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100013\r\n\r\nThese
    will likely not fit with Electronica, but anything from classic rock to blues
    and jazz works quite well with this font. And there is a huge variety of cuts
    and widths available."

  body: "thank you all for the suggestions thus far.\r\n\r\nI really like H&FJ's Tungsten
    for heads (the condensed could be useful to prevent long names from wrapping)
    and was thinking it would pari reasonably well with Gotham.\r\n\r\nThen I looked
    at their license terms and seemingly they do not offer licenses for embedding
    fonts in mobile apps as of now. I sent an email asking about this but have received
    no response.\r\n\r\nAnyone know of a comparable (or near comparable) pairing to
    Tungsten and Gotham that WOULD be available to embed in an iOS app?\r\n\r\n"
