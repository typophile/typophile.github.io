This question is perhaps more intended for designers and typographers than type designers, but do you miss on the market some typeface you could imagine, for your needs or just for esthetic sake, e. g. sans with XY attributes or a more contemporary Caslon or some never digitized typeface etc etc?</div>

Well it differs from language to language, but nowhere near as complex as the languages of the Far East.

For the Devangari script which is the basis of most northern Indian languages, and therefore the most widely used, it should be around under 90 characters including numerals accents, ligatures etc. But I must admit I'm no expert on Devanagari.

In the 70s and 80s many Indian languages, including the one I speak, went through script reforms mainly to rationalize the number of characters and make them viable on typewriters. With recent advances in language technology, there are moves to return to earlier schemes which had far more characters (and I must add character:). </div>

Great!

"I was informed today that a good font for Devanagari literary texts could have 800 characters, 300 is more of a working mininum"

Most of those would be ligatures, or rather, compound characters. I know that's the case with Malayalam, a Dravidian language spoken in south of the country. We had about 900 characters which in the reformed script was brought down to less than a hundred largely by doing away with the need for compound characters. 

I can read and write Sankrit and Hindi - both Languages that use Devanagari - tolerably well. I really don't think there are 800, or for that matter 300 unique characters in use today. 

But like I said I'm not an expert on Devanagari, or a typeface designer. If you've been talking to somebody at Reading, you could be right.

		<div class="commentbody">I would like someone to produce a competent digital version of Electra, Granjon and Aldus. One that is thick, juicy and useable, not thin, wispy and hopelessly weak. I also love Galliard Roman, but despise the italic--it's just not legible if used for anything other than spot text and captions. A "Galliard Book Pro" for example, this is something I'd be very interested in.</div>

I have a very good book here, very interesting, entirely composed in Galliard, and EVERY time italics appear in the book, I feel funny. These two sets of types just don't fit with each other, for me. And that's a shame, for I truely love the romans.

		<div class="commentbody">For years, starting about 1988 I pestered people toward getting a good digital version of Linotype Monticello. & For most of those years I was laughed at and told no one would buy it. Or I was met with uncomprehending stares from the many people who had never heard of it.

Thanks to Princeton University Press and its Thomas Jefferson papers project, we now have a very nice Monticello, created by Matthew Carter.

Over the past ten years or so, though, I have become much less interested in "revivals" of older faces. As James Puckett suggests above, rather let us encourage typeface designers to start anew, to create types go beyond "revivals." In book types [at least for setting English] it may be argued that it will be tough to do anything wholly "new." Basic forms are set, and both readers and typographers have expectations from text types. But recent work from folks such as Kent Lew and Stefan Hattenbach shows that standard forms can be subtly adjusted and re-worked to make new types that both meet those expectations and present us with intelligent variations on the model.

I for one do not care how closely any revival of, say, a Garamond model or a Caslon model hews to any particular earlier Garamond or Caslon. This is a fruitless quest. & any resulting face will be the subject of many gaseous arguments about how close it is to the "true" model. Why should anyone care about that? What I want is a face of robust color for offset printing, and one that makes full use of the technologies for both creating and using the new fonts.

That said, as soon as someone comes up with a really good version of Electra, I shall want it. Electra fills a unique typographic niche. Nothing since has come close, and all digital versions are purely watered down; I shall not use them. But there are times when I have wished for it.

		<div class="commentbody">Aside from revivals - today when there are so many text typefaces available, does it happen that you need a font for a project but you go for a compromise because nothing on the market exactly matches what you imagine as the most suitable? Do graphic designers and typographers ever imagine non-existing fonts? I guess yes as this is one of the reasons why typefaces are commissioned. My question is if you ever think of something quite specific that is not a revival.

(Years ago I had a very specific image of a sans typeface in my mind. Then Joshua Darden's Freight Sans was released - and it's a 90% match of what I had imagined. Now, someone will tease me to death because of another thread on lowercase a, but I imagined the “a” a little different, maybe less inclined to the left, but that's really not important and I'm happy it's out.)

I agree that seeking the holy grail of 'authenticity' is misguided. In the case of Caslon, this was attempted by the late Justin Howe, but the metal type he used included 19th century recuttings of Caslon, as well as some damaged old type. He also digitized his face based on his modern prints from the metal types, and the result is much lighter than 18th century or even most later letter press printing of Caslon. The result in my view is good for an 'antique' look, but not so good for general use. 

My fantasy for Electra is that Monotype Imaging will commission Kent Lew to do a good version. </div>

All I can say in my defense is to quote Walt Whitman:
