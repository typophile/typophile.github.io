body: "Hi, here's a experiment series i made in blackletter, first the are two styles
  Africana and Europea, the difference between them is the position of a 90\xBA angle.
  There is also small caps based upon some attemps in the letterings i see in the
  streets ( i'm from Mexico, and we use lots of blackletter for anything)ended looking
  like lettering of heavy metal logos.\r\n\r\nThere's a more detailed preview in behance,
  but the version attached here is more updated\r\nhttp://www.behance.net/Gallery/Golondrina-Africana-_amp-Europea/427447"

  body: "I don't think I've ever seen such a static blackletter.\r\nThough it grows
    on me, the more I look at it.\r\n\r\nMy main complaint would be the non-letter
    glyphs. No calligraphic origin remains, those characters look (%, & etc.) like
    they were laid down with electrical tape, not a pen."

  body: Maybe it's just me, but it feels like it's falling backwards (leaning to the
    left), even though that's just an optical illusion.

  body: "Interesting experiment!\r\nThough some glyphs would need to get revised,
    e.g. monetary signs."
