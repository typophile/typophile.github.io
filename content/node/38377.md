  a custom. I don't know. I'm fascinated that he doesn't have access to his original
  logo or anything bigger than this image from his website.\r\n\r\nAny help with identifying
  the font - or something close to it - would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/modlife_5642.jpg]"

  body: This one is very poorly designed, so I suppose it's some free- or shareware
    font.

  body: Sorry for not being clear, but what I meant is that there are a gazillion
    free- and shareware fonts out there, so finding this baby might prove to be a
    tad harder than usual.
