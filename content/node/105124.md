body: "I want to start expanding some of my fonts to include full diacritics, thorn,
  eth, Cyrillic, and possibly Greek.\r\n\r\nSince I have never done this before, I
  am unsure how to create a blank Fontlab file which I will use for a template.  When
  I create a new (blank) file in Fontlab, I can't seem to find the option for ALL
  these options in one file.  I can get latin and cyrillic, but no greek, or I can
  get latin and greek but no cyrillic.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm just not understanding
  the Fontlab interface?  After I create a new file, I can flip through the options
  in the drop down menu at the top of the window--MacOS, ISO, Windows....  So maybe
  all the blank empty slots for the glyphs ARE there?  Usually when I open a well
  made font in fontlab I see all the glyphs of the entire font all in one window,
  that is I don't have to flip through the various OS/ISO settings to see the greek
  or diacritics, for example.\r\n\r\nHow can I get all the glyphs for all these languages
  all in one \"window\"? (sorry my terminology is lacking here)\r\n\r\nThanks, all."

  body: Those different Font window options are just showing you subsets of possible
    characters you can add to your font. When you select one of these views, you can
    build characters in that subset. If you switch the view to a different subset,
    you can build characters in that subset. Any characters you have already made
    that are not part of the current subset will be displayed at the bottom of the
    Font window in the order you created them. (You can change the order in the Index
    Mode view.)

  body: "Thanks, Mark. Is there anyway to create my own subset perhaps, or view the
    entire font all as one subset?  I would much prefer to do it this way if possible.
    \r\n\r\nI found the Latin + Cyrillic + Greek subset.  I didn't notice it before
    because it was abbreviated.  I would say most of greek I don't want to tackle
    yet, but I do want to do the glyphs: franc lira euro (number sign \"no.\") trademark,
    omega, estimated, delta, product, etc, up until longs_t.  \r\n\r\nIt would be
    great if there were away to delete the majority of the greek from the subset,
    and create like, my own foundry's subset, somehow as a fontalb subset or a .vfb
    file that I can use from the start of design a font."

  body: "I saved these instructions from an earlier Typophile thread, but not the
    name of the author, so apologies to him/her for the lack of a credit:\r\n\r\nSelect
    all the glyphs and hit copy. Then paste into a text editor, which will dump all
    the names with slashes in front of them. Then find/replace all of the slashes
    with line breaks in Indesign, Textwrangler, etc. After that add a header and you\u2019re
    done.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nYou can always rearrange the glyphs in Index Mode and then
    Save the Encoding file. Relaunch FontLab and select the new encoding scheme under
    Names\r\n\r\nIn Index mode, you can drag the glyphs around and rearrange them.
    Once you have an ordering you like, choose Glyph > Glyph Names > Save Encoding.
    (This is only available in Index mode.)\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you want to start
    with a particular existing encoding before you start rearranging glyphs, switch
    to Names mode, select the encoding, then choose Glyph > Sort Glyphs > By Encoding.
    When you go to Index mode, the glyphs will be arranged in this order."
