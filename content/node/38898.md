body: What is the typeface used for body copy in the Rolling Stone magazine? I have
  gone through about 40 typefaces trying to identify certain letters, and still cannot
  come up with an exact match. There's a sans serif and a serif that I see used in
  articles, and I'd like to find out what they are if possible.
