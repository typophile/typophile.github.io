  body: "If you could do a screen shot showing the unfilled outline, including the
    on- and off-curve nodes, we could give some more helpful advice.\r\n\r\nIt looks
    as if perhaps you have an on-curve point whose corresponding BCP is collapsed
    right onto the point, causing what you want to be a smooth curve to exhibit a
    bit of a \"kink.\" But without seeing the point structure it is hard to be sure.
    There are many ways to mess up a curve, unfortunately!  :)"

    try this again...\r\nIn your first image\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/smooth_4931.png\r\nthe
    worst offender is the inside curve of the bottom-right element.\r\nCould you show
    a screengrab from FontLab with all the control points?\r\n\r\nBTW in FontLab,
    Alt-Shift-Click balances the control points in a curve.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    actually in the part you do show, the vertex at the top of the inside curve (right
    above the 402 guide) has control points that are not aligned. If you do that more
    deliberately that can actually work (assuming it's made to carry through the entire
    font) but here it's close-but-not-exact, which makes it look simply wrong.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
