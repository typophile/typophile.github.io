body: "We have a letterpress sample in hand. Printed on uncoated stock(highly calibrated
  smooth stock), Inks used may be magenta or rubine red, or rhodamine. We can print
  but not match the sample. The sample has a smooth sheen when slightly tilted in
  light. As if there is gold uniformity sitting on the sample.\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen
  this kind of effect? If so please tell me what I need to do to enhance this smooth
  gold effect to be shown on our print. We have tried double hits/printing on transparent
  opaque inks and then print the above inks etc but cannot get the correct result.
  The pigments in the inks have this gold content but will not settle smoothly. Any
  help will be appreciated. This is very technical question please."

    possible what you have was not printed at all, but stamped with a colored foil. '
