    like it might be closest. Anyways it would be lovely to know what the Wonderland
    Magazine font actually is :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SackersSolidAntiqueRoman_5730.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wonderland_5849_5942.jpg]"

  body: "good catch! and very close too.\r\n\r\nSomeone in another thread regarding
    these extreme hairline fonts is that these probably are done in illustrator with
    a white stroke added around the type... modifications here and there of course."
