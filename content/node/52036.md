  poster he did for Amtrak. \r\nCan you help me identify this font? I know he starts
  with one and then either hand draws. \r\nIn fact I might have asked this question
  here before, but I've forgotten the name. \r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n-m\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/posterface_4512.jpg]"
