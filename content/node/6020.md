  body: Hrant bite your tongue, shallow . . . . Sheeesh! :D <BR> <BR>Seriously, I&#39;ve
    designed both text and display and I honestly consider text to BE display just
    with more rules and different goals. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure somebody will jump
    don&#39;t my throat here and tell me they are totally different but it&#39;s still
    the same number of letters, attention to spacing and kerning and make no mistake
    COLOR is just as important to a display face as a text one. <BR> <BR>Beyond that,
    I have a grass is greener on the other side philosophy about designing text since
    display is my preference. I would love to design the next Helvetica or Times so
    I am compelled to experiment to figure out what works and why with text designs.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s like sitting down to design a display font and saying my goal
    is to create something that looks like a 1940s Chinese menu. I can easily judge
    the success of the face or not when I&#39;ve gotten a few glyphs into it. I think
    the same goes for a text face if I define a goal for it before I start. <BR> <BR>I
    enjoy making fonts, all kinds of fonts and I highly suggest that a type design
    NEEDS to actually make both kinds at least once. It&#39;ll raise acute design
    issues they hadn&#39;t considered in there preferred font making style. <BR> <BR>My

    first part, but believe that at the very top end of text face design the second
    part is untrue. It might sound paradoxical, but a &#34;real&#34; text face needs

    how to use what font where. <BR> <BR>For instance, you could use a &#34;text&#34;
    face if you want a bit of sturdiness -- maybe you are doing a subtle tonal effect,
    or running type over a busy picture, or printing on  a very textured stock. Or
    you want to make the type look like has been blown up big, really in your face,
    say with a high contrast image or an image with a coarse graphic screen. Or maybe
    you are going to give the type a faux effect, and you need the heft to withstand
    the distress. <BR> <BR>At the opposite end, you can use display faces quite small
    on coated paper, especially on a small sheet that people will hold close. And

    correction is a fact of life, and it seems &#40;to me at least&#41; that the practice

    about the bouma thing today and it dawned on me--if words can have established
    shape recognition, why can&#39;t individual letters.  They obviously can.  Still
    seems like a chirographic convention to me--the broad-nib pen is the genesis of
    certain &#34;sub-stroke&#34; features &#40;like the one in bicameral &#34;a&#34;,
    moving from the start of the bowl and into the lower portion--this can&#39;t be

    <BR> <BR>With a huge difference: no optical scaling. Different cuts for different
    sizes are what make a typeface suitable for text and display - and at that point
    you might say it&#39;s no longer the same typeface - you would certainly say it&#39;s
    no longer the same font. <BR> <BR>If you look at the optical progression in ATF
    Garamond, you&#39;ll notice gradual curves below 12 and above 14, but an abrupt
    shift between 12 and 14. That&#39;s because the ATF boys saw that as the cutoff
    between text and display. Usually I myself would put it between 11 and 12, but
    considering that Garamond is small on the body, it makes sense. <BR> <BR>And if
    you put the 6 point ATF Garamond &#40;enlarged&#41; next to the 48 point ATF Garamond
    next to Times, and you ask laymen &#34;which two fonts are the same&#34;, you&#39;ll

    <BR> <BR>&#62;reading theory is bunk <BR> <BR>A. Scott&#39;s question was &#39;do
    you find the designing of text faces to be too &#34;academic&#34;?&#39; <BR>No,
    but discussing it can get that way. <BR> <BR>As far as I&#39;m concerned, reading
    theory has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the CRAFT of making a typeface. The old
    guys who designed all the most readable faces managed perfectly well without if
    FOR CENTURIES. <BR> <BR>Sure, science and LOGIC can help explain how people and
    things work, but whenever they are used as the basis of creativity the results
    tend to be BANAL and inhuman. <BR> <BR>As Rilke said &#40;sorry, this is from
    memory, of a translation&#41; &#34;ONLY THROUGH LOVE can one understand a work
    of art&#34;. There&#39;s enough art in typography to make his statement applicable.
    <BR> <BR>&#62;I honestly consider text to BE display just with more rules and
    different goals. <BR> <BR>Right on, Stuart. And I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the way
    Nic Jenson worked on the definitive roman type, which was what we would consider
    a large text size, around 14 pt in size. Like all subsequent type designers who
    have produced a smooth text face, he was obviously very UP CLOSE AND INTIMATE
    WITH HIS GLYPHS, and THE WAY THEY COMBINE with one another. <BR> <BR>For text,
    as opposed to display, the principles are simple: <BR>1. Sturdier details &#40;eg
    thicker hairlines and serifs&#41; <BR>2. Avoid small counters <BR>3. Wider sidebearings
    and serifs <BR>It&#39;s that simple -- if you follow these principles, you can
    turn any display type into a text type. However, if your typeface has uneven color
    as a display face, it will have uneven color as a text face too, and such faults
    tend to be more obvious at text size.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>I do agree that sans type for the most part don&#39;t make the most ideal

    a good many years I convinced myself that I disliked Bodoni . . .all Bodoni, because

    Scour the internet and look for the new Ancient Greek &#40;sans&#41; that Dann
    Carr has cut for a book titled Fragments of Parmenides, printed and published
    by Peter Koch. The text was translated by Robert Bringhurst. It&#39;s a really

    italic for a broadsheet wherein the entire text was set in this display size.
    I have seen others do the same kind of thing and the effect is striking. So perhaps
    this is a little off the discussion, but it IS the use of a display type for text.
    If you scaled that same display fce down into 12 point and set the same text the
    effect might be less successful. <BR> <BR>There have been many comparison studies
    made by scaling different type-size fonts to a common size to compare weight and
    stroke. I don&#39;t think anyone ever came to common understanding over it. So
    a text face is often huskier and has differing perameters, and if you blow it
    up, it becomes a medium weight, and not always graceful. <BR> <BR>Sumner Stone
    designed a lovely face that he has named Arepo, and considers it a display face.
    I wonder if it wouldn&#39;t serve well as a text type. It has all the attributes

    forms are refreshing if they work technically good. <BR> <BR>No face can -or should-
    be totally transparent. But there is a qualitative difference between the transparency
    needed in text versus display design, and this is due to the nature of the intended
    reading experience: deliberative, where we have time to read a handful of words
    and we can consciously appreciate the formal details; versus immersive, where
    the subconsious reading mechanism takes over, because it becomes a performance
    issue. Readability really only matters when a reader is pushing the limits of
    perception/cognition - otherwise virtually everything is pretty legible. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; it IS the use of a display type for text. <BR> <BR>Only if you use a
    peculiar -maybe pointless- definition of &#34;text&#34;. <BR>Really <i>any</i>
    text is &#34;text&#34;, even if it&#39;s one word. But a <i>useful</i> definition
    of &#34;text&#34; versus &#34;display&#34; entails a consideration of how humans
    read. It&#39;s been shown for example that when a font is too large reading slows
    down a lot. So to me &#34;text&#34; means a setting that crosses into the subconscious,
    immersive mechanism. This is where boumas start to matter, and where an x-height
    can be too large for example, or spacing too loose. This to me is a useful boundary
    to think about in the text/display discussion. <BR> <BR>&#62; If you scaled that
    same display fce down into 12 point and <BR>&#62; set the same text the effect
    might be less successful. <BR> <BR>Exactly, and not just aesthetically, but functionally.
    <BR>And what does that tell you? <BR> <BR>&#62; not always graceful. <BR> <BR>Exactly.
    And that&#39;s why I say &#34;ugliness&#34; has merit in text face design, because
    it&#39;s really only ugly at the deliberative level. At the immersive level it&#39;s
    <i>required</i> to make a text font &#34;click&#34; for real. <BR> <BR>&#40;I
