  \"p\", as well as the body text (I assume this is not the same font family).\r\n\r\nWhere
  the \"p\" was found (samples of high fashion style fonts): http://brandrelevance.tumblr.com/post/3087015234/fashion-type\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be most appreciated!\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nTiara"

  body: I can't help with the ID, but IMO the bottom of the bowl of that p has some
    real problems as it transitions from the thick to the thin.
