  the URW fonts supplied with Coreldraw X4 are technically faulty. Whosoever is familiar
  with engraving machine fonts may download the PDF file\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/corel14.pdf\r\n\r\nand
  may zoom to 1000 percent and more a few typical letters which in my opinion are
  technically defective, e.g. on page 4 of font \"G4L S14 Fette Din Mittel\" these
  letters:\r\n\r\n6 (left downstroke at bowl intersection)\r\n9 (right downstroke
  at bowl intersection)\r\n^ (top roof)\r\na (downstroke at bowl intersection)\r\nb,
  d, g, h, m etc. (downstrokes at bowl intersections)\r\n\r\netc. etc. etc."

  body: "URW offered a number of digitisation services and options to clients. Their
    recommendation was always manual digitisation from artwork, but under pressure
    from customers they also developed an autotracing method to speed up the process.
    As Dr Karow and his colleagues at URW recall* most of the fonts that were made
    in this way later underwent a lot of manual cleanup, or were redigitised manually,
    but in the hurry to make fonts available in new formats some customers shipped
    autotraced outlines with various kinds of problems. I've had to work with such
    outlines a few times, and share Dr Karow's view that in the long-term autotracing
    didn't really speed things up, because if you wanted good quality you would have
    to spend a lot of time cleaning up the outlines eventually. As well as problems
    in the autotraced IK data itself, I believe the IK-to-bezier conversion had further
    problems with such data, producing some really nasty outlines in final font format.
    This was never a problem with the manually digitised IK data.\r\n\r\n\r\n*As explained
    at, for instance, the recent DTL font conference in The Hague."
