  body: Already discussed [[http://typophile.com/node/106577|here]]. I suspect a bespoke
    typeface though. What's the sample origin? Wasn't able to find it the first time
    (was expecting to find a WebFont).

  body: Thanks Ryuk, it could easily be custom, though I haven't seen Acne use it
    in it's email blasts since. The attached is the jpg embedded in an email blast.
    I believe that is the sample origin you're inquiring about?

  body: Thanks for the answer. Do you still have this email? I'm actually expecting
    the type to be embedded as WebFont in this email... Best would be to visualize
    this email directly through a browser and inspect CSS code. But if the image has
    been processed with the text, everything's is useless.
