  maybe get a little feedback on the very little work I have.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DentalNewsTypophile1_6348.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DentalNewsTypophile2_4954.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  drawing this on Illustrator. Is it a bad idea?\r\nThanks for any feedback. :)"

    thing, but you have no control over spacing. So you\u2019d be better off with
    a font editor software."

  body: Yes, keep going. v does look a little narrow. B looks a little dark, N a little
    light. But draw the other glyphs and see which way to change the weight.

    to install FontForge it's a bit complicated. I guess everything has a price, even
    a free software :)\r\n\r\nI did make the V a bit wider and the A and Y as well\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DentalNewsTypophile3_3680.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DentalNewsTypophile4_3454.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    lowercase letters I have here are only a 60% scaling of the capitals\r\nI find
    the X a bit awkward, the left counter space seems and huge and imbalanced but
    I don't know how to fix it."

    lot of the letters are still clumsy as drawings. And I realise I have inconsistencies
    in width and colour. But yeah I need help on that :)\r\n\r\nI still think that
    this is more of a Semi-Bold compared to the intended result. It's really meant
    to be a text typeface for a magazine at something like 9/12. But I took Bendy's
    advise and drew most of the capitals to better judge the relationship between
    letters.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys."

  body: "The curve of the P is too thin. Perhaps the upper curve of B & R as well.
    \r\n\r\nThe counter of the O looks a bit skewed. I don't know if this is intentional,
    though?\r\n\r\nSome of the hairlines could be a bit thin for body text.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like a positively classical and restrained alphabet to me. The R looks maybe a
    bit too modern in this context.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sorry it's been a while but one of my Hard Drives went belly-up and I was
    working on recovering some of the files. I have lost a file where I had refined
    the serifs, but I don't think it was a great idea anyway, not at this stage at
    least.\r\n\r\nI made the face lighter, I think what I have now will produce a
    better colour at text size. I used Karen Cheng's  \"Designing Type\" book to determine
    width relationships between letters and it's more of a classic proportions typeface.
    The original idea was to somehow blend Modern and Classic elements but I went
    with Classic instead. Hopefully it'll be identified as \"contemporary\" when it's
    done.\r\n\r\nThe \"R\" was indeed out of place. The skew on the O's counter was
    intentional but I guess it was too geometric, I adjusted that slightly I don't
    know maybe it still is awkward.\r\n\r\nI've redrawn the counters for the B P &
    R. I'm satisfied with the stroke weight relationship now, but I could be wrong.
    Let's see what everyone thinks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DentalNewsTypophile_Alphabet3_6031.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DentalNewsTypophileSpecimen!_3658.png]\r\n\r\nI
    wanted to make a couple of notes on some of the letterforms, but I'll just wait
    for undistorted feedback (e.g. I'm in a hurry to go to school :P)"

  body: "The R is too Bemboesque. Also the flared M is going too much in the Renaissance
    style direction. As well as the broad-nip pen reminescence of the J. X is better,
    the downstroke of the K should be straight. The P\u2019s stroke of the bowl is
    still too light, also the top one of B. The U is too wide. I\u2019d also narrow
    the C a bit. The diagonal downstrokes of V, W, X and Y seem too thin."

  body: "I'd disagree with the last post. I think the classical R and M look good,
    but the J looks out of place. Maybe the curve on K and R could be reduced, but
    I don't think straight is necessary.\r\nIt's a bit difficult to judge how this
    looks from a small image. I'd be interested to see a pdf and text in sentences.
    I think this is going to look very nice."

    refined the J tell what you think of the new one in the PDF, but the thing is,

    clumsy drawings. I want to make the tail of the Q more pronounced. Other than
    that I'm happy with the letterforms but it feels like the text doesn't flow consistently.
    The original intended use of the typeface was all-caps headings for my resum\xE9
    so.\r\nI started drawing the lower case but I would love to refine the caps first.\r\nI'm
    looking at a print out of that PDF and I think spacing is really poor and inconsistent
    I'll get me a font editor and start working on that soon."

  body: "Yes, good improvements! I\u2019m still not sure about the J: this detail
    is found nowhere else in that alphabet*. But you should elaborate a bit on the
    tail of the Q: that could be much longer & more elegant.\r\nThe middle bar of
    H seems too heavy. Me thinks that the right upstroke of U is a bit too thin. And
    maybe the thin strokes of N a bit too heavy, whereas the diagonal could be slightly
    heavier.\r\nThe bow of D should have the same weight as the ones of O and C.\r\nS
    should be haevier in the middle, work on the horizontal thin strokes at the top
    and the bottom, they are too different.\r\nThe U is still too wide. Place your
    X into the text as well to see what needs to be changed there. It drwas too much
    attention to its serifs.\r\nThe overall proportions look good now.\r\n\r\n*) I
    know J is your initial, that is why you drew it first, but it looks like from
    a different alphabet."
