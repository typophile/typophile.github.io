  font family like Thesis ( www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/thesis-family ) or Fedra ( www.typotheque.com/fonts
  ). It's important that the typeface supports latin, greek and cyrillic.\r\n\r\nIf
  you don't know any family that supports Serif AND Sans Serif, maybe you know different
  Fonts that may fit?\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\n\r\nJuergen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
