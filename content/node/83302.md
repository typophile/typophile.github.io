  company has used it for years and want to show them alternatives. Looking for a
  san serif font that is clean and crisp font that reads well. Something fun or trendy
  will not work for our company. I have attached a copy.  Thanks for suggestions I
  am going to review every suggestion.  I would like to talk them into U/L\r\nThank
  you,\r\nT\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo 4 Typography_6230.jpg]\r\n"
