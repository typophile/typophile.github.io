  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi
We are rebranding our (training) company and our logo uses Bryant font from Process. I'm wondering if anyone has paired Bryant with a serif font for immersive reading. So far the suggestions have been Officina Serif, Minion and Georgia. To me these don't quite work and I've had a look at Meta Serif, Utopia, Melior and Fedra Serif B. I might licence the first two of these to see which looks nicest and post some samples for crit here, but first of all wondered if anyone had a combination they thought was really successful.

Unfortunately I'm finding Bryant a bit difficult to use as there's so much space between the letters and the wide rounded tone feels a bit too cartoony next to very sober fonts (it looked very strange next to Garamond, Minion and New Baskerville!)

(Actually I thought that Myriad looked neat with Bryant, they do contrast quite well despite both being sans serif designs. Obviously there's the tension between humanist and geometric, rounded and flat terminals, so maybe that explains it. But our creative director said they didn't work too well together.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's Bryant paired with Meta Serif and with Officina Serif. To me, it looks like Officina Serif is too busy (too many corners) and too narrow and too quirky for immersive reading. And it's also been around a few years. Does anyone disagree that Meta Serif works well as a companion to Bryant?

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, thanks William. I'm not exactly wanting to match characteristics because I think the wide proportions of Bryant won't allow enough text on the page for extended body copy. I'm creating a brochure with Bryant for headings, subheadings and quotes, then need something to give details and descriptions of services. I need something space-efficient, readable and harmonising (so contrasting rather than matching I guess). I thought the square forms and terminals of Meta Serif would balance out the almost overpowering roundness of Bryant, whilst the vertical stress seems to relate to the geometric and monolinear structure of Bryant in a way that something like Garamond, Sabon or Minion didn't. And it's lower contrast than New Baskerville.</div>

What about something in-between the oldstyles and what you've tried above? Does [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman|Whitman]] strike you at all as a suitable companion? Wider forms, simple structure, smallish x-height, modest contrast . . .

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, that's really interesting as I tried Bodoni and Joanna along the way. I think Modern serif fonts fit well with Bryant, so Whitman would be a good companion. It looks nice and elegant. 

For my brochure though, I think I'm looking for something more humanist (meaning that Officina Sans and Meta Sans strike me as humanist, and their Serif siblings are built from the same bones). I worry that there's a bit too much roundness in Bryant, so I'm after something where the curves and counters are a bit less round looking.

Jos, thanks for posting this; as you know I'm quite excited by Calluna, and especially the italic (vwxyz are enviable). I'm not sure if you're looking for critique and this isn't the right thread anyway. As for my brochure, I think it has the right tone but to me the oldstyle stress doesn't sit very comfortably with Bryant's unsophisticated geometry.

It'll be interesting to see what others think of these combinations.</div>

I think Whitman might be great too. A bit more "literary" than Scala maybe? It looks "harder" next to the utter roundness of Bryant than Scala does, too.
I think Calluna is not a bad match either, but next to Bryant it looks *very* old-style. Not sure if that's the intended tone?</div>

Yes, that's kind of what I was trying to mean. It's certainly elegant but I'm not really after a literary look for a brochure. I'd agree with 'harder' too. 

I fear Scala is a bit wild and out of control next to bubbly young Bryant. It's an intersting font, I can't say I really understand it.

If the proportions don't match, try horizontal scaling your text type to make the curves closer to the roundness of Bryant.</div>

But this is impossible to say without knowing anything about the layout and typography. FWIW, exactly regarding Whitman, I'm currently preparing a brochure and typesetting a book with it, and at least to me it feels quite young and fresh (but still serious and intelligent) in one, and quite classical (if still fresh and witty) in the other. Different, is my point.

<em>"try horizontal scaling your text type"</em>
?!

Regarding Scala: Nobody typesets AaBbCc, so the font's never going to look like that. This is what I was looking at:

		<div class="commentbody">Is this Bryant's original fitting in the sample just above this post? That "bur" looks er, interesting.

FWIW. I think your PDF is quite nice! Stag seems serious enough to rein in Bryant's chubby cuteness.
Personally, I'd make the subheads bolder. And/or bigger; or the text smaller. 
The text seems louder now than the titles; I think the whole thing still looks a bit unbalanced. Actually, if you can't make them sing together, I think I'd let go of the idea that the logo font needs to figure in the typography. It might seem forced if it doesn't flow.
Note, this probably sounds worse than I actually think it is.

I think that's the original metrics on Bryant, unless I inadvertently had optical spacing switched on in PS.

I too was worried about the relative importance of the headings. I'll see what happens with Bryant Medium and Bold and larger sizes. I find the heavier weights a bit too sausagey for my taste. Thanks for that suggestion, I think you're right anyway.</div>

Just one other suggestion -- take a look at the Century-type fonts, particularly Century Schoolbook and Excelsior (ok, that one's a newspaper type). I've always liked Excelsior for its wide stance, and I think it may look nice with Bryant.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Kent, that's kind of you, I'll drop you an e-mail. I just had another look at Whitman and I must say the Modern style has suddenly grown on me after leaving me cold for years. And it certainly does look very nice with Bryant :) 

(I still think it looks quite formal and elegant so may not be exactly right for this brochure, unfortunately)

Seems like there's agreement that Officina Serif works well against Bryant, but is it suitable for long, body copy?</div>

Bryant medium is too sausagey, the regular weight pairs better with both Meta and Stag, but I'm still finding this a real challenge... :(
