  graphic).\r\n\r\nI thought about creating a glyph out of it. Is that the way to
  do it? \r\n\r\nI do not own a Font-Design software myself. Can anyone point me to
  either a font that has it already in its glyphs or help me out with a freeware software
  to use for this? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMiri"

    for the eulogie added after the mention of allah? \r\nI own an earlier version
    of InDesign, so I do not yet have access to the font.  I might come back with
    more questions once I have the font.\r\nThanks for your help,\r\nMiriam"

  body: This glyph is standard in many Arabic fonts, including all Linotype's Arabic
    OpenType fonts. It is also in Microsoft's 'Arabic Typesetting' font, and in Adobe
    Arabic. The Linotype and Adobe Arabic fonts contain both Arab and Persian forms.
