  body: Yep, looks like they just used <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/electric_typographer/tagliente/&sample_text=Polynesian%20Fantasy&sample_size=94">Tagliente</a>
    right out of the box, without kerning. The digitization and kerning are not great.
    Might I suggest <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/spira_light_italic/&sample_text=Polynesian%20Fantasy&sample_size=60">Spira</a>,
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/artemisia_light/&sample_text=Polynesian%20Fantasy&sample_size=55">Artemisia</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/poetica_chancery_i/&sample_text=Polynesian%20Fantasy&sample_size=70">Poetica</a>
    as alternatives.
