  very subtle rounded edges, similar to Rotunda by Helios Capdevila, but looking for
  something not mono. Some character is ok.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rotonda-alphabet-800_4899.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  help or thoughts would be appreciated! Thanks."

    be a candidate, more so for all-caps setting.\r\nThe lower case has single-bowl
    \u201Cg\u201D as an alternate, but no single-bowl \u201Ca\u201D.\r\n\r\n"

    Very subtly rounded corners.
