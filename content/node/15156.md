    body: hmm, well, I need something that is going to be read on TV at a smaller
      size and those two are a little too bold... the example of DutchMaster is taller
      and wider and a little thinner. MacBeth is very close, but not quite going to
      work... let me know if you know of anything else... thanks for your quick responses
      though... I am still looking myself.

    and all those links I found for 'Silver Graphics' or 'Great American Font Works'
    were outdated, of course.. So, Sorry, But, I have no clue where you could possibly
    still find that CD..\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\" target=\"_blank\">formlos</a>"
