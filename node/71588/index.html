<p>Everything is working now, but the code feels rather heavy.</p>
<p>Also, the frames are built from parts and the rendering of each part sometimes differs (only on screen). That’s the reason I’m asking about overlapping shapes. It would be so much easier if I could just keep the rectangles as whole shapes and kern them in place instead of piecing them together.</p>

<p>you can simplify the code creating a class with all the alternate figures (I called this @figalts) and rearranging the lookups this way:</p>
<code>
feature ss01 {
 lookup figthree {
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures zero' by zero.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures one' by one.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures two' by two.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures three' by three.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures four' by four.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures five' by five.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures six' by six.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures seven' by seven.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures eight' by eight.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures @figures nine' by nine.multiple;
 } figthree;
</code><code>
 lookup figtwo {
  sub bracketleft @figures zero' by zero.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures one' by one.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures two' by two.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures three' by three.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures four' by four.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures five' by five.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures six' by six.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures seven' by seven.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures eight' by eight.multiple;
  sub bracketleft @figures nine' backetright by nine.multiple;
 } figtwo;
</code><code>
 lookup figone {
  sub bracketleft zero' @figalts by zero.multiple;
  sub bracketleft one' @figalts by one.multiple;
  sub bracketleft two' @figalts by two.multiple;
  sub bracketleft three' @figalts by three.multiple;
  sub bracketleft four' @figalts by four.multiple;
  sub bracketleft five' @figalts by five.multiple;
  sub bracketleft six' @figalts  by six.multiple;
  sub bracketleft seven' @figalts by seven.multiple;
  sub bracketleft eight' @figalts by eight.multiple;
  sub bracketleft nine' @figalts by nine.multiple;
 } figtone;
</code><code>
 lookup figmono {
  sub bracketleft zero' backetright by zero.mono;
  sub bracketleft one' backetright by one.mono;
  sub bracketleft two' backetright by two.mono;
  sub bracketleft three' backetright by three.mono;
  sub bracketleft four' backetright by four.mono;
  sub bracketleft five' backetright by five.mono;
  sub bracketleft six' backetright by six.mono;
  sub bracketleft seven' backetright by seven.mono;
  sub bracketleft eight' backetright by eight.mono;
  sub bracketleft nine' backetright by nine.mono;
 } figmono;
</code><code>
 lookup left {
  sub bracketleft' @figalts by bracketleft.square;
 } left;
</code><code>
 lookup right {
  sub @figalts bracketright' by bracketright.square;
 } right;
} ss01;
</code>
<p>As you can see, @figalts was created just to permit the replacement in an easier way.</p>
<p>This code has a problem: it will change any text between brackets and beginning with two or three numbers, what may not be desired. Your original code also permits undesired substitution, although it restricts the field to [<em>1-3</em>x].</p>
<p>As this is a stylistic set, the user probably will apply it throught a character style. So, he/she will hardly get undesired substitutions. If this is an issue, you can adopt another standard to indicate indexed numbers (as two brackets instead of one) and reduce to near zero the possibility to get wrong results.</p>
<p>[I have no time to test this code now, but I plan to do this soon.]</p>

sub bracketleft @figures @figures seven' by seven.multiple;
sub bracketleft @figures @figures eight' by eight.multiple;
sub bracketleft @figures @figures nine' by nine.multiple;</code></p>
<p>you simply could write</p>
<p><code>sub bracketleft @figures @figures @figures' by @figures_Multiple</code></p>
<p>This only requires, that the order is the same in @figures and @figures_Multiple.</p>
<p><cite>It would be so much easier if I could just keep the rectangles as whole shapes and kern them in place instead of piecing them together.</cite></p>
<p>In this case you would replace the bracketleft by the whole square and the bracketright by a glyph with a width of zero? This should work, especially because not the outlines would overlap, but the glyphs only. But you even would not need kerning, if the square had a negative right sidebearing. You would need two squares. One for the singles and doubles and one for the triples.</p>
<p>I assume, that your multiple and mono figures are actually over- and underlined. Correct?</p>
<p>Edited:</p>
<p>Misunderstanding. You mean the overlapping of the outlines of the brackets, right? This can indeed be avoided by replacing the left or the right bracket with a square and the other by an empty character with a width of zero.</p>
<p><code>sub bracketleft @figures' bracketright by @figures_mono;
sub bracketleft @figures @figures @figures' bracketright by @figures_multiple;
sub bracketleft @figures @figures' bracketright by @figures_multiple;
sub bracketleft @figures' bracketright by @figures_multiple;
sub bracketleft' @figures_multiple @figures_multiple @figures_multiple by bracketleft.rectangle;
sub bracketleft' [@figures_mono @figures_multiple] by bracketleft.quadrat;
sub [@figures_mono @figures_multiple] bracketright' by bracketright.EmptyAndZeroWidth;</code></p>
<p>bracketleft.quadrat and bracketleft.rectangle have a negative right sidebearing, that is almost as big as their width (exclusively the left sidebearing).</p>

<p><code>feature ss01 {

<p>The overlapping idea is also possible, although I&rsquo;d preffer the code above. It seems to be more complex to handle overlapping squares and numbers than to do straigthforward replacements.</p>

<p>I think, that overlapping is problematical, if outlines overlap. For a few programs this may be problematical. But in my concept outlines are not overlapping. You could copy the square outline to a figure in FontLab and it would work. Path directions had not to be changed.</p>

<p>I prefer coding, when I can test the code, but I am too lazy for creating a font just for testing code. I wanted to avoid, that figures are substituted, that are in context of more than two other figures. And it would be possible to create a code for the invers feature.</p>
<p>However, I think the principle is clear enough. And maybe it already was a help, that you can put classes in brackets for building another set or that you can substitute classes. This probably does not work only in the features, but also, when you define classes. This was missing in the beginning, at least partly.</p>
<p>By the way, why are the lookups in your code?</p>

<code>
class @this: a e i o u

When you do a command like  <code>sub @this by @that</code>,  if OT engine finds u in your text, it will replace this u by the glyph in the same position from the class @that. In this example, the 5th character, ü.</p>

<p><cite>What do you mean by “the order is the same in @figures and @figures_Multiple”?</cite></p>
<p>Freiberger answered in the post above.</p>
<p><cite>And, another question while I’m at it. If I kern a glyph to overlap another, is there some way to make sure the overlap will be knocked out? It’s easily done with multiple shapes inside a glyph (ex: the inner shape of O is knocked out of the outer).</cite></p>
<p>Somehow I have misunderstood that question. You want to knockout paths of two <em>different</em> glyphs. This may work in some applications, but for sure not in all. I tried something similar <strong><a href="http://typophile.com/node/59648">here</a></strong> with a shape, that had the wrong path direction. I thought, that this shape would not be visible. So I assume, that you have to provide two sets of invers figures, mono_invers and multiple_invers.</p>
<p>The other problem, that you had, are rounding inaccuracies. And I assume, that they are partly caused by the hinting. I think, that can be avoided only, if you let the glyphs overlap with the help of negative sidebearings or kerning with the intention, that the overlapping parts do <strong>not</strong> knockout. In other words you could close small vertical wholes with the help of overlapping the black shapes. This should work in almost all applications. And this behavior of the applications is good, because otherwise you had to shorten the serifs instead of a negative kerning for a letter combination like XA in E<strong>XA</strong>MPLE.</p>

I understood the OT perfectly and when I fixed the typos it worked like a charm. I’m not sure if I get why you chose to ignore the bracketright until the end.

<p>Because with bracketright you have more situations to replace and have to declare all of them:
<code>
[XX<strong>X</strong>]
[X<strong>X</strong>X]
[<strong>X</strong>XX]
[X<strong>X</strong>]
[<strong>X</strong>X]
[<strong>X</strong>]
</code>
While ignoring the bracketright you reduce the situations:
<code>
[XX<strong>X</strong>
[X<strong>X</strong>
[<strong>X</strong>
[<strong>X</strong>]

And the code also becomes smaller (as you ommit bracketright from it).</p>

<p>There is the possibility to result undesired replacement of cases like [1993: Thing] or [12 cups]. I said in the post of 24.Jun.2010 9.24pm, this hardly would appears as the stylistic set demands character style, GREP style or manual formatting –and in all these cases user would apply it just to proper situations.</p>
<p>Frode font has just figures, so this is not an issue here. But for other fonts this is possible and the type designer must evaluate if another trigger besides [] is adequate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Frode, I don&rsquo;t know why Word acts in a different way. It may be doing a &lsquo;blind&rsquo; substitution (this is a suppostion, I&rsquo;m at my job now and cannot test this):</p>
<p>After user types [X, OT engine already finds the third case from the code and do the replace action. User follow typing XX but the OT engine does not understands the text is [XXX now and remains with the substituion already made.</p>
<p>I <strong>guess</strong> this is not an issue to InDesign because it handles GREP styles and paragraph composer, so the text is always under evaluation by the program. Word seems not to go so far.</p>
<p>If this is the situation, the code needs to be changed to be Word-compatible. So, the solution is to write a longer code like yours first try. The schema is
<code>
[XX<strong>X</strong>]
[X<strong>X</strong>X]
[<strong>X</strong>XX]
[X<strong>X</strong>]
[<strong>X</strong>X]
[<strong>X</strong>]
</code>
To avoid Word to replace [X and mess up things, the code needs to find the whole situation, including the bracketright.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to this later, probably this night, and then post results here.</p>

So one could ask, why the font contains standard figures, but not only the mono and the multi figures and their inverse counterparts or two fonts, one with the mono and the multi figures and one with their counterparts or four fonts, in which all figure types are split.</p>
