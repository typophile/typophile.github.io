  images? \r\n\r\nWas it all hand done or was there some photo-machine that would
  produce them.\r\n\r\nBelow are some attached examples of what I am referring to."

    But basically, yes, a screen was used to photograph a continuous-tone image and
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone\">prepare it for the printing
    process</a>. Whereas the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics\">raster</a>
    has to do with imaging on a video screen or computer monitor.\r\n\r\nIn the third
    example, perhaps there was some work done by hand."

  body: "I was looking through an old issue of Graphis Issue No. 92, and there was
    an old advertisement that offered services for 'Spezial-Raster' of images (German
    Company). They offer various catagories you could have it at, such as '40er Spezial-Raster'
    & '20er Spezial-Raster'. What does this mean, and is there any other process of
    doing it without that insane machine :O. \r\n\r\nAlso, why is the online software
    program called [[http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/|The Rasterbator]] if you still
    get kinda the same effects as the images attached?\r\n\r\nThanks Ricardo. I appreciate
    talking to people who used the archaic machinery, really fascinating!"

    I wasn't clear, sorry: the effects of both processes are indeed the same, or sufficiently
    similar. I was just splitting hairs to point out the different origins and uses
    of both methods: one from the print world, the other from the television/onscreen
    world.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the ads from the German company are for, or if they
    used the term \"raster\" for both print and screen.\r\n\r\nNeat fact I found out
    last night: \"raster\" comes from the Latin word rastrum, which means \"rake,\"
    as in: \"Screen images are made up of a pattern of several hundred parallel lines
    created by an electron beam 'raking' the screen from top to bottom at a speed
    of about one sixtieth of a second.\" (from <em>The Mac Designer's Handbook</em>,
    1992 edition, by Alastair Campbell.)"

    halftone and you can choose the dot/line etc and rate. Start with an upsampled
    1200 dpi image and you will get good results. \r\n\r\nUsed to be done on a stat
    camera as mentioned. You would lay a screen over your 100% image and impose the
    dot."

    Letraset, etc.). The sheets were adhesive-backed translucent film with halftone
    patterns printed on them in various sizes. They were used by illustrators and
    comic book artists a lot. You could cut out shapes with an X-acto knife and burnish
    it onto the art board, for instance. In the sheep illustration, it appears that
    several pattern sheets were overlaid at slightly different angles to get a moir\xE9
    effect and shading."
