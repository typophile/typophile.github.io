body: I use suitcase for font management on my OSX Mac and have found the built in
  font style sets a bit useless. Does anyone know if you can get some sort of database
  which can be loaded into suitcase which might provide a better set of classifcations
  for styles of most fonts. Or another way to find fonts on there styles. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Alec you can create your own keywords and assign those to fonts. I began doing
    that and realized I didn&#39;t want it after all, but it sounds like something
    you might consider.
