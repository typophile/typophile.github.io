  found out there is a lot of knowledge here. Although it might not be the appropriate
  forum to post this question I will give it a try. Hope there\u2019s someone here
  to put us in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThis summer I have finished this graphic
  art project which combines a Paul Auster text from The Book of Illussions with prints
  from Glenn Thomas:\r\nhttp://www.theinnerlifeofmartinfrost.com (see the right side
  for a pdf-file). \r\n\r\nThe artist tried to publish the book on his own but did
  not succeed. What interests me is:\r\nDoes someone here knows publishers who publish
  books like this?\r\n\r\nThanks for helping & giving suggestions.\r\nKjeld"

    looks like a very nice project but there are not a lot of 'publishers' per se
    who would take on a limited edition project such as this."

    for Book Arts right now, but it didn\u2019t result in a publisher or sponsor.
    If it\u2019s up to us it doesn\u2019t have to be a limited edition; which is also
    the result of the low budget we (don\u2019t) have...\r\n"

  body: A publisher is most likely to see it as a limited edition. Paul Auster is
    not exactly Stephen King and a book like this is costly to produce.

    body: "Both true. But although he\u2019s not Stephen King, he\u2019s still a pretty
      famous writer. \r\n\r\nWhat do you see as a limited edition in the US, btw?
      200 copies, 500 copies? More or less?\r\n"

  body: "The more you print the less limited it becomes. If you think you have something
    which collector's will want then you should print fewer and spend more on the
    production of it.\r\n\r\nOne example of this is the book about Gudrun Zapf von
    Hesse. Her book was printed in 3 varying ways, three different quanitities and
    three different prices. Price for each was aimed at a different kind of collector
    or bibliophile."

  body: He's famous, yes, but an illustrated edition of one of his books isn't going
    to fly off the shelves no matter how beautiful. I know Paul Auster is pretty well
    connected in the art world, can he make some connections with small art presses?
    Pace Editions perhaps? I really think that's the way to go rather than a publisher,
    unless it's a university (and they usually don't do illustrated books).
