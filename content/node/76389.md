  body: "Gelateria says it was based on shop lettering, and it is very similar to
    the sample, but it does not show the swashes used in the sample. It is also too
    heavy. I think there must be another font with more delicate detail, based on
    the same lettering.\r\n\r\nI think this question is still open. It looks like
    the sort of font Sudtipos folks would do, frankly.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
