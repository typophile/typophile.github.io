  coming up oh so soon, but in lieu of Boston I'm making plans for Lisbon this year.\r\n\r\nWould
  anyone going to the ATypI Conference in Lisbon like to split a room?\r\nAccomodation
  details are on the ATypI website here: http://www.atypi.org/06_Lisbon/50_accommodation\r\n\r\nI
  will be attending both the TypeTech forum and the conference, so I guess that I'll
  be planning on arriving in Lisbon on the night of Tuesday, September 26.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone is interested, you can either post here, or contact me through my Typophile
  profile.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan"

  body: Thank you for the link Tiffany. I saw Jean Baptiste's post when he first posted
    it, but someone contacted me off-list a few hours after I had put this up on Typophile.
    So I already have my accommodations taken care of.

    longer have a roommate for it (he got lucky and someone else has picked up his
    travel tab, so he doesn't need to split a room now). Any takers?\r\n\r\n"
