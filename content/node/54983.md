  body: Perhaps you need an exact match, but if there is some flexibility I would
    argue that most of these <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/copperplate_scripts/">formal
    scripts</a> are much better.

  body: "Thanks Stephen,\r\nSnell Roundhand is the closest yet.\r\nAnd I agree many
    you suggest are better.\r\nBut it's for an old, very traditional social association
    publication - it's amazing how strongly people connect to fonts, even if they
    are not really aware of it!\r\nJonathan"
