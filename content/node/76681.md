  body: I can imagine this is not a font at all, but rather generated pixels. [[http://www.emigre.com/EFoICoaD.php|Emigre's
    Lo-Res]] comes close.

  body: Looks to me it's a bitmap font, probably generated from a 7x9 matrix. Wouldn't
    be surprised if there was an EGA or VGA screen font with this look somewhere.
