		<div class="commentbody">From <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stanley Morison: his typographic achievement<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by James Moran: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;However, Morison's liking for the Arrighi-style italic was not followed when Van Krimpen designed Romulus, cut by Monotype in 1936. Its italic applied Morison's theoretical ideas in his essay <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Towards an Ideal Italic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where he had urged that the only function of the italic was to support the main roman letter. Romulus was therefore a sloped roman, but the result was not a happy one for the reader, as A. F. Johnson observed in a review in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Signature<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (No. 13, 1940) where he stated of the 'sloped roman': 'This may be logical, but results in a stiff and monotonous letter.' Both Morison and Van Krimpen later considered the experiment to be wrong in principle, but they discussed a script type for the Romulus family, and out of this came Van Krimpen's exquisite Cancelleresca Bastarda.&quot; (p. 142) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As to more modern use of the sloped roman, Knuth (1986) &ndash; although he did not specifically design a sloped roman &ndash; advocates use of a mathematically sloped roman in the context of mathematical text: &quot;Slanted roman type was introduced in the 1930s, but it first became widely used as an alternative to the conventional italic during the late 1970s. It can be beneficial in mathematical texts, since slanted letters are distinguishable from the italic letters in math formulas. The double use of italic type for two different purposes &ndash; for example, when statements of theorems are italicized as well as the names of variables in those theorems &ndash; has led to some confusion, which can now be avoided with slanted type.&quot; (p. 13) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, I have an aversion to slanted roman type; this is no slight against Romulus. Rather, it stems simply from seeing so many bad examples of artifically sloped roman type in advertising and text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, this is something I've researched a good deal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some fonts have had an italic that was replaced with another. Think Bembo. Some fonts have had a sloped-Roman which was later replaced by so-called &quot;true italics&quot;. Probably the best example is Electra. Morison influenced the creation of Electra's first italic. His ideology was solid (for a change), but he went in the wrong direction, taking the idea too literally. Other fonts have had two italics, one more italic than the other. Porbably the best example is Seria (although its first italic is unusable for emphasis). There's also a font which didn't have any italic at first, so people auto-sloped it. When the designer released a true italic, many users clamored for the old one! So the designer released the sloped-Roman as  a true separate alternative. That font is Treacy's Arrow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then there's Sauna, which has two italics with different levels of cusiveness (but the same slope). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the closest thing to the &quot;ideal&quot; that I've found, except: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) It's not a text face. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) You really want less cursiveness overall, especially in the less cursive one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Patria has an italic that's not really a sloped-roman but it's very rigid. There's also a second italics (at the moment with incompatible proportions however - a long story) which is basically a sloped-Roman with semi-serifs. It's called Harrier, and I actually see it as a next-generation book face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; &quot;Slanted roman type was introduced in the 1930s <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More like the 1830s&hellip; Well, in the second half of the 19th century. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most notably by Tuleu, Deberny's bastard son. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The true age of sloped-Romans is a little-know fact, which Morison deftly covered up. In the end, his single good idea was unoriginal. It's a good thing he wrote a lot of books. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Morison wanted italic types that are not too different from their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; roman counterparts, that perhaps share similar widths and proportions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From the famous Fleuron article -where you can see for example Morison taking a Roman, slanting it, then modifying it slightly- it seems that he was advocating an italic structurally similar to the Roman, yes, and even highly so. His problem with the conventional italic is that its informal structures introduce an unnecessary skewing of the Roman's &quot;voice&quot;. And he was right. For a reader the only real marker of an italic is its slope (which is why upright italics are just a bad joke). As a result, a sloped-Roman is in fact the ideal. This doesn't mean however that all the serifs have to be maintained, or the &quot;a&quot; has to remain binocular, etc. First of all, it has to look nice. But the point is that it doesn't have to be cursive to look nice. If you look at the  Deberny sample I linked to, you'll see a truly intelligent as well as attractive rendering of a slanted-Roman (unlike the stuff Morrison's contemporaries produced). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Trump Medi</div>

Foot serifs and general rigidity, even a non-descending f, these are all found in historical sloped lettering styles that are clearly not sloped romans per se, and which certainly predate the typographic concept of a sloped roman. I think we're making a mistake if we divide all sloped lettering into either 'sloped roman' or 'true italic': there is a variety of sloped lettering, which deserves to be more thoughtfully considered. Joanna italic certainly isn't cursive, but it is very far from being a sloped version of the roman: the compression of the letters is extreme, and quite contrary to Morison's idea of a sloped roman as a subservient style.</div>

The text is set in Electra, 10 / 12 x 19p6, 32 lines deep. Ruzicka specified the use of both the original italic and the cursive for different kinds of distinctions. Within text, the cursive is used for emphasis, foreign phrases, and titles of works; but captions and extended extracts from writings or interviews are set in the sloped roman. The effect is subtle and quite interesting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think I have the entire Electra correspondence, but I have Griffith's dossier on the project. When I get a chance, I'll look through it to see if there is anything substantial to report about the development of the two italics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have an ambition to redigitize Dwiggins's Electra, going back to the original Megenthaler drawings as the primary source.

		<div class="commentbody">My Master's thesis actually had a lot to do with the structural differences between roman and italic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, I'm in agreement with the idea that structural change in the letterforms is the critical feature in determining when you've got an italic instead of a sloped roman. If you want one big change to point at, I agree with John that a change from a double story to single story &quot;a&quot; is probably the clearest indicator. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see a usage for a less distinctive italic when it is going to be set fairly separately from the upright. But when it is being used mixed in with roman text, contrast is exactly what it necessary to help it stand out enough. It's just a question of what's enough contrast; I think it's pretty clear that I'm in the mainstream as believing that a cursive element is helpful in creating the necessary amount of contrast. My impression is that the kind of &quot;ideal italic&quot; Hrant would favor, I would find useless in any situation where it had to mix with roman. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice Master's topic! A copy of the paper anywhere? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; contrast is exactly what it necessary to help it stand out enough. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sure. But: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; It's just a question of what's enough contrast <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Degree of &quot;aggregate contrast&quot; shall we say is indeed the central issue, and we can talk about that (including the difference between the degree people [think they] want versus the degree designers tend to think they need versus the degree they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> need), but the real point here I think is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->types<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of contrast that can be used, and which are suitable in what ways. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Italics can stand out in various ways, such as slant, cursiveness, color, apparent size, narrowness, etc. and certainly most italics combine more than one of these*. What we need to try to figure out is: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) How much each factor contributes to the contrast, and in what contexts (most significantly in terms of display versus text work). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) What other &quot;baggage&quot; does each factor bring, and how is each type of baggage good/bad with respect to the italic's primary role (emphasis in a body of the Roman). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Patria's for example uses ALL the ones I list, mostly because I decided to make its slant very slight (1/16 = ~3.58 degrees), and it needed help pulling away from the Roman. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A telling indication that cursiveness is insufficient on its own is the simple truth that an &quot;upright italic&quot; (which I prefer to call &quot;cursive roman&quot;) just doesn't work for emphasis. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My feeling is that cursiveness: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Does indeed add to contract, but not much. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Is not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->indispensable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for good functionality. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) Can help or hinder depending on the nature of the Roman (and its proper use). For example, cursiveness is less welcome in a news face than it is in a coffee-table book about Italian art. Cursiveness brings an informality to the setting that might or might not be a good idea; in fact I think it's really a lousy default choice of contrast tactic. Part of the reason is that I think chirographic Romans are themselves flawed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most of all, I think what needs to be admitted is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is in fact the primary axis of differentiation, especially in immersive reading, where structural pedantisms such a deeper angle in the arches of h/n/m/u are secondary (even tertiary, when you consider that color for example is more significant). This is common sense, actually, and the main people resisting this obvious fact are chirographic type designers, who want cursiveness to have a power it simply can't. When they ridicule the sloped-Roman, it's not because they have any proof that it's less functional (the proof would show the opposite!), it's because it counters their &quot;faith&quot;. Others favor cursiveness simply because &quot;them's the way me pappy always made 'em&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What we need is some progress. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">My Master's thesis topic was actually extreme form change in multiple master fonts. But to embody that problem, I did an MM that morphed from a Venetian roman to a very cursive italic. So I also studied the difference in the forms a lot, and in some different ways than most people have needed to look at them. I learned lots about the problems (and solutions) of linear interpolation along the way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You did a good job of enumerating the typical differences between roman and italic. Although I agree that the slope is perhaps the single largest factor in visually distinguishing the typical italic from the roman, I don't think it's possible to make a simple formula for the relative contributions of each of the differentiating factors. Indeed, I think that if one was expressing it mathematically, that some of those differences are perhaps multiplicative with each other, or some other more complex relationship. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, I think there's nothing wrong with some cursiveness in an italic. Too much will interfere significantly with readability, but of course if italic is reserved for emphasis, a *little* slowing down is not necessarily bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The part of this where we disagree most strongly is where you bring in all the anti-chirographic screed. It's not that I'm particularly strongly in the chirographic-is-inherently-good camp. But I do think that there is some significant truth to the idea that people are the most comfortable reading fonts that have familiar structure and rhythm. For the Latin script (and many others) that familiar structure and rhythm has a lot to do with the chirographic underpinnings of our printed language. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a country with sufficiently strong centralized control, it would be possible to change this by decree and just do fonts with no chirographic basis. It would just take 50 years or so. Unlike you, I don't think this would necessarily be &quot;progress&quot;; it would just be different.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

You will remember when we were talking about it once we said let's try something not like the usual italic form. This shot is not like the usual italic. It might be called slanted roman. Stanley Morison was advocating something along this line, as better for words in an otherwise roman set-up that wouldn't jump out of the page so much as the usual italic.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;This attempt, as you will see, has roman style serifs, etc., &ndash; idea is to have it color just like its accompanying roman &ndash; same weights and finishing features. &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->June 14, 1932. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;My gag has been &ndash; working along the lines suggested by Stanley Morison &ndash; to make an italic that would be weighted the same as the roman; keeping the texture of the page, and still breaking away from the roman far enough to do the trick that italic is used for. This [Electra Italic] will unquestionably keep the texture pretty, the test will be to see if it separates enough to do the trick.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(It should be noted that the drawings for this italic would have been made by hand &ndash; that is, I don't believe that Dwiggins made use of any photographic manipulation to arrive at his sloped roman.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Griffith, in one of his commentaries, provides this evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the birth of the second italic: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The oblique roman letter, misnamed italic, designed as a running mate with Electra Roman, failed to perform the service that an italic is used for: contrast, emphasis. It was successful, however, in keeping the texture of the page, but so much so that it did not break away far enough to provide a sufficient degree of contrast. Used apart from the roman as an individual face in its own right, this so-called italic possesses essential virtues that make it uniquely appropriate and felicitous for poetry, separatist texts, etc., for its allusive clearness and dignity. . . . <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;With the growth in popularity of Electra as a book text face, the demand became insistent for a more conventional form of italic, particularly the lowercase characters, to provide the necessary break in texture of the printed page. Accordingly, WAD set out to develop a lowercase alphabet in the cursive form which would meet the requirements and at the same time look well in conjunction with oblique style of capitals, numerals, etc., previously made for the original italic.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dwiggins's first attempts in this direction were actually quite bizarre, with some distractingly exotic forms for 'g r s' and an idea for some rather swashy capitals.

System-slanted &quot;faux italics&quot; are usually at 20 degrees I think, while 10 to 12 degrees is typical of real italics.

Now, they're also slightly narrower, but in general the reduction in weight goes just a tad beyond the amount necessary to maintain the same color. FWIW, I'm pretty sure Robert Slimbach agrees with me on this, unless I'm completely misremembering a conversation we had a few weeks ago. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But we're talking a pretty subtle difference in weight, nowhere near the amount one has between one weight and the next in a series.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I think semi-serifs do actually add some cursiveness, because they sort of emulate in/out strokes (and that's the bad news). But my point was something else: you said Prensa's italic was a sloped-Roman except for different structures on four letters; while I think the change from double to semi serifs is significant - in terms of texture, hence contrast. A &quot;true&quot; sloped-Roman (funny) should have full double serifs, no? Or at least a lot more serifs, like in that Deberny face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for dynamism, is it coming from the &quot;seminess&quot; of the serifs, or actually just the slant? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, let me ask something: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How would you compare Prensa's italic with Harrier? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour-latin.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour-latin.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unibody: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's slight.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I actually agree that a darker weight (rarely a full Bold though) is better for emphasis than an italic.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is something that really gets on my tit: if you ask people what italics are used for, one of the typical answers is 'for emphasis' (indeed, the 'em' tag in HTML is interpreted almost exclusively as applying italics: you have to make a different choice explicit in your CSS if you want something other, e.g. bold). But this is often followed by the observation that 'bold is actually better for emphasis'. The problem of both the response regarding the use of italic and the observation regarding bold is that it makes no distinction between <!-- raw HTML omitted -->visual<!-- raw HTML omitted --> emphasis and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->linguistic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->articulatory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> emphasis. The main use of italics within text is for articulatory emphasis, the typographic equivalent of verbal stress. This is completely different from visual emphasis, which unless used to denote shouting has no verbal equivalent: it is usually navigational or indicative of information hierarchy, e.g. to highlight a warning or some other particularly important message in a text. So when you talk about using italic or bold for emphasis, be clear about what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kind<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of emphasis you mean.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; articulatory emphasis &hellip; is completely different from visual emphasis <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Really? The thing is, in 99% of typesetting emphasis is one-dimensional: you choose a style (usually italics) that will make words stand out, irrespective of what they're standing out for, so to speak. And I'm not sure that italics and bold really represent qualitatively different aspects of speech; you could say that an italics of very steep slant &quot;shouts&quot; more than a demi weight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, technically there's no contradiction in saying that &quot;italics are used for emphasis&quot; and &quot;bold makes for better emphasis&quot;. Also, I really haven't heard this second statement often at all - your typical typographer certainly won't agree to that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon, I'm very pleased you like Harrier*. Would you see it being used as a book face?

		<div class="commentbody">I think I agree with John here, in that boldface is used for different kinds of emphasis. I would also add that on average, a bold creates a much heavier emphasis than an italic. Yes, it's possible to design an italic that creates more emphasis (e.g. Galliard), or make weights close enough together that they create less emphasis.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But again, this is not how italics and boldface have generally been designed, nor (as John points out) how they have been used. I'm sure this won't change in my lifetime, and I'm not going to be saddened by this, as I don't feel that we're missing out on some particularly wonderful alternative. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, I was away from Typophile all weekend, and now my mind is reeling from the wealth of discussion here. This'll probably be a long post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firstly, I find it appropriate that Electra comes up in this topic, since I've been a fan of it ever since I discovered it back in school. In fact, it was a large subliminal (and later a direct) inspiration for my first attempt at typeface design. I've always been drawn to lighter faces (a child of the digital age, I suppose), but now I'm starting to find many of them too thin and spindly. In fact, the roman I designed is probably more of an anemic, poorly-fed light face rather than a roman. So, Kent, if you revive Electra, I will be forever in your debt. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Secondly, I'm fascinated by the possibilities of these two variations, to the point that I'd want to incorporate both into any serif design I'd end up doing (I still hold out hope that I'll get to it). Although, I abhor the mathematical 'faux' italics of word processing, so it would be interesting to see where my tastes would lead me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In reference to the emphasis discussion (bold v. italic/ high contrast v. low contrast), I avoid bold weights in text scrupulously, unless forced by 'marketing concerns'. When I post on the web, I'm emulating my speech (which is often sarcastic or ironic), so I use italics for subtle emphasis, and bold for more blunt emphasis. But in printed text, I think I'd use capitals before I'd use bold, solely because of the color difference in the words. I'm not sure where or when I came to this conclusion, but there it is. I reserve bold for heads, typically. I guess this strikes at editorial/ authorial decisions as well. Why use caps for yelling, one could just preface with, &quot;He yelled&hellip;&quot;? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, concerning the sloped v. italic: I would never give up what I consider the rhythmic beauty of a well-matched calligraphic italic in a field of serenely vertical romans. It may not be the most efficient or theoretically sound choice, but I don't think that makes it less effective.* However, the idea of supplementing a family's range of voice with a sloped roman does seem like an intriguing idea (Though I'm treading ground that's already been covered here, I suppose.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps I hold this view for the same reason I wear my great-uncle's manual-winding wristwatch: it's a connection to the past (as Thomas points out) that just feels right&hellip; and still works. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*Interesting side anecdote: I once had to defend the somewhat out-of-context serif italic affectations of Gill Sans italic to a client, who thought they were 'wierd'. I believe they were implying I should faux-italicize instead. Oh, they know not what they do&hellip; Fortunately, I cut that debate short before it got out of hand.</div>

The context (for example, if it's a magazine title, or a single word) will determine what the reader makes of it. My concern is simply to: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Ensure proper saccading. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Avoid a skew in the voice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A typical italic will accomplish the first, but generally fail in the second - it will introduce a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->perceptive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> informality (not just a &quot;shift in tone&quot;) that's not necessarily appropriate (certainly not a newspaper for example). A typical bold will fail in the first (it will cause errant fixations because of its extreme contrast), but succeed in the second. Because failure in the first is more obvious than failure in the second, people will favor italics over bold. But you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have both, with a carefully balanced demi. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Look at the Bold of Mana-16 and see how much better than an italics it works. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; would say that italic is like a change in voice, while <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; bold (or demibold) is like a change in volume.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) I'm not so sure laymen will say this. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) It matters less what they say, versus what they feel. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The purpose of an emphasis style is simply to differentiate, visually.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, but differentiating visually does not necessarily involve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->visually emphasising<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is what happens when you change weight. Such visual emphasis draws immediate attention to the bold words, overriding normal reading, which is the intent: visual emphasis says 'look here'. Articulatory emphasis, using italics, makes a visual distinction, but it is not a distinction of visual emphasis. Italics do not say 'look here', and they do not override normal reading; rather, as you are reading they subtly signal that a word is of a different order to the words around it, either because it is a foreign word or because it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stressed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I disagree that typical italics introduce a 'perceptive informality'. I see nothing informal in the typical italic, e.g. Bembo. If anything, such italics are much more formal (literally, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->formata<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)than sloped romans, which tend to look like toy versions of their upright versions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A 'carefully balanced demi' is still darker than the surrounding text. It is still going to draw the eye to it: even before one starts reading at the top of the page, one is going to be aware of this dark area in the lower peripheral vision. It is still going to say 'look here'</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Such visual emphasis draws immediate attention to the bold words <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not if it's not too dark. An overly-italic italic has the exact same problem that a too-dark bold has. An emphasized word needs to draw a saccade from the correct range: the fixation before it, but not before that. The correct amount of contrast does this, and this is at the perceptive level, way before the reading mechanism has had time to figure out any higher-level information such as what the emphasis is about. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I see nothing informal in the typical italic <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Really? That's strange. So Noordzij is wrong there [too]? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; He will stress the italicised word. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Consciously, sure. But: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) What about the -more important- immersive mechanics? No such thing happens there. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) There's also a rise in amplitude/volume, just like you &quot;accuse&quot; a darker weight of having. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you're assuming too rigid and superficial an interpretation of what actually goes one during reading. For one thing, silent reading is totally removed from articulation. At least let's not regress so many hundreds of years, please. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

In which case, I agree completely. However, as the appointed guide for the reader through the author's text, as long as the rest of the choices support that preference, then my personal preferences and my service to them shouldn't be at odds. I'm willing to accede that there's a relative subtlety in the sloped romans compared to the italics. But the italics click more for me when considering their common usage as an indication of importance, extra considerations, emphasis, emotion, tone, etc. (excluding titles, which is partially what sparked the questions in the first place <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ). This is most likely a moot point, since I tend to use the faces of others, rather than create my own. So, the choice is made for me in most cases. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have both, with a carefully balanced demi. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And a controlled, quality printing environment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; my personal preferences and my service to them shouldn't be at odds. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->must<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be at odds - but &quot;naturally&quot; so - it's a dynamic that can be used well or poorly. Humans can't help being individual and creative - but it's the way you harness that energy which makes the difference between Craft and Art. So for example: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; italics click more for me <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No doubt, and nobody should condemn you for your feelings. But then you have to consider the differences between want and need, between consciousness and the subconscious, and between us and laymen. You have to ask what clicks for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->users<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and if that doesn't click for you then to me that's the real test of a designer: the process of compromise itself should click for you, should turn you on. Otherwise it's merely art. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; And a controlled, quality printing environment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is admittedly a very good point: a demi will get lost in lo-fi printing more than an italic. However: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Lo-fi printing is less demanding in terms of readability anyway. So for example you would use a heavier demi and live with the occasional errant saccade, since they're going to happen a lot anyway. Agreed, this make a demi less desirable in lo-fi printing, but there's still a gain: you're avoiding a skewed voice. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) This still doesn't justify cursiveness in an italic. It's the slope that counts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For one thing, silent reading is totally removed from articulation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are you saying that silent reading is effectively monotonous? I do not think that silent reading is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->totally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> removed from verbal articulation, especially not when one is reading a novel and is dealing with dialogue or articulated narration. But note also that I am not claiming a direct or constant parallel between verbal and typographic articulation. Using italics to indicate foreign words is also typographic articulation, assisting higher level processing of text. I use the term articulation because of the parallels that often do exist and because typographic articulation, like verbal articulation, makes the meaning of language clearer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect we are talking at cross purposes, again, because you are obsessing about what happens in the lowest level of reading comprehension &ndash; word identification &ndash; and I am talking about typographic articulation that exists primarily to assist higher levels of reading comprehension &ndash; textual understanding. Once again, I take readability as a given &ndash; it's not an achievement, it's a prerequisite &ndash;: there's no point to any sophisticated typographic articulation if people can't read. But people can read, and do read, and the goal of their reading is not word identification <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but textual understanding<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Something I forgot to mention: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I actually think that a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lighter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> weight in a body of a slightly darkish font might work even better*. Admittedly this is even rarer than people using a bold/demi for emphasis. In fact the only example I've seen firsthand is Interactive Weak magazine, before the most recent (?) redesign: they used Interstate for some side material and a lighter weight of it for emphasis (although probably more out of necessity than &quot;ideology&quot;). One type designer whose fonts might be very appropriate for such an emphasis technique is Smeijers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* The reason might be that the black in a conventional font takes up less surface than the white. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
