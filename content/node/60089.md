body: "Hi,\r\nDoes anyone know of a Bodoni/Didot style typeface with an 'of' ligature?\r\nI've
  tried searching, but search engines tend to ignore 'of'!\r\nI don't mind something
  in a different style as long as it would fit, maybe something italicised.\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nHenry"

  body: "What would an 'of' ligature look like in a typeface in the style of Bodoni
    or Didot? Since the pair of letters normally doesn't clash and the 'o' in particular
    has no exit stroke of any kind, how do you imagine the ligation? The crossbar
    of the 'f' extending backwards to touch the 'o', perhaps?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oflig_6431.gif]"

  body: "Yes, good point.\r\nI was thinking of something decorative or with a flourish,
    maybe italicised.\r\nI'm working on the following piece of type for a client and
    she's keen to keep the 'of London' in there, but I don't want it to be too prominent
    compared with the name.\r\nCheers,\r\nH\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lollipop-bakery-logo_5510.gif]"

  body: I find the lighter "of London" disconcerting. Too close in weight to the original,
    making it look like an error. Will the client buy changing it to a smaller size,
    perhaps in a different font? I see it fitting as a tag under the baseline of Bakery,
    running up to the descender of the y.
