  body: "David Rakowski's [[http://www.dafont.com/dobkin.font|Dobkin]] Script is actually
    an old German script called \"Hispania\" that looks similar, from the 1880's.
    It would be interesting to know if there was a Spanish script that it was based
    on.\r\n\r\nAnother script from the same page in the \"Treasury of Authentic Art
    Nouveau Alphabets\" book by Ludwig Petzendorfer was a script called \"Zirkularschrift
    Hortensia\", which Canada Type has just released as [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/hortensia/|\"Hortensia\"]].
    It also has some resemblance to your sample, but neither of these is a match.\r\n\r\nThose
    are the most similar fonts I know to the sample you posted, which would make a
    lovely script I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
