  body: My guess is that someone took <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/bold-condensed/testdrive.html?s=Gloves%2Boff%2BHockey&amp;p=48">Aurora
    Bold Condensed</a> and obliqued and stretched it. Bad EAGames, bad!

  body: 'I hadn&#39;t noticed that you&#39;d edited your post -- a very subtle shift
    indeed. <BR> <BR>But we both got it. The way I found it, though, was &#40;at least
    to me&#41; more interesting than usual: it took me a couple of minutes to remember
    where I&#39;d seen the font before, but the old logo of <i>Macworld</i> magazine
    popped into my head. I found the old logo at <a href="http://logo.nino.ru/main/?id=30810&amp;query_id=49477&amp;page=1">logo.nino.ru</a>,
    ran it through WhatTheFont, and got Aurora condensed. From there it was only a
    short hop to Aurora Bold Condensed. This was a fun ID. Thanks, Silver!'

    original drawing to make it ugly! Is it laziness, Dan
