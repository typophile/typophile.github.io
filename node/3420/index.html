		<div class="commentbody">Marc,  <BR> <BR>What offends me most about this article is that it purports to be all you need to design a good logo. A good beginning article should make clear that it is just that, a place to begin. The article fails to cover considerations about reproduction methods, legibility at small and large sizes and fonts in historic context, or indeed let you know that there are any other considerations. A good beginning article might also include a list of logo design books and encourage further study. <BR> <BR>My attempt at humor was based on the vertical type example being labeled &#34;Radical - makes you work to read it; decorative, rebellious.&#34; Sorry, but the word I think of when I see vertical Helvetica is dated. &#40;Sombody please let me know when it becomes retro. OK?&#41; <BR> <BR>And, it may be reality, but do we really think it is a good idea for the marketing person to be designing the company newsletter or updating the Web site? He was talking about fonts, but I agree with Yves in this <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27493.html?1078437075" target="_blank"> post</a> that you get what you pay for. If you want a quality logo, you must be prepared to pay for it. By failing to mention graphic design professionals this article places no value on the years of study and work experience that go into becoming a knowledgeable logo designer.</div>
