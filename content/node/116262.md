  body: "This wide sans with closed counters and an unspurred G eliminates all the
    usual suspects such as Blair, Burin, Sweet, Trio, Engraver's Gothic, Sackers etc.\r\nI
    found a few with matching letter-forms for S and G. Stawix Ruecha's Soin Sans
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stawix/soin-sans-pro/ but it would need to be stretched
    a bit and the counter on C is not open enough. Svetoslav Simov's Intro http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/intro/
    and Code Pro http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/code-pro/ Same problems.\r\nStill
    looking. If it is an unmodified font it's perhaps from one of the foundries that
    do not use Myfonts: Lineto, Klim, Commercial Type etc.\r\nDon"
