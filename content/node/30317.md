body: "<strong>Attention: Type & Design Educators</strong >\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nAre
  you a typography instructor? Is your school planning to offer a typography or type
  design class, or would you like to propose one? Do you teach design but want to
  include type design, usage, and history as well? The Society of Typographic Aficionados
  (SOTA) will be presenting an Education Forum at TypeCon2007, SOTA's annual type
  and typography conference, and we want your input on how to most effectively meet
  your needs.\r\n\r\nPlease take this short survey, and pass it on to anyone else
  who might be interested. It will be available until January 31, 2007. The TypeCon2007
  Education Forum wants to hear from you!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=t8zqj8bab.0.gqirj8bab.pax5yxbab.1691&ts=S0222&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.surveymonkey.com%2Fs.asp%3Fu%3D371153013292\"><strong>Go
