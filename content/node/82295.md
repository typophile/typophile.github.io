  to ne plus ultra. What do you think is the next big 'trend font'? I've seen many
  sans serif based fonts, but am not entirely sure it's a big thing.. Let me know
  what you think.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Isn't it that there are much more type designers out there than ever? I think
    the current trend goes more towards individualism. \r\n\r\nThere are typefaces
    coming up trying to further blur the boundaries between categories. Serifs go
    wedge serif towards slabs. Sans serifs go stressed sans. All these concepts are
    rethought quite often. \"Friendly\" is in, but what is friendly? \r\n\r\nI think
    a really interesting font is the brand new [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100042|Ideal
    Sans]]. A stressed sans that looks extremely balanced. Very harmonic, but not
    too playful to my eye. \r\n\r\nAnother font that defies categories a bit is [[http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/capucine/|Capucine]].
    \r\n\r\nI would bet big fonts are a thing from the past.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetica
    of the 1990s was btw Meta Sans. "

    a typeface family would cost so much that most people couldn't afford a lot of
    choice.\r\nMaybe it was a practical consideration as much as a trend.\r\n\r\nMyFonts
    publish their bestseller lists each year.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/sp/201001.html\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/sp/201101.html\r\n\r\nThere
    seem to be trends driven by new OpenType features \u2013 script faces with loads
    of alternates which the font picks for you to create flowing calligraphy, and
    text faces with lots of ligatures, because there's no longer a practical limit
    on the number of characters a font can have.\r\n\r\nH"

    after Gotham/Obama and Ideal is very saleable. Couple that with their excellent
    website, both information-wise and history-wise, and a decent price tag and you\u2019ve
    got a winner. Other notable rising stars: Alright Sans and Brandon Grotesque. "

  body: "I don't know if \"big\" typefaces are really a thing of the past. After all,
    printing material on paper is still very common - and that's where a lot of effort
    is put into typeface choices, both for advertising and editorial material.\r\n\r\nA
    magazine like Vogue isn't going to download a font off of Dafont or use a 1001
    fonts CD, after all.\r\n\r\nThe market has changed because the number of professional
    typeface designers that are visibly active, independently of major typefoundries,
    is of course much larger now that they can make .TTF files for download instead
    of Monotype matrices and the like.\r\n\r\nBut there are so many very familiar
    typefaces that people are happy with - Times Roman, Optima, Caledonia, Helvetica
    - nothing has come along to make them look \"old-fashioned\", the way it happened
    to Century Expanded (but more so to faces like Modern No. 7) and Caslon. Baskerville
    and Garamond, for example, haven't worn out their welcome.\r\n\r\nStone Sans is
    clearly very popular, though - although there are several other typefaces out
    there that closely resemble it. So much so that there is no clear winner..."
