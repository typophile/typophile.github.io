The Society of Typographic Aficionados is organizing [[http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/|Font Aid V: Made For Japan]], a project uniting the typographic and design communities with a goal of raising funds to expedite relief efforts after the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We hope to be able to complete something akin to the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontaid/coming-together/|Font Aid IV: Coming Together]] typeface, which was created to benefit the victims of the 2010 Haitian earthquake.

<strong>Update!</strong> The project [[http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/|theme and submission guidelines]] have been posted.

<strong>Update!</strong> The typeface now has a name … “Made For Japan”

Thanks in advance for your help.


— Grant

I really like the idea of a cherry blossom motif, provided the fleuron-esque theme doesn’t overlap the [[http://www.beadesigngroup.com/blog/archives/2005/03/fleurons-of-hope.php|Font Aid III: Fleurons of Hope]] project too much. We’d really like to keep each of the Font Aid themes as distinct as possible, giving the contributors an opportunity to create fresh imagery.

<strong>@matt</strong>
The ampersands were incredibly successful for last year’s <strong>Font Aid</strong> project, but we want to push into new visual territory if we can. There is so much Japanese iconography available, even something as simple as the circle. For example, see the work presented on [[http://www.posterpage.ch/exhib/ex278jap/ex278jap.htm|Rene Wanner’s Poster Page]] and [[http://dribbble.com/shots/128815--/rebounds|Dribbble]].

<strong>@anthony</strong>
Would you see contributors creating whatever initial they choose, or does it make sense to limit the characters to a specific set, such as … “J”, “A”, “P”, and “N”, for example?</div>

I think the sakura theme could be pretty distinct as long as contributors are asked to stay away from more traditional 

@riccard0 
Due to a lack of software/OS support emoticons/emoji could be a problem from a technical standpoint if we use the new unicode values. But they could all just be inserted into other slots.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought they simply will be inserted in more common slots (as for the ampersands). More so, since it would be difficult (and maybe even counter-productive) to force each design to target a single different emoticon.
I mentioned the recent adoption by Unicode just because now they’re acknowledged as single glyphs.
Also, since there are still few examples, it would add to the effort a role of inspiration.</div>

We could use the typographic fist to help people!

Designers love using hands in their designs,
so it'd be a very useful font.

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>@riccardo</strong>The idea of riffing on the style of emoji is an very interesting idea. However, I agree with you that we wouldn’t want to try to assigning each participant a specific Unicode glyph to complete. However, there are enough [[http://surf-style.us/manual3.htm|emoji characters]] to go around … the variety of submissions could be quite phenomenal.

<strong>@james</strong> The sakura theme still has me interested as well. It would certainly be a more cohesive set of images. Perhaps if we chose a small set of emoji characters to concentrate on. There are weather, nature, and emotion-related glyphs in the emoji range.</div>

I like the sakura (さくら) theme. In Japan the seasons are distinct and important, so perhaps something seasons related?

It’s Japan! They are so fond of flowers and blossoms, everywhere. And: flowers are a unique symbol for sympathy and hope, people all over the planet like it. It will be a success.
The briefing could ask for glyphs from a single blossom to more elaborate vignettes …

Hand signs always denote certain gestures or expressions. Diffently perceived in various parts of the world. There are culture-sensitive issues involved, that may add pitfalls to the project.

Let us font a passionate bouquet of flowers. Let us all lend one glyph to it, one that surpasses our every-day routines.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Everyone,

as many of my type friends know, I have been greatly influenced by Japan and my time spent there. I have 'adopted' family there and have a very fine thread of connections throughout the country and have spent a lot of sleepless evenings lately trying to connect with everyone there.

I have recoiled from the shock of the emails from friends there and everything I am seeing on tv and online and am finally focused enough to do something. I am setting up a website and method to deliver the most money directly to organizations in Japan. This circumvents international charities and the inefficiencies associated with them. I have been conferring with friends in Japan as to their recommendations of what indigenous organizations there, in Japan, that need help. The first vetted organization is AMDA International (Association of Medical Doctors of Asia) amdainternational.com. I am researching with these same colleagues in Japan on a children's organization that could benefit and we are also in a position to give directly to the prefectures (in the U.S., 'states').

I will be meeting with a bank willing to assist here in the U.S. (to handle wire transfers) and my contacts there in Japan will coordinate with CHUGOKU BANK, TOKYO MITSUBISHI BANK and YUCHO GINKO. My friends and family are primarily located in Takamatsu which is in Kagawa Prefecture on the island of Shikoku (the least negatively impacted island).

The website in process is sogojapan.org which in context, 'sogo' means 'total' or 'whole' or in line with the philosophy of 'sogo-fujo' which sees that humanitarian assistance is not regarded as a single, one-sided occurrence, rather it is seen in a cycle of reciprocating assistance giving a broader perspective of time and scope.

I will be offering a direct line for smaller donations, will be selling a special recut of one of my existing fonts and will try to collaborate with a screenprinting group to print tshirts to sell as well and am waiting to hear back to see if I can get some help with some letterpress options I could put up for sale.

Any monies collected would go through transparent channels and deliver the money DIRECTLY to the Japanese organizations there.

I think I'm still a member of SOTA. I would be happy to help curate this project with anyone and see to it that everyone's time and effort has as much effect as possible for the people of Japan.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great suggestions all! . . . I'm also in favor of either the Flowers/Birds iconography or the Emoji suggestion . . . .

I agree it is appropriate that the font should be based on iconography rather glyphs per se and FYI it should be noted all previous Font Aid fonts, regardless of glyphs were never limited to one unicode, they were simply slugged in all Latin Type 1 slots accessible to the most number of platforms and if there were more than 230 or so, there were multiple fonts created . . .

It should also be noted that quite a lot of the emoji characters rely on colour. They were encoded in Unicode for the benefit of mobile telecom companies, providing them with a standard, efficient way to exchange emoji in text messages, but the expectation is that these would be displayed on devices using colour bitmaps, not TT/OT fonts.</div>

<blockquote>“Japan is a lot more than what we've suggested so far.” — Neil

“How about if everyone makes whatever they want.” — Ray</blockquote>

The number of ideas presented here is extremely encouraging. I don’t want to have this discussion bog down too much, given the time sensitivity of the matter. I believe that Ray and Neil have hit the nail on the head. The contents of the font should be thrown open to include anything relating to Japan — reflecting each contributing designer’s connection to the event, the country, and the culture.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My take on this is that whatever the theme, it should cater to designers who would buy the font not just to contribute to helping Japan, but also to use it. That way we'd be able to raise more money. Keeping that in mind, I like Chank's idea of exclamation mark, or lending a hand. I think a specific theme would raise more funds than people designing anything related to Japan. What do you guys think?

For a different take, keeping it simple: what about a font of @s? 
In the first hours after the event, with phones and other means of communication cut off, internet was the only way to keep in touch. Also, it’s what we’re using to make this project happen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You hear “Emoji” and think “Japan” – well then. 

So, everybody throwing in some arbitrary selection of a few “emoji” glyphs? Having 23 smiling cat faces and 14 hamburgers at the end? How will you manage this?
How is this going to be a useful font?

The pictographic additions of the recent Unicode launch ([[http://typophile.com/node/75120|some explanation here]]) is a rather complex matter, despite being ill-treated by silly terms like “emoji” or “dingbats”.

A collection of 200 birdies or blooms or @s would simply give me a choice to select from a tremendously rich stock if I had to embellish some distinct piece of design.
If I had to do some info graphics I doubt that there is much use for a font where the TRAM is from designer X and the BUS from fellow Y. (But perhaps you think more of smileys and bunnies –?)

This is but my personal view.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wasn’t labelling the pictographic additions to Unicode in toto as “emoji”. Just saying that emoticons where included in it. And that this subset could have been the theme for the font.
And the problem of different styles for each and every glyph is the same for birds, bunnies, flowers, or smileys.
I meant “useful” as in inspirational about how to tackle the design of these new glyphs (one thing you surely have already faced ;-)

That said, anything is good as long as it’s soon.

re: usefulness
It is a charity fundraiser via the typographic community. If the intention is to have ready-made logos for lazy designers, then forget it. 'chindogu' might be a better approach and make the glyphs amazing yet unusable.
 
If it is to do some good, then post the guidelines and let it start.</div>

So I give you the exclamenthesis, perfect for when you need to put something in parentheses and you REALLY mean it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exclamenthesis_4839.jpg]</div>

Sorry for taking so long to get back to this thread. Let’s nip that little issue in the bud.

First of all, thanks to everyone for the discussion and feedback.

Richard, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chindōgu|Chindōgu]] is exactly the concept I’ve had in my head since posting this, I just wasn’t exactly sure how to communicate it. This typeface should contain a stream of creative, emotive, “amazing” — and yet, potentially unusable — glyphs reflective of each designer.

<strong>Font Aid Glyph Submission Guidelines</strong>

Create a glyph that is your own personal interpretation of Japan.

* You may submit up to three glyphs
* Glyphs must be supplied as vector files only (not bitmaps)
* Adobe Illustrator .ai or .eps files are preferred
* Fontlab or Fontographer source files will also be accepted
* Glyphs must be black and white only
* Do not use colour, complex textures, or embedded bitmap images
* Remember, simple is often better

Send the following to <a href="mailto:fontaid@typesociety.org">fontaid@typesociety.org</a> by <strong>March 25th, 2011</strong>

* Final vector artwork file(s)
* A short description of each of your glyphs (optional)
* Your name (as you like it to appear on the project page)
* Your country

Additional information and updates will be posted to the <a href="http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/">Font Aid</a> page on the SOTA website.

Thanks again for everyone’s input.

Now, let’s make an awesome typeface.</div>

Thanks for the great suggestion. We were thinking about the book component of this project. You’re absolutely right … documenting some of the thought process behind each submission would be both interesting and more personal. I have updated the <a href="#comment-455773">submission guidelines</a> with a request for an optional description for each glyph.

I will posting these guidelines and other information on the <a href="http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/">SOTA</a> website as soon as I have access to the server again. The airport wifi in Denver is blocking FTP transfers right now.</div>

Useful? Cool?? Funny???

In this very hour they are sitting down with nothing left. 
And you are fuzzing about a silly bastard glyph, claiming wit for it.
Do you think this will raise funds for the human aid needed?

It’s not my project, but I would consider a revision of the briefing.

I'm positive that everyone who will be involved in this project is well aware of the horrible conditions in Japan. I would also guess that for many of the people involved, their willingness to help will not end with this project. In an effort to raise funds to help the people of Japan, I don't think it's in poor taste to celebrate something uniquely Japanese in a way that's in the spirit of that thing. So yes, I think we should be concerned with making it useful, cool, and funny if being useful, cool, and funny helps raise more money. I think it will.</div>

Ultimately, we are attempting to create is something thoughtful, beautiful, and intriguing. If usefulness (or humour) springs out of the images that are created for Font Aid V, all the better. Remember, we are an extremely talented and empathetic community that can (and will) make wonderful things to help others.

Let’s just focus on that.

The internet tells me that the Noh mask- "Ko-beshimi is used for sorrowful demons." so this seems appropriate, though I've never visited Japan, and I really know nothing of kabuki... I'm not sure if these abstractions of the mask would be seen as offensive in this context, but it is a connotative association for me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't wait to see how this font turns out. I love the idea of everyone doing their own thing for this project. Buyers might prefer it or they might not: we don't know. Next time around, we'll know. I have a feeling this approach is better because it offers something for everyone. Some customers will buy this font and find themselves doing a project where Japanese themed imagery is needed. Some will have a need for manga word balloons. Some will want a lone @ sign. Having a wider variety of glyphs to choose from should make the font more useful. If we would have stuck to variations of one symbol, a customer might use some of them but it's unlikely that they'd use several. Give the customer a variety of glyphs and the chances of those glyphs being used goes up because situations which require their use will be more frequent. The more frequently glyphs are used, the more exposure they get. People who see designs using those glyphs might ask the designer where they got that arrow, noh mask etc. That can end up spreading the idea of Font Aid even further.</div>

Me either.

In additional to the sneak peeks in this thread, there are some gorgeous things being submitted … whether they’re immediately useful or not is a completely subjective matter.

The first glyph combines two Japanese symbols for good fortune. <em>Maneki Neko</em> is a common ceramic sculpture of a cat with an upright paw, often holding a coin, inviting luck. Frogs are also associated with good fortune, especially in travel, perhaps because the word for "frog," <em>kaeru</em>, also means "to return." This frog, assuming the position of the beckoning cat, is a wish for good fortune to return to Japan.

The second glyph combines two vital traditions of Japanese art: the calligraphy of Zen Buddhist painting and the playfulness of contemporary manga comics. The form of the circle, called <em>ensō</em>, is a common, polyvalent symbol appearing in calligraphy. Usually painted in one stroke, the painted <em>ensō</em> is a particular and imperfect expression of the absolute and perfect. This happy <em>ensō</em> has a face inspired by manga in the supercute "<em>chibi</em>" style.

The mask is based on a mask I made for my brother during his semipro wrestling days. They billed him as the shadow something or ninja something, I can't remember. I just remember looking at a lot of Japanese masks and helmet designs. Good, bad or indifferent, this will be the submission for the Fontry. I hope it helps.

I just wanted to let everyone know that your submissions have been received.

We didn’t send out automated responses this year, as I wanted to make sure that I touched base with all participants as the submissions came in. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), our inbox was hit with an overwhelming amount of mail — and I’m still catching up.

I should be finished reviewing all of the files and starting the process of compiling the final OpenType font sometime tomorrow.

We’ll also be sending out an email update to participants this coming week. And as always, the latest information will appear on the [[http://www.typesociety.org/|SOTA website]] and via our [[http://twitter.com/typesociety|Twitter account]].</div>

Very good. With regard to the colors I think, it works best, if either the blue or the red is replaced with white. And not in a square, but with the proportions of the flag. The combination of blue and red is clearer, but it is ugly and extremely aggressive. Much more aggressive than the total contrast of blue and orange in my opinion.</div>

No. Only in Photoshop. (Before I had posted my previous message, I had replaced the colors in Photoshop and I wondered, why it had inverted blue to yellow.)

Red, blue and yellow are the main colors. Although the rgb model (red, green [but not yellow] and blue) works different on the screen, the complementary contrasts are these:

Red/Green
Blue/Orange
Yellow/Violet
Black/White

And yes, when I wrote, that the combination of blue and red is extremely aggressive, I also thought, that a Tsunami is extremely aggressive. But nevertheless it is also beautiful, if you have a look on it from a safe distance. It brings the death, but it is not ugly. In contradiction to that the combination of pure blue and pure red on screen is ugly in most cases, especially if the relation of the areas is so balanced. In case of your image I think, that the color harmony should have priority.

I also dislike the combination of pure blue and pure yellow on screen. Red/blue (neither complementary in the pigment-, nor in the rgb-model), red and its rgb-complementary color (turquoise?) and green/violet are likewise ugly in my opinion.

With the darker blue it works much better.</div>

According to http://colorschemedesigner.com/ the complementary color of #0000ff is #ff<strong>b</strong>f00. How would you call #ffbf00? On my screen it looks like a very decent orange. If I had mixed orange, it had looked more red. (Photoshop inverts #0000ff to #ffff00.)</div>

In the RGB/Additive system; and those are pure Blue and Yellow. But converting to CMYK all kinds of things can happen, depending. BTW whenever you speak of 3×2 hex color codes you're necessarily talking about RGB (although those numbers could have come from a CMYK conversion).

Sure, but I think, that human beings have evolved in an environment, in which they primary have seen light, that was reflected from pigments. But wait, I think, this is no valid argument, because indirect light likewise adds up.  Light with different frequency always adds up and the reflection properties of different pigments always subtract. And the color of (the light reflected from) pigments is partly dependent from the color of the light, that irradiates them. “In the night all cats are black.” This doesn’t mean only, that they look black, but that they are black in the night. So the color of a pigment is a loose property, while their physical properties are very own. That’s a very interesting theme. But we are off topic. We should discuss that in another thread.</div>

Color is one of those creatures that, as Albers so well described, relies on its environment (light and the other colors around it) to "be" what it is. ;-)  You can add the perceptive proclivities of the viewer to that as well.

Hrant's form works quite well in the absence of color and does not change its meaning too radically when color is added.  With all the many possible settings of monitors and human perceptions, I have no idea what Hrant, Arno,  or anyone else is actually seeing.</div>

I think, that I see, what was intended by Hrant:

1. The symbolized rising sun (from the Japanese flag).
2. The sea, which has flooded Japan. There is the shape of Japan coast in the disc. (Well, Hrant, you also could have cutted the disc with the shape of the North coast, since the Tsunami came from the South [or East].)

The Japanese flag is very memorable. If I would see a rectangle with a black disc in it, I would not directly associate Japan, but simply a black disc in a white rectangle. So I can comprehend, why Hrant insists in the red. Why should the flag be suddenly black? Because the Japanese are in teariness? I even don’t know, whether black is the color of distress in Japan. But case it is, there seems to be much more hope than distress in Japan.

So with regard to the reduction to the basics, Hrant’s idea is perfect.</div>

The original idea (which I had waking up one morning - sleep is an amazing thing) was to use the Western coast. But besides making less sense it simply wasn't taking a big enough piece out of the disk/sun. Plus it seemed less like Japan - which brings me to this point: I think using anything less than the full length of the country would have made it almost impossible to see that it's an actual coastal shape; even the way it is, I'm having to tell [most] people. And as I've said before/elsewhere, I'm not a fan of the overly-subtle arrow in the FedEx logo!  :-)

Speaking of black/white: in India white is the color of a funeral.

		<div class="commentbody">Arno, that is exactly what I saw as well.  By presenting the glyph as Hrant has, with no further forms, he has allowed much more flexibility in use for the glyph.  The rising sun was on many thousands of early Japanese artworks even before it became a flag. Japan is one of the few countries that has used a minimalist approach to things to such a degree that you can even say it has become a national trait. Think of the Haiku and the tatami mat and the elegant uses of minimal spaces in architecture seen there. It seems that the Japanese  ask more of their readers than we westerners do. Where many westerners would see an empty space as something that must be filled, the Japanese see it as something to cherish and behold. Perhaps being an Island Nation with no room for outward expansion, they revere unadorned space as something great and difficult to attain.

As for personal differences, I would immediately think of Japan with a black disk in a white rectangle.  I also see the Fedex arrow as so blatant and heavy handed as to seem like a cheap parlor trick.  Such is the difference of both human perception and the effect of our own culture and direct experience.  None of us is wrong in what we see yet each of us is most exactly accurate in what we see for ourselves. If not mistaken, I think that Tibet thinks of Red as a funeral color.  By leaving the glyph unadorned as Hrant has, the person who uses it to speak to an intended audience he is familiar with, has the opportunity to direct properly to that audience even if it confounds the rest of us. If you think of the absolute sense of the metric system compared to the English system of measure, you can not argue with the logic.  Good luck getting US Citizens to adopt it tough ;-)</div>

...which I think is irrelevant? In fact, I would go so far as to say, the farther one goes from a simple literal message, especially over time, cross-culture, and under such tragic circumstances, the less likely one is to have the faintest idea what impact complex symbolic messages might have on the intended audience. </div>

That is what visual communication professionals throughout the World are for.  The glyph Hrant created was like any other glyph in any off-the-shelf font.  The user of the font decides on what to use and how to use it.  The @ sign was never originally intended to stand for today's most common use of it.  Any of the ascii emoticon combinations popular today online are valid fabrications of users yet bear no resemblance to what their individual parts were designed for.  Type designers are the makers of visual tools which can be used or combined with others for use in any way the user sees fit. I would bet that every single normal alphabetical glyph from A to Z started as something far different in meaning than we use today.  "A" no-longer means bulls head.  This is just the ingenuity of humankind putting tools to work.  That is not to say that users will always choose well and that every use will be perfectly understood by everyone. If someone is too lazy to go down to their basement to get a tack hammer and uses their conveniently located cell phone to pound in a tack, the phone maker is not at fault if the fragile device breaks.  The user may well be satisfied with his choice of tool and the fact that the tack is indeed driven as desired no-matter what the rest of the world may think. Sure there can be consequences when unintended damage is done in the process but that does not mean a tool should never have an unintended use.  If there were a mother who happened to be wearing a very expensive silk blouse and uses it as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding of her injured child, would she not be willing to ignore the damage to her blouse in favor of the health of her child?

Yes, the type designer surely has not the faintest idea of what impact individual uses of the glyph might have, but that does not mean a cell phone, silk blouse, tack hammer or automobile should not be created.  Even if the proper tool was selected for brain surgery, it would be a horrible mistake to see it used by someone not highly skilled and capable.

After reading this, I see I have written the classic example of an over-reaction to a harmless comment.--Sorry, David! :-)</div>

<blockquote><p>
It’s been quite a while since you heard from us about the Font Aid V: Made For Japan typeface. We’re sorry about that.

Rest assured, we haven’t forgotten about you. Things have been progressing — slower than we had hoped — but we definitely wanted to let you know what was going on.

The process of integrating the hundreds of glyphs that were submitted has been a massive task. We underestimated both the number of people interested in participating, as well as the sheer amount of work required to get the “Made For Japan” font assembled. There are currently three people working feverishly to put the finishing touches on the typeface, which we hope to have available in early June through several font distributors.

We apologize that there hasn’t been more regular communication about the status of the Font Aid V project. We promise that will change very soon.

Thanks again to everyone who participated and helped us spread the word.</p>

Shame the eventual timing coincides with the start of Movember though. Now there's a thought - a font of moustachioed faces...

Hmm: I've placed my purchase at Veer but it says "download unavailable". Anybody else getting that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here are the numbers. I did a presentation on this at Typecon last summer.

Font Aid 1 raised $2000 for UNICEF 

Font Aid 2 raised $5000 for victims of 9.11 

Font Aid 3 had 3 components. The font itself raised $10,000. An additional $10,000 was raised through a project called Building Letters and another $12,000 was raised from font vendors donating the proceeds from their top selling fonts on MyFonts for 1 month. The money went to help victims of the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

Font Aid 4 raised $13,500 for victims of the earthquake in Haiti.

Can't wait to see Font Aid 5 top these numbers!</div>

And what a road it’s been. Oof.

<blockquote>“Still no sighting of the new Japan version there. Sometimes it takes a while for MyFonts to post it.”</blockquote>

I’m waiting to hear back from MyFonts this week, as well as Ascender/Linotype/Fonts.com … soon, I hope.

<blockquote>“I’ve placed my purchase at Veer but it says ‘download unavailable’. Anybody else getting that?”</blockquote>

There was an initial glitch with the product data when Veer loaded the font into their system. It was corrected swiftly by the goodly Veer crew. Please let me know if you see any other issues and we’ll get them fixed right away.

<blockquote>“Here are the numbers.”</blockquote>

Thanks for posting these, Michelle. I‘m thinking we should add this information to the <a href="http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/">Font Aid</a> background page on the SOTA site.

<blockquote>“Are there plans for a booklet similar to the ampersand version?”</blockquote>

I’d love to do something like this, but I’m swamped. I have been chatting with a designer about doing a poster featuring the entire glyph set, but we’ll have to see. I’m certainly open to suggestions.

Thanks to everyone for being so patient while this project dragged out.</div>

I've noticed on the Veer site that some glyphs seem to have zero advance width. (Type HHHTHHH or HHHSHHH to see examples.) Dunno if it's an error in the font or in the website's type tester.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">S and T have no right side bearing.  The left sidebearing of U is 964 units--I assume that is not intensional. I opened the font in FontLab to check. 

I can understand how typing "STU" in succession would work as combination of 3 glyphs to create a crowd scene but why not do it with either kerning or contextual alternates?  I assume most people who use this font will be rather surprised to find overlaps and huge spaces when they just type one of the 3 glyphs?</div>

That series of glyphs were originally a single glyph, but it had to split up due to the number of nodes. There may have been a different way to approach splitting up the image, but this was the solution that Delve Withrington came up with. If it proves to be an issue for people, we could go back and release an updated font file.</div>
