body: "I've been commissioned for a Shakespeare in the Park logo and poster. For background,
  it's a very well-attended event (last year, I believe, the production drew over
  50,000 people).\r\nFor the logo, I wanted to give it a primarily typographic treatment.
  Initial thoughts went to faces like Temporal, or even Archive Penman Script, but
  I was wondering if any of the great minds here might have a better, or even surprising,
  suggestion before I get started.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=temporal\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=archive+penman\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks

    Sadly, my local Shakespeare in the Park company is now defunct, so I no longer
    get the chance to picnic in front of the thespians, or pitch for their design
    work. \r\n\r\nEric's suggestion is very funny, but perhaps will go straight over
    the heads of the park-strolling masses. \r\n\r\nMy 2\xA2 on the design; concerning
    the logo, one question might be '...is the poster for the play the only context
    the logo will be seen in?' If the logo has to work as a standalone device, then
    the period letterforms approach may be superfluous, because the company's key
    point of difference appears to be the locale of their performances."

  body: "Having recently read <em>Much Ado</em>, I thought I'd chime in. The play
    centers on two couples, Benedick and Beatrice and Claudio and Hero. Benedick and
    Beatrice spar verbally throughout the play for a great deal of comedy, and as
    a result of their friends' trickery, they acknowledge their love for each other
    by the end. While Claudio and Hero also marry at the end, there is a sinister
    element to the plot, as Don John (sort of like a prototype for Iago in <em>Othello</em>)
    schemes to drive them apart. He manages to convince Claudio that Hero has been
    unfaithful, causing him to leave her at the altar. Until Don John is found out,
    the play skirts death and duelling.\r\n\r\nThe most disturbing element to the
    play (if it is emphasized) is the idea that you cannot believe your senses: the
    constant deceptions make what the characters hear and see falsely (\"I have deceived
    even your very eyes\").\r\n\r\nSo, to try to connect this to typography, maybe
    what would speak to the specific character of the play would be a typeface that
    is pleasant and fun but that has, if not an insidious touch, a bit of imperfection
    or mystery. <a href=http://typography.net/type/enigma.htm>Enigma</a> and <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000073#specimen>Delicato</a>
    both have some aspects that draw the eye's attention (just enough), and <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Proforma>Proforma</a>
    in light weights seems to almost shake as if hiding something behind it. Finally,
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/quimera/>Quimera</a>, because of
    its odd weight distribution, looks odd , but you can't quite tell what's weird
    about it."

    of the type arrangement/contrast of forms at the top (if it was me, I'd letterspace
    the capitals a bit and close up the spacing on the italic U&lc title, but I suspect
    this falls into some kind of eggs-sucking category of advice...)\r\n\r\nThe blueness
    in the stage photo is standout \u2013 but below the photo of the scenery, how
    much of that stuff really needs to be there? The daylight slice of the Shakespeare
    Festivals segment is really quite jarring against the artificial nightscape above
    it. As is the red background behind the logos.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance you
    can convince those nice people that the stage photo should be extended to full
    bleed along the bottom edge and that all the logos should be reversed out and
    floated in front of the picture?"

  body: "Well, I appreciate everyone's input. Ben- thanks for the thoughts about the
    title type. Letterspacing the UC was an idea I had, but decided against (maybe
    not a good decision) since it was so small in scale under the script - and red
    to boot - that I chose to take a more straight-forward approach.\r\nAs I said,
    though, the poster (in this incarnation, anyway) will not see the light of day;
    I'm working on other aspects of the pr.  But I did want to get some feedback,
    which has been very valuable to me. Interestingly, I have designed a number of
    posters in the last several years, but almost every one has been a foreign-language
    project. Designing in a language you don't speak well has strange challenges,
    but it does allow you to look at your type as the \"shapes\" as we were taught,
    even without all the \"turn it upside down and squint\" stuff. But working in
    English again (and you can't get much more English than Shakespeare!) has been
    fun."

    Although my study so far is very preliminary, I have learned that Shakespeare
    as far as I know wrote in a "secretary hand" (digital examples <a href=http://www.crazydiamond.co.uk/fonts/sec.html>here</a>
    and <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=SWT0000014>here</a>),
    which is related to the Bastarda blackletter. While at the time people were using
    the italic style that would soon predominate (as seen in the Queen Elizabeth sample),
    it was not what Will used -- although he did often employ an italic long s in
    his signature. James was perfectly correct in suggesting that the humanist handwriting
    might be appropriate for the <em>Much Ado</em> poster (it''s certainly easier
    to read than secretary hand!), but I just wanted to correct this for posterity''s
    sake. '
