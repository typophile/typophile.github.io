<p>What is the difference between condensed and compressed? Are there rules to when and where to use these versions of a font? I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever had the inclination to use these versions, but when I see my friend&rsquo;s work I know it&rsquo;s out of place. I can&rsquo;t really make a good argument for or against his use of these styles.</p>
<p>Can someone enlighten me?</p>

Compressed usually means you&rsquo;ve got some extra weight as well and probably need to use this for display work. So maybe you could generalize that condensed should be legible at smaller sizes, but not compressed.</div>

There are times when they are handy though, like setting in a narrow column or on the front of a can or other cylindrical object.

<p>David Berlow. To name one grand master of designing compressed and condensed fonts. Christian Schwartz, Jonathan Hoefler, Tobias Frere-Jones, and Cyrus Highsmith. Just a short list of people who have designed companion widths for their fonts.</p>
<p>Good point about compressed being good for display. I&rsquo;ve used compressed in display and then condensed for smaller text before and I find that to work well if I want to maintain some sort of continuity of style.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find that the relative character proportions of the normal need to be modified for the other scalings. So characters that are relatively narrow in the normal need to be widened, relatively, in the extended, because one doesn&rsquo;t want narrow-looking characters in an extended style. And vice versa for the condensed.</p>
<p>You can see this principal in Futura:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CE_6697.jpg]</p>
<p>So in general, condensed and extended styles have a greater homogeneity of glyph width than the normal proportion of type.</p>
<p>With the popularity of semi-condensed sans faces, we&rsquo;re seeing more typography with even-width letterforms.</p>

<p>The proportion of the page may have something to do with it, and the constraints of copyfitting in a specific layout. The classic example is the headline that was being left open for a one-column story in a newspaper, on the result of a motor race. The winner was &ldquo;Rickenbacker in a Duesenburg&rdquo; (or something like like that), hence the need for ultra-squished fonts.</p>

<p>I use condensed fonts as headings on a daily basis. They save space and can be really eyecatching, especially those quirky old condensed gothic and grotesque designs. Condensed type can also be a lifeline when designing for writers who simply do not understand concepts like brevity or understatement. For example, Today I used Pill Gothic 300mg to deal with a postcard and a half-page magazine ad that could not contain the text in the 600mg width.</p>
