  body: rename it. If a file has a duplicate name it references the first file with

  body: "Man, that looks so familiar. You're right, it is probably so simple! I used
    to have a card making program that had fonts like First Grader, Second Grader,
    etc. It's kinda hard to tell from the small type, but for some reason this font
    reminds me of the Second Grader font that came with that program. Here's a sample.
    Maybe it will help. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/secondgradersmallcapsbold.jpg]"
