  the designer:</em> \r\nSinder began life as a custom block font that was begging
  to be distressed. Of course it was only an experiment, not to be taken seriously,
  until a customer needed a face of just about these proportions to give his \"paranormal
  investigation\" hobby an appropriately scary image. It was out of necessity, then,
  that I finished the entire font. It never pays to be caught off-guard at a critical
  point in a layout.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONTRY sinder_all_alpha_530_3775.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontry/sinder/
