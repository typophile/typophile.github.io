  life of me remember any titles. Then I happened upon this logo. It's a decal for
  Habitat Skateboards.\r\n\r\nThis particular typeface would be great, but initially
  I was looking for faces in this style used to letter title sequences. Dem's da breaks\u2014
  either one will be splendid. Thanks, folks."

  body: "True. The radii in the B look different\u2014 Rodeo appears to have two foci
    for a flatter bend, and the Habitat logo looks like just one. Could be a customization
    related to making that connection read better with the I."
