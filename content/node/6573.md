  used for this logo? <BR>I&#39;d also be happy with a font that&#39;s pretty similar,
  it doesn&#39;t have to be exactly the same. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48463.jpg"

  body: I can&#39;t find a showing, but here&#39;s an example. <BR>According to Font
    Reserve it&#39;s from Hoefler but I can&#39;t find anything else to support that...

  body: Thanks, that&#39;s exactly the one. <BR>Unfortunately I can&#39;t find it
    anywhere. Does maybe someone have an alternative that comes close? Baucher Gothic
    as suggested above isn&#39;t too bad but maybe there&#39;s better? <BR>Thanks
    anyway for helping!

  body: FB <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/herald-gothic/heraldgothic-medium/testdrive.html?s=HARD+BOILED&amp;p=72">Herald
    Gothic</a> is pretty close, but has even more squarish corners. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    basically a condensed grotesk, of which there are quite a few possibilities. I
    like Pacific Standard. You&#39;ve also got Roswell, which is a little more condensed.

    my hard drive forever &#40;probably passed down from my original Mac Quadra 650&#41;.
    The copyright info says &#34;Panache Graphics&#34; don&#39;t know if they have
    a website, but there are some results for Raleigh Gothic if you search on myfonts.com.<img

  body: That looks the same. Strange about Odeon, I couldn&#39;t find it by Google
    or on the Hoefler web site but my copy says it&#39;s a Hoefler font.

  body: Raleigh Gothic is the original name. It was an ATF face in the hand-set foundry
    type days. Odeon is based on it and I&#39;m fairly sure it was one of Hoefler&#39;s
    early efforts. The Panache version is also the one used for the FontHaus logo.
