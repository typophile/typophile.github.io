body: "Hello Typophilers,\r\n\r\nI want to start exploring the experts opinion on
  the licensing of Outline fonts for PDF embedding.\r\n\r\nA lot of our customer base
  use powerful document composition software that can generate thousands upon thousands
  of either printed documents or documents for viewing, example PDF.  Customer's like
  Utility companies can use the Outline fonts to create financial documents like Bills,
  Statements etc and deliver them electronically to the customer via email or PURL
  rather than mailing in the post.\r\n \r\nNow, as we understand it, the fonts are
  only loaded on up to 5 workstations, and then all of the document development and
  conversion, merging with variable data and conversion to to PDF is done on those.
  \  We also understand that most font foundries allow print and preview embedding
  with their fonts.\r\n \r\nWhat we would like to do is explore the possibility of
  selling commercial PDF embedding licenses to these companies, so that the income
  generated by the sale better reflects their intensive usage of the fonts, rather
  than just selling a standard 5 user license.  We also think there is mileage in
  charging this on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nWe have already approached one of the major
  foundries, who have said they will get back to us, but knowing them they would want
  to take complete control of matters.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing what the experts
  think.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nNeil"

    control of matters, but that\u2019s why you should have an attorney to negotiate
    these kinds of contracts for you. If the numbers come back surprisingly high,
    send out some bids for new typeface commissions to see if that will save you some
    dollars."

  body: "I'm in commercial printing - why would I want to do this?  Pay per use fonts?
    - no thanks. With already licensed fonts that we already own, we make hundreds
    of thousands of variable PDF's daily. Using software like PrintShop Mail for the
    Digimasters and HP's Yours Truly/SmartStream for Indigo presses. \r\n\r\nThe font
    usage if often determined by the designer/artist, so these ppu fonts would have
    to get in the hands of the designer and the cost would have to be passed to the
    customer. I just can't see a customer paying for that when print buying. Just
    my 2 cents from my point of reference."
