  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>What should the &lsquo;Cap Height&rsquo; be on an Ethiopic Glyph? I recognize that putting it that way prejudices the question to some extent especially as there is no lower case in Ethiopic forms and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to force Ethiopic to be Latin-like. However the idea here is to have a font which works well with common sans fonts like Arial. In fact this font will probably be styled somewhere between traiditional ge&rsquo;ez &amp; arial/frutiger/helvetica. In the 1st case we have a height of 616 ( 1000 upm) and in the second we have 716, (the height of caps in Arial). Personally I am favoring the 716. However, the thick thin variation in 616 seems to be a good thing. Please note- The forms themselves are a work in progress as is the spacing. I should also note that this project is not mine. I can&rsquo;t claim the credit. I am just helping out. Examples:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/616_6587.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/717_4942.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Bonus question: Does the greater complexity of ethopic forms as well as their small size as compared to Latin forms mean that spacing needs to be more generous? I am guessing that the answer is yes. Chinese glyphs for example need greater spacing to read well than Latin ones. What do you think?</p>

<p>My own intuition is that the greater complexity of the glyphs calls for a bit more spacing than, say, all-caps Arial, but less than in the examples posted - there&rsquo;s so much white space that it no longers gives the eye a clue. But I think mainly you should pay attention to what sort of spacing the readers expect from proper typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the other hand, if the height vary &amp; the notan or color ( Bill that&rsquo;s for you ) is resultingly more balanced then the spacing can afford to be more Latinesqe. And looking at old examples - thats the model that is traditional too.</p>
<p>What made me wonder about more spacing is that Ato&rsquo;s current vertical Height is semi-regularized (see above) and is creating a greater density and a more varying density than we usually have in latin forms and which I associate with complex chinese glyphs. Hence the idea.</p>
<p>I imagine you could skin the cat that different way: you could treat the glyphs a la the chinese brush to get better notan. That would mean varying the thickness of the strokes and other kinds of notanic compensation that we find in Chinese forms. But I don&rsquo;t think that the best route for Ato. I think the more traditional varying of height makes the most sense especially since he is going to be making a sans Ethiopic face which is perhaps enough of a departure from tradition to start with!</p>
<p>Also, Ato is concerned with screen rendering which is another reason to varry the heights rather than go with the more compressed &lsquo;chinese/latin&rsquo; model. Varying the heights will allow the salient features of the glyphs to remain larger since they are not being compressed to fit a latin cap height at all and so they will be easier to represent in pixels at smaller pt/em sizes.</p>
<p>Moreover Ato&rsquo;s intention is to make a face that mixes well with sans faces such as Arial at the low end &amp; Frutiger at the high. Yet another reason to consider John&rsquo;s Nyala model seriously.</p>
<p>Do you see what I mean? Do you have any counter arguements?</p>
