  type. My router-guy wants it drawn with a monoline font like people use with AutoCAD
  for use with pen plotters. I'm talking about a font that builds letterforms from
  a single vector that goes down the center stroke of the letterforms. \r\n\r\nI'm
  under the impression that Postscript/Opentype/Truetype are not capable of defining
  fonts that are built in that manner. I've googled around and I am pretty sure I
  am correct but I'm wondering if any of y'all can verify. I'm designing in Adobe
  Illustrator. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    path which has had a stroke width applied to it (in Illustrator, or in FontLab
    via the \"Make Parallel Path\" command). You might be able to find a type designer
    who had kept the original working paths, and work from those.\r\n\r\n"

    clients with DXF files to run their routers, exported from CorelDraw. I had to
    wing it with these, since my knowledge of DXF was zilch (and still pretty much
    is), so I drew the letters myself. A lot of my current fonts--at least, those
    designs that are amenable-- are still based on the \"centerline\" method.\r\n\r\nFWIW,
    here's a program which converts TTF fonts to single-line...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sharewareconnection.com/font-2-dxf.htm\r\n\r\nI
    can't vouch for it, but it's an option."

    his molds rather than CNC'ing. I've advocated this because of the higher resolution
    of the laser. The CNC router guy's smallest bit is .050\" and the laser is more
    like .015\" - much nicer. These difficulties with monoline fonts only helps make
    my case that the laser is a better solution. :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Using an older version of Fontographer (4.7 or earlier), you can make such
    as font and generate it in PostScript Type 3 format. No idea whether any applications
    or operating systems still support this format, though. Seems like most or all
    support for Type 3 was dropped by the end of the nineties.

  body: 'Mark - Are you sure it is possible to have a single vector going down the
    stroke of the letterform? Example: a majuscule I when converted to outlines in
    Illustrator would be a single vector, not two parallel lines (well, four if you
    count the top and bottom caps). '

  body: "Type 3 fonts supported almost anything you could do in PostScript, except
    for color and some other things that were added later. This would include stroked
    paths. Letterror's Beowolf font, which randomly moved points around each time
    you printed, is an example of the sort of thing that was possible with Type 3.
    You could even make a \"clip art\" font that included different shades of gray,
    etc.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this format is obsolete, as far as I know. If
    there is still software that supports it, I'm not aware of it. Of course, old
    software still supports it, if you can find it and run it."

  body: "A big problem with stroke fonts is that you need some way to express modulation
    of that stroke, or else you get pretty cruddy results. For example, it's important
    to be able to have thinning where a round stroke meets a separate curved stroke
    (as in the lowercase \"d\"). The reason that there aren't many formats around
    that support them is that unless one makes the format super-complicated, they
    produce rather poor results.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thomas: While you are correct that the results may not look that great without
    modulation, these sorts of fonts are used when there are hardware limitations
    based upon the output device.\r\n\r\nIf you have an old-fashioned pen plotter,
    in most cases you simply can't modulate the stroke. In other situations, you may
    have to physically fetch another tool, and you will have a limited set of tool
    sizes available.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm making printed circuit boards, my CAD software
    uses a font like this. It is not a very pretty font, but it is fine for the kind
    of short single words you use.\r\n\r\nLooking at the other responses here, it
    seems that there isn't a way in Illustrator to do this, am I correct?\r\n\r\nI
    could easily imagine a plug-in or a separate app that generated the outlines and
    let you paste them into Illustrator, but I haven't found one yet."

  body: "Okay, that was fun :-)\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the script I wrote for Illustrator
    CS4 (it might or might not work for any other version): <a href=\"http://www.jongware.com/binaries/monolinetext.v1.0.zip\">monolinetext.v1.0.zip</a>.
    It's a Javascript for Illustrator, and you can put it into the regular Illustrator
    Scripts folder to see it appear in the \"Scripts\" menu, or somewhere else (and
    you'd have to browse for it each time).\r\n\r\nIt shows a little tiny dialog (on
    which I spend <em>most</em> of the time) where you can enter a size in \"points\"
    (relative to the 29 units high Hershey characters) and enter some text. Use Shift+Enter
    to insert a 'Hard Return', or enter as much text as you want. The text is then
    drawn out in monoline characters in the center of the screen.\r\n\r\nThe script
    is intelligent, in that you can change a previously drawn text by simply selecting
    it and running the script. Note, however, that stuff like manual scaling and changed
    attributes (stroke width, color) will be lost. If that's important to you, I might
    look into it ...\r\n\r\nIt only supports a small subset of the Hershey Simplex
    set -- just ASCII, space up to tilde. (And it draws traditional K shapes.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monolinetext_5597.png]"
