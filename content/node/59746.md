body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis caf\xE9 is to be named Caf\xE9 Riva at Inverkip Marina,
  Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe proposed identity is fairly modern that uses graphic interpretations
  of a cup of coffee and yacht sails. You will notice that it uses Avant Garde Gothic
  alternatives. I love them but have never used them in a logo before.\r\n\r\n[[http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept01.jpg]]\r\n\r\nThe
  shop front picture is not the actual caf\xE9, it\u2019s just an example of how it
  could look.  \r\n\r\n[[http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept02.jpg]]\r\n\r\nThis
  identity is still in development and I have other ideas, but felt this one was the
  strongest. I would appreciate any constructive comments please.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    provide more opportunity for discussion. \r\n\r\nInformation regarding their clientele
    (current and desired) would also help. As it stands, I think it's a little to
    close to sailboat than coffee. The blue might be the tipping point.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    you seem to have left out the accent on the \xC9.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, this
    reminds me of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIA_Rail|VIA Rail]] logo but
    I hardly think that's a concern all the way in Scotland. Just an observation.
    If there any old disco fan's that hang out there it might remind them of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boney_M.|Boney
    M]]. They used Avant Garde \"alternates\" a lot in their album art.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    I'm old and I don't go to coffee shops."

  body: "I agree with Christopher above that there's a heavy ocean feel here \u2014
    tropical water, I'd say  \u2014 but that may be intentional. Also, I think the
    blue shapes surrounding the logo are a little much; the first black and white
    version feels much stronger as a mark. It works better on the shop signage and
    the blue line serves well as a graphic element (I really do see that blue line
    as water now) on the menu etc., but I'd perhaps try incorporating the colour scheme
    into that first black and white version."

  body: "I think it depends on what kind of cafe shop that you specifically design
    this logo for it, like the space, the environment, and who is the customer. If
    it is a hip, young, disco, fun cafe shop. I think it would be perfect for it.\r\n\r\nSet
    that aside, I agree with Christ & Collin, it does have ocean feel, blue cool breeze
    water and sail boat. I don't know if it is only just me, but I have hard time
    to read CAFE, it does look like OAFE. \r\n\r\nThe blue line under the text makes
    it look like the ocean with white sailing boat boat float on top. What if you
    reverse the color, blue shape fill in the letter, and white background, no underline.\r\n\r\nI
    think you should put some more different version, so everybody can give you some
    more feedbacks."

  body: The coffee was not really clear to me at first sight. Have you thought about
    using a lighter version of the font (which I think would improve the graphic elements)
    & perhaps giving the 'coffee' a moka colour? That could make a nice colour scheme
    with one of the blues (I'd lose one of them) & help avoid confusion with OAFE.

  body: "Thanks for the detailed comments. Really interesting points. Good to have
    fresh eyes look at this identity.\r\n\r\nI will try out the recommendations and
    post them here.\r\n\r\nInverkip Marina, is one of the largest marinas in the west
    of Scotland not too far from Glasgow. There is a big sailing community based there
    along with related industries. The demographic is fairly affulent and the caf\xE9
    will be based on a busy road. My cousin works at the marina and he thinks the
    caf\xE9 should do well. The caf\xE9 is basically a side line for a yacht repair
    business and will be located at their premises rather than near other shops.\r\n\r\nThe
    caf\xE9 has not been fitted out yet, but it will use modern materials and fittings.\r\n\r\nI
    will post revised concepts shortly.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    word or two words. When Cafe Riva becomes famous, you can use just a symbol for
    a logo, but until then you want instant name recognition. The coffee cup was lost
    on me until you pointed it out.\r\n\r\nIt's so \"arty,\" only artists might patronize
    the place.\r\n\r\n"

  body: From the perspective of a passerby not attuned to type and not directly facing
    the storefront, I would find the sign more effective if its two words were spaced
    farther apart so I could not misread them as one nonsense word, and if the coffee
    cup icon in the C were less abstract, perhaps tilted slightly, to optimize my
    initial comprehension of it from the sidewalk or roadway.

  body: "From a typographic point of view I just dislike the usage of Avant Garde
    at all. Because it is a typeface which violates the very spirit of script without
    gaining *anything* for it. \r\nHowever, I like the colours and the idea with the
    sails is charming. With a more lively, sympathetic typeface, a bit more elegance,
    perhaps a more calligraphic approach you may end up at a really sparkling solution.\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "Thanks the for comments Andreas. Yes, Avant Garde is everywhere and I shouldn't
    have used it but it suited the sail idea quite well. Anyway, the client has deemed
    this solution too modern. So it was back to the drawing board.\r\n\r\nI have now
    proposed a more retro and continental look with subtle nautical references. The
    restaurant will offer Italian style food, coffee, etc.\r\n\r\nThe interior designer
    is proposing a classic American style, with a minimal slightly Shaker feel. No
    clutter, a nice clean look.\r\n\r\nA earlier comment in this thread stated the
    accent was missing from the 'E' in Caf\xE9. This inspired me to make it boat shaped.\r\n\r\nThe
    'E' acts as pier found at marinas. Abstract I know, but most folks should see
    the boat shape at least. Maybe it's too big, I need to play around with it.\r\n\r\nIf
    the client likes the approach I will tweak it and explore more colourways, and
    perhaps typefaces. The figure of 8 knot in the divider line needs more work also.\r\n\r\nYou
    can view the concepts here:\r\nhttp://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva02a.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva02b.jpg\r\n\r\nI

    out more ideas. I liked the idea of combining the saucer with water ripples and
    a graphic interpretation of the sun. The client doesn't want a modern approach,
    so this retro look might be the way forward.\r\n\r\nI might experiment with the
    starburst, colours and other fonts. The first stage of this concept can be viewed

  body: "I feel that your approach is correct, by trying to find something unique
    about the area to incorporate into the logo.\r\nThe directions you've been exploring
    seem to be more fitting of a coffee distribution company, a bit more corporate,
    more refined, and to me they lack personality. I think of a cafe to be inviting,
    somewhere you want to have a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nYou've mentioned that your
    client rejected the first idea, because it was too modern. Although, maybe you
    should revisit that idea. Ask yourself what would that logo look like if it took
    on a different personality. Use that logo as a starting point and move away from
    it, change the colors, thin out the line, strip away the pieces, take them apart,
    and then reassemble them. Think of those elements as your palette. \r\n\r\nRegarding
    color, blue isn't a color closely associated with food and drink. It does not
    inspire people to eat. Research has shown that blue decreases one's appetite.\r\n\r\nI
    also agree with \"aluminum\" \u2014using the logotype on the bathroom doors is
    diluting the strength of the identity. You wouldn't want to brand bathroom doors
    with the same emphasis as the logo that's representing food product."
