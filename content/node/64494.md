  body: Interesting shapes. Illegible though. Not very useful in my opinion except
    to make interesting textures and patterns. Of course everything depends on what
    you're trying to communicate.

  body: My opinion still hasn't changed - the font is still nearly illegible. It could
    prove useful by using the letter shapes to create texture and pattern in a design
    - but that means the font is acting less as a typeface and rather more as a design
    element. Again, everything (including usefulness) depends on what you're trying
    to communicate.
