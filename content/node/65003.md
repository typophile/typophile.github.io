  body: "Monogram initials are almost always from special fonts, because vertical
    ornate initials are just not normally in script fonts. Did you look at Harold
    Lohner's monogram fonts? (also found at Font Bros). I am using a computer with
    a dead mouse, so I can't easily connect links -- sorry.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    is a specialized monogram font, though. The fit 'n' finish seems a bit unpolished.\r\n\r\nMarc"
