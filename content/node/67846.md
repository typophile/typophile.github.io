body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've lurked here for a looong time and finally decided to set-up
  my account. I'm looking for fonts that have round O's and \"stiff\" capitals as
  seen in the logo of http://www.fhoke.com. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logoFhoke_5531.gif]\r\n\r\nI've
  been scouring my small collection and MyFonts for a bit and I can't seem to find
  any. Suggestions? Thanks! FF \r\n\r\nP.S I know the correct term is not \"stiff\",
  what kind of font is that considered?"

    Bold]], with the F and E customized.\r\n\r\nIs 'geometric' the term you are looking
    for?"

    or Mark Simonson's Mostra Nuova\r\nhttp://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostranuova.html\r\n\r\nFor
    a nod to the 60s/70s, try Avant Garde or its slab-serif sibling, Lubalin Graph:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/avant+garde/fonts/\r\n\r\n...or
    search MyFonts or FontShop for \"geometric.\" "
