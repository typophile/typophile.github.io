  body: 'Ole: I like! The letterforms are very illustrative. The &#34;A&#34; reminds
    me of a sumo wrestler and the &#34;M&#34; looks like a Japanese arch. The i is
    a little dull compared to the other letters. And the bottom stroke of the G seems
    a little flat and the connection is awkward. How would it look if the G had a
    vertical bar sort of like the horizontal double bars of the H and K? Also, did
    you intend for some strokes to be slightly thinner than others? Perhaps it is
    just the screen. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21463.gif"

  body: Hi Ole. Enjoyable letterforms. Nice work. <BR> <BR>I wonder how it would look
    without the lines underneath?
