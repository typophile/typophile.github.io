body: "I am currently wanting to do an editorial piece, but in a typographic form.
  I am having problems with the subject to base it on. I have thought of the following
  themes I thought would help using experimental typographic layouts.\r\n\r\n* Conversations
  on something controversial\r\n* Art movements\r\n* The word 'black'\r\n* The word
  '1st'\r\n* Film posters but typographically\r\n* The letter G \r\n* Funny useless
  facts\r\n* Fonts (but developing a humorous story behind them all and creating pretentious
  character etc)\r\n* Numbers\r\n\r\nI'm having problems. It's making me crazy. Any
  feedback and advice welcome. Thanks."

    you've chosen your subject, and not asking for advice on editorial content?\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure you could make an excellent piece from any one of those topics, but I think
    you ought to be the one to choose it.\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: "Tell something about your experimental layout ideas.\r\nFonts, fonts, fonts?\r\nPositioning/reversing/upsidedowning?\r\nColouring?\r\nSizing?\r\nAll
    of the above?\r\n\r\nWith some effort, I could write a short about just any of
    your subjects. Making it typographically appealing (or appalling) takes some lateral
    thought. I think I would do the actual writing of text in a layout program (perhaps
    even Illustrator), so I could mix in the typography \"live\" whenever I want."

    on the typography of posters, perhaps use the grid or layout from the poster to
    form the basis of the text concerning it.\r\nGood luck."

    I'mm choosing a topic before I think of type.\r\nWill: Good idea. I shall keep
    that in mind.\r\nJames: How do you mean by 'blaxploitation'? Would that some how
    link in with expressing with type and letterforms?"

  body: "Can someone please help me? If i was to do an editorial piece using experimental
    typography, what theme would appeal most for that type of work from the following?\r\n\r\n*
    An A-Z of me and my personality, work and attitude. The phrases I use etc\r\n*
    Conversations on controversial issues\r\n* On the word '1st/First' so spreads
    on the 1st beginnings, 1st day at school, No 1 etc\r\n\r\nWhich do you think has
    more scope? I need to choose 1 out of 3 above. What would you advise? Thanks"

  body: "Probably not the second one, I'd say its of a lesser typographic relevance
    than the other two.\r\n\r\nId' probably choose the A-Z one, you would enjoy it
    more.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd one seems very broad. \r\n\r\nI think with type its better
    to be specific. Go with No. 1..\r\n\r\nUp to you tho ha.."

  body: Yes, I've gone with the number 1, only because it's safe for me at this moment
    in time having 7 weeks to do this project and possibly posters etc. I'm doing
    an editorial piece of the work and making it into book but I have no clue how
    to decide on what size to work on. How do I choose? Please help. I've thought
    of making the book into a number 1 shape but it won't give me enough space to
    work with my words and image...or will it? Hmm...any ideas? All feedback welcome.

    like a magazine."

  body: I shall. I WAS doing conversations as my main theme but i was told it was
    too vast. Oh well...I decided on doing it on number 1, First instead. It's proving
    difficult to come up with clever editorial. I know I am able to perform well  doing
    editorial, but a clever piece...oh no. It's hard.
