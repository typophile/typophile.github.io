		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I think I read somewhere that no one has yet purchased Luxury, because everyone seems to think it's an elaborate joke (it's not). I agree with BJ, though: the high price alone gives it the exclusivity one would associate with &quot;luxury&quot; &ndash; so it is kind of a postmodern joke after all, in addition to being (IMO) a valid price for some nice design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Keith, maybe I am thinking the wrong way about this, but it seems to me only fashion advertisers will want to use 'Luxury', and they will have the money and want the exclusivity. <BR> <BR>But with Trinite, an amazing text face, the whole world might want it, like Times New Roman. By the way, Lexicon, which TEFF compares to Times New Roman as far as versatility, and which Tiffany wants, is also priced similarly in the stratosphere.  <BR> <BR>If TEFF could sell thousands more of Lexicon or Trinite by lowering the price, it would make sense to do so. (Of course I don't actually know the 'price elasticity,' as the economists put it, for these typefaces.) For 'Luxury,' as a display face with a wonderful but very limited appeal, you're not going to sell thousands anyway. <BR> <BR>The rational basis for pricing is not the work that goes into it, but what will gross the most for the product given the market. Of course that might influence your willingness to do the work in the first place&hellip;</div>

More people are willing to pay for display faces but not 'invisible' text faces. Lexicon is a great typeface, but how many (graphic) designers know or even care about that?

		<div class="commentbody">But BJ, the point is that Luxury is <i>not</i> a custom typeface and the price tag doesn't guarantee exclusivity. <BR> <BR>I think the pricing puts Luxury in a kind of no man's land. You can't afford to buy it for a one-time use. But it's not the kind of face you'd use over and over again. You should'nt want to anyway. <BR> <BR>And clients who can afford it will think twice about spending so much on a retail face. They might even be willing to pay slightly more to get a customised face.  <BR> <BR>Btw, does anyone have any idea how much a customised face would cost? The LTA one by <a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de/" target="_blank">Hubert Jocham</a> for instance. Really curious.  <BR> <BR>Also, What are the factors that affect the pricing of a custom face?</div>

The Lexicon seemed to me too black, but I might have a different opinion if I could read it.  <BR> <BR>Trinite has so many versions (three different extender heights, two widths, et al.), that it would really take more settings of the different sizes to get a concept. The text setting I was sent - a setting in the tallest and widest version - was beautiful, but this is probably not the most practical size for book text. A lengthy PDF with different settings of the variations in a language I could read would be of great help in judging. But honestly, the price is prohibitive in any case.    <BR> <BR>Given what you and Hrant say about the scarcity of their stuff here, I wonder if they have they (and DTL) have priced themselves out of the US market. They may be geniuses in marketing as they are in type design, but it doesn't look that way from where I sit.   <BR> <BR>Oh, I read on Typographica that a book on Bram de Does has just come out, so maybe I can get that or access to it eventually.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, if you can sell one font family license for $3000 rather than seven font family licenses for $400 each, why would you consider this bad marketing, especially if the service overhead for each license is the same? Given the extent of font piracy in the larger market, there is something to be said for high prices and a limited market: among other things, you can be pretty certain that TEFF has a very different relationship with its customers than Adobe has. Likewise Gerard Unger, and also some American type designers such as Sumner Stone. Interesting to note that Sumner used to work for Adobe, so he knows both sides of the font pricing question. If you buy a font from the Stone Foundry, you not only pay a lot more than you would for an Adobe font, you also have to <i>sign</i> a license contract. Such things reinforce the value of what is being purchased. <BR> <BR>I don't think either approach is <i>bad</i> marketing. They are different approaches to different markets. There are people who are willing to pay a premium for quality fonts and who understand that one of the things they are paying for is relative exclusivity: they want fonts that not every Tom, Dick and Harriet graphic designer has on his or her hard drive. <BR> <BR>Are you saying that it is bad marketing for Emiglio Zegna to price their clothes so that the Walmart shoppers can't afford them? <BR> <BR>And how do you measure the success of a small foundry like TEFF? Peter Matthias and his colleagues feed, clothe and house themselves and their families. Is it also necessary for a small foundry to become a big foundry? Or to enslave itself to shareholders and the constant drive for higher and higher profits?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eduardo, I don't see the difference in the 'A's. What is the difference? (I am talking about the ALDO logo not the flash animation, which I guess has some light Helvetica.)  <BR> <BR>John, I agree that both approaches can make sense, or not. It just depends on the market - or, to use economists language, on the price elasticity for the good in question.   <BR> <BR>I also can easily believe an alternative theory: that the TEFF and DTL people make their livelihood mainly from teaching and commissioned work, and that the foundries are sidelines. And that they are too busy with other stuff to market properly.  <BR> <BR>(Evidence: DTL has been promising that van Krimpen's Romulus, which I adore, would be out in three months, for about three years. The current 'deadline' is August 2003; it has been changed four times, I think. They are also selling FontMaster, which seems to be a higher priority.) <BR> <BR>Being an abominable marketer myself, I would be the last to say this weakness puts the good folks at these places in a bad light.  <BR> <BR>You may be right that they are following an optimal path for marketing. But I tend to believe my eyes. I don't see their faces here, and the work is great stuff, according to many on these boards, as well as amateur me. To me that raises a real question mark.  <BR> <BR>As to Hrant's reasonable question why they should succeed there and not here: it is different selling to their countrymen, who will buy out of friendship and national loyalty in a small country.  <BR> <BR>I'm definitely not saying I know better. And I learned from a similar discussion on Typographica that eg. different car models price for different niches. But I am saying that the evidence makes me question whether charging ten times more really is an economic benefit to them.  <BR> <BR>In this thread people are questioning Christian Schwartz's decision on 'Luxury', and defending DTL and TEFF. My intuition is that it is the other way around. I've been wrong before, lots, but I notice that sometimes when that little bell goes off sometimes I'm right too.</div>

The Luxury Collection is our attempt to comment on the fact that the multitude of high-fashion logos can be boiled down into three fonts. &quot;fashionable&quot; things look a very specific way, and consumers allow them to be priced accordingly. we were hoping the ridiculous price would clue people in on the fact that the set is a joke. (the thought of someone paying $1500 for these three fonts, now that's funny!)  <BR> <BR>is there a place for social commentary and satire in type design? is the idea of a type family as conceptual art too much of a stretch? or is the problem that we were too straight-faced with our execution? because in this case, i think the attitude IS the function. <BR> <BR>in any case, we were planning for this set to be more of a publicity stunt than a product that sold a whole lot of copies. and it looks like that part, at least, is working out pretty well.&lt;!-/quote-!&gt;<hr size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR></p>
