    really do not know much about this sort of thing so I wouldn't be able to assess

  body: "Day is fine, thanks. I did a quick search on eBay yesterday and found some
    old letterpress type but the search needs to be refined to exclude stuff that's
    irrelevant which is why I didn't initially attach the link.\r\n\r\neBay is my
    go-to for mildly obscure stuff. I've also seen stuff like this at flea markets
    and antique stores but since you're in Melbourne I can't help you there."

  body: "I got my 48 size of Pascal from eBay. Not in the best shape, but a really
    good deal. On the other hand, much metal type on eBay is junk. There's this one
    guy who sells the sorts heaped in plastic bags... What you might want to ask for
    is: a macro photo of a bunch of sorts, to check for wear and crud; an explanation
    of how it's packaged, especially for shipping; and an explanation of character
    coverage, like alphabetics, numerals, ligatures, etc. (and a guarantee of no missing
    characters). Even if you'll never print from the font, I think it's a matter of
    decency to not buy the equivalent of a ratty prostitute with missing teeth. Some
    sellers won't go to the trouble of all this, but of course these tend to be the
    ones with suspect goods - only worth paying a few dollars to try your luck.\r\n\r\nPaul,
    if you ever get your hands on metal type <cite>in a drawer</cite> please make
    sure to contact me - I have something interesting cooking - in fact it's ready
    to serve, it just needs a nice web page.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
