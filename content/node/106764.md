body: "Hi, I am a research scholar and am currently working with a designer and a
  publisher on my first academic publication. My question concerns the two fonts used
  on the cover title \u2013 DIN-Bold and DIN-Light. The problem is, I don\u2019t know
  much about font licensing, but want to be on the right side of the law. I have realized
  that both my publisher and my designer are reluctant to buy the font licenses themselves,
  so it is now up to me to do the right thing. My designer asked me that I will have
  to acquire the license online. I tried to find the font, but there are several different
  DIN fonts around the web. I can\u2019t figure out which of the many DIN fonts available
  online are these 2 particular fonts. When I asked my designer to be specific about
  them, they replied, the font files are named \"DINB___.ttf\" and \"DINL___.ttf\",
  and the info says: \u201CFont Name: DIN-Bold; Version: Altsys Metamorphosis:6/5/02;
  TrueType Outlines.\u201D Which confused me further. Can anybody guide me to the
  link of the specific font one needs to buy to fix this? I have found some websites
  which are offering \u201CDINB___\u201D and \u201CDINL___\u201D fonts to be downloaded
  for free; does it mean these are free fonts? But I can\u2019t find a website which
  offer licensing for these 2 specific fonts...?! :(\r\n\r\nMy second question is:
  who is responsible for a font used in the cover title anyway \u2013 the designer,
  the publisher or the author? Something tells me its not the author's responsibility,
  but I might be wrong...? :) Thanks!\r\n\r\nReshma\r\n"

  body: "The only official DIN Light (& Bold) font I know of is this:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/din\r\n\r\n\xABDIN
    Pro Light\xBB is the most current version of these fonts. Older versions (PostScript
    Type 1 or TrueType) have been called just \xABDIN Light\xBB.\r\n\r\nThe \xABAltsys
    Metamorphosis\xBB info entry was probably added by a conversion tool when those
    fonts were (unofficially) converted to TrueType.\r\n\r\n(The DIN family from FontFont
    is based on the German DIN 1451 standard, the design of which was made by engineers
    and never included a light weight. That\u2019s why I think you are looking at
    some version of FF DIN here. There is also DIN Next by Linotype, which is not
    identical, it has a light weight, but its name always included the \xABNext\xBB
    suffix.)"

  body: "Okay, great! First off, thanks a lot, both of you!\r\n\r\n@Jens Kutilek -
    I'm sorry, but this got even more complicated for me. You mean this font is an
    \"unofficial\" version? What are the legal implications of using that, then? Do
    you think buying the license for the \"official version\" from the link you posted
    will solve my problem then? I'm sorry, I might be asking really daft questions,
    but I have no idea whatsoever how it is done!! Thanks :)"

  body: "In this case the designer is most probably the person who needs to license
    the fonts, as the designer is the person actually using the fonts. But if you
    are asking the designer to supply you with the designer\u2019s original files
    (as opposed to the designer supplying you with a PDF file with the fonts embedded),
    then in that case you both need to license the fonts.\r\n\r\nAn interesting question
    is just where the designer got these converted TrueType fonts, if he or she didn\u2019t
    license the originals.\r\n"

  body: "Actually, every person who has the font on their machine as font software
    is suppose to have the license. Additionally, the EULA (End User Licensing Agreement)
    may stipulate that the font cannot be embedded in a PDF file, or not so embedded
    without an additional licensing fee, which would mean the \"ink\" printer (if
    there is one) would also need to have a license. There may be further licensing
    fees if the book is to be distributed in digital form as a PDF.\r\n\r\nEULA's
    vary widely across the many publishers of fonts. And some largish companies in
    Europe are seeing a potential gold mine in font licensing. That they are thinking
    more of commercial advertising than academic use is unfortunate, but there you
    are.\r\n\r\nI'd say your designer is treating you rather shabbily, though of course,
    that is a quick reaction by someone in the states (who works in scholarly publishing),
    and may be unfair in this particular case.\r\n\r\nIf the publisher and designer
    are asking you, the author, to bear all font licensing costs, I'd seriously suggest
    that you consider OpenSource fonts, which typically have no cost, and no restrictions.\r\n\r\nHere
    is one such:\r\n\r\nhttp://openfontlibrary.org/font/osp-din\r\n\r\nHere are a
    couple more:\r\n\r\nhttp://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/7178/din-font-free-alternative\r\n\r\nThis
    is exactly where designer should be helping you, rather than simply being an artist
    & then claiming the cost is your problem. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nWhile not DIN,
    Lato is a good, OpenSource font Here's a couple links:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latofonts.com/\r\nhttp://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato\r\n\r\nFor
    your amusement & education, you might enjoy the Wikipedia entry on DIN fonts...\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451\r\n\r\nNote
    that at the bottom of the article in Wikipedia, there *seem* to be a couple downloads
    of DIN as OpenSource..."

  body: "Wow, thank you everybody! I'm really grateful for all the suggestions!\r\n@charles
    ellertson - These are great alternatives. And now I am gradually getting the hang
    of it all :) We tend to take things like fonts etc. for granted, but now I know
    better! Thanks again for the detailed response. I might just end up buying the
    original version and have the fake one replaced, because I have really come to
    like the look of this font: it's both very academic and stylish. \r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot, once again!!!  "

    necessarily mean \"illegal\". Some licenses allow or used to allow format conversion
    or modifications for your internal use.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>EULA's vary widely
    across the many publishers of fonts. And some largish companies in Europe are

    you FontFont isn\u2019t one of those. The standard license covers PDF embedding
    for print and digital distribution (PDF, epub3 ...). (Though it doesn\u2019t allow
    modification of the fonts, and for embedding in apps or editable documents a different
    license is required.)"
