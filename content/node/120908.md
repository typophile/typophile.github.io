    (phillipedada) in the Myfonts forum (May, 2005):\r\n---start quote---\r\nDon Munson,
    former Art Director of Ballantine Books, NYC -- designed MGB Patrician. (The initials
    I believe were for him, his wife and partner, the Patrician for his daughter)
    At first it was a typositor exclusive at Haber. They would bill out 2 dollars
    a letter for each letter they set. Eventually, it was turned over to Letraset
    and made a rub on transfer - with those great alternative \"S\"s...\r\nMr. Munson
    left his job - Haber\u2019s shop moved into Image\u2019s shop - and old man Haber,
    left the office one night - took 4 steps outside the door, had a heart attack,
    and was found dead on the floor later that night....\r\n-- end quote --\r\nThere
    are various digital versions under various names.\r\nUPDATE:\r\nMGB Patrician
    was published in the Letraset Product Manual with credit to MGB Communications
    Ltd.\r\nDon"
