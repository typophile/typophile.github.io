  any prior participation. I hope to be able to join in the fun from here onwards
  though, however for now I'm trying to find a font used in a friends website, I'm
  making an attempt at neatening up the design as as a surprise, and I'd like to keep
  a font they used, but @include it in a website. \r\n\r\nDon't mind if it's commercial,
  although if it's super premium a Typekit hosted analog might be useful. I know from
  reading that you folks  care about your lively hoods : )\r\n\r\nIt's in an image,
  so hopefully that;s where you folks come in.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure what it's classed
  as, possibly a sans serif, would probably be filed under the 'display' section of
  a foundry. Open to learning along the way.  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unknownfont_4186.png]"

  body: 'Update for the curious, just came across Fredoka One by Milena Branda on
    google fonts, it;s pretty dang close but the M is not quite right, it''s a bit
    harder. The M above looks more like a modded W from from Fredoka, it''s possible
    they played around a bit... still you guys are the experts  '

  body: "So true. Designers love to tweek a font a tiny bit to show they have done
    WORK on a logo:)\r\nBut I do suspect that some of the rounded/soft matches do
    have this apostrophe. I checked the Proxima Nova Soft charset and it has the correct
    apostrophe. Unfortunately it is not as good a match as VAG Rounded or Vega.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Albert Jan Pool. VAG LT was so spot on, except for the apostrophe,
    I should have checked the alternative BT digitization. \r\nAh well, the English
    language, home of the apostrophe, censored and banned on signs in some jurisdictions
    with protective language laws, and omitted from possessives in other languages

  body: "Vega is the Scangraphic clone of VAG Rundschrift / VAG Rounded. If we may
    believe [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedley_Place|the english Wikipedia]] on
    this, VAG Rundschrift / Rounded was designed by Gerry Barney at the agency Sedley
    Place in 1979. The [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAG_Rundschrift|german Wikipedia]]
    tells a different story though. They date the design 1978 and attribute the design
    to Wolf Rogosky and Gerd Hiepler with later adaptations by Bertel Schmitt and
    Manfred Schwarzer. \r\n\r\nThe apostrophe in the Bitstream version used by Michel
    Boyer and in the MacGregor\u2019s Market logotype differs from the version available
    from URW, E+F, Adobe and Linotype. In my eyes and because older Bitstream data
    usually has origins at Linotype, the design of the Bitstream apostrophe is probably
    what the Germans call a \u2018Verschlimmbesserung\u2019, which roughly might translate
    into something like \u2018inappropriavement\u2019."
