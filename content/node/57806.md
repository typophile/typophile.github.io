body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI drew some Serif like characters that will hope to result in a
  new font. It's my first Serif project, and of course it's far away from done.\r\nOpen
  the attachment to see the characters I've made till now.\r\nEverything drawn in
  PowerPoint. xD\r\nWell, I like the \"a\" and the name of the font.\r\n\r\nNote again,
  I'm 15 and haven't yet any type designing lessons. :')\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn
