body: "Workhorse is a Sign Painter's Gothic developed by Master Sign Painter Greg
  Reid. Workhorse captures the true essence of hand lettering. From the tapered waists
  to the elegant snaps of the brush; these elements present a warmth unseen in today's
  mechanically stiff Gothics. Greg Reid and Charles Borges de Oliveira collaborated
  to bring this truly one of a kind typeface to fruition. With the power of Open type,
  Workhorse utilizes Contextual Alternates to create random variations of the capitals
  and lowercase letters. This allows your text to have subtle differences in the letters
  without losing form which helps to create an honest hand lettered look. This feature
  can be turned on or off to suit your individual style. You also have the ability
  to manually choose the glyph variations from the glyph pallet to help you create
  one of kind designs. Both versions of Workhorse feature complete variations of the
  capitals and lowercase letters (56 total), Small Caps and six alternates. The Small
  Caps are not just the capitals scaled down. They have been designed as a unique
  second set that adjusts the stroke thickness to match the existing letters, creating
  what we like to refer to as \"Real Small Caps\". Workhorse is a timeless classic
  that can be used from early Americana advertising all the way up to present day
  modern use.\r\n No matter how you use Workhorse it always looks and reads well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Petersons-Bread_5407.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hill-Top-Apple2_3820.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Workhorse-menu_3527.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Workhorse-Small-Caps3_4341.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Workhorse-CA2_5042.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Workhorse-Rough_3524.png]\r\nAvailable
