  airport bookstore in Toronto Pearson I counted 12 books using [[Clarendon]] the
  covers.\r\n\r\nI guess it's pretty officially overused now."

    book covers on its site, it would be possible to extract font info and produce
    statistically meaningful results.\r\nAscender Corp did a survey of news faces
    in such a manner, at Newseum.org"

  body: "In the early 70s I worked at Charrette, the big art supply store in Cambridge
    and Boston. In the late 60s and early 70s they still serviced mostly architects.
    At that time we were the biggest dealer of Letraset in the world. \r\n\r\nThe
    reason I bring this up is that Clarendon was a huge favorite with architects and
    so was Helvetica. Both were early mainstays in Letraset's line. So in the same
    way that the Laserwriter font set made Palatino far more prominent than it might
    have been otherwise, I think Letraset had a lot to do with the heavy usage of
    Clarendon among architects, at least back then. \r\n\r\n(Now that press-on lettering
    is a fossil from the past, I doubt they use Clarendon much anymore -- they've
    undoubtedly migrated to Comic Sans.)"

    does not show up here anywhere else.  Don't tell me it's becoming the \"trendy\"
    face....  <em>blech</em>\r\n\r\nBenguiat, OTOH, is everywhere: there's a block
    that's being bulldozed here in Calgary (kitty-corner from where <em>Helvetica</em>
    is showing May 8) and the bar at the far corner has all their Gaelic woo-haa in
    foot-high brass Benguiat all-caps. \r\n\r\nI'm so glad the place is getting torn
    down soon."
