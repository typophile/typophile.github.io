Topic: "KERNING"
Clarification: I do not mean to large text or entire paragraphs, I mean words of 3 to 10 characters maximum (eg logo)

I try to find a professional technique or a good technique to help me put a good KERNING.

I know there is KERNING button on Ps and Ai, but for what I need I think it would be more correct and professional do otherwise.

I know pages as Myfonts and FontShop among many others, and I realized that in these pages is has a default KERNING system that apparently is very well placed on purpose.

For example when writing the word YELLOW in Ai and place the button OPTIC KERNING the result is very different from writing the word YELLOW at MyFonts, the KERNING is very different this much better placed in Myfonts.

The problem is that not all sources are in Myfonts or those familiar pages.

Can anyone help me with a technique or method to place an excellent KERNING? (read second paragraph please)

I would appreciate infinitely.

		<div class="commentbody">Metric kerning relies on a typeface’s internal metric data, as determined by the typeface designer, to space letters. Optical kerning adjusts spacing based on general letter shapes. Here’s a good discussion of the two with examples, plus links to references:
http://type-ed.com/2013/12/08/metrics-vs-optical/

Also, I found Jan Tschichold’s <cite>Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering</cite> (1932) to be a useful resource for  understanding how kerning should work; his examples of uppercase and lowercase kerning are fairly straightforward. The basic principles still apply to digital type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">RE: AzizMostafa ...  Arabic? no no, this is for  Sans, Sans Serif, Displays fonts, headers texts. (words of 3 to 10 characters maximum (eg logo))

RE: kthomps5 ...  The secluded provides a good explanation, gives his point of view, and causes us to provide our own discretion, but ... does not explain any independent technique to the OPTIK-KERNING button.

A clear example that caught my attention is the logo of typophile (sans), can opservar the KERNING is very good, in fact I think it was done manually,  
Does anyone know some manual technique for correct placement KERNING on a logo to achieve similar results?  (See image)

http://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t566/e390781/TypophileTwitter_zpszbxvgfsy.png

I know that the spacing is a matter of taste of the designer, but for example when writing a YELLOW word first distance is specified, then the first letter of the second are well adjusted, but all others must be set equal to have logical coherence,
What if it is done manually as you can reach a solution professional?

So the question is: Some techniques for MANUAL KERNING?
words of 3 to 10 characters maximum (eg a logo, a title, a word, a header star)

This topic fascinates me a lot, but so far have found very little, hope your help me Please.

Ok, very very good, yes, this is exactly what I need.
Now, one has to scoring fit in white letters,
But what is needed to place white lettering?

Because in the game we have blue letters and we have to guess to the white lettering.

I mean, does the person who put the white letters that use parameters?

We can realize that first established a TRAKING to accommodate after KERNING.

But how well placed white lettering? (KERNING)
¿Grope?
Lucky?
I think tenie must be a technique of greater accuracy.

that's what I try to say from the beginning ...
