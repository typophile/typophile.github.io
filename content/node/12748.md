  general terms a glyph is a symbol that has a meaning -- an arrow, a letter, et cetera.
  In digital typography the term refers to a single, specific instantiation of a character
  that appears in a font; the outlines for a particular punctuation, letters or [[Figures|figures]]
  (numbers). For example, a given [[OpenType]] font might have three different glyphs
  for a lowercase \"a\" character: a default double-story form, an alternate single-story
  form, and a small cap version. In that font, lowercase \"a\" is one character but
  three glyphs."
