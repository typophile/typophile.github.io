  and now I am looking for a font to accompany this new logo (see attachment below).\r\n\r\nRight
  now, I am using 'Helvetica Neue' which of course is completely overused and its
  shape has no resemblance with the boxy feel of my logo.\r\n\r\nSo I am looking for
  a font that has a more boxy feel and whose \"D\" ideally resembles the corners of
  my logo. \r\n\r\nIf you have any other suggestions / input, please let me know.
  But please don't be too harsh with me, logo design is not my main profession ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6258.png]"

    I've been staring at this far too long. \r\n\r\nAs for the fonts, Orbitron and
    Microgramma are too boxy in my opinion. They have more character than what I am
    aiming for. And I don't think they will scale down nicely at very low sizes?\r\n\r\n@hrant:

    \"funky balance\" approach. However, rather than FF Sheriff I coupled my logo
    with FF Tisa which I will mostly likely be using on my website anyway (or another
    font available through Typekit's \"personal plan\").\r\n\r\nHow do you like it?\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if it looks too \"medical\" or hospital-like. It should contain blue, but
    not necessarily green.\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_4753.png]\r\n\r\nP.S:
    I am not sure about kerning and the gap between the logo and the text either.
    Any advice on that one?"

    only four. That makes the symbol even simpler and I can more easily apply two
