body: Yes, I know, it&#39;s a tad overused. But what are some of your favorite examples
  of the typeface&#39;s use in places other than body text?

  body: Critique magazine &#40;RIP&#41; used it for display occasionally. It always
    startled me how good they managed to make it look. <BR> <BR>Coudal.com uses the
    bold weight to good effect for their headlines. <BR><a href="http://www.coudal.com"

  body: I love the way it&#39;s used in the advertisements for &#34;Six Feet Under&#34;,
    which I see from time to time in BART stations and other transit venues. I&#39;m
    not sure why it comes across so well to me; perhaps it&#39;s because the rest
    of the graphic design is so sophisticated that the choice of Times <i>has</i>
    to be conscious rather than default.

  body: Wolfgang Weingart uses it as his second typeface, after Akzidenz Grotesk.
    His book, <i>My Way to Typography</i> has its text set in it. <BR> <BR>In Germany,
    the academically minded publisher Suhrkamp used Times Bold for decades on its
    paperback covers. Willi Fleckhaus instituted that when he was Art Director there
    in the early 1960s. Later, the publishers changed his design so that it would
    be centered, uglifying the books &#40;in my opinion&#41;. Just recently, the publisher
    redesigned their image; book covers are now set in Adobe Garamond, and flush left
    again. German designers are up in arms about this that way that we were about
    the UPS logo change.

    <BR> <BR>How do they do that?  <BR>For some reason, it looks fine in MS Explorer,
    but not in Netscape.  <BR>Anyone can explain that?

    &#40;sorry isaac, had to point it out. maybe it&#39;s just the image though?&#41;

  body: It&#39;s not the image, and it&#39;s not a real apostrophe. But Mercury Rev
    can do that, right? Right? I know it&#39;s a huge faux pas, but it must be a Grand
    Statement about the proletarian nature of the band. I think that must be it.
