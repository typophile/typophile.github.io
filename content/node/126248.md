body: I'm nearly certain this is not a font since I had to digitally reproduce the
  glyphs  from signage in an old photograph, but I could be wrong. My main reason
  for posting was to see if anybody recognized the type, and if it had a name? possibly
  from an old specimen book or something?

    could use something like Superstar as a starting point to recreate the look:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/superstar-m54.font?text=GROCERIES"

    body: "Thanks for the feedback and link! I knew this was a hand painted sign but
      I guess I just figured there may be a specimen or alphabet it was based off
      of floating around somewhere.\r\n   I have actually created a font based on
      this sign using the existing glyphs while attempting to emulate the style of
      the original artist. I always wonder how the sign painter would have developed
      the rest of an alphabet...kind of feels like a puzzle with missing pieces. Anyways,
      I will post my interpretation here soon."
