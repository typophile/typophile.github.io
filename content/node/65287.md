body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nI have been doing graphic design work as part of my duties
  as a public sector communications professional for at least the past three years
  without any formal training. I made the decision recently to enroll in a design
  program in the evenings because I want to develop my skills and I love design. I
  have enjoyed the fact that design has become part of my job, but I recognize that
  on-the-job fumbling does not equal a proper education.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I would like
  to know what typefaces I should have on my computer to be able to produce some decent
  layout for class projects. I am frankly bored with the fonts that my PC provides
  (with some obvious exceptions). Some are certainly fine, but I'd like to expand
  the list of what is available to me on any given project.\r\n\r\nWhile I have used
  free fonts in the past for party invitations and such, I know their limitations.
  And some of them have severe limitations, obviously. I also believe that people
  should be paid for good typography. Therefore, I'm not at all opposed to paying
  for some good font families, but I don't want to spend much more than $300. I want
  to get more than just one or two fonts out of that, though.\r\n\r\nIs there any
  set of typefaces that I can buy together as a package in that price range so that
  I don't have to fall back on what's available on my PC? If so, which typefaces do
  you suggest? I will be doing fairly tradition layout. As far as typefaces are concerned,
  I am probably pretty traditional and the applications will be mainly on the staid,
  conservative end of things. As far as current foundries are concerned, I am a particularly
  a fan of the work of H&FJ. \r\n\r\nThanks for helping out a passionate amateur in
  the world of typography!\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: "As a professional in the world of typography, I personally \uFB01nd your
    simple request straightforward and challenging  :-)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m under the
    impression that you\u2019re apt to do decent typographic work with some tradional
    taste to it. If modesty allows, I\u2019d like to recommend [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-1-lat-corpus/|this
    typeface,]] which is a new design of the digital era, yet owes much of its flavour
    to good old Venetian Roman style tradition. For $128 you get a decent starter
    package of Regular, Italic and Bold (all you need in 95% of works); that leaves
    the bigger part of your budget for a good sans, or some lovely script face for
    embellishments\u2026 for instance."

    a friendly slab \u2013 no italics, still a steal!\r\nF"
