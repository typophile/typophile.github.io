body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : Uncial</strong>\r\n\r\nUncial letters, as well as [[Half
  Uncial]], evolved from Greco-Roman handwriting. during the mid to late Antique period.\r\n\r\nUncial
  letters are often classified as being thoroughly Irish, but this is misleading at
  best, and inaccurate at worst.\r\n\r\nLike almost all Roman things, there were western
  ([[Latin]]) and eastern ([[Greek]]) styles and variants. These would continuously
  influence each other.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick and other Catholic Missionaries most likely
  brought Uncials to Ireland in the fifth century. Over the next four hundred years,
  Irish monks would copy (and re copy) virtually all of classical literature, bringing
  it back to an (ungrateful) continent during the 700s\u2013800s.\r\n\r\nWhile the
  Irish monks were busy writing out old Greek and Latin books, they also wrote their
  own national legends down as well\u2014in the same handwriting style, of course,
  and in Gaelic (or whatever exactly the were speaking at the time). Unlike the religious
  texts, these stayed at home when the missionaries went to Europe to go a-preaching.\r\n\r\nAround
  this time, Charlemange commissioned his [[Carolingian Minuscule]], which are decidedly
  less decorative than uncial letterforms, yet still influenced by them. Charlemagne's
  court would have had a slew of Irish manuscripts at hand, but also books written
  in the (by now very different) Iberian uncials, Byzantine uncials, as well as any
  number of current Italian hands.\r\n\r\nThe Viking raids may have ended the glory
  days of Irish monasteries and book [[illumination]], but they did not pull uncials
  (or Gaelic) away from Ireland. Gaelic text remain written in uncial styles in Ireland
  to this very day, including street signs."
