  body: "I like the forms, but the spacing needs work (which is typical of Google
    fonts).\r\n\r\nBTW, Donegal and Headland are clearly siblings, but I'm not sure
    why their descriptions are so similar (and quite generic). Their main difference
    being the vertical proportions, it would be good to help people choose the right
    one depending on the intended setting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "OK, here's what I see. Doesn't make me right, and I'm much more comfortable
    when I can play with a font, but...\r\n\r\nSpacing may be off as hrant says, but
    I'd have to get it up in a metrics window, then print out a page of text I set,
    to comment. Just how my mind works.\r\n\r\nOn to the lower case. These are things
    I'd try before doing any work on spacing:\r\n\r\nI really like the g. A hard character
    to do, your balance here is quite nice. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the letters with descenders:
    the p and q are OK, deep enough to hold their own with that g. But something's
    amiss with the y, the descender just doesn't support the rest of the letterform.
    You could make both the v and y slightly narrower -- not more than 5/1000, but
    I'm not sure that would help, or even be the right approach. You could make the
    descender a little longer & see how things look. You could raise slightly -- 2
    to 5 1000 -- the junction of the y's arms, which perforce strengthens the descender,
    at the expense of the v-shape.\r\n\r\nI'd probably take 2 to 3 1000 out of the
    width of the n, h, and u. I *think* you've got the balance with the 3 about right,
    they're just a tiny bit wide.\r\n\r\nCaps -- I'm not so good with caps, but yours
    look fine to me, except... somehow, when the accents get added, they go wrong.
    I'm not sure why. Again, the first thing I'd try -- for print, anyhow -- is to
    make the acute/grave a little longer, and probably change the angle. I'd be tempted
    to just try the lc accents on the caps, at least for print. Nobody sets solid
    anymore, or even uses just 2 points of leading. I'd risk some tightness in the
    leading with accented caps if it made the glyphs look better.\r\n\r\nIt may be
    optical, but the macron looks thinner on the caps than the lc. That's not right.
    Same with the spacing of the dieresis dots, cap versus lc.\r\n\r\nAs I'm sure
    you know, for print, you need os figs & small caps. And of course, an italic...\r\n\r\nThis
    is a nice font. Personally, I'd be willing to put in the 3-4-5 days work on it
    I usually spend on any font, libre or no, in the hope of something rather special.
    Uh, if the italic's as good...\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: And I'd try an r with a bit shorter
    arm. You may have it right, but I'd like to see it a few units shorter to be convinced. "

    Regarding the U, I wonder why to use the lower case style.

  body: "@Eben: Don\u2019t know about the earliest examples dates in inscriptions,
    but [V] and [U] were obviously related, as in the beginning there was just [V].
    In manuscripts the form is already in use for v in rustica, and then in most uncial
    forms following that, so I think Hrant is pretty right.\r\nI see an eloquent example
    of the rustic calligraphy model here: http://www.edicionesemilianenses.com/rusticen.htm"
