  body: I suspect that Frutiger has been the single most influential typeface in the
    past thirty years. It established a pattern of opening the counters of the round
    letters c, e, etc., which has been widely followed, including by de Groot&#39;s
    Thesis. You can see it in many, many other sans, including Myriad - which is more
    humanist than Frutiger, though. [Helvetica etc are the most closed by comparison,
    and the tide has been running against them.]  <BR> <BR>I recently ran across <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=adsans" target="_blank">Adsans</a>
    of Walter Tracy, which opens the counters in a similar way, and is a decade older.
    I don&#39;t think it is artistically as successful, but it is a similar idea.
    I would be interested in the history of this opening of counters - which is a
    theme in Bringhurst - if anyone knows more about it. <BR> <BR>Thesis TheSans,
    compared to Frutiger, not only opens up the c and e more, but straightens the
    arms, and alters the shapes of the pdq to match; the hmn look narrower, it has
    a binocular g, etc. I don&#39;t think it is that close to Frutiger, compared to
    many others who also show Frutiger&#39;s &#40;or is it Adsans?&#41; heritage.    <BR>

    It established a pattern of opening the counters  <BR> <BR>Didn&#39;t someone
    here make the suggestion that Frutiger could be considered the beginning of a
    whole new family of sans faces. Along the geometric/grotesk/humanist classification.
    I don&#39;t have time to hunt for the post right now, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d
    disagree with that idea. <BR> <BR>&#62;I don&#39;t think it is that close to Frutiger
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d agree with William. I think faces like Prima &amp; Myriad are
    much closer in spirit to Frutiger. IMHO, TheSans is much closer to a &#39;humanist&#39;
    sans. Cf. the p, q, b, g, and the italics. Freakin&#39; love that bloody Q.'

  body: Wasn&#39;t Gill Sans/London Underground one of the first to claim these features?
    Gill was designed in the 20&#39;s-30&#39;s and the other was made in 1916.

    of a different school. <BR> <BR>As for Adsans, it&#39;s not supposed to be &#34;pretty&#34;
    - and technically it&#39;s many notches above Frutiger. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Matthew, I think you&#39;re right. ITC Johnston Underground is not as open
    as Gill, and I think Frutiger still more open, but the humanist proportions are
    what does it, and Johnston and Gill I believe started this. As Bringhurst explains,
    it seems that Frutiger&#39;s idea was to bring some humanist features to a more
    geometrical face. The openness &#40;compared to his &#39;Universe&#39;&#41; also
    was probably influenced by his task of making very legible signage that could
    be seen at a distance a Charles DeGaulle Airport. '

  body: Yeah, myriad is very close to frutiger, but still, a lot of the plain letters
    of TheSans resemble frutiger. TheSans&#39;s italics are fantastic and blow frutiger
    out of the water. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not defending frutiger at all, in fact, I quite
    dislike it. But though there are a lot of glyphs that don&#39;t follow frutiger,
    I think there are some that do. I&#39;m actually debating my former professor
    on this. He thinks TheSans is a frutiger knock-off, I think he&#39;s crazy. I&#39;m
    trying to play his side &#40;though it&#39;s a weak leg to stand on&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>This is awesome input for me. I appreciate it. <BR> <BR>Hrant, how is de Groot&#39;s
    stuff of a different school? As in, it&#39;s more fluid, post-modern, rounded,
    etc? I&#39;m just an observer. Tell me how you <i>feel</i>.

  body: The prototype for Eras came out in the early 60s &#40;I recall seeing it in
    some Paris Matchs of that era&#41;. There was also Antique Olive. Is the &#34;unfolded
    humanist&#34; a Gallic phenom?

  body: I agree, he&#39;s crazy. But I am a Frutiger fan. It requires some occasional
    special considerations, but I&#39;ve made good use of it. I like its friendly,
    but not goofy or overly-casual feel. <BR> <BR>Though, I admit that TheSans&#39;s
    italics are much more interesting than Frutiger&#39;s obliques.

  body: He&#39;s probably not crazy, just not sensitive enough to type. <BR> <BR>&#34;School&#34;
    probably makes de Groot sound more conformist than he is - he&#39;s certainly
    not a slave to the Noordzij school for example, although my point was exactly
    that his stuff is more humanist than Frutiger, which is like a not-humanist-enough
    derivation of Univers &#40;the latter being  a neo-grotesk&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Adsans was designed for tiny sizes on lousy paper. Making even a passable
    lo-fi font is harder than making a great &#34;normal&#34; font. Just look at the
    [intentional mis]alignment in the &#34;g&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    released <BR>it, I&#39;m guessing Frutiger was <BR>very aware of it and in turn
    <BR>at least a little influenced <BR>by it. Just a guess.
