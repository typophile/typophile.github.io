  to be Venetian/Garalde judging by the "E" but I could be wrong. The image is very
  low res so it''s hard to tell if the bowel is disconnected on the "P" and what''s
  going on with the upper serif of the "A". I''d appreciate any help identifying or
  at least getting close. '

  body: "I think you are right that this is possibly [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/times-new-roman/|Times
    New Roman]]. I think the poor scan may have distorted the top of the A. The shape
    of the S and the N, as well as the E, are all indications of some variety of Times.
    TNR seems a bit narrower, maybe, than your sample, when you look at the N. Also
    the middle arm on the E seems heavier, but the overall shapes say Times.\r\n\r\n-
