  body: I like that last one, with the larger '09. You could extend the top stroke
    of the F a bit further, although maybe not as far as in the previous one. I also
    think Michael's F avoids the possibility of yours being mistaken for a J.

    caught up on is the overlap on the t at the end. I''d like it better if it were
    just a smooth line. The other examples are nice as well. '
