body: 'I have to typeset a bunch of stuff bilingual in German and English at the moment
  and have some questions &#40;which weren&#39;t entirely answered in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20924.html?1069454997"
  target="_blank">this thread</a>&#41;. All help appreciated. <BR> <BR>N.B. -- this
  could be complicated by the fact that the audience is Swiss &#40;Basel&#41;, and
  I understand there are some peculiarities there regarding the use of guillemets
  instead of the standard German quote marks ... anyway: <BR> <BR>1&#41; My particular
  concerns are the citing of the titles of artworks, books etc. In English, I set
  titles of works, books, films etc. italic, and I set titles of exhibitions, journals,
  articles etc. in single quotes. <BR> <BR>Everything &#40;like, everything I mentioned
  above&#41; in the translated texts I&#39;ve received seems to be set in double German
  quotes &#40;with the &#39;low nines&#39; left and &#39;high sixes&#39; right&#41;,
  which make the page very gappy. Is it familiar/acceptable to use italics or single
  quotes for any of these purposes in German? <BR> <BR>2&#41; With ref to the Swiss
  thing, I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s common in Switzerland to use guillemets instead
  of quotes. But would that be the German ones &#40;facing &#39;inwards&#39;&#41;
  or the French style &#40;facing &#39;outwards&#39;&#41;? And only for speech, or
  for the things I mentioned above also? I guess the intent is that German, Italian
  and French texts are set the same way? <BR> <BR>Sorry to be so dumb. I promise I&#39;ve
  ordered a copy of Der Duden &#40;see link above&#41;. But it&#39;s going to take
  4-6 weeks to arrive. <BR> <BR>Rob'

    <BR>The Italic thing is ok, but don&#39;t use single quotes &#40;out of the double
    quotes content&#41; in a professional text. If you find it ugly, guillemets are
    quite good in German too and its common for your Swiss audience. But note the
    difference in the directions for the German usage of guillemets. ;-&#41; <BR>
    <BR>If you have to deal with other languages too, you should prefer the guillemets.
    <BR> <BR>BTW. The Duden is a German only book. An english version like the Oxford-Duden
    German Dictionary should you serve better - but its only a thought.

    much less of a pain than constant quote marks.  <BR> <BR>In German the Guillemets
    are reversed, like this: '
