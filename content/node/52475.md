body: "Hi there! I am a graphic design and advertising student working on a corporate
  identity project.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a littering campaign assignment
  for a state government. The rational behind the campaign is that litter starts small,
  and as it accumulates becomes a big problem, therefore, one should stop littering
  as to not start a mass mess.\r\nP/s: Brochure will be a door fold and is still under
  construction, as such part of it still needs more text. Contributions on your view
  on littering is greatly appreciated as with the design/typographic side of it.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  the criteria for the assignments include application of the campaign onto a minimum
  of 8 different medias, therefore, any media suggestions would be great too. :)\r\n\r\nAs
  of now, i plan to do:\r\nPrint Adverts\r\nBillboards\r\nAdvertorial\r\nBrochure\r\nDustbin
  (?)\r\nPlastic Bag (Not really turning out too well for me. =/)\r\nAmbiance (ideas
  needed.)\r\nStickers (to be stuck on random stuff that could be litter/ or to remind
  people to not litter that item) (?)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys! =)"
