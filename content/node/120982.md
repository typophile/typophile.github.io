  body: "There are quite a few similar high contrast [thick and thin] sans fonts that
    have been digitized but I found none that match all of the letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    closest digital that I found is Radiant EF Text Black -- only the _J_, _a_, _c_,
    _f_, _r_ and _s_ are substantially different.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RadiantEFTextBlackAsItalianFilmUC_5858.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/RadiantEFTextBlackAsItalianFilmLC_4898.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/radiant/\r\nMatch
    could be improved by selective horizontal expansion and editing of details.\r\nDon"
