  tilde-like cross strokes on the A and the E seem to be distinguishing features to
  me... any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alcove_1_3647.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/alcove_2_5451.JPG]"

  body: "This resembles many of the sign-painter fonts that can be found at Letterhead
    Fonts. Just a quick look came up with <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/esoteric3.shtml\">Esoteric</a>,
    which has three variants, including one that I think is fairly similar to your
    style. There may be others on the site.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
