  to take typography classes, was there any type things you wished they had mentioned
  now that your doing the type/design thing for real? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Michael '

  body: Sorry, I learned very little from those classes, only enough to affect how
    I used type in design and of course, the lost art of specing type for a typesetter
    - I went to school in &#39;91 mind you . . . <BR> <BR>I wished they would have
    taught me about the color of type, an understanding of the source of glyph shapes
    &#40;eg. how the lowercase r relates to the n , m and h&#41;, and how balanced
    weights and ink traps should be employed in glyph design for both on screen and
    printed applications. <BR> <BR>Do you teach a typography class? <BR> <BR>If so,
    I also wish they would have mentioned with enough commitment and effort this is
    profession you can do full-time and earn a living at. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: my typography classes rocked with one Mrs. Janice Klassen. The school fliped
    her to another dept. after the 2 year, but her cirriculum and the schedules she
    organized were amazing. I don&#39;t think there was anything she missed. Every
    student loved her classes, cursed her project dealines, pop quizzes, and in class
    assignments scaling paragraphs of 8pt garamond to .17pt, by hand while she peeked
    over our shoulders pointing out spelling errors and suggesting the x-height was
    way off 30 minutes before class ended. <BR> <BR>Now 3rd year, the new profs ended
    up covering the same content Klassen had already taught, even though we had mentioned
    it over and over. Sneaking suspicion that they didn&#39;t know anything more.
    <BR> <BR>I had expected to learn how to implement everything we had learned. Technical
    aspects like whats Type 1, Type 3, TrueType, Postscript, Magnectic Pens and all
    that. What programs do you make typefaces with &amp; how &#40;Klassen taught us
    design, no computers&#41;. Legalities and sale/contracting info. Current affairs,
    hotbeds, trends could have been useful. Instead history, bowls, weight, and descenders
    were discussed while we all fell asleep.
