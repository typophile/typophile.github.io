  the Rings Blu Ray trailer?\r\nhttp://www.lordoftherings.net/ [[click play trailer]]\r\n\r\nIn
  some places Trajan is used. I am trying to find the other font,\r\nit looks similar
  to hightower text roman, anziano pro, centaur, adobe garamond, itc legacy serif,
  or adobe jenson bold.\r\nthere is an unofficial font called ringbearer that is close
  but not right.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to be 100% on the exact font.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fte_4169.png]"

    The conversion to 3D lettering may account for the slight change in R proportions,
    or possibly the R was modified, but the overall resemblance seems to me to be
    very close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Good eye, Mike. I had thought of Arno Pro as a close match but Octavian is
    much better. I think the R (with its right leg going beneath the bottom line)
    is a custom change due to the RS combination in FIRST. Don't you think the S has
    been changed too (bottom left) to better fit with the (lowered) right foot of
    the R? Interestingly we have the same R in EVER, too.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

    seemed about right to me, but my eyes were never as calibrated as yours Andreas.\r\n\r\n-

    that could be the 3D treatment.\r\nThanks again, really appreciated."
