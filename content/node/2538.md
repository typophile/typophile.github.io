  body: I can&#39;t help you with the Village Inn logo &#40;which I&#39;ll bet was
    custom-drawn&#41;. But the tagline below is Seagull Heavy, artificially condensed.

  body: Y&#39;know the more I stared at this one, the more obvious it became to me
    . . . <BR> <BR>It feels like the Disney Magic Kingdom logotype. And I can swear
    there are several knockoffs of it as well . . . <BR> <BR>In addiiton I seem to
    recall a foundry that made a font called Swiss Chalet &#40;not House Chalet&#41;
    but I have been unsuccessful in my Googling of the name or related names . . .
    <BR> <BR>Perhaps another path that will lead somewhere . . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Yes, that&#39;s what I had in mind and it&#39;s close but the bottom of the
    letterforms are different than the specimen above, also the &#39;a&#39; in the
    kingdom font is a single story &#39;a&#39;. <BR> <BR>Treehouse is a great little
    foundry I recall first noticing back in 1997. I remember being smitten with their
    Rocketeer font Aeronaut. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, thanks for the scoop Mike, I think it&#39;s
    a case of similar feeling font vs. actual typeface. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D
