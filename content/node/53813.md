  body: Nice answers. Art Directors at bigger studios or corporations often oversee
    just a particular segment of design or at least different teams. So you might
    have an art director for interactive design and another for package design. The
    CD would oversee all these, then someone who knows almost nothing of design will
    oversee the CD.

  body: 'They seem like somewhat subjective terms based on the firm/company. Probably
    could be used interchangeably, however, my Creative Director tells my Art Director
    what to do. Personally I don''t like the term "Director". The director of a movie
    usually doesn''t act. The director of a band usually doesn''t play lead guitar.
    The athletic director of a university usually doesn''t play on the team. You get
    the idea. My point - that my Art Director still does plenty of graphic design
    but coordinates client requests, tracks time, bills clients works with print vendors,
    and many other tasks. '

    are so abstract now. Traditionally the Art Directors would present their ideas
    to the Creative Directors who would give feedback and yay/nays.. but everything
    is more blurred now. For instance the place I work as an Art Director, the Creative
    Directors are called Senior Partners and sometimes I work with them on projects.
    The Project Managers are called Producers, which is traditionally the name of
    people in production, but now we call the production people Developers.\r\n\r\nAlso
    in advertising the Creative Directors could have either come from an Art Direction
    OR Copywriting background."

    remember attempting to do a custom typeface for the CD (who came from copy and
    was in the business for years). I would show him test words and his comments were
    completely unhelpful in communicating what he was after. After several rounds
    he said that he liked what I did, but wished it were more musical, and that he
    was asking everyone on the project to listen to music (any music) while the worked
    on the campaign.\r\n\r\nHe was fired and I got a kill fee."

    pairs or there are more AD CDs... In interactive agencies there are definitely
    more from the AD side.

    director or design director is the creative head of a design firm, advertising
    agency or an in-house corporate design department. In all of these areas, key
    responsibilities can include the development of graphic design, advertising, communications
    and industrial design publications.\r\n</cite>\r\n<cite>Art director\r\nThe art
    director establishes the conceptual and stylistic direction for design staff and
    orchestrates their work, as well as the work of production artists, photographers,
    illustrators, prepress technicians, printers and anyone else who is involved in
    the development of a project. The art director generally selects vendors and,

    really not.\r\n\r\nIt's true that older creative directors are often writers,
    but now a days most agencies have pairs of CD's (one writer and one art director)
    running the creative departments. This is true of all the large agencies - Ogilvy,
    MacLaren, JWT etc etc. In smaller agencies that handle a lot of interactive accounts
    it's common to find single CD's of Art Direction backgrounds running things. This
    is true of medium sized agencies - Grey, Lowe etc etc.\r\n"

    art directors have no direct reports and are really graphic designers or senior

    from multiple disciplines. It is still the exception that graphic designers become
    Creative Directors who manage employees of multiple disciplines outside of graphic

  body: Reading several of these posts make me think that the Creative Director is
    not always a graphic designer and doesn't necessarily know how to use InDesign
    or Photoshop (for example). Am I right to infer that Art Directors are the ones
    who have more practical computer design experience?

  body: "It's not really traditional... those job descriptions Nick wrote still pretty
    much hold true in the advertising industry. Art Director and Copywriter teams
    present to the Creative Director(s) who have the final say in what concepts go
    to the client.\r\n\r\nIt's true there is a lot of overlap now between Art Director
    and Graphic Designer now though. Previously the Art Director would do concept
    development and then hand a large portion of the design work to the Graphic Designers.
    Now Art Directors generally design (pixel push) the layout and look, and rely
    on Graphic Designers for expanding the concept look and feel into other sizes
    or medias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlenn, most creative directors started out as art directors
    and copywriters, so they do know how to use the programs and stuff. When you're
    promoted to Creative Director it's more your role to oversee the entire creative
    department and give the thumbs up/thumbs down to what gets through - the idea
    being at that level you're probably a genius at strategy and what sells or whatever.\r\nI
    found at the larger agencies the CD's never really did any design work themselves..
    just provided feedback to the rest of the team regarding layout and strategy.
    But at smaller agencies it wasn't uncommon for CD teams to brainstorm with us
    or take on briefs themselves. The agency I work at now is around 90 people, and
    I often work with a CD team on projects. They make me do most of the design work
    though :)"

  body: "As a CD who began as an AD, my experience has been that the lower on the
    totem pole, the more tactical, the higher, more strategic. As a CD, I guide the
    creative product to ensure it is appropriate in strategy and voice. I also teach
    more. As an AD, I am more hands-on with concepting, hiring the right photographer,
    illustrator or writer, and deal more with vendors like printers, jingle writers
    and producers.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that in an ad agency setting, by the time
    you've been in the business 3-5 years, an AD should be able to come up with headlines
    and copy direction (though not necessarily write finished copy), and a writer
    should be able to visualize and describe accurately the look and feel of an ad
    (though not necessarily be able to draw, design or art direct). The most effective
    people I've seen in either discipline have been able to do that."
