  body: "The problem with Comic Sans is not that it is not Helvetica, Times Roman,
    or Garamond, et cetera. The problem is that its application range as an informal
    handprinted type is also very limited; it's not even an acceptable comic word
    balloon typeface, for example.\r\n\r\nSo, Comic Sans, you just go off with Papyrus
    - and get stuffed."
