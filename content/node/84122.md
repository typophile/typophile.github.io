  work with a small publisher, doing all of their typesetting for their romance titles.
  I have been using Adobe Garamond Pro, and have been pleased with the results. It
  is readable and relatively neutral looking.\r\n\r\nI'm now working with a second
  publishing house, also romance novels. They are currently using Book Antiqua for
  the body of the novel. I personally think this is an awful choice. I want recommend
  some alternatives, but I don't want the books to end up looking identical to the
  ones I design for the other publisher. Some font choices I have been considering
  are Kepler, Berling, and Caslon. I'm looking for a Pro font that is very readable
  and relatively neutral in appearance, particularly for the quotation marks (one
  of the things I hate about Book Antiqua). I also don't want anything that stands
  out as very modern, because many of the books are historical romance (which possibly
  explains the Book Antiqua choice...)\r\n\r\nSo, are there any recommendations? What
  is your favorite font for setting long pieces of text?"

    like literature (or history) than romance.\r\nHow about Dante? With its large
    x-height it will set quite big, and still have a traditional appearance."

  body: 'If you are considering a Caslon, check out my [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams
    Caslon Text]]. It will look classic, but have warmth. The swash caps might work
    to add a note of romance to headings. For titles you can pair it with Big Caslon,
    which a number of people have done. '

  body: I'm not sure, though, why Palatino looks terrible for the body of a romance
    novel. Although, I'll admit that while I have seen Palatino used in fine printing,
    it has generally been used in nonfiction works.

  body: "Palatino/Book Antiqua is like using a slightly fancier version of Times New
    Roman. Nothing horribly bad, but nothing horribly eye-catching either because
    of overuse.\r\n\r\nI'd think of something Vendome-ish, personally."

  body: I went with Dante Pro for the historical romance lines. I took a look at the
    Vendome, but it is a bit too fancy for my needs. I really need a font that will
    blend into the background and not seem dis-synchronous with the text, KWIM? Dante
    Pro seems to fit the bill.
