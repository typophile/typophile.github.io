  body: Troubador Script. David Rakowski digitized Troubador <BR>Light, an inline
    version of Troubador, as <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?q=rechtman&amp;nb_ppp_old=10&amp;page=1&amp;text=Your+Ticket+Paradise%21&amp;nb_ppp=10&amp;classt=alpha"
    target="_blank"> Rechtman</a>. <BR>The treatment of your image text, however,
    is different <BR>from the inline. <BR> <BR>There is a Rechman bold &#40;solid&#41;
    out there, that would <BR>probably work better, but I can&#39;t find it just now.

    cares to know.&#41;

  body: David Rakowski related to me years ago that he no longer cares a hoot about
    his old shareware fonts. As to the requested donations to Columbia University&#39;s
    Music Department in those old ReadMe&#39;s, he wrote, &#34;You can send nothing
    at all, with my blessing, or any amount, not to exceed $14,000, also with my blessing.
    The money still goes to a good cause, but I no longer have a stake in it, so to
    speak&#34;.

  body: He also says more or less the same thing on <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ziodavino/album1_009.htm">  his
    website</a>, where he discusses the period during which he had his affair with
    fonts. <BR> <BR>&#34;At this point, I&#39;m no longer interested in the care and
    feeding of typefaces, and am ignoring any e-mails about fonts that come my way.
    Y&#39;all may continue to do what you wish with the shareware fonts, and send
    money to Columbia University if you feel that is what you must do. Me, I&#39;ve
    got symphonies to write and cats to feed.&#34; <BR> <BR>Funny guy. <BR>&#34;If
    it&#39;s a font from the &#39;90&#39;s that you&#39;re really, really tired of,
    there&#39;s a good chance it may have started with me. These fonts were seriously
    in vogue for a while, and some are still seen everywhere, particularly Eraser
    Dust &#40;characters in South Park write on the blackboard with it&#41;. Homestar
    Runner uses Pixie a lot. When you see these fonts, blame me.&#34;
