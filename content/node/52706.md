  used on navy ships. I think most countries use a similar typeface on their vessels.
  They usually are angular letters (like Gridnik for example). If anyone has any tips,
  let me know! :)\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: This isn't likely to be much practical help -- it's unlikely to specify any
    fonts by name -- but the applicable standard is [[http://www.astm.org/Standards/F906.htm|ASTM
    F906]]. I haven't found an online copy.
