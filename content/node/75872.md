  body: "I'm not sure about the font in the subline. I guess you're trying to pair
    them via contrast, but they're so different that nothing really seems to bind
    them together. \r\n(I must admit I also don't really understand the subline, but
    that's probably just a language/comprehension issue on my part.)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    in the main mark the \"LA\" makes a huge gap. Actually kerning is kinda spotty
    overall. Straight-straights (and stuff like \"NC\") need more space compared to
    straight-slants. See how in GROUP there is more white between the \"R\" and the
    \"O\" than the other letters, due do the shape of the \"R\"? And the first word
    has a lot of slants, which need compensation. \r\nI'd recommend to focus on 3
    letters at a time and try to make them equidistant in terms of how much \xABair\xBB
    is between them (so first focus on \"BLA\", then on \"LAN\" etc.)."
