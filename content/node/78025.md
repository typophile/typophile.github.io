    in these types tied to a project?

    to Precious Sans may be E. Kayser\u2019s Prokyon (http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/)"

  body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your comments.\r\n\r\nIn need this font for
    a identity logotype for a network services company.\r\n\r\nI choose these two
    fonts because are fresh looking\r\nI want that the \"n\" doesn't have the ascender
    and \"a\" the descender.\r\n\r\nPrecious sans meets the first one but not the
    second.\r\n\r\nUbuntu meets booth but is rather common.\r\n\r\nI try to find the
    font of this company logo without success.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.connection.uk.com]]
    (althoug not big fan of the kerning BTW)\r\n\r\nSo, that's the reason I was looking
    for help.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"
