  close look the serifs are off and the e has an extra serif on the top right edge.
  The main difference from Tiffany is that the serifs in Tiffany are rounded on the
  tips and they are squared in the logo. The serifs are a little different in length
  and angle as well.\r\n\r\nI have researched Tiffany's heritage (Ronaldson and Caxton)
  with no clues.\r\n\r\nPlease if anyone has any ideas what it may be, I would be
  very greatful.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: How old is this sample? Are they any examples beyond the logo? If not, it
    is likely custom lettering.

    If it's an old logo, it may have lost some details when it was digitized.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I'm not sure of its age, but the company goes back to the 1800's. The company
    claims the logo is very old.\r\n\r\nI agree that it really looks like Tiffany,
    but the thing that is odd is that it didn't LOOSE detail in digitizing, it GAINED
    detail. An example is the additional serif on the upper lip of the e in Tiffany.
    It is not there on the older logo font.\r\n\r\nThere is no vector version of their
    logo anywhere. I have tried in vain to locate one. Everyone just keeps saying
    it's very old...\r\n\r\nI had hoped I could simply trace the horse C and lay in
    Tiffany to get an honest vector version of the logo. Now I have to think about
    digital hand tracing the entire logo or trying to rework Tiffany to match.  AARGH!\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate your efforts one and all.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

  body: "It's probably based on Ronaldson Oldstyle, which is one of the models used
    for Tiffany. I can't quickly find a modern digitization, but there's probably
    one out there somewhere.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the specific image you posted shows
    pretty clear signs of being digitally traced. My guess is that the logo started
    life as Ronaldson and was then cleaned up.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the original Ronaldson
    has a straight 'e'. I'm not sure where Tiffany's slanted one came from - perhaps
    the same source as this logo."

    when I said some details were lost. If the person doing the digitization didn't
    know the logo was based on Tiffany, or didn't have a digital copy to use, they
    could have overlooked some details such as the 'e' serif, especially if they were
    digitizing from a reproduction of a reproduction.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "UPDATE:\r\n\r\nJust spoke with my wife, who represents this company in the
    US. Apparently the le Crin company (which makes textiles from horse hair tail)
    dates back to the end of Napoleon's time (1814). My wife was in the archives in
    France not long ago and found a document from well before the turn of the century.
    She just told me it had nearly the same logo on it. In fact most I speak with
    in France believe this is the original logo.\r\n\r\nObviously I can stop looking
    for the font, but what's interesting to me is that the logo is so very similar
    to Tiffany, yet the logo with the tilted e (almost identical in every way save
    the lip serif) pre-dates Tiffany by about 150 years. The le Crin company was founded
    in 1814. Tiffany was designed by Edward Benguiat in 1974.\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken
    the top of the influence design tree (Ronaldson) dates from around the same time
    as the founding of le Crin. Yet, Ronaldson or Claxton do not have a tilted e.
    It makes me wonder about the history of tilting the e? Is it part of a movement
    or maybe a signature foundry style?\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you to all who contributed.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

  body: "The logo may have evolved over the years, changing subtly while still retaining
    the feel of the original. The Napoleonic version of the logo would probably look
    the same to most casual observers, but I would bet it uses a different typeface,
    and most likely a slightly different version of the horse.\r\n\r\nTake a look
    at the Coca-Cola logo or the Ford motors logo. These have stayed essentially the
    same since they were designed way back when, but if you compare a version from
    today with the original, you'll find many differences.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
