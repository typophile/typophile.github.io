  upon as not being for book work there are several faces designed for the Ludlow
  that are quite usable for books.\r\nUntil I can make a scan of them I'll name them:
  Eusebius, Goudy, Garamond, and Stellar. There may be a few others but these are
  ones that I chose based on their typographic merits. Stellar is a sans serif type
  that is quite nice for its weight and balance."
