  body: "That's a different face--some sort of Garamond. (Looks like ATF Garamond
    or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/amsterdamer-garamont/\">Amsterdamer
    Garamont</a> to me.)\r\n\r\nIn your first sample, that could still be Times. The
    hot metal Linotype Times Roman \"C\" looks like that in the smaller sizes. If
    it's an older book, it might have been set on a Linotype machine."
