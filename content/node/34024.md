  my 6 month old baby boy. I'm planning to use the logo for his baptismal invitation.\r\n\r\nI'm
  attaching a JPG file with my initial direction for the logo.Please disregard kerning/tracking
  and other similar issues, I still have to clean up the type.\r\n\r\n1. Which do
  you think is the better design that I should focus on?\r\n2. What do you think of
  pairing geometric shapes with Emigre Dalliance? (as in design [a])  Though I think
  I still have to adjust the weight of the geometric shape to better match the weight
  of Dalliance.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your feedback.\r\n\r\nJoseph\r\n \r\n\r\n"

    I like the mark, it doesn't say \"innocent\" to me, which is what I would think
    a personal logo for a baby would try to convey. Have you tried playing around
    with Dalliance as the logo?"

    your comments:\r\n1. I think I will explore more of D and E.\r\n2. I have to remedy
    the hard geometric shapes which is not quite   representative of a baby. (Thanks

    honest answer to your question :)\r\n\r\nThanks guys.\r\n\r\nJoseph"

  body: a logo for a baby? why? why? babies are humans not products or brands. people
    may brand themselves for business reasons, but your child? really? sorry, but
    this is very strange to me

    duh!\r\n\r\nI've been working on an ambigram logo for my kids as well. \r\n\r\nKids,
    I've found, are also highly logo-aware. For better and worse, of course, but it
    is something that appeals to them."

    been studying Langdon's work lately to get a deeper insight into ambigrams since
    I would really like to add at least one to my work.\r\nAs for Nick's question,
    I have to admit I also like the idea of a logo for a kid. Imagine growing up &
    beeing able to send out birthday invitations with your own logo on it. Now tell
    me, what kid wouldn't like that?"

    Bailey</a>, a recent Drexel U grad, he's been working along side John Langdon
    for the last 3 year. He might be able to pass on some of the wisdom he's garnished
    from John.

    a prob, it was totally by chance that I noticed he worked for Langdon, Dave posted
    his resume for a crit, and his (still current) work experience with Langdon was
    top billing.\r\n\r\nIsn't that's what Typophile is for, bringing together creative

    sharp corners and boldness. Unless you're hoping that your baby grows up to create
    cheap designer sportswear, Lance Enzo should have less of a Tommy Hilfiger or
    Ralph Lauren vibe.\r\n\r\nE is the only one that seems to even resemble having
    a childlike quality but it still leaves me with a why bother feeling. What does
    that typeface say about your son? And how long does this branding last anyway?
    How long until he outgrows his logo?"
