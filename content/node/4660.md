body: Does anyone know if it is possible to get Rodney Shelden Fehsenfeld&#39;s fonts
  anymore?  Specifically, I would like to use permatype for a project I&#39;m working
  on now.  If anyone has suggestions or directions, I would much appreciate it.

  body: Rodney pulled everything off the market and is focusing on other creative
    endeavors right now. Send me your email address and phone info and I&#39;ll send
    them to Rodney to see if he&#39;s interested in licensing his fonts to you for
    your project. <BR> <BR>tamye at typelife.com
