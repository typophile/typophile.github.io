body: "Hello all - \r\n\r\n\r\nThe sample: a clean italic from Space Collective -
  lovely stuff.\r\n\r\nThe reason: I'm on the hunt for a multiweight sanserif with
  crisp italics (I'm a sucker for those drop 'f's) - something a bit more modern,
  ala Tarzana, minus the outlandish 'k' and 'E' - any recommendations?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Reed"
