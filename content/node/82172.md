body: "Please help me identify this font.  I have to recreate this logo for their
  company.  The closest font I have found to this is JasmineUPC but it\u2019s not
  quite the same. The lower-case \u2018a\u2019 is completely different. I also don't
  know what capital letters in the font look like because all I have to go on are
  the limited lower-case letters used in this logo. Thanks in advance to anyone that
  can help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scan_3461.jpg]"
