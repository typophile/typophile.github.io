  be used with [[Optima]]. Optima is being used in an identity for a medical practice,
  and I'd like to find a good workhorse (but elegant) companion text family to be
  used for correspondence, letter writing, advertising, etc.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?
  \ Your views are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAndrew"

  body: "Optima can serve in text. It's not been used a lot for books, but it is designed
    for that use. You might investigate the new Optima Nova, whose italics are more
    useful for their intended purpose than the original sloped romans. It has 7 weights,
    small caps, even italic small caps, plus a few condensed weights. There are several
    weights that would be very nice to see used together in small sizes. If you have
    the budget, spring for the whole family and get the beautiful titling caps too.
    \r\n\r\nOtherwise, Optima is quite difficult to use with other faces. Other Zapf
    designs seem most comfortable with it. Try Aldus, or Melior, or for a little freshness
    Zapf Renaissance or Aurelia. "

    Aldus for text. Both have their merits, but I'm a sucker for long extenders.

  body: "The original metal Optima was too light and grey in text, IMHO. \r\n\r\nI
    suspect Optima Nova is better in text, because it has added weight, especially
    at what were light terminals. \r\n\r\nThis might be a terrible idea or a good
    one--I haven't tried it because I don't own Optima--but Century Schoolbook might
    pair with the regular or bold weight of Optima. It also is a great workhorse,
    and works better than most on letter size paper because of its width. "

  body: "Century Schoolbook + Optima???? \r\n\r\nAhem. \r\n\r\nYes, Optima in metal.
    I think the usefulness of Optima might be revitalized by the presence of so many
    new text weights in Optima Nova. The Regular, Medium and Demi could help relieve
    some of the wispiness, but the design is relentlessly vertical in its axis, which
    can give a sleepy texture at any weight.\r\n\r\nZapf has described Optima as a
    serifless Modern face, which implies that Bodoni would be a good companion, but
    the proportions are so different from most Moderns that I would expect to reject
    a pile of them before you found one that worked. Still, it's worth a try, if you
    think the text can withstand it. "

  body: "<em>Zapf has described Optima as a serifless Modern face</em>\r\n\r\nchapter,
    verse! i wanna reference for that one.\r\n\r\nto me Optima is the epitome of the
    [[humanist]] [[sanserif]]. And apparently i'm not the only one, as that's the
    category Lawson puts it in in [[Letters of Credit]]. As noted before, the proportions
    are all wrong, and the flaring strokes are so calligraphic it's not even funny.
    I think that geometric sans pair better with [[modern]] faces, and Optima is anything
    but geometric. i believe Bringhurst will back me up on the modern/geometric pairing
    convention, but if you call my bluff, i'll look up references for you..."

  body: "I'm not going to call your bluff. I remember what Bringhurst says about a
    sans companion to Bodoni. That's interesting! \r\n\r\nHZ says:\r\n\r\n\"Optima
    was designed in 1952 ...... It is an alphabet design between a neo-classical roman
    (like Bodoni) and a sans serif (like Futura).\"\r\n\r\nThis is from his notes
    in the Grolier Club exhibit catalog \"The Fine Art of Letters\".\r\n\r\nOptima
    is also described as a serifless roman. Because of its contrast, it's a little
    of an outlier if included in the \"Humanist Sans\" category.\r\n\r\nZapf's modern
    faces also have many of the aforementioned traits. In Marconi, Zapf Book, etc.
    etc. he reshapes the proportions of the Modern idiom to something more juicy,
    more calligraphic, with a little more proportional interest. So it's no surprise
    he sees Optima as a serifless version of what would be a \"modern\" face in his
    hands. \r\n\r\nI'm not going to argue about how to classify Optima. The reason
    is the very problem raised in this thread: What can you use with it? Again, stay
    inside the world of Zapf's faces and you're sure to find a suitable serifed companion.
    There are plenty. \r\n\r\nI think John Nolan's suggestions are excellent. Acanthus'
    italic would agree nicely with the new italics in Optima Nova. "

  body: "Carl, you make some good points. And really, Optima might be too lapidary/monumental/architectural
    (at least in its UC) to qualify as a true Humanist Sans.\r\n\r\nI would however
    add:\r\n1) Maybe Zapf's \"between\" business was due to terminological paucity
    and/or a layman-targeted dumbing-down thing.\r\n2) You could say that stroke contrast
    makes it <strong>more</strong> humanist... So maybe Paul was in a way right that
    it's the epitome.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    variation in the width of its caps. But it is much more like the ''modern'' typefaces
    and geometric sans in having very wide bowls in its lower case. The more recent
    sans called ''humanist'', following syntax, have oval bowls. '
