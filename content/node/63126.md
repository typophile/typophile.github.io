  \r\n\r\nHow do I turn? I believe that without the T activated I can\xB4t use the
  symbol as .ttf font\r\n\r\nIs this correct? \r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate this information.

  body: "I don\u2019t work with truetype hints, so I don\u2019t know the answer. But
    I can tell you that truetype hinting is a very difficult thing to do. Do you really
    need to do it by yourself? If so, reading the Fontlab manual (chapter 9) could
    be a good place to start.\r\n\r\nTo download the Mac version press [[http://www.fontlab.ch/downloads/manuals/FLS5MacManual.zip|here]].\r\nTo

    luck."
