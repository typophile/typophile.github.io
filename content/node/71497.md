  type 1 font? I double-click them and get \"blah blah blah is not a valid font file.\"\r\n-Tried
  comparing the font info to a working font in the same family and that got me nowhere
  but an hour older.\r\n-looked through Learning Fontlab Fast, and the Fontlab manual--which
  made my brain explode (never been able to find what I'm looking for in there).\r\n-Finally
  tried to save the fontlab file under a new name.\r\nI'm at a complete and utter
  loss on this one.\r\n\r\n...maybe if I copied all the glyphs into a working file..."

  body: "heh, I don't know if it had an open contour, but I just deleted a glyph that
    I suspect was out of range and now I can generate a type 1. It just appears as
    \"untitled(type 1)\" in windows font viewer. Hooray for ongoing mysteries\r\n\r\nAdded
    later: Oh man. There was a space in the family name.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: '? - that''s strange, it''s the only thing I changed before the font name
    was able to show up in the preview window. I swear I remember reading somewhere
    that type 1 fonts won''t tolerate spaces in one of the name parameters. Of course,
    I''ve read so much about so many topics concerning fontlab that rather than knowing
    anything specific, I know great swaths of nothing.'
