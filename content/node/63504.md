  information in Adobe InDesign CS3 and CS4.\r\n\r\nWe put the ff ligature inside
  the same class as the lowercase f, but usually only the f will show kerning. This
  is only for the GPOS kern feature.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else come across this and found
  a solution?\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "@Jackson:\r\n\r\nNo -- you haven't been doing it wrong. I've run into the
    same problem. My less-than-ideal solution was to duplicate my case/small caps
    features as stylistic sets.\r\n\r\nI doubt that this is restricted to InDesign
    since most fonts lack uppercase \xDF, and since until recently there wasn't even
    a unicode value assigned to this character, apps wouldn't have had a way to even
    check for its presence in a font.\r\n\r\nNote also that the 'case' feature as
    described by adobe/microsoft doesn't actually change lowercase letters into uppercase
    -- it affects punctuation and figures. While I can't see any harm in also converting
    letters, applications can't rely on this feature to do so, so they must implement
    their own all-caps routine.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    target=\"_blank\">the Unicode site</a> which says:\r\n<cite>In contrast, standard
    German orthography uses the string \"SS\" as uppercase mapping for small sharp

  body: "If by 'correct behaviour', you mean 'correct behaviour for an application'
    I agree with you fully -- even if a capital eszett is present, the application
    should treat SS as the default uppercase form.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if by
    'correct behaviour', you mean 'correct behaviour for a font', I think this really
    would depend on the font. If one were to include a capital eszett in a text face,
    I'd think it would be wise to treat the uppercase form as a discretionary variant;
    in a display face, though, I'd think the designer could for some faces decide
    that the uppercase form is integral to the face and should be used as the default
    form.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is currently moot since there isn't any facility
    in place to allow a font to provide its own all-caps mapping, but I've wondered
    on various occasions why the 'case' feature wasn't defined in a way which allowed
    for this functionality (where an application would call the case feature to create
    all-caps if it was present and then use its own mechanism as a fall-back for fonts
    which didn't implement this feature).\r\n\r\nI've run into a few applications
    which handle all-caps correctly for common bicameral scripts (latin, greek, cyrillic),
    but which don't handle it at all for less common bicameral scripts (e.g. Armenian).
    If a way were provided for all-caps functionality to be provided by the font,
    this would provide a way for a font designer of less-common scripts to ensure
    that lowercase-to-uppercase mappings were performed correctly (here of course
    I'm envisioning a future in which all applications are OT-savvy) as well as a
    way for designers to devise their own solutions to 'problematic' characters like
    eszett.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "The quote from the Unicode site should make it clear that the application's
    casing is correct according to German orthography.\r\n\r\nIn your argument, InDesign's
    eszett casing which is <em>correct</em> according to German orthography and some
    applications' casing of other scripts which is <em>incorrect</em> according to
    the respective orthographies are treated as the same, which seems an odd way to
    make a point. Even more so since you suggest font-level (= <em>glyph-level</em>)
    fixes for what is an application-level (= <em>character-level</em>) operation:
    casing.\r\nConsequently if there were an option for eszett casing, this would
    be an application-level option too.\r\n\r\nEszett is not a problematic character
    and I wonder what makes you think it is. Referring to the Unicode link again:
    Correct casing is from eszett to two uppercase S. If a user wants to use the uppercase
    eszett, he needs to enter the according uppercase eszett <em>character</em> rather
    than perform a mere <em>glyph</em> substitution via OTL feature.\r\n"

  body: "Just to clarify, I wasn't so much trying to make a specific point as I was
    thinking out loud.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that \xDF is a problematic character, I should
    perhaps have been clearer: it is problematic in the sense that, unlike most other
    alphabetic characters, ToLower(ToUpper(X)) is not an identity function with respect
    to \xDF, which occasionally means that it needs to be treated as a special case
    in code (application or OpenType) which deals with case-relations.\r\n\r\nJust
    to do some more thinking out loud, the distinction between characters and glyphs
    is somewhat less than clear-cut, and an argument could be made that the distinction
    between upper and lowercase letters is somewhat intermediate between the two.
    There are cases where the two clearly function as different characters (e.g. in
    mathematical notions, or when used to identify (proper) names), but when all-caps
    is applied for stylistic purposes there is certainly a sense in which this is
    closer to a glyph-level operation than it is to a character-level one (which is
    why 'sub a by A' makes considerably more sense as a GSUB rule than, say 'sub a
    by b' does).\r\n\r\nAnd the contexts in which one applies all-caps are almost
    invariably those contexts in which caps serve a more stylistic than semantic function
    -- while I could see myself typing my name in and applying all-caps to it, I couldn't
    see myself setting it in lowercase and then applying all-caps to the first character.\r\n\r\nFor
    this reason, it doesn't seem entirely clear to me that all caps shouldn't be implemented
    as a glyph-level operation within a font.\r\n\r\nAs for the 'correct' uppercase
    of \xDF, I agree that SS is correct, but I disagree that this implies that for
    a font to use an uppercase form of \xDF (when such a form is part of the design)
    would be incorrect (which you do not say, but which you seem to be hinting at).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
