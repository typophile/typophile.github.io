  with a macron, such as \"Jun'ichir\u014D\". Unfortunately, Baskerville doesn't seem
  to offer this in the glyphs panel. Any suggestions/similar fonts with this diacritic?
  Thank you."

    it doesn't work perfectly, so it's better to check the availability of the needed
    characters using the preview text too."

  body: "Doesn't the font have a separate macron which you could just kern over the
    character(s) in question? That would be the best solution.\r\nIf you do use a
    different font, I'd advise to use it only for the macron, not the complete o-with-macron.
    (Edit: Or just switch to a different cut of Baskerville altogether that has everything
    you need \u2013 but that may not be an option.)"

  body: "It also depends on the nature and possible future use of the text in question.
    The kerned macron solution would be good just for printed matter.\r\nOne solution
    I have seen (but advise against) is replacing the macron with a circumflex."
