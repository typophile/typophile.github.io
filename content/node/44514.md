  MA priject and need a bitmap/pixel font that will fit perfectly into a square grid
  I have created for the designs (there are 60). I am using Crypt but this does not
  fit perfectly on the grid and i am going to have to create outlines and individually
  tweek it all which will take a long time. it needs to look perfect as this is about
  the pattern designs aesthetics rather the functionality of the piece.\r\n\r\nPlease
  please help. my deadline is looming and I would be eternally grateful!!\r\n\r\niz"

    had the sudden urge to Fontstruct. Sorry. This isn't on topic.
