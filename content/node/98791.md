    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/gill-new-antique/|Gill New Antique]] and
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aah-yes/langton/|Langton]]\r\nReminds me of [[http://typophile.com/node/70675|a
    previous discussion around Optima]]. Baker Sans would have been a great alternative
    too, some kind of contrasted version of Helvetica Extended."
