body: "Hey fellas!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019m writing something around
  here, even though I\u2019ve been following you for quite some time. And the reason
  I\u2019m writing is that I really need some help.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a graphic design
  student and currently an intern at the Marketing Department of the university I
  study in. I\u2019ve been assigned to redesign their brand guidelines, since the
  ones they have aren\u2019t that good.\r\n\r\nThe issue I\u2019m struggling with
  is that their primary typeface is Futura, but they don\u2019t have a secondary one.
  I want to define a serif typeface as secondary, you know, for the sake of contrast.
  This serif family would be used to set long texts, letters and other stuff like
  that. I am aware of Bringhurst\u2019s suggestion \u2013 to use a modern one, like
  Bodoni \u2013 but this combination looks too vanguardistic to me, as they define
  themselves as a regional, social institution.\r\n\r\nI was thinking in something
  more humanistic. Any suggestions on that? Oh, and it\u2019s not possible to change
  Futura, since they already are well known for it.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d really appreciate
  any help!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: Take a look at the Ikea catalogue, they pair Futura (or modified Futura) with
    a nice serif.

  body: "I think the serif in the IKEA catalog is Century Schoolbook and I find it
    does go very well with Futura. It takes up some of the geometrical simplicity
    while providing a pleasant contrast in rhythm...\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'd stay
    away from looking just like IKEA. It's such a well known contemporary design that
    people will notice and wonder why your university's design looks like a furniture
    catalog.\r\n\r\nMaybe Frutiger's \"Egyptienne F\" would be something... It has
    a lot of simplicity is more geometric than Century Schoolbook... I think this
    could work, what do you think? \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fe_4411.jpeg]"

    expanded look of Schoolbook. \r\n\r\nMaybe a separation between the text and header
    would mitigate the effect but it doesn't seem likely."

  body: "@ Nick Shinn: Well, thanks for the link. I really hadn\u2019t thought about
    that. Unfortunately, Brazilian typography never had that much tradition and it
    consists basically of display typefaces. The only decent serif I found was Adriane
    Text, by Marconi Lima and Silas Dilworth. I\u2019ll test it with Futura and I\u2019ll
    post my thoughts later.\r\n\r\n@ Artur and Lars: IKEA catalogs really look good,
    but I got to agree with Lars: it would look just like IKEA, and that\u2019s not
    what we\u2019re looking for. And even though I like the combination Futura/Egyptienne,
    I\u2019m not sure whether a slab serif typeface would suit the \u2018social institution\u2019
    image they\u2019re trying to pass. Or maybe I\u2019m wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks again,
    folks!"
