  when designing for print.\r\n\r\nOr is just me being OCD?"

    PDFs, copying a text where ligatures are applied as Ot features makes you obtain
    plain text (no ligatures).\r\nOf course if you hard-code a non-standard glyph
    into your text, you could have issues when copying it.\r\n"

    as a word, but may also decide to key it, character by character, into a browser
    field.\r\nFor that eventuality, don\u2019t complicate with a ligature, use discrete
    characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As a general rule I agree with Joe that ligatures should be avoided in email
    addresses and URLs. I think an exception is <em>possible</em> in the case of domains
    consisting of single, common words, presuming the text is appropriately spaced
    (always important when ligatures are involved). So, for example I think you can
    get away with <em>\uFB01ction.org,</em> but not <em>more\uFB01ction.org,</em>
    and definitely not <em>moreo\uFB03ction.org.</em>"

  body: "Thanks guys. I think I'm going to go with taking them out of every address.
    I understand what you're saying John about maybe getting away with common words
    in short emails, but then I think we'll get into the realms of um-ing and ah-ing
    over what is possible.\r\n\r\nWhat has really swayed me in the direction of being
    militant about no ligs is the fiftymilesofideas.ca web address Joe shared. I think
    even the jedis felt THAT disturbance!"
