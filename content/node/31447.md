  the cover of a new Typotheque catalogue we are looking for a girl / woman named
  Greta. Not Margaret, not Greet, but really Greta. We would like to photograph her
  in our studio, for which we offer a modest fee: cover the costs of transportation
  to The Hague, NL*; offer 2 books of choice, and 2 t-shirts of choice from our collection.
  Additionally you'll get a free license of our upcoming font Greta.\r\n\r\nPlease
  let Greta know.\r\n\r\nHow to proceed: please contact peter at typotheque dot com,
  and send your ID with the full name. We'll then plan the details.\r\n\r\n* only
  available for European travel\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/site/font_in_development.php?id=54/\">http://www.typotheque.com/site/font_in_development.php?id=54/</a>\r\n<a

    with you? Ha. \r\n\r\nHer hair is red and she is wonderful, as you can only imagine!\r\n\r\nHope
    you are well and send me an email if there is interest. I need to talk to you
    about some business too."
