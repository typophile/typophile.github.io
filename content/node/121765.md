  body: "This automobile emblem for the REO Motor Car Company http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Motor_Car_Company
    dates from before WW I. In use on a 1906 model:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReoRunabout1906Detail_5116.jpg]
    \ In use on a 1913  model: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reo1913Detail_4172.jpg]
    It is not taken directly from a font.\r\nFor fonts with similar styles you could
    look at the offerings of Greater Albion Typefounders https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater_Albion_Typefounders/\r\nDon"
