    <BR> <BR>You might try DustBust... <BR> <BR><a href="http://w1.192.telia.com/~u19212831/"
    target="_blank">http://w1.192.telia.com/~u19212831/</a> <BR> <BR>Looks like a
    few similar ones there. <BR> <BR>Probably some pay fonts like this, too, <BR>but
    I can&#39;t think of any offhand. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>

  body: Is anyone ever curious what becomes of these IDs on the other end? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    just curious some times, what are the ID-getters doing <BR>with the fonts they
    need identified. <BR> <BR>Anybody else? <BR> <BR>not that it&#39;s a bad diversion
    on a Friday. <BR> <BR>bjork

  body: 'In my case, I am a book designer. I work for a dozen or so publishers in
    NY, Boston and SF. Very often an editor or art director will send a jpeg of some
    book saying, &#34;we like this font&#34; but often they don&#39;t know what it
    is. In other cases I see something I think will come in useful and this is just
    a great way to find out. So that&#39;s what happens at my end. PS: I wanted to
    post an image by my name but I don&#39;t know how.'

  body: Melanie, sorry, I was thinking out loud, randomly, in this thread.  <BR>If
    I remember correctly, <BR>you said in another thread that you were a book designer.
    <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; do you mean - what if....the client is going to find out that....
    <BR> the boy/girl... that he&#39;s going to pay.....dosen&#39;t......  <BR> <BR>I
    just am curious about some of the fonts, what they are being used for, etc.  <BR>Especially,
    when there&#39;s really strange stuff sometimes. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not interested
    necessarily in whether they are free or pay, whether there are <BR>clients involved
    or not....just wondering what the font is gonna be <BR>doing later in life. <BR>
    <BR>oh well, never mind. <BR> <BR>But Jared, you do have some explaining to do.
    <BR> <BR>What&#39;s with all the posts today? <BR> <BR>curious george <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve seen the &#39;Africa&#39; before, but I can&#39;t remember if it
    was <BR>from that very sample or the font that made up the sample. <BR>In any
    case, it reminds me of the <a href="http://www.thefoundrystudio.co.uk/" target="_blank">Architype</a>
    stuff The <BR>Foundry swiped from some of the bauhaus masters.

  body: Melanie, <BR> <BR>Sometimes I see my stuff here - and how other people trying
    to find out &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34;. Not everyting is a typeface/font. And
    if yes - not for sell. since of the contract with the client &#40;I&#39;m not
    talking about &#34;africa&#34;&#41;. And yes I wonder &#34;why they are looking
    for that typeface/lettering?&#34; <BR> <BR>Good day <BR> <BR>
