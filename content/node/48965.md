  very soon and I am looking for Letterhead etc.\r\n\r\nThe shop was built in the
  15th Century, so I thought that a font which matched the building would be a good
  idea to reinforce the character etc.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I am totally ignorant
  of 15th Century fonts. Are they available etc?\r\n\r\nAlso if I buy a font, I assume
  that I load the software and set it as me default font etc.However, will people
  be able to read emails written in the font etc?\r\n\r\nI do apologise for the naivety
  of my questions, but any help would be gratefully received.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\nThe font would be used on signage, hand painted and suitable large.
  It would also be used for Word documents, emails and newspaper adverts etc. "

    on the styles of the 16th century (and further). You can then go to [[http://www.myfonts.com/|Myfonts]]
    and search for those styles.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are a number of styles
    to choose from. You should probably narrow down the region/country of origin of
    the typeface to something that fits. Another consideration is that the styles
    in the timeline are all text faces from book printing applications. Popular signage/lettering
    from the era you'll have to Google for. Thirdly there are the many styles of handwriting
    from that period, that all carry special connotations. They divide into geographical
    areas, periods, fashions, occasions, and some are used specifically by some governments/regencies."

  body: You should possibly consider that your average customer is not going to be
    aware that your timeline in font matches. The fact that you found it necessary
    to ask here would indicate that. They may get that feeling somewhat if you use
    something that looks like an antique Roman or simple Blackletter. Tiffany's link
    seems like a good bet to me because its both a historic and elegant solution.
    Just be sure not to use something like a Bastarda for long text settings. Also,
    as Nick pointed out, some historic letters (such as long s) may be difficult for
    your customers to read.

    typography. Many old style Roman types have origins that go back that far. Then
    there are antique versions of these that mimic early printing methods. I just
    thought since 15c would encompass a large chunk of time both typographicly and
    calligraphicly  there would be a lot of room for interpretaion. Perhaps the surrounding
    architecture might help play a role in choosing a more specific type. Not being
    versed in type history like many folks here I would hesitate to offer a specific
    font, but would reccommend using something thats not cliche.\r\n\r\nOf course

  body: "Many thanks for you responses. \r\n\r\nI do think that it is worthwhile to
    get a font as close to the Fifteenth Century as I can. Close is the operable word,
    in that it does not have to be an exact font from the period, but it should compliment
    the building \r\n\r\nI am getting closer now, even if it is just knowing what
    I do not want.\r\n\r\nI know that I do not want the flowery (is it Bastarda?)
    type fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I intend to use it for Letterheads, Business Cards,
    Gift Vouchers, Posters/leaflets in the shop, and Shop Signage, I know it needs
    to be scalable, down to Business Card size.\r\n\r\nThere does appear to be one
    other common problem. Postcodes look decidedly odd in such fonts, as numbers are
    the same size as Lowercase letters. Is it possible to just increase the font size
    for them to be a similar size to Uppercase letters?\r\n\r\nMorris Golden matched
    all my requirements, I think, except it failed the postcode test. \r\n\r\nAny
    more ideas/contributions are gratefully received.\r\n\r\n(Edits added below)\r\n\r\nI

  body: I think you really need two fonts that work together. One bears most of the
    burden of conveying the character you intend, and the other bears most of the
    burden of readable communication. The font used for the company name on the letterhead
    shouldn't in this case be the same one in which that the letter itself is set.
    Look at the [[http://typophile.com/node/49157|beer label thread]] - most of those
    don't use the same blackletter or script in the brandname for the smaller and
    longer texts describing the beer, brewery location, ingredients, etc.

  body: "It depends on the face and the layout software you have. If you get a standard-issue
    regular-set PostScript face, it will only contain one type of figure style, and
    will not contain small caps. These character sets usually contain only tabular
    lining figures, meaning all of the number have the same space around them and
    are all about cap-height. The numbers 1 and 0 usually look awful in this setting.
    The problem is that in this older format (and TrueType shares this difficulty)
    is that there are only 215 slots for various characters (glyphs) - not nearly
    enough for good typographic design. So the PostScript-format faces got around
    this by having supplementary set - 'expert' sets - that would contain small caps
    or text figures - anything that was lacking in the regular set. \r\n\r\nThere's
    a newer format called OpenType where all of these characters (or glyphs) are in
    one typeface. This format I think can handle 12,000 characters, so there's more
    than enough room. Not all faces use all of the possible features, so you need
    to examine the manufacturer's description carefully. Generally if it's called
    'OpenType Pro' you'll get complete typographic support. Contact the seller directly,
    if in doubt.\r\n\r\nBUT to access these characters you need a layout program that
    can us the font properly. InDesign can, and I think that Illustrator CS2 or later
    can as well. I'm unclear about Quark as the last time I checked they were still
    accessing only the first 256 characters of an OpenType font. Doubtless this has
    changed, but you'll need to have an up-to-date version. While MS Word can read
    and use OpenType fonts it cannot (it seems) access any special features, such
    as small caps. It can use any multi-lingual features (such as Greek or Arabic
    characters in the typeface), but then that's not what you need here.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps."
