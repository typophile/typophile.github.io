  body: Sergio, looking at it for the first time, if I were uneducated in design,
    except for the third one, it reads UN not UA. I Also feel you need to use a different
    font for the type under 25 its very difficult to read. Also unless its only to
    be used in a huge size you need to use the dark red or blue type on the small
    type. Remember not all the readers  are going to be 18 to 30 year olds. Dan

  body: The type at the bottom is too thin. Wouldn&#39;t it be more interesting to
    use something which contrasts with your top type? Very nice colors though. I think
    the combo on the far left or far right is best. The Red and Yellow seem to be
    the same tone at least closer than are the blue and yellow.
