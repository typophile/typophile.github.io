body: "Dear forum members,\r\n\r\nI was just wondering what others think about this:\r\n\r\nWhen
  working on your typefaces, are you listening to music (or not)?\r\nDoes it influence
  the work?\r\nIs it distracting or beneficial?\r\nWhat kind of music do you listen
  to?\r\nIs it different from your usual listening habits?\r\nIn what phase of design
  do you listen to music (or not): conception/drawing, elaboration, programming/production,
  marketing?\r\nAre there any other aspects I forgot to ask?\r\n\r\nFor me, i listen
  to music in elaboration process and marketing, and I usually choose more or less
  meditative stuff like Sigur R\xF3s, Kraftwerk, M\xFAm, Kante (german band), Django
  Rheinhard or sometimes even Einst\xFCrzende Neubauten (later phase), The White Stripes
  and Tool. Criteria is that it works \"in background\", and I don't have to concentrate
  on structur or text of the music necessarely, but can concentrate on the letters.\r\nThis
  kind of music is part of my usual listening habit, but there are much more other
  bands and genres I listen to when not working on fonts.\r\nMaybe I should try what
  happens if I listen to something in the conceptional phase of a design; until now
  I don't think there has been influence on the design because of listening to music
  besides.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your thoughts\r\nSebilar"

  body: "Great question Sebilar! I am always anxious to know what people are listening
    to, in general. Personally, I love to listen to music while I work and design
    (and admittedly, I have never designed a full out typeface although I have lots
    of designs in progress). When I have to do grunt/production work, I tend to listen
    to Rock music - something with a heavy beat. It seems to help me concentrate on
    the tasks at hand and puts me into a regimented, structured frame of mind. When
    I am creating and sketching and ideating, I tend to listen to lighter music: anything
    from classical to jazz to pop music.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of music, this question reminds
    me of something I read in Heller's book: The Education of a Typographer. It had
    to do with music and keeping an open mind and I think it was written by Terry
    Irwin. \"Josef M\xFCeller-Brockmann said he believed that, as we get older, our
    scope of acceptability narrows \u2014 it is simply human nature. But, he maintained,
    as designers, we must resist this at all costs, lest it handicap us as professional
    communicators. He described how each day, he would take some time to put on his
    Walkman and listen to rap music because he absolutely hated it. He wanted to keep
    looking at what was new and fresh out in the world and remain willing to step
    out of his comfort zone.\""

  body: I listen to music as much as possible during the day. It definitely helps
    my work flow smoothly. The choice of music is based solely on my mood at the time.
    Sometimes I feel like some Wu-tang or MF Doom, other times it is Erik Satie or
    Mozart. I do find that I have to choose the right music for my mood or my attention
    span and concentration suffers.

    not listen while I worked.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I'm with Chris - if I listen to music at all while I design it has to have
    no words. However when I paint I listen to music all the time, or talk radio.

  body: 'I won''t put on music when I start work, but sometimes I''ll get a feeling
    in the midst of working that there should be some music. I don''t think there
    is a connection between the music I choose and the work I am doing: usually it
    is just whatever music I feel like listening to or, quite often, a recent CD purchase
    that I''m ''learning''. In rotation at the moment are two recordings by Ensemble
    Organum of early Roman liturgical chant.'
