  body: "You got me curious. On http://www.fontlab.com/eula/ I read:\r\n<blockquote>
    You may ... Transfer the program and license to another party if the other party
    agrees to accept the terms and conditions of this license agreement. If you transfer
    the program you must at the same time transfer the software manual and either
    transfer all copies (whether imprinted or machine readable form) to the same party
    or destroy any copies not transferred. This includes all modifications and portions
    of the program contained or merged into other programs. </blockquote>\r\nI must
    be missing something."
