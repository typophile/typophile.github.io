    Paradox</a>. I knew it was either Smeijers or Unger.

  body: Interesting. I am really struggling to find the differences between Coranto
    and Paradox. Can you enlighten me, Ben? Perhaps a name change? Paradox seems to
    be a newer release.

  body: <em>I.D.</em>'s font has the 'g' with a flatter bowl and a larger x-height,
    so it must be Coranto.
