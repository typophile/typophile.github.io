body: "I have a problem regarding software and font recognition. I work at a small
  newspaper and we are in the midst of a redesign. This involves using new fonts,
  obviously. One we have chosen is Bodoni SvtyTwo ITC-TT. We use macs to design the
  paper each night. No problems there ... these are fonts that have been in our system
  for years. However, our plate-making software (called Asura) is a PC based software
  and we have been told by Asura that the Bodoni that we are using is a 'mac font.'
  I was always under the impression that fonts are fonts. How do we troubleshoot this
  as far as what kind of font we have in our system? Is there a certain file extension
  that would tell us exactly which font we have and what it is compatable with? Also,
  can we just buy a brand new version of the font that would be usable on both the
  Asura server and our macs? If so, what do we need to keep in mind when purchasing
  it?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help in advance. I love the site but this is my
  first time in the forums. I can provide any other sort of info if I need to. As
  a copy-editor, this is really above my head (and paygrade, lol.)"

    as part of either iLife or AppleWorks (on older systems), then it is indeed Mac
    only since it is a font suitcase. You'll be able to find cross-platform versions
    (i.e. OpenType) from all the usual sources, for example:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/618096/itcbodoni-clan.html?q=&subviewmode=PACKAGES&pid=listview&page=0&pagesize=50\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "A quick addendum: for mac-only fonts the file extension won't be helpful
    since it isn't required, though anything ending in .suit is almost certainly mac
    only. Fonts ending in either .ttf (TrueType/TrueType-Flavoured OpenType) or .otf
    \ (CFF/Postscript-Flavoured OpenType) should be cross-platform.\r\n\r\nYour better
    bet, though, is to use the Finder's 'Get info' command and look at the first line
    of info (Kind). You'll want something which says either 'Windows TrueType font'
    or 'OpenType font'. If it says 'Font Suitcase' it won't work on a PC.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
