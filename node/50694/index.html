  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was looking around at the websites of typographers earlier today, and came across the site of one independent designer (whom I shall not name) which looked so broken on my computer I had to email him and explain what was wrong with his HTML and CSS, and how standards-compliant coding practices would rectify them. I am a professional web developer and like to educate others about web standards and accessibility, to help improve the web in my own little way. The response I got back, however, shocked me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are all visual problems caused by your settings. The site was meant to be viewed the way I designed it. I won&rsquo;t tailor the site to meet every possible variable of every combination of browser customizations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My &lsquo;settings and customisations&rsquo; were choosing a preferred font other than Times, increasing the minimum font size, and increasing the line height in my browser&rsquo;s preferences. This is so that I do not encounter illegible text. I am short-sighted, and my sight gets worse later in the day when my eyes tire or I start to slouch.
These are standard preferences that every browser has available, and I know most people who care about type aesthetics (i.e. the design‐orientated folks likely to his web site) will set such preferences to their liking.</p>
<p>There is no need to specifically code to &ldquo;meet every possible variable&rdquo;, by using a flexible layout, and realising that the web is not the printed page—you do not have absolute control over how your site looks on your visitors machines—you can produce a site that looks great on everyone&rsquo;s screen, regardless of their preferred font size.</p>
<p>I reminded him that the only computer on which his site can &ldquo;be viewed the way he designed it&rdquo; was his own. I will no longer be recommending this designer to my clients. I hope the people coming to this forum are not as narrow minded.</p>

<p>If the unnamed designer is claiming to be a Web designer then they should value your feedback.</p>
<p>If however they are licensing fonts to companies or graphic designers then having a rubbish web site won&rsquo;t hold them back - especially if they use distributors to interface directly with the paying customers. A good example of someone not held back&hellip; <a href="http://www.carterandcone.com/">http://www.carterandcone.com/</a></p>

<p>This is why a lot of architects, photographers, etc sites have really crappy web sites. It&rsquo;s in the nature of a visual designer to want to have control and it&rsquo;s hard to let that go when putting yourself online.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with everything that has been said. I&rsquo;m not a web designer, but I do try to educate myself concerning best web practices and standards. I&rsquo;m not even a real graphic designer. I&rsquo;m more of an enthusiast. But when it comes to the internet, I applaud most attempts to make the web look more like print if they end up being accessible too. A good example would be [[http://www.jasonsantamaria.com|Jason Santa Maria]].</p>
<p>All of this brings me to my point: I dislike the idea of overriding the font choices consciously (and hopefully wisely) made by the designer of the site with your preferred setting. While that might not be a problem in fluid layouts (which almost invariably look awful), it can be with a fixed layout. I myself &ldquo;care about type aesthetics&rdquo; and that is why I never change the browser&rsquo;s viewing preferences to my liking because I want to view the site the way the designer intended. He chose, per se, Georgia over Verdana, because that&rsquo;s what compliments his layout and design best.</p>
<p>Let me add a disclaimer, Nick, in that your short-sightedness warrants tampering with these settings, but wouldn&rsquo;t Ctrl+scroll do enough while, at the same time, &ldquo;preserving&rdquo; the design? I&rsquo;d find the web to be extremely bland were it set in just Verdana (or Arial!)&hellip; It&rsquo;s an interesting topic nonetheless, so if anyone cares to share their opinion, please do.</p>
