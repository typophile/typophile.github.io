    der Waarde a while back: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Telefont.gif"
    target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Telefont.gif</a> <BR> <BR>You
    can also see Telefont in the book &#34;Haagse Letters&#34;. <BR> <BR>Also: <BR>Apparently
    there was coverage of it in an issue of &#34;Typographic&#34; by the Society of
    Typographic Designers: issue 38-39, Spring/Summer 1990. This issue also covers
    three other phone book typefaces: Colin Banks about the British books, Jolijn
    van de Wouw about the Dutch books &#40;1980s&#41;, and Ian McLaren about the French
    telephone book on Viditel &#40;a precursor of the web&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>To
    me, Telefont is a nice design &#40;except for that frivolous &#34;f&#34;&#41;,
    but it&#39;s missing trapping. <BR>The explanation I&#39;ve heard of why that&#39;s
    the case is that it was a rush job. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    Martin he was handing out actual pages torn out of the phone book  <BR>as a promotion
    for the face. Which was pretty cool. I still must have mine somewhere  <BR>in
    my archives. Though I like the face, I agree about the trapping Hrant.
