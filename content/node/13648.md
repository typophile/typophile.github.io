body: "The apotheosis of the proof press, Vandercooks (specifically the SP-15 and
  Universal models) provide consistent inking and [[impression]] and a large bed and
  are notoriously easy to clean, adjust and operate. They are also tremendously difficult
  to damage or move (bend at the knees, bring 4 strong friends). They are excellent
  for making prints from lino and [[woodcuts]] as well as metal and wood type, [[photopolymer]],
  [[engravings]] and anything else [[type high]].\r\n\r\n[[Joshua Lurie-Terrell]]
  has an <a href=\"http://www.ryerson.ca/~ibaitz/gal_proofpr.htm\">SP-15</a> in his
  garage and really needs to use it more often."
