  body: 'Hopefully you will get some Israeli comment, but it really depends on the
    purpose to which the font will be put. I am not expert on this, but here is what
    I know. <BR> <BR>Israelis generally don&#39;t use the points or &#39;nikud&#39;,
    though they will use the &#39;additional&#39; punctuation, hash marks which are
    attached to Hebrew letters to indicate the soft g and ch sounds in foreign names
    &#40;Charlie, George&#41;. But once in a while Israelis will throw in a vowel
    point to resolve ambiguity, so probably it is best to have the full set of vowels.  <BR>
    <BR>The cantillation marks are only for the editions of the Bible used as a guide
    for chanting the text - a very specialized use.  <BR> <BR>The Yiddish combinations
    are not required in regular Hebrew [Yiddish is a German dialect written in Hebrew
    characters]. Yiddish is still alive, but has few speakers; you can get a keyboard
    mapping just for Yiddish which uses the combination letters, I believe.  <BR>
    <BR>For outside Israel you would definitely need the regular vowel points, but
    for inside you might get away without, though you&#39;d have to ask Israelis.
    I would guess that few Hebrew fonts have cantillation marks available.  <BR> <BR>There
    is a problem with spacing the vowel points in a fully voweled text. Some of the
    Hebrew composition programs for use outside Israel advertise that they have special
    software to deal with this. '

  body: 'Those are listed as 05F3 and 05F4. If I remember right the single hash mark
    is put after a gimmel to get the soft g and the double hash after a tzadi to get
    a CH.  <BR> <BR>About how good Open Type and kerning deal with the problem I don&#39;t
    know. I believe that Israelis can&#39;t be bothered with the problem, as they
    rarely use the vowel points. John Hudson did an open type Hebrew font with both
    vowels and cantillation marks, so he will know all this very well. I think Davka
    &#40;davka.com&#41; claims their vowelling is better placed, but I don&#39;t know.
    You could always call them.  '

    it contains just the whole alphabet, the Israeli currency mark, and basic punctuation,

    05F4 hash marks. <BR>I recall Oded told me nowadays cantillation marks are of
    very limited use within Israel &#40;proof is his fonts does not contain them&#41;.

  body: 'There are basically four typical ways to write Hebrew today &#40;I say &#39;typical&#39;
    because one sometimes finds partially vocalised texts that include occasional
    nikud&#41;: <BR> <BR>1. Totally unmarked: letters only. <BR> <BR>2. Only consonant
    markers indicated: shin dot U&#43;05C1; sin dot U&#43;05C2; dagesh U&#43;05BC;
    rafe U&#43;05BF. Note that not all consonant marks may be used, or may be used
    only when necessary to distinguish ambiguous words. For example, one might see
    documents that only mark the sin dot. <BR> <BR>3. Full vocalisation: all nikud
    &#40;vowels&#41; and consonant markers as above. Most of the nikud are centered
    under the consonant or, in the case of the right-leg consonants like dalet and
    resh, under the right side. An important exception is the holam, which sits at
    the top left of the consonant in most cases. Note that the position and behaviour
    of holam varies in modern Hebrew and many Bible editions. In modern Hebrew typesetting
    the holam sits slightly to the left of the letter, between it and the next letter.
    In many Bible editions the holam sits above the left edge of the letter but, importantly,
    may contextually move further to the left in some circumstances, e.g. when followed
    by an unvocalised alef. The OTL lookups for Biblical holam are a pain in the neck.
    <BR> <BR>4. Full vocalisation and accentuation: all nikud and consonant markers
    plus all te&#39;amin &#40;cantillation marks&#41;. This is used only for the Biblical
    text; to my knowledge, te&#39;amin never occur in any text except the Bible. Te&#39;amin
    interract contextually with the nikud and with each other and this, among other
    things, drastically slows the rendering time of a Biblical Hebrew font. Although
    many Hebrew-speakers will tell you there is no significant difference between
    the Biblical and modern Hebrew language, there are some typographic difference
    &#40;e.g. the position of holam mentioned above&#41; and I&#39;m inclined to ship
    a stripped-down version of my Biblical Hebrew font for modern Hebrew users simply
    so they will have something that doesn&#39;t have to go through dozens of OTL
    lookups for things they don&#39;t need like te&#39;amin interraction. <BR> <BR>In
    addition to the consonant markers, nikud and te&#39;amin, there are a few odds
    and ends in the Unicode Hebrew block. The paseq mark &#40;U&#43;05C0&#41; is used
    as part of accentuation in the Biblical text, but it also appears in the Microsoft
    8-bit Hebrew codepage, which suggests that it might have some use in modern Hebrew.
    The Yiddish digraphs that William mentioned may be encoded using the precomposed
    characters or sequences of regular Hebrew letters; I understand that there is
    actually divergent practice between different Yiddish user communities. Also,
    some of the precomposed alef&#43;nikud combinations in the Unicode Alphabetic
    Presenation Forms block are used as vowels in Yiddish, so should probably be included
    in any font intended to support that language, even though they may be encoded
    as sequences of letter and mark. <BR> <BR>Modern Hebrew punctuation uses most
    of the typical Latin set: comma, period, semicolon, etc. including parentheses,
    brackets and braces. I&#39;m not 100% sure what the standard for quotation marks
    is. Note that unlike Arabic, Hebrew does not use a horizontally-flipped, right-to-left
    question mark; I know one Israeli type designer who thinks they should, but he
    has not convinced his colleagues or typical users. <BR> <BR>My recommendation
    is that a font for modern Hebrew should support everything that is in the Microsoft
    1255 Hebrew codepage.'

  body: I believe John&#39;s post has cleared up the matter almost fully, so I would
    simply like to answer Hrant&#39;s query from an Israeli point of view. <BR> <BR>Nikud
    &#40;vocalization marks&#41; is indeed rare in modern Hebrew, therefore fonts
    that that are not considered to be &#34;text&#34; faces, meaning they would not
    accomodate long passages of text, usually include the Hebrew letters only &#40;05D0-05EA&#41;,
    no Nikud. <BR> <BR>A good Hebrew text face, though, has a full set of Nikud &#40;starting
    05B0&#41; as well as the letters. <BR> <BR>I think new Hebrew foundries &#40;like
    Oded Ezer&#39;s&#41; add Nikud to almost all their faces, both text and display
    - a blessed habit. <BR> <BR>The Yiddish vowel pairs double-Vav, Vav-Yod and Double-Yod
    &#40;05F0-05F2&#41; are rarely included. <BR> <BR>Quotation marks are almost always
    &#34;typewriter&#34; style &#40;05F3-05F4&#41; and should be included in all Hebrew
    faces &#40;there is very wide use of them, especially since the Geresh &#39; mark
    is used as an abbriviation mark for the likes of Prof. and Capt. and the Gershayim
    &#34; is used for the likes of Dr and Mr&#41;. <BR> <BR>The hebrew hyphen used
    for word-connection is called Maqaf &#40;05BE&#41; and should also be included
    with every Hebrew font. <BR> <BR>Sof pasuq &#40;05C3&#41; is literally a colon
    &#40;it&#39;s used in bibilical publications to note where verses end&#41;, it
    can be a direct link to the colon glyph. <BR> <BR>The Rafe &#40;05BF&#41; and
    Paseq &#40;05C0&#41; aren&#39;t normally used in everyday Hebrew. Also, I have
    no idea what the Upper Dot &#40;05C4&#41; means, maybe it&#39;s a version of the
    Holam &#40;05B9&#41; mark? &#40;John? William? Anyone?&#41; <BR> <BR>If you add
    Nikud to a Hebrew font, you should also add the Hebrew portion of the Alphabetic
    Presentation Forms table &#40;the wide letters and the Yiddish and Ladino ligatures
    are only an option, though&#41;. Notice there&#39;s also a special Jewish &#34;plus&#34;
    sign for Hebrew &#40;to counter the &#34;christian&#34;, cross-like plus&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Basic punctuation like commas, periods, and exclamation and question
    marks are generally the same as in Latin faces. <BR> <BR>Some classic designs
    favor the shape of a diamond for the periods and other points, but I think you
    have that in some English faces as well, don&#39;t you? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious
    as to the identity of the Israeli type designer who thinks Hebrew should use Arabic
    question marks. <BR> <BR>Former prime minister, Yitzhak Ben-Tzvi once motioned
    to add two Hebrew letters &#40;Alef-like and He-like&#41; to replace vocalization
    marks. Debates continue to this very day, in various forums. <BR>

    mark?</i> <BR> <BR>This I can answer authoritatively, having discussed the matter
    at length on the Unicode Hebrew list with a member of the Israeli standardisation
    body. I&#39;d originally guessed that U&#43;05C4 was the Hebrew number mark, but
    it is actually intended as the upper <i>punctum extraordinarium</i> -- sorry,
    I don&#39;t know what the Jewish name is -- which appears only in the Biblical
    text and only a very small number of times. Scholars disagree about its meaning,
    but it is clearly very important because it even occurs in some Torah scrolls,
    which do not include nikud or te&#39;amin &#40;excuse my Aramaic: it&#39;s what
    I&#39;m used to&#41;. There is also a lower punctum, which occurs only three times
    in the Bible text, all on one word, in Psalm 27:13, but the Israeli standards
    body didn&#39;t bother to propose this for encoding because it was so rare. I&#39;m
    not sure what they thought scholars were supposed to do without it! It has now
    been proposed for addition to the Unicode Hebrew block &#40;along with the almost
    equally rare <i>nun hafukah</i>&#41;. Here is an image of the first word in the
    13th verse of Psalm 27. The large dots above and below are the puncta; the form
    shown for U&#43;05C4 in the Unicode book is misleading. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/28377.gif"

    presentation forms also include the alef-lamed ligature. This is not used for
    the Biblical text&#42;, but is sometimes encountered in other religious books
    such prayer books, and in a variety of other Hebrew texts from the 7th century
    on &#40;the earliest dated manuscript containing this ligature was found in the
    Cairo Genizah; sorry, I can&#39;t remember the date&#41;. I recently did some
    research on this ligature, and discovered its early history as record by Solomon
    Birnbaum in <i>The Hebrew Scripts</i>, Brill 1971, p.226. It originated among
    speakers of Judaeo-Arabic following the Moslem conquests. The sequence alef&#43;lamed
    is incredibly common in Arabic because it is the definite article <i>&#39;al</i>,
    and the ligature was originally developed specifically to write this word. It&#39;s
    use was later extended to every occurence of the sequence in Judaeo-Arabic, and
    gradually found its way into use in Hebrew. I&#39;d be interested to know to what
    extent it is used in modern Israel and in what kinds of texts. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Although the alef-lamed ligature is not normally used for the Biblical text, whether
    in scroll or book form, Moses Gaster notes that one book manuscript in his collection
    does include &#39;ligatures formed by the joining of two letters&#39;, which I&#39;m
    guessing refers to the alef-lamed ligature. This is part of a discussion of the
    relative liberality shown in the writing of Bibles &#40;books&#41; as opposed
    to the sacred Torah scrolls. [<i>The Tittled Bible.</i> Maggs Bros 1929. p.7]&#60;/font&#62;'

    <BR> <BR>&#34;Westernization&#34; of semitic typefaces is inevitable, much like

    interesting, though, to see how the local folk of each culture take those incredibly
    imperialistic elements and make them their own. Seldom, the result of such fusion
    can even do as much as redefine aesthetics, both locally and globally.'

    in Hebrew... Peace out. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.exego.net/specials/type/1078.asp"

  body: 'Some of the most creative advances in civilization have come from culture
    clash - or so argued my late teacher Karl Popper in &#39;The Open Society and
    Its Enemies&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Of course, some of the most stupid and ugly things
    can also come of cultural clash! So the issue is not whether there is influence,
    but how creatively it is done. Do you get something new and good, or worse or
    just ridiculous?  <BR> <BR>In the case of Hebrew script, it was already &#39;Easternized&#39;
    once. The &#39;Hebrew&#39; characters are not Hebrew at all, but Aramaic. In the
    Talmud I believe they are called &#39;Chaldean&#39;. The ancient Hebrew script
    was gradually replaced by the Aramaic script after the Babylonian exile in the
    fifth century B.C.E. [Aramaic was the language of Babylon and became the common
    language of the whole near east.]  <BR> <BR>By the way, Meir, do they ever use
    the ancient Hebrew script on stamps or coins today in Israel? '

  body: '&#62; the first thing would be the shape of the Hebrew letter <BR> <BR>But
    there&#39;s something else. <BR>It&#39;s not just the abstract structure of individual
    letters than must be taken into account, it&#39;s how they come together to form
    optimal boumas &#40;word shapes&#41;. This is why there&#39;s a difference between
    display and text type. A lack of sensitivity to this is the reason 99% of non-Latin
    type performs worse than their Latin counterparts. You cannot enforce formal congruence
    &#40;for example in modularity and vertical proportions&#41; without a loss in
    functionality. <BR> <BR>If you look at the Cyrillic Meta sample on that page of
    mine, you will see that it&#39;s way too similar to the Latin. Imagine it without
    those &#40;nominally extraneous&#41; parentheses, and you&#39;ll see how it seriously
    confuses reading. <BR> <BR>&#62; <a href="http://www.exego.net/specials/type/1078.asp"

    abi-Fares in the current issue of Baseline magazine &#40;#43&#41;. But to me the
    main thing it shows is how far non-chirographic Arabic type has to go... <BR>

  body: Addressing John&#39;s ponder, I don&#39;t think there is any use to the Alef-Lamed
    ligature in modern Hebrew. I&#39;ve only seen it in very few prayer books. <BR>
    <BR>Hrant - I&#39;d love having that interview translated, I think it has many
    useful points of information for starter as well as intermediate type designers
    and enthusiasts. I&#39;ll keep you in mind... :&#62; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to
    show off some Hebrew bitmap work of mine in the Critique section, with regards
    to John&#39;s post here about including consonant marks only &#40;which is what
    I&#39;m doing in that font&#41;. <BR>

    don&#39;t trust me!&#41; to post later on a scan of the eye page with the Abbar
    typeface sample. That coin is so cool!

    sure I&#39;ll forget to scan the Abbar sample for you. And, yes, Oded added a
    limited set of nikud to updated versions of Alchemy and his other faces.
