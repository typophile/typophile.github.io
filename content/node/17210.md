  a canned paragraph, but it's followed by\r\nsome dynamically-generated text, rendered\r\non-the-fly
  certainly.\r\n\r\nI assume this is to prevent textual copying by\r\nrobots (or just
  by humans). Anyway, not that the\r\nrendering is very good (the JPEG haloing for
  one\r\nis pretty bad) but I'm curious as to the mechanics\r\nof this. What kind
  of font, and software?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The simplest cross-platform way to something like that would be to use <a
    href=\"http://freetype.sourceforge.net/\">FreeType</a>, possibly in conjuction
    with an image manipulation library such as the one that comes with <a href=\"http://www.imagemagick.org/\">ImageMagick</a>.\r\n\r\nI've
    used FreeType in the past to write a full-fledged text renderer for the <a href=\"http://www.tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>
    Series 1 platform. My application took arbitrary input text and presented it in
    a \"dialog box\" on the user's TV screen. Here's a screen shot:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/messagebox.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    had to implement some of the fancy stuff (such as word wrap, kerning, and input
    text parsing) myself; fortunately, FreeType makes all the necessary metrics available
    to the programmer. Some of the hardest parts -- parsing the TrueType files, and
    rendering the actual glyphs -- are done by FreeType itself.\r\n\r\nRegister.com's
    use of JPEG compression instead of PNG or GIF is just silly. Saving the rendered
    image to a proper PNG file can be done pretty simply by using <a href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html\">libpng</a>."

  body: "Cool - and thanks!\r\n\r\nEdward, if I send you a \"special\" TrueType font,
    one that renders out\r\ngrayscale bitmaps, would you be willing to test it with
    your setup?\r\nFor one thing I think you might be impressed with the rendering\r\nquality
    of handmade gs bitmaps - but mostly I'd like to test it, and\r\nmaybe even have
    a showcase for it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'd be happy to test your TrueType font on my TiVo setup if you want. I've
    actually been following some of your progress, and I've been looking forward to
    seeing the results in action.\r\n\r\nNote that at the glyph level, the output
    will essentially be the output of the FreeType rasterizer.\r\n\r\nThe FreeType
    rasterizer has many internal options that can be tweaked; for my specific application,
    I spent a lot of time experimenting in order to determine out the combination
    of options that best approximated the text rendering of the native TiVo software
    (which, by the way, is probably using FreeType itself). My goal was seamlessness
    rather than optimal subjective rendering quality. That's the reason that, for
    example, the tracking is too tight (in my opinion).\r\n\r\nTherefore, if I test
    your font under that particular setup, it may not look as good as it possibly
    can. Additionally: I'm not sure what you mean when you say that your TrueType
    font is \"special\", but if it uses esoteric TrueType features, it's possible
    that FreeType will choke on it in some way. The only way to know for sure is to
    try it."

  body: "I've not looked at the text too closely but at a guess it looks like Lucida
    or a similar hinted TrueType font with both gridfitted hinting and grayscale antialiasing
    applied. \r\n\r\nYou see very similar rendering on Windows under regular antialiasing
    if you hack the 'gasp' table of a hinted font like Tahoma using the TTFGasp tool.

    is hard to quantify)\r\nthen it all backfires... Questions: does FreeType have\r\nconsistent

    nothing fancy at the TT level, in fact the point\r\nis to make it all fool-proof

    certainly no redistribution. Because: it's not legal,\r\nis it? Do you think Register.com
    is really doing that?\r\n\r\nOr maybe: they didn't actually modify the font,\r\nthe
    renderer is deciding what font features to\r\nuse and not.\r\n\r\nI wonder why
    they didn't just leave it 1-bit though,\r\nsince the font is clearly not designed
