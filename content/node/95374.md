  body: "... unless the font didn\u2019t consist of cubic bezier curves in the first
    place. TrueType outlines (quadratic bezier curves) are converted to cubic beziers,
    which Illustrator isn\u2019t particularly good at. So expanding TrueType fonts
    will insert additional points on the curves."
