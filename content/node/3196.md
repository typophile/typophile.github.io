  my browser. I looked through my fonts folder and couldn&#39;t find them. Can somebody
  explain to me what these fonts are? Do they always come with Windows and Mac? If
  so, for how long now? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the site: <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/"

  body: I don&#39;t see the usual tell-tale WEFT tags in the source code. Could be
    that it&#39;s done in FAIRY - or whatever the other embedding technology is.
