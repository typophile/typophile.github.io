body: "Question. When kerning, the goal is to make the word have a consistent texture
  right?\r\nSo for the word \"EFFECTIVE\" set in Futura (light),\r\nThe capital 'C'
  has so much white space in the counter compared to the rest of the\r\ncapital letters.
  Would this need a lot of space between the letters, so the\r\nC's counter doesn't
  look so white compared to the rest of the word?\r\nI see people track words in this
  same situation very tight. Is that just a fashionable\r\nthing to do? Or is that
  the correct way? Thanks for your help Typophiles.\r\nI'm not sure why i cannot upload
  images. But here is an image of what I mean.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/etahchen/6739052239/in/photostream/lightbox/"

  body: "The correct thing to do is to take the trickiest combination in your word,
    space, or kern it properly to a width you find acceptable, and use this 'optical
    white' on the rest of the combinations. So while your wide solution is a bit over
    the top in width, it's much better than going for the first solution. \r\n\r\nOf
    course this is only if you are able to give it that amount of attention, usually
    only the difficult pair needs a different value. Also, when letter-spacing properly
    (for titles or whatever) it's also easier to start of wide and make small adjustments
    backwards, tightening it up.\r\n\r\nAbout it being fashionable, I don't really
    know, you see extremes on both ways quite often in everything that tries to be
    design-ey. Light weights are the fashion lately though, probably because of the
    popularity of HFJ type."

    the Light</a>\r\n\r\nThe Thin types that I listed in the article were pretty much
    the only fonts available in 2001 that went truly Thin (not Thesis, for instance,
    despite its many weights), so apart from Neue Helvetica, you can see Font Bureau\u2019s
    role in developing new Thin types\u2014especially Frere-Jones\u2019 conception
    (this was before he joined Hoefler) of the \u201CHairline\u201D which he applied
    to Interstate. Those two types were, I think, instrumental in popularizing the
    genre (more so than my Bodoni Egyptian, which may have been noticed by type designers,
    but has never been a really popular face).\r\n\r\nI note in the article that Sam
    Stitt used Futura small to create a Thin effect. \r\n\r\nConcerning Futura, I
    had seen it used in the 1970s and 80s set very tight, and even set it like that
    myself a few times\u2014it had/has a quite nice effect that way in the upper and
    lower case, but not so much in the all-cap setting."

    weights. In think in your version the difference in width between EFT and C is
    quite extreme. Maybe another version or weight would help you. '

    of light and its a lot better actually.

  body: 'People have said that the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/|ND
    version]] is the most accurate. I don''t know if the light weight is original,
    though. I question how wide the light C is, compared to the heavier weights. I
    suspect the problem is that they were also trying to harmonize with the geometric
    O. You can see in the heavier weights the E and C get closer to the same width
    and typographic color. If you just go on MyFonts and search on Futura you can
    compare for yourself. The Bitstream version might work for you.  '
