body: "hello :)\r\n\r\ni am writing about the type \"Bickham Script PRO\". this is
  already installed somehow in my mac but i've no idea why i can't locate it. i can
  use it in photoshop and stuff though. must be because it's an adobe type, maybe
  the program gives me that option.\r\n\r\ndoes anybody know where i could possibly
  find this font in my system? it doesn't appear in the fontbook at all!\r\n\r\nthanks
  for reading\r\nx"

    Even though the DejaVu fonts appeared in my OpenOffice font list, I could not
    see them in other applications, and I could not find them with Spotlight. Because
    I was new to the Mac environment, I did not realize that a font included within
    an application package can be used inside that application while remaining invisible
    to the rest of the system. If the suggestions above haven't helped, try searching
    Photoshop's application package. Go to your Applications folder, right click Photoshop,
    select \"Show Package Contents\", and use Spotlight to search for a file name
    including Bickham within the Photoshop package.\r\n\r\nGerry K"
