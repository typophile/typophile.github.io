  body: "I am starting to think this might have been custom work, but I found some
    intriguing similarities in some of the late Bob Alonso's work, especially [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/alonso-flair/|Alonso
    Flair]], which has a similar M and A among other letters. Several other fonts
    by him include details similar to this lettering. Reading his [[http://www.myfonts.com/person/alonso/bob/|profile]],
    it was apparent that he did a lot of lettering and font design in his career,
    and it may be possible he did the lettering for this film's credits.\r\n\r\nThe
    only references I could find in earlier threads had to do with the movie's web
    site back in 2004 (now gone), and Yves said they used a customized Trajan for
    that. I don't think it could have been the same lettering that you are asking
    about.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
