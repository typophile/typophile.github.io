body: Hello typophiles, <BR> <BR>I am looking for a resource or resources to find
  other alphabets that match the design of helvetica. <BR> <BR>For non-latin words
  and phrases, I don&#39;t want to just set the translated words in helvetica, I want
  the actual letterforms used in these languages. <BR> <BR>The thing is, I don&#39;t
  know yet what languages I will need, and what alphabets they use. <BR> <BR>Help!

  body: I&#39;m not sure I get it. You want to write out English words according to
    their sounds, but in other scripts, and in a Helvetica style? <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    you&#39;ll find Helvetica &#34;cognates&#34; in plenty of other scripts... but
    the vast majority of them will suck. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Well, for <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=242801">Helvetica
    Cyrillic</a> and <a href="http://www.paratype.com/fstore/fonts/Helvetica-Greek-Monotonic.htm">Helvetica
    Greek</a> you&#39;re in luck. <BR> <BR>For Japanese, I recommend <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1802.html">Heisei
    Kaku Gothic</a>. <a href="http://www.dynalab.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabId=3548">Dynalab</a>
    has has a similar Chinese font &#40;Hei&#41; in one of their paks. <BR> <BR>You
    can browse through Monotype&#39;s list of <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_list.asp">Non-Western</a>
    fonts as well. I didn&#39;t find a good match for all scripts, but for Bengali
    I&#39;d go with <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=bengali">ITR
    Dilip</a>, for Devanagari <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=devanagari">ITR
    Mitra</a> &#40;although Chakra, Kable, or Yogesh would probably also work&#41;,
    for Gujarati <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=gujarati">ITR
    Mohan</a>, for Kannada <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=kannada">ITR
    Sarita</a>, for Telugu <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=telugu">ITR
    Prabha</a>. Their <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=hebrew">Arial
    Hebrew</a> isn&#39;t bad. <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=thai">Arial
    Thai</a> is also serviceable, but I&#39;d go for UPC Browillia instead. For Korean,
    <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/isv/wt_fontsample.asp?lan=korean">HY Gothic</a>
    will do, but I find it aesthetically flat. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m doing
    a disservice to smaller, independent foundries who have made fonts to harmonize
    with the <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/18/1084783500044.html?from=storyrhs&amp;oneclick=true">Most
    Ubiquitous Font in the World</a>

  body: 'Hey, Raph, killer. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Arial &#40;which is a Helvetica clone&#41;
    has an Arabic &#40;at least in my version of Windows, XP-Home&#41;, although looking
    at it now it doesn&#39;t look very Helvetica at all... Which however does mean
    it looks more Arabic and more readable.  :-&#41; <BR>2&#41; There&#39;s a font
    called Arial-Unicode: it covers gobs of codepages &#40;it&#39;s about 30Mb&#41;
    but some of its parts -like the Armenian- are quite lousy, and I don&#39;t know
    if it&#39;s even generally available...  :-/ <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s an idea: look
    into Abbar&#39;s <i>Univers</i> Arabic &#40;featured in an issue of Eye last year&#41;
    which will probably be sufficiently Helvetica for you. But really, there <i>must</i>
    be a &#34;decent&#34; Arabic Helvetica somewhere - it&#39;s a face that has infested
    virtually every script, why not Arabic? <BR> <BR>hhp'
