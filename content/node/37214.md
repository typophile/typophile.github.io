    Do you want the history of the style? \r\n\r\nGive us some more details and maybe
    we can help.\r\n\r\nAK"

    and you can get a number of clear hits with google.  \r\n\r\nOr did you mean the
    typeface? I don't know. It's terrifically terrible. \r\n*looks at the 'i' and
    shudders*"

    It's a type crime. \r\n\r\n;>"

    to use for letterhead and also for our website. Even something similar would be
    fine.\r\n\r\nAll I have is the jpg image from our printer. Our printer did not
    have the font. I assume they don't want me to stop buying letterhead."

  body: A new one resembling this type is exactly what I'm looking for. Any ideas
    on font that resemble this.

  body: I have no idea how this typeface is relevant for insurance, but I am digging
    it's retro-ness.  It's probably some old photo-lettering face or was custom-drawn,
    since there are a few ligatures in there.

    a cleaner retro font like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/washington/d-regular/\">washington.</a>"

    likely, since your office has been using this for years, is that the printer was
    originally given something to scan and all they have is a bitmap image, same as
    you.  I'd be very surprised if this were identified as an actual typeface.  "
