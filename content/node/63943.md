    have a teaching session.

  body: I don't get it either. Not even close. Then again, we all thought "Google"
    was a silly word and it'd never catch on. I think I'm typographer@googlewave.com?
    Doesn't it simply use your gmail name?

  body: "what i've discovered so far is that it rocks at editing text. like me and
    a friend were mucking about with it and ti was seriously fun, like instant messageing
    on steroids. but until there are apps made for it that extend it's usefullness,
    it's not that much of fun thing to use, that beign said, i honestly believe that
    in a couple of years wave tech or similar ideas will be in all our email clients.
    \r\n\r\nas a collobration tool it has heaps of potential. \r\n\r\nfor me the biggest
    thing that i have to keep getting my head around is that it's not public like
    say twitter or facebook, but that's it's private like email, i always feel it's
    more like twitter or facebook, thus i kinda expect it to be public. \r\n\r\nwhat
    would be cool, is if we had 'wave parties' where a few of us were online at the
    same time using wave live, i think that's were it really shines :-)\r\n\r\noh
    and you have to try the playback feature - it's cool!"
