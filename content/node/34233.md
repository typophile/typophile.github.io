  the forum for a while and am finally making my first post!\r\n\r\nI need to put
  together a typeface catalogue for the agency I work for, and I'm wondering what
  type management software would be the best for this. I would like to print the font
  name, an alphabet in uppercase and lowercase, and a sample sentence for each font
  we have (keeping the different weights together, not on separate pages if possible).
  \r\n\r\nI have fontbook, Font Explorer and Suitcase available, and no budget to
  buy new software. What could you all suggest to make this task as easy as possible?
  I was thinking of creating PDFs with font explorer and printing them; but the problem
  is that only the sample sentence or alphabet is in these PDFs... \r\n\r\nThanks
  for your suggestions! :) "

    you have InDesign and know how to script it, this will be fairly easy to do.\r\nOr
    you can try someone else's scripts:\r\n-- <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&extid=1046520\">Font
    book, VCS</a>\r\n-- <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&extid=1046567\">ID
    Font Catalog, VCS</a>\r\n-- <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&extid=1046401\">Font
