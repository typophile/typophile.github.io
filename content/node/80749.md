body: "I'm having glyphs disappear when I output my fonts. It seems to happen spontaneously,
  and appears to be related to adjustments to an outline, and the ones that disappear
  are not the glyph I've just modified. \r\n\r\nFor instance, I adjusted the spur
  of the small cap g, and this is what happened (before and after):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stp-missing001_4481.png]\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone seen this before?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcs"

  body: "I've had something like that happen with Fontforge, but likely for a different
    reason.\r\nTo keep my glyph set manageable when editing, I switch encodings often,
    and set it for Unicode before generating a font. Sometimes I forget myself and
    leave the Encoding>Compact item checked, and that screws the thing up like you
    show.\r\n\r\nAgain, not likely your problem, but I thought it worth mentioning."

    be too.
