  replace my HP 5000n \u2013 an old machine that produced beautiful pages. It\u2019s
  been a long time since I\u2019ve shopped for printers and I\u2019m wondering what
  typophiles prefer these days for the highest-quality monochrome printer for typography
  and (secondarily) image quality. Thanks for any feedback."

    to recommend one of [[www.okidata.com|OKI Data's]] monochrome multifunction printers.
    The MB401 Series has received a lot of awards since it's launch in June 2012 (I
    bought mine in August). The image quality is excellent, it's an all in one printer,
    and perfect for all my printing needs. \r\n\r\nHere's the link to the Series page-
    there are a few different mono MFPs (http://www.okidata.com/mkt/html/nf/MFP.php?sku=MB401Series).
    I have the [[http://www.okidata.com/mkt/html/nf/MFP.php?sku=MB401Series|MB471w]]
    because of it's wireless printing capabilities! \r\n\r\nwww.okidata.com. Definitely
    recommended! Hope this is helpful."

    I'm out of touch with current models, but do make sure you get at least 1200dpi
    and true PS support.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in your (just-created-this-morning) profile? Is it because you work there?\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, the original poster is soliciting printer suggestions. Maybe this
    is what he asked for."

    not been an automated post, but the profile on your brand new account lists okidata.com
    as your home page so it clearly appears to be an advertisement."

    first PostScript Laserprinter, an Oki. In 1989 it was around 9000 USD (knock off
    price, because it was a demo model), and the LED-tech made for razorsharp prints,
    far better than Canon and Apple had then.\r\nIn other words: you can do worse
    than Oki\u2026 : )"
