  odd request/question for you all here.\r\nI want to buy fonts from LHF - Letterheas
  Fonts, but when I try that I get the answer \"We don\u2019t accept orders from Sweden\"
  ... thats it, no statement why or anything like that.\r\n\r\nSo my question is,
  does anybody here know if its possible to buy em from somwhere else? Or is it possible
  to buy it from one of you users here maybe? (And yes Ive asked LHF but got no response
  back. )\r\n\r\nThanx!\r\n\r\n/Henrik"

  body: "That's an odd one for sure. I'm in the UK and have bought direct from their
    website in the past with no problems. I guess the first question I have to ask
    is what are you using to pay for fonts, as it could be possible the card (I assume)
    you're using may only work in Sweden. The only other thing that immediately sprang
    to mind was the The Pirate Bay is 'of Swedish origin' and so maybe the owners
    of 'LHF' are taking some moral position about that - a stretch maybe, but you
    never can tell...\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "Thanx for the answers, but I cant even create an account there.\r\nThats
    when I got the \"We don\u2019t accept orders from Sweden\" when I asked why.\r\n\r\nSo
    yeah, seeing em working hard against piracy I dont see how this will help em.
    If they stop certain costumers for being honest and buy from them, the only way
    is.... piracy.\r\nI dont want to see that happen.\r\n\r\nThanx again :)"

  body: "Henrik,\r\n\r\nA few of them (5) are sold at MyFonts; http://new.myfonts.com/search/LHF/fonts/\r\n\r\nI
    had a quick look at Letterheads website, and I have to admit it's a bit odd why
    they just sell their typefaces to certain countries;\r\nUnited States, Germany,
    Australia, Ireland, Austria, Japan, Belgium,\tNetherlands, Canada, New Zealand,
    Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, France and United Kingdom. So all the other ones
    are not good enough???\r\n\r\nI fully respect and agree with his piracy policy
    etc, but it's not good publicity if they are hard to find. There should be no
    problem to buy typefaces from smaller or bigger foundries/vendors.\r\n\r\nI suggest
    you send them a nice e-mail again and ask why they don't ship to Sweden.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."

    it doesn't mean all Swedes just love to steal things on the Internet.

    seems. Just my opinion, but I''d look for an alternative face from an alternative

  body: "a bit of a weird policy from LHF I'd say...when people can't buy them they
    just get it some other way, meaning people will just download them, i feel LHF
    is kind of pushing potential clients to download fonts illegally.\r\n\r\nkind
    of reminds me of the Microsoft policy, Microsoft doesn't do business with certain
    country's, yet 90% of pc users is on windows over there, how do you think they
    got it?"

    me an alternative. They havent responded to that. It was some days ago.\r\nI would
    look for other fonts, but they do have those that match my designs perfectly...
    sadly :p\r\n\r\nHope I can find someone who can sell some \"second hand\" :)"
