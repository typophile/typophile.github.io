body: I&#39;m working on an alumni directory. Haven&#39;t really had to address the
  formatting of degree notations before, but now it&#39;s an issue. <BR> <BR>Anyone
  have any advice for treating small caps in this situation? Things like BS Ed, BS
  Ag, M Ed. Right now, we&#39;re treating the first section &#40;BS&#41; as two small
  caps, and the 2nd section &#40;Ed&#41; as initial cap small cap.  <BR> <BR>Suggestions?

  body: I&#39;m just shooting off of the top of my head here, so  <BR>hopefully someone
    can confirm with a style guide, but... <BR>I don&#39;t believe small caps are
    used at all in these  <BR>situations, simply because of the uncertainty. often  <BR>times,
    small caps are avoided in two letter combos -- I  <BR>don&#39;t really like the
    way it looks, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve  <BR>understood the <i>official</i>
    rules to be.

    that as the words that are shortened are capitalized, I would say they should
    be caps and not smallcaps. And visually you&#39;ll tip the name over, I think,
    if you don&#39;t use caps. '

  body: Although I am unaware of any particular style guide rules about such formatting,
    this sample illustrates a format that seems satisfactory &#40;in terms of legibility
    and clear communication&#41;. My degree &#40;from San Jose State&#41; is rather
    unusual, so my goal is to provide a bit of explanation in my format choice. The
    person&#39;s name is size &#34;x&#34;, the degree &#40;in U&amp;lc&#41; is approx.
    80% of x, the explanation &#40;in this case GRAPHIC DESIGN&#41; is at approx.size
    60% of x. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/8871.gif"

    doesn&#39;t make much sense.  <BR>that&#39;s kind of like letting the application
    do small caps,  <BR>but then you change the rules and end up with two  <BR>different
    types of faux small caps. I would suggest  <BR>either using real small caps or
    sticking with standard  <BR>U&amp;lc. <BR>

  body: Thanks for the input all,  <BR> <BR>Some people seem to have this huge alphabet
    soup after their name from multiple degrees, and that was the impetus.  <BR> <BR>I
    try to use true small caps whenever appropriate, but in this case, I guess it
    may not fly. If they look distracting, it sort of misses the point.
