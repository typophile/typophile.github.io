    to some [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/stratum2/|Stratum]] customized
    (stencilized and some points from ascenders moved in). Here are some loosely similars:
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/vafle/|Vafle]] (stencil), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque-stencil/|Geogrotesque]]

  body: Thanks Anand we'll send you a copy as it was a free release for a limited
    time. It will eventually see a full release as it's being rebuilt from the ground
    up as a mixed-case type with true italics including a non-stencil version as well.
