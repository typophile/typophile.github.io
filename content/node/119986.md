body: "Hi all.\r\nRecently I\u2019ve switched to proportional fonts for programming,
  and have been looking for font choices, but find I\u2019m missing some vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThere
  was a post on variable width fonts for coding here: http://typophile.com/node/13090\r\nBut
  aside from a few choices, I couldn't glean how to look for good fonts.\r\n\r\nHere
  are the characteristics I\u2019m looking for:\r\n0 - The font needs to work well
  at small sizes and coarse resolutions.\r\n1 - The lowercase L and number 1, as well
  as capital i, need to be distinct at small sizes. Same with zero and o (upper and
  lowercase).\r\n2 - Punctuation needs to be prominent. A period and a comma mustn\u2019t
  be confused. Same with primes and hatches. (Helvetica and Fira Sans crash and burn
  here).\r\n3 - Brackets, braces and parenthesis need room to breathe. It should be
  easy to select a single one out of a sequence with the mouse.\r\n4 - The dot in
  the lowercase i needs to be visible at small sizes. Or at list, lowercase i and
  l need to be visibly different.\r\n5 - Good line spacing, as text editors typically
  don't offer adjustment of leading.\r\n\r\nAre there names for any of these criteria?
  Or any general classification or help to find font families that match well?\r\n\r\nI
  notice that Bitstream fonts (and Verdana and Georgia) generally do better than fonts
  from other foundries when it comes to braces, brackets, punctuation. Why is this
  so? Why do most foundries squash these characters?\r\nI also notice that a lot of
  sans serifs are directly disqualified by criterium 1. Why is it so popular to make
  letters look like each other? Isn't this bad for readability?\r\n\r\nWhat are others
  using? Some of my findings below.\r\n\r\nGood fonts I've found:\r\n* Verdana is
  very good, and unmatched in giving room to braces, brackets and punctuation. But
  its lowercase i can be confused with an l at small sizes (an artifact of antialiasing
  and small pixel count, but still).\r\n* Bitstream Vera Serif: the Sans fails distinguishing
  i, L, one. Vera Serif is pretty good, but its large x-height and small line spacing
  make it uncomfortable for me.\r\n* Charter: very good in all respects. Perhaps the
  best overall.\r\n* Input family: I like the idea of it, but like Vera, the spacing
  and x-height combine to make it unusable for me.\r\n* Adobe Source Pro family: the
  Mono is the best monospaced font I know. The serif fails by compressing brackets,
  braces, parens.\r\n"

      mentioned it I don't need to say more.\r\n\r\nI personally favor Menlo and Espresso
      Mono. Fira Mono is nice too."

    hope more designers take up the challenge of proportional fonts for coding. Rather
    an under-served sector.\r\n"

  body: "The [[http://code.google.com/p/i3project/wiki/Fonts|i3project]] has some
    interesting fonts.  The Trim font is a proportional font with enlarged punctuation
    for use in coding.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to take an open source proportional
    font like Adobe Source Pro and replace its punctuation with the larger punctuation
    from Adobe Source Pro Mono.  Some of the spacing of the punctuation might need
    to be shrunk, but I think this might produce a reasonable result.  Worth a try,
    anyway.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Mark, ITC Officina looks pretty good. Dutch 811 seems to fit, too.\r\n\r\nStephen,
    that project is fantastic! Looks inactive, but I installed the fonts, and Trim
    is perfect. Cruft and Untyped are also worthwhile.\r\nInteresting, I'd love to
    try my hand at customizing Adobe Source Serif. What programs does one use to do
    that?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "@Mark Simonson I bought ITC Officina Sans. It's excellent, every character
    is distinct, and it's so readable.\r\nIs there any term to describe fonts of this
    sort? And are there any fonts that are like Officina but wider?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Thanks Mark. TheMix looks very interesting; I just don\u2019t want to to
    pay for the 100+ EUR package just for coding.\r\nIt\u2019s coming down to a compromise.
    Input doesn\u2019t quite do it for me; I don\u2019t know why.\r\nOfficina is great,
    but doesn\u2019t render that well on screen at the sizes I need.\r\nI\u2019m settling
    on Verdana as the best compromise right now.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m glad Input is exploring
    this niche. And I think others can benefit from fonts that make every character
    distinct, not just coders. Best way to catch typos!\r\nBy the way, I found discussions
    on DIN 1450 extremely interesting.  http://typophile.com/node/102215\r\n"

    OCR-F\r\nI even notice that I can set it to a smaller size than usual, since the
    characters are so distinct. Makes sense that this would make a good OCR font.\r\n\r\n@Mark
    Simonson, by the way, I realized that Anonymous Pro, which I use in terminals,
    is yours. Thanks!"
