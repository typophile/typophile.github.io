body: "Hi everyone. I have been searching and search for fonts like this and it's
  been pretty difficult. So, I come here for your expertise. I apologize in advance
  if I am not good at explaining/wording things.\r\n\r\nThe best font I've found thus
  far is Galapagos BRK\r\n\r\nhttp://www.allfreefonts.com/font-539-galapogos_brk.html\r\n\r\nMore
  specifically, I am using the word \"know\" in all lowercase:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.allfreefonts.com/custom-thumb.html?d=539&fontfilename=galapog...\r\n\r\nThe
  features that appeal to me are:\r\n\r\n1. Sans-serif\r\n\r\n2. No flags on letters
  like \"n\" (or whatever that straight part extending on the top left of the letter
  is called)\r\n\r\n3. All letters follow the \"n\" form. So, the \"w\" is like a
  double upside down \"n\" and the bottom of the \"k\" is \"n\" as well. The \"o\"
  is basically 2 \"n\" against one another, although I am more lenient on the \"o\"
  not following suit perfectly (as long as it flows).\r\n\r\n4. This goes along with
  #2 but basically 99% of all fonts have the \"k\" and \"w\" as sharp. Instead of
  the \"k\" looking like an \"h\" they have 2 straight lines making them up. The \"w\"
  ends up looking like double \"v\" rather than a double \"u\" and it kills it.\r\n\r\n5.
  Something bold please. It'll be used for a logo\r\n\r\n6. If it were free for commercial
  use... that'd be great. If not, at least inexpensive to buy with a license that
  allows me to use the lettering for a logo.\r\n\r\nAny and all help would be greatly
  appreciated. Thanks!"

  body: "Your question is a little open ended, but maybe this will help narrow your
    search a little. Identifont.com allows you to search typefaces by similarity (although
    it seems to not have Galapagos BKR in its database. However, you can also search
    by appearance. This can be helpful as well.\r\n\r\nI tried searching by appearance,
    and recieved [[http://www.identifont.com/list?17+id+5+8LK+2+4SU+2+67E+2+8O9+2+59+2+E14+2+5R2+2+8LP+3+4CJ+3+6MV+3+CAN+3+1EL+3+6TA+3+OUG+3+P1K+3+5E+3+XI+3+4FY+3+4FX+3+4FW+3+GS+4+NOF+4+2CZV+4+CI1+4+2V3+4+3FE+4+3FF+4+2W1+4+NGU+4+4RK+4|these
    results]].\r\n\r\nI also searched for a font in the same family (from the above
    search, called Timberlake), and recieved [[http://www.identifont.com/list?3+timberlake+0+E14+1+JEK+4+F3N+4+BLL+4+BJP+4+1WCU+5+6JS+5+MAS+5+NCO+5+G5J+5+LDB+5+EXG+5+HTI+5+F0N+5+F0O+5+BJT+5+AB9+5+9O7+5+9NV+5+7EB+5+7EC+5+F1Q+5+9KW+5+4XI+5+I4Q+5+KTV+5+KU7+5+BQX+5+5PK+5+E0Z+5|these
    results]].\r\n\r\nIf any of these are closer, you can go back and plug them into
    \"Fonts by Similarity."
