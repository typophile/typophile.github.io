    for the disjointed letters in general, however the P and K are really nice. You
    may want to explore some more. <BR>Does the client want something clean, hi-tech,

    its just not their character&#41;. The client wants to stick with 4E5.b and 4E5.
    But at the same time has thoughts to #4 with the reversing technique.  <BR> <BR>Still,
    I don&#39;t think we are done yet.. Some are saying they like E5 instead, especially
    now after seeing the last two.  <BR> <BR>Marc I think you right about the Kerning
    on 4E5.c, but to me, it loses appeal when its too tight. Imagine it on a magazine
    overlaying a photo.'

  body: Well, if you decided for the clean way &#40;not so &#40;s&#41;punky&#41;,
    than maybe you should make the un ligature more smooth. I don&#39;t know, maybe
    it is just the screen, but that curve seems to be a bit broken to me.

  body: I&#39;d have to agree with Matjaz. The un ligature has some very visible tension
    where the two letters meet at the curve. It definitely needs to be smoothed out.
    Ignore perfect geometry here and cheat a little on the curve. <BR> <BR>You can
    see the same problem with the S curve on the attached rough. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15245.jpg"
