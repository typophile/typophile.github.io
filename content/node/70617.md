  body: "Thanks for your reply Lex.  On studying this further I think number 3 may
    be Univers BQ-Italic.  Number 1 possibly  HelveticaEXT0 3 or Helvetica- Narrow.
    Number 2 possibly Helvetica BQ-Roman or Helvetica LT Std\r\n\r\nI just wondered
    what you opinion on this was and if you have any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
    Tom\r\n"
