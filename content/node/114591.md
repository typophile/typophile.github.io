  body: "Remember that the time period that you say this comes from is long before
    fonts as we talk about them. Are these metal letters? My point is that these were
    probably made (or drawn) by hand, and they may not even resemble typefaces that
    were in use. The similar fonts you found may be the best you can do.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Tilde shaped crossbars were popular for lettering during the era. Note that
    there were also fonts with the feature. Some previous discussions http://typophile.com/node/103815
    \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/113899 \r\nSome digital fonts exist, but they differ
    in detail. For example Greater Albion's Jonquin http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/jonquin/
    Storm's Tenebra http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/tenebra/ Storm's Patzcuaro
