    target="_blank">ITC Modern No. 216</a> is a safe bet.

  body: My personal theory is that ITC was trying to make everything look like Helvetica,
    particularly its x-height. But, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/americana/"
    target="_blank">they</a> <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/antique-olive/"
    target="_blank">weren&#39;t</a> <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/stilla/"
    target="_blank">alone</a>. <BR> <BR>I do remember that the prevailing wisdom in
    the seventies &#40;promoted by ITC and others&#41; was that typefaces with large
    x-heights were easier to read and used space more efficiently. There is a certain
    amount of truth to this &#40;for example, newspaper faces&#41;, but it was mostly
    just the changing winds of taste and fashion.

    Design Observer entry, I hate ITC Garamond. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/000205.html"

    is a RARE example of a nice font with a big x-height.  <BR> <BR>ITC was all over
    the place when I started designing and my boss PROHIBITED us &#40;thank god&#41;
    from using them.

  body: I think the only problem with ITC Garamond is that it isn&#39;t Garamond.
    <BR> <BR>It is a right face with a wrong name. Too many people uses it as a classical
    face, but it doesn&#39;t look classical at all. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a good testimony
    of the Herb Lubalin typographic thought.
