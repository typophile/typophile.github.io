body: "Here are some spreads of my new 'New Maya Language' book.  This book compiles
  my previous works in a simple easy to understand format.\r\n\r\nThe New Maya Language
  is a redesign and recomposition of certain original Maya script ideographs that
  communicate concepts and even sentences.  It parallels the principle of the Chinese-concept
  script where primary root or Lego-like pictographs can be combined to generate compound
  pictographs that signify a more complex idea (Chizlet, C.). \r\n\r\nThe \u2018Maya
  Language\u2019 section of the book introduces a basic understanding of how the Maya
  writing system works. \r\n\r\nThe second section tells the story 'Joya de Cer\xE9n'
  UNESCO World Heritage Archaeological Site in El Salvador in Central America through
  23 New Maya Language glyphs.  Spread by spread the reader is introduced to each
  one of them and how they were formulated. For example, \u2018Stone\u2019 + \u2018Fire\u2019
  combined equal the \u2018Lavastone\u2019 New Maya Language ideograph.\r\n\r\nFinally,
  the \u2018Applications\u2019 section shows real life examples of how the New Maya
  Language can be taken forward to other forms of visual communication, such as brand
  identities. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-0_3632.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-2_5394.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-5_4805.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-6_4382.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-7_5140.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-9_4878.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-14_6313.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/New-Maya-Language-15_6743.JPG]"
