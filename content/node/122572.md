    similar script letter is found in Grand Hotel http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/grand-hotel\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GrandHotel_G_5767.jpg]\r\nSlope
    the _G_ 20 degrees right and widen it by q40% and it looks like [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GrandHotel_G_slope20degWidth140pct_5336.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Agree with Don, custom lettering. 2 options for me:\r\n- Don's approach:
    mash-up fonts, a basic sans and a script; for instance, the sans could be  [[http://www.dafont.com/buttacup.font|Buttacup]]
    and the script [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/elan|Elan]] (Don's suggestion),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/lightnin|Lightnin]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/fontella|Fontella]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/gillies-gothic|Gillies Gothic]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kaufmann|Kaufmann]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/penmanshift|Penmanshift]] (nice this one),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/coquette|Coquette]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/futura-script|Futura
    Script]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/ht-maison|Maison]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/varga|Varga]]
    (nice too), [[http://www.dafont.com/airstream.font|Airstream]]\r\n- choose an
    appropriate sans ([[http://www.dafont.com/buttacup.font|Buttacup]]) and customize
    letters.\r\nI like and even if it's different (flare serif) [[http://youngjerks.com/#/highway-typeface|Highway]]
    by Dan Cassaro.\r\nSome ready-to-go options: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/selaive|Selaive]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/merced|Merced]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/brownstone-sans|Brownstone
    Sans]], [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/6367355/Myra-Caps-(Typeface)|Myra Caps]],
    [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/2721389/Kylie-(Typeface)|Kylie]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/solomon|Solomon]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/gist|Gist]] (slab and inline... ouch...
    but same vein), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/justanotherfoundry/peacock|Peacock]]\r\nMaybe
    a dead-end but you could have a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/nexa-rust|Nexa
    Rust]] and try to mix Nexa Sans with its Script... Not sure it works though..."
