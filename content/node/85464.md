  and would be very grateful for some pointers with the question and possible chapters
  within the dissertation.\r\n\r\nI want to research typography and colour in advertising
  and how it  can effects consumers to buy a product. Do you think this is enough
  to go on or do you think I should focus on an area of advertising, gender or product?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n:)"

  body: Focus. First thing, you should choose between colour and typography.

  body: Of course, both color and typography are elements of <em>graphic design</em>.
    Is that perhaps your <em>real</em> topic?

  body: "<em>I want to research typography and colour in advertising and how it can
    effects consumers to buy a product.</em>\r\nYou can't measure the impact of typography
    on a consumer. A bit easier approach is to understand typography as an equivalent
    of persuasive speech and deconstruct the goals that the authors (probably) wanted
    to reach. Anyway, there are no easy and clear methods; qualitative research needs
    a lot of time and effort.\r\n\r\n<em>Do you think this is enough to go on or do
    you think I should focus on an area of advertising, gender or product?</em>\r\nDefinetly,
    you should focus yourself on certain area (not only on the above mentioned, but
    for example some design patterns, like titles or claims).\r\n\r\nLast year, at
    one of our schools, a group of students wanted to start very similar program.
    As the school has marketing/menagement profile, they were quiet well prepared
    to design and manage the research. Inspite of good will, and after long and difficult
    discussion with the dean, they had to quit the program and change the theme, as
    the dissertation wouldn't fill the expectations of broadly understood, academic
    and \"scientifical\" objectivity.\r\n\r\n"

    by David Ogilvy\r\n\r\n<em>Type & Layout: Are You Communicating or Just Making
    Pretty Shapes</em> by Colin Wheildon\r\n\r\nThese are somewhat print-centric,
    but the principles, which were empirically derived (especially from direct mail)
    are still valid.\r\n\r\nPresently, TV ads have a lot of typography, so that the
    ads can still \"talk\" to viewers when they hit the Mute button.\r\nAs well as
    the fact that After Effects is a wonderful tool box for animating type."
