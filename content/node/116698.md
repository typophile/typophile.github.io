body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nI am the Historian of the New York Press Photographers Association,
  and have collected quite a few samples of press credentials that were issued by
  the New York City Police Department. I've identified one font that was used for
  much of the first half of the 20th century by the NYPD, not only on press cards,
  but on other official documents such as taxi licenses, wanted posters, and other
  official publications. I thought it was a proprietary font, until I just noticed
  that it was also used as a header on Philadelphia death certificates from 1906-1909.
  I love it, though, and have incorporated it (through copy-and-paste) into my own
  business cards. It usually appears in upper-case only, but I have seen odd documents
  where lower case is used. Haven't been able to pinpoint its true identity, though.
  Any help?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMarc Hermann\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/philadeathrecord_4993.jpg]"

      was 'C', so if we were able to see that then we would know.
