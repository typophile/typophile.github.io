body: "This is a logo I designed for a local Christian Ministry that is just starting
  out. The name is \"Quest Ministries.\" I was originally going to use a compass as
  the ministry will help guide the people through life. But I thought it was too busy
  so I settled for this - a less complicated design but still has the direction idea
  to it. The logo with the four colors plays into their branding. The different colors
  symbolize different themes in their business. However, I made it two colors because
  I thought the four might be a little busy.\r\n\r\nI feel like the logo is fairly
  solid right now but it doesn't have anything in it that really makes it stand out.
  Any ideas? Suggestions?"

    only. Get that right before you move to colours. Second, how would that mark look
    if it was a character in the supporting typeface?"

    body: Well I have black and white versions; they don't exactly look stunning.
      I was thinking about inserting the icon in the typeface but I'm not sure where
      to put it. I guess either in the center of the "Q" or the intersection of the
      "t". Not sure how that would look.

  body: If it's a christian ministry, why not stretch that logo so it looks more cross-like.
    I'd use the two-tone version with, as Frode says, heavier and possibly tapered
    and curved outlines.

  body: I kept the logo more angular because I wanted to keep the directional and
    compass head feel. Would it be easier to change the type face and make that less
    curved / more angular?

  body: "I think you misunderstood me. I\u2019m talking about curve quality. Right
    now, the symbol and the type have nothing in common. I think this is the reason
    your black and white logo does not look \u201Cstunning\u201D. If you want to create
    a logotype, you should not ignore the most crucial part of the design: its shape.\r\n\r\nWhat
    if you draw the symbol as if it belonged to the typeface? How would it look then?
    How thick would the lines be? Would there be straight edges? How would the corners
    look? How would the whitespace relate to the whitespace in the typeface? How big
    would it be?"

  body: To me the word "quest" combined with a compass image conjures up thoughts
    of an exciting adventure, but your solution is rather static and formal. You might
    consider looking for ways to add a bit more energy to the symbol (perhaps a hand
    drawn look), and maybe using a script font that has some energy and personality.
    Maybe like someone artistic on a quest drew it in their journal.

    it.\r\n\r\nI agree with the posts above, there is very little that links the icon
    to the word 'Quest'. I think you need to try and make both elements work together
    a little more in harmony."

  body: "I see you're trying to relate the type to the symbol via color and stroke,
    but overall I just don't think the logo is working.  To me the symbol looks very
    generic (like clip art) and needs to be more distinctive.  The condensed type
    just doesn't convey the emotions of a quest to me. It needs some flair or mystery
    or excitement. And I think it's best to avoid thin strokes in logos.\r\n\r\nKeep
    working on it. Have you tried any of the things that folks suggested? Frank's
    idea of incorporating the symbol into the type is an interesting thought. For
    example, what if the Q was round (like the shape of a compass) with the symbol
    inside it?"

  body: "When I first saw this image, knowing that it referred to a Christian ministry
    of some sort, my first reaction was that \"Quest\" in that typeface looked very
    corporate (there is a Quest commercial medical lab services company, and their
    logo is widespread.) Quest Diagnostics apparently wants its logo to look solid
    and precise and reliable. \r\n\r\nSecond, I read your logo as a star. OK, star
    ... Christian ... Bethlehem. But a star should be represented monochrome, with
    a light color. The multicolor options all seemed wrong if I was reading the logo
    as a star. Then, I thought, it might represent a cross, which would be a little
    better, but not much, in more than one color. But the symmetrical Greek cross
    is a little problematic, bouncing visually between a star image and the usual
    Christian Roman cross with one long lower leg.\r\n\r\nThese, as I said, were my
    first impressions. "
