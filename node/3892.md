  <BR>By any chance, can anyone identify this typeface?

  body: ' That&#39;s Adobe Sans, the horrendous substitute font which ATM uses whenever
    the original fonts are not available on the user&#39;s computer system. This allows
    the user to read and print documents which feature those missing fonts. It&#39;s
    a chameleon-like typeface that uses Multiple Matser technology to match the widths
    of the missing font in order to take up exactly the same amount of space. It finds
    those widths in the &#34;ATM font database&#34;, a file in your System folder
    that includes the widths tables of almost every single typeface in the Adobe Type
    Library. So in fact this could be any typeface. '

    mistake, but I got so worked up by this that I almost tripped over myself writing
    this post. And Anonymous, don&#39;t get me wrong, the following rant is not aimed
    at you. Don&#39;t get caught in the crossfire. <BR> <BR>I mean, everywhere I look
    I keep bumping into Adobe Sans or Adobe Serif: on menus, in magazines and newsletters,
    on wrappers, on huge friggin&#39; billboards... even on my yoghurt pot at breakfast
    and on the jars of my favourite brand of rice sauce. Don&#39;t all these designers,
    art directors or whoever they might be have eyes and see that the typefaces they
    so carefully specified were missing when they output the files and came out all
    wrong? I kid you not, within the space of a couple of months we received two logos
    with Adobe Sans converted to outlines. Which is doubly ironic because converting
    your fonts to outlines is exactly what you do when you want to avoid having your
    typeface being replaced by ATM! Aaargh, this is driving me NUTS! &#40;wheeze wheeze

    not me, because I keep noticing these kind of things and sometimes get all worked
    up over them. '

    can&#39;t delve into the subject matter right now, because I badly need to finish
    the design of some business card, but what bugs me most is that the text in the
    sample looks like it&#39;s PR for some sort of graphic design firm. Can they really
    be taken seriously if their advertisement, capability brochure or whatever is
    flawed by such a production error? '

  body: 'Just a quick one before I sign off: automatic font substitution combining
    Multiple Master technology and font width tables was a stroke of genius, and a
    very important invention given the increasing importance of the Portable Document
    Format. But I fear in the process Adobe spawned a monster, and it&#39;s out there
    and can&#39;t be undone... Of course, the fact that the typefaces continually
    change their appearance like some kind of virus makes it very difficult to identify
    them, even to the trained eye, so I guess this explains why they keep popping
    up everywhere. <BR> <BR>P.S. If anyone wants more information on font substitution
    in ATM check Adobe&#39;s <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5070.SupportATM.pdf"
    TARGET="_blank">  Support Knowledgebase document</A>, under section 4, page 11.
    It&#39;s pretty rudimentary, but it&#39;s the best I could find.'

    whilst studying typefaces some vague notion of meaning and context come trickling

    realize that they&#39;re driving killing machines at breakneck speeds. They just
    rely too much on technology and become oblivious to the fact that it&#39;s still

    <BR>&#34;Can you point us to a good sample of Adobe Sans?&#34; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    the point exactly: there are no samples as Adobe Sans nor Adobe Serif are no proper
    fonts so to speak. They&#39;re supposed to be invisible impostors, that&#39;s
    their one and only purpose, and they only appear &#34;when anything else fails&#34;.
    I&#39;ll see if I can whup up something, because basically it&#39;s quite easy
    to recognize them. <BR> <BR>&#34;But maybe the Adobe sub fonts are &#42;too&#42;
    good?&#34; <BR> <BR>Technologically speaking, yes, but their design is awful,

    little patience, and watch this space.'

  body: 'I had a really tough time trying to create this sample, so excuse me if the
    italics aren&#39;t included. I was getting all these weird results after deactivating
    and removing the fonts and reopening the files: QuarkXPress substituted Gill Sans
    with Geneva, Adobe Illustrator used Adobe Sans for the regular weights but Helvetica
    Bold for the bolds, Acrobat used Adobe Sans but didn&#39;t slant the italics,
    Photoshop gave me Times for some lines, and InDesign is just too damn smart: it
    highlights all missing fonts with a thick red rule &#40;oooh I love that program!
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> &#41;.
    The system doesn&#39;t seem to work that consistently, and I suspect it&#39;s
    the programs themselves that have their own substitution rules which clash with
    the ATM system. <BR> <BR>So below is the result. Just keep in mind that the italics
    are slanted versions of the same faces. I know it&#39;s quite a large file, but
    it seemed a bit silly to make a sample of 12 pt type at screen resolution. <BR>

    show up pretty clearly then. If I had used News Gothic, it would have been a lot
