body: "If I like a commercial OT font but would like to tweak some letters, what software
  should I use. I don\u2019t intend to present it as my own work, I just prefer to
  tweak the original OT file instead of modifying every letter after typing it.\r\n\r\nI
  don\u2019t want to affect kerning or any of the OT features, I simply want to slightly
  rework some curves of some individual letters, then use it as if I had bought it
  that way.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

    the file, I just want to create something with it (poster, flyer), as anyone who
    buys a font. In terms of the result there should be no difference on the foundry\u2019s
    side, never heard of one prohibiting the tweaking of letters in Adobe Illustrator.\r\n\r\nJust
    wanted to know whether I\u2019ll screw up the mechanics of the file by modifying
    and reexporting a font."

  body: As reasonable as your plan may sound, many, if not most, foundries prohibit
    the end user from editing their fonts. Check the EULA of the font, and in future
    check the EULA before you buy.!

  body: "I've said this before, and it stands: to me that clause is an\r\nunreasonable
    scare tactic. A bit like those clothing labels on\r\nplain old cotton items that
    say \"hand wash only in cold water\".\r\nIf you can keep it firmly under your
    control, there's no way a\r\nfoundry can expect such control; that only makes
    people feel\r\nOK to break more rules. That said, you're still responsible for\r\nyour
    actions. If the font ends up in the hands of others, you'd\r\nbe firmly at fault.
    This sort of thing is true even if one does\r\na good deed, like save a life.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    only prohibited to edit the file, not to modify the letters in a graphic application,

    try to simulate a bad conscience while I do it and of course won\u2019t give it
    to anyone, neither the original nor my version.\r\n\r\nBut technically I can use

  body: "Putting aside the licensing issue, OpenType features will continue to work
    *if* you don't do anything that will change the GIDs of any of the glyphs referenced
    by the features -- i.e. you don't change the order of the glyphs within the font.\r\n\r\nIf
    you alter the glyph order, programs like FLS will recompile the features from
    decompiled source, and usually the features will work fine though occasionally
    you will run into glitches, particularly if the font includes features which FLS
    doesn't recognise. This is usually only a major issue when working with non-latin
    fonts.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: A small but potentially harmful side-effect is that you may end up with two
    <em>different</em> fonts (no matter how small the difference is) in your system,
    but with the very same font name and internal ID. To fix that you could either
    de-install your original (and thus only use the modified one), or dive in the
    <stkout>infernal</stkout> / internal details of Font Naming.

  body: I think it would be important to change the name of the font, jut to make
    sure the modified version is never mistaken for the original. Putting an .Md,
    or .Mod suffix after the style name in the PS Font Name, Full Name and OT Style
    Name fields will identify it as a different font, while still allowing it to appear
    as a member of the Family. You should also update the name in the TrueType Unique
    ID Record field as well.

  body: "It's certainly possible to make modifications to a font without changing
    anything else. Though, as Hrant said, the common font editors are not made to
    the purpose of \"round-tripping\" from font to work file back to font.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are familiar with ttx from the Python FontTools, you can convert both the
    original font and your modified font to an XML representation and find differences
    with one of the usual file comparison tools. But be warned, you'll have to have
    pretty low-level knowledge of font formats to make any sense of it."
