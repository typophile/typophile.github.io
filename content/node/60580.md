  body: "The movie came out in 1965, which is in the days before fonts in digital
    form (at least as we know them). This lettering looks like some of the style that
    Ed Benguiat and others did. Some of this style has been done at House Industries
    in their [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/edbenguiatfonts|Ed Benguiat collection]]
    and [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/burbankcollection|Burbank collection]]. \r\n\r\nThis
    style seems to have become popular again, and a number of foundries, such as Jukebox
    and Canada Type, in addition to House, have released revivals of styles from the
    60's era. Maybe it's because of all the Baby Boomers are feeling nostalgia for
    the old days when they were in their teens and twenties.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
