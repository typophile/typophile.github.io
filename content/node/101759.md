  body: "Thanks for replying George. I should have added that I've set things that
    way. I've not seen Karsten's fabulous explanation (he has SO much great info available,
    very helpful/generous guy) but I've read the article by John Hudson that he references.\r\n\r\nSetting
    the values as described in those articles works but only when Word is determining
    the leading with it's Line Spacing set to something other than \"Exactaly.\" Unfortunately
    we need to be able to set the line spacing in these projects to the specifications
    of the series.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to matter what those settings are made in
    the font, Word still clips the characters on screen when the leading is set to
    \"Exactaly.\" I guess that's just the way it works, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nKen"

  body: This is a Word issue. If you set an absolute ('exactly') leading value that
    is shorter than the WinAscent/WinDescent OS/2 values, then Word will clip. This
    is because of the way in which Word lays out each line.

    when PDF'd is fine.\r\n"
