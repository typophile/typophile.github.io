  body: Do the different styles have the same metrics? What I mean is, could it work
    as a layered font? That could be interesting.

  body: "Thanks for the comments! All appreciated.\r\nThis font was designed with
    some uses in mind: book jackets, posters, stylish magazines,\r\nand eventually,
    other uses that most of our library doesn't offer.\r\nRegarding the layered system
    we didn't what to copy ourselves, because I've done that with Braga and recently
    with Prumo Poster, and also because it was a constrain that we didn't wanted the
    font to deal with.\r\nThe main issue with this font is: how it's possible to kern
    between stylistic sets (and we did that for 9 ss)? \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDino dos Santos\r\nDSType"
