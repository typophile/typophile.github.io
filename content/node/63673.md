body: "right after i got CS3 in 2007 i created a corporate design for an international
  organisation. i was really positively influenced by the options that came with the
  <em>hypatia sans</em> font and made it the central font in the design, using it
  in a mutlitude of variations for titles, headlines, bodytext from logodesign to
  magazines, letterheads, annual reports etc. - all this believing that the font (including
  the itallics) would be available within short time. \r\n\r\nThe CD was highly acclaimed
  by the customer and i did quite a lot of follow-up designs since then. by now, though,
  my client needs to do regionalised layouts and other stuff in departments all over
  the world - so here i stand not willing (and not allowed) to pass on the font, but
  not able to supply my client with a satisfying solution. \r\n\r\nhere's my question:
  what would be good fonts do replace <em>hypatia sans</em> or assist it (as i won't
  change logos and frontcover-designs for the sake of continuity)? \r\n\r\nto make
  it easier: i only used the stylistic set 1 (i.e. sans serif) and (for headlines
  etc.) the set 13 (unicase). but i used all 6 weights. i used proportional and tabelar
  medivial numbers, too.\r\n\r\ni wouldn't mind to get suggestions for itallics, too,
  as they are afaik still not out yet.\r\n\r\ni would be really thankful for some
  suggestions.\r\n\r\ngerhard"

  body: "Gerhard,\r\nWhat does your client need:\r\nA license to use Hypatia?\r\nOr
    characters beyond what's included in Hypatia?\r\n\r\nIf it's the first, we do
    expect to have Hypatia available for regular licensing soon. There's been a delay
    while finishing the Italics, but those are now done and the final layout feature
    work in going on.\r\n\r\nIf it's the second, please explain in more detail. Hypatia
    has broader language coverage than most fonts, so I'm curious what else is needed.\r\n\r\n-
    thanks,\r\n  David L"

    Gill Sans and familiar fonts this way.\r\n\r\n> <em>david L</em>\r\nactually it
    is the licensing that troubles me. one of the reasons i picked Hypatia was that
    it comes with excetional language-support. but there's no use for a broad language-support
    if the client can't license the font :)\r\ndo you have a clue what <cite>\"available
    for regular licensing soon\"</cite> means - is this weeks or months? \r\ni really
    love that font and it suites my customer perfectly - i'd rather wait some time
    than switch and change the whole design with all the complications that come along.
    on the other side i'm a bit nervous as i might be running out of time (and my
    customer out of patience).\r\nbut thanks for your information - at least that
    is a light at the end of the tunnel.\r\n\r\ngerhard\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I expect the fonts to be ready to ship by the end of the month - but when they
    will actually ship is less clear, and not under my control. There's definitely
    a light at the end of the tunnel, but I'm not sure how long the tunnel is! I wish
    I had more information for you, but I hope this is some help.\r\n- David L"

  body: "><em>david L</em>\r\nthanks so much \u2013 this really is light at the end
    of the tunnel and it seems worth waiting for the release. i hope adobe will not
    delay shipping too long (there are others waiting for the release, too, as various
    threads tell).\r\n\r\na followup-question appeared to me lately: i know that <em>Hypatia</em>
    works in office-applications but of course without support for the open type functions.
    do you know if there are plans to deal with (at least some of) the stylistic sets?
    e.g. for the specific organisation i mainly used the stylistic set 1 (i.e. sans
    serif \u2013 or dongleless as it appears to be called lately) and it would be
    handy if the client could license this set as a truetype-font. the same with the
    stylistic set 13 (i.e. unicase). other sets like the W-variants might not be as
    important, though i really love the multitude of varieties and use them for other
    clients, too. \r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\ngerhard\r\n\r\n"

    a type designer to modify the font as needed for their office environment. Adobe
    fonts allow modification in their EULA."
