  I work for started stocking <a href="http://www.icone.co.uk/clocks/font-clock-g270/established/sebastian-wrong/fontg270/">Font
  Clocks</a>, like the office clocks you'd get in banks here in the UK, but they've
  got 12 fonts that cycle through and mingle together rather than purely Helvetica.
  As far as I know, there's three sizes (I've got a mid-size one on order, the big
  one's too big for my house!)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/big_6575.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/medium_5386.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/titchy_6667.jpg]<!--break-->As
  far as I know, I don't think <a href="http://www.icone.co.uk/clocks/font-clock-g270/established/sebastian-wrong/fontg270/">ic&#244;ne</a>
  can deliver to the US :( but I know they deliver Europe-wide...

  body: Well, I love "flip clocks" to begin with, so this is definitely an eye catcher.
    But in all honousty, I prefer the "clean" look of the all Helvetica ones. Still,
    I wouldn't turn of of these babies down ;-)

  body: I'll post a couple of pics online when it arrives... looking forward to taking
    delivery. I know what you mean about the all-Helvetica flip clock, I came close
    to buying myself one a few years ago (I think Habitat used to do small ones).
    There's a few bizarre choices of typeface on this one, it's like they got their
    mitts on a Letraset catalogue from the 80s!

  body: "Habitat still has the big ones now with the day & date on it as well (at
    least here in Belgium), but I have my heart set on a simple clock without any
    dates. I like this one:\r\nhttp://www.littleclockshop.com/giant_wall_flip_clock.html\r\nAnother
    one I immediately fell in love with is this one:\r\nhttp://www.urbanjunkie.co.uk/product.php/396/0/\r\nI
    just love those legs!\r\nIf you like clocks in general, you might want to check
    this link out that a friend mailed me a while back (she thought it would be the
    perfect way to get me out of bed)...\r\nhttps://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/ProductDisplay_Clocky%20Alarm%20Clock_10451_10001_34315_-1_11524_11532_null_shop\r\n;-)"

    ($1600). Even the small one is \xB1 \u20AC250,- ($335)."

  body: "> I found them somewhat expensive for a clock.\r\n\r\nI agree - they're what
    my gran would call 'a dear do'. But I think they're pretty different and I decided
    to treat myself! I think the reason they don't deliver to the US of A is that
    once taxes and delivery have been added, it turns into 'a really dear do'\r\n\r\nStill,
    at least the Helvetica Film is showing across the pond... I'm hoping that it'll
    get shown in Nottingham, England sometime soon!"
