  some new looks on it . So load your guns and start firing your critiques on it.
  I already think that I have some problems with the thick and thin in the lighter
  weights\u2026 I really used to like the way the connections are joining, at first.
  But now I have some doubts about it\u2026 Does it look legible and aesthetic to
  you ? Any remarks are welcome, thanks in advance ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@stewf Ditto. Re-opening it helped. \r\nEDIT Actually, I opened it in Acrobat.
    Sorry.\r\n\r\n@docunagi Interesting idea. Following through on that deep cut in
    the curves takes some guts. \r\n\r\nIt seems a little heavy handed in the light
    weight of the type though. It almost looks like a rendering error or printing
    error when looked at from normal reading distance, because the line almost drops
    off completely. It works a little more successfully in the regular to darker weights.\r\n\r\nYou
    need to make sure that all of your postscript outlines are merged in the final
    product, as I am seeing a whole lot of overlap that cancels out parts."

    don't know why it crashes preview. I guess it has something to do with the password
    protection of the file\u2026"

  body: "Nice, I like it. It looks quite similar to the light weight I'm designing
    for my typeface [[http://typophile.com/node/37075|Furet]] (sorry, that thread
    isn't really up to date at the moment).\r\n\r\nI'm not really digging your a,
    h, m, n, r, s, u. Going into that:\r\n\r\na -- I think the sudden angle of the
    shoulder (top right) is a bit too angular for the typeface.\r\nh -- I miss the
    notch.\r\nm -- Sticking on the second arch to an n doesn't work.\r\nn -- Also
    misses the notch.\r\nr -- I think the ear should start a bit lower.\r\ns -- Interesting
    place to put the notches, but not very consistent when compared to the other characters.\r\nu
    -- Missing the notches as well."

  body: "Thanks for the remarks;)\r\nI think after looking at it again that the notches
    are nothing but troubles\u2026 they does not bring that much\u2026 I'll try too
    simplify the whole thing and put notches only were they can bring something essential.
    Will let you know of the progress."
