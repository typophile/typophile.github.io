  body: 'I think it&#39;s a PR job more than a redesign job. I don&#39;t find it sad
    at all.  <BR> <BR>I agree with Hrant though that she could use a butt lift as
    well. And while they&#39;re at it, they should work on her profile too. A nicer
    nose perhaps ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Her enhanced boobs seem to make her head look too
    small now. '

  body: They could just submit this angel for an Extreme Makeover! As I see it if
    she is going to get the upper body done, and get a new booty, she may as well
    have her calves reshaped too. =D <BR> <BR>I actually prefer the androgyny of the
    first. Angels can be male as well.

  body: '&#34;Howcum&#34; No pun intended I hope ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I think it was a
    good move. The other is way too androgynous. <BR> <BR>If the goal is to have this
    person resemble a women, I think they took the right step. <BR> <BR>Plus, c&#39;mon,
    we all love bigger '

  body: Nah, that was just me venting my ongoing frustration  <BR>with the depiction
    of the female body in any and all  <BR>media. How does the saying go? <BR><i>Don&#39;t
    read beauty magazines,  <BR>they&#39;ll only make you feel ugly.</i> <BR>This
    might seem like taking it a bit far with this logo,  <BR>uvcurz. <BR> <BR>I do
    agree with Tiff, I preferred the androgynous version. <BR>Why does crass commercialism
    need to sexualize  <BR><i>everything?</i> &#40;because it works, yeah, I know...&#41;

  body: By the way, this article was originally from The Sun. I tried posting a link
    but it wouldn&#39;t work presumably because of the two commas in it. <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: It looks like the original was meant to be androgynous. I think it looked
    more male than female. The head shape, for example, is pretty square - kind of
    like a Ken doll..ya know? <BR>It just seems like another case of a client misinterpreting
    what the designer was doing. <BR>

  body: okay, i&#39;ll admit it, i just had to post here to get my name on a string
    that had the words &#34;boob job&#34; in the heading. i thought that the original
    angel was male as well, i&#39;m thinking if they&#39;re gonna give it boobs, they
    might as well finish the sex change and make it totally female. as it is she&#40;he/it&#41;&#39;s
    still an ungly angel now, just one with a bigger bustline. i think the new logo
    is worse than the original and by giving the angel boobs they just  made it&#39;s
    gender more confusing. anyhow, just thought i&#39;d ad my two cents.
