  when searching for a dingbat, for example a picture of a telephone, using charmap.exe,
  I scroll thru the list of fonts to find a dingbat font, then painfully squint to
  find the right dingbat character. There has to be an easier way :)\r\n\r\n1) Is
  there a program I can buy which makes dingbat font management easier?\r\n- I do
  not create fonts and not aware of the font management apps out there\r\n\r\n2) Is
  there a way I can easily print out the dingbats in each font?\r\n- The difficulty
  is that many dingbats are triggered with non-roman characters.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\n"
