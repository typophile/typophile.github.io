  Bodoni Light at 9.25pt for the body copy. I'd like to switch to something more legible
  but they'd like to stick to Bodoni. I realize that Bodoni and small copy aren't
  exactly the best match. Does anyone know a version of Bodoni (or a similar font)
  that is better at smaller sizes?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Bodoni</a> comes in three different [[optical size|optical sizes]]; \u201872\u2019
    for large display type around 72 points, \u201812\u2019 for text sizes like 9
    to 16 points, and \u20186\u2019 for really tiny things like captions or footnotes.\r\nF"

  body: "Sumner does nice work. If, for whatever reason, you don't like that, traditionally,
    when Bodoni is used in text, the usual one to use is Bodoni Book. Back in the
    older PostScript Type 1 days, I thought Linotype Bodoni Book was best for roman,
    Monotype Bodoni Book for italic. It has been a while, maybe they have been revisited
    & improved.\r\n\r\nHere is a (new) Linotype source:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=201727\r\n\r\nBerthold's
    Bodoni Antiqua is another candidate, esp. if you want old-style figures. As I
    remember, the regular weight works OK for text, but not quite as well as a good
    book weight."

  body: ITC Bodoni 6 is one of my favorite typefaces. It's so chunky! Not like those
    other anemic Bodonis out there.
