body: "I remember reading about two years ago a short (maybe 15-page) scholarly account
  of the interactions of Baskerville and Benjamin Franklin. I'd found it as a PDF,
  and it had inset pictures and illustrations. \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure it was this,
  but I'm not positive:\r\n[[http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/default.asp?resource=4626]]\r\n\r\nAt
  any rate, I was hoping to find it as a PDF (need to show it to someone), but I can't
  find any online. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? Thanks. "

    in which Franklin writes Baskerville about his prank is:\r\n\r\nJohn Nichols,
    <em>Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</em> (London: Nichols & Son and
    Bentley, 1812), 3: 454-55.\r\n\r\nI quote it in my article 'Readability and Revival:
