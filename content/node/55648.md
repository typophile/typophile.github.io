  Fraktur sorts. I bought some of them and searched for a computer typeface which
  looks similar.\r\n\"Old English Text MT\" looks almost identical so my question
  is:\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know if and when this typeface or a similar one were used
  for letterpress printing? I would really like to date these sorts so I would be
  glad if anyone could help me!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot and with kindest regards,\r\n

    made faces along the lines of \"Old English.\" If I recall right [my source books
    are buried at home], Monotype Old English was available in a range of sizes.\r\n\r\nATF
    made numerous faces in this style. Among them are Typo Text, Waldorf Text, Engravers
    Text, Wedding Text, Shaw Text, Engravers Old English, American Text, and Cloister
    Black.\r\n\r\nMostly in the USA these were used for \"society\" printing: wedding
    invitations, calling cards.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'd say many of these are actually
    very close to true Frakturs. European foundries made in metal some faces closer
    to true Frakturs, and I think some American foundries did also.\r\n\r\nAs for
    your desire to \"date these sorts\", perhaps you can proof them or photograph
    them and put up something for us to look at.\r\n\r\npowers"

    crappy.\r\nI can tell that they don't have any signatures (like here: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Gu%C3%9Fmarke_DSCN0493.jpg&filetimestamp=20070807042146)
    and that they are made of lead.\r\n\r\nThe dealer said he found them on a local
    junkyard.\r\nSince this kind of \"wedding letterpress printing\" isn't that widespread
    here in Germany so I guess they were once manufactured for the usage in a \"real\"
    printing company.\r\n\r\nDo you know some kind of a overview of typefaces of the
    Old English family so I might try it on my own?\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\n RoyBasch"

    metal types, was an adaptation, to use a polite word, of the \u2018Cloister Black\u2019
    or \u2018Cloister Text\u2019 of American Type Founders, which appears in their
    specimen book of 1906.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF Cloister
    Black 1 - 500_6257.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis was the ATF version, with which Morris Fuller
    Benton was associated, of some genuine textura gothic types, like Priory Text,
    that were cast at that time in US and British typefoundries, mostly originating
    in the 18th century but based on types used in old English printing. \r\n\r\nMaking
    the new type meant \u2018modernizing and removing the irregularities of\u2019
    the historic faces, as Mac McGrew rightly says. It\u2019s well done, but some
    people might think that all the life of the original type has been eliminated
    along with the irregularities. I do. But there doesn't currently seem to be much
    choice, either among digital types or metal ones.\r\n\r\nFraktur is a different
    kind of gothic.\r\n"
