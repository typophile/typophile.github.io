  \"Advertising Gothic Deco\" Font? I bought the font but the typeface appears to
  have been scanned from a document rather than re-drawn.\r\n\r\nHere is the link:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=adgothicdeco&Category_Code=]]\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRon

  body: "I think it's derived from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/advertisers-gothic/|Advertiser's
    Gothic]] which was designed in 1917. I have not seen this \"Deco\" version in
    any of my books, including McGrew's book on American metal types. I think it's
    true that Scriptorium (Dave Nalle) got a lot of his fonts from scanning specimen
    books, but at least my library doesn't seem to have this flared version of the
    typeface. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Mike, you jogged my memory. The source for "Advertising Gothic Deco" is a
    set of initials sold by Barnhardt Brothers & Spindler (BB&S) called "Publicity
    Initials". It's on page 341 of their 1925 catalog. The original design shows reverse
    letters only. The non-reversed version is apparently derived from that by Nalle.
    BB&S is also the source of Advertisers Gothic and Publicity Gothic.
