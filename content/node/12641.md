body: "I see that some people in this forum use Corel Draw for generating fonts (Mr.
  Twardoch, for example). I am a Corel user since version 3 and I find it to be THE
  tool for many graphic needs. I used it in conjuction with Fontographer to generate
  my fonts. I want to know if there are some specific suggestions for exporting EPS
  from Corel into FontLab in order to avoid any grievances such as odd sizes or corrupt
  data. With Fontographer, EPS would grow or shrink in order to fit in the type cells,
  which would produce periods as big as majuscules. Are there any known issues to
  deal with using FL?\r\n\r\nI am using version 12 on XP."

    for me. I am asking as to where there are specific recommendations for making
    a swift transportation of files between Corel Draw and FontLab."

  body: There is no method for "swift transportation"; the letters have to be exported
    as EPS one at a time, and imported into FontLab, one at a time.

  body: Is there no efficient way of avoiding the different scaling glyphs as they
    -big and small- tend to occupy all of the space available in each glyph cell?
    That used to be a drag with Fontographer. I generate the font directly from Corel
    normally and then open the font in the font editor, but perhaps there's been an
    improvement with Fontlab. Or hasn't it?
