    Virginia.  We always get a HUGE spike on hits supposedly from here because both
    UUNET and AOL are here in Fairfax County Virginia &#40;5 miles from me&#41;. The
    trouble is, there are boatloads of people from all over the USA using AOL and
    generating an Eastern Timezone IP even if they are from Alaska. I&#39;ll bet if
    you totalled all  the Eastern Time hits and subtracted non-eastern AOL and UUNET
    IPs, you would get a much smaller number. <BR> <BR>ChrisL <BR>PS: Either that
