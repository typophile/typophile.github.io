body: "Can anybody tell me how to combine the 'Caron' with an 'E' in a font that does
  contain the accent but hasn't a glyph that combines the two? My keyboard is set
  to UK English and I am on a Mac.\r\n\r\nI have the same question for activating
  other glyphs and diacritics in the same font that contains them, but I don't know
  how to use them when typing.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: If a precomposed diacritical glyph does not exist in a font, then your second
    option is to see if the font contains a 'combining mark' eg. the combining caron
    at Unicode 030C.
