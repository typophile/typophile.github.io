body: When it comes to down to my neighborhood, I think of antique stores with big
  letters and fancy script to show age and importance. When you live on a street named
  Magazine, the fonts better grab the attention of people. It does seem that the boutique
  shop lined street of Magazine really could be a well layed out print magazine intertwined
  with restaurants and residential housing. The font on every store window or sign
  is carefully selected in order to draw people in and that is what amazes me about
  font and the ability for it to make or break a business or even neighborhood. The
  power of font is one that most do not realize but as I learn and study more I've
  come to understand, font is just another layer of who you are.

  body: 'Magazine is a pretty unique spot being that the shops appeal to so many different
    types of people. I agree that just looking at the sign does let you know who shops
    there, very similar to what I said a few weeks ago about the restraunts. Just
    by the way a store presents itself through it''s logo and style of advertisement,
    a person can automatically tell what the clientel of the store is like. The stores
    on Magazine appeal to hipsters, yuppies, tourists, old ladies that are antique
    shopping, all of which can be fore told by the signage in any particular window
    of the store. '

  body: "Almost every sign on Magazine Street in New Orleans has been hand painted
    by the Mystic Blue Sign Company.\r\n\r\nSome were designed by local designers,
    Tom Varisco and Adam Newman in particular.  According to local membership in AIGA,
    the national association for design, there may only be 40 professional designers
    around.  If you have a moment stop into Mystic Blue.  Eve, the proprietor, is
    a master typographer\u2013she was once courted by Microsoft for her type knowledge.\r\n\r\nEve
    is also a master engraver but, she told me, she could not make a living at engraving
    when she moved to New Orleans so she opened up her sign shop instead.\r\n\r\nLocal
    economy dictates the choices that we make.  And the look of our streets in the
    signage we have, too."
