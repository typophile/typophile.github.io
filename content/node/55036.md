  body: "Hi and yes we need more information. This project is using an existing Logo?
    Can we get a look at it? 3D can be achieved using photoshop and depending on the
    complexity of the final artwork this can take a pro anywhere from 2 hours to days.
    General fees for photoshop artists range from $40.00 to $120.00 an hour. Printing
    for the sign is all over the place depending on the materials. For the average
    4x6 foot banner on vinyl costs can be from $400.00 and up.  I am in Canada so
    the prices I know are in CDN.\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell you could safely estimate
    anywhere from $1000.00 to $2000.00 \r\n\r\nTo be safe put out a job post and see
    what kind of quotes you get on artwork and printing.\r\n\r\nhope this helps.\r\n\r\ng."

    \"rendering\" of the logo.\r\n\r\nyou definitely need to provide more info Sisy.\r\n\r\nCheers<br
