body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nsomething that has been bothering me recently is the discussion
  of the value of designing prose. Throughout history, the designer has always been
  a necessary part of the production of prose. The working method is usually choosing
  a typeface and setting the type. And by tradtion, typography in modern prose is
  in most cases what Beatrice Warde would call the Crystal Goblet \u2013 a perfect
  transparent vessel in which the fine wine (the writer's text) is contained. \r\n\r\nBut
  with the rise of the digital book, where the reader can freely choose his/her typeface
  of choice, decide a typesize that suits the reader etc, the role of the designer
  in prose becomes quite tricky. \r\n\r\nWhat can the designer actually do for prose
  that cannot be done by a robot for example? Is all he/she can do is apply typographic
  \"rules\" and conventions to a text? Does an \"informed choice\" of a typeface affect
  the reading process?\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion?"

  body: "When I taught a course in book design, the first assignment I gave my students
    was to bring in a book that they thought was especially well designed--or especially
    badly designed--and tell the class why they thought so. The purpose of this exercise
    was to show that books don't just happen. Books look the way the do because somebody
    made a series of decisions, some better than others. The goal of my course was
    to equip students to make those decisions well. \r\n\r\nGraphic designers have
    not, in fact, been necessary throughout history. The term \"graphic designer\"
    was coined less than a century ago by W.A. Dwiggins. All the decisions associated
    with book design--choosing a style and size of type and arranging it on the page
    with suitable linespacing, margins, headers, etc.--were made quite competently
    by printers until the introduction of the Linotype and Monotype machines in the
    1880s.\r\n\r\nThe Linotype and Monotype were the first steps toward automating
    page production, a process that has evolved to the point where these decisions
    can be made, if not by robots, then at least without human intervention. It's
    the typographic equivalent of fast food: Quick, cheap, and good enough for many
    customers. \r\n\r\nBut there will always be customers for whom the one-size-fits-all
    product isn't good enough, and they will want professionals who know how to make
    custom-tailored designs for specific works of prose."

  body: Ebook standards are currently a mess. Mr. Bringhurst briefly discussed this
    in defending why the fourth edition of his book gave little information on type
    for web. Those of us who have tried ebooks have found that not only does it limit
    typographic choices, but images (particularly vector based) and tables (especially
    with rotated cells) are very limited. PDF documents look great (assuming a very
    high resolution monitor) but have no reflow options with current standards. Although
    technically one can embed fonts in an ebook, most readers cannot use them. I think
    the whole thing will be resolved with some future standard, but currently, ebooks
    are not a good medium for professional typography. (not to mention the issues
    of reading them on computers, iPads and other devices and even smart phones, and
    competing standards for delivery)

    \r\n\r\n <cite>Throughout history, the designer has always been a necessary part

    before then were compositors. And one large reason the owners of printing establishments
    gave way to the new layout men was economic -- the owners got more work out of
    their typesetters when a lead comp didn't have to (get to) spend time designing.\r\n\r\nGive
    the first couple chapters of Steer's <cite>Printing Design and Layout</cite> a
    read sometime...\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Steer\r\n\r\nAs for
    digital editions, it is early days. Where it is all going, who knows? The worry
    about robotic design is the least of the interesting issues that will be resolved.
    More interesting, for example, is what will happen to *publishers*? It always
    amazed me that the initial pricing for ebooks was a bit higher than for the mass-market
    edition. What happens when that changes?\r\n\r\nWe could even see a time when
    you buy the digital edition for the text only, have it printed out to taste --
    maybe after your own personal designer has selected typeface, measure, trim --
    have initials drawn in (by hand or computer), choose your own binder...oh, wait,
    we've sorta kinda done a portion of that a couple hundred years ago..."
