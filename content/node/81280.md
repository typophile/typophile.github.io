  You know how a few glyphs automatically get two codepoints because they appear in
  Latin-1/Mac junk and also in the Greek block? Now, say you open Tools:Actions because
  you want to slant every glyph 8 degrees, for instance. If you check "Apply to entire
  font", the action will be applied <em>twice</em> to any glyph with with two codepoints.
  The mu, Delta, and Omega will be slanted 16 degrees. Depending on how subtle the
  effect is, the difference could escape your attention for a while.

    select all glyphs and then apply the transformation, but *only* if I'm viewing
    the font in codepage mode -- if I switch to names or index mode (in which case
    mu etc. only appear once in the window) this doesn't occur.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: That must have been how I did it, then. As I implied, I didn't notice it until
    a little while later, and my memory hadn't distinguished the two methods before,
    because one would expect the result to be the same.
