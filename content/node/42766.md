body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI define my html headings and headers using:\r\nfont-family: \"Arial
  Narrow\", \"Helvetica Narrow\", Arial, Helvetica,\r\nsans-serif\r\n\r\nHowever,
  according to the screen captures I've done at\r\nbrowsershots.org Linux machines
  display this using very wide metrics\r\nindeed, to the extent that the number of
  characters per line on a\r\nLinux machine is roughly half the number of characters
  per line\r\ndisplayed on Windows and Mac machines when viewing the same web page.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a reasonably narrow headline (sans serif) font that comes as\r\nstandard with
  Linux which I could use as a substitute for Arial Narrow/\r\nHelvetica Narrow?\r\n\r\nDave\r\n\r\nPS
  - I've noticed that Wikipedia uses a reasonably narrow font for\r\ntheir main article
  headings, but (a) I can't work out what font-family\r\nthey are using (their css
  files are a labyrinth and I can't make sense\r\nof them); and (b) I can't test how
  their headings look under Linux (I\r\nuse Windows), because Wikipedia has blocked
  browsershots.org using a\r\nrobots.txt file.\r\n\r\nDave"

    condensed weights of DejaVu Sans and of Nimbus Sans.

  body: 'Arial Narrow isn''t a default Windows font either (although it''s quite common
    as it comes with Office). I think it would be considered bad-form to rely on it
    for Web pages to work properly. '

  body: "Re. Thomas's post, how should I define the font-family in the css file in
    order to get the condensed Vera, DejaVu or Nimbus fonts to display? E.g. does
    one write:\r\n\r\n{font-family: \u201CVera Condensed\u201D, \"DejaVu Condensed\",
    \"Nimbus Condensed\"}?\r\n\r\n\r\nRe. dii's post, it depends what you mean by
    \"work properly\" - I have defined the font family of my heading and header styles
    to display Arial or Helvetica if Arial Narrow and Helvetica Narrow are both not
    present, so it will work properly to an extent on any machine with any of those
    four fonts installed. But having said that, if you can think of a narrow sans
    serif headline font that comes as standard on Windows machines which *don't* have
    Arial Narrow installed, and if you can think of a narrow sans serif headline font
    that comes as standard on Mac OS machines which don't have Helvetica Narrow installed,
    then I would be very grateful for this information.\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: "I don't know CSS; maybe you can figure it out if you download the fonts.\r\n\r\nHow
    did I forget to mention this? I looked at Wikipedia's stylesheets a while ago.
    I think the font was just set as \"sans-serif\", which I think is a soft link
    in some distros to another font, but squooshed so that it was 125% of it's normal
    width."
