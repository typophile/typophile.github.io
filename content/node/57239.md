  the navigation menu, taglines and section headers. The main body font is Arial.
  \r\n\r\nAfter shuffling through a lot of types I have converged to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/medium/|FF
  Din Medium]]. It has clean and precise geometrical feel to it, which is exactly
  what's needed (the \"real-time or ..\" header):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/din-1_5154.png]&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI
  was very happy with the result, but then I woke up the next morning and the lowercase
  L felt wrong. Too playful and distracting, especially in a longer text. So now I
  made two alternative versions, which I think fix this problem, and I am now stuck
  deciding between them :)\r\n\r\nFirst is a pseudo small caps. 16pt R in medium followed
  by the rest in 12pt bold:\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/din-3_3900.png]&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSecond
  one simply has the lowercase L straightened up:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/din-2_4956.png]&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo
  .. which one ? "

    on something of a very low value\r\n\r\nI wish I could elaborate on why this is
    not of a low value, but I can't. Just believe me for now that it <em>is</em> far
    more important than it may seem on the surface :-)"
