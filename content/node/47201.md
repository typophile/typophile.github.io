body: "I just installed leopard, fontlab was working fine until I did a restart (the
  first one since the update) and now I can't open any of my font files. Fontlab will
  open, but the top toolbar options are gone(on the mac toolbar) and it crashes when
  I click the start new font button.\r\n\r\nHas anyone heard of this happening before?"

  body: I think I recall that happening once. I would just do a reinstall, that should
    fix it. If you don't have your serial number anymore I think FL will give (sell)
    you a new one for five bucks.

    just trash the preferences and restart. (You will need the serial number)
