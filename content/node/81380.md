body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\ni can buy a \"Xerox Phaser 6140\" for around 200$ i was
  wondering if this is a good laser printer for type proofing and is xerox a good
  brand or should i look for something else?\r\n\r\nwhen looking at the specs it says:
  600 x 600 x 4 dpi. I'm a bit confused here, what does the \"x4\" mean...does this
  mean 2400 x 2400. Or is this more of a marketing gimmick?\r\n\r\nI'm on a really
  tight budget around 200$ max \r\n\r\nhttp://www.office.xerox.com/printers/color-printers/phaser-6140/enus.html\r\n\r\nthank
  you!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for replying Arno, unfortinatly i don't speak German but the site
    sure looks very interesting.\r\n\r\nLike mentioned i'm on a really low budget
    so i don't expect to get the best printer out there. Reason i'm asking about the
    Phaser 6140 is because i can get one brand new out of the box for 150 Euro's (seller
    lowered his price)its priced at around 350Euro's in the store.\r\n\r\nOnly thing
    is i'm a bit worried about the 600x600x4. Some info on whether to stay away or
    buy this printer would be of great help..."

  body: I haven't tried that particular model, but I've used a more expensive Xerox
    Phaser model that did a nice job. If you Google "Xerox Phaser 6140 review" you'll
    find quite a few reviews.

  body: The 6140 is a 600 DPI printer with true Postscript. Because it's a Xerox it
    should hold up well. Some people will complain that 600 DPI just isn't enough
    for proofing type, but I know some very good type designers who do just fine with
    archaic 600 DPI units, so don't worry about it.

    to full opacity. Sounds similar in concept to anti-aliasing on the screen.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.office.xerox.com/latest/XOGFS-17"

  body: "thank you all for replying...\r\n\r\ni think i'm going to buy it, its a good
    deal i guess for a brand new laser printer, also i'm still a student so if 600DPI
    is enough for good type designers, its good enough for me.\r\n\r\nthe cartridges
    appear to be quite expensive tho, around 100Euro's.\r\n\r\ni never owned a laser
    printer, but i do remember that when my ink cartridges on my inktjet printer ran
    out and i let it sit there unused for like 1 month my printer never worked the
    same again after putting in a new ink cartridge, according to the seller it was
    because the ink dried up or something i can't remember. Is this the same case
    with a laser jet printer...do you need to replace the empty cartridge as soon
    as possible for the printer to keep its crisp printing. Reason I'm asking is because
    as a student i don't always have a 100 Euro's to spare.\r\n\r\nagain thank you
    all for helping me in my decision "

  body: "Short answer: Laser printers are more economical to operate than inkjet printers
    in the long run.\r\n\r\nLonger answer:\r\nIn general, even the smallest laser
    printer toner cartridges last much longer than the ink tanks in desktop inkjet
    printers. For a single user, one toner cartridge can easily last over a year,
    though using it for type design proofing might be more intense. They won't gum
    up when left unused the way idle inkjets are prone to do, but there are some internal
    parts that have to be maintained, and under certain circumstances replaced, like
    the imaging drum. Those aren't cheap, but they're less than the whole printer.
    Just be sure to read the operator's manual thoroughly. A good laser printer, properly
    maintained, can provide reliable service for about a decade, sometimes more."

  body: The lifespan of an inkjet cartridge is measured in pages. The lifespan of
    a laser cartridge is measured in thousands of pages. And they don't streak, clog,
    etc. I actually used a color laser printer for most of my drafts in art school
    and saved a fortune over kids who used inkjets.

  body: "It IS common practice of printer manufacturers to initially load up printers
    with cartridges that contain far less toner (or ink, in the case of inkjets) than
    the regular ones you need to buy after the first ones run out. In some countries
    it is mandatory to point this out in the sales/promo material (I have seen instances
    where the difference was three or four times). You should look into that.\r\n\r\n(Isn\u2019t
    it wonderful that for some models, in combination with promotions/rebates buying
    a new printer is cheaper than buying a full set of ink/toner \u2014 and that the
    manufacturers have \u2018corrected\u2019 this anomaly by reducing the load of
    the first run cartridges? That\u2019s capitalism in optima forma!)"

  body: "I know that one factor that decided my purchase of a laser printer was that
    the cartridge with the toner was separate from the one with the selenium drum,
    so I did not have to waste a valuable drum every time I added more toner.\r\n\r\nConsumables
    cost is worth paying attention to."

  body: "Except from the text printing quality, there are two things, which are important
    with regard to the prints of text in my opinion:\r\n\r\n1. The duplex precision,
    because I think duplex is important for real proofing.\r\n2. The mechanical resistance
    of the toner.\r\n\r\nBoth is poor in case of my Samsung. I cannot fold the paper
    after the print without damaging the toner. It may sound freaky, but I am using
    an electric iron for reinforcing the toner in the edge of the folded paper (naturally
    only on the unprinted back!). Unfortunately the printer test magazines (online
    and printed) are very rare. The focus is often on the speed or other things, which
    are totally unimportant in my opinion. If the printer prints excellent, I would
    be even willing to wait twenty seconds per page. But I don\u2019t need a printer,
    that prints 30 pages per minute or more. I have heard, that Lexmark is very good
    with regard to the mechanical resistance of the toner (document-quality). Nevertheless
    I am happy with my Samsung.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows magazines, that thoroughly
    test laser printers, I am very interested.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Druckerchannel also
    has tested a cheaper Samsung B/W laser printer. And its text prints look better
    than the prints of my Samsung on the fotos, that are taken with the help of the
    microscope. For some of you it may sound abstract, to proof the quality with a
    microscope, but I think only in this way you can check, how big the equivalence
    of printed letter and the letter on screen is. If the aim is, to reproduce a letter
    in print as close to the original outline as possible, the microscope is very
    useful in my opinion. Unfortunately I only know Druckerchannel, that uses a microscope
    for the tests."
