  while I see one I like and this is such a case.\r\n\r\nI am having a hard time finding
  this particular monospaced typeface. I've went through all the online resources
  I could muster and now I turn to the experts. It has a slight Eurostile feel to
  it for me.\r\n\r\nAny help from the peanut gallery?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chin-Chin-Product-11_5641.jpg]"
