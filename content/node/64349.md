  body: i thought it was DTD Silvertone Woodtype Extra Condensed at one point as well,  but
    for me the 'C' isn't condensed enough and there is something about the 'S' that
    doesn't quite match.

  body: "Here's a rough overlay I just threw together in Photoshop of the two samples.
    The C does seem to be slightly wider and the top end of the S is slightly shorter,
    but the other characters look pretty much exact. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maticevski_4363.png]\r\n\r\nFunnily
    enough, when I first saw this sample it looked really familiar and I thought it'd
    be an easy ID, but it's proved not be any of the faces I thought it could be.
    If it's not Silvertone Woodtype, I'd love to know what it is."
