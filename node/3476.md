  <BR>Having come to identifying &#40;I hope that correctly?&#41; this font as being
  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/bordeaux-roman/" target="_blank">
  Bordeaux Roman</a>, a doubt has came up, as this text sample is from 1986, yet at
  MyFonts it is referred that this typeface has been designed in 1987, which has me
  wondering whether I may be mistaken with my IDing of the font actually?...

  body: The sample does seem to match Bordeaux from Letraset, but I believe that Letraset
    was making type products before digital fonts that we know today were used. The
    other consideration is that film types, which Letraset may have created or digitized
    were the dominant type technology from the 50&#39;s &#40;I think&#41; to the  late
    80&#39;s when digital PostScript &amp; TrueType fonts began to be widely available.
    Looking through a 1960 Photo-Lettering book I can see many super condensed Bodoni&#39;s
    that are virtually identical to &#34;Bordeaux&#34;. For example, a designer by
    the name of Tommy Thompson had a range of Bordeaux-like styles like &#34;Colonial
    Triple Condensed&#34;, which seems very similar.  <BR> <BR>I think the exact identity
    probably ought not to be as important as the fact that Bordeaux is a font you
    know that looks virtually identical to the sample, so isn&#39;t that enough?
