  <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=201\" title=\"Chinese & Japanese Style
  Type\">Chinese & Japanese Style</a>), but the work done on Abu Dhabi's official
  font is rather impressive:\r\n\r\n[[http://brand.abudhabi.ae/Sites/OBAD/Navigation/EN/SupportingElements/Typography/primary-font,did=88374.html|
  Abu Dhabi's New Font]]\r\n\r\nMost impressively, it manages to avoid the cheesy
  look <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=202&page=1\" title=\"Other Arabic
  fonts\">most Arabic-styled fonts</a> managed to trudge into and fits the brand rather
  well. I like the loops on the 'g' and 'y,' though I have to wonder what would happen
  if they tried to write any word that had a 'gy' together, like 'clingy.'\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you all think?"

  body: "I don't think it does avoid the cheesy look of other pseudo-Arabic fonts.
    And the use of extended connecting strokes with random dots above and below impedes
    readability by disrupting English words.\r\n\r\nI quite like the brand mark, though.\r\n\r\nThe
    choice of Nazanin as a companion Arab font is competent, but not inspired."

  body: "The brand strategy sounds good, but typeface? Trying to please English and
    Arabic reading audience seems short-sighted. Reading long paragraphs in that typeface
    will be a nightmare. Why not try and match a no-frills accepted Roman typeface
    with a contemporay Arabic typeface like many have succesfully done before. \r\n\r\nWe
    in India with its many languages have often tried to design a local-flavoured
    Roman typeface, rather unsuccessfully. Even at the cost of being called a pessimist,
    Rudyard Kipling's verse \"The East is East and the West is West/ The twain shall
    never meet\" comes to my mind immediately."

  body: It reminds me of the cheesy pseudo-Arabic letters that were on the <em>Arabian
    Nights</em>-themed Dungeons and Dragons supplements I had when I was in middle
    school. These letters would make a great swash set, but to get away from the cheese
    it needs a toned-down set of letters and some lighter weights.

  body: "It is definitely not designed as a body typeface. Words like \"moment\" in
    their example become a bit laborious to read and as hashimpm says, reading long
    strings would be terrible, so I'd imagine that they will be pairing it with a
    more legible typeface of some sort, but the site doesn't make that clear. \r\n\r\nWhile
    I do agree that fonts should live in their own cultures (the pages I linked to
    on dafont seem to exemplify that), this one does seem to have some good qualities.
    Especially, as James points out, if it had some lighter options and maybe a bit
    less arabian nights feel (the extended connectors could definitely be shorter),
    it could be more elegantly presented.  Ultimately, the biggest issue I see with
    the font is that it precludes the ability for them to put both arabic and english
    versions on the same page. I like how, if you squint, the Abu Dhabi font presents
    a similar feel to the arabic one they've paired it with, but it tends toward being
    too similar, to the detriment of legibility when combined. \r\n\r\nThe other thing
    I noticed was that the numerals on the font were stolen directly from Nazanin,
    which probably didn't help when weighting the english version. You don't usually
    see such direct \"borrowing\" and I'm a bit surprised.\r\n\r\n"
