  does anyone have any suggestions for a sans serif that has this hand-lettered quality?
  I've been looking for a while and everything looks too organized and machinelike.
  Am I best off just drawing the letters myself to get this quality? Is there a good
  place to find \"historical\" fonts?\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a stupid question; thanks
  for any help, though."
