body: "I've put together a document that does the calculations required for cross-platform
  vertical metrics. The calculations are based on the methods described by John Hudson
  in this thread: http://typophile.com/node/13081\r\n\r\nThis document was put together
  in iWork 09 Numbers and I've exported an Excel version so hopefully all the (simple)
  calculations have survived intact. Also thanks/apologies to Karsten L\xFCcke who\u2019s
  diagram I have \u2018borrowed\u2019 and butchered for my own needs. The document
  contains two methods: John Hudson\u2019s original method (under \u2018Best Practices\u2019
  in the previously linked article) and the revised method suggested by Read Roberts
  (under \u2018Update\u2019 in the article). As far as I understand the jury is still
  out on which method it is best to use. Default values in the document are all taken
  from John\u2019s original article and all values are positive so you should manually
  change them to negative figures when inputting them into FontLab.\r\n\r\nComments,
  suggestions and reworks are welcome!\r\n\r\nEDIT: The forum won't allow .zip or
  .numbers attachments so I have attached the Numbers version as a .txt file. You
  should be able to download it and change the suffix to .numbers to successfully
  open the file in iWork."

    be used inside FontLab Studio and set the metrics without manual editing :)

    and one or two options should be removed. Perhaps next week ...

  body: "I've written a Python macro for FontLab Studio 5 that calculates the linespacing
    values using the same method as the one that will be built into Fontographer 5.
    \r\n\r\nIt follows John Hudson's recommendations and refines them a bit. It assumes
    the default leading of 120% and distributes the LineGap so that as little clipping
    occurs as possible. \r\n\r\nI'm planning to add a simple user interface to it,
    and make it work across an entire family, but the current version only works on
    one single font: \r\nhttp://www.fontlab.net/downloads/NewLinespacing.zip\r\n\r\nI'll
    appreciate any feedback. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"
