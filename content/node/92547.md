  significant influence on architechture. \r\n\r\nI start off with fonts inspired
  by the Trajan column in Rome, I will cover Bauhaus and probably Jugend fonts. I'm
  considering including Johnston (the London Tube font), and also Futura (Ikea used
  it, so at least there's a link to furniture if not architechture).\r\n\r\nBeing
  Norwegian, I will also include Sindre Bremnes's beautiful Telefon font (based on
  lettering on the classic Norwegian telephone kiosks), which [[http://typophile.com/node/66441|has
  been discussed on Typhofile]].\r\n\r\nWhat other fonts should I include? Thanks
  a lot for any help!"

    letter as a work of art; observations and confrontations with contemporaneous
    expressions of art from Roman times to the present day.\" by G. Knuttel (Amsterdam
    Foundry, 1951). It illustrates and discusses the connections between typestyles
    and other cultural artifacts, especially architecture.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/64845\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It always seemed to me that certain compressed, early twentieth century typefaces
    had a bit of skyscraper in them, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?4BP\">Raleigh
    Gothic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?403\">Corvinus Skyline</a>.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, such styles initially date from the early nineteenth century, when they
    were developed for use in all-type fly-posters, providing a good way for a long
    name to make a sizeable impression in a limited width.\r\n\r\nRather than direct
    <em>inspiration</em>, types are <em>informed</em> (perhaps subconsciously) by
    multiple factors. In fact, it\u2019s the nature of design that it <em>addresses</em>
    multiple issues in an economic manner, killing many birds with one stone, as it
    were. With type, I would say that there are <em>in\uFB02uences</em> that stem
    from non-typographic design disciplines\u2014such as architecture\u2014and those
    that stem from fashions/trends in layout, and the design space opened up by new
    font production and printing/display technology.\r\n\r\nPresently, there is a
    vogue for all-cap sans headlines (often multi-line), and more recently, those
    all-cap settings are being made with compressed type styles. Architecture? Go
    \uFB01gure.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Richard Keijzer (Netherlands) has been creating fonts based on signage used
    to identify buildings; primarily art deco-ish, they all have 'mokum' as the leading
    part of their names.\r\n\r\nHere's his site; the fonts (which are free) are currently
    off-line:\r\n\r\nhttp://fontenwerkplaats.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nSomewhere buried
    in his blogs are photos of the buildings that inspired him.\r\n\r\nSome of his
    fonts can be found on free font sites. Their names are:\r\n\r\nMokum Betendorp\r\nMokum
    Cohen\r\nMokum Cohen Top\r\nMokum Expo\r\nMokum Giro\r\nMokum Oorkonde\r\nMokum
    Stad\r\nMokum_Tooneel\r\n\r\nLuc De Vroye has some more information here - he
    includes some fonts that I was unaware of:\r\n\r\n   [[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-45405.html]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
