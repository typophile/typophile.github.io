body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\n I've been working on a new identity for a young Irish independent
  Film Festival only in its second year. I've been undecided about  a symbol I've
  been working on for it and I remember when I first came up with the idea I was delighted,
  I think Ive spent so much time looking at it at this stage that it's starting to
  annoy me. Looking for fresh thoughts on the symbol as for now the typeface being
  used is Office. I'd be delighted for any positive/negative feedback/ideas..\r\n\r\nThe
  brand attributes include, Vibrant, approachable, Current, Energetic - Supportive.
  The festival is run by volunteers and all funding comes from sponsorship.\r\n\r\nThe
  client currently wants to run with a more aligned version of no.4, I however feel
  it looks very corporate and very un-'festival' like. This has been the arrangement
  they have been wanting to go with for quite sometime and most other ideas have been
  variations on this. \r\n\r\nForget colour for the moment, any thoughts and ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nShaun\r\ntwitter.com/sobei_"

  body: I should have probably mentioned the 'F' used within the symbol reflects the
    cut out tracks/cells in a film stri, example being image 1.

  body: The logos with the slope call to mind film better (the upright ones feel architectural
    to me) and also are closer to fitting the listed attributes IMO.

  body: I appreciate the attributes aren't really captured within the symbol, but
    the symbol they chose They've had they're heart set on since day one. Any other
    options that I had come up with have been turned down for what basically looks
    like image 4 except the logotype is horizontally aligned to the height of the
    symbol. I'm relying on colour and the overall brand identity which will be applied
    with the logo to capture vibrance etc. cheers your feedback

    card</a> or Braille lettering references, but not the film edge. Though I think
    you can get away with something as simple as taking the F and perforating it vertical
    stroke to make it look like a film edge.

  body: "I'm not sure that references to physical film are as relevant as they used
    to be; aren't most young independent directors shooting video these days? \r\n\r\nBut
    anyway, the versions that slope look more energetic to me, and I'd suggest italic
    type that matches the same angle. \r\n\r\nHave you explored putting the type inside
    the graphic? Maybe change the proportions so it's like a single frame from a movie's
    title."

  body: "Type in #4 works best, but logo is too busy. Logo #1 is very good. Although
    I might try to use F^3 because number 3 can be mirrored with very similar geometric
    shape. And to maybe make /F/ more similar to /E/ (inverted /3/) I might write
    it as /F./ on 3...\r\n\r\nBut to make it sufficiently fine to combine with type
    it would rather be inverted in a square. And use #4 type as mentioned."
