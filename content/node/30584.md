  Caract\xE8res de Charles X have been digitalised. What if, based on a book typeset
  in one of those (or the IMprimerie Nationale book of samples), someone recreated
  the fonts? What kind of copyright issue would there be? Could they be released for
  free or commercially under those names? \r\n\r\nI hear someone did that with the
  Romain du Roi, though! If anyone knows more about this, let me know.\r\n\r\nD."

  body: "Thank you very much for the reply but you got confused by my late reference
    to the Romain du Roi, which I don't really care for: it's a garalde, and I am
    interested in the Romain de l'Empereur which is a Dido(t/ne). It was later redrawn
    as Caract\xE8res de Charles X.\r\n\r\nAnother issue for which I have not found
    any reference is: what are the rules pertaining to copyright that would prevent
    me to digitise an old font found in a specimen book."

    post, which must be such a breach of every kind of online etiquette that I thought
    I would shut up for a while.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in there you will find my suggestion
    that the <em>Romain de l'Empereur</em> aka <em>Didot millim\xE9trique</em>, of
    which a full character set appears in the 1990 Imp nat specimen book, may be somewhere
    behind the heading font that appears in Le Typographe \u2013 http://www.typographe.com/
    I don't think that anyone has yet digitized the type Marcellin Legrand / Charles
    X. "
