body: "OK, pervasive terror now almost fully confined, I submit for the first time
  a typeface for critique. While I already know what some are likely to be, stating
  the following may reduce the number of obvious views:\r\n\r\n1.) This font will
  not be given or sold.\r\n2.) It is quite uneven - the capitals don't even match
  in style or size and many of the curves in all the letters are slightly different\r\n3.)
  Both cases of the letter \"S\" are absolutely disgraceful. Ignore if possible.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm hoping to obtain here is not an ordinary \"change this\" or \"try that.\" Instead,
  I am first merely wanting to know if I should permanently give up trying to design
  a typeface; second, if there are any particular aspects/letters off which I should
  build (i.e., the uc \"P\" is different from the \"B,\" so perhaps which looks better);
  third, if I've unwittingly designed something almost identical to some other typeface
  out there and; fourth, if I am missing something about typography as whole that
  screams from this font.\r\n\r\nThanks for any input, it all will be quite valued.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n"

    (weight) as well.

  body: I personally don't think it's bad. In my (very amateur) opinion, it's probably
    more of a display face than something you would use for body text, but the angles
    on letters like 'b' and 'u' make for an interesting effect. One suggestion I have
    is that it might look a little more uniform if (for example) you used the same
    general kinds of angles for 'c' and 'o' as you do for some of the other letters.
    I think I'll leave further critique for those with more experience and a larger
    typographic vocabulary.

  body: "I like it.  Keep working on it.  You are right, the S and s need to be thrown
    out and you need to start over. I would take the uppercase C, flip the bottom
    half, and use an upward (left to right) sloping diagonal at the same angle as
    the other letters. \r\n\r\nI particularly like the synergy between the diagonals
    in the 'yp,' 'yin,' and 'gin' letter combinations.  Keep that.\r\n\r\nThe P and
    B don't have to match.  They both look fine. \r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to see
    upper and lower case at the same point size.\r\n\r\nI'd say design the numbers
    and punctuation next, and then kern it. \r\n"

    go rather nicely in that context. (See e.g. http://blambot.com/ )
