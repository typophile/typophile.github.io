    fonts. For some more inspiration check out Need For Speed Most Wanted, there's

  body: "I could not find this at Dafont or MyFonts. Bad news for you -- these fonts
    are like hand-printed ones, that is, anyone can make them. My advice is not to
    try to find exact match. Search \"graffiti\" or \"tagging\" and pick something
    that feels similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
