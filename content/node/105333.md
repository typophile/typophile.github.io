  body: Well, if we take an anthropological view of culture as a system of tools and
    codes for interpreting and interacting with each other and the surrounding world,
    then typography is very much an aspect of culture, as well as being entirely contingent
    on culture.

  body: "I\u2019d suggest that you first look for a proper definition of typography.\r\nWhen
    typography is writing with predefined / prefabricated letters* and take the definition
    of culture as suggested before, then the following questions may come in mind:\r\n\r\n1.
    How does culture interact with creating typefaces?\r\n2. How does culture interact
    with the relationship between script and typefaces?\r\n3. How does culture interact
    with script?\r\n4. How does culture interact with the way typefaces are used (typography)?\r\nAlso,
    you\u2019d probably have to think about which cultures / scripts you want to include
    in your paper and in how far historic / technical developments should play a role.\r\n\r\nAll
    very interesting, but maybe you\u2019ll have to focus a bit and tell us what you
    came up with. When you are looking for a debate on how to define topography, you
    might find something here: http://typophile.com/node/2812\r\n\r\n*definition by

  body: I think another pair of interesting avenues are the existence of scripts and
    typography in invented cultures as well, like Klingon, hobbit, and etc. quite
    a bit, and then the cultures where we have little or nothing left of their cultures
    except their scripts in composition, like Mayan, Hittite, Harappan, or my favorite,
    Voynichian.

  body: "Sonica: \u2018<em>How typography and culture are related? do cultural in\uFB02uence
    typography?</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nFor the completeness of your paper it might be important
    to come up with a proper definition of typography, as Albert Jan suggests. Noordzij\u2019s
    one is often referred to nowadays, especially by his former students, and it was
    preceded by similar ones by for instance the Frenchman Loys Le Roi, who de\uFB01ned
    typography in the oldest known (very concise) publication on printing (type),
    which dates from 1576 (in 1594 it was published in London in an English translation):
    \u2018<em>[\u2026] the manner to write by imprinting [\u2026]</em>\u2019, and
    by Walter J. Ong, who stated in \u2018Comment: Voice, Print, and Culture\u2019,
    <em>Visible Language</em>, Volume IV, Number 1, (1970) pp.77\u201383 (p.80): \u2018<em>Alphabetic
    type commits the word to space even more than writing does. Writing makes words
    by creating marks on surfaces. Alphabetic prints makes words out of pre-existing
    things\u2013types, which are stored around like nails or bricks in boxes\u2013and
    made up into forms as bricks are made into houses.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nIn his <em>Manuel
    Typographique</em> the eighteenth-century punchcutter and theoretician Pierre
    Simon Fournier placed typography in a wider context by stating that it consists
    of \u2018<em>[\u2026] three parts, each distinct and indispensable, namely, punchcutting,
    founding and printing. The practice of the different branches produces artists
    of three different kind, the \uFB01rst the punchcutters, the second founders,
    and the third printers, but only who combines a knowledge of all three branches
    is \uFB01t to be styled a typographer</em>\u2019. \r\n\r\nBased on my <a href=\"http://lettermodel.org\">research</a>
    personally I would describe typography as <em>grid \uFB01tting of formalized letters</em>;
    the grid being de\uFB01ned by the natural rhythm of the applied type.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    for answering your question I think basically it\u2019s enough that we agree on
    talking about the same thing, and as such the term \u2018typography\u2019 is suf\uFB01cient
    for me. I concur with Johan that typography and culture are inextricably connected
    with each other, and subsequently interact. \r\n\r\nFor my talk at Leiden University
    on the progress of my research in 2009, I invited Ji Youn Kang, a graduated master
    student from the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague for a talk on the differences
    between Western and Korean traditional music. She explained (beautifully sung)
    the actual lack in Korean traditional music of what is considered to be harmony
    in Western music. Subsequently I made a comparison of what is considered harmony
    in Hangul and formal representations of the Latin script. Some brief related info
    can be found <a href=\"http://www.lettermodel.org/wordpress/?p=796\">here</a>.
    \r\n\r\nFor me the current Vietnamese writing system is a nice example of the
    fact that scripts can be simply replaced by ones from a different culture if required
    or demanded. A French decree was enough in this case. And the younger (South)
    Koreans are so much in\uFB02uenced by the Western music culture that they don\u2019t
    understand anymore the traditional Korean music.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"
