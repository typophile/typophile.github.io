  or carved raised letters often found on nineteenth-century apartment buildings.

    book (1920 +- I think): Architectural drawing and lettering. "

  body: "I generally spec them as  \"dimensional\" letters, as in \"router-cut aluminum
    dimensional letters\" if they are cut, formed as with channel letters or die-cast
    and attached to the wall \r\n\r\nI think that for carved stone or cast concrete,
    \"relief\" is appropriate."

  body: 'FWIW, in Egon Weiss'' <em>The Design of Lettering</em> (New York: Pencil
    Points Press, 1932), he differentiates between two categories, "incised" and "raised."
    He doesn''t seem to distinguish slightly raised and highly dimensional letters,
    though.'
