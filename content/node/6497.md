body: I looked at the &#39;Chicago Typophiles&#39; thread started by Will and thought
  it would be a good idea to make one of my own for the typophiles of NYC. Joshua
  Darden once told me there was a group that gets together at a bar in Soho once a
  month &#40;i belive it was the first thursday of every month&#41;. Maybe we can
  add to that group or we can start one of our own. Any takers? <BR> <BR>IM
