body: I&#39;m working on an OT font that had both short and long descenders. Ideally
  I would make this kind of thing a stylistic set, but no apps currently support stylistic
  sets &#40;to my knowledge, i could be wrong&#41;. In the meantime i&#39;m thinking
  the most appropriate feature to use for this would be the &#34;calt&#34; feature
  and having an indentical &#34;ss&#34; feature for when apps are made that support
  stylistic sets. is this the best solution? does anyone forsee any problems with
  this/have any suggestions?

  body: I don&#39;t know, I think you should make 2 separate fonts, but I guess it
    depends on whether it is a text face or a display face. Because, theoretically,
    you won&#39;t mix long and short descenders in a text block. But that kind of
    variation may be very interesting in display fonts. <BR> <BR>The problem with
    using &#60;calt&#62; to this kind of thing is that you won&#39;t be able to include
    &#39;real&#39; contextual alternates. Or, you can include contextual alts, but
    they&#39;ll only work with the alternate letters; and they&#39;ll <i>always</i>
    get activated with the alternate letters.

  body: Thanks for your comments, Eduardo. I guess I technically COULD make two separate
    fonts, but I thought it would work better as an OT feature. The face I&#39;m working
    on is a text face, not display. I guess my logic in justifying the &#34;calt&#34;
    feature is 1&#41; i have no other contextual alternates that these descender variants
    would interfere with. 2&#41; ideally these alternates would be truly contextual
    if features could rely on leading and switch to the short descenders when leading
    is decreased below a certain level, say below 120% of the point size.

  body: Contextual alternates won&#39;t work for this because you can&#39;t define
    the context in OpenType terms &#40;nearby glyphs&#41;. <BR> <BR>Personally, I&#39;d
    use stylistic sets. It&#39;s my firm belief that shoehorning glyphs into inappropriate
    features because of what apps happen to support this month is a bad idea. Stylistic
    sets are pretty much at the top of our list for next features to support. <BR>
    <BR>Failing that, make separate fonts. <BR> <BR>My two cents. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Paul,  <BR> <BR>put the alternates into &#34;ss01&#34; and into &#34;salt&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>Illustrator CS &#40;all versions&#41;, InDesign CS ME and Photoshop CS ME
    all support &#34;salt&#34;. The upcoming Microsoft WinFX architecture with support
    both &#34;salt&#34; and &#34;ssXX&#34;, I&#39;m sure other applications will add
    &#34;ssXX&#34; support as well.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam

  body: Charles knows better than I, but I do agree with him about usage. Since I
    am pretty sure you are talking about your Lanston Goudy Old Style, I would think
    that people are not likely to mix the regular and full descender versions in the
    same paragraph. So with two fonts they can just set two styles--such as for body
    text and footnotes--and go with it.
