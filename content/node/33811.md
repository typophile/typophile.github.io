  body: BTW, why do some attachments appear within the post, some with scroll bars,
    and some as attachment links you have to click on?

    \"Insert image\" link below the comment text box and upload the image to the Typophile
    server, your image will appear within your comment."

  body: "Thanks to all.\r\n\r\nTodd -- I did use the \"insert image\"\r\n\r\nI probably
    should start a new thread for this (or probably elsewhere) but I can only find
    Bellevue bundled with 2 other fonts, one of which I have and the other I don't
    want.\r\n\r\nAny ideas as to how I can get ONLY Bellevue?"

  body: Unless of course you use the Creative Suite. In that case Bellevue was bundled
    with it.
