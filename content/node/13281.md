body: "Well, I am my own boss now and I finally have a budget to build my font library.
  My current collection has a decent smattering of this and that, but I feel I'm lacking
  a complete sans family. While I anticipate Mark Simonson's <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/article/118/proxima-sans-going-nova\">Proxima
  Nova</a> family will provide an excellent choice for a geometric sans, I haven't
  settled on a humanist sans.\r\n\r\nI know there is a great variety out there, but
  I'd really like something in OpenType -- not just because of the features, but because
  I frequently switch back and forth between Mac and PC. Here are a few I'm considering:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFoIVisOT.php\">Vista Sans</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/sebastian.html\">Sebastian</a></li>\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11482.0.0\">Nexus
  Sans</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.secretonix.pt/ftf/catalogue/FTFstella.htm\">FTF
  Stella</a> and <a href=\"http://www.evertbloemsma.nl/legato/legato_family/legato_regular.htm\">FF
  Legato</a> are two that I especially admire -- I only wish they were availble in
  OpenType.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any advice from those that have used any of these
  or can recommend other options.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

    of features, or do you want a face that's a bit more subdued and versatile? I
    am a big fan of Sebastian, but it definitely has a lot of features and has a smaller
    x-height than many other humanist faces.\r\n\r\nIf versatility is what you're
    after, I'd say go for Nexus."

  body: "I agree with tbiddy about Nexus. But I'm a sucker for Dutch type (and Majoor's
    Scala), so take that into account.\r\n\r\nVista may actually be a more broadly
    applicable face, though. It's got a strong flavor of Meta to it, which I think
    might make it more readily accepted by people used to Meta's structure and character.
    Plus the alternate sets that Dupr\xE9 designed allow Vista to do some fun, interesting
    stuff that's unique to the family.\r\n\r\nLegato's got the high legibility thing
    going for it, but its design makes me think of <a href=\"http://www.eff.co.uk/M/P/PrsLR.htm\">the
    font used in the BBC series <em>The Prisoner</em></a> too much. I know, I'm weird
    like that. But I can't get past it, for some reason.\r\n\r\nIt's a tough choice
    between some great fonts that, as tbiddy said, is a matter of specfic desires."

    know you're a big fan of Legato, and I understand why. Perhaps I should look into
    a price break for buying a license for both Mac and PC...\r\n\r\nI suppose I am
    looking for something that's more neutral and not too terribly unique. Some might
    say that I'm looking for the Minion of sans serifs. I suppose that's why Stella
    appeals to me so much -- it's simply quiet and well-made."

    twice. A few years ago, when I was first just an exchange student in Germany,
    Linotype and the school I was studying at collaborated on a project. Students
    in this project created advertising & brochure proposals for the Vialog typeface
    (Werner Scheider, Vialog's designer, was the school's retired typography professor).
    So the fonts were given to the school for our use.\r\n\r\nSince working at Linotype,
    I have designed a few small ads and marketing materials (posters for conferences,
    etc) for Vialog.\r\n\r\nI don't think that Vialog is directly based off of any
    traffic signs. In the 1980s, Werner Schneider created a proposal for a European
    Highway signage face that was not put into use. During the 1990s, he reworked
    this face into Vialog, which became the house face of the Munich transit system
    before it became available for licensing. Since 2001\u20132, everything related
    to public transportation in Munich is set in this face (from signs down to the
    fold-up maps that fit in your pocket). This completed face, already tested and
    optimized for Munich, is available from Linotype as part of its Platinum Collection.\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    serif faces, I wonder if we all could start elaborating a similar list about the
    best contemporary serifs out there.\r\n\r\nLet me start (in no particular order):\r\n<ul>
    <li>Fedra Serif</li> <li>Dolly</li> <li>Sauna</li> <li>Enigma</li> <li>Delicato</li>
    <li>Andulka</li> <li>Collis</li> <li>Borges</li> <li>Whitman</li> <li>FF Quadraat</li>
    <li>Andralis</li> <li>Proforma</li> <li>Aquila</li> <li>Farnham</li><li>Arnhem</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hello! I just discovered this thread and I wonder why Versa Sans hasn't been
    mentioned yet. You can get it from <a href="http://www.ourtype.be">Ourtype</a>
    and there's also a serif version. Oh- and I think it's a beautiful font :-)

    new, well-crafted and complete - but most of all it's not utterly boring as the
    typical hum-sans is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
