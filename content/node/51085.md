  body: Just how it's laid out etc - I'm not 100% classically trained when it comes
    to type, it looks right to me but there might be some slight kerning issues or
    some rule that I haven't adhered to etc - if not, great!

  body: "here's a handy trick for kerning.  It's easier to kern letters you can't
    read, and youre so used to seeing not only these letters, but these words, that
    you often over-look the spacing even when you're trying to.\r\n\r\nSimple Solution:
    turn the type upside down.  The gaps will jump out at you instantly.\r\n\r\nHope
    this trick helps if you didn't already know it, I know it's saved me more times
    than I wish to admit..."

    in this ... the word \"in\" references to tokyo, whatever connection can be drawn
