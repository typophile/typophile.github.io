body: "Here comes a new experimental font based on 3d-molecules.\r\nThis is not just
  look-alike - these molecular structures really exist.\r\nUntil now I only developed
  the lower case letters. I don't know if I manage to design the capitals and numbers
  as well. That seems to be a more complicated task...\r\nLigatures seem to be quite
  logical however I think the readability would suffer - and to be honest, the readability
  is already bad.\r\n\r\nComments, critics and suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Molecules_font_example_4596.png]"
