  body: The Prada font is a custom, proprietary font. And the company has enough cash
    and lawyers to make your life hell. Stay away from this, is my advice.

    could use a font based on these letterforms to do mischief, but\u2026\r\n\r\nThe
    only way ANY lawyer could find you at fault would have to be EXACTLY the same
    way that a lawyer could find a handgun manufacturer at fault for supplying the
    means for someone to kill someone else. Good luck finding ANY case law to support
    that argument.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the logo isn't particularly innovative,
    nor does it REALLY contain anything which hasn't been done before. So\u2026\r\n\r\nMake
    the freaking font, but make ABSOLUTELY SURE that the /R and the /A ARE NOT EXACTLY
    LIKE the ones in the logo\u2026which should not be difficult to do.\r\n\r\nThis
    moment of sanity brought to you by the screwiest guy posting on this forum.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    Hrant: in this department, I am Number One\u2026"
