  within our production environment.\r\n\r\nSomewhere, somehow InDesign is associating
  a certain font with a font filename. I discovered this by having renamed a font
  family and reloading the font. InDesign was still showing the OLD font family name
  in its menu. All I had to do was to rename the font FILE and InDesign saw the new
  font family name.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where InDesign is storing such information?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nKen"

    delete them and they will be regenerated.

    know about but it didn't seem to work. Next time the problem occurs I'll try searching
    the entire hard drive again.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input and any other suggestions
    are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nKen"

    are quite a few hardcoded names (and even some re-encoding schemes) there, mostly
