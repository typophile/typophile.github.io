  the drawing provisions in Excel.  Have a look, if you would, and have at it.  Thanks
  in advance.

    there worth developing, perhaps?  \r\nFontLab is something I've considered but
    it's bloody expensive, especially for a novice.  Been searching for a used copy
    but no luck so far.  FontForge is something I'd need to research.\r\nThanks for
    your comments/advice."
