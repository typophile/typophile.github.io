body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI use the \"calt\" function for character substitution, and
  I have a lot of similar glyph lists which are sometimes hard do maintain.\r\n\r\nFor
  example, I have:\r\nsub m' [s a c e o] by m.alt;\r\nsub n' [s a c e o] by n.alt;\r\nsub
  x' [s a c e o] by x.alt;\r\netc.\r\n\r\nMy question is can I define a glyph list
  that I can use for every instance?\r\n\r\nCan I say:\r\n\r\nmy list_s = [s a c e
  o];\r\nsub m' [list_s] by m.alt;\r\nsub n' [list_s] by m.alt;\r\nsub x' [list_s]
  by m.alt;\r\n\r\nSo I if I want to add a character to that list I have to do it
  in one place, instead of, say 10 \r\n"

  body: "It sounds like you want to replace inline classes (glyph lists) with predefined
    classes. Your pseudo-code is already close, just ditch the 'my' and use the prefix
    '@'...\r\n<pre>\r\n@list_s = [s a c e o];\r\nsub m' @s by m.alt;\r\n# etc.\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn
    order for the class to work across features (not just for <code>calt</code>),
    the definition should be made globally, i.e. in the lower section of FontLab's
    OpenType panel, or in the Classes panel, or somewhere near the top of an external
    features file.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to nest classes, so if you needed to
    add an additional glyph to the predefined class for a particular rule, you could
    do something like...\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsub m' [@s u] by m.alt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n...which
    would include 'u' in the class for just that rule."

  body: " AFDKO syntax is described at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html\r\n\r\nI'd
    actually recommend you *not* think of this as a programming language, per se,
    but rather simply as the syntax for specifying the structure of OpenType tables.
    When I first started coding OpenType features I ran into a bunch of problems which
    were caused by viewing it as a programming language and assuming that lookups
    behave similar to functions, which is in various respects a poor analogy.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, consider the following hypothetical piece of code:\r\n\r\nlookup A {\r\n\_\_\_\_DoSomeStuff;\r\n}
    A;\r\n\r\nlookup B {\r\n\_\_\_\_DoSomeOtherStuff;\r\n} B;\r\n\r\nfeature xxxx
    {\r\n\_\_\_\_lookup A;\r\n\_\_\_\_lookup B;\r\n} xxxx;\r\n\r\nfeature yyyy {\r\n\_\_\_\_lookup
    B;\r\n\_\_\_\_lookup A;\r\n} yyyy;\r\n\r\nIn this example, feature xxxx and yyyy
    *must* behave identically because lookups, unlike functions, are not called. Rather,
    they exist within the GSUB table in a particular order and will either be processed
    by the application or not. This order is determined by the order in which lookups
    are declared rather than the order which they are referred to in the features.
    Thus, B will operate on the output of A even in feature yyyy where they are mentioned
    in reverse order.\r\n\r\nPrograms operate over data. OpenType tables, on the other
    hand, are static data which is processed by a text engine.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
