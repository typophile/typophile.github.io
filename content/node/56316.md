  Even though many browsers still do not support @font-face AND many foundries won't
  allow it, I think it would be useful. And I hate to get complicated, but can you
  copy/paste the information from the foundries EULA which states the accord?\r\n\r\nI'll
  start:\r\n\r\nFoundry: exljbris\r\nQuote: You may use this font for Font-Face embedding,
  but only if you put a link to www.exljbris.nl on your page and/or put this notice
  /* A font by Jos Buivenga (exljbris) -> www.exljbris.nl */ in your CSS file as near
  as possible to the piece of code that declares the Font-Face embedding of this font."

  body: "Great idea...\r\n\r\nAre you only interested in foundries that support both,
    or is this an either/or question.  Also licenses may be hard to understand - but
    FAQ's not so much. \r\n\r\nH&FJ case in point (for both points)...\r\n\r\n<CITE>What's
    involved in using fonts on websites?\r\n\r\nHTML doesn't offer any way to force
    a web page to render itself in a typeface that the viewer doesn't have, but fonts
    can be used to create different kinds of images:\r\n\r\n\u2014 Bitmap graphics
    (gif, jpg, png) There's no difference between using a font to create a printed
    page and using it to create a pixellated image. As long as the person creating
    the images has licensed the fonts, no additional license is needed.\r\n\r\n\u2014
    Vector art (swf) Because Flash files embed actual portions of a font's sourcecode
    within themselves, our font licenses require that designers observe some basic
    safety precautions when publishing Flash files. Text in Flash files must be static
    (not dynamic), the files must embed only a subset of the character set, and the
    \"Protect from Import\" option must be enabled when the files are generated.\r\n\r\n\u2014
    sIFR (Scalable Inman Flash Replacement) sIFR is a great technology that brings
    rich typography to the web through a combination of Javascript, CSS and Flash.
    To use an H&FJ font with sIFR, purchase an additional single-computer font license
    for the webserver itself, and then configure sIFR's customize_me.as file in two
    ways to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the system: first, set the allowedDomains
    array to include only the domain of your website (instead of \"*\"), and then
    set allowlocal to \"false\" before publishing the .swf to the web. \r\n\r\nThe
    emerging @font-face tag within Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) will hopefully lead
    to a secure technology that allows fonts to be used in web pages. But at this
    time, no such security measures exist, so the use of this tag with our fonts constitutes
    the illegal distribution of the font software. This type of use is therefore specifically
    prohibited under our End-User License Agreement.\r\n\r\nIf you are exploring other
    technologies that aren't covered here, please contact us at info@typography.com.\r\n</CITE>\r\n\r\nVia

  body: "To come back to the original idea:\r\n\r\n<strong>sIFR:</strong> \r\nThis
    would probably very useful for the users. Though a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" would
    not suffice since some foundries limit the use within Flash to static text fields
    and/or subsetting. \r\n\r\n<strong>What about PDF embedding?</strong>\r\nMany
    users are not aware that PDFs used online might require an additional license
    or might be limited to non-commercial PDFs.\r\nFor example Typotheque:\r\n<cite>A
    license extension is available at the cost of $350 per year that allows Typotheque
    fonts to be embedded in any read-only PDF document.</cite>\r\nOr our EULA at fonts.info:\r\n<cite>You
    need an additional license to produce commercial PDFs like E-Books or PDF magazines.
    </cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>@font-face</strong>\r\nThis would be useful although limited
    to EOT at the moment. As far as I know there is not one foundry yet that would
    allow @font-face in general for all fonts \u2013\_not even exljbris. \r\nAdobe
    (T. Phinney): <cite>Our current license terms allow for EOT usage (with a URL
    binding). Our license terms do not allow font linking to original format font
    files. </cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>Alternative technologies (like Typeface.js, Cuf\xF3n)</strong>\r\nWould
    be interesting to hear about those from the foundries, but current EULAs don't
    mention any of those technologies. But we could probably assume commercial foundries
    don't allow them, because they require the fonts to be converted and uploaded
    (without protection) to a public webserver.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    end up with people ripping font from them and distributing those fonts. That means
    fonts with a foundry\u2019s names trademarks on the outside and a bunch of degraded
    letters, bad OT code, and bad naming tables on the inside (similar to the bad
    pirate fonts that appear to have come from Flash files). And the less intelligent
