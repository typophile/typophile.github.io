  needs to contain both Latin (26) and Cyrillic (33) letterforms. What I need to know
  is what punctuation marks are essential to Russian other than those found in Latin?\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated.\r\n"

    typeface would contain all Windows 1251 encoding characters, not only 33 russian
