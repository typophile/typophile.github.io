    different, go straight to the source: commission what you want from Mark himself.
    He&#39;s around here, somewhere.'

  body: I&#39;ve thought about doing narrower versions of Changeling. Think there
    might be a market? <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, I was a bit shocked when I first saw that
    page on the ParaType site. Must be some kind of referral deal between them and
    MyFonts.&#41;

  body: How much narrower would you like it? <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, there&#39;s a bug
    in the engine that runs this forum. Sometimes, posting seems to fail, but if you
    check, you will see that it went through anyway.&#41;

  body: I love the fact that you designed that typeface Mark. I mean from what I know
    of your work it strikes me as the unsung jekyll next to your famous hyde. &#40;oh
    sheesh, pun not intended&#41;

  body: It&#39;s sort of a guilty pleasure kind of design. One of my earliest typeface
    designs &#40;never published&#41; was in the same vein. I did a digitization of
    China for a client in the late eighties. I got a lot of queries about it since
    I show it in my custom fonts section on my site and decided to do my own version
    of it which became Changeling. A lot of elements from that early type design ended
    up in Changeling. The other stuff you allude to &#40;Coquette, etc.&#41; is where
    my head is at now after thinking about type for 20 or 30 years. Changeling is
    me reverting to what I thought was cool when I was just starting out.
