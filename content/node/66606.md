    lot faster than using tabs etc.\r\nAnyway, I always have between 7 and 15 tabs
    active and there is a limit to my capabilities in working with even more tabs\u2026

    Keep feature requests and bug reports in as few threads as possible</strong> \r\n\r\nor
    preferably\r\n\r\n<strong>b) <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/contact\">Contact
    us</a> directly</strong>\r\n\r\nWe, at Punchcut, aren't often able to spend quality
    time reading all the threads on Typophile (not because we don't want to, but rather
    because our client work doesn't give us a lot of free time), therefore a lot of
    these discussions are overlooked by us unless someone from the community reaches
    out to us directly.\r\n\r\nTypophile administrators (Joe, Jared, Zara, Christian)
    can be reached by using the following e-mail address:\r\n\r\ntypophile @ punchcut

    where they go \u2013 out in the open for open discussion, not sent to some backdoor
