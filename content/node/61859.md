  body: 'There''s a lot of circumstantial evidence for this being hand-drawn: The
    two <strong>I</strong>s are different and the two <strong>S</strong>s are different.
    Also, if you put a level baseline under each individual character, the <strong>D</strong>
    slants to the right while the <strong>R</strong> and the <strong>E</strong> slant
    to the left.'
