  the typeface used to set articles in [[http://www.economist.com|The Economist]].
  On their website, they say the typeface is designed exclusively for their use.  I'm
  wondering if anyone has insight into similar typefaces which are commercially available.
  \ I just find it incredibly readable as well as pleasing to the eye. Note, I'm referring
  to the actually print magazine, not the website. I'd scan in a copy of an article,
  but I don't have a  scanner.\r\n\r\n"
