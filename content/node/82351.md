  are looking for a near exact match. It seems to be Helvetica but there are little
  differences in weight and widths of certain characters. I thought i had nearly every
  version of Helvetica. but none seem to match. Am I just wrong on the Helvetica id?\r\nThanks
  again I appreciate the knowledge base here at typophile."

  body: I was thinking that it was distorted a bit. But they have been very particular
    about not stretching or squishing.  Sign riders is the one time where I really
    ever do this. Its nice to know the previous sign maker probably was also.
