  XVth and ended in the XXth century.\r\nBut he omitted one century: the XVIIth.\r\nHow
  would you define it and call it by following Vox's word methodology?\r\n\r\n\xB6
  Thanks for your attempts."

  body: I would not follow Vox word methodology. Typeface classification should primarily
    be based on form, not on history.

    So how would you define the XVIIth century based on form?"

    can of course be more precise to refer to them but I don\u2019t see that much

  body: "The leaning of the roman by Jannon and van Dijck feature more contrast and
    the start of a vertical axis.\r\nIt's proto-transitional because of the religious
    bias of both designers.\r\nThe Dutch style influenced the roman of Caslon in the
    next decade.\r\nSanders call that era the Dutch Old Style but I think it's much
    more than a simple Dutch update.\r\nHe also omits Jannon.\r\n\"From Sedan to Amsterdam
    comes the Jandijck!\""
