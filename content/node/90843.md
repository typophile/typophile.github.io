body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI have dozens of micro-typography books but I always seem to
  \r\nrun into problems that are not mentioned in any of them, \r\nanyway that's what
  typophile.com is for I guess. \r\n\r\nI'm typesetting a book that has a lot of notes,
  a few of these\r\nnotes come up in text that is smaller(9pt) than the main text(11pt)
  \r\nbecause they are in the middle of a poem or quoted article. I am not using\r\nsuperior
  figures because the typeface (Sabon) only has 1,2 and 3 what i am\r\ndoing instead
  is using linear figures between brackets [x].\r\n\r\nok my question is: when a note
  comes up in the 9pt text, should i have \r\nthe [x] the same size as the main text
  or the size of the text it is \r\nused with...basically should the [x] always be
  11pt or should it change\r\nwhen used with 9pt text?\r\n\r\nthank you"

  body: "Andreas, I think you've answered a slightly different question from the one
    RadioB was actually asking. \r\n\r\nRadioB: in the style you've described, I'd
    say <em>don't</em> have a fixed size for the note cues, but match them to the
    surrounding text style. Keeping them at 11pt in a run of 9pt text would make them
    stand out too much. But, are you wedded to the [x] style? Do you feel that regular
    numerals with superscript formatting applied to them would be too weak/thin? If
    so, and you've got a bolder weight available, see what bold superscript numerals
    look like."

  body: "yes Andreas misunderstood what I meant although after rereading what I wrote
    I can't blame him, but thanks for taking the time to reply.\r\n\r\ndtw: I'm not
    insisting on using the [x] style, I did try the regular numerals with superscript
    and yes they did appear too thin, I didn't try using bold though so I'll give
    that a go. Thanks."

  body: "For the past 30 years, we've always followed the policy that there is one
    size for note calls, whether they occur in a chapter title, text, or extract.
    I *think* that is Chicago; it may go back to either Oxford or Cambridge style
    though. It is not universal, just one style.\r\n\r\n(This also points out the
    stupidity of having a *numbered* footnote with a chapter title.)\r\n\r\nThe other
    thing we have done since PostScript arrived is, EULA permitting, made up true-cut
    superior figures specifically for note calls. As you say, text-size figures scaled
    down are too thin. They also won't kern right, as when following a quotedblright,
    period, comma, etc. etc. The bold will be too heavy; you might just get away with
    a semi-bold.\r\n\r\nIf you can't find the right weight in Sabon, try one of the
    other Garamonds in a semi-bold, or even a Garamond with true-cut superiors. You
    can do a lot of fiddling with character styles in InDesign. Get it right once;
    you're done for the book, except for the kerning. Grep can help you there."

  body: "Thanks Charles, Semi-bold Garamond is the best of the three, my perfectionist
    side is telling me not to mix typefaces but I must admit it is better than the
    [x] style, which does seem to stick out a little bit too much, the annoying thing
    is I have books designed by Jost Hochuli and he uses the [x] style, who am I to
    disagree?\r\n\r\nI did notice that I also have a book that is typeset in Sabon
    and does have the whole superior figures, 1-9! unless the designer also used semi-bold
    and has spent a lot of time making it look perfect.\r\n\r\n"

    you could use faux superiors, and beef them up with a smidgeon of stroking."

  body: "Even better than Nick's idea, don't use Sabon at all. It was made for a reason
    back in the days of hot metal. That reason no longer exists. It happened to work
    very well with the Linotype photocomp machines, but was never dialed in with any
    of the PostScript versions. Then Linotype came along & made a \"next\" version,
    which isn't Sabon -- just another Garamond.\r\n\r\nIf you're using InDesign, IIRC,
    you got Garamond Premier (Pro) for free with one of the versions. As far as Garamonds
    go (and Sabon is one), it's one of the best. It is also published by Adobe, so
    the EULA lets you go into the font and tailor it to you needs, if you have the
    skill. Use the regular if you're going to print on uncoated stock, consider the
    medium if printing on a coated sock.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Nick makes a Garamond;
    anyway, my point is these days, there is not much in a name when it comes to revivals.
    Very few of them were handled with aplomb; they were just rushed out to boost
    sales. (O.K., I'm a curmudgeon).\r\n\r\nBut if you're stuck, why use Garamond
    semi-bold numbers scaled down? Use the superiors from, say, Garamond Premier or
    one of the other fonts."

    while skirting the old technical limitations.</cite>\r\n\r\nhrant, is your tongue
    firmly in your cheek? \r\n\r\n[Aside: RadioB, the whole point of Sabon was to
    create a family that overcame technical restrictions of hot metal, particularly
    Linotype with its duplexed mats. The commission to Tschichold was to make a font
    family where text printed from Monotype, Linotype, and foundry fonts all looked
    the same. It didn't, of course, in part due to how hard it is to even out the
    printing impression with type from a linecaster.\r\n\r\nIn spite of that goal,
    the Stempel, at least in larger sizes, had the italic on a different body than
    the roman.  I used that design as a basis for our PostScript fonts when Sabon
    first came out -- Adobe publishing, of course, to allow modification. I do believe
    that the PostScript Linotype release got even gappier in the italic, as if someone
    used the narrower characters on the old roman setwidth. And the lower-case roman
    \"c\" was screwed up, as well.] \r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAs a *compositor,* I can't
    abide any of JFP's fonts -- modifications never permitted. You can get the old
    Sabon published by Adobe; modifications permitted. There was also a PostScript
    Sabon published by somebody based on the old Monotype photocomp artwork, which
    had different f-ligatures -- but in the end it was no better than the (older)
    Linotype Sabon.\r\n\r\nGaramond has been much abused in both photocomp and PostScript,
    & I finally decided for us, anyway, that Adobe Garamond was a decent modern reinterpretation,
    and Garamond Premier the most faithful to older metal, when printed offset. YMMV.
    All these are from the \"Garamond\" Garamonds, not the \"Jannon\" Garamonds. But
    that's another story..."
