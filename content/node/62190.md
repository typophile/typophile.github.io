    Mac clones</a> and saving a bundle by not buying Apple\u2019s overpriced, overdesigned
    hardware. I will give Apple some credit\u2014the iMacs are pretty solid and generally
    much more reliable than the Apple pro laptops, but they aren\u2019t worth what
    they cost unless you really care about the aesthetics. "

    can handle pretty much anything.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend the Psystars at all.
    They're currently in the middle of lawsuit with Apple, and I believe they recently
    filed chapter 11. Aside from the fact that the company might not be around for
    long, there's no guarantee that a future software update from Apple couldn't render
    the machine useless.  (plus, as a designer, I'd hope you really care about aesthetics.)"

  body: I second the iMac recommendation. Mine has been great. I hope I never have
    to have a tower setup again.

    Season. When choosing your iMac make sure that the display is capable of 24-bits
    colour; earlier models sometimes had 18-bits colour (eg the last 21-inch model),
    which just doesn't cut the mustard for serious colourwork.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert

  body: '"No crazy needs?" but what do you plan to do with it? Surf the web, edit
    some docs? In that case the iMac seems over-kill. I would recommend a base-level
    Windows 7 machine when they come out next month, or a Linux box. Use the money
    you save on an iPhone or Zune HD. '

    an iMac now, know that there are some problems with the new 27\" model. I just
    had my 2-day-old machine exchanged (a failing graphics adapter, and more), and
    the new one just went black and doesn't boot anymore. :-(\r\nI'm not saying don't
    buy an iMac, but do read up on experiences before you buy, unlike me. Google finds
    many things. Bah."

    bit color), for an unprecedented low price, Apple-wise.\r\n\r\n(Wasn't there a
    Scrubs episode where that old chief doctor fondly caressed his \"lovely new computer\",
    while the rest had to do with PCs? I think I know how he felt.)"
