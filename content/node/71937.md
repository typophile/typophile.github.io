body: When I am developing new fonts in FontLab I tend to start with a very simple
  encoding file to keep my workspace uncluttered. Unfortunately if I have the Font
  window open in Names mode it takes on around 100 empty glyphs that just take up
  a lot of space. Is there a configuration option that will get rid of all these empty
  glyphs?

  body: "James, \r\n\r\nbut the modes are there exactly because they serve different
    needs. \r\n\r\nThe Index mode only shows the glyphs that are in your font, nothing
    else. The Codepage, Unicode Ranges and Names modes show you \"glyph repertoire
    templates\", i.e. show you the glyphs you have drawn and those that you still
    should draw. \r\n\r\nThe Names mode is by far the most popular because it allows
    unencoded glyphs (OpenType alternates). As Johnych points out, you can create
    custom .enc files that work in Names mode, with just the glyph repertoire you
    want to have. "

  body: On a similar subject, is there a way to have FontLab remember the mode and
    cell-caption settings I was using last time I worked on a font? I find myself
    having to reset them to my preferences every time I reopen a font. (They don't
    seem to be saved with the Workspace.)

  body: Create your own .enc file using the naming convention and glyph order of your
    choice. The easiest way is using a spreadsheet. Save an encoding from one of your
    font designs which you choose as a model encoding. In a text editor, search and
    replace spaces for tabs and line endings for hard returns. Copy and paste this
    into Excel or some other spreadsheet. You can add, delete or rearrange glyphs
    in the order you desire. Then replace the numerical order entries to correct sequential
    order (I just use a formula "cell above plus 1" and copy down to the end of your
    list.) Copy this text back to a text editor and search and replace tabs for spaces
    and hard returns for line endings. Save as text with .enc extension and drop in
    your Encodings folder in your Library under FontLab.

    window seems to work exactly the same, no matter which Font window mode is active,
    except for the order the glyphs go when you cycle through them using the keyboard
    shortcuts."

    mode to \u201CAll Glyphs\u201D. I guess I left it in \u201Cglyphs in encoding\u201D
    at some point, which is what caused the table to empty out when I went into Index
    mode. Although that behavior still seems kind of pointless."

  body: The "glyphs in encoding" mode would make sense if you want to avoid inadvertently
    making kerning pairs between, say, Latin and Cyrillic, which aren't likely to
    come up.

  body: 'It''s quite likely that an .enc cannot effectively have less than 256 slots.
    This has to do with the history of how encoding was originally implemented in
    FontLab (in version 3). I think it''s a legacy limitation and I''ll check if it
    can be removed in future versions of FLS. '

  body: In the meantime you could boost the size of the boxes so that those empty
    ones mostly scroll off the bottom of the screen. (Could be a pain if generated
    glyphs get put at the bottom, I suppose.)

  body: FontForge has a "compact" mode, where only non-empty slots are shown. May
    be FontLab has/can implement similar functionality. I find it very handy when
    working with fonts in which glyphs are occupying far away blocks.
