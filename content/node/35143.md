body: "I've gotten enough positive feedback that I've decided to plug forward with
  my Cecco font. However, one thing that's clear is that it looks too \"small\" for
  its point size, because the extenders are so long. In fact, I based the height metrics
  on metal Centaur, which is a very arty font as such things go, quite a bit more
  so than the foundry version, in fact.\r\n\r\nIn the Star Trek future, I'll make
  fonts with variable extender length. Coming back down to earth, I need to pick some
  now so that I can hammer out usable glyphs today. To help me understand the decision
  better, I made this chart:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/extenders_5075.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  axes are descender length (measured baseline to lowest 'p' peak) and ascender length
  (measured highest 'x' peak to highest 'l' peak), in standard Type1 units of 1000/em.\r\n\r\nOf
  the ones on this list, I'm sorta inclined to copy Gentium. It gets away with its
  tall ascender because it makes the caps quite a bit shorter (X-height:l-height of
  615:757), thus leaving adequate room for umlauts and other accents on the caps.
  Does this seem like a reasonable compromise, or do the caps seem wimpy and insubstantial?
  Certainly that's a completely different approach than the Scotch Roman tradition,
  in which caps are big, beefy, and strong.\r\n\r\nJust so I'm clear, imagine I'm
  designing this for technical papers, books, and so on, in which economy of fit is
  important (i.e. not art books).\r\n\r\nIs there a definitive reference on the subject,
  or, failing that, a Typophile thread? I know one recent project to tackle this systematically
  was the Vista ClearType font collection, but they were designing for 100dpi displays.
  I'm targeting print and high resolution displays. I've also reviewed Ch. 6 of \"Letters
  of Credit,\" but feel it was prescriptive enough, and besides, I don't think he's
  giving enough consideration to accents and non-Latin scripts.\r\n\r\nYour advice,
  as always, is welcome!"

  body: "Raph, I don't think your brief is specific enough for anyone to give a good
    answer, beyond what Tracy says. \r\n\r\nI think you if you define what purpose
    specifically it is for, and why existing faces don't fulfill the purpose well
    enough, then you can start to get a handle on a lot of things, including x-height.
    It can be a practical problem--such as low screen resolution--or an aesthetic
    problem, or both. But in any case I think defining the specifics of the problem
    you are trying to solve comes first. "

    often set leaded solid (I'm thinking of the Morison/Monotype practice). \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/First_4216.jpg]\r\n\r\nToday,
    with Quark and MS Word with their default or built-in extra leading, and the general
    sloppiness of typography, copious leading has become the norm -- and that aesthetic
    tends to weaken the presence of liberally-extendered faces. If you're going to
    produce a fogey face, don't pull your punches. Forget theory and accomodating
    today's practice, and produce a thoroughly prescriptive specimen which shows people
    exactly how they should use the damn thing tomorrow."

  body: "The need to support languages that use diacritics extensively was behind
    Victor Gaultney's decision to increase ascender length and to decrease the cap
    size in Gentium from what is considered typical. Especially with stacked diacritics
    as in Vietnamese, the long ascenders provide enough room above the x-height for
    the lowercase while the smaller caps allow space for their own diacritics as well.
    In addition, for languages such as German that use capital letters frequently
    may be helped by making the caps a bit smaller and therefore less obtrusive.\r\n\r\nI
    like Gentium, but it probably represents the case of going as far as you can with
    that approach with regards to what's acceptable. For most uses, I'm guessing decreasing
    the ascenders of Gentium a hair while keeping the cap size would yield usable
    proportions. What sort of uses do you have in mind for Cecco, and what size range
    are you targeting?"

  body: "William: yes, I agree that my description is too vague.\r\n\r\nI am working,
    in my extremely spare time, on a mathematical publishing system called Ghilbert.
    This is a very long term, somewhat speculative project, with a high risk of never
    paying off. Even so, it is immensely rewarding to work on, and I'm hoping that
    even if it never achieves the main goal, the spinoffs will be useful.\r\n\r\nOne
    such spinoff is the default font for text. Essentially, this font will fulfill
    the same role for Ghilbert as does Computer Modern for TeX. It should be a usable,
    readable, friendly font, versatile enough that it would rarely be a <em>bad</em>
    choice for such documents. Further, it should be suitable for immersive text reading,
    as in books. Essentially, I want a font good enough that a non-typographer user
    has a better chance of sticking with the default rather than choosing another
    readily available font.\r\n\r\nThe Cecco sample paul posted is essentially an
    exercise in reinterpreting the Jenson Eusebius with my own eyes. Basically, what
    I want to do now is roll the clock forward - smooth over a few of the quirks of
    that seminal work, such as the diagonal e (still present as an alternate, though).
    At the same time, I want to subtly reword the metrics of the font to make it more
    practical, in much the same way that Bible Centaur did for Centaur.\r\n\r\nI want
    the font to be beautiful without calling attention to itself. Imagine, say, that
    you have before you a flagon of wine. There is a school of thought that maintains
    that Bembo is the highest accomplishment in all fonts designed for books, and
    that all deviations from that near-Platonic ideal are degradations. Cecco Text
    will, I hope, not be a disappointment to such folk, and will also exist in digital
    form with good spacing and more than two instances of optical sizes. At the same
    time, it will be far from a mechanical clone, and in particular will retain enough
    flavor of the original Jenson that he might be able to recognize it if he were
    alive today.\r\n\r\nI also have a few requirements specific to the 21st Century:
    it must handle accents without compromise, and, eventually, I hope to have at
    least Greek and Cyrillic complements as well. Further, this font must either harmonize
    with or be used as the basis for math typesetting.\r\n\r\nNick: thanks for the
    encouragement. Yes, it is valid to assume that I have full control over all typesetting
    parameters, definitely including things such as leading. In the most ambitious
    plan, my layout algorithms will automatically be able to select width alternates
    to improve fit, just as Mardersteig and Blumenthal did in the first half of the
    last century.\r\n\r\nHope that fills in some more context. Apologies if my ambitions
    sound too grand - but then, if I only accomplish a tenth of what I set out to
    do, it will still be useful and enjoyable."

    length, and small-cap height, which will compromise Greek and Cyrillic later.\r\n\r\nHowever,

  body: "Raph, you've put a lot of demands on yourself. The math setting is evidently
    a key one for you. My guess is that you will have to feel your way, perhaps doing
    the math characters first, then doing trial and error to find the proportions
    you like best. And optical size is important, as I'm sure you know.\r\n\r\nHere
    are two ideas you might want to chew on. First, I wonder if you are not multiplying
    conflicting demands on yourself, so that the project becomes an impossibility.
    How important is it to you to be able to set mathematics text books in Vietnamese
    *and* beautifully set a novel? From the point of view of being able to get it
    done, it is maybe a better tactic to decide on a core purpose, and if you can
    accomplish that to your own satisfaction, then look to expanding later. \r\n\r\nSecond,
    there are a lot of recent interpretations of Jenson worth having a look at to
    see what you like and want to avoid. I don't know how many you've studied, but
    there are quite a few recent interpretations such as Jim Parkinson's Parkinson,
    John Downer's Iowa Old Style, Nick Shinn's Goodchild, Christian Schwartz's Houston,
    Randy Jones's Eason and so on. And of course there is Adobe Jenson, which sets
    a pretty daunting standard as a revival. "

  body: "William: I was familiar with most of those. Thanks for rounding out my knowledge
    - the less classical, or as Nick would say, \"fogey\" interpretations are also
    interesting.\r\n\r\nI've been looking into this more deeply, and now have more
    insight into why I've been struggling with this. The first issue is the age-old
    one of \"how long should the descenders be\", and the second is how to keep the
    type from looking really small compared to other fonts of the same nominal size,
    all without clipping.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable descender length goes up and down
    almost as regularly as dress hemlines. Ridiculously short in Gutenberg. Nice and
    long in Jenson and Aldus. Short in Guillen de Brocar's 1517 Polyglot Bible. Consistently
    pretty long in the French work (but see Tory's Champfleury) and short in the German.
    Very long in the Monotype heyday of the '20s and '30s. Shrinking to almost nothing
    by the '70s ITC days. Not quite that bad, but shorter than the metal, when we
    get to the digital version of just plain Bembo, but lengthened again in the more
    faithful Book.\r\n\r\nThis question clearly hasn't been resolved any time in the
    last 500 years, and might not in the remainder of the millennium. What's a good
    postmodernist to do? Variation, of course! And yes, Nick, I am writing (and using)
    software \"like Superpolator\".\r\n\r\nBut I think I'm also running into a purely
    technical problem. The entire issue of what I call \"height metrics\" is messy
    and complicated (to me, \"vertical metrics\" means metrics for vertical writing
    modes, as is common in CJK). There's a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/13081?\">How-To</a>
    here with input from paul hunt and John Hudson, but I must say reading it left
    me almost as confused as before. Certainly, whenever I've created a font, I've
    felt the need to stay within the 1000 unit prison, lest I get clipping when using
    it in various applications.\r\n\r\nI think, but am not 100% sure yet, that there
    is a safe way to get past 1000 units without clipping. I think the reason I haven't
    figured that out before is that the rules changed between the Type1 and the OpenType
    days. I have yet to discover a clear explanation of these rules, but <a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc1ee0e\">Adobe's
    releases</a> certainly show a discrepancy.\r\n\r\nAs for my own default descender
    lengths, I'm just going to go with my eye. I did a test set with too-short descenders,
    which turned out not too bad, but I want them longer to do book-like settings.
    This will be a useful model for the smaller optical sizes, though, which obviously
    need short descenders.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cecco_size_4567.png]"

    These, Peter  Peter Bi\u013Eak explains, are intended for different optical sizes.
    \r\n\r\nI find the look of Fedra Serif quite innovative and interesting, though
    I like longer extenders in books. My feeling is that what is best will vary with
    the destination; shorter columns, more tightly packed, will work with shorter
    extenders...\r\n\r\nSlimbach's Optical sizes for Adobe also all have variations
    in extenders for optical size. \r\n\r\nOn the issue of clipping, you probably
    already know this, but you don't have to have the actual extenders sum to the
    1000 em. There is usually additional space, partly to accomodate upper case diacritics--which
    are recommended to extend no more than 1200 from the descender, to avoid clipping.
    \r\n\r\nYou didn't ask, but your 'b', above, screams out at me as too wide in
