  in Illustrator piece by piece merging each objects and pasting it inside fontlab
  prior to tweaking. This is my first try to draw every glyphs in fontlab so please
  bear with me =)\r\n\r\nI'll name it Basa Nova for the meantime until I can think
  of something better. Basa means \"read\" in my native language and because it was
  intended to be a text face which readability is important, I decided to name it
  this way.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if some of the letterforms do make sense at all but
  I kinda like it subtlety when it is set into a running texts, though I might be
  wrong too.\r\n\r\nOnly lowercase letters for now and currently designing the uppercase
  as of this writing. Do you think it is worth pushing for?\r\n"
