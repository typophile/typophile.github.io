  bit more. I'm confident with the process for Alignment Zones and using the Adobe
  Auto Hinter, then making manual adjustments throughout for great results, but the
  Auto stem feature is a bit more elusive, although from visual results related to
  the finished hinting results it seems to work well so far.\r\n\r\nI noticed if you
  open Myriad Pro you'll see a couple values, but if you hit the Auto stem button
  it adds more AND different values, so I'm trying to understand how best to handle
  standard stems moving forward, being that it looks as if there is a better way to
  handle this manually (as in the case of Myriad, for example).\r\n\r\nIt seems pretty
  simple in that your defining the width of vertical and horizontal stems, but depending
  on the typeface these can vary greatly, although it seems that we should be looking
  for the most prominent stems to define, correct? \r\n\r\nI haven't yet experimented
  much as far as testing varying values and the on-screen results, but is the difference
  in values set clearly noticeable on screen? What should I be looking for and what
  is the best way to handle this process for the best results?\r\n\r\nWhat about Italic
  vertical stem values, as the auto feature really seems to exaggerate them way too
  much.\r\n\r\nIs it best to delete all the extra values that Auto stems creates and
  narrow it down to no more than a few of the most prominent vertical and horizontal
  stem values?\r\n\r\nPlease advise. Thanks."
