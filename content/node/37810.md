  there have any experience with creating fonts for this language? What would the
  best encoding be for this format? I know that many of the characters must be able
  to stack on top of each other in order to make sounds, would it be best to make
  all of these combined characters into ligatures and create an extensive liga set
  in opentype? This project is just beginning and I think I'll have a lot of time
  to both draw characters as well as figure out the technicalities. I'll probably
  have a million more questions as I start to get into this, so any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nOK\r\nRC"

    is on the road in Asia at the moment. You could also contact Chris Fynn, who has
    spent time developing Tibetan fonts in Bhutan. http://www.btinternet.com/~c.fynn/index.html
