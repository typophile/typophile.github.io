  body: I'd love to be there, Nick, but the 3 hour drive (each way) is daunting. Does
    this mean the Type Club is getting active again? (I note the events on the web
    page are terribly dated). I'd be more willing to get down there for events in
    the other three seasons.

    I'm sure we can find someone to put you up for the night."

  body: I can happily report that the Type Club is also a partner in presenting TypeCon2008.
    We'll incorporate tasty Canadian regional flavor in the program to go along with
    the Arts and Crafts, Germanic, and punk stylings of greater Buffalo/Niagara.

    slow me, in fact may be jammed.\r\n\r\nAt the border they ask me, do what do I
    declare?\r\nbut I say nothing, there's nothing back there.\r\n\r\nBut I come bearing
    gifts to Typeclub folks,\r\nP22 swag: fonts, books and a few jokes.\r\n\r\nSo
    come one, come all, that\u2019s what I say,\r\nAnd Martyn Anstice can buy me a
    drink, eh?"

    the party. I certainly had a great time. Nick, you get the award for best outfit
    of the evening, Rich for best touque, Stan and Brian for best beards, Haley and
    Eric for best glasses, and me for best crutches (was at hospital today, aluminum
    be damned come next Monday!). \r\n\r\nHaley, you're just too shy. Tell people
    about your big win. I just know you want to scream it off the top of a mountain.
    Don't hold back!\r\n\r\nBest wishes to everyone for the holidays."

    that I know how to spell touque, I may wear them more often.
