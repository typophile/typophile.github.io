  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Three of my favorite movements of art history are the Bauhaus movement, the Constructivist movement, and the Futurism movement.  Clearly, Bauhaus, Futurism and Constructivism are related insomuch as Constructivism was the Russian lovechild of Bauhaus and Futurism.  And so it goes:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauhaus_5755.jpg]
Bauhaus is the big granddaddy of 20th century design.  Strong geometric shapes and lines characterize this style.  Streamline was key not only in Bauhaus architecture, but as is apparent from the picture, in design.  Sans serif fonts became more prevelant thanks to Bauhaus, and the modern age was born.  Oh, the celebration of man!

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1038935991futurism_5897.jpg]
Futurism began in Italy in the early 1900s and lasted until the end of WWI.  Futurists took the Bauhaus' teachings and made them political.  Relating natural and man-made forms to the laudability of war and fascism, Futurism was used as a rallying mechanism for the Italian people.

Ironically enough, the Bauhaus also came to inspire Constructivism, which typified Communism.  Isn't it great how one school of thought can appease an entire spectrum of political belief?  The strong primary colors, abstraction, and gemometric shapes in Constructivism were used as tools rather than pretty aesthetics.  How can such things be tools, you ask?  The designs were strong to represent the strength of the Russian government and workforce to reassure the people of the validity of Communism.</div>
