  body: Gosh that brings back a memory! Around 1930 My mother took art lessons by
    correspondence from the ABC Art school in France. I think she learned from diagrams
    like this how one can draw different expressions. Later on she drew them for us
    when we were kids.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/three faces_6643.GIF]
