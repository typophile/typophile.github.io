  conscious of my consumption and waste.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BottleBeutyShotCropped_6226.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  drink a lot of water, travel a lot and spend a lot of time in New Orleans where
  the water is of dubious potability.  We have excellent well water at home so all
  I needed was something in which to carry it. I researched plastics of all kind and
  got real scared by most of them.  I found a perfect and beautiful stainless steel
  canteen bought by the U.S. Army but it retails to civilians for $90.00.  Plus, the
  washer on the plug was made from one of those plastics I didn't like.  \r\n\r\nI
  noticed a glass, wine-size beer bottle with a re-usable stopper in our cupboard,
  someone had give us a holiday gift of fragrant viniger in it the year before.  So,
  I started to haul it around.  But the exposed glass frightened me and I wanted it
  protect.\r\n\r\nWe recycle those those nasty little shopping bags and had collected
  many.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Re-purpose_Bottle001B_4065.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  dawned on me that I could make an insulating bottle container of my own:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b002_4419.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b003_6190.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b005_4074.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b006_4255.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b007_5753.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b010_4994.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b011_4655.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b013_5031.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b014_5679.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/re-purposed_bottle_b015_4208.jpg]\r\n\r\nAll
  you need is the bags, a pair of scissors, a large crochet hook ($0.95) and time."

  body: "dear htking,\r\n\r\nthank you for the glass water bottle link, i couldn't
    find anything like this when i looked a year ago, maybe these products, of the
    site, are new?\r\n\r\nhi guerilla,\r\n\r\ni made this chunky on purpose so it
    would insulate the bottle from breaking.  someone had already mentioned that my
    idea was not original, probably my over active imagination and photographic memory
    picked-up something like this and just tucked it away.\r\n\r\ni work with such
    extreme refinement in my professional life that it is a pleasure to make something
    as crude as this bottle cover.  besides, you can more easily see some of the original
    graphics when the pieces are big."

    can see the exacting form of work I usually do.  Proofing engraving with a ten-power
    loop all day makes me appreciate varying degrees of refinement in other works
    I do.\r\n\r\nwww.nancysharoncollinsstationer.com\r\n\r\nAlso\u2014on this sustainability
    line of thought\u2014we're working on a new entry level engraved monogram and
    note card line.  The packaging for it pictured below\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Collegiate_Packaging_4_6246.B.jpg]\r\n\r\nis
    made from cover stock that was donated to AIGA New Orleans (NOLA) after the storms
    of 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  This cover stock was amongst the supplies
    that came down in the MBulance, which was just part of the design aid relief efforts
    nation-wide.  In addition to computers, software, books/magazines and much needed
    art supplies, we received 4 cartons of Fibermark \"Jersey Plate\" in navy, each
    carton weighs 160 pounds.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28614\r\n\r\nOne
    carton went to AIGA NOLA and was used for program covers for the first big fund
    raiser here after the storms.  One carton was donated to Loyola University New
    Orleans and part of it was made into hand silk screened posters for the first
    annual New Orleans Green Salon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2008GreenSalon_Poster_5685.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://sustainability.aiga.org/discussion/2008/03/bright_mississi.cfm\r\n\r\nThis
    is now an annual event where we partner with the city, Tulane/LSU AgCenter/UNO
    and about a dozen non-profits here interested in re-building New Orleans with
    sustainable practices.\r\n\r\nhttp://sustainability.aiga.org/discussion/2009/02/new_orleans_gre.cfm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aiganeworleans.org/events/green-salon\r\n\r\nThis
    year's event was webcast LIVE and was the first such event presented \"virtually\"
    and in real time.  AIGA New Orleans is a pretty small chapter but we get a lot
    done.  There are between 40 and 60 professional members, only, and between 200
    and 300 student members.  Which is why we are so supportive of our student typographic
    and design communities."
