  <BR> <BR>This is my first type design, though this is probably the fifth version.
  It is necessary to precise that I haven&#39;t start the spacing job, I don&#39;t
  really know what to start with. I understand that a good spacing job will make the
  kerning job easier &#40;a little&#41;, then how to do a good spacing. If the regular
  goes well, I planned to do the italics, small caps and at least three weights. Every
  feedback will be welcome. <BR> <BR>Thanks from Montreal <BR>Rapha'

  body: 'nice job, raphael!  <BR> <BR>my comments:  <BR>- the &#34;a&#34; looks too
    narrow;  <BR>- the &#34;straight vertical&#34; strokes on rounded <BR>characters
    &#40;bdpqo&#41; seems a little disturbing;  <BR>- the uppercase and numbers are
    ok;  <BR>- the section is great.  <BR> <BR>can we see a text sample? &#40;even
    without the  <BR>proper spacing, i think it is very helpful for  <BR>critique&#41;'

  body: Raphael <BR> <BR>it really very nice <BR> <BR>I agree with eduardo that the
    vertical strokes on the rounded charactes are disturbing, maybe you can make them
    shorter in order to extend the curve. <BR> <BR>in the numerals 6 abd 9 I think
    that the eyes close to abrupt, maybe you can give them a more curvy way to close
    <BR> <BR>in your @ I think the a is too big and too square. <BR> <BR>the lc 2
    is too heavy in the upper curve <BR> <BR>in the UC 7 i think the diagonal is a
    little bit to the left. <BR> <BR>anyway, these is a great font, i am anxious to
    see it working on a long text <BR> <BR>CG

  body: This is pretty nice. Only the UC &#34;F&#34; seems off. And I would shorten
    the descenders a bit. <BR> <BR>I like the numerals, and the &#34;peculiars&#34;
    too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: looks great, and has good mentality. <BR>i pro the straight vertical, they
    give the font some of his original touch. but you might want to soften the joint
    of the straight verticals with with the curves to avoid the bone effect &#40;straight
    lines look like they are getting thinner in the middle&#41;.
