  that might mimic the appearance of the hand drawn typeface used for the cover of
  an old Farmer's Almanac.  Anybody know of a close fit? I like the the shading and
  roundness of the letterforms, but most examples I've found online take the decorative
  aspect too far for my liking (i.e. zebrawood).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEvan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/almanac_deetail_4665.jpg]"

    \     Cripto Font from Intellecta Design. It has shading and dropshadow plus a
    bit more but still simple looking.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
