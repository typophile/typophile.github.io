body: 'I received my new HP laptop this weekend which features a widescreen and a
  full-sized keyboard &#40;incluing a numerical keypad&#41;, and I&#39;ve run into
  and interesting/annoying quirk.  It seems that the return/enter key works exactly
  like the enter key on the numerical keyboard.  On most applications this doesn&#39;t
  matter too much, but using Adobe applications I&#39;ve run into some problems.  In
  Adobe inDesign CS when I hit return I get a column break [num enter] instead of
  paragraph break.  I also get column break when I hit enter on the numerical keypad.  According
  to the menu the paragraph break should be [enter].  I do get the paragraph break
  if I hold down the FN key while hitting enter, but it would be nice if I didn&#39;t
  have to do that every time I want a paragraph break.  So my question is: is there
  a way to remap the return/enter key so that I don&#39;t have hold down the FN key
  to get a paragraph break?  I&#39;m using Win XP home, and the computer is a HP Pavialion
  zd7000.'

    It sounds like remapping &#34;Num: Enter&#34; to &#34;Special: Enter&#34; would
    solve your problem.'

  body: 'Justin, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help! I tried SharpKeys and half a dozen
    other programs after I posted and it seems like SharpKeys comes closest to what
    I&#39;m trying to do. The only drawback is that when I do remap Num: Enter to
    Special: Enter is that it changes both the keyboard enter and the keypad enter
    and not just one of them. But this is a lot better than having numerical enter
    on both of them. I guess this depends on the hardware, they probably both send
    the same code to windows, and if you change one scancode you change them both.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it!'
