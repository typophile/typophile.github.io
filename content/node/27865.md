body: "I am looking for some typefaces to jazz up Fournier for an extended publication.
  Every schoolboy knows that Fournier-le-Jeune designed dozens of typefaces in many
  sizes and weights, and that only a fortunate handful of these have been in use outside
  their first appearance. I have been using Fournier STD for some time, and it's great.
  But I need more type to spice it up a bit. I know that there were several decorative
  faces cut for his type manuals, but I can only find one that has been digitized:\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/lanston/products/fournier.html\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone knows of any other early French transitional/rationalist decorated type,
  or other historically faithful digitizations of any of the Fournier family's designs,
  that would be really helpful. I think there are some similarly decorated designs
  by Bodoni some of which might also work. I know he did some display designs and
  other oddities for his Manuale Tipografico, for example a design resembling the
  type shown here, but without the horizontal lines in the fill:\r\nhttp://www.discogs.com/viewimages?what=L&obid=52249\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    Jewel</a> fonts surely looked to these models for inspiration.
