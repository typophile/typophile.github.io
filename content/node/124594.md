  client originally found it on Dafont but I want a better/similar font... not a free
  font, something I can purchase that has been considered. Needs to have similar styling
  - any help appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kronos_4933.jpg]\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nGiles"

  body: That's looks to me like an actual rip-off of Robert Slimbach's original Cronos
    Italic MM (where MM stands for Multiple Master). He revisited the design later
    and watered down the italic somewhat for the opentype release. So you might look
    to purchasing the original.

  body: Yes Les,  it sure is a Cronos Italic rip, probably why he can't find it on
    Dafont anymore.

  body: "Sorry my bad, it is the font, Cronos MM and was supplied by another agency
    - I had assumed it was a dafont download as it had limited characters . The problem
    is the weight of the characters needed to be increased for packaging so looking
    for alternates. Nick, Sensibility is a really nice font so am putting this one
    forward as well.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    do best: compute an intermediary, easy!'
