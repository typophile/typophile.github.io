body: Is there a simple way to achieve this seemingly unattainable goal? This post
  itself is a reattempt to upload a pdf. I just hit attach file, and according to
  the site, it's checked under "list." now all I have to do is hit "submit," and in
  a normal world, this would seem to do the trick. However, if you see no attached
  file down under this post, you have also then seen the reason FOR this post.

  body: Christopher the only way to upload at PDF is to be the originator of the thread.
    When creating the thread look for "File Attachments".  You can always edit the
    thread you started and insert the PDF there. Note again that it can only be added
    to the initial thread post.
