  body: "Yes, it must be Knockout. If not... Knockout will certainly do the job. Oh
    wait... bloody hell... the price! $170 is not exactly in the budget. That would
    leave me $30. :-(\r\n\r\nI found <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=steelfish&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=SOUNDCLASH&nb_ppp=10&psize=l&classt=alpha\">Steelfish</a>
    over at DaFont, which is maybe a tad 2nd rate compared to Knockout. But the price
    is right."

  body: "Ah... Tilting Gothic... also very nice and maybe just as close, no? On the
    surface, the only major difference between Tilting and Knockout are the different
    weights available.\r\n\r\nThanks, Stephen!"
