body: "Hello everybody.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to Fontlab 5, so I can not figure out
  a good way to solve a problem I have.\r\nCurrently I am working on a multilayered
  font. It has a solid base and some line patterns (which are seperate weights) that
  should fit perfectly on top of the solid weight. Problem is that they don't, because
  I drew the whole thing in Illustrator and the copy & paste process set off the vectors
  just a teeny tiny bit.\r\n\r\nI tried the Background option, but somehow it seemed
  to be not exact enough. I'd prefer a dark grey vector in the background, exactly
  like the ones in the 'shape groups' or 'neighbours'. It should be my original, standard
  glyph, so I can match all other weights based on it. \r\n\r\nThere is an attachment
  with the font. Hope it helps with the explanation and what I actually want. :-)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBeta\r\n"

    use floating-point coordinates.\r\n\r\nSolution: refine it by hand in FontLab."
