  body: Thanks but both Pricedown and Pincoya are quite different from the one in
    the attatchment. I think the closest I found was Jazz Gothic Alternate but I think
    they aren't the same.

  body: Sorry Zerphin, but what's wrong with Pricedown? That looks to match perfectly
    to me, only of course when using alternate /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/pricedown/black/glyphs.html#glyphs/555618/387|M]].
