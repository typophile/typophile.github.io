body: "I'm redesigning my resume, and I've settled on Galaxie Polaris as the main
  body text font. I'm feeling, however, that without a paired serif font, the resume
  comes off as a bit static or conservative, especially so considering I'm involved
  in interactive design and animation. \r\n\r\nI know there's Galaxie Copernicus,
  but I think a slab serif would add a more bold and playful contrast to the Polaris.
  Lookin around, but not sure if anyone has opinions on this. I've attached what I
  have so far, so any suggestions in general are great!"

  body: "Well, serif fonts are generally the conservative ones!\r\n\r\nI think your
    resume looks nice - but it depends a lot who's going to be looking at it. If it
    falls into the lap of somebody who is both typographically aware and heavily involved
    in multimedia production (so presumably \"expressive\") then you <em>might</em>
    get a negative reaction.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add some flair I might do it in
    the body face itself, and use a darker weight of the same face as the secondary
    font. If you want to do it in the secondary, maybe this:\r\nhttp://new.typographica.org/2009/typeface-reviews/fp-head-pro/\r\n\r\nWhat
    might be ideal is finding a secondary\r\nfont that's reminiscent of your \"Ea\"
    logo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    concerned if maybe my choice of secondary color is too typical? Too safe?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Resume_09_5265.jpg]"

    bit more expressive. Look at Klim's National for example.\r\n\r\nColor: I tend
    to avoid color :-) but I do suggest that you should first choose your house colors,
    and then stick to them (on your site too).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "hrant:\r\n\r\nYes, I'm really liking National. I'll give it a shot. Im also
    in the process of redesigning my site, so Im kinda trying to work on the site
    and resume/marketing materials in tandem. The original logo, and the heading type
    in the website are both Poplar Std, but I've quite grown tired of its tone. National
    might just be perfect for me. "

  body: "Agree with what Hrant said. I would have suggested National too! \r\nAnd
    yes, I think blue is <em>extremely</em> typical for technology stuff\u2026 and
    this is also a rather unexciting shade of blue (which also seems to differ between
    the logo and the headings BTW, but maybe that's just the compression). You might
    want to play around with that a little more.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n\"e\"/\"a\" mirrored:
    Might be cool \u2013 just don't make it too \"69\"-ish (SCNR):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_beate-uhse_start_6538.gif]"

  body: "I'm actually an Aquarius, which originally had me leaning towards Museo for
    a typeface. Structured and contained, but with the nice flow to the serifs. Actually,
    National kind of reminds me of Museo (without sacrificing as many of those elements
    as with Museo Sans).\r\n\r\nI really like that mirrored idea. Purposeful and simple,
    but it's playful and suggests broad perspective. \r\n\r\nI'll come up with some
    ideas."

  body: Why not bring in some elements from your drawings/illustrations (which are
    fandabidozi) into your cv? Maybe just the looseness and free-flowing handmade
    quality?
