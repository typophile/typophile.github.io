  in the world of type design. Let's pool what we know. Paid or unpaid, what opportunities
  do you see out there? Who typically accepts interns? Who amongst you have apprenticed
  to learn the craft?\r\n\r\nIf you're an independent type designer, or run a small
  foundry, what would be your criteria for selecting an incoming intern or apprentice?\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    offering an unpaid internship is illegal.\r\n\r\nI have however been on a couple
    of minimum wage paying internships which proved very good as learning experiences.\r\nI
    would happily intern at any design studio whose work i admired - my ability to
    learn from those better than me is the only criteria i feel is important.\r\n\r\nWill"

    sit in front of a blank wall and contemplate the universe for 5 days. If they
    manage to attain to inner peace and harmony, I'd let them go. (Obviously not cut
    out for type design.) \r\n\r\nIf they can sit and grumble for 5 days while staring
    at a blank wall, perhaps punching it now and then, then they are qualified to
    learn Fontlab and to continue their lessons.\r\n\r\n&lt;/sarcasm&gt;\r\n"

    Most internships last less than three months. But people often need much more
    than three months to figure out Fontlab (or type design software in general)."

  body: "I'm currently interning part-time and have spoken to several (small) design
    and publishing companies here in Brighton who rely quite heavily on interns. From
    the company's side, they really just want somebody who's clued up enough to be
    a real help, so they'll review applicants' CVs carefully. At interview, they'll
    make sure the person isn't weird, but also go through a portfolio to see what
    skills they can bring and develop.\r\n\r\n>in the Uk the minimum wage act means
    that offering an unpaid internship is illegal.\r\n\r\nStill, according to YouGov,
    40% of interns here are not paid or receive expenses only. I think people assume
    the minimum wage doesn't apply somehow. For me it's a personal choice. I'd certainly
    consider an expenses-only type internship if such a thing existed; it would depend
    on the job description."

  body: "Dalton Maag does take interns, and we usually require people to stay between
    two to three months. All our work experiences are unpaid. Will's assertion about
    minimum wage is correct in as far as it depends what the intern does. If the intern
    is actively involved in the company's business, then minimum wage applies. However
    if it's a 'voluntary work experience' or 'study period' where the intern does
    not productively contribute to the business the M-W does not apply.\r\n\r\nOur
    interns are not involved in our day-to-day business but work on their own projects.
    Depending on their experience they may have to start off painting letters using
    brushes and b/w gouache paint to learn to see before we let them near any digital
    equipment. Once in Fontlab they learn the basics of the program and expand their
    design to the full Latin alphabet. Throughout this process the intern benefits
    from our team's experience and access to resources (computer, printer, internet
    etc). If the intern is talented, and we do ask him/her to contribute, the work
    is paid. Simple.\r\n\r\nAnd before anyone asks, we have no spaces until January
    2013.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag"

  body: "Hi Steve, well I don't feel here is the place to be posting that sort of
    detail about companies. When I was looking, it was just a case of Googling publishing
    and design places in Brighton and sending in my CV speculatively with a link to
    my online portfolio. And networking, I went to several freelance/creative-related
    events and noted people's names to Google later.\r\n\r\nBruno, that's good to
    know. I certainly view my current internship as a learning experience rather than
    a job."
