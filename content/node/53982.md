body: "Some of you may be aware of my handwriting typeface \"Comic Jens\", which <a
  href=\"http://www.kutilek.de/download/comic-jens.zip\">can be downloaded freely</a>
  and is released under a Creative Commons licence. I tried to capture my handwriting
  by using the mouse to draw with the brush tool directly in FontLab.\r\n\r\nAfter
  visiting St Petersburg last fall, I decided to add Cyrillic support to the fonts.
  I tried to follow the same \"rules\" as I had done in the Latin alphabet, i.e. the
  lowercase forms are rather cursive, but non-connecting. That means that some of
  the Cyrillic lowercase letters changed their form drastically compared to the upright
  printing forms.\r\n\r\nIs this readable at all, or should I better stick to the
  upright forms? Are there any letters that just don't work? Any other comments?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nJens"

    care for the black blobs in the capital B, D, \u0414, or \u0436; I think your
    \u0414 and \u0431 are problematic and need work.\r\n\r\nI really hope you are
    going to complete Cyrillic support in your font, and do the rest of the characters
    in the UCS.\r\n\r\nMichael Everson\r\nevertype.com"

    - is not correct, check [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cyrillic_L.png|here]]
    for more info.\r\n\u0431 - is falling to right.\r\n\u0437 - is not correct, doesn't
    goes into descender.\r\n\u0418 - is doubtable.\r\nD - is not Cyrilic, it should
    be \u0414.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain \"problem\" is that your Cyrilic version is not neither
    Regular neither Italic version  Cyrilic alphabet, it's some mixture. Check [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cyrillic-italics-nonitalics.png|this.]]\r\n\r\nFind
    some Cyrilic font and analyze it."
