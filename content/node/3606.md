  programmer. Privately, I am, among &#40;a few&#41; other things, a lover of design
  with typography near the top of the list of favorite design disciplines. I&#39;d
  been searching for a specific book for the better part of a year, when a friend
  suggested I look for a forum discussing typography to ask experts and enthusiasts
  my question:  <BR> <BR>Is there such a book &#40;or, hopefully, books&#41; which
  look at:  <BR> <BR>- How cultural, social, economic, political trends have impacted
  the use of existing typefaces and design of new typefaces, and <BR>- Conversely,
  how uses of existing and new typefaces have, through the course of history, affected
  communication and expression, and impacted greater cultural, social, economic, political
  trends? <BR> <BR>My interest is pretty broad: a historical account, a contemporary
  analysis, theory. I&#39;d be interested in a couple of other related topics, such
  as the crosstalk between typography and other design disciplines, or at what time
  and in which contexts were specific design elements and forms in specific glyphs
  or whole typefaces introduced.  <BR> <BR>A rather broad description. Any hits in
  the vicinity would be appreciated, as is your patience to simply read this post.  <BR>
  <BR>Much thanks,  <BR>KLS'

  body: 'Here&#39;s another: <BR>The Visible Word : Experimental Typography and Modern
    Art, 1909-1923, by Johanna Drucker <BR> <BR>I was reminded of it by Armin&#39;s
    post -- like Heller, Drucker attaches great importance to the publications of
    early 20th C art movements. She also argues that the integration of text into
    &#40;some&#41; modern art which occurred at that time subsequently went missing,
    with the unfortunate result that Post WW2 modernism, especially the NY school,
    slipped into a polarized void, with critics supplying all the words, and the art
    becoming a dumb, shallow,  conceptual second fiddle.  <BR>Anyway, that&#39;s how
    I remember the book from reading it a few years ago, so she might actually have
    said something quite different.  '

  body: K.Lo -- I&#39;m not saying a book doesn&#39;t exist for your topic. But I
    will say that it sounds like you have a great idea for a potential thesis. --
    I&#39;m not sure you will find a book with your wishes directly. I might start
    by finding books with excellent bibliographies and branch out in those directions.
    I think you will find that you are going to have to form many of the connections
    on your own.  <BR> <BR>I wonder if you might find something or someone from the
    University of Reading -- <a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/" target="_blank">http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/</a>
    -- that might share your interests, Simon Eliot has done research involving economics
    and the history of printing. He might be a good lead. Dig around their site, they
    list all of the staff&#39;s research in bibliographic form.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    keep my eyes open. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>On a side note &#34;Typography Papers
    5&#34; has been released. If ever there were five publications necessary to a
    serious typophile &#40;with interests too broad to saddle&#41; it would be these.
