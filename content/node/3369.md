  body: You make it look inked in skin by drawing on a semi-transparent  substrate
    and either scan of photograph. <BR> <BR>I think that the centre centaur is brill-o!
    Your intials are there, popping in and out - stick with this one. <BR> <BR>kris.

    a tattoe of sorts. At least the &#34;texture&#34; of it.

    is a little creepy but it&#39;s still better than the tangram style.

    centaur variations and decided to stick with the monogram centaur. <BR> <BR> <BR>This
    is the centaur. It is a bit darker than the sketch was. There are two suggested
    variations of it but I think it still works better plain as it is. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28195.gif"

  body: Good work, mate. I notice that the eye looks a lot more defined when the &#34;pupil&#34;
    is coloured and the stroke is white. It looks much more serious and purposeful.
    The type isn&#39;t doing much for me at the mo, calm it down, like Hrant said.  <BR>

    definately growing on me. I finally saw the shark reference, but this did not
    put me off. <BR> <BR>As for its aggression. I am unsure what it is actually like
    in Mexico. And I am going to be basing this generalisation on my lack of experiencing
    the America&#39;s. But it seems to me that aggressive imagery is very common,
    within festivals and celebrations. So I do not see it as an issue. <BR> <BR>Great
    result. I love watching all these evolutions. '
