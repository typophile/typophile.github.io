  body: The original, predigital typeface was VGC's Ingrid (by Markus J. Low, I believe).
    Fontbank digitized it as <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/ingenius.htm"
    target="_blank">Ingenius</a>. There's an anonymous version out there called Chaucer
    that's much better spaced, but it's probably tough to find. I think that it's
    just a tweaked Ingenius.
