  classy looking theme for my blog and would like to use a font for the headings which
  carries and extends this feeling. I used Georgia rather extensively so far and would
  like to use a different type for the headings which should look a bit more stronger
  and firmer. I remembered that the $- and the \u20AC-signs have their extra-lines
  for representing just these characteristics and vaguely remembered these types which
  contain capitals with a second stem. I attached a demonstration (actually modified
  Georgia-letters) of what I mean.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether this is the right
  forum (Pardon me, if it's wrong...); but I would like to know if there is a particular
  term for this characteristic and would be glad if you could list some types providing
  these second stems.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n RoyBasch\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Don't
  mind the internet's restrictions, I would use this type to generate an image for
  each blog entry."

    engraved, handtooled, and others I'm forgetting.\r\n\r\nITC, for example, issued
    a series of \"handtooled\" versions of some of their popular faces (Goudy, Century,
    Garamond).\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=handtooled&x=0&y=0\r\n\r\nThere
    are more contemporary faces with the same treatment, of course. FF Scala has an
    engraved option, for example:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_jewel/\r\n\r\nFont
    Bureau's beautiful Narcissus uses this effect:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=narcissus&x=0&y=0\r\n\r\nAnd
    there are dozens, if not hundreds more..."

    that.\r\n\r\nFontshop gets so much promotion from Typophile and having its type

    the archives will show that I link to MyFonts and other vendors quite often. Yes,
    I represent FontShop, but I do my best to link to the site only when I think it
    will be helpful to the discussion.\r\n\r\n> \u201CI can\u2019t get past the idea
    that the site is really just a guerrilla marketing vehicle for FontShop, Font
    Bureau, Veer and Villa.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat's a strange notion. The Typophile forums
    contain many, many more links to MyFonts than to any other vendor. Add to this
    the fact that MyFonts is one of many Typophile sponsors, with an ad in the right
    column, and the statement seems even more absurd."

  body: "I tried some free fonts such as Alderney Engraved, Academy Engraved LET plain
    or BD Engraved, but none of them suited the blog design the way I imagined or
    just didn't work in sizes smaller than 34pt (looks noisy though the second stem
    looks clearly)...\r\n\r\nIgnoring the personal quarrels, the linked website has
    a nice catalogue of fonts resembling my idea. My favourite font among them is
    ITC Cheltenham Handtooled Std Bold but since I am a non-expert user the price
    of 35,00\u20AC (appr. 49,35$) seems disproportionate to me. Apart from that it
    works fine in a size of 21pt...\r\n\r\nAnyway!\r\n@frode frank: Eason Inline Caps
    is in deed an interesting font style though its fluid appearance doesn't fit into
    my concept. This font looks to me as being predestined for an advert of a noble,
    classy perfume. (Whatever, don't mind...)\r\n\r\nWorking out an own handtooled
    version of Georgia or other popular Transitional fonts seems to be the best way
    to add the favoured impression. Unfortunately, since I have never designed a type
    before or even thought about it, I guess this handcraft is a bit too tough for
    me to produce a good and consistent piece of typography.\r\n\r\nI will keep looking
    for a free font matching my idea.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n RoyBasch\r\n\r\nPS:

    what a wonderful surprise! As Typophile is constantly looking for extra hands
    to help the Typophile community, they will greatly appreciate you volunteering
    to invest a considerable amount of your free time to help moderate the boards.
    Your primary task could be to ensure absolute neutrality is preserved in all of
    Typophile's threads and comments. Make sure to bring your \"senior Typophiler\"
    along. :^)\r\n\r\nHappy New Year!"
