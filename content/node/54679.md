body: "I found this lovely condensed sans laying around somewhere. It\u2019s a PostScript
  font from 1997 and a search for its name comes up empty. Does anyone recognize it?
  Might it be a typeface borrowed from another and renamed? I need to find a cross
  platform Open Type face that's a good match if not the same one. \r\n\r\nThe #4
  is especially telling and the high cap height is unique as well.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's a really sweet face. We used it for a client's website and just assumed
    that the print projects would employ it as well. But if we can't find a licensed
    PC version to buy we'll have to choose something else. Too bad, it's a beautiful
    face in usage.  Short ascenders and descenders, high x-height and round shapes
    that have a nice edge to them.
