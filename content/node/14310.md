  is logical. I created a class based on lowercase \u201Ca\u201D left side and another
  based on the right side of the same letter (after I added all the matching-side
  characters to it's appropriate class, created other claases, and so on for almost
  every glyph in the font).\r\n\r\nSo, my question is: was creating two kerning classes
  based on the same character logical, adequate and a working possibility?\r\n\r\nthx!"

    covered all the bases from what little I can tell so far.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'Building right and left kerning classes makes perfect sense. Consider lowercase
    k: generally, you wouldn''t need any kerning for letters which fell to the left
    of the character if it had a straight stem, but the characters falling to the
    right often have to be kerned.  Likewise, again generally, uppercase B, D, F,
    K, L, P, and R.'

  body: "I think it's a good idea to create separate right and left classes for the
    same glyph. Otherwise, all the glyphs in a given class must be similar on both
    sides. For example, a left kern class might include b, o, and p. A right kern
    class might include c, d, e, o, and q. \r\n\r\nNote that o is in both of these
    classes. You have to be careful, though, if you put one glyph in more than one
    class, not to set it up so that it kerns to another class more than once. For
    example, if in addition to the classes listed above, you also had a left kern
    class that included o, \xF3, \xF2, and \xF6, and then kerned both left kern classes
    against the same right kern class, FontLab would object when you compile the features
    with an error message saying that some kerning pairs may never be accessed (or
    something like that). Sorry if this sounds confusing--it is."

  body: "One more tip:\r\n\r\nWhen you create left and right kern classes, for your
    own sanity, include the words \"right\" and \"left\" or \"r\" and \"l\" in the
    names so you can tell which is which."
