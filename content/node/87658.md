body: "Guys, I have been working with the illustrator pen tool, and have noticed that
  while drawing a new point the entire path disappears until I release the mouse button
  ( placing the new anchor ). \r\n\r\nIs there a way to see the entire drawn path
  while placing new points so I can see where my anchor is in relation to the form?
  \r\n\r\nI know this may be a tad confusing. Please let me know if you understand
  or if I need further clarification..."
