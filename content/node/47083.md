body: "Between Orleans and Jefferson both, you would think that these people would
  get their stuff together when considering civil engineering and what not. It seems
  like they've been working on the same section of the I-10 for the last fifteen years
  at least! They widen the 6-10 split..a year later, they're shutting it down to widen
  it again. I've got an idea...how about they make it really big, one time, and then
  never have to worry about it again! \r\nAnother thing that makes New Orleans unique
  is the way they position street signs! If you're going down a one way, the signs
  that tell you what street you're on are positioned so that only the people going
  the opposite way can tell what street they're on (that is, if they're even there.)
  \r\nI know it seems like I come down on my city all of the time, but when you're
  a native you have no choice but to notice the things that are so back asswards about
  it. Although I have a somewhat jaded outlook, it's these little idosyncracies that
  make me laugh and appriciate the character of my city. \r\n\r\nps. Why is it that
  no one is from Chalmette, only \"the parish\"? I still can't figure that one out."

    government is like this pretty much everywhere. In DC the best library and a large
    apartment building burned down last year because the Water and Sewer Authority
    wasn\u2019t bothering to keep water running to the fire hydrants!"
