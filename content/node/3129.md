  body: If the real font isn&#39;t available, for something with a very similar flavor,
    try <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html">Forsythe</a>.
    You&#39;ll have to scroll down the page for it.

  body: To me it looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/tasse/blackwide/"
    target="_blank">Font Bureau&#39;s Tasse</a>, the Black Wide variant. Many of their
