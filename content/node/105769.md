body: "This is somewhat of a pleasure personal friend project, so I thought it would
  be a good time to challenge myself to create my first custom script. Having made
  it to this point and facing a bit of a deadline, now I'm aching for some critique
  from those more experienced than myself.\r\n\r\nI love how the \"R\" and \"o\" interact
  and I've been trying to base the rest of the script around those shapes. Overall,
  I'm really liking the direction here, but there are some areas that are really giving
  my headaches- The \"L\", lowercase \"r\", \"e\", and just some of the weights and
  curves in general. I've also been trying to incorporate some kind of underline element
  like what is below, but I'm not sure how to carry that through and balance it out
  on the \"Lunar\" side.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts and advice are super appreciated! I know
  that there are some glaring areas here, but feel free to nitpick on the details
  if you so choose.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LunarRogue_Logo_AlbumLogo_Comp_130816-02_5115.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LunarRogue_Logo_AlbumLogo_Comp_130816-03_4377.png]"

  body: The loop of the L looks hesitant and weak in comparison to the sharp quickness
    of the R. You should probably lose the loop and make the L of two strokes. This
    will make it easier to elongate the bottom stroke across the word to balance the
    other underline. Since they will be near each other, plump the end of the underline
    and shape it to look similar to the end of the L, rotationally.

  body: "Thanks cerulean!\r\n\r\nRemoving the loop of the L is helping a lot but still
    not feeling right yet... Working on it now. I'll post an update soon."

  body: "Here's where I currently am with this. I've adjusted every part of the L,
    while making it bigger and the R smaller. The R felt so overpowering. \r\n\r\nThe
    underline of \"Rogue\" still feels really awkward to me. When it extended under
    all of Rogue, it weighed the whole thing down, so I've shortened it, but I'm not
    convinced this is the proper solution. I tried making it follow the same curve
    as the L (flipped horizontally), but that wasn't quite working either.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you guys think?\r\n\r\nThanks!!!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LunarRogue_Logo_AlbumLogo_Comp_130826-02_4114.png]"

  body: Does "lunar" refer to the moon? If so, have you considered incorporating a
    moon image into the logo somehow?

    body: "Yes it does refer to the moon. I've actually been trying to avoid moon
      references, though. This is meant to be more of a representation of the classic-style
      melodic music that the band produces. I had thought about it though :)\r\n\r\nThe
      band already really likes this, so I'd really love some nitpicking on the detail
      work of the logo; really making sure that all of the characters are fluid, cohesive,
      and well-crafted. I'm really not sure If I', sold on my execution of the L,
      r, e, underline, and weights of the characters. \r\n\r\nThis truly is my first
      script, so I feel like I really need the critique. It's a bit daunting."
