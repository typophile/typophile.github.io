  body: "Hullo, \r\n\r\nIMVHO, it works and I really like the font, although I would
    tend to think that\r\n\r\nacs may be too wide (g is good, though, use this as
    a model, perhaps?)\r\nbdpqft may be too narrow\r\ni and o might be too dark (probably)\r\nfhktvx
    may be too narrow \r\nk may also have too high a 'waist'\r\n\r\nCEFGL may create
    gaps in the line\r\nOQN TMSZ may be too dark or light\r\n\r\nalso I see the same
    forms repeated too often:\r\ne.g. the dot is where it ok on the i but not on the
    j (too close to the right)\r\ne.g. in p and q, the \"cuts\" (for want of a better
    term) are good on the bottom part but not marked enough on the top part (& vice
    versa for the top part)\r\ne.g. I have never seen a W which is an inverted M and
    which works\r\ne.g. EF (check Trajan/Pro & you'll understand).\r\ne.g. A (the
    horizontal bar! - check Stencil & you'll see)\r\ne.g. OQ\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is v tricky
    to homogenise a font like that without being repetitive and to adjust the weight
    because you don't have much latitude in terms of changing the size of the horizontals
    and the verticals, but it should be feasible. I would love to see this font finished!\r\n\r\nA
    good way, I think of adjusting a font like that is to take the best two or three
    characters. Say they are IVO, first adjust them so they have the same optical
    weight, and sizes which create a good rhythm. Second, play with every character
    in an IVO sequence. e.g. IVOAOVI or IAIAVAOAI (spacing them excessively may help).
    Then adjust letters for width first, to get good rhythms. Once this is done, start
    again and adjust weight. Then work on the lowercase (using for example glm) in
    the same way. Always pay attention to what is better in your favourite characters,
    try to fix the equivalent problem in the others, but do it visually, not by using
    the same point coordinates. Example: the 'cuts' on the top of your m seem to be
    the best of the font to me, try to widen others so they match OPTICALLY, not mathematically.
    You'll see you need different values to have something visually/optically balanced
    (you may also see that your first cut in the m is too 'shy' when compared with
    the second). As you create less mathematical homogeneity in the font, you'll actually
    create more visual/optical homogeneity. I am of the opinion that you need a 'round'
    (say o/O) and a 'vertical' character (say h/H, n/N) as benchmarks, so perhaps
    start working on them immediately after having adjusted your favourite characters,
    then use them as a benchmark instead of your favourite characters.\r\nLast but
    not least, when you encounter a difficulty, look at recognised fonts which have
    solved the problems you are facing. The good cuts of Univers & Avenir show you
    how to cheat with the widths of the verticals and diagonals; Ambroise will show
    you how to cheat with the counter forms and so forth...\r\n\r\nPS apologies for
    not always using the proper typographic words, I work on typography in different
    languages & I constantly get confused...\r\nPPS I would love people to tell me
    where I am wrong, and why! \r\n\r\n"
