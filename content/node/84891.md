  I'm not 100% committed to Paperback, but it looks nice with Futura. Anyway, I'm
  interested in using some ornaments on the document but am unsure if they fit with
  the modern look of Futura. Is there a good resource or rule of thumb regarding the
  use of ornaments? I get a little confused when I'm combining something contemporary
  - like what House Industry offers with old standards like Futura. I'm wondering
  if there is a resource out there that explains more about how and when to use ornaments
  with sans serif fonts?\r\n\r\nIs this making sense?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\na"

    enough to create contrast.

    and traditional typeface can work nicely to create juxaposition. Then chose a
    glyph that supports the mood. If you are going for modern try a modern looking
    glyph.\r\n\r\nI really like Bodoni with Futura. In The Elements of Typographic
    Style, Robert Brighurst says that Bodoni breathes much of the same spirit as Futura
    since they both aspire to geometric purity. img:Bodoni-Futura_4580.jpg]"

    the text and Futura for headlines \u2013 the obvious but admittedly more boring
    way? (Even more boring though: Futura and Bodoni.) The ornaments contribute to
    the unusual, fresh feel. Works well I think. \r\n\r\nBut don\u2019t indent the
    first line of a column."
