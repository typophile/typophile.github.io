    a bit much.\r\n\r\nAs for being able to convey a specific locale with a typeface,
    there are of course severe limits, but just like you can choose a font that says
    \"London\" for example more than some other font, you can certainly <em>make</em>
    a font that says Canberra to some degree. When you see it, you feel it, or you
    don't. The main problem with Canberra here is that very few non-Australians (and
    possibly not even a huge proportions of Australians) have any identifiable feeling
    of it.\r\n\r\nRelated - my old review of Lisboa here:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/on-typography/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2005/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "FYI Canberra is a \"bureaucrat's\" city -- lots of government offices, like
    a mini version of Washington DC. The Australian parliament is there, so is the
    National Library (awesome library). The defense department is there, so is the
    prestigious Australian military college (used to be called Duntroon). The Australian
    National University (ANU) is there, plus a couple of other smaller universities.
    The city itself is beautifully designed from ground-up by Burley Griffin (Chicago
    architects).\r\n\r\nI guess if one can devise a typeface that says \"government
    efficiency\", then you could apply it to Canberra.  However, Canberra is *not*
    a representative of Australia.  Sydney and Melbourne have  a totally different
    feel.\r\n\r\nIs there a typeface for Brussels or Washington DC ?"

    guess if one can devise a typeface that says \"government efficiency\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    suspect they instead would want to shed that image. An identity isn't just about
    what something is, but what something wants to be.\r\n\r\nBTW when I first heard
    about the resistance to so-called \"spec work\" among design organizations, my
    instincts smelled a rat. Eventually, I caught the rat: they don't like the idea
    because it costs the established elite (who mutually-validate such organizations)
    client projects = money. The elite want to continue charging half a million dollars
    for putting two Helvetica letters next to each other... And if they can get paid
    for only delivering a proposal that gets rejected (nevermind because it sucked)
    that's nice too. Basically, they want to be the ones usurping/repressing young
    talent instead of clients usurping/promoting it... So letting talented newborn
    designers get a foot in the door (without having to slave for years for large
    design studios, sometimes thereby losing their fruitful individuality) is a positive
    side. Why do some upcoming talents also oppose spec work? Maybe because they want
    to be among the elite eventually... I guess it's a matter of how one approaches
    life: work menially for years and eventually land in a cushy establishment position,
    versus become culturally significant quickly and hopefully keep innovation at
    the heart of your work. Some people start planning for their retirement when they're
    18, others never do. To me something in between is best. Ergo: spec work can be
    problematic (like when an organization charges for people to compete) but it's
    still a natural part of human competitiveness.\r\n\r\nAn even nicer positive side
    is that cities wanting a bespoke typeface is awesome news for us. There's like
    thousands of them!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Since the other thread* has taken on the mainstream aspects of this topic,
    it might be worthwhile to earnestly address what seems to be Rosetta's (great
    name for a type designer BTW :-) original intent in this thread: what <em>is</em>
    Australian typography?\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/101651\r\n\r\nI'm not
    Australian, but I'm deeply fascinated with conveying ethnicity in type design.
    Anybody who thinks it's pretty limited -especially in text face design- is totally
    right; anybody who thinks is totally irrelevant is dead wrong.\r\n\r\nSomething
    small I've written addressing this issue is my review of Lisboa here:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/on-typography/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2005/\r\n\r\nI
    think of Australia and Canada as the \"suburbs\" of the core Anglo cultures; it's
    almost like they're US states - in fact to make a point I often refer to Canada
    as the Hockey State... This means it's easier for them to import culture than
    to generate it. But if we can get them to generate more of their own culture the
    world would be a richer place. So how can Australia be motivated in this way?
    Maybe this competition could help, but of course there must be much more.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "At first, when I saw the topic of this thread, comparing it to a thread about
    the Greek typographical situation, also added, my initial attitude was derisive.
    But it didn't take too long for me to realize my mistake.\r\n\r\nBritish typography
    is distinct from American typography, despite the two countries having the same
    language; and the typography of other Latin-alphabet nations is also even more
    distinctive; for example, that of Germany and that of France.\r\n\r\nAustralian
    typography is already distinctive - although similar to British typography, it
    admits some admixture of American elements. Canadian typography, on the other
    hand, at least superficially, might be viewed as essentially identical to American
    typography.\r\n\r\nThat's not quite true; there are Canadian typefounders - some
    of whom participate in this very forum - and every country's typography is the
    product of the finite number of individuals who are its typographers. But the
    difference isn't obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960's, a Canadian \"Sunday supplement\"
    - it actually appeared in the Saturday editions of newspapers, as our blue laws
    were stricter than those in much of the U.S. at the time - <em>Weekend</em> magazine
    - was set in Optima. That may have been a bit more adventurous than common in
    the U.S. at the time.\r\n\r\n@hrant:\r\n<cite>I think of Australia and Canada
    as the \"suburbs\" of the core Anglo cultures; it's almost like they're US states
    - in fact to make a point I often refer to Canada as the Hockey State... This
    means it's easier for them to import culture than to generate it. But if we can
    get them to generate more of their own culture the world would be a richer place.</cite>\r\n\r\nOne
    can't argue with that. But one can argue with some of the means used to achieve
    this goal. I lost access to two of my favorite TV shows - <em>Mission: Impossible</em>
    and <em>The Beverly Hillbillies</em> - in my youth thanks to Trudeau's \"Canadian
    Content\" policies.\r\n\r\nEconomic factors do mean that with a market a tenth
    the size, production values will suffer for movies - and the current state of
    the movie market is such that even Hollywood is suffering. Because going to the
    theatre is so expensive, audiences demand blockbusters like <em>Star Wars</em>
    or <em>Avatar</em> for their money."

  body: Hrant, in your original comment about Canada, you spoke in terms of Canada
    importing culture rather than generating it. In your response to my comment, you
    shifted to talking about failure to <em>export</em> culture (such that you might
    learn something about it). There's a big difference between accusing a country
    of not generating a distinctive culture and not exporting it. It's not as if we're
    dependent on external opinion to validate our culture.

    that worthwhile original contributions do end up getting exported, without anybody
    even really trying. So if Americans aren't importing a given element of Canadian
    culture, it's either because they already have it, or they don't think it's a
    big enough deal.\r\n\r\nBTW, FWIW: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22213218\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
