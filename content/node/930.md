body: Some first raw sketches of a font to be used for logotypes. It is inspired by
  the wide capital letters in the corporate logotypes from companies like SHARP, BNP
  PARIBAS, INTERSHOP. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typografie.info/logotypia.gif"

  think of a version with overlapping letters, and lots of ampersands and ligatures.
  <BR> <BR>What do you think? <BR> <BR>Ralf <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Just one negative: it looks like it&#39;s been mechanically stretched
    wider. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Ralf, that&#39;s really coming along... good stuff. It seems really complete...
    the only thing that jumps out at me is the tildes and umlauts seem more prominent
    than the circumflexes and so on. Maybe it&#39;s just an optical illusion... but
    looking at the A-tilde, it seems incredibly top-heavy.

    I&#39;m a Bulgarian. I&#39;d rather use a rotated Roman &#34;V&#34; for the cyrillic

    <BR> <BR>They are fine just as they are. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;  I&#39;d
    rather use a rotated Roman &#34;V&#34; for the cyrillic capital &#34;L&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>...yes there are variations of this kind with these characters &#40;D and
    L&#41; in diferent cyrillic languages. <BR> <BR>'
