body: Ok, here goes... <BR> <BR>I have an OT font with the &#34;kern&#34; feature
  defined and <BR>class based kerning. The font and all of its related <BR>kerning
  works fine in OSX. When I try to install <BR>the font into ATM Deluxe 4.6 under
  Classic I receive <BR>an error message saying the font cannot be activated. <BR>If
  I delete the &#34;kern&#34; feature the font activates fine but <BR>of course doesn&#39;t
  have kerning for any of my classes. <BR> <BR>What gives? <BR>Clearly there is a
  work around as my Adobe OT fonts <BR>activate and work under Classic. <BR> <BR>&#40;The
  font in question was generated under OSX 10.3.5 with FL 4.6 <BR>The &#34;kern&#34;
  feature contents are the result of using the &#34;Apply <BR>and Save&#34; button
  under the OpenType Kerning Assistance&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks
