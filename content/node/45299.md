body: "This was a question a couple of weeks ago. It was interesting enough for me
  to go and try to program it! My first attempts were pixel based, but this one is
  a full-fledged Windows application which outputs a printed image -- I recommend
  printing to a PDF, so you can test various settings at your leisure.\r\n\r\nIt looks
  like this (slightly bigger than here):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textimage_prg_5709.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
  can be downloaded for your pleasure at [[http://www.jongware.com/binaries/textimage1beta.zip|my
  own little space of the web]] (thass a direct download link). It works allright
  under XP, don't have a Vista nearby so I can't try that out...\r\n\r\nFirst, a tip:
  don't <em>stress test</em> it! It's a quicky, written in something like 5 or 6 hours,
  and any weird input will surely crash it... The \"preview\" is more of a gimmick,
  it doesn't really tries the transform. Perhaps later...\r\n\r\nIt only accepts BMP
  files (but since it only works under Windows anyway, I don't see reasons for complaints
  -- also, loading any graphic file is <em>hard</em>!). On the plus side, you can
  directly drag your BMPs on it, and type or paste text directly into the RTF box.
  Any formatting will be lost in the output, though.\r\n\r\nIf you need access to
  a Page Setup box, hold the Shift key while pressing Print (I ran out of screen estate).\r\n\r\nA
  tiny teaser: Che looks like this.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextImage_4265.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
  you see, it works best with \"iconic\" images that are still recognizable in this
  coarse resolution. That's where the icon and sample came from; old Al is pretty
  iconic by now.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."

    I can use that. Thanks You!

    focused on ASCII art, which is definitely something else. As no-one seemed to
    know how to do it, I made it myself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a Mac based typographer <em>cum</em>

    this when I saw your original thread, but didn't (and still don't) have the time
    to play around with it.\r\n\r\nIf you're amenable to opening up your source code,
    I might be able to build a Mac version. I'm familiar with FreeType and a few programming
    languages. Not necessarily fluent but maybe enough to port...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Josh,\r\n\r\nThanks for the offer! But I'm not quite there yet :-)\r\nYesterday,
    I added a single line (okay, maybe 2) and the justification was spot on (now it
    isn't) AND it's +/- 20% faster ... So, still tinkering. I'm considering changing
    the justify routine altogether, as it's now held together by spit and tape.\r\n\r\nThis
    version doesn't use FreeType at all, so a straightforward port to Mac could be
    a major pain, because the initial measurements are done with pure Windows calls.
    On the other hand, after that it's number crunching time, so ... perhaps ...\r\n\r\nBut,
    as I said, it's not quite fully developed. I still have some novel ideas -- I
    wonder how good it can get."

    know. As I mentioned I don't really have the time to do something from scratch,
    but if it were possible to work from an existing code base would likely spare
    some development time. This is something interesting and fun.\r\n\r\nIt may or
    may not be an issue that your measurements, etc. are done purely with Windows
    calls for the font metrics and such...I could use the corresponding Mac OS system
    routines, or use FreeType, or if necessary read the font files directly. Which
    programming language is this written in?\r\n\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The reason my first tries were with FreeType is because I'm not that comfortable
    with win coding :-) and I'm still developing <em>some</em> FreeType skills. It
    was pretty easy to write a proof of concept, though.\r\nThen I realized I couldn't
    create a <em>vector</em> image that way -- only pixel based, and that was a real
    drag.\r\n\r\nSo I switched to pure Windows, using its native print routines. It
    turned out to have its own weird stuff. D'ya know that if you select a printer,
    you're stuck with its resolution, in integers only? So using floating point coordinates
    is off ... Also, it's <em>impossible</em> to scale a font to non-integer sizes!
    And I'm having a hard time getting relevant font data from this cursed system
    :-) So much for Myriad Pro Semibold at 8.5 pts; Windows doesn't allow either!
    At best, it explains some of Word's intricacies.\r\n\r\nThat's the Bad & Ugly
    news. Good news is that the hard work can be done (I think) in your programming
    language of choice -- given that you have (a) an image to sample, (b) an array
    of fonts and sizes (with access to their metrics on a character basis), (c) a
    large chunk of filler text, and (d) the dimensions and a pointer to some 'canvas'
    to write the results to. My version is in plain C, but the logic in the hard work
    loop should be portable enough. Originally, I was considering a PostScript version
    -- now <em>that</em> would be something! (drool) (okay, not now)\r\n\r\nYour website
    doesn't mention contact details, but you can reach me through my domain, using
    my first name as e-mail address. Intentionally oblique, to fool spambots ... (God,
    how I hate spam! Don't get me started on that.)"

  body: Theunis, I was wondering whether you take into account the exact font metrics,
    what I mean whether you calculate the area occupied by the black of the glyph
    vs. the bounding rectangle? (If you have five weights 1...superlight 5...superbold)
    it might happen, that in a font weight 3 m is darker in tone than a weight 4 n
    e.g., especially in monowidth fonts).

  body: "An excellent observation!\r\nNo, I don't do that. That means that the \"distance\"
    in gray between, say, 4 pt Arial and 5 pt Arial and 6 pt Arial is the same for
    each. As characters are square objects, this should be a logarithmic difference
    instead (?? -- pretty sure about that...).\r\n\r\nYou can influence this by eyeballing
    it with the Curves option, but I think I know how to make it more \"exact\" (read:
    \"less inexact\"). It's not the bounding box, because this has the same black-to-white
    ration for each of the different sizes :-) Instead, I should check against the
    coverage of each size against the <em>total line height</em> of the line -- that
    is, the height of the biggest font size. So a 4 pt Arial Black is much lighter
    than a 12 pt Univers Light, on a line heigth of 12 pts.\r\n\r\nThe <em>actual</em>
    gray values are not that important, though. What's more important is the different
    <em>ratio</em> from one level to another, those you can now set manually. That
    should/could be an automatic setting."

  body: "Ouch. I don't know how I could be so unattentive. I believed you used different
    _weights_ of the font, not different _sizes_. I guess, I did not look at the pictures,
    but only remembered your sentence in the original topic (using the word \"weight\").\r\nI
    thought you were using the same font in ultra-light, light, medium, black, ultrablack
    or something like that. Sorry for the misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI really should
    have looked more carefully."

  body: "No need for apologies! It works just as fine with different weights. Or even
    different <em>fonts</em> (although you're on your own for selecting the gray values).\r\n\r\nI
    just finished adding a few interface niceties: a <strong>Save</strong> and a <strong>Load</strong>
    button, so you can save (and load) the font list. You can also manage the list
    itself, moving stuff up and down and editing with a quick double-flick on the
    font name. You can save the settings as \"defaults.fis\", which will set the defaults
    (...).\r\n\r\nThis version has a different <em>name</em>: somewhat more appropriate,
    <strong>FontImage</strong>. I noticed \"TextImage\" was already used for ASCII
    art apps, this is definitely something else :-) (Thanks to Tim Satink for that
    name.)\r\n\r\nThe new version, again available  [[http://www.jongware.com/binaries/fontimage.1.1.zip|at
    my site]] (direct link), features a slightly faster printing and better justification.
    Some bugs included -- still no guarantees."
