  body: Looks like the bottom is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/din-1451/mittelschrift/testdrive.html?s=02%2FI+LOVE+SNOW&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">DIN 1451</a>... and the top is... <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/din-1451/ef-mittel-neu/testdrive.html"
    target="_blank">DIN 1451 EF</a>?

  body: I wasn&#39;t so sure myself... the top might also be a different weight of
    regular DIN 1451.

  body: I&#39;m not sure how that would work... It&#39;s a perfectly  smooth S in
    DIN 1451, but one with curves in the top text. Can weighting do that? <BR> <BR><a

    <BR> <BR>There&#39;s where I saw it, maybe it&#39;s just showing up weird on my
    PC since it&#39;s flash text.

  body: I think it might be because it&#39;s in Flash text... I wish people wouldn&#39;t
    lock their flash items so we could zoom in like we used to and find these things
    out for sure... how does <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/regular/testdrive.html"
    target="_blank">FF DIN Regular</a> look?  If it&#39;s not quite what you&#39;re
    looking for, try browsing through the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=48&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=SNOW+IS+FUN"
