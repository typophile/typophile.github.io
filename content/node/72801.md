  happen to recognize the font?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mc2_4084.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  help appreciated, thanks."

  body: Of course it is possible that this sample is not from a pre-fab font at all
    and has been hand-drawn from scratch. I can't be sure, though somehow my instinct
    tells me otherwise. I think it *is* a font, though perhaps customized in some
    way, as you said. Anyway, who knows, maybe someone has seen it before? It looks
    vaguely familiar.

  body: "I feel like it probably is customized, but in my search to see if it could
    be in the public eye, I found <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/laser/\">this</a>.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a font called Laser, it's pretty obviously not the font, but the \"M\" has some
    blaring similarities. Could be a lead?"
