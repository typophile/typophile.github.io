  body: "Hi James,\r\n\r\nthe first one is a little bit too small to be sure, but
    I\u2019d say <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-grouch/\">Grouch</a>.\r\nAnd
    the second is some black condensed flavour of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/familytree.html\">Futura</a>.\r\nF"
