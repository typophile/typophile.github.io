  Friends I would like to inform you that from October the 17th, 2006, The Castle
  of Enterprise and Art in Cieszyn and The Silesian Library in Katowice hosts, under
  supervision of local authorities, an exhibition which presents and concludes the
  project of a new typeface design: Silesiana 2006.\r\n\r\nSilesiana 2006 is the first
  project of a type rooted in regional tradition, made in Poland after World War II
  and supported by local government. The authors are: Artur Frankowski (Warsaw)\u2014a
  young generation typographer working with digital tools, Polish representative on
  ATypI Forum, and Henryk Sakwerda (Katowice)\u2014classic typographer, working with
  calligraphy, author of many types awarded before the digital era.\r\n\r\nThe organisers
  are very proud of the result and hope that the project will continue. We would like
  to encourage Polish authorities to pay attention to typography as a part of the
  local culture, worth to be developed and supported. Katowice is a town in Silesia\u2014south,
  industrial region of multicultural influences from Czech, Germany, and Poland. Its
  athmosphere is recognisable in the characters' shape, colour and light.\r\n\r\nThe
  conference and the opening of the exhibition of Silesiana 2006 typeface will take
  place on November the 15th, 2006. The main subject of the conference is the regional
  influence on types. The guests of honour are: Gerry Leonidas, Verena Gerlach, Filip
  Blazek, Adam Twardoch, Artur Frankowski, Henryk Sakwerda.\r\n\r\nStudents from Polish
  art and design schools, designers and teachers of design are invited for a discussion.\r\n\r\nParticipation
  in the conference is free for Polish and international guests. Those interested
  in a hotel reservation are kindly requested to contact the organisers at: info@zamekcieszyn.pl\r\n\r\nTopics
  of presentations\r\n\r\nArtur Frankowski\r\nRegional influences in Polish typography.\r\n\r\nGerry
  Leonidas\r\nEuropean Type Design.\r\n\r\nFilip Blazek\r\nOverview of History of
  Czech Typefaces from 1900 to 2006.\r\n\r\nVerena Gerlach\r\nKarbid And Citystreettypes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe
  hope it will be a very fruitful and interesting meeting focused on how the coexistence
  of Polish, Czech and German culture on the Silesia territory is reflected in the
  shapes of types.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nRead more at: http://www.zamekcieszyn.pl\r\n\r\nMy
