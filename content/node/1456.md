  is welcome on this logotype, still working on it, its for a photography portfolio,
  automotive-related. crit is welcome. sorry if i posted this twice, not sure where
  the other one went. readability is not a huge concern.

    another  <BR>pass. &#40;e.g., is that &#39;hi&#39; ligature helping or hindering?

    will someone assume it says traphik and forget about it and just see the logotype
    as a symbol or will someone try to make sure the letters spell something? i agree
    the A is very close to R '

  body: Phil _ Joe makes some valid points, but the &#42;readability&#42; question
    is hard to figure unless you tell us who is going to traffic traphik. <BR> <BR>If
    a &#39;graf&#39; crowd is going there, then your logo is &#42;too&#42; readable.
    You probably know what I mean. If it&#39;s a general audience, then maybe the
    hi ligature needs to be explained, the A fixed, etc. <BR> <BR>I do like how the
    dot on the i has a sense of balance with the ear of the r. <BR> <BR>The best/clever
    part of the logo is the tread/traffic idea. You might strengthen that. <BR>I pulled
    down some guides on the logo. I don&#39;t know, maybe pulling it into a grid might
    help it achieve a sense of balance.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1734.jpg"

  body: ' I&#39;m glad you did that. I def need some more alignment with the figures
    that are almost the same height. the very first version of this logo was very
    aligned and it didn&#39;t come across as tire tread. It&#39;s funny- my original
    idea was to make a logotype that resembled the &#60;&#60; signs that tell you
    a sharp left corner is coming up... '

  body: ' Phil -- I really like this. I don&#39;t think that &#40;perhaps&#41; readability
    should even be mentioned &#40;?&#41; For instance, the 3rd character from the
    left could almost &#40;also?&#41; be an &#39;R&#39;. Only within context does
    it read as an &#39;A&#39;. The only character that could perhaps use some &#39;tweaking&#39;
    is the &#39;T&#39; -- Did you try a lowercase &#39;t&#39;? -- Looking at it again,
    in a strange way the &#39;T&#39; looks like an &#39;R&#39;. -- Anyway, I do like
    it and the cryptic nature of it is what I like most about it. '

    some yellow paint on it that makes the logo visible. but heres a more &#34;legible&#34;

  body: ' My Chinese horoscope sign Monkey, mister. I dangle good. <BR> <BR>Put simply:
    <BR>Legibility depends on letterforms that are easy to decipher. Readability depends
    on letterforms that come together to form boumas &#40;word shapes&#41; that are
    easy to decipher. BTW, the &#34;style&#34; of decipherment depends on the reading
    state &#40;contemplative versus immersive&#41;. <BR> <BR>A couple of real-world
    implications: legible fonts have bigger x-heights that readable fonts. Sans fonts
    are more legible but less readable. <BR> <BR>hhp '
