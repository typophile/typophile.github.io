body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alley_logo_5300.jpg]\r\nI'm expanding the
  logo above into a full set of uppercase characters to be used on posters and flyers
  for the theatre. I'm trying to keep the characteristics intact, like the strong
  letterforms and low crossbar on the A. I want the letters to look more like type
  on the sides of old factory buildings or 30s era WPA posters rather than mechanical
  or robotic.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alley_set_2_6114.jpg]\r\nThis
  set of letters is what I was going for but I want to make sure letters like the
  M, N, X, and K fit with the rest of the type.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alley_set_1_5191.jpg]\r\nI
  tried to make the letters more a like but I think the M, N, X, K now look a bit
  too sci-fi or robotic.\r\n\r\nI've also included a couple of alternate character
  designs that I haven't decided on yet like Q and S. I haven't finished adding all
  the pylons for the stencil look, but I've got a start on it. Any feedback would
  be appreciated.\r\n"

  body: Interesting work, Matt. One thing I'm noticing is that the letters without
    a stencil-cut feel heavier than the ones with a cut. I'd be interested in seeing
    a solid and stencil version with a bit more consistency.

  body: "I do need to finish adding the stencil cuts to most of the letters. I haven't
    decided yet if I should add them to all the letters that wouldn't actually need
    them to function as a stencil. It seems to be working with the E, F, L and S.
    I don't know how yet to handle it with the Y or T.\r\n\r\nThe logotype is still
    subject to change, so the Y and T might end up with cuts. Suggestions on how to
    handle it? I've looked to [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_oxide_stencil_ot_regular/|FF
    Oxide Stencil]] for some inspiration, but not all the letters feature a pylon
    since the Stencil version is for actually cutting stencils I'm sure, not just
    the style of the stencil letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read

    Stencil</a> cuts it differently.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to see a 2 stroke Y as an
    alternative.\r\n\r\nAs far as lowering the crossbars, I'd try it, but you're likely
    to get looking pretty funky. Either way, just make sure you do it on the G, too
    if you do."

    just keep the K and A as they are or raise the crossbars. Which looks better?

  body: "Looks good. I think it was a good choice to at least make alternative characters
    for the higher crossbar. The new cuts help a lot and I REALLY like the new Y.
    Fits the typeface better. The first of each of the M N W are my choice, but if
    you can include alternatives, I'd keep em hiding in the background. \r\n\r\nThe
    one thing I notice now is that the 4 doesn't feel as boxy as the rest of the glyphs.
    I'd see if you could draw it in a more fork-ish shape. Possibly borrowing from
    the first Y."

    a little more letterspacing for the logo. Some of the cuts are causing letters

    the show, but summer will do that to you."

    like it too. I would keep all alternatives. This way you won't have problems in
    the logo. \r\n\r\nAs for the logo, to me no. three looks really better, but needs
    some kern. As for the cap 'A': i keep wondering if you could maybe cut the left
    terminal altogether, like the 'E', I keep thinking that in a real stencil it would
    not work like you have now. Take a look at: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/glaser-stencil/]]...\r\n\r\ngood

    I see of the A need more spacing to be even with the rest of the face. I'd be
