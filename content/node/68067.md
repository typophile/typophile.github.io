body: The poster for Tom Fords movie A Single Man displays what seems to me like a
  Gill Sans Medium but in my version of Gill Sans there is no medium. Also the "S"
  is not a perfect match. Are there other versions of Gill Sans that includes a "medium"
  weight?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-single-man-poster-1_5245.jpg]
