  body: "Yes, yes. After actually <em>looking</em> at the sign for a minute I realized
    what it was (sorry for the lazy post on my part). \r\n\r\nI think the original
    designer may simply not have realized you can mix weights in order to have some
    characters larger/taller than others while maintaining visually consistent strokes,
    and so stretched the end characters vertically. In replicating the logotype for
    their new website I've used bold small caps for the guts of the word and regular-weight
    uppercase caps for the end letters. Seems to have <a href=\"http://www.greenboathouse.com/dewinetz/foxgloves_sign.jpg\">worked
    fine</a>."

    posting DIN 1451 Engschrift for identification once. Let's say it wasn't my finest
    hour... ;-) I did remove all evidence of that compromising thread afterwards."
