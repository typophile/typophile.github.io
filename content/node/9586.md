body: Hi Folks! <BR> <BR>I am just getting into the nitty-gritty of making pixel fonts
  and am finding the transfer from Adobe Illustrator to FontLab 4.5 is bringing up
  some questions for me. I would love to hear your thoughts. <BR> <BR>First, It seems
  elementary, but I don&#39;t know how a pixel font is made to appear correctly at
  the size it was designed for. <BR> <BR>I opened Underware&#39;s Unibody8 Italic
  in FontLab to have a look. There are 8 pixels to the ascender, 7 pixels to the cap
  height, and 1 to the descender. <BR> <BR><i>When you choose to use a font at 8pt,
  is that size then made the distance from baseline to ascender?</i> <BR> <BR>&#40;I
  can&#39;t believe this is the first time I have thought about this!&#41; <BR> <BR>Second,
  it seems that the UPM measurement &#40;no matter what it is&#41; is equivalent to
  571.4302px in Illustrator. Anybody else observe this? <BR> <BR>This is a little
  awkward for calculating how to scale the glyphs when they come from Illustrator.
  The difference in size needs to be dealt with at some point and I am trying to find
  the best way.  <BR> <BR><i>What is your favorite method for scaling pixel fonts
  for FontLab, and at which point do you do it?</i> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have the
  luxury of ScanFont just yet, but I will eventually. Is this a smooth process in
  ScanFont with pixel fonts? <BR> <BR>Also, I realize this process is probably rendered
  obsolete by BitFonter, but it&#39;s not worth the money to make a couple pixel fonts.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help! <BR> <BR>-Amy

  body: 'Hey Amy. <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t want to just design directly in FontLab?
    <BR> <BR>To figure out sizes, decide what point size the font will work at. And
    you might choose 8 no matter how many actually pixels the vertical span is &#40;unless
    it&#39;s very large, like 18 or more&#41; for a number of reasons &#40;ask me
    if you really want to know :-&#41;. Divide the EM by that and you&#39;ll get the
    &#34;pixel&#34; size. So if your Em is 1000 and the size is 8, the &#34;pixels&#34;
    will be 125 units tall and wide. <BR> <BR>BTW, about Unibody: its method of defining
    pixels is too brute-force. Besides using too many points, the narrow gaps -like
    any delicate feature in a font- can translate to &#34;discrete noise&#34; &#40;or
    washed-out blacks&#41; at certain sizes &#40;I mean when it&#39;s used outside
    its &#34;native&#34; size&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hey Hrant, <BR> <BR>I like to design in Illustrator because I can see and
    edit all the glyphs at once and I find the editing tools easier to use. <BR> <BR>Just
    to make sure I understand, are you saying that when a font renders at 8 pt, for
    example, it&#39;s 8 points from ascender to descender, i.e., the height of the
    entire Em? <BR> <BR>And, yeah, I know what you mean about Unibody. I have seen
    a few solutions for getting around Flash&#39;s no-overlapping-points bug; that&#39;s
    got to be one of the least elegant. <BR> <BR>thanks.

  body: Yes, the point size equals the em square. The ascender &#43; descender may
    or may not be the same as the em. <BR> <BR>T

  body: ooh, oh yea. it all fits. thank you mister Papazian. you made it really easy.
    <BR>its funny cause after all these months of trying to figure out what the deal
    is with the metrics and ems and pixels. all that the tutorial guys needed to do
    &#40;for the mathematically challenged&#41; is give a screenshot of what the hell
    they were talking about.

  body: "hello, i have drawn a pixel typeface in illustrator and i did the hinting
    myself so i have the sizes 7pt up to 12pt each in the correct size as they should
    appear as a font, that means from top of the ascenders to the bottom line the
    smallest ones are 8 pixels high, the biggest one is 12 pixels high. Now when i
    copy the characters into fontlab they become very tiny and scaling doesnt help
    because the design changes slightly. i have read through the measurement pages
    but i dont get the trick, does someone know how to configure the fontlab file
    to have the characters the same size as in illustrator like the 7pt one should
    be 8 pixels high at 100% but oh god its not.\r\nHelp please "
