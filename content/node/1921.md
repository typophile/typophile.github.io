    &#40;just need a legit excuse to buy it :-&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>Apropos Luc... his
    VolkswagenOSF is marvelous fun. Just not really something I&#39;m allowed to use...
    but one of the cleanest Futura-remixes I know. His OSF are making this overused
    and exploited old face work for me again...  <BR> <BR>Other than that I&#39;m
    back with very plain serif typefaces in the OTF pro version, like Caslon , Garamond,
    Warnock... almost an entirely new kind of ballgame with the Open Type features.  <BR>

  body: Luxury is a funny concept, and it is aptly priced for what it stands for.
    But for me, generally speaking, I would be more inclined to pay more money for
    a well-made text typeface that I know I&#39;m going to use a lot than an expensive
    display type. Text faces take more skill and time to make and refine.

  body: 'Keith, maybe I am thinking the wrong way about this, but it seems to me only
    fashion advertisers will want to use &#39;Luxury&#39;, and they will have the
    money and want the exclusivity. <BR> <BR>But with Trinite, an amazing text face,
    the whole world might want it, like Times New Roman. By the way, Lexicon, which
    TEFF compares to Times New Roman as far as versatility, and which Tiffany wants,
    is also priced similarly in the stratosphere.  <BR> <BR>If TEFF could sell thousands
    more of Lexicon or Trinite by lowering the price, it would make sense to do so.
    &#40;Of course I don&#39;t actually know the &#39;price elasticity,&#39; as the
    economists put it, for these typefaces.&#41; For &#39;Luxury,&#39; as a display
    face with a wonderful but very limited appeal, you&#39;re not going to sell thousands
    anyway. <BR> <BR>The rational basis for pricing is not the work that goes into
    it, but what will gross the most for the product given the market. Of course that
    might influence your willingness to do the work in the first place... '

    of how expensive it is for its exclusivity as an advertising display face &#40;which
    ironically would make it inexclusive in the long run!&#41;. More people are willing
    to pay for display faces but not &#39;invisible&#39; text faces. Lexicon is a
    great typeface, but how many &#40;graphic&#41; designers know or even care about

    tag doesn&#39;t guarantee exclusivity. <BR> <BR>I think the pricing puts Luxury
    in a kind of no man&#39;s land. You can&#39;t afford to buy it for a one-time
    use. But it&#39;s not the kind of face you&#39;d use over and over again. You
    should&#39;nt want to anyway. <BR> <BR>And clients who can afford it will think
    twice about spending so much on a retail face. They might even be willing to pay
    slightly more to get a customised face.  <BR> <BR>Btw, does anyone have any idea
    how much a customised face would cost? The LTA one by <a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de/"

    the note in PMN&#39;s elegant hand was great! The Lexicon example was a newspaper
    in Dutch, which makes it hard for me to judge. The Lexicon seemed to me too black,
    but I might have a different opinion if I could read it.  <BR> <BR>Trinite has
    so many versions &#40;three different extender heights, two widths, et al.&#41;,
    that it would really take more settings of the different sizes to get a concept.
    The text setting I was sent - a setting in the tallest and widest version - was
    beautiful, but this is probably not the most practical size for book text. A lengthy
    PDF with different settings of the variations in a language I could read would
    be of great help in judging. But honestly, the price is prohibitive in any case.    <BR>
    <BR>Given what you and Hrant say about the scarcity of their stuff here, I wonder

    font family licenses for $400 each, why would you consider this bad marketing,
    especially if the service overhead for each license is the same? Given the extent
    of font piracy in the larger market, there is something to be said for high prices
    and a limited market: among other things, you can be pretty certain that TEFF
    has a very different relationship with its customers than Adobe has. Likewise
    Gerard Unger, and also some American type designers such as Sumner Stone. Interesting
    to note that Sumner used to work for Adobe, so he knows both sides of the font
    pricing question. If you buy a font from the Stone Foundry, you not only pay a
    lot more than you would for an Adobe font, you also have to <i>sign</i> a license
    contract. Such things reinforce the value of what is being purchased. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t think either approach is <i>bad</i> marketing. They are different approaches
    to different markets. There are people who are willing to pay a premium for quality
    fonts and who understand that one of the things they are paying for is relative
    exclusivity: they want fonts that not every Tom, Dick and Harriet graphic designer
    has on his or her hard drive. <BR> <BR>Are you saying that it is bad marketing
    for Emiglio Zegna to price their clothes so that the Walmart shoppers can&#39;t
    afford them? <BR> <BR>And how do you measure the success of a small foundry like
    TEFF? Peter Matthias and his colleagues feed, clothe and house themselves and
    their families. Is it also necessary for a small foundry to become a big foundry?
    Or to enslave itself to shareholders and the constant drive for higher and higher
    profits?'

    difference? &#40;I am talking about the ALDO logo not the flash animation, which
    I guess has some light Helvetica.&#41;  <BR> <BR>John, I agree that both approaches
    can make sense, or not. It just depends on the market - or, to use economists
    language, on the price elasticity for the good in question.   <BR> <BR>I also
    can easily believe an alternative theory: that the TEFF and DTL people make their
    livelihood mainly from teaching and commissioned work, and that the foundries
    are sidelines. And that they are too busy with other stuff to market properly.  <BR>
    <BR>&#40;Evidence: DTL has been promising that van Krimpen&#39;s Romulus, which
    I adore, would be out in three months, for about three years. The current &#39;deadline&#39;
    is August 2003; it has been changed four times, I think. They are also selling
    FontMaster, which seems to be a higher priority.&#41; <BR> <BR>Being an abominable
    marketer myself, I would be the last to say this weakness puts the good folks
    at these places in a bad light.  <BR> <BR>You may be right that they are following
    an optimal path for marketing. But I tend to believe my eyes. I don&#39;t see
    their faces here, and the work is great stuff, according to many on these boards,
    as well as amateur me. To me that raises a real question mark.  <BR> <BR>As to
    Hrant&#39;s reasonable question why they should succeed there and not here: it
    is different selling to their countrymen, who will buy out of friendship and national
    loyalty in a small country.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m definitely not saying I know better.
    And I learned from a similar discussion on Typographica that eg. different car
    models price for different niches. But I am saying that the evidence makes me
    question whether charging ten times more really is an economic benefit to them.  <BR>
    <BR>In this thread people are questioning Christian Schwartz&#39;s decision on
    &#39;Luxury&#39;, and defending DTL and TEFF. My intuition is that it is the other
    way around. I&#39;ve been wrong before, lots, but I notice that sometimes when
    that little bell goes off sometimes I&#39;m right too.'

    that&#39;s the joke. The Luxury Collection is our attempt to comment on the fact
    that the multitude of high-fashion logos can be boiled down into three fonts.
    &#34;fashionable&#34; things look a very specific way, and consumers allow them
    to be priced accordingly. we were hoping the ridiculous price would clue people
    in on the fact that the set is a joke. &#40;the thought of someone paying $1500
    for these three fonts, now that&#39;s funny!&#41;  <BR> <BR>is there a place for
    social commentary and satire in type design? is the idea of a type family as conceptual
    art too much of a stretch? or is the problem that we were too straight-faced with
    our execution? because in this case, i think the attitude IS the function. <BR>
    <BR>in any case, we were planning for this set to be more of a publicity stunt
    than a product that sold a whole lot of copies. and it looks like that part, at

    go bad. Sometimes they even start out bad and 20 years later people suddenly start
    salivating over it. <BR>4&#41; Stop feeling so puzzled, and give TEFF and DTL
    the benefit of the doubt of knowing their markets. <BR> <BR>As for differences
    between The Netherlands and the US, the former does have much stronger restrictions
    on reproduction &#40;like you&#39;re not allowed to even scan a font specimen&#41;,
    but licensing is basically the same, I think. However, the Dutch are simply prepared
    to pay more for fonts, while over here people pay would rather pay more for Hummers.
