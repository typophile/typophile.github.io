  carlovingian minuscule. The first underlined lygature that seems to be \"o\", part
  of \"r\" and what I beleave to be \"z\". This \"z\" is also on the third line but
  letter \"t\" would make more sence here (sententiae). I would be grateful for any
  ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6332.jpg]"

    sorry that I can\u2019t contribute anything to the rest, but you have to be aware
    of the fact that abbreviations were very common in medieval handwriting. (So,
    context \u2013 and source \u2013 always is important here.)"

  body: "Thanks a lot. Wikipedia says:\r\n\r\nThis character form also played a part
    in a common scribal abbreviation. The tail was extended to the right and a cross-bar
    was put through it, producing a figure very much like the ancient Greek symbol
    for the planet Jupiter. This stood for the Latin syllable ram as well as the genitive
    plural terminations, \u2014orum and \u2014arum.\r\n\r\nSo the firs word is \"eorum\".
    Thanks again."
