  me identify 2 typefaces used in the NYC subways in the 1930s/40s in the attached
  Walker Evan's pictures: \r\n\r\n1. the stencil-looking one used for \"7th Ave. Local,\"
  \"South Ferry,\" \"145th St. Lenox Ave.\", etc.\r\n\r\n2. The one used for \"City
  Hall\" in the second \"Hunts Point\" photo. \r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nBest,
  \r\n\r\nBobby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/walker-evans-subway-portraits_6698.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/hunts_pt_6737.jpg]"
