  magazine cover. I've hunted around but haven't found it. Perhaps one of you font
  gurus know? Would appreciate any assistance.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/70s_mystery_font_3591.jpg]"

  body: Wow, that doesn't look '70s at all. Looks like something made this year by
    a hobbiest in Illustrator. The first thing that comes to mind (especially with
    that wacky 'T') is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/pasadena_light/">Pasadena</a>.
