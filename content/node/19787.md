body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI need a font for a logo and so far, I think that the text will
  be all uppercase.\r\n\r\nSo I came across a very nice font for this purpose, called
  <strong>Medina</strong> (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cubanica/medina-gothic/bold/).
  What irritates me are these ink traps, especially in M, N and V. It doesn't look
  right to me.\r\n\r\nI still prefer Medina to all the similar fonts I found. But
  maybe you know some alternatives that I missed.\r\n\r\nAnd if I chose so, where
  should I buy it? (I never bought a font before.)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMax"

  body: Medina looks like it has kerning issues - better pay attention to that.
