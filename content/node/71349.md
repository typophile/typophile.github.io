    it won't be done, and I'll probably never even have an iPad, but I'd like to see
    it done anyway. :P I do sometimes dream of a time when I can roam from place to
    place with a device with very long autonomy that allows me to draw type wherever
    I go\u2026 aah, the freedom.\r\n\r\nBut using fingers only is not a good option
    for that, either; I'd like a stylus."

    to draw rather complex paths.'
