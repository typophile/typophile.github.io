  body: That&#39;s handwritten. All the zeros are different. If I had more <BR>time
    I&#39;d get you some similar fonts, but I&#39;m sure someone <BR>will get on it.

  body: There are about 300 handlettering fonts that were originally part of a ClickArts
    Handwritten Fonts set. I have samples of them all shown in the Script Font ID
    Guide. Most are in Part 11 starting at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html</a>. Since that CD
    is out of print, it&#39;s handy to know that good ol&#39; WSI copied and renamed
    all these fonts and sold them to third party vendors. I built an Alias List that
    equates all of these to their original ClickArt names, which are the names used
    in the Script Guide. The Alias List is at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/HWFontAliases.html"
    target="_blank">http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/HWFontAliases.html</a>.
    Then &#40;last step&#41; you go to this site &#40;<a href="http://iquebec.ifrance.com/jeannine/6fontpolice.htm"
    target="_blank">http://iquebec.ifrance.com/jeannine/6fontpolice.htm</a>&#41; and
    download the font for free.

  body: I&#39;d go for <a href="http://www.blambot.com/dialogue.html" target="_blank">
    comic book lettering</a> if I were you.  <BR>And best of all, they&#39;re free!
    Just my two cents.
