    have credits/colophon on the site. Links to those and other info are at the bottom

      i am on a mac G5, OSX, using IE5... also of note, the 2nd column headed, \"Join
      us at...\" is falling too far to the right. in other words, it isn't centered
      in your red column rules, but breaks out on the right, which i don't think is
      intended...\r\n\r\ni also read your article in the NYTimes today, thanks for
      that!"
