  body: "Why don't you buy the original. Eidetic is a beautiful typeface. If you don't
    need all the extra features in the OTF version. The regular OT goes for $159 which
    is a really good price. \r\n\r\nSome similar (but I doubt cheaper) alternatives
    could be found here;\r\nhttp://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneopro.html\r\nCheers"
