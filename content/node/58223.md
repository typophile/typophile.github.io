body: "Howdy, I've got two styles of catchwords in my font and was wondering what
  feature (or combination thereof) to put them in.\r\n\r\nOrnaments, Stylistic Set
  or Titling Alternates seem to make the most sense with titl having the broadest
  support.\r\n\r\nHowever the only way to get them to work in photoshop is via dlig
  or salt. Is there a problem with having the functionality in both titl and salt?\r\n\r\nThinking
  of something like:\r\n\r\ntitl\r\n- - - \r\nsub A N D by AND.catch;\r\nsub A n d
  by AND.catch;\r\nsub a n d by AND.catch;\r\nsub ampersand by AND.catch;\r\n\r\nsalt\r\n-
  - -\r\nsub AND.catch by AND.catch.alt;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/catch22_5418.gif]"

    is not directly preceded or followed by another letter, otherwise you'll get the
    substitutions happening in words like \u2018m<em>and</em>ible\u2019.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think there is a problem with implementing the same substitution in more
    than one feature so long as there is a reasonable interpretation of the purpose
    of the features. I would be inclined to use dlig rather than salt, though."

  body: "John,\r\nHow would you insure that the substitutions only take place where
    a space breaks the string. Would you change the code to:\r\n\r\nsub A n d [space
    period comma] by AND.catch;\r\n\r\nbut then you would delete the space? Is there
    a word end and begin code? It seems there must be for Arabic where different forms
    exist in different parts of a word?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Chris, I'd attack the problem as John suggests, from the other way. Make
    am OT Class @lettersonly, and ignore sub when this is adjacent to the target string.
    That way \"mANDible\" is ignored, whilst \"'The...'\" would be.\r\n\r\nignore
    sub @lettersonly A N D ;\r\nignore sub A N D @lettersonly ;\r\nsub A N D by AND.catch;\r\n\r\n-
    - - \r\nWhoops, that didn't work. Not sure how to ignore a string of letters:\r\nignore
    sub @lettersonly A' N' D';\r\n\r\nHelp?\r\n\r\nInteresting John, dlig for everything?
    I also have s and c dligs. Seems weird to have catchwords in their too?"

    to use the Adobe-compatible glyph naming syntax (which in this case would be \"A_N_D.catch\").

  body: Thanks Adam. I'm guessing the benefit is that adobe apps recognize these glyphs
    as ligs in some special way?

  body: "Yes, if you name your glyph A_N_D.catch then Acrobat will be able to find
    the glyph in a PDF* if the user searches for the text \"AND\". If you use a name
    AND.catch, then Acrobat will \"think\" that it is just an unknown glyph. \r\n\r\nI
    recommend reading the Glyph Naming and Encoding chapter of the FontLab Studio
    5 user's manual. \r\n\r\n*) This only applies to some PDFs, depending on the way
    they were created. In some scenarios, Acrobat will still find AND.catch, but the
    name A_N_D.catch is safer and works in more occasions. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
