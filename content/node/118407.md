  been able to fine one: what character or symbol should I use for \u201Cx\u201D in
  the expression \u201C9x5\u201D? As in, \u201CUse a 9x5 inch loaf pan for this recipe\u201D
  or \u201CThat table measures 36x72 inches.\u201D\r\n\r\nI\u2019m stumped. I hope
  you can help."

    I\u2019ve been doing. I wondered if there was a specific character for that function."

  body: I suspect that few people would notice if you used an ordinary x, but when
    I've worked with copywriters they specified the  multiplication sign for that
    usage.

  body: I would suspect that a lower case x is also in common usage as well as James
    points out.

  body: Notice that  9x5 and 9&times;5 are most likely spaced differently; there was
    no space typed before or after the multiplication symbol &times;,  it is the font
    Georgia that does the job.

  body: Some copywriters I've worked with requested no spaces on either side of the
    multiplication sign, so maybe that accounts of the difference in spacing you mentioned.
    (But I think some space makes it more readable.)

  body: "Well, of course spacing will be different in setting a math formula compared
    to running text or tabular data.\r\nFor running (and tabular) text I think spacing
    should be related to that used for %, for en-dashes used for ranges, and, of course
    for + and \u2212 signs.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you need to use a |x|, at least set it
    in a sans serif typeface!"
