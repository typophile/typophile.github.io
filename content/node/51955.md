body: "I am setting up a font that I hope will look somewhat hand written when set.
  I have a stylistic alternate for every glyph with just slight changes in hand variance
  and attitude. \r\n\r\nI would like to set up an OT feature where whenever two of
  the same glyphs are repeated side by side, the second glyph switches to the alternate.\r\n\r\nI
  have page 868 of the FontLab manual open. But it is not making a lot of sense to
  me right now.\r\n\r\nFirst, what would I call this feature in the OT window?\r\n\r\nWould
  the code look something like this?:\r\n\r\nSub e e\u2019 by e.alt;\r\n\r\nAnd then
  set that up for every glyph. Or am I confused?\r\n\r\nAnd then, how would that feature
  be turned on and off in the app?\r\n\r\nI have it set up to where I can switch out
  the alternates by hand, but other users will be lazier than me and I would love
  to see some kind of automatic feature.\r\n\r\nAs long as my head doesn\u2019t explode
  trying to code it\u2026\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes that's it, You have it right.\r\n\r\nThere is also a alternate way of
    doing it with very large sets of substitutions and that is with classes.\r\n\r\nBasically
    you just drag and drop all the sets into classes and as long as they are in the
    correct order and size the code would be as follows:\r\n\r\nfeature calt { # Or
    whatever feature you choose.\r\n  sub @letter @letter2' by @letter3 ;\r\n\r\n}
    calt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you would make open type classes and drag all the first
    letters into one called \r\nletter into it and make a new open type class called
    letter2 and drag all the second letters into it and then make a third class called
    letter3 and drag in all the replacement glyphs into that.\r\n\r\nNow that is not
    exactly correct but I'm pretty sure Fontlab will change and compile it correctly
    when you make the font. It will run in the open type preview correctly inside
    Fontlab as written just fine for debugging.\r\n\r\nIf you do it your way I'm pretty
    sure Fontlab will make it sort of like my way on compiling the font. It will try
    to add them all to classes to make the code much smaller. You just have to make
    sure they are all in the correct order and that all three classes have the same
    exact amount of glyphs. It will not compile and give you a warning if that is
    not the case.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I just finished a font like this. I used three of every glyph in the font
    (including punctuation, spaces, nonbreaking spaces, and soft hyphens) in three
    classes; default, alt1, and alt2. My code (<a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?50@755.561rfSM0Gas.1@.3bbc5ea4\">based
    on older code by Tom Phinney and others</a>) is:\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\nlookup
    rotate {\r\n  sub @default @default' by @alt1;\r\n  sub @alt1 @default' by @alt2;\r\n}
    rotate;\r\nlookup rotate;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nTo make it work in Indesign one has
    to use CALT (contextual alternates), because Indesign does not support SALT (<a
    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform\">complain
    about that here</a>).\r\n\r\nYou also need to set up kerning classes to control
    interaction between the different character sets (unless all of the characters
    vary enough to require manual kerning of everything). I recommend that you set
    up all of the classes in a text editor, proof them, and then import them. Otherwise
    you\u2019ll have to find your mistakes by looking at the errors the Opentype compiler
    generates, which can be a PITA because errors fonts with large classes can cause
    the compiler to mangle the classes."
