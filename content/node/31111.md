  This is not the functional site, but a simple machines forum on which to brainstorm,
  assess goals and then decide how to implement them. It is open to all. I would love
  to see everybody who is interested in a web-based font newsmagazine. Those that
  like the idea, come on over, check the manifesto and join in debate. If you think
  the idea is awful, then stay here and discuss! :)\r\n\r\nI'm going to go watch House.
  I'll check in for any questions later over there."

  body: "Today on the Typosium Channel, alongside our running debates of technology,
    community and philosophy, we are at the beginning of a contemplation of review
    standards for Decorative, Display and Passage typefaces. Or if there can even
    be one unified rating for them, or if it would even be beneficial to the users.\r\n\r\nI
    imagine some of the community has very strong opinions on this, and look forward
    to hearing them."
