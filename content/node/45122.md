  of the Original 15th C Subiaco type as distinguished from the revival (UK) Ashendene
  version. These image come from Cicero &amp; St. Augustine (pre 1465 &amp; 1467)
  in reproduction ( hence the dots ) taken of the Book &quot;The Ashendene Press&quot;
  by Colin Franklin. This is a marvelous book in many many ways. Highly recommended.\r\n\r\nWhat
  is interesting about these images is that they show plenty of contextual alternates
  being used, and they are very very obvious. Just to get started have a look at the
  &quot;ra&quot; and &quot;ta&quot; and then look at an &quot;a&quot; in another context.\r\n\r\nThese
  special sorts stopped being used eventually and the standard a became the one used
  in the &quot;ra&quot; combination with the top pulled way back - a decidedly less
  good looking if more practical arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Subiaco_5002.jpg]"

    or expansion!

  body: Yes, "a" is malleable. In terms of saving space perhaps no more than other
    glyphs. But it terms of fitting with other glyphs without loss of it's own "ID"
    unusually so.
