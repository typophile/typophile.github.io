  font name.  As expected, she kindly told me that she doesn't reveal her font sources
  so here I am... :-)  I have tried the font identifier sites and although one got
  close (said it was FF Elementa) it's actually not the same.  Biggest difference
  I can tell is with the number 1.  \r\n\r\nAny way, any help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nI've
  tried to attach an image, but if it doesn't work below is a link to a sample.\r\n\r\n[[http://ny-image0.etsy.com/il_fullxfull.179047984.jpg]]"
