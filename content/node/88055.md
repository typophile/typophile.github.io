  body: "No one writes labels anymore, they use a handwriting font.\r\nAnd who has
    a typewriter?\r\nBut the Hill Station label isn\u2019t a poor fake.\r\nThis branding
    signifies upscale short-run \u201Chome-made\u201D quality, not big factory, by
    referencing low-tech type/lettering on a plain label. The pretense doesn\u2019t
    matter, to the extent that the repetitive glyphs and regularity of leading and
    flush left aren\u2019t even a problem. The intent is to signify a product\u2019s
    position in the marketplace, not to deceive the shopper with a trompe-l\u2019\u0153il
    effect.\r\n\r\nCompare with a similar idea, photographed in a Paris market in
    1973. In those days, it would have been quite acceptable for the <em>maman</em>
    who lovingly made the beautiful preserve to have also lovingly made a label with
    beautiful writing.\r\n\r\nBut today, if one were to take the Hill Station label
    at face value, it appears that the writing was done by a six-year old who has
    yet to master cursive and capitals, or an adult who has regressed to that level.
    \r\n\r\nWhat is it about something so crude and na\xEFve that you find good and
    beautiful?\r\n\r\nWould the Hill Station labels have been spoiled if they looked
    less like a typeface, and more like real writing, having been done with an OpenType
    font that utilized contextual alternates to do away with obvious glyph repetitions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG0013_5843.jpg]"

    is it?\r\nWould a font with contextual alternates (to avoid, for instance, the
    two \u201Ce\u201Ds in \u201Csweet\u201D being identical) have been more erudite\u2014demonstrating
    that the designer had made a study of contemporary script fonts, and was familiar

    of the type and layout more appropriate than trying to deceive the shopper into

    some fonts accordingly."

    I'm very curious about the suggestions of Nick!!! :)\r\nyes, your opinion Nick
    it's a great point of view, your are right about the contextual alternates, totally,
    but I can't believe that the people think that those handwriting fonts are made
    trully by hand...I think that everybody can understand that they are typesetting!!!
    or not?!?!\r\nso what you suggest???\r\n\r\nbut please, the next time be less

    interests me.\r\n\r\n<em>I think that everybody can understand that they are typesetting!!!</em>\r\n\r\nI
    don't think that thought (\"is it type or writing?\") occurs to most people, even
    designers.\r\nI have trained myself to spot the difference by looking for repeated
    glyphs, because I'm very much involved with the process of making OpenType fonts
    that mimic handwriting. But that's unusual.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I do think that
    the overall effect of the Hill Station labels is typographic, rather than lettering\u2014not
    just the font, but, as I mentioned, the setting, which is flush left and evenly
    leaded.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the viewer may or may not be aware of, be they shoppers,
    designers, typographers or type designers, I do think it's important that you,
    Swan, have a clear strategy vis-\xE0-vis whether you want to create an effect
    which is typographic, lettering, or type that imitates lettering. \r\n\r\nOr do
    you just want a fashionable script font?"

  body: "ok guys (sorry for the late of my answer, I miss you a little bit :) )\r\nhere
    I am, it's impossible to obtain a complete hand made label in the real market,
    cause there are too many informations that you are forced to put on them and sometimes
    the law decide also how big some informations must be. almast for all the cosmetics
    and drinks and foods. so it's impossible to produce a minimal label like Karey's
    one.\r\nhowever, yes, probably I can't understand all the stylistic undertones
    that there are between typographic, lettering, or type that imitates lettering
    or a fashionable script font!!! and I would like to learn it, to clarify my mind
    and bringh the right decision.\r\n\r\n@T\xE9 Rowan: I love Sudtipos fonts, but
    the other one is complete out of my idea...I don't want some old handwritings.\r\n\r\nthanks

    instance, if something like the Hill Station label could be set with a script
    font that has contextual alternates, it would be possible to set the label two
    ways, once with the Contextual Alternates feature applied, and once with it off.
    At the same time, you could humanize the \u201Con\u201D version further by varying
    the indent of each line, and the leading. You might even add bounce by manually
    adjusting baseline shift. And apply manual kerning for a more uneven fit.\r\n\r\nThen
    you can compare the \u201Ctypographic\u201D version with the more artful mimicry
    of handwriting, and see which works best for the design brief.\r\n\r\n(It would
    also be possible to apply de-regularizing typographic effects to a non-script
    font, and even throw glyph rotation into the mix; this would produce a pointedly
    arty, non-professional, hand-made effect.)"
