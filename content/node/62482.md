  44 polytonic glyphs.\r\n\r\nIt means you added the numeral signs\r\n<dl>0374;\u0374;GREEK
  NUMERAL SIGN\r\n0375;\u0375;GREEK LOWER NUMERAL SIGN</dl>\r\n\r\nthen thus it makes
  the characters not displayable in Scribus.\r\n\r\nCharacters (\u1F04 \u1F00 \u1F70
  \u1F10 \u1F72 \u1F31 \u1F76 \u1F36 \u1FD6 \u1F21 \u1F22 \u1F74 \u1F78 \u1F45 \u1F50
  \u1FF6) are red, making the characters to show as rectangles."

    Korean is that much better than 386sky's English, you might have answered him
    in Korean.\r\n\r\n@386sky: Bitstream Cyberbit is not available for free any more.
    \r\nThere is a successor Titus Cyberscript: http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/unicode/tituut.asp.\r\n\r\nYour
    problem description is not quite clear. \r\nHave you added glyphs to that font?\r\nHave
    you added 44 glyphs or just the two you mention?\r\n\r\nYou do not describe how
    you did that. \r\nWhat program did you use? What exactly did you do?\r\n\r\nIt
    seems the encoding of the font got messed up. Maybe this can help you:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_numerals#Ancient_Greek_numerals\r\n\r\nAndreas"
