  body: looks like a right old mixture to me... the numbers are bureau grotesque,
    the r has an antique olive flavour...

  body: you're right, there is a nice balance to everything, although the 't' jars
    somewhat

  body: "I was looking at some old Photo-Lettering Catalogs, where I think they call
    this style 'obround'(notice the oblong counter of the 'o'). Many of those types
    had a tailed 't', but some had tail-less alternate characters, so that suggests
    that this is consistent with a 60's - 70's advertising look. It was the 'r' that
    seemed harder to match, and I don't think I saw anything identical to this sample
    -- not too surprising, considering that the samples in these books are just a
    few words, and not alphabet showings in most cases.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: The skeleton reminds me of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atwesterveldt/atwesterveldt/">Westerveldt</a>,
    but I can't find any more iterations beyond this one.
