  logo below, but the first step is identifying it. The one I'm looking for is similar
  but with flourishes on crossbars, terminals and tails.\r\n<img src=\"http://elizabethwhelandesign.com/uploads/news/11/FastCompany_logo_74x500.jpg\"

  body: "Can't imagine what you mean by \"flourishes\" but here is a detailed image
    which seems to be a variation of the lettering in the logo\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FastCompany3pos_4410.jpg]\r\nThere
    are some differences, particularly in the lack of spurs and the angle of the terminals
    in _S_ but the serif treatment seems similar to the wordmark as used in the magazine\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FastCompany2a_6254.jpg]\r\nDon"
