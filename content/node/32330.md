body: "Just wanted to waste some time and was wondering what got all of you started
  with typography and or Graphic Design. \r\n\r\nI've always been a doodler but never
  pursued art in my education. I studied Journalism and Communication at the University
  of Arizona and was fed up with life. It came down to some unknown calling to do
  one of the following. Join the Army (almost signed my life away) or find an art
  school. Can't say why I wanted to, I didn't have the foggiest idea about typography
  or design. Yet I found myself moving back to the Bay Area and pursuing just that.
  Still to this day don't know what made me want to do it, but now I can officially
  call myself a Typophile (amonsgt other things . . . not ending in 'phile' though).
  \r\n\r\nI love to hate it, im almost done with this degree but I have never felt
  further away from  the end goal. But I am grateful for Typophile as I can now rant,
  rave, and post about stuff not to many other people notice or care about.\r\n\r\nAnyway
  I would love to hear how everyone else delved into this realm of passion and pain.
  . . \r\n\r\nCheers (Slainte)\r\n\r\n~James"

    Art in the Art Deco Style</a> by Theodore Menten out of my secondary school library.
    I think that was in 1975, and it's been that way ever since.

      entirely and going back to art school.  Im eyeballing Web design, or interior
      design.  I feel I am getting too old (34) to wait to go back to school but I
      dont know where to begin.  I have an associates in science of all things!  I
      live in RI and am looking at RISD certificate programs, or a college/state school
      with a media program- Im not sure which way to go  :(

    But where I grew up encouraging kids to do anything creative with their lives
    was verboten, so I ended up working in IT until I was 25, at which point I quit
    my job and went to art school hoping to study digital illustration and 3D animation.
    Neither of those went anywhere, but I was really digging page layout, and once
    I'd had a really great typography class I was hooked. \r\n\r\nNow I just need
    to wrap up the degree and get back to work!"

    about a year ago it's pull was too strong & I was drawn into it nearly full time.

    seriously encouraged to do so by my godmother, who watched me while my mom was
    working. She always had paper and crayons ready for me- it was the one thing guaranteed
    to keep me out of trouble.\r\n\r\nAs far as typography goes, I've always paid
    attention to it, especially how certain faces and the manner in which they were
    used made me feel a certain way, just like colors would.\r\n\r\nAt college I had
    a prof who taught me no matter what area of design you pursue, always make your
    type look good.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "James\r\nI think what prompted me to pursue typography in a serious way was
    printing letterpress books and setting the type by hand. The process, from beginning
    to end, from setting the type to printing the words, is, well, kind of magic.
    At some point in the process the shapes of the letters suddenly took on great
    importance and I asked myself why - why do the letters look the way they do and
    how is it that these little pieces of lead in printed form can look so very beautiful
    on the printed page. I knew somehow that Spectrum, Romulus, Romanee, Joanna, Gill
    Sans, Goudy Thirty were great designs but I'm still asking myself the question
    why. The more you look at the letters and their structure the more you come to
    understand the wonder of it all, the 26 letters. It's Magic man!\r\nSl\xE1inte

  body: ok here goes. i really wanted to be an art student, but my father suggested
    i will learn something to live from, then study art. i did as he advised to me,
    and i don't regret it ever since. typography was a sweet revelation to me, and
    in the future i hope to incorporate type and design in art.

  body: "When I was 14, I started working on the layout team of a Boy Scout newsletter.
    I don't think that there was that much that was special about our design or layouts,
    but through the right active leaders, we got to use high-end pre-press tools that
    we probably never should have gotten our hands on\u2026\r\n\r\nWell, that got
    me hooked on the Mac, PageMaker, Photoshop, and eventually, Quark. I started developing
    black and white photos, and then figured that I should go to art school and study
    graphic design. This was actually a bit of a leap if you were to see the stuff
    I was trying (poorly) to do in high school, but I ended up at RISD and that was
    great.\r\n\r\nI moved to Germany at the end of college, because I (na\xEFvely?)
    thought that I would be moving somewhere whose culture was more typographically
    sophisticated than the United States of America's. I saw old letters everywhere,
    and knew that I could not be happy unless I began drawing type."

  body: "I got into typography in highschool. I am only 19 now, so that really wasn't
    long ago. But I was doing ok at school but nothing was taking my interest, then
    i studied visual communications and studio design in year 10, 11 and 12 (last
    3 years of high school in Australia)...and immediately loved it. Typography didn't
    spring up though until i went along to a design conference in Melbourne (AGIDEAS)
    and listened to Ahn Sang Soo and David Pidgeon give their presentations. From
    that point on I have loved typography, this inspired me to design some basic typefaces
    of my own in my last year of high school and now studying Communication Design
    at uni, which has a strong emphasis on typography. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick "

  body: The first time I remember trying to draw anything like a font was in fifth
    grade when I was about ten years old. Mad magazine used to use a lot of Latin
    Bold and Latin Wide back then (mid-sixties). Those gigantic triangular serifs
    must have gotten my attention and I remember drawing them in my notebooks. That's
    probably when I started drawing letters.
