  body: I think there&#39;s a faux italic effect applied to your sample. Have you
    considered <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/changeling/bold/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Changeling</a> by Mark Simonson? It&#39;s very close and may suit
    your needs perfectly.

    <BR>There was a VGC display font from the 1970s called China. I don&#39;t know
    of any authorized digitizations, but there is a version called Camp Caps which
    seems to be the one that most people are using when you see this font. It&#39;s
    not a very good digitization &#40;some of the characters are badly distorted&#41;.
    It&#39;s easy to identify by the squashed 2 and some other earmarks. <BR> <BR>Changeling
    is my redesign/remix/expansion of China.

  body: I think Eyechart Display caps from Southern Software is also similar but another
    poor digitization, so I suggested Changeling mostly because I think its a better
    font.

  body: Changeling all the way baby - sometimes I really don&#39;t think  <BR>we need
    to point people to the actual digitization if it&#39;s poor  <BR>and there&#39;s
    an almost identical and superior alternative  <BR>available. I suppose most people
    who ask for an ID want to  <BR><i>use</i> the friggin&#39; font. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"

  body: This is also an example of what happens when people manually condense or expand
    fonts rather than looking for a font that already has the proportions they seek.
    One of the unfortunate byproducts of the fact that any idiot with a computer can
    set their own type nowadays rather than working with a pro.
