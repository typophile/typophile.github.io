  It's from the cover of Joy Division's Closer album, designed by Peter Saville.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joy_5745.png]\r\n\r\nI
  cleaned it up and wrangled it so many times to get something out of Identifont that
  I'm going crazy.\r\n\r\nI thought I had a good answer when I found a typeface labeled
  \"Joy Division Closer\" at Saville's site, but it's a forgery! (Omigod, someone
  alert Uli!) They dumped a typeface named Helios SSi onto the site. Changed the name,
  but didn't bother to change the copyright. To make it worse, it's not even the same
  typeface. Bla."

  body: i loved that album cover too... I wouldn't be surprised if the lettering was
    hand-drawn, then 'cut-and-pasted' into place, much like I used to do with headlines
    around that time

  body: "The album has every letter in it but K, Q, and Z, so that would have been
    quite a lot of work for a then unknown and poorly paid Peter Saville, I should
    think. Factory Records didn't have a ton of money to be throwing around for custom
    lettering jobs.\r\n\r\nHere's a larger version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joy2_4046.png]"

    Saville was even on Typeradio, so the type gods would have busted him with bad
    karma had it been his actions.\r\n\r\nYAY! Trajan!"

  body: "Trajan? Blah. I thinks it's closer to Friz Quadrata than anything. And like
    I might have implied, I don't think it's hand lettered. The entire cover, back,
    and insides have the same typeface at completely different sizes, sans 3 letters.\r\n\r\nWhat
    type catalogs would Saville had available in the UK around 1979-1980?"

    that I found before, but that ain't it. Sorry Yves. Can you fix it again?
