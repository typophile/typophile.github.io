body: "<strong>obsolete, just see second post. There is a system update solving this
  issue</strong>\r\n\r\nJust to warn everybody, after I had a lot of troubles with
  this and deleting the font cache innumerable times, which did not make the bug disappear,
  I want to share this. Mac OS 10.6.7 has problems with OpenType PostScript fonts.
  It will print them with errors and produce broken PDFs no matter if the internal
  PDF function is used or if Adobe Acrobat is used. These PDFs are broken forever.

  there are two workarounds here. One can reinstall the system and install the 10.6.6
  combo update from the apple support website. OR There is a work-around, to install
  some parts of 10.6.6 upadte onto the 10.6.7. This is mentioned here: http://i.tuaw.com/2011/03/28/10-6-7-update-causes-opentype-font-issues/
  direct link: http://azlist.info/kj/downloads/ the link in the bottom of the green
  area. \r\n\r\nI personally experienced  following errors: \r\n- Fonts are replaced
  with bullet signs are not displayed at all.\r\n- Adobe PDF crashes when trying to
  handling the OT PS fonts.\r\n- The PDF with Adobe can be created, but then the print-server
  or the laser printer couldn't handle the PDF and I couldn't print the documents. "
