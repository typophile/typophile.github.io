    body: "Hi Akira1975,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help, I really appreciate
      it. \r\n\r\nYes, it definitely looks like it's based on SangBleu BP Serif Light.
      There doesn't seem like there's a Medium or Bold version, and I am worried that
      this might be a custom. \r\n\r\nAnyone else here have a clue what this might
      be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
