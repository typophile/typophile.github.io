  is a comment that my teacher just made today. His basic premise was that it never
  pays to waste any time on drop caps. They are good for giving your eye an entrance
  into a block of text, but not really that important in the grand scale of things.\r\n\r\nI
  happen to like an elegant looking drop cap. It lends a sense of class to whatever
  you are working on.\r\n\r\nDo you think he is correct? Or is he off the mark?"

  body: IMHO A drop cap can be a great way of starting something off or even of defining
    sections. They can be overdone, but I think you teacher is off the mark.

    to save time? If designers aren't getting paid to do pretty stuff like drop caps
    what exactly are we here for?

    \"saves time\" reasoning is really lame.  Whenever someone says \"always\" do
    this or \"never\" do that (in design circumstances at least) be very leary.  There
    is no simple little checklist to great typography.  It is work. Drop caps or any
    other device can both be used well and poorly. It is like golf. After you select
    the club to use, you still have to make the shot.  Selecting items from menues
    and pallettes in InD is a snap, making the page look good and function well both
    takes work.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    is crucial. Readers depend on visual clues to see where articles begin and end,
    since they're usually scanning fast in different directions. Now, I'm not trying
    to say drop caps are essential, but if they fit the style of the layout and are
    tastefully implemented, they can enhance things. They are a bit like the little
    bullets or icons that end an article. (Is there a name for those things?) They
    give the reader a little cue that says \"I am starting an article\" or \"I just
    finished an article\" -- and the little bit of extra satisfaction that comes with
    it.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound nuts?"

    about four pages.\r\n\r\nJames - the examples you posted are just great... really
    exemplary. Thanks for sharing.\r\n\r\nEither Dan's instructor is unaware of this

    he just seems to think that we should focus on pleasing the 95% of the population
    that could care less about type and typography. Since the drop cap is immediately
    looked past, it stands to reason, for him at least, that you should use your time
    and energy on the parts of your design that will make a lasting impression on
    the common man.\r\n\r\nI dunno. As some of those exmples above show, a good cap
    can leave a very definite impression on someone's mind. "

    capping style is excessive in a purely functional and informational context, and
    that it has no place in say a magazine, newspaper, or website. I was also indoctrinated
    not to use it by my instructors when I was in college. \r\n\r\nMaybe the disdain
    began with Modernist sensibilities. Herbert Bayer and many other typographers
    during this period sought to eliminate capital letters altogether. If that is
    the case, the initial cap would have been the first to be decapitated."

    so many people struggle to rise above the rabble. Even all the crazy communist
    designers of the early twentieth century were trying to create GOOD type for the
    masses, but doing lazy type for the masses is just vile.\r\n\r\nLately I've been
    reading \u201CAtlas Shrugged\u201D and contrasting the villains with people I've
    known who just want to center all the type, set it in Arial, and call it a day.
