  one might be a corporate font. I don't know which one exactly. It is being used
  by Telef\xF3nica for their advertising communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sumate-al-cambio2_4976.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  other seems to be Frutiger. If so, I'm not sure which cut of Frutiger it is.\r\n\r\nI
  would be very happy if you have any suggestion of similar fonts that might work
  as well on screen as these two. Thanks everyone.\r\n"

  body: "The first one is close to <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/priva/|Priva
    One]]</strong>\r\n\r\nThe /g seems a bit different, but it could be due to the
    small size rasterization\r\nI don't know... "

  body: "Yep, that's the one Movistar Text. I love the friendly Fontsmith designs.\r\n\r\nCould
    anybody suggest any other font similar to Movistar text (this one is not for sale).
    There are others like Priva One or even Droid Sans Pro but I would like to try
    a few. It goes without saying that they will be use on screen only.\r\n\r\nThanks
    to all. "
