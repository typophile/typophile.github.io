  body: Are you running it on a <strong>Mac?</strong> If so, how long have you been
    using the printer? Thanks in advance for the info. I'm looking for a small-footprint
    printer for my home office. More black and white need than color these days, too.

    white, but I use it only for looking at the typefaces I design, so color is not
    really needed.\r\n\r\nI think it's OK."

    no complaints. Not sure what other printers are better but to me this one is very
    nice.

    long in the tooth.

  body: "I had two HPs in a row start being fussy about picking up paper after 2 years,
    so I decided to switch to Epson since it doesn't pick it up, but has gravity helping
    feed it.\r\n\r\nAlso since most of my output is for the web, and I rarely print
    anything important, I decided to stop buying expensive printers. I just got an
    R300 for $79 with a coupon about a year ago at Costco. It does a decent job. I
    have to say I'm satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nSomeday when money isn't so tight, I'll
    splurge on a decent one again that prints up to 13\"x19\". I have a bunch of expensive
    oversized paper to use up. But I don't think I'll buy HP again because of the
    pick-up thing."

    i860</a>.  It does beautiful photos and graphics; but, as with most consumer-level
    inkjets, text isn't so great. I have a HP Laserjet 1000 for printing that stuff.\r\n\r\nI
    recently stol--er--adopted an Epson Stylus Photo 1280 (a 13x19 6-color inkjet)
    that I'll hook up eventually.  Besides being able to print on 13x19 paper, the
    1280 supposedly does PostScript when connected to a Mac or PC server running Epson's
    RIP software... so that's something to look forward to... I think? I don't know
    much about PS, so feel free to clue me in about it!"

  body: "For color printing I have the Epson 1280 which I  hate. This is my second
    Epson and both have been huge wastes of money. When I decide to replace this one
    I'll look closely at other brands for inkjet printing. For my first Epson I bought
    a software called PowerRip for postscript, it sucked, the color was terrible.
    At the time Epson didn't have postscript support for this printer (the 1160) I
    haven't researched Epson's Rip software for the 1280.\r\n\r\nFor black and white
    laser I have the Ricoh Aficio  AP610N which I adore. It's fast and the quality
    is great. Can't recommend it enough.\r\n\r\nJohn - pound for pound, pennies for
    pennies I decided on the Ricoh over the Xante (altho I was looking at a different
    model than the 4G) - it had more speed for about $300 less. I suggest you look
    into it. This baby prints 35 ppm."

  body: Patty, I have the Xante AW 1200, which is what I think you are comparing the
    Ricoh to, as it has similar resolution and wide format. It is a wonderful printer,
    but its output still has gain compared to offset printing. So for proofing typefaces,
    I would think that the Xante AW 4G at 2400 dpi would be definitely better. At
    more than four times the price it had better be!

  body: "i have an Epson R800 (A4) and a <a href=\"http://www.photo-i.co.uk/Reviews/interactive/Epson%20R1800/page_1.htm\">R1800
    </a>mostly for doing photography up to A3+. I use Calumet Matt and Gloss photo
    paper, mostly because it's good, not overpriced and doesn't have crap on the back
    of the paper.\r\n\r\nBoth Epson's handle heavy weight watercolour paper. Both
    Epsons print individual CD lables on the CD which is good and I use for low runs
    of CDs for clients.\r\n\r\nFor text I have an HP Laserjet 2200D duplexer which
    is fine. The R series Epson printers use pigment based inks and use 8 printer
    cartriges, red,blue,yellow,mattblack, photoblack,cyan,magenta,glossoptimizer.
    They are pricey to replace at about \xA311-14 each.\r\n\r\nWe tested the R1800
    with type since our local bromide printer stopped doing bromides. We had trouble
    matching my test on my home print done from Windows (which were excellent) to
    a Mac printed on a work R1800. The mac drivers are not as clear as the Windows
    ones so the settings might not be correct. It is very important to get the right
    paper type and colour profile.\r\n\r\n"

    the cd label right onto the cd. Seems like it would be much better than stick
    on ones.

  body: "William - yes, that's the Xante I was talking about. I don't find a lot of
    dot gain on the Ricoh, I think it's pretty crisp actually, but of course 2400
    dpi will give better results. I was just so floored with the value on the Ricoh
    - it's only about $800 which makes it an unbelievably affordable machine for wide
    format, especially compared with the HPs which start at $1500.\r\n\r\nI would
    welcome recommendations for inkjets - especially those compatible with OS X as
    I will eventually need to replace that stupid Epson. "

  body: "@j_polo9.. for the Epson you stick a blank CD label onto a CD, then you put
    it in a special tray that fits into the printer. then you just print. The tray
    with the CD goes into the printer and prints directly onto the CD. Which is fine
    for one CD but it would be better to print directly onto the sheets so you can
    add them when needed such as when you need to send out a CD for someone.\r\n\r\nI
    wasn't impressed by the images, they are all b&w on gold. And I wondered what
    happen to the CD printing does it get etched off? \r\n\r\nthese are some labels
    printed directly on the cd from the Epson\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cd_6286.jpg]"

  body: Canon i9900, 8 colour inkjet, 13x19, great for doing my school work and smaller
    posters and things like that since the quality and colour definition is outstanding,
    plus it is nice to be able to print out spreads in full size for critiques. Not
    great with really fine details for type at text sizes but serves its purpose.
    I use my schools 2400 dpi HP  lasers (wish I remembered the model) when I have
    needed to test output at text sizes etc.
