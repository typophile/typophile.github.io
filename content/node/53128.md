  on called Lundan.  I'm new to typography but I think I've got the basics down and
  I was wondering if anyone had any critique of my uppercase for me?  I don't have
  a Z yet, obviously but it is a WIP.  Any help is much appreciated.  PLEASE BE HARSH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated
  since comments below."

  body: U and W look a bit out of place to me but it would be difficult to give them
    the same bottom right turn that most others have. Having said that C and G seem
    to fit the rhythm. I think what it is is that most of the letters have a slightly
    hand painted look which I like. They could have all been painted with single strokes
    of a wide brush. However the U and W look sharper with more geometric precision.

    would work?\r\n\r\nJared Lunde\r\nhttp://www.jaredlunde.com/"
