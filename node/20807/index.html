  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We print hard copy newsletters and journals that also are posted onto our organization's Web site in PDF format. Pages of the publications are typically in 2- or 3-columns, letter size. A reader tells me that it's disconcerting to read columns of text online. She thinks we ought to design all of our pubs in 1-column. 

Anyone else share this reader's view that online pubs should be 1-column only? And how to coordinate hard copy publications with electronic ones?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, I tried to post a PDF but can't. Sorry but I'm a newbie at this!

The printed page uses a 3-column format--and was designed this way for the print version as text in 1-column across a letter-size page is too difficult to read. But when viewers read it online, it's disconcerting to go down and up again in columns. Does this make sense?

So...is there a way (or have you seen examples) of hard copy pubs that consider this in online versions of the same pubs? Or do you think most readers would simply download the entire PDF and read in hard copy form anyway? 

Thanks again!</div>

Here are my thoughts on this:

It depends on the information you're publishing and how you anticipate readers using it. If you're publishing recipes, yes most will print the pages. If it is a trade journal with news and columns, people will likely only print portions. Since some browers allow PDF's to open directly within, i think many people expect to interact with those documents in the same way they do Web sites: As you've pointed out, people don't want to have to scroll up and down. And why should they?

You may want to consiser publishing the content directly to a Web page, with text in one-column, and just offer the PDF as a "printer-friendly" option.

I believe there may be ways to use CSS to identify the output destination. I think you could have one set of CSS for the printed version, and one for online viewing. This may require designing the documents coded with XHTML. (I have no experience with this, but i've heard it's pretty great when you need to use CSS to specify differing destinations for the content.

If you're working in InDesign, look up info in the HELP section about repurposing content from PDFs. If done well, you could actually create one PDF document that can be optimised for use on the Web, in print and even on a PDA.

Hope this helps.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks all for your advice. Any other Web sites offering info on how the print publishing industry is changing--and how conventional publishers are "printing" only online versions? I am feeling like a dinosaur and am getting worried that my print design and production skills won't be marketable very soon.

Thanks again, everyone!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A quick read is easier when the lines aren't too long, it helps the eye recatch itself when it gets lost in the words. 

For print I try and stay  below 60-70 picas for long copy. 

I think the problem is it's a different story for reading from a monitor. The distance the eye travels and scans words is different than on paper. I suggest going between a single full line and three columns, why no try a two column. You'd better test this one a few times, but only take the advice you received as a problem to fix, and don't listen to the solution unless you weight all the options. I hardly believe a single column is the answer unless the column is a short distance.</div>
