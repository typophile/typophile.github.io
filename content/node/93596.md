body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know of a sans/serif family where the serif has
  taller ascenders/descenders than the sans? I'm considering this option for my own
  font, but I'm afraid it might take away the unity.\r\n\r\nCheers! jasper"

  body: "Good question.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: the difference between varying the
    proportions so the two <em>appear</em> the same, versus look clearly different.
    From your other thread I assume you're looking for the former, although both scenarios
    are worth learning about.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I'm looking for an example of them appearing clearly different, but, as you
    said, both sceneraios are interesting.

  body: "The concept of mixed sans/serif families is fairly new (eg something that
    has started in the last decades). Earlier examples are in the line of what Frutiger
    did: using an existing sans or serif family as a starting point for a variant
    serif or sans. If I recall correctly the block serif Serifa shares a lot of basic
    forms with Univers.\r\nAnother example of this procedure, but maybe more controlled
    is what Martin Majoor did with Scala. He first did the sans and the serif a couple
    of years later. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think you will find a lot of examples. "
