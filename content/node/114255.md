  I don\u2019t entirely understand. Especially the help suggestion is entirely useless.
  I understand the issue is caused by \u201Cmultiple glyphs\u201D with the unicode
  2126, but how do I find, identify and eliminate the duplicate entry if it isn\u2019t

  new app, shows promise, but I can\u2019t justify to dash out another $329. Designing
  fonts is a passion of mine and I understand virtually no one can live from it (except

  body: "\"I love some features of FontLab, but its approach and mysterious ways are

    to modern applications.\"\r\n\r\nI was thinking the exact same thing. I just stumbled
    upon the thread about the progress on FontLab 6, because frankly FontLab Studio
    5 is too confusing. I have a tremendous amount to learn about FontLab still anyway
    so it's not strange I run into problems, but I'm also thinking perhaps it's not
    so wise to invest my time in trying to figure this software out if FontLab 6 is
    on the way. I tried Glyphs but it doesn't quite provide me with what I want. A
    new FontLab is really what I would prefer, but perhaps that's just due to previous
    experience and I need to force myself to learn new software.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I
    apologize for coming to a different thread with my own issues, but I was wondering
    if you guys could help me out with what seems to be a problem which is easy enough
    to fix for someone with more experience with the software and/or scripting. Here's
    the thread explaining my problem: [[http://typophile.com/node/114295]]\r\n\r\nNormally
    I would just wait for someone to respond, but I need to have 2 basic fonts roughly
    done by Friday and I'm afraid to start working on the second font until this issue
    in the first one is solved. I was going to use the metrics and script of the first
    font to develop the second one. I can't generate an OTF file until the problem
    in the script is resolved."

  body: "In the main font window, you can simply search (Cmd/Ctrl-F) for any glyph
    by either name or codepoint. So it should have been easy to find those two particular
    glyphs sharing the one Unicode codepoint. Or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nOf
    course, those of us who routinely work on fonts with 1000+ glyphs use the search
    functions a lot. Also the custom encoding view."

  body: I think I'm the one who's missing something. I have a bunch of missing glyphs,
    which are small-caps. I removed the small-caps class though and the glyphs are
    gone too, so I have no idea why it's still trying to find these glyphs. Do you
    have any idea where to look, or could someone have a look at my file and fix the
    problem?

    they could still be referenced by:\r\n- OpenType feature code\r\n- kerning\r\n-
    class definitions"

  body: When I compile it's referencing a lot of .sc glyphs which aren't there. The
    font I originally started working from had small caps but I don't need any. I
    made sure there is no mention of .sc in the script of the features or the classes.
    Where is the kerning? Isn't that just the kern class defined in the OpenType panel?

  body: "In FontLab, go to windows > panels > classes. Anything there? If there is,
    even though you don't use it now, Font Lab expects it and will give you an error
    message. You can't just whisper your intentions in it's ear, you know. (Well you
    can, but your success rate is going to be <cite>really</cite> low...)\r\n\r\nYou'll
    have to tidy up your classes. Easiest way, as I said in the build forum, is to
    set things so the classes are a part of the features, write off the features to
    a simple text file, and check that everything there is still valid. Next, clear
    both the classes and features in the FontLab file, then read the features back
    in, and compile.\r\n\r\nOr tidy things up in the FontLab (file) itself.\r\n\r\n"

  body: No, I cleaned that panel. I tried removing everything and compiling and it's
    still giving me an error as described. I tried all kinds of cleaning methods,
    from copying everything to Notepad, checking the code and copying everything back
    manually to exporting features and loading them back in. Even worse, I just noticed
    that the latest version of my font has the leading all messed up. Things aren't
    getting better. Does someone have the time and interest to have a look at my font
    and check what I'm doing wrong?
