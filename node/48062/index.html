after reading the last 200 posts in the last 4 hours, I decided to put my logo, which I designed for a friend to your critisism. What is wrong and what is good?

Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/connect_5038.jpg]</div>

The mark and the type don't look like they're one coherent unit. They're spaced too far apart from each other in all of these examples.

What are these logos for? I assume this was designed just for fun as "connect.com" and "direct.com" are already taken.

I agree with clashmore, you'd benefit by starting on paper then using Illustrator. This screenshot is actually Photoshop, but I assume that's not what you used to create the logo, right?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, first, I thought, after 24 hours, to get some 'constructive' critisism. Things like ' I really don't like Serpentine' don't help me - 'Mountain Dew'??? Sorry, doesn't say anything to me, maybe because I am on the other side. Why is Serpentine not right (I think it is a nice 'speedy' font) and which one would be more appropriate??
'They’re spaced too far apart from each other in all of these examples' - that is something to work with. I will change this, but closing in leaves me no choice than to lift the text and get it a little bit between the 'balls', which make it uneven somehow.
'The sentiment behind the concept is very dated and the solution looks obvious - by that i mean I have no confidence that you’ve put much thought into it' - yes, I did research, but it is difficult to come with something brandnew in this segment.
I did the basics in Freehand as it is for me very difficult to sketch on paper. The ideas are in my head. but I can them realise better with a program than with 'bare' hand. My Freehand docs looks like sketches, so... :)
Any other suggestions??

Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When you ask for someones opion, you can expect their opinion.
Sometimes some-ones personal opinion triggers some-one else his.
I wouldn't worry about this.


Since you are working on a logo I would loose the shadows.
Remember that things have to be printed, placed on websites, cars, stationary ...
often
Shadows are a pain then. Beside that, they often don't add anything. It often brings an amateuristic feel with it. It is often a way of adding something interesting.

What is your reason of putting it there?

And, what is your reason to choose for yellow?

I would try and look for an other font. Personaly I do like serpentine, but I hardly ever use it because it feels outdated. It has become a bit cheapy. Exception are outthere.

This together with the logo in front of it, it is not a memorable logo. 

You say you have difficulty in sketching on paper. Often this does open new doors.
Research, look what is out there and not te be missed: what kind of company is it? Translate that into a logo and I think the one you have now doesn't suit anymore.

Hope this helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">:)) That's more like what I expected.

To Bobby:
About the font: ok, I am a little bit short at fonts, and there is no way I purchase them for 150$ or more just for demonstration. So, I have to go with what I have. Sure, I like fonts like Futura, Helvetica, Frutiger, Garamond, and so on, but most of the times my clientel doesn't like them as they are too 'simple' (that's what customer say - I prefer 'timeless'). So they want something out of the row. Maybe you have some suggestions for fonts I could use or would be more appropiate.
About the shadow, yes, I know, but that's why there is a b/w version at the bottom.
Orange, I think is still a color which attract attention without alarming.
To Aziz:
About connecting the font. yes, I thought of this, but isn't it too much. And there is the problem with direct.com, that it doesn't make sense there to connect the fonts. But both logos should look as a unit.
If I let lead the arrows to the circle, it wouldn't have the same impression like the 'connect' version and so the unity goes.
to Ross:
The company is in the hotel-booking and travel business (and no, there shouldn't be any hotel or house icons in the logo). There will be an addition in the front, like 'Bali-connect.com' or 'Bali-direct.com' (just as an example). The icon will then finally move to the other side.
Thanks for all your comments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sounds like your client would be better off devising a single cohesive, marketable brand, rather than registering and trademarking several million nation-prefixed domains. That would make your task much easier, and they could then use subdomains to cater to every conceivable destination without diluting that brand.

bali.nongenerictravelbusinessname.com
fiji.nongenerictravelbusinessname.com
china.nongenerictravelbusinessname.com
etc.

Unless, that is, their SEO strategy is to build a massive link farm to attack Google with... :/

Aside from that, I wouldn't really associate the words "direct" or "connect" with hotels. One makes me think of flights, the other of telecommunications. Also, how is it "direct" when the business is acting as a middleman between me and my destination hotel?

I suppose none of this will help you with your design, but if the concept is flawed, I don't really see font and color choices mattering that much.

You said hotel, and nothing clicked. Hotels are suppose to be homey like, right? This is too rigid, too technological. Anywho, as for the current logo, That symbol is so over used. I swear I've seen it in at least 3 logos. Rather well known logos too. So this one will get lost.

But yea, those are my two sense for now, I don't want to critique the current logo too much, cause I'm hoping to see something different after you talk to your client.
