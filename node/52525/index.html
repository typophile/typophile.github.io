  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hej all, 
i’ve just finished maison, a sans serif, that is based on a monospaced design, but comes in proportional version too and it would like to know what you think.

you can download a sample pdf [[http://www.123buero.com/MaisonTypeface_123buero.pdf|here]] 
or have a look at this project on my [[http://123buero.com/project.php?id=40|portfolio site]].

thanks,

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Timo.

Somehow, the lowercase a seems much too off. I think you should remove the overshoots for the tail of the lowercase a, and see if it gets better. Also, as the typeface gets bolder, the details become much more obscure (especially for the lowercase n). These bold types are usually set in large sizes, so detail is important, but it's up to you if you made it really that way.

Good luck, and keep it up.

Cheers,
Josef</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am aware you want that one stroke look, but optically a horizontal stroke looks thicker than a vertical one, when using the mathematically same thickness. 

Maybe it might help if you make the horizontals less thick overall. This would solve a lot.

Can two exact font names peacefully coexist? Yes. Farao is one an example.

Emigre does not have to register any of their trademarks in order to claim use of them as trademarks. I never said "registered trademark", or anything about Emigre starting litigation proceedings. "Infringement" of a trademark needs no formal enshrinement to bolster a claim.

<em>also, dilution as a legal term involves famous marks and would have no basis here.</em>

Wanna put money on that? I'm not a lawyer but I have worked for a firm of entertainment lawyers who say you're wrong about that.

<em>So maybe out of respect for Emigre and Barnbrook—and not necessarily for fear of legal reprisal—it might be wise to find another name?

Or email Rudy or Zuzana and ask them. Again, out of respect and wanting to do right</em>

This is the best way of dealing with it if Timo is reluctant to change the name of Maison. Ask them first. I didn't bring this up with the idea of Emigre wanting to take legal action, only that they may have objections and so it would be prudent to either change the name of Maison to something else or consult Emigre about it.

		<div class="commentbody">we'll leave the first one alone because <cite>assemble a claim</cite> can mean anything. I took it to mean, get litigious with an actual legal filing, whereas you probably meant, send a letter.

I know infringement can occur without a registered trademark, but was pointing out that Timo will not face a lawsuit until a mark is filed (and a mark can be expedited for a fee) :)

the second one, it's probably semantics again.

<cite>dilution</cite> is a nebulous term that can mean whatever we want it to mean. 

legally:

<cite>The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 is a United States federal law which protects famous trademarks from uses that dilute their distinctiveness, even in the absence of any likelihood of confusion or competition. It went into effect on January 16, 1996. This act has been largely supplanted by the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (TDRA), signed into law on October 6, 2006.</cite>

also:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_dilution

but there are state statutes that don't require a mark to be famous to be diluted. But those state statutes are really not germane here, i don't think.

Most IP attorneys in the United States—and this is where I'd be willing to bet!—associate the word <cite>dilution</cite> with famous marks.

I didn't want timo to think he was in some kind of predicament... and I wanted to point him toward a possible solution. Which is why i posted.

beyond that:


I'm sure if we were both sitting in the same room having a chat, and not guessing at intent, we'd be on the same page. :D

and looks like we both support the same conclusion.
