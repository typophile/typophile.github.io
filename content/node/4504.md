  body: This is not a font, it&#39;s lettering.  <BR> <BR>Notice how some of the characters
    &#40;c, a, h, etc.&#41; vary. Notice also how tight the spacing is, how some of
    the characters are tucked under others. This is from the days when metal type
    ruled. Hand lettering was a popular way to overcome its limitations and get unique
    headline treatments. <BR> <BR>The basic style is modeled on Caslon, but I don&#39;t
    think you will find any good matches among available fonts.

  body: Font Bureau makes a really condensed Caslon, but it only bears a passing resemblance
    to this sample. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10831364562266125&amp;fontname=CaslonFB"
