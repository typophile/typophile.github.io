  if you drew one alphabet, avoiding the use of copy & paste\u2014just judging by
  eye. Then take a some letters, maybe <em>d, i, Q,</em> and <em>E</em>*, and redraw
  the rest of the alphabet. Probably halfway through, remove your DNA letters, and
  redrew those too. Do it a few times, maybe with different letters for DNA. I wonder
  what you'd come up with.\r\n\r\nI would assume you would get a few alphabets look,
  without close examination, much the same. But if these different sets of letters
  were substituted and interspersed throughout the text would create a lively underdone,
  or perhaps bring back some of the flavor missing from the days when letters were
  things, not pictures, or bezier representations of things.\r\n\r\nThoughts? :)\r\n\r\n\r\n*
  There is no perfect set of DNA letters. I chose <em>d</em> because you have your
  ascender, its serif, a bowl, and the bottom-right terminal that is usually shared
  with <em>u</em> and <em>a</em>; <em>i</em> because you get a dot, x-height serif,
  and baseline serif; <em>Q</em>because it is round, and also has a tail; <em>E</em>
  because it has just about all uppercase serifs in one glyph.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/alpine/a.png\"

    The glyphs that are used more often are the ones that \"need\" more alternates.
    A piece of type that is used more gets worn more. Or, has more sorts made.\r\n\r\nDoes

    those letters which appear most often next to, or close to, each other.\r\n\r\nWith
    that in mind, I developed a pseudo-random feature that requires only one alternate.\r\nThe
    theory is that because there are virtually no instances in which a letter appears
    three times in a row, two letters may be coded so that the closest they appear
    is separated by four letters, far enough apart to not be present simultaneously
    in the fovea, which is the only circumstance in which artifacts are detectable

    any case, I'm making a script to count glyph pair occurrence in a given document
    (actually, it's almost done). It would take little effort to make it count trios,
    or larger groups. With little modification, I could count occurrence of glyph
    pairs near one another. For example, how often e occurs next to i with three glyphs
    between."

    Making alternate characters by \"accident\" isn't nearly as interesting or useful

    the results could be trivial. Which might make the idea less interesting.\r\n\r\nThanks

    approach. Even with a "true" random, some guiding has to be done to make the letters
    excellent rather than just interesting.
