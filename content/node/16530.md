  just agreed upon a really deep blue,\r\nnot the final PMS. Thats why I asked, is
  PMS 296 a good choice, or is\r\nthere a more \u201Cpotent\u201D blue PMS around?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks:\r\n[url]www.hytechpro.com[/url]\r\n"

  body: I find Reflex Blue to be a nice deep blue. Only problem with it that printers
    hate to work with it, because of it's tendency to bleed and overset.

  body: 296 is so deep it's nearly black. It has the benefit of looking pretty much
    the same in cmyk (100c, 80m, 0y, 66k). Not bad, if that's what you're looking
    for.

  body: "Mili raises a good point. When building a brand, I always like to pick not
    only spot colors, but process colors as well. You have to think about how this
    brand will avail itself in all sorts of media. Unfortunately, you can't run Reflex
    (or any other PMS spot) in a newspaper or magazine ad.\r\n\r\nThat said, I've
    always had an affinity for 302 -- it's bold and corporate. And while the 4-color
    breakdown (c=100 m=43 y=12 k=56) is rather muddy, Pantone DS 224-1 C (c=100 m=35
    y=0 k=40) is a good alternative, particularly for Newsprint. I like to use the
    Pantone Process colors in conjunction with the solids. It's always easier to tear
    a chip than count on your vendor's color management system. (It's usually more
    reliable than your own CMS as well!)\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend the <a href=\"http://www.pantone.com/products/products.asp?idArea=1&idArticleType=25&idProduct=304\">Pantone
    Color Bridge</a>, which shows you the CMYK, RGB, and HEX values for each solid.
    You'll be surprised at how poorly most rich blues (and oranges and pinks) reproduce
    in 4-color. You will also often find that a Pantone Process color (or your own
    custom CMYK mix) is a better CMYK representation of the solid than the default
    mix."
