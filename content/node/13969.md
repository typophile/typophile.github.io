body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Aperture</strong>\r\n\r\nAn \"aperture\"
  is a constricted opening of a [[glyph]]. For example, the lowercase \"e\" has an
  aperture at 4 o'clock. This aperture is relatively small in some fonts (such as
  Avant Garde) and much larger (or more open) in others (such as Frutiger). It is
  widely believed that a relatively large aperture helps [[readability]].\r\n\r\nSee
  also [[Counter]]."
