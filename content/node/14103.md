body: "The Berlin-based  type foundry of Dutch designer [[Lucas de Groot]]\r\nIn 1997,
  having worked as a type director at MetaDesign Berlin for four years, De Groot founded
  his own type production company, FontFabrik, specializing in creating custom fonts
  for magazines and corporations.\r\nThree years later, he created the LucasFonts
  brand for his growing library of retail fonts. \r\nDesigners at the studio include
  Jan Fromm and Elena Albertoni, who have both won acclaim for their own type designs
  as well as contributing to the design and production of De Groot's typefaces. Many
  of the LucasFonts typefaces were originally made for a specific client and a precise
  purpose, such as a newspaper (Taz), magazine (Spiegel) or corporate identity (Corpid,
  Sun). The most successful type family  issued by LucasFontsis is the Thesis superfamily
  (TheSans, TheSerif, TheMix), which was originally released by FSI as a FontFont
  in 1994, but has been a LucasFonts product from 2000 onwards.\r\n\r\n<strong>External
