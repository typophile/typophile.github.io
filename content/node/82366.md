body: I am designing a range of items for a contemporary art gallery. Akzidenz Grotesk
  has been the main house font in the past, and I want to retain this and make it
  more consistent. I would like to use AG as the display face throughout, and as the
  text face in promotional print. However, I do not want to use AG for extended reading,
  and in the gallery's catalogues I would like to employ a serif as the text face,
  while retaining AG for display. Arnhem Blond is one font I am considering, and I
  like it's subtly contemporary feel. Would anyone have any comments, or other suggestions?

  body: "Thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nCalibre and Metric I did not know - good
    to see them.\r\n\r\nAnd Sabon, funnily enough, was the other font I was considering.
    I agree it does work well with AG. I know that garalde fonts are often recommended
    as companions to AG, and that Sabon is considered a modern version of a garalde.
    But I was ideally looking for something that feels a bit more contemporary than
    Sabon - much as I like it.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts for a serif with a subtly contemporary
    flavour?\r\n"

    in conclusion I still want to find a serif, rather than a slab.

    it might just as well be Arial.\r\n\r\nFor a complementary text face, good old
    Times Roman would be perfect.\r\n\r\nThis is a golden age of new type. Step out
    of the past, roll up your sleeves, get rid of the AG and try to evolve this identity
    into something more truly contemporary, not just the usual art house clich\xE9."
