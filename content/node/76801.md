  isn't impact. \r\nIdeally i'd like to use Knockout, and distress it myself, but
  i cannot do this due to the licensing restrictions i have on the project i'm working
  on (it requires a base font file to be included as it's for software)\r\n\r\nIt
  could have a comic book feel but cannot be too distressed to be unreadable, as i
  said, knockout is perfect (after i've distressed it), but not viable in this case.
  321impact is the closest i can find, but it's a bit too distressed and not in the
  way i'd like.\r\n\r\nPredistressed is good as i know if can get a license for it
  i won't have a problem with customising.. but feel free to suggest undistressed
  fonts from other authors too.. as they may not have such tight licensing restrictions
  as HF&J.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are welcomed! :)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    fairly decent quality, and open source.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
