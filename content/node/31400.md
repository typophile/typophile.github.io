body: "The logo I have done is for an industrial park in a small village in Germany.
  The park consists of some larger companys like an engineering company or a window-builder
  but also a gym, chips chops and a children's playground. The industrial park would
  like to print some flyers in a few days when they have an open day! They dont want
  to make advertisement for themselves but for the companys which are in the park.
  But therefor they first need a logo. However they want to win some new customers/lessee
  too.\r\nI made a new font for their logo. It has rounded corners that looks friendly
  but not too childish and has large counters. For the icon I made a simplified depot
  which is almost similar to the german road sign for an industrial park.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts would be very helpful especially on the spacing :)\r\n\r\n\r\nGreeting:
  Steven"

  body: "I would say that BO of Borchen is just about right in terms of kerning and
    that should act as the basis of the kerning for the rest, nearly every other pair
    needs to be a touch tighter. I wonder if the icon is too industrial (as opposed
    to retail), but I would amend the radii of the curves around the roof, maybe use
    the sharp corners on the inside and rouunded on the outside.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Hey Tim,\r\n\r\nthank you for your hints. I changed the logo a bit that it
    doesnt look like a logo for a heavy industries park anymore. Unfortunately I didnt
    had time to make the kerning yet. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Borcher-Logo-002_6630.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo!
    Any criticism is welcome :)"

  body: "I like the shape of the mark in the first example (the factory silhouette)
    better than the cubes. You might want to give it a 3D treatment like in the left
    hand side of the latest post.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Hey Lex,\r\n\r\nI also like the shape factory more, but it is a bit too industrial
    for the park. There are amongst others an engineering company, a window-builder
    but also a gym, chips chops and a children\u2019s playground. The shape of a factory
    would disregard the gym and so on. The park has more than just heavy industry.
    But maybe I try what you mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteven"

  body: I like the open cubes. I might expand on the cubes and make them multidimensional
    looking as expansive. I would make the type a different weight than the mark.
    You need some separation, make it bolder or lighter. Everything feels the same
    weight. Make priorities to your message. Ask yourself what is most important.
    Is it the graphic (I doubt it) is it the name (I think so) and the location (a
    throw away). Make each element stronger or less strong to stress the message.

  body: "Thank you all for your hints so far. I send them the logos with two cubes.
    It is something like a small pitch for what i done that. So I will start working
    on it when they choose one of my logos. If they want me to change something on
    it!?\r\n\r\n\r\nSteven"

  body: "I would have a look at the perspective of the smaller box, in comparison
    with the larger box it is wider and the lefthand side is going toward a different
    vanishing point. I do like the concept of the new mark though.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I just got the message!\r\n\r\nThey dont want my concept. Im not very sad
    about that because I have a new concept for a font now. Im just a bit amused when
    I take a look at the designs that won. Taht happens if you arent able to be on
    location and the presentation only happens via e-mail :) \r\n\r\nThank you once
    again for the hints you all gave me. Greetings: Steven"
