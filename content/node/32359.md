  body: Pdf is hardly secure. You can outline any typefaces in a pdf, but those will
    still be vectors.

  body: "Atif, \r\n\r\nno font embedding can be \"totally secure\". If fonts need
    to be displayed on screen, one can produce a bitmap (which will only work in one
    size) or one can produce a digital document with outlines embedded (e.g. Flash,
    PDF, PostScript, OpenXML, SVG etc.). In the latter case, some software needs to
    access the font outlines in order to draw them on screen (or perhaps print it
    as well). If there are font outlines and there is software that draws them on
    screen, then there can be no \"total security\", especially if the formats are
    published. PDF, Flash, PostScript, OpenXML, SVG are all publicly specified formats
    so anybody can write software that reads the font information embedded in them,
    and produces a more-less functioning font out of them. In fact, I have seen various
    pieces of software that is able to extract font information out of every single
    document format I have listed above. This is normal: as a format developer, if
    you publish the specification so people can write software that displays those
    formats on screen or prints them, it is not possible to \"magically\" prevent
    other people from writing software that just extracts the fonts. \r\n\r\nNote
    however, that in many countries, developing or using such software -- to extract
    copyrightable fonts -- may be illegal. So in some cases, people \"can\" (technically)
    develop such software but \"may not\" (legally) do that. \r\n\r\nAlso, in many
    cases, fonts embedded in digital documents are only subsets of the original, fully-functional
    fonts. For example, in some formats only a small part of the glyph set is embedded
    in the document. Also, usually, information such as kerning, OpenType Layout tables
    and sometimes hinting does not get embedded. In other words, the extracted \"fonts\"
    will usually not be functionally equivalent to the original fonts, they will always
    be crippled versions of the true things. Apart of a small group of hardcore font
    collector geeks, I very much doubt that anyone would be interested in pirating
    such fonts. After all, it is mostly easier to get ahold of the original fonts
    and pirate these, rather than dealing with awkward font extraction processes.
    \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"
