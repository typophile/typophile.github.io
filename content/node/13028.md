  a good idea to have all of them installed.  I need a good font manager.  Do I understand
  a font manager will let you preview and use a font without actually installing it
  ... just indicated the font and leave the font manager running? \r\nThanks!"

    \"font management software\" but then I did one myself, and I was very scared
    with the top results. I suggest you take a look at Extensis' Suitcase and Adobe's
    ATM, which can be found in Support -> Downloads at their website. ATMLight is
    free, but I'm not sure it does what you want.\r\n\r\nOh, and I'm sure other people
    can point other good software and/or companies. I point these two because they're
    the ones I'm more familiar with."

    body: Thanks!  A freeway by Sue Fisher called The Font Thing has also been recommended
      but being freeware, I am concerned and thought it would be wise to look into
      it more ... so I turned here where the experts are :)

    similar for Windows?

  body: "I thought I'd bump this after a quick search left me even more confused.
    Considering this thread is almost 5 years old now , is there anything currently
    on the market that you guys could suggest in the way of font management? \r\n\r\nI'm
    looking to invest in something that's easy to use , and one that provides a little
    flexibility in both Windows 2000 & Windows xp , as these are my two primary operating
    systems.\r\n\r\nAny help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance. "

    also Suitcase Fusion from Extensis."

  body: "A great font manager is \"Font Suit\" from Iseatech - www.iseasoft.com\r\n\r\nI
    use it myself. It allows you to create different sets of fonts for different projects
    and activate fonts as and when required. By activate I mean temporarily install.
    On restarting the computer or closing the software, the font is deactivated. So
    its slightly bothersome having to keep fontsuit open while working with its fonts."
