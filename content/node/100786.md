    you agree that the person giving an answer is not responsible for the question,

    by confirming the ID (which he actually never did)? Could you explain your interpretation
    of Akira's second post in particular?\r\n\r\nHow to identify plagiarism is a good
    question, and it might take a team of talents to do so. Do you think we have such
    a team here? :-)  And I certainly agree that people depend on other people's morality.
    Isn't that a rule of society as a whole, and Typophile in particular? And no matter
    what a society is doing, isn't somebody's own behavior his own responsibility?\r\n\r\nFor
    myself, when I take back an answer it's usually not easy, and I think it's never
    too late to make a difference (especially considering these threads can be referred
    to). The stage for tomorrow is set today.\r\n\r\nBTW, I wasn't taking a shot at
    Nick Curtis - in fact we're sort of friends. I was simply making an observation,
    and he would probably confirm it. And don't you think it's relevant that different
    people elect to work with outfits like Autumn Leaves differently, based on their
