  body: "The online tools usually compare your image against a database of modern
    Digital Fonts.\r\nFor a text so old, there is always the possibility that the
    actual (wooden/metal) font is not transferred to a digital one, or to find a digital
    variation which is close but not an exact match.\r\n\r\nI think <strong>Romana
    Medium / Romana Bold</strong> is a good starting point for your search:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/romana/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1800_system_4847.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1800_phanomenologie_6156.jpg]\r\n"
