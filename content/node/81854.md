  body: "I should have been clearer - it's the main typeface I'm interested in. The
    \"Lire\" is a different typeface, and the \"Petit Dejeuner\" appears to be a condensed
    version of the main typeface.\r\n\r\nHouschka is very similar, but it was released
    in 1999 so perhaps it is based on this earlier typeface shown here. Can anyone
    advise if Houschka was inspired by an earlier typeface?"

  body: "I was working on it in 1997 when I happened to see a sign over a confectioners
    shop in Salzburg - Georg Houschka - which was very similar to my existing design,
    even the rounded A. Unfortunately I don't have a digital photo of it, and it no
    longer exists. So the answer to your question is no, Houschka wasn't inspired
    by an earlier typeface, but the name was inspired by a shop sign.\r\n\r\nI was
    probably subconsciously inspired by European signage from earlier visits. The
    style is quite 'Continental Europe' IMO, especially Austria and Italy, but not
    so much UK.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.type.co.uk/a_to_z_listing/id/40847\">Houschka

    Thanks for explaining that, Nick.
