  for the first time?\r\n\r\nI am an experienced graphic designer, interested in creating
  my own font. Something that included a little digital know-how would be appreciated."

  body: You could start with "the [[Triumvirate]]." Then, for technical know-how,
    consider <a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/">Leslie Cabarga's books</a>.

  body: "Although as previously noted considerations of spacing are maybe not given
    enough time in Karen's book.\r\n\r\nAbout Face: Reviving the Rules of Typography
    by David Jury might be of some use. \r\n\r\nThis might be useful, although it
    does need to be updated a bit more ( my fault ) .\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/books/\r\n\r\nThe
    truth is you have to think of yourself as a bee collecting bits of insight here
    & there.\r\n\r\nFor sheer how to though Leslie's book is still #1. You can also
    ask for help here on Typophile as well."

  body: "Okay, another vague memory (thanks for the clarifications on Ludlow). I seem
    to remember some type where a part of the letterform hung over the underlying
    base, for kerning purposes (hand set type). I am thinking of the ball of an f,
    (or half of it). It would lie over the base of the following letter, and thus
    print correctly.\r\n\r\nAm I remembering correctly? These are 40 year old memories,
    and I was a reporter then, not a graphic artist, so I wasn't handling this equipment
    myself."

  body: "Get <em>Exploring Typography</em> by Tova Rabinowitz. For the most part it\u2019s
    your standard Typography primer formatted as a textbook, but it has an excellent
    chapter on designing a typeface. Rabinowitz literally guides the reader through
    the design letter by letter\u2014with no software instruction\u2014using a system
    of developing letters from each other and using generic spacing values presented
    in tables. "
