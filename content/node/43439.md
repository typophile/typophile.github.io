body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI recently posted a problem regarding an Opentype font (dearJoe
  4) which seemed to be problematic when used in Word. Since then a couple of new
  problems have arised which are of a different nature and so my previous post's title
  doesn't quite fit the problem anymore. Since the previous post only got one reply
  I thought it might be a good idea to post this again, with a title that suits the
  problem better.\r\n\r\nSo here's the problems:\r\n\r\n\u201CIn Word:\r\nThe font
  is listed (in it\u2019s style). When I select the font, the resulting type in the
  font window and the document says dear Joe 4, but looks like a standard font. It
  appears that it is not reading the font file, but is automatically substituting
  another font.\r\n\r\nIn Photoshop:\r\nThe font name does not even appear in the
  list.\r\n\r\nIn Corel Draw:\r\nThe font name appears in the list and the font works
  fine.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd also:\r\n\r\n\u201CTesting the TrueType format of the DearJoe
  Four font in my Win2000 system using Publisher2000 and get an error message saying
  the font is not available on my system, however, when I selected \u2019use it anyway\u2019
  I was able to continue and use the font without fault.\r\n\r\nUsing the font in
  a variety of alternate applications I found the font to function as expected, without
  fault.\r\n\r\n~however~\r\n\r\nTesting the font in a WinXP system in Publisher2003
  I\u2019m experiencing similar \u2019not available\u2019 errors, however, I\u2019m
  not getting the proper font when selecting \u2019use it anyway\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
  obviously there\u2019s something wrong with the font...\r\nI have generated the
  font the same way as I always do and this problem has never occured. I just can\u2019t
  figure out where the problem is. Maybe it\u2019s got something to do with the fact
  that the font has A LOT of kerning pairs, but please, if someone would be so kind
  to check this font I\u2019d be happy to send the file to them.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance and best regards,\r\n\r\n"

  body: Have you checked your codepage coverage support in the OS/2 table? If you
    are seeing a different font in Word, that usually indicates that RichEdit thinks
    the font is unsuitable for the language you are trying to type, which may be due
    to incorrectly set codepage support in the OS/2 table. That would explain why
    the font might work okay in some other apps, which might not be performing the
    same checks as RichEdit.

    the end of the font's family name... Now that this space was removed the font
    works fine.\r\n\r\nThanks for replying and best regards,\r\n\r\nJoe"
