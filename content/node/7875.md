  body: What does the D or the two circles have to do with multimedia or the company
    itself other than use the first initials of the name?  It just seems that it&#39;s
    going to be rather generic and hard to remember.  I don&#39;t get the sense that
    it has anything to do with multimedia, and multimedia itself is rather generic
    term in of itself.
