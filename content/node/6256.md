    Luc&#40;as&#41; de Groot</a><i>esque</i>&#34;. <BR> <BR>;&#41; <BR> <BR>Can anybody
    compare it with Corpid Bold Italic, please? My LucasFonts catalogue is at home.
    <BR>Sorry I&#39;m so useless these days, but somebody took off with our copy of

    I really like <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/"> your place</a>: you&#39;ve
    got a well-defined identity and a selection of delightful typefaces. <BR> <BR>As
    about getting jokes: I usually get them, <i>and</i> I&#39;ve got an elephant hide,

    Stephen and Hrant</a> can attest &#40;unfortunately the jokes in this thread aren&#39;t

    bullets with it.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Speaking of de Groot, I really liked how he
    took Folha &#40;commissioned for the titling of a Brazilian newspaper&#41;, made
    it more &#34;incised&#34; &#40;like the French like it&#41;, and used it to satisfy
    the commission from Le Monde for <i>their</i> titles. <BR> <BR>BTW, Parisine Plus
    is one of my fav JFP fonts. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: What does &#34;Le Folha&#34; mean? <BR> <BR>Yeah, de Groot is very good at
    re-using &#40;and interpolating&#41;, which is fine by me as long as the source
    is good, and his always is. And what&#39;s very refreshing is that he <i>promotes</i>
    that aspect of his work method, while many others hide it. BTW, the Le Monde face
    is called Floris &#40;after his son&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    Monde would mind any closeness more than the Brazilian predecessor, but apparently
    they don&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Unger: <BR>In fact I recently saw a comparison of three
    of his news faces, and at the same point size and column width the linebreaks
    throughout a piece of a number of paragraphs were nearly totally identical! That
    tells me he has an &#34;ideal&#34; of individual letter-widths in his head, and
    for a while now. <BR> <BR>I think when your oeuvre has a lot of uniformity it
    means you&#39;re a thinking man, as opposed to being overly market-driven. <BR>
