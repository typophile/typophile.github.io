  \r\nI just bought this bike and I am having a h*ll of a time figuring out what font
  these decals are. I am going to have to get the bike repainted and order new decals.
  \ I have found several places that make decals with 1000's of fonts but I have no
  clue what font this is.  There is no bike company to call because they went out
  of business years ago.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to insult anyone's intelligence or
  profession, I just need some help figuring this one out and after 3 days of searching
  I am tapped.\r\n\r\nany advice or even a close guess would get me further than I
  am right now.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\nPeace.\r\nDjD"

  body: I think that is hand-made, not a font. Like BMC, GIANT, ROSE, BIANCHI, CERVELO,
    SCOTT etc. Logotypes.
