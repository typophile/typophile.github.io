  figure out the main font (\"Sakura Bana\" and the phone number). \r\nI've tried
  WhattheFont but I could not identify the font I needed. Since the file's PDF was
  exported from Adobe Illustrator, the font's information is not available in the
  properties...\r\n\r\nIf there needs to be more information regarding this then I
  will be more than happy to add it. I suppose the next resource I could turn to is
  to contact the card designer him/herself (...though the card was made over a year
  ago). \r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\n"
