body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heb_4999.png]\r\n\r\nI have a (very) rough
  Hebrew version here. This does not match well with the Latin. I had originally though
  that to make the Hebrew match, I should try to make much of the structure similar.
  But, that really only ended up with a highly angular, complicated design. It has
  become clear to me (partially through the guidance of fellow Typophiles here), that
  I should match the color first, and then try to make some of the finer details similar.
  I think a simpler, less angular Hebrew will match better with this, and I'll also
  be able to fit the color better that way.\r\n\r\nThe widths and proportions obviously
  are everywhere, I haven't had time to study the different widths of Hebrew letters
  as yet - I still need to buy a copy of Romm Vilna, FrankRuhl, Hadasa, Narkissim,
  and Koren, possibly Nathan, David (any suggestions on specific versions of any of
  these? I can't believe I'm going to shell out so much money on fonts at once!).
  I started to analyze the proportions of STAM, but that is as yet uncomplete.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heb_4999.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uc_4708.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lc_6093.png]\r\n\r\nI
  thought I'd post this and see what everyone thinks - perhaps it will help me with
  my next rendition.\r\n\r\nAs a note on the origin of this version of the design,
  I've based it upon Hebrew types from several periods, and also tried to match some
  parts to the Latin.\r\n\r\nShabbat Shalom!"

    Hebrew glyphs appear being larger even than the Latin capitals. That may become
    a problem in mixed typesetting.\r\nIt is a general issue when a bicameral script
    is combined with a unicameral one: which height should the latter get?\r\nI tend
    towards a solution where the unicase part (Hebr.) gets rendered at a height considerably
    lower than that of the Latin capitals."
