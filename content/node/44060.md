  body: "Many would say that Linotype Sabon with oldstyle figures is the closest to
    perfect among serif text faces. Hands down the finest for book texts. \r\n\r\nSome
    runners up: Plantin Light at 11pt or above, also with oldstyle figures...I chose
    this for a series of poetry books I'm doing and I've fallen in love with it all
    over again. Requiem would be up there too if only the foundry added bold and bold
    italic, although I still think that italic wandered in from another family. Arno
    Pro italics match up better, but Arno lacks Requiem's superior details, such as
    the oldstyle figure for five. And I'm increasingly impressed with Adobe's Warnock,
    something of a dark horse on the type market. If you're choosing by point size,
    the best serif text family at 9pt is Stone Serif...horsey if it gets much larger,
    but at 9pt, simply peerless, and the three italics look even better than the romans.
    The finest Baskerville is certainly ITC New Baskerville, which works well everywhere.
    If you like your letterforms a little condensed, then Esta is right up there with
    Minion. If you choose by personality, and want something warm and intimate, Ludwig
    \xDCbele's new Marat family is very appealing indeed. If it ever bothered you
    that Fournier never got bold and bold italics, you can switch to Josh Darden's
    Corundum instead, a real instant classic. And I would issue a shout-out for Haarlemmer,
    a little-known but really beautiful family with much the same appeal as Sabon;
    Storm's Regent II; and FF Scala, especially good in books, right up there with
    Janson Text.\r\n\r\nDon't get me started !!"
