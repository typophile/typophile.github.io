    to stick to the proper syntax. :^)\r\n\r\nThe (x) at the beginning denotes thet
    the thread has been IDed. Then comes a description of what the request was, followed
    by a hyphen and the name(s) of the font(s). At the end comes the name of the IDer
    between curly brackets.\r\n\r\nAnd anyhow I like to double-check if the ID was
    correct -- you never know. ;^)"
