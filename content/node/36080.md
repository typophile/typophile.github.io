  to be old and classy, trustworthy and honest.\r\n\r\nI have NO idea on how to do
  this. Has anyone got examples of this executed well with this type of font?\r\n\r\nIve
  just pasted the default one with shadows, then copy and move 45 degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "One option:\r\n\r\nCreate 3 layers (as you've done).\r\n\r\nTop is as-is.\r\n\r\nSecond
    layer is stroked with white at a rather thick line weight.\r\n\r\nBottom is as
    is (moved at the 45 degree angle).\r\n\r\nIt will give you a similar effect but
    the 'shadow' will float more."

  body: "I second Darrel's suggestion. The white layer should stay directly behind
    the top layer.\r\n\r\nI'd also suggest reducing the angle due to the angles in
    the 'A' and 'R'. See what works best.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Another effect is to do two layers one a light gray with a solid black over
    it.
