  of victorian, edwardian, turn of the century i.e vintage fonts.  Does anyone here
  know where I could find some, I don't even mind if it is just examples of typeface
  or book covers (actually that would be interesting!) , I don't need to download
  it, have a set of typefaces to work with, I just need a source of examples/a few
  words as I can easily copy it by hand from the computer screen and make up the rest
  of the lettering.  Any ideas?"

    unique fonts, at least that I know of...besides that I suggest you scour the internet
    for old book covers/posters/whatever from the Victorian era or hit the library.
    You can also search for type specimen books from that era.\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: 'Keep in mind that many of Letterhead''s fonts are contemporary American sign
    painter interpretations of Victorian style. They are very expressive, but not
    necessarily the most authentic source. I would look at books published during
    the era you''re interested in for a more accurate representation of what was going
    on at the time. Like Jon said: time for a trip to the library!'
