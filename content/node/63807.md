body: The Public Radio International program "To the Best of Our Knowledge" just did
  an hour on fonts. There were interviews with Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones
  and with Matthew Carter. The program is online for a week at [[http://wpr.org/book/]].

  body: OK, really 45 minutes of radio about fonts, and 15 minutes of radio about
    how sad it is that kids don't learn [enough] handwriting anymore. :-[

  body: Sure 75% is good if you look at it that way, but why not make it 100%? Font
    coverage is hard enough to get, and rare enough; they wouldn't have to twist it
    all around in the end and conclude that really, handwriting is just so *natural*
    and *personal* and let's all write letters by hand now. It seems to give the preceding
    font talk sort of a weird aftertaste. But maybe that's just me.
