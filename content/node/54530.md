  body: I was thinking from the greyscale image that it was something fairly old too.
    However I've just seen this poster on one of the local Indian shops. It is for
    a recent Bollywood film and the lettering does look digital. Given that India
    has always had a great tradition of lettering design, especially geared towards
    its film industry, there could be a lot of fonts designed there which are not
    marketed elsewhere.
