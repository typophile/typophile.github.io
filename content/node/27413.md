body: "Is there any program like \"Bitstream Font Navigator\" can show us the PFB
  font files?\r\nI meant I have a lot of PFB file and I would like to arrange them
  in groups so I want to see the display of the font then decide which I should add
  to.\r\n\r\nAs you know, I can open them in FLS 5, but that will be a difficult task.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help."

    Expert 2005</a> not only lets you view complete character sets of Postscript,
    Truetype and Opentype fonts <em>and</em> organize them into sets, but it also
    has a pretty nifty array of font specimen printout options. And it's relatively
    inexpensive.
