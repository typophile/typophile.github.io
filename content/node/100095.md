  body: Can be wrong but to me, it's rather a custom logo design than a font as it.
    You can start for instance with any black generic sans like Akzidenz Grotesk (to
    get such /R with a straight leg), Helvetica (wrong /R) or Neue Haas Grotesk (right
    /R as alternate), vectorize the all thing, move letters up and down, make some
    cuts and work on connections.
