body: "I've been trying to find the font used in the following titles , but having
  very little luck. In a skewed sort of way , it reminds me of Friz Quadrata , but
  of course some of the characters are way off. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize the
  type used here , and if so , could please provide the name. Thanks in advance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/titles_5342.jpg]"

  body: I think this is a heavy version of Albertus. The official release available
    from Adobe and Monotype doesn't have this weight, as it wasn't part of the original
    design. But I remember seeing a heavy version like this on one of those cheap
    1001 fonts CDs years ago.
