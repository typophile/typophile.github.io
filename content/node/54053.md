  is sold by students to basically anyone, in May. It's not a big fancy release, the
  editorial group consisting of 5-6 people relatively new to print. \r\n\r\nThe magazine
  is released during the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ|\"Russefeiring\"]] in
  Norway.\r\n\r\nBut before designing the magazine, I would love if you guys could
  tell me what to try out or watch out for. I want the magazine to look professional,
  but it should still shine through that students are behind it.\r\n\r\nIt's the first
  time I design anything like this, and I haven't been using InDesign much. Any tips
  regarding typography, layout or anything else is appreciated! Don't hesitate to
  ask questions about content etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMarius "
