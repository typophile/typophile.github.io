  body: "Try this: Take the \u2018e\u2019 from the upright bold weight and slant it
    by ten degrees. The result will match the \u2018e\u2019 from your sample. And
    note that they also changed the exclamation mark. This is why I wrote \u2018based
    on\u2019."

  body: "Right, but I don\u2019t think that this cut is still available. \u2018Mic
    32\u2019 (which only had an oblique) was replaced by \u2018Mic 32 New\u2019 (which
    only has an italic).\r\n\r\nPS: Where do you always get those aliased samples
    from? Your contributions are very helpful, but looking at the images you post
    makes me cringe."

    Sorry. I haven't figured out the aliasing solution. There are a lot apps between
    the font and the forum."
