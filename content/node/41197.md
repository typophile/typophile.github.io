  on Typophile Miguel Sousa has described his <strong>adhesiontext</strong> online
  tool for generating words using a given set of letters in various languages including
  Arabic. It is a great resource and should be incorporated into Fontlab! \r\n\r\nI
  installed my new font and set it as the default font in my Firefox browser. <strong>adhesiontext</strong>
  allowed me to see hundreds of Arabic dictionary words displayed in my font.  My
  question here is whether there is a way to generate random nonsense words, also
  of paired combinations of chosen glyphs? A choice of point size would also be a
  great addition to this tool. Thanks Miguel. www.adhesiontext.com/\r\n\r\nVladimir"

    that I think you're better off using Tim Ahrens' <a href=\"http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/generator/\">Just
    Another Test Text Generator</a>. Tim talks about it in this thread http://www.typophile.com/node/32756\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure that having fake words is ideal. I think that if you don't use real words
    you won't get the correct texture and the usual letter combinations for that given
    language. For example, if you're testing a typeface to be used mainly for setting
    German, you should make sure that the text content is German, otherwise you won't
    get the correct frequency of accented and unusual letters (\xC4\xE4\xD6\xF6\xDC\xFC\xDF),
    and uppercase letters (in German, nouns -- such as 'dog', 'Hund' -- all start
    with a cap letter).\r\n\r\nI must say that the text sample delivered by Tim's
    tool comes pretty close to that desired texture, but still. But then, adhesiontext
    isn't perfect either as its algorithm doesn't have any considerations regarding
    the language syntax. I guess that's the trade-off of having random and dynamic
    text, as opposed to \"Lorem ipsum\"-like text or text samples grabbed from Wikipedia,
    for example, that are static.\r\n\r\n> <em>A choice of point size would also be
    a great addition to this tool.</em>\r\n\r\nThe tool was written to be a text generator,
    not a typesetting tool ;^) (Over time I've been happily surprised to hear about
    how people are using adhesiontext) In any case, the whole page will scale when
    you change the type size of your browser. I hope that works for you."

  body: "Thanks Miguel for your detailed and interesting reply. This is my first font,
    and was not sure what was the best procedure. I agree with you that seeing whole
    word-shapes is critical for judging a font, but I was worried that, as in proofreading
    text, the eye ignores a mistake because the sentence has meaning (reading the
    text backwards works against this tendency). That is why I suggested random words
    and the link you provided does that nicely. Oh if in the future you have time,
    perhaps you can find a way to incorporate diacritical marks (harakat) to the Arabic
    text in adhesiotext that would make it even more useful.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,I
    do agree with you that real words must be used at some stage. By the way speaking
    of word-shapes, Arabic has a particular advantage over Latin here, because the
    majority of the letters have geometrically unique shapes (if the dot pattern is
    included as a shape element), serving legibility. At first glance a line of Arabic
    appears untidy compared to Latin type, but words have generally unique outlines.
    Latin tends to have a generally rectangular word-shape as high as the x with occasional
    bumps when capital letters, ascenders or descenders occur.  \r\n\r\nYou are right
    about text size as a browser function. \r\n\r\nTo help me study kerning pairs
    I have devised an analog method to quickly test hundreds of pairs of glyphs systematically
    one against another, and hope to detail images of the method soon. Is there a
    \ digital method, apart from using ready-made class lists?  \r\n\r\nVladimir"
