  for both the bold caps sans-serif and the body text sans-serif used in this cool
  1967 boyscout \"Camp Tenderfoot Scoreboard.\"  Thank you!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Tail on _g_ is too short for Futura, but fits Vogue Sans. But other Letters
    in Vogue Sans like _C_ and _M_ don't fit ... a 1967 puzzle.\r\nDon"

  body: "I do believe you have found the final piece to the puzzle. This specimen
    chart seems to confirms our preliminary view that the _Tenderfoot Scoreboard_
    of 1967 is Vogue Sans.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: The Boy Scouts of America, in bold, reminds me of [[http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/4539/tempo|Tempo]],
    mostly because of the S, A, R and the M. The body text looks like Vogue. This
    layout might consist of the two, which is an odd idea. That would almost be like
    a layout featuring both Futura and Kabel.
