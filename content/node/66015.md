body: "Ticketbook family is insipired by movie poster information, which is usually
  set in Helvetica or Univers Compressed/Ultra Light.\r\n\r\nI decided to make a family
  of seven weights for this type of use. With optical weight adjustment, you can set
  smaller point size text below larger one, and use heavier variant to compensate
  for the reduction in size.\r\n\r\nNow available from MyFonts.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ticketbook1_5849.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
  more as a pdf:\r\n"
