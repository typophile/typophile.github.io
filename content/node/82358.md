  The name turns up in some very interesting places. It's usually good for a laugh.
  Yesterday, I found that I could download almost our entire catalogue on filesonic,
  and we are in good company. Many of the largest foundries are represented/pirated
  there. I wasn't certain if I should be angry, amused, or flattered. Now I have to
  go through all of the red tape to get our fonts removed, afterwhich I have to keep
  doing searches waiting for the person to put them online somewhere else. I would
  love for someone to help me see the silver lining in this.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: I like it. It feels nice when they put them together in a nice package. If
    they pirate you, it means they like your work. I don't like those trash heap 100000000
    font collections because they're slapped together with no care. They've got multiple
    versions of the same fonts, broken fonts, improperly named fonts, converted by
    Alltype junk... it's disrespectful.

  body: "I would say its an honor. The music theft pov goes like this:\r\n\r\n1. Piracy
    is a fairly sincere form of flattery.\r\n2. In the \"attention economy,\" they're
    actually helping get your work \"out there.\" ie. With hundreds of thousands other
    fonts out there, the trick is getting people to notice your work.\r\n3. The people
    stealing your work aren't people who were likely to buy it anyway. They're kids,
    students, etc. - people not even close to being professional designers.  It's
    a homemade educational discount."
