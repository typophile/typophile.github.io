body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nWhile on vacation in Florida I was able to snatch up two clients.
  Here is the business card for the first. \r\n\r\nAt first I wanted to get the look
  of Fournier's \"Manual Typographique\" with lots of ornaments but that would take
  up too much space and get really rococo really fast.\r\n\r\nThe feel (I'm going
  for- this time) is buttoned-down british hunt club/french europe. I'm using Didot
  for the entire identity. (I'm trying to avoid the wild-wild-west look that's over
  used and abused in Florida)\r\n\r\nTell me about the spacing. \r\nShould I used
  another font- like a sans or a script? \r\nIs it too tight? Tell me all your thoughts.
  \r\nDoes this look make you think $$$$ expensive? It supposed to.\r\n\r\nAnd what
  do you think of the section at the bottom:\r\n\r\nfull board,\r\npartial board,\r\npasture
  board,\r\n& retirees\r\n\r\nor should it be:\r\n\r\nfull, partial & pasture board\r\nplus
  retirees\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for all your help(s),\r\n\r\nMike Diaz\r\n\r\n\r\nPS>>>>>THE
  C3 AND C4 PDF ARE THE NEWST!!!"

  body: "Spontaneously, it feels great! If it fits with their image and clientele,
    of course.\r\n\r\nI like the striped background. With the right kind of paper,
    it can be very strong.\r\n\r\nIf you go for the one with one without background,
    I would consider doing the border embossed instead of printed, and use a nice
    thick  paper.\r\n\r\nDouble divider line: keep, but I think it's a bit strong
    as it is. Tone down somehow (width or color)."

  body: "Hello again:\r\n\r\nOkay here is some updates to the Saddle Ridge Farm business
    card. \r\n\r\nFor the Front:\r\n\r\nI removed the bottom divider to add more air
    to the design. The boarder has been simplified although I may go back to original.
    I also made the background lines diagonal. If you look at the new pdf's (c3 &
    c4) the colors are inconsistant but that's not my fault... Its an apple/adobe
    bug (I think.)\r\n\r\nI adjusted the letter spacing 'SADDLE'- made the 'addle'
    closer to the 's'. I increased the letter spacing in 'Quality Boarding by'.\r\n\r\nOh
    and another serious deal... I added old style figures to the design. And apperently
    these do not work as expected and I'm not really happy as I has to manually adjust
    every single number. I probably will have to go back to using lining figures.
    Didot is a very old font- why they have not fixed it is beyond my comprehension.\r\n\r\nFOR
    THE BACK:\r\n\r\nI ghosted the image of the logo in the background and I used
    OSF figures and MANUALLY corrected them >:-/ I added more space to \"Saddle Ridge
    Farm\".\r\n\r\nI have yet pin down the exact pantone yet but that's in the works.
    As the paper, its going to be somewhere between natural and warm cream.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for new suggestions,\r\n\r\nMikey "

  body: "The diagonal stripes feel a bit hard-edged and garish. Consider getting rid
    of the black diagonal lines and using tweaking the greens so that they're closer
    to each other in hue and lightness -- more of a tone-on-tone approach. Or screen
    the black so that you end up with a grey that's the same lightness as your greens.\r\n\r\nNot
    crazy about the client's name in all caps and italics. But if you want to use
    that approach, consider making the type smaller and looser."

  body: "MarcoX: Hello and thanks for the feedback. I don't exactly get what you mean
    by a 'tone on tone' approach. As for screening the black diagonals- I don't think
    that's a good idea because that would created {ugly} half-tone dots. I did make
    a card without the black diagonals though.\r\n\r\nAlso would it be better if the
    diagonals were vertical instead? As in 'space tweak 1.pdf'\r\n\r\nYou are right
    about the spacing of the clients name. Although I do like italic but there is
    something wrong with 'stucture' of the bottom half of the card. I can't put my
    finger on it.\r\n\r\nOh and by the way is it better to have:\r\n\r\nfull board,\r\npartial
    board,\r\npasture board\r\n& retirees\r\n\r\nor should it be:\r\n\r\nfull, partial,
    & pasture board\r\nplus retirees\r\n\r\nThanks for the input,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz"
