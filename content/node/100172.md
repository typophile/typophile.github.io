body: Is there any research regarding the use of Title Case in headlines? I am currently
  doing work for  a company that uses title case throughout its web site, on all headlines
  and subheads, and I find it unnecessary and more difficult to read than sentence
  case. I especially think that title case is not necessary when it's a complete sentence.
  But that's just my opinion. Thanks!
