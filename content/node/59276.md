  A wide range of weights, too.\r\n\r\nFor example: I think of FF Kievit as a contemporary
  version of Helvetica...a bit more geometric than Helvetica but similar in functionality
  and feel."

  body: "In my eyes, Kievit is quite far from Helvetica. I wouldn't say it's more
    geometric neither. Kievit is a <em>humanist</em>, Helvetica a <em>neo grotesque</em>.
    \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for another <em>geometric slab serif</em> (like Lubalin
    Graph), maybe you'll like Rockwell or Register Serif BTN.\r\n\r\nIf you want a
    more humanist touch to your slab, take a look at Archer, Serifa and PNM Caecilia.
    Those are some of my favourites. Actually, Archer take cues from both geometric
    and humanist designs, and might be just what you're looking for.\r\n"

    of Archer, in [[http://typography.com/ask/index.php|this talk]] by Hoefler and
    Frere-Jones. The first half is Jonathan Hoefler arguing that revivals are dead,
    and then the second half has Frere-Jones talking about Archer and Escrow, their
    Wall Street Journal text face. \r\n\r\nFrere-Jones by the way really hates Lubalin
    Graph, and the strict geometric slabs in general, which he says \"just die on
