  body: I would very much like to go but the $600 price tag is a bit much for this
    particular unemployed individual. It is kinda nice though being only an hour away
    from my place of residence. <BR> <BR>Have you folks gone in the past? Worthwhile?  <BR>

  body: Not that I&#39;m bitter or anything, but my movie wasn&#39;t selected even
    as a finalist in their stupid, worthless little Flash &#34;film&#34; festival,
    so I say, screw &#39;em. Oh, and I can&#39;t afford $600 for a conference, either.

    it Flashdance.

  body: Haha! <BR> <BR>By the way, speaking of &#39;our own little independent Flash  <BR>film
    festival&#39; stay tuned for more details about the free  <BR>Typophile gathering
    slated for Saturday, 26 April in the SF <BR>Bay area.  <BR> <BR>Start prepping
    your typo-centric films/videos/animations.  <BR> <BR>Cheshire, you better plan
    on showing your piece there. &#40;Oh, <BR>and you&#39;re a winner in my book.&#41;

  body: That&#39;s fantastic -- that&#39;s one weekend out of the next couple of months
    that I&#39;m actually in town and without plans! I guess that would be a good
    deadline for me to make a trailer for the next movie. And thanks, Joe.
