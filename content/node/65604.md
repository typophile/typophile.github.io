  copy for this annual report in Underware's Dolly. Love the font it has been working
  out great, but as far as I can see it does not have any tabular numerals. We are
  very late in the game here with this project and the client has just asked for the
  some of the numerals to be \"bigger\" but they really mean that they want them to
  be tabular. It is looking like we will need to swap out some of the numerals for
  a different font (not ideal believe me) and I was wondering if anyone had some suggestions
  of a font that we could use its numerals and they would not stand out TOO much.
  Any help is much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Underware directly! I seem to remember that they have designed some. Other options:
    1: Gingko is so similar one of our fellow Typophiles called it a rip-off, and
    it has the numerals you are after. 2: Have me draw some! 3: Explain to your client
    old style figures are designed to work in text setting, and lining figures only
    really belong with capitals.\r\n"

    makes you so sure? I just checked and can't see any tabular nums in there either.
    And since this is for an annual report, tabular nums might very well be needed
    (although I don't get the \xABbigger\xBB comment).\r\n\r\nI'd contact Underware
    \u2013 making tabular numerals from existing proportional ones is <em>really</em>
    not a big deal."

    cap height.
