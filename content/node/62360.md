  body: "It sure looks like a font was used, but I can't say it looks like anything
    I can recall. The leaf-shaped swash terminals should be good earmarks. It could
    be a custom font designed for the stationer (in order to prevent desktop customer
    end-runs to save money).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
