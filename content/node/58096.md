body: "A recurring topic that Eben Sorkin has been bringing up is the variation of
  letters within body text faces, something that today doesn't seem to happen as much.\r\n\r\nWhile
  I was working to put in the ligatureless ligatures, I also started playing around
  with some other variants.  In my Coru\xF1a, the f and j have extremely long descenders
  that can occasionally collide or can make a space look like it's not really a space.
  \ Kerning almost always looks wrong, so in these cases, the letters automatically
  close up into a more compact form.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/corunna_subs_5677.png]\r\nIn
  the above example, the first line shows words where the long ascender/descender
  of the f, y, and j don't get in the way.  The second line they clearly do, and the
  third line compacts them.\r\n\r\nWhat are some other subtle substitutions y'all've
  seen either in older fonts or modern digital ones?"

  body: I've followed Eben's research into these kind of variations in (renaissance)
    typefaces with great interest. So therefore I also think it's a good thing if
    people try to capture this concept in modern digital typefaces. :)

    the umlaut among many others.  I just finished a more or less final (less kerning)
    version of Coru\xF1a Regular, and its OpenType tables look more like a complex
    handwriting font."
