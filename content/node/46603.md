  to design for myself. I was thinking of something funky, round, sporty. Maybe similar
  to the Coroflot logo (www.coroflot.com). Icon concepts attached.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  ANY suggestions.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dp-logo_4706.gif]"

  body: The above two made me think about VAG Rounded or any rounded version of Univers
    or Helvetica. While the bottom three seem to invite a geometrical font as Futora
    or Avant Garde (never thought I would recommend those :) or a modern open sans
    like maybe Scala Sans.

    I think something with a consistent stroke thickness like Bauhaus, lubalingraph,
    insignia, \u2026\r\n\r\nor maybe helvetica\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions. "
