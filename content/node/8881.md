body: This logo is for a local steel working/manufacturing company. They do engineering,
  machining, die making, yadda yadda yadda... <BR> <BR>All of their marketing pieces
  thus far are just bad. You look at it and immediately you know their office has
  dark brown plywood paneling just  from the look of it. anyway - we are trying to
  move them to a more sophisticated look. We are getting ready to produce a catalog
  for them and are trying to sell them on a new identity. Below is my first finished
  stab - will probably comp out 1 or two more... Any ideas or reactions? <BR> <BR>You
  can see the old and scary at <a href="http://www.jrhoe.com" target="_blank">www.jrhoe.com</a><img

  body: Well you certainly can&#39;t do any worse than what they had. <BR> <BR>Your
    graphic is interesting. To be honest, I didn&#39;t see the &#34;H&#34; for the
    first 10-15 sec, but now I can&#39;t see anything else. I wonder if there is a
    way to emphasize the &#34;H&#34; without ruining the sophisticated subtlety you&#39;ve
    accomplished. It&#39;s neat, but I think 10-15 sec is a long time to figure it
    out. Maybe I&#39;m just an idiot. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll bet you can find more interesting
    logotype. Perhaps something more substantial. Those boxes &#40;metal sheets, or
    whatever&#41; create a pretty strong graphic, with a heavy &#34;H&#34; contained
    within, while that logotype seems really weak in comparison &#40;style, weight
    and color&#41;. The type also seems disjointed from the logo. I would say to either
    make the type heavier and make it interact more with the graphic or make it much
    smaller, as a contrasting complimentary element to the graphic. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: The mark seems overy complex. What if you just distill it down to the H reversed
    out of the box &#40;forming the I-beam&#41;?

  body: '&#62;Hugh, maybe you could make the cubes smaller without making the H smaller?  <BR>
    <BR>I also find the type a bit weak. Maybe something more graphic and with an
    interesting ampersand? <BR>Maybe something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/teuton/normal-bold/testdrive.html?s=J.R.+Hoe+%26+Sons&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Teuton </a>'

  body: I&#39;ll play with the type later - but just wanted to comment - the H in
    the middle was &#34;accidental&#34; I had the structure in place when I saw it
    and clipped one more path then I originally had designed and the H was there.
    It is supposed to refer more to the structural and engineering components as well
    as sheets of steel being molded or manufactured the H is I guess just an easter
    egg. I agree that the type is somewhat lackluster, but not sure how far I can
    really go before it competes with the symbol - I like teuton - I also like Scotts
    suggestion of maybe even going smaller - I don&#39;t  really think that I want
    the two to really &#34;interact&#34; per se I want to keep them in seperate zones
    &#40;rambling off the top of my head I really need to think about it&#41; thanks
    for the suggestions so far guys!!!

    body: "I n ever updated this - They asked me to more specifically show a forge
      (since they are the only remaining forge left in KY) By following the link above
      you can see a VERSION of the logo (though not in the best iteration I would
      say. Not sure who did the web work - I think it was someone in house at the
      company. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot the strongest work but it beats what they had -
      which you can no longer see - and the client is pleased as punch.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HoeLogo_6564.jpg]"
