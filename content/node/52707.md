body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nHope you're all well. I'm currently in the process of launching
  a unique idea I have had over the last six months for an online digital type foundry.
  I can't go into details as yet, but it will be something special.\r\n\r\nThe reason
  I am posting, is to gain as much advice as possible. I have been collecting quotes
  for an online self maintained full cms backend and front end digital type store
  from a range of companies. Some of the quotes are in to the tens of thousands of
  pounds which I currently can't really afford to invest in this.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  to build a store with great user friendly content and access similar to the likes
  of T26, with the above features also.\r\n\r\nCan anyone give me any advice on this,
  whether you know of a suprb CMS freelancer, a company, or anyone who can take my
  designs and my idea and turn them into a reality for a reasonable budget?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAlex."
