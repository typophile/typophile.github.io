    Foundation website, downloaded a PDF that contained the same font, and opened
    a page in Illustrator to zero-in on the tyepface).\r\n\r\nZeCraft/Jean Fran\xE7ois
    Porchez did the custom lettering on the company's logo; perhaps they did the typeface
    as well:\r\nhttp://www.zecraft.com/lettering/kering\r\n\r\nI'm pulling a high-res
    sample from the PDF now and will search to see if there are any comparables out
    there...."

    to his list. BTW, Kevin, would really like to have a look to 'Kering' typeface.
    Would you mind sharing the link to the PDF you've inspected? Thanks in advance
    :)\r\nStrangely, Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez got no credit for the [[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/kering_goes_owl_out_with_new_branding.php|Pinault
    Printemps Redoute rebranding]] (former name of Kering).\r\n\r\nEDIT: thanks, Kevin
    :) Already downloaded this one but haven't seen anywhere... Will have a second
    look for sure... Thanks again."
