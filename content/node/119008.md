  body: Not Vinter*, which is close, I think these glyphs may just have been done
    in Illustrator as a one off for this project. *(Vinter's D thins out at top and
    bottom and is fat in middle)

  body: "This is an exercise using \"inverted contrast\" or \"reverse contrast\" that
    is found in a few fonts, but in less extreme form. \r\nTake a look at Signo [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SignoThin_OD_3536.gif]http://ilovetypography.com/2014/02/14/making-signo-fonts/
    and http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/r-type/signo/\r\nThe best known reverse contrast
    font is Antique Olive [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AntiqueOliveLight_OD_4038.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/antique-olive/\r\nIt's a 19th century idea,
    used for many of the fonts we now call \"Western\" such as Adrian Frutiger's Westside
    \r\nDon[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Westside_OD_4083.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/westside/

  body: "Bob, of course it isn\u2019t Vinter (wrong stress on |O| too, by the way).
    I was suggesting \u201Ca similar font\u201D, as per request, and I think Vinter
    has a similar feel, while being a proper typeface instead of some vector shapes
    badly thrown around ;-)"
