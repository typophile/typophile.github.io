body: Hello. I write a newsletter. I create my newsletter in Word and convert to a
  PDF.  I&#39;d like to use a slightly different font than the standard options available
  in Word.  I&#39;ve found one I like, but I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called.
  Can anyone help?   <BR> <BR>Much thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35493.png"

  body: This looks like Adobe Serif MM, a multiple master font that&#39;s substitued
    for serif fonts in PDFs when they are not available for some reason. Acrobat will
    create instances of the multiple master that approximate the metrics of the original
    font used.
