  to my mess..and you are kind of my last hope, as my dead line is in about 5-6 hours...\r\n\r\nthe
  situation:\r\ni have .doc files, with [[cyrillic]] text (macedonian if it matters),
  the font used for displaying is MAC C TIMES...the problem is that i desperately
  need it preferrebly in myriad pro light condensed cyr (i guess this exists) or some
  other condensed font\r\n(i'm on windows xp, indesign cs2)\r\n\r\nwhenever i select
  the text and choose another cyr font (minion pro cyr for instance), it converts
  the cyr characters to latin with some errors...\r\n\r\nso, what could i possibly
  try so that i can select the text, choose a variant of myriad pro cyr...and the
  letters stay cyrillic?\r\nor is there any other way to get things done? find/replace
  maybe?\r\n\r\ni have used fontlab for some basic stuff..so if you have a suggestion,
  please consider writing at least a small hint on where the settings/options are
  where i'd have to be careful..\r\n\r\nplease if you're reading this and have the
  slightest clue...consider sharing it, i really need this one badly..\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance..."

  body: "So, your problem is that your original font and text are likely MacCyrillic.
    Meanwhile InDesign (both platforms), Windows, Myriad Pro, and newer Mac OSes are
    all using Unicode.\r\n\r\nSo, go to that \"Universal Cyrillic Decoder\" and tell
    it the source text is \"maccyrillic\" and you want it as Unicode.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
