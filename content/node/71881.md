  They both appear on Australian websites (if that helps in the identification).\r\n\r\nI've
  tried \"indentifont\", \"what the font\" and Font Shop's \"Type Navigator\" with
  no success. I don't think it's custom as it appears in both of these unrelated logos.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: 'I tested it and it must be Myriad. Thanks Ryuk. I''m using Myriad Pro and
    with the alterations it looks pretty close for the oxygene logo. I think the biome
    logo is a different typeface again, just with the same customisation. Thanks for
    your help. '

  body: The more I look at "biome", the more I think it's a modified [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/|Futura]]
    and the tagline looks to be set in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/gill-sans/|Gill
    Sans]]...
