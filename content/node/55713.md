  stuff- logotype, colourways, promo material, blah blah blah. However the client
  would also like to be able to create an individual name tag/ID card for the kids.
  It doesn't need to have a photo, but they want to be able to easily make one themselves
  each time they get a new batch of kids join the club. They want me to design a template
  that can easily be used to put the info in. \r\n\r\nWhat is the best way round this?
  Obviously they arent going to have InDesign or anything like that, so whats the
  best method of doing it? Anyway to make it useable in Word, without having to design
  it in that? Or any other solutions, beyond sending them a image in a word document,
  and getting them to put a text box over it? :/\r\n\r\nI'm also going to have to
  spec a slightly different typeface for this, as I doubt they are going to have Akzidenz
  Grotesk avaliable...."

    the photos change too?"

    them makes it a tad easier. They may want some ones with photos for the staff,
    but they can be done at a later date. \r\n\r\nHow would this hypothetical app
    work? Maybe I need to get a slightly more tech savvy friend in on this one..."

    you could make the template as a PDF and they can just input the names.\r\n\r\n<a
