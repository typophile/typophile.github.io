body: okay, so i'm not a techno wizard, but i've been able to figger out how to program
  some of the most basic OT features in FontLab such as ligatures, small caps, salt
  - all of the fairly straight forward replacement schemes. the [[frac]] (fractions)
  feature seems a little more involved than that and i'm wondering how to best set
  it up. it seems that other fonts convert all the numbers to numerators, then the
  slash sign to the fraction bar and any numbers directly following become denominator
  digits. is this the best way to set up this feature? does anyone feel like walking
  me through this one? just thought i'd ask.
