  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm currently working on the arabic block of my font and since I don't speak, read nor write arabic language(s), I suddently felt concerned about the design.
I know the way it is written and how glyphs join, etc., give meaning to the words and phrases but, if I take some liberties when drawing the glyphs, could it result in something offensive? Something that could enrage the people using that language? I feel worried about it, very very worried. I mean no disrespect. I never would! That's unthinkable to me! So, if I flatten a curve a little or round it a bit more for it to fit the general design of this font, could it result in something awful? Please help!
This is the first time I try to fill all the blocks of a font and my font has no 45° angles. No straight lines at 45° angles. So I round some segments a little, or straighten them. Could this be a problem for the nature of arabic calligraphy?
Thanks in advance.</div>

The larger medial black and white image should have a small straight line over the diacritic mark as in the other two images though it is not necessary but it will make the word shaping perfect and you will observe the same shaping in almost all Arabic fonts. Yes, in the same medial image, the second diacritic like shape is not necessary as it is also not present in the other images. It is not a mark, but the isolated shape of the same last letter of the word, above which it is made. You may use it or remove it according to the need of design.

Zuhair Albazi: Thank you for your comments! I thought of that second form because I saw this pic:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/396px-Dcp7323-Edirne-Eski_Camii_Allah_3889.jpg]
and I liked it. I might include it as an alternate. For the time being I think I'll include the one shown in the small magenta tile as default.

Thank you both for being so understanding and kind!</div>

1. The digits are shown with the urdu language and with the 'locl' feature activated. The locl feature is as follows*:
<code>feature locl { # Localized Forms
 script arab; # Arabic
 language URD  exclude_dflt; # Urdu
lookupflag RightToLeft;
    sub [afii57396 afii57397 afii57399 uni06F4] by [uniE864 uni06F5 uniE867 uniE864];
    sub [uni06F6 uni06F7] by [afii57398 uniE867];
 language FAR  exclude_dflt; # Farsi
lookupflag RightToLeft;
    sub [afii57396 afii57397 afii57398] by [uni06F4 uni06F5 uni06F6];
} locl;</code>
For the number sequences you mention, I took this pic but I think it doesn't fit in the thread. Anyway, here it is:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arab sample_6394.jpg]
2. Heh's petals** are spiky because... I dunno. I made it like that with no knowledge about how it should be drawn. Um... is it better if I draw it like the final form? I included an 'a' next to a heh in the image.
3. That's a triple غ to test the 'init', 'medi' and 'fina' features. I included a triple ف for comparison.

:( I hope it's just a matter of corrections and I hadn't offended anyone. I apologize in advance.
___________
* I must admit I copied this feature from another font as I'm not familiar with arabic, as I mentioned before.
** I asume 'petal' means the form of the heh. Oh God, I am so ignorant in this matter. :(</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Why would anyone be offended? Designing a typeface for a writing system you don't read regularly if is not impossible, is not easy. Personally I think some of the numbers are illegible like «۳» and «۲». The loop in medial and final variations of letter «غ» are very similar to the letter «ف» and could be easily mistaken by each other. I didn't want to comment because the style doesn't attract me, but hey, that's just me. :) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you, Bahman Eslami. Please tell me, how can I make legible those numbers? Should I make the superior arcs larger? I mean, those that look like a small 'w' and 'u' to me? You are right on the loops of those letters (غ and ف) and I'll do corrections to them. I started doing this typeface because of the latin portion, of course. I just wanted to include more unicode ranges so more people could use it, should they like the style.

Now let me preach my usual sermon:  More than half of the Arabic letters rely on dots to differentiate them from others with a similar base outline.  In my own fonts, and despite some early criticism,  I use larger-than-usual dots, and for the sake of legibility would advise Aristarco to double the size of the dots in his nice-looking font! The very large zero dot in the numerals is necessary for the same reason, but the letter dots can be a bit smaller.

I do the same in Latin! And when another type designer says "your tittle is slightly too large", I know I've done it right. :->  The "i" needs all the help it can get. Now, if we could only help the village idiot that is the lc "el"...

		<div class="commentbody">Well, unlike words, shapes very rarely have literal meanings (especially letterforms, which are "reserved" for sense-free atoms) so it would be very hard for you to call somebody a whore with a font...

On the other hand, here's a true story: I once opined –on a private discussion forum– that a fellow list-member who was making an old-fashioned Arabic font was holding back Arabs. This was around when Pim Fortuyn* –an anti-Islam figure– was assassinated... So I got an email from the list administrator that I was endangering that guy's life, and was expelled from the forum! But 27 emails of support later I was let back in.

As for the bigger dots, I made them bigger but a bit smaller than a zero dot. My zero dot is 130pt and the old dots were 50pt, so I made them 80pt. This is a test. They look... a bit too big, don't they? Mmh...

Good one hrant - negative space as a political statement!  
The new dots do not look too big to me at all - look at my logo where the dot on the Dad is a bit too big.  As you know in classical calligraphy the dot is a square drawn with the slant of  the nib.  Here is my study of how a 45 degree nib would produce a square dot, and how circling the square (!) would result in a choice of circles. I chose the largest whose diameter is double the line width. Legibility would demand an even bigger circle than that. And if the slant is more than 45 degrees the circumscribed circle would be larger still compared to the verticals, but nearer the horizontal width.

Nice anthropomorphic type advice: nose, child, mother. That kaf is lovely.
I used the circle-square-triangle scheme in an unreleased display font project - its a decorative idea and relates to the ruq'a script 'dots' where a dot, a line and and two lines connected at an angle have the same function.
The only problem with an unfilled circle for a dot is when the font has diacritical marks where the sukun mark is also a circle.</div>

@ I do not think anybody is going to use diacritics  with StarCoRoundAlphabet. It is more decorative than functional. Anyhow:
1. Sukun can be made like (>) as in http://typophile.com/node/115169

One question: I've seen the Arabic Presentation Forms A has 611 code points, most of them ligatures. Is this block heavily required? I really feel it'd take an eternity to fill, heheh. I'd like to know if it is quite necessary so I better get started. Also I have to code the subs for all those ligatures. Are they really used? I've already made all the initial, medial, final and isolated glyphs of this block, except for the ligatures. Well, I did FDF2 only.</div>

Cursive flow of Arabic line, whether traditional or modern,  gives each word an individual unique shape, much more so than in Latin type, for example.

Arabic does indeed have a readability advantage over Latin (although its <em>legibility</em> is lower), and ligation is part of that. But calligraphic flow now impedes the ideal progress of Arabic.

Yes, I started this font as a decorative one. In fact, I've been testing time and time again and found it works best at sizes 32pt and up. I just wanted to make it more... "complete" than the average free-fonts you find in the interwebs.

But my ideas of typographic progress –in any script– have been maturing for almost twenty years, and I'm now very sure that marking the black pulls towards form and away from function; calligraphy creates beautiful men and women that you shouldn't marry.

Sadly I'm notoriously prone to favoring ideas over production, so I can't actually show anything.... yet. It seems I'm waiting for something to change in my life. I hope that doesn't mean all my kids leaving home, because that's at least 14 years away!  :-/

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks I lived in Beirut in the 60's and 'modern' typography was non-existant then, and I had definite ideas where it should be heading - a sans-serif sort of generic font to start with (hence my AlQuds lettering and now fonts).  The sans-serification of scripts all over the world is a real phenomena and a good one and it happened to Japanese, Thai, etc. Since then a whole generation of typographers were educated also in Beirut, (cutting and pasting Latin letters as I heard to create Arabic letters as a design excercise).  So a sort of Latinized Arabic with little regard for what I consider the traditional essence of the letter shapes is now fashionable. The result are now elegant professional fonts where the letter shapes are too much alike the medial ha same as the dal for example.

Anyway what is "marking the black" ?  Congratulations on a home full of young kids - that is the best!  And as my daughter keeps telling me "be responsible for your actions" so it is up to to you to change enough to apply your ideas. Good luck!</div>

"Marking the black" is my way of referring to rendering the bodies of the letters as opposed to the rendering the black/white border (although sometimes the former poses as the latter). To me the white cannot fully take part in the act of reading when marking the black, no matter how sensitively it's done.

Yes, I do need to change, instead of wait.

How is the situatuon in Armenian in which the letters are not connected? I find it remarkable that  the Armenian alphabet was invented by one priest from scratch, if I remember correctly, rather than develop incrementally. And he did not choose to imitate Greek or Latin!

Hmm I can understand the concept of letter shape and the negative shape (the background). But how can you change the 'black' without changing the border?  Doesn't the outline define the body and vice versa in complementary ways?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">An inflated "tooth" area (which I call "x-height envy" :-) and reduction of shape variations are two big symptoms of the disease of Latinized Arabic, but there are others... The good news is that when Arabic is Latinized it's usually very obvious, hence easy to combat; Armenian is much closer to Latin in many ways, so the damage is less but it's also harder to fight... The two big symptoms are an inflated "x-height" and too many serifs.

Concerning the invention of Armenian, the only formal account we have comes from Mesrop Mashdots's star student, Goryune (which BTW is the name my wife and I gave our middle son :-) but he's relatively clear: Mashdots was commissioned by King Vramshabouh (oh, our youngest son's name is Vram :-) to invent the alphabet in order to combat cultural assimilation. This is why Mashdots did not base the Armenian alphabet on existing scripts. However the scribes who ended up writing in the new script were used to Greek, so they made it more like Greek. But, a caveat: I wasn't there.

The reason marking the black cannot yield an optimal black/white relationship is that it forces a relationship between the two edges of the black; so no matter how much you want to respect the white, you cannot do so optimally. The parallel I like to draw is with Jefferson and Sally Hemmings: he loved her, but she was still a slave.

That is great you gave your sons historical names related to Armenian script! May they carry the tradition so far from Ararat!  Apologies to  Aristarco for monopolising his page for a private conversation!

I think I get what you are saying... the background is unimportant compared to the actual letter shape...but the background becomes more important as the font gets fatter and takes up most of the space!

On the other hand, and especially for diasporans (something Armenians for one have more than they have "natives") sticking to precedent is just as dangerous because it makes the younger generation –our future– see their mother script as a museum item.

<blockquote>people are generally lazy and do not make the effort to see critically...</blockquote>

I don't mind when laymen are "lazy" – in a way that's what makes text face design so interesting in fact; it's when type designers ignore the problem –or even celebrate it– that I get upset.

What!? No! I'm learning a lot, A LOT from this conversation. And I'm avid of learning as I've always been. I've always loved typography but, as an engineer, I had paid little attention to the process of creation and origins. When I started working on an electronic display, I wanted to make something beyond the common 7-segment or 16-segment display and didn't want to go the dot-matrix way. I imagined a more "designed display" to show numbers with more quality, yet keeping the 16-segment approach, and so StarCo Round started to form in my mind. When I started the font I wanted to learn more about typography and here I am, trying to absorb every detail and all the data I can. So interesting and fascinating! And reading your posts helps me in that search for knowledge. So, no apologies needed! Au contraire, thank you for sharing your thoughts!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">"x-height envy", good term. Maybe this approach in Arabic script to enlarge everything in the middle to mimic texture of Latin script is wearing off. If anyone is so interested in Latin latter shapes that they want emulate it in Arabic script why would they want to design in arabic, they could relinquish it for Latin. They can express this passion in Latin script and never look back. I would say please leave this script alone!
Today the problem is that this Latinized Arabic has become so ubiquitous that the damage is probably is too big to be fixed. I can see it everywhere and it's because of the market. It seems that arab clients want more western appearance than original or arabic appearance. If they want it to look original, they use calligraphy which is corny and if they want it to look modern they use this Latinized Arabic style. Maybe first culture should be changed before typefaces!

Type design is part of culture of course. But those clients you mention don't want culture, they just want the money. So we have a responsibility to bring money down from its throne and change culture via our typefaces. And not only by making better typefaces, but by convincing our users that it's a good idea.

		<div class="commentbody">@Bahman Eslami - I live in Japan so only see those x-rated Arabic fonts only through images.  However I notice the damage seems to be limited to display fonts, advertising and so forth. For body text it seems the norm is the good old naskh-type fonts variations.  That is lucky for me because soon I will be releasing my AlQuds OT families that look 'modern' while retaining the essential generic shapes gleaned from many styles of calligraphy, children's writing and my own design sense hopefully a font to be read rather than flout its own fancy features.

@hrant - your "tooth height x-height envy" literally saved my fonts from being long in the tooth! Over the years I started increasing the tooth height without realizing it. After reading your phrase I spent the day doing dental work on those dot-supporting 'teeth' to shorten the verticals - so thanks.

@AzizMostafa  cultures definitely do interbreed - and the strong ones learn from others while retaining their own personality. That Mei Hei font is one of so many other fonts trying to mimick scripts of other languages - for example a Latin alphabet made up of Arabic letter forms is ridiculous at worst and too exotic at best. 
By the way when is Maryam Soft going to have its website in Arabic so that we can see what you are up to - if indeed you are associated with that software? I once tried to install a trial version but Windows rejected it for some reason. BTW is there a way to learn more about what is going on in Arabic modern fonts in countriues like Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia ? 

@Aristocrato  glad you are enjoying the conversation! I once designed for a manufacturer an electronic display for indic numerals ١ ٢ ٣ ٤ ٥ ٦ ٧ ٨ ٩ ٠ using a small number of shapes - just as those 1980's style displays showed Arabic numerals 1234567890 with a few vertical and horizontal lines - but I guess the idea was never in demand.  Now even in printing and other Arabic texts "Arabic" numerals in their incongruent Latin form are dotting Arabic texts while the beautifully designed Indic numerals that developed with the script to match are becoming relics. Disaster!

Vladimir: I have never seen an electronic display showing indic numerals. That sounds awesome!! Mine was intended for a weather system I did for my thesis. Here it is the "inception" of StarCo Round:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Round evolution Small_5252.jpg]
I must admit I am very intrigued by your display for indic numerals. Mine was an idea I presented to the jury: why do electronic displays have to look ugly? why not make a display with graphic design as basis, instead of just showing information, but keeping it efficient from the electronics point of view? I hope one day to see it manufactured with an exotic technique like neon tubes. :)

I've been busy at my job but in the free times I can get, I do minor changes. I know it still has its details but I managed to enlarge the dots and give space to some letters. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArabicTestSmall_6520.jpg]
So, I assume the neckless final form that was mentioned is for the letter I marked in blue? I'll think of it. I must admit, the larger dots look way better!</div>

Pity I really like them.
Your display numerals are nice the 5 is a bit confusing at first because it looks like an inverted 2.  The ones I was referring to are 7-segment (not 8!, a mental slip because when they are all lit it shows 8) LCD displays.  Here is a variation I found on Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sixteen-segment_display_animated.gif

I like your final yeh swan shape. I think you will find that words with repeated dots will cause overlap id you retain the wide separation of the 2 dots in the medial teh .

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Round 2-5 evolution Small_5962.jpg]
The 16-segment alphanumeric display, like that shown on wikipedia's gif is exactly why I wanted to change to a more stylized design. In real life the 16-segment display makes some letters look ugly because it's physically difficult to make the segments touch completely in points where many are touching, like the center of the star. So letters like X, W, V, etc., look confusing.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letter X_6648.jpg]
So, following the likes of Nixie tubes, I thought of the numerals you see keeping the 16-segment count but with a nicer appearance. After the project I couldn't help thinking an entire font could be made with this style and I started StarCo Round.
Yes, I've seen the dots are overlapping and I will adjust to avoid it. I'd like to understand how much space should exist between letters in arabic and although I've spaced the Alif and Lam-Alif ligature to make it more readable, I haven't found how much space give between other letters. But I keep reading about it :)</div>

As explained here: http://typophile.com/node/46166#comment-284067
1. Kill the spaces to the right of all.
2. Kill the spaces to the left of R and its dotted twin (Z).
3. Left Space the rest of the  letters (Lam-Alif ligature, D @  its dotted twin) to the narrowest between )(.
