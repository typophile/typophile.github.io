    I love the sport).\r\n\r\nAnd to add to that: hockey past May. Snows gone = hockey
    should be gone too. ;0)"

  body: "I only really care about College hockey and international hockey (especially
    the Olympics). My high school in Korea, Kyungbock High School, was a big hockey
    school as well.\r\n\r\nCongratulations to Boston College, by the way, on the Frozen
    Four title. The balance of power in college hockey may be west-leaning, but BC
    are the closest thing to a dynasty these days.\r\n\r\nMy alma mater, Harvard,
    just missed out on making the NCAAs this year after turning around a disappointing
    season (and pushing BC to extra periods in the Beanpot title game, too). It's
    sad to think that this year's team was the last to include guys that were there
    when I was still a student."
