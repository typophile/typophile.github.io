<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>we are involved in the rebranding of romania's seventh IT company and we have analysed so far rebranding programmes for IT companies. almost all of them go for the logotype solution. <br> <br>so, we tried to develop a logotype based on the visual personality of the old logo, in an attempt to preserve some brand equity. I wanted to ask all the great type designers on this forums where they get theit inspiration from. <br> <br>how do you start working on a logotype? <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12809.gif alt=comparison> <br> <br>is the solution we came up with acceptable from the type pont of view? thank you all so much .... <br> <br>PS: there is another thing bothering me now: brand's verbal distinctiveness lies in its "X", but this letter evolved into a visual cliche. what's left to be done?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't like to be rude, but maybe you should really think again about the concept of that double line in x letter. It is not just that it is a visual cliche, that cliche is also a bit dated and could even cause difficulties with legal protection in many countries. <br> <br>> how do you start working on a logotype? <br> <br>Mostly the same way you did. What you did could be one of the schetches, but maybe you have to look for more solutions and than choose the one with no obvious problems like 'visual cliche'. <br> <br>In case you insist to present this logo, you will probably have to make vertical/horizontal optical correction. You should also consider the rythm of the logo which is broken (as Dmitry noticed) by the very wide and open D. It's counter is much larger than the ones in other letters. <br> <br>I hope that we will be able to follow the evolution of this logo soon. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>George told us in his post that Radix is "romania's seventh IT company." Therefore I would assume that they are involved in "information technologies" and process or manage some sort of information. <br> <br>Vague still, but probably not copiers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>yes I read that part. <br> <br>I'm talking like what kind of information and what kind of technology, what are the processing, managing - what's the difference between them and Nortel or Adobe or wotever. are they involve in HR tech, Telecom tech, bio tech, Security & Encryption, do they have products?, is this database engineering, archival? surveys? what!! information tech dosen't mean anything anymore - there's a human side to every company...what makes them important to have, hire, know about. <br> <br>"IT" is about ambiguous as "consultant" or "designer" for that matter <br> <br>Xerox the copy copany, is IT as far as my definition goes, they have a technology for information, they do understand themselves as IT however old school it is; but the common understanding is that they help you copy information. <br> <br>IT could also be the dewy decial system.</div>

<div class=commentbody>well, it seems I wasn't very specific with the details I have provided. Radix is involved in several field of IT. more can be found on <a href=http://www.radix.ro target=_blank>www.radix.ro</a>, their corporate website. <br> <br>as I have already mentioned, they decided to rebrand due to several factors, among which the high similarity of their symbol to that of one competitor, and the anniversary of 10 years of activity. the celebration will be held on July the 19th and all the work has to be done by that moment. they decided for a logotype that incorporates some design element that would preserve a part of the visual equity of the brand, that's why the whole process is rather hard to develop. <br> <br>I will be providing refinements made to the logotype as I develop them. <br> <br>thank you for your imputs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I got in...company history states: <br><i>Radix SRL is a Romanian IT company positioned as corporate solution provider. Our solutions consist in a complete line of hardware supplies, services and software solutions for imaging, enterprise information portals, document and knowledge management, database replication, fax/messaging for networks, WAP solutions, communication lines sharing, CAD/CAM. Powerful partnership inside Radix group of companies gives us a strong competitive edge and power to address most of the challenges in the Romanian IT market. <br> <br>Now we have two offices: in Bucharest and Iasi providing us a strong and effective distribution network for our solutions over all the country.

<div class=commentbody>To be honest, I think 'pharmaceuticals company/ product' when I see that logotype. <br> <br>"Radix: Breathe Easier" <br> <br>It's a heck of a lot better than the old one. The flat and rounded ends feel a bit odd to me, like they imply a moving line but one without a clear path (a data line perhaps?). It doesn't say much else to me, but it does it with more refinement than the old one.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Id not use LargeCaps with the Small, it destroys the line effect of the text. Also, imvhu, a bit more spacing might be good. <br> <br>It's strange to see that you build it in mm. I always use point when doing typo-heavy-stuff. These days I prefer a line grid in the back :-D. <br> <br>Logo... the flat and rounded end is a bit over the top, I agree, although it adds an individuality, especially as it returns in the paperdesign. Might be annoying, though, after some time :-) <br> <br>All in all much better than the previous ones. </div>

<div class=commentbody><i>mm = millimeters versus points.</i> <br>It is preference in units. The advantage I see in using points is a direct relationship between the layout measurment and the type measurement can be more precisely calculated.
