  first time posting.  I am currently starting a website redesign for a practice that
  deals with infertility.  From our first meeting, I gathered that their identity
  needs to appeal to both the more emotive side of couples trying to conceive while
  still being professional, scientific, modern etc.\r\n\r\nI was given the go ahead
  to ignore their current logo/identity (or lack there of) and there is possibility
  after the website launch to redesign their logo, stationary etc.  That said I want
  to start with a solid ground that could eventually turn into a logotype or set the
  tone of a new logo.  This site is very text heavy so it's only natural that I go
  for a typographic solution.  This is just a first go at selecting two typefaces
  for the company that I think look nice.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SJFC_3651.gif]\r\nTrajan
  Pro, Century Gothic\r\n\r\nSo please! Comments, ideas, suggestions.  I really want
  to explore all possible possibilities!"

    by slashing it to SJFC and design a graphic to go with it. Treat the full text
    as an optional tagline that can be handled for best fit. And don\u2019t use a
    classical serif\u2014your clients need to be giving prospective mothers warm fuzzies;
    the dour lawyer look just will not do."

  body: "I agree James and I have considered cutting down to SJFC.  I'm not considering
    this as a 71 character logo, just as a type treatment to help define the style
    of the rest of the site.  I'll give a go at exploring initials and see what appropriate
    typefaces I can come up with.  \r\n\r\nMy other concern is, the nurses at the
    practice want cute baby pictures plastered everywhere and the doctors want to
    talk about how cutting edge their technology and techniques are.  I'm having a
    hard time finding that healthy middle ground.\r\n\r\nI guess my first instinct
    was to go more dour, then soften it up with color..  Perhaps there's a clean friendly
    sans-serif to try?"

  body: "Baby pictures need to be present but limited. Obviously it\u2019s important
    to drive home the notion that the clinic produced babies, but you don\u2019t want
    to overdo it and make potential clients feel like failures for not having babies.
    As for the doctors and the tech\u2026it\u2019s unnecessary. People who want to
    have kids don\u2019t give a damn about the details and would gladly pay to be
    anally inseminated with dull acupuncture needles if it worked. Give the doctors
    a tech section to make them happy and keep it from overwhelming the entire site.
    \r\n\r\nAs for the font: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/\">Museo</a>
    gives you sans and serifs to work with. The humanist, almost geometric proportions
    give it a warmth that\u2019s appropriate as well."
