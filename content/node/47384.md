  is \u201CStelle\u201D is an italian word which means \u201CStars\u201D\r\nThe restaurant
  is all about mediterranean food and the owner told me that all the interior design
  will be very simple, using the typical elements of mediterranean look, like mosaics,
  wood floor, steel furniture, line patterns, a lot of white, clean spaces, etc.\r\n\r\nHe
  is inspired on a port city of Italy called \u201CPortofino\u201D (beautiful by the
  way), so there you will find beautiful bay, yacht, sea, etc\r\n(im just trying to
  get you in the context) :)\r\n\r\nIve been looking for pictures of this style and
  i already have a color palette, but im desperately searching for the right font
  type, i still dont know if i have to work with a handscript or sans serif or maybe
  a mix of them, or probably im totally wrong.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions is totally welcome!
  Please help :) "

    know what to expect from an italian restaurant with a logotype set in Frutiger.
    A chemistry laboratory instead of a kitchen probably.\r\n\r\nFeels like a down
    to earth typeface to me. Nothing fancy. Something with roots but new and fresh.\r\n\r\nHow
    about Nick Shinn\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/paradigm/\">Paradigm</a>
    with a venetian flavor?"

  body: "Simple interieur but classy, lively food, relaxing and smooth. That\u2019s
    what I see in your description. So I would go for a simple but lively typeface
    like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/\">Museo</a> by Jos
    Buivenga for example. \r\n\r\nOr if you like a more display-style I would go for
    the work of <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?savedSearch=2cca1fcdc4cb390e\">Jason
    Walcott</a>. Especially <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000058\">Luxury
    Royale</a> could fit fine IMHO. \r\n\r\nor if you like it in a more retro-style
    I\u2019d recommend the work of <a href=\"http://www.fontdiner.com/main.html\">Stuart
    Sandlers Fontdiner</a>. "

    line patterns and clean spaces. \r\n\r\nI am guessing you are speaking of a modern
    Mediterranean, similar to the way this restaurant is done in a modern Italian
    style. (The food is really good too.)\r\nhttp://biancoitalian.com/\r\n\r\n "
