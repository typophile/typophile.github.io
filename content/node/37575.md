    contacted veer.com but nobody...NOBODY seems to be able to locate this motif!
    Isn't that bizzare? Seriously, whoever can locate this hard to find motif is the
    real Motif GURU, period! ,-)"

  body: why is it so much harder to locate an ornament vs a type font?

  body: Because there's not much evidence to work with - basically you posted a shape
    and it's pretty hard to figure out an entire typeface based on just one shape
    and even more so when the shape isn't even a letter! Why not just recreate the
    shape by hand?

  body: "It looks like some of the ornaments from Bickham Script, but I didn't see
    this exact one. Another reason ornaments are so hard to ID is that they may not
    be shown in the font samples in font books, and some web sites don't show all
    embedded glyphs in a single Character Map.\r\n\r\nThe other problem is that there
    is not much way to know whether the particular ornament is hand-drawn or not.
    When there is only one of something shown, you have no way to know.\r\n\r\n -
