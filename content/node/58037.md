  the software had to crash before I had saved any of my work (and I had prepared
  extra-light versions of several other letters as well), but at least I now know
  how to interpolate. And I at least salvaged a screen-grab to prove it.\r\n\r\nThe
  heaviest <em>a</em> is from a grotesque I've been working on for the past few days.
  It's quite heavy, almost a demi-bold, so I wanted to know that I could produce lighter
  weights as needed by drawing an extra-light extreme and interpolating. I can probably
  do the same thing for darker weights. This, of course, isn't news to any of you
  type-design wizards, but it's the first time I've tried this thing, all right? Please
  carry on...\r\n\r\n"

    design comment. I don't think you need quite that much tapering in the extra-light
    master, at the lower join of the bowl to the vertical stem. Not saying you should
    get rid of it entirely, just reduce it a bit.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: You're right, that lower join is way too thin. I'll have to draw the extra-light
    master again anyway, and when I do so I'll be extra careful to keep the stroke
    thickness nice and even.

  body: "I agree with Thomas, a little less tapering on the light version would be
    good.\r\n\r\n<cite>I can probably do the same thing for darker weights.</cite>\r\n\r\nDo
    you mean interpolating intermediate weights? Yes, that's possible as well but
    you will find that it requires a little more reworking than in the lighter weights.\r\n\r\nNote
    that you can even generate the heavier weights from your light and regular using
    extrapolation (essentially the same as interpolation). Just enable extrapolation
    in the FontLab settings and drag the weight slider \"into the yellow\" and see
    what happens. Sometimes the results are more entertaining than useful but it's
    definitely worth a try."

  body: "Thanks, Tim. I do expect drawing the heavier weights to require a lot more
    reworking. Meanwhile, quick and dirty extrapolation from the light and regular
    masters for your amusement:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_extrapo_6168.gif]\r\n\r\nNot
    happy with the curves (I had to draw the extra-light again since I lost my previous
    work), but I can fix that later when I have the time. I think it makes sense to
    use an extrapolated bold weight as the basis for an extra-bold master. Lots of
    tweaking will be necessary, of course. Then I could interpolate the resulting
    master with the regular master to generate the intermediate weights. So I'll be
    using three masters (extra-light, regular, extra-bold) to generate all the weights
    in this scheme.\r\n\r\nJust how I'm going to find the time to do all that remains
    to be seen."

  body: "What you see is a strictly arithmetic progression (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).
    Of course, when it comes down to selecting a series of weights for a usable typeface,
    you would not want an arithmetic progression. You can see that the difference
    between the adjacent instances is much more noticeable in the lighter weights
    than in the darker weights. A geometric progression (e.g. 1, 1.6, 2.56, 4.096,
    ...) will yield a more usable range of weights, I reckon.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting
    to see what interpolating between the extremes of light and extra bold weights
    results in. Please let us know!"
