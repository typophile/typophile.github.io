  body: Very possible it was commissioned especially for Embarq. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=4&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=sanuk&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=Yellow+Pages">FF

  body: Now <em>that's</em> clever. Every foundry should have a dedicated user checking
    up regularly on the Type ID Board to point out their own typefaces. Handy! :^)

  body: "Thank you, very nice font btw. I did not expect to find the font. Just this
    morning prior to reading this, I did investigative work and found a pdf at the
    embarq site and the pdf properties dialog box said 2 fonts were used, Embarq light
    and Embarq bold. So I figured it was a commissioned font as previously mentioned.\r\n"
