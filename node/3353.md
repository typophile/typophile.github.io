body: 'hi. i&#39;m a student working on a poster series about women&#39;s roles as
  seen through advertising. although women have gained equality in the workplace since
  the 1950s, ads today are targeted towards women for &#34;traditional&#34; roles
  they still supposed to play. i&#39;ve included 2 initial concepts for this series,
  and i want to  show how not much has changed between now and 50 years ago, as far
  as gender-dictated roles in the household go. i&#39;m having some trouble finding
  images &#40;i will be photographing the actual products&#41;. does anyone know where
  to find good images? also any suggestions for composition...how to integrate the
  type better? how can i make these stronger? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27420.gif"

  body: 'Hi Allison, <BR> <BR>The layout is looking fake retro. Immerse yourself in
    real retro advertising to get a sense of how the different tools and printing
    affected the layouts. The look is often not as clean as you have going. Simple
    yes, but clean no. Part of this is the fonts. Try the copy in futura bold, Draw
    it up how you want it. Print each piece, image, type etc. Scan them back in and
    hand composite in photoshop. Also, use real quotes! Here are links to layouts:

  body: '<a href="http://fontdiner.com">Font Diner</a> not only has great fonts for
    you, he&#39;s got a &#34;Homemade Specialties&#34; section. You can find some
    real inspiration there. <BR> <BR>I think your ideas are pretty solid, but I think
    you&#39;ve got a long way to go in the posters&#39; designs. The font on the Kraft
    one is hard to read. Also, you have a really good opportunity to contrast the
    woman and the stove with type. Maybe separate the images with the type. <BR> <BR>The
    Kraft one: I would drop the hyphens and write &#34;mom who does everything&#34;.
    I also think the washer and dryer are too big. <BR> <BR>Overall, your concepts
    are strong, but the design isn&#39;t there yet. I would consider a thick sans
    serif for the body text instead of the display types you&#39;re using. For something
    like this I wouldn&#39;t feel bad recommending Helvetica. <BR> <BR>Have you thought
    about colors? These could look really nice with some washed out colors. <BR> <BR>Does
    anybody have tutorials or know a way to get faded colors and images, ala MisterRetro&#39;s
    machine wash filters?'

    ad and make a present-day looking ad - and use the copy &#40;the words&#41; to
    make your point, rather then depending on old fonts and image treatements to do
    your work.  <BR> <BR>But I found some old ads that might help you anyway. My only
    comment is that I don&#39;t think many were 4 colour - ads for the time frame

  body: 'Allison, I think your plan of attack needs a little tinkering. You&#39;re
    trying to portray women as professionals and housewives, but you&#39;re running
    into a problem, namely that you seem to want to use 50s style to reinforce the
    fact that women &#60;em&#62;weren&#39;t&#60;em&#62; professionals back then, and
    that advertising hasn&#39;t modernized its portrayal of women. I think you have
    some potential for tongue-in-cheek stuff here, starting with the first line. <BR>
    <BR>I might consider adjusting the first line to: Don&#39;t have all day to prepare
    the family dinner? <BR> <BR>Then the next one you might try: You need all the
    help you can get! &#40;exclamation points must be used with discretion, this is
    a rare case where I think it&#39;s ok&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Had a long day at work
    and now you have to cook? etc...&#40;the rest of this paragraph is nice&#41;&#34;
