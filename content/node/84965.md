body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nmy name is Fivos Vilanakis and this is my first post in
  Typophile forums.\r\nI'm the chief technical officer at Softonium Developments Inc
  and I'd like to introduce our new application named \"Find my Font\".\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://www.findmyfont.com/images/stories/fmf/screenshots/FMF-Win-Connected-Letters_sm.png\"
  alt=\"Find my Font Screenshot 1\" /> <img src=\"http://www.findmyfont.com/images/stories/fmf/screenshots/FMF-OSX-Main_sm.jpg\"
  alt=\"Find my Font Screenshot 2\" />\r\n\r\nProduct site:  http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n\r\n'Find
  my Font' reads scanned images or photos and then goes through all the fonts on your
  computer and matches the letters in the scanned image against the fonts in your
  computer. You are provided with a list of matching fonts along with the matching
  accuracy for each one. You may also type some text and see how well the matching
  went.\r\n\r\nIt's ideal for font designers, graphic designers and creative professionals
  who would otherwise spend hours trying to find a matching font.\r\n\r\nThe main
  features of \"Find my Font\" are:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It runs natively on both Windows
  (XP, Vista, Windows 7) and Mac OS/X (intel based)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. It
  works with all common image formats or a screen capture</strong>\r\nYou can load
  any common image file (bmp, gif, jpg, png, tif, +others) or use the screen capture
  tool to work with a web image or a the on-screen image of another application.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.
  Smart selection tools - No special image preprocessing required</strong>\r\nIt provides
  special tools to easily select any letters present in a color image with no need
  for a white-background or special image preprocessing. You can e.g. rotate the image,
  make the text baseline horizontal, split any script letters, or select a letter
  placed on a complex color background with a few simple clicks.\r\n\r\n<strong>4.
  Matches all of your OTF/TTF fonts either installed or not</strong>\r\nIt matches
  the letters you select from an image, against all Open Type (*.otf) or True Type
  (*.ttf) fonts installed in your system. You can also specify any number of additional
  folders containing not installed OTF/TTF fonts and even switch on/off any of these
  font-sets on a specific matching.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Unicode support</strong>\r\nThe
  Find my Font (Pro edition) supports both matching & indexing on the full unicode
  range of font characters.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Incredible matching speed!</strong>\r\nThe
  latest version of 'Find my Font' achieves incredible matching speeds. Thanks to
  our new proprietary indexing algorithm the application is able to scan up to 5 million
  fonts per minute. At these speeds you can examine e.g. 100.000-200.000 fonts in
  just 5-10 seconds!\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Precise Matching!</strong>\r\nYou can find
  both exact matches of the font you are searching and/or similar fonts. \r\n<strong>When
  it comes to matching accuracy we are confident enough to say that, If you don't
  see an exact match of the font you are searching on the top 5 matching positions,
  this font probably does not exist in your computer!</strong>\r\nTry the free-trial
  edition to believe it!\r\n\r\nYou can find more on product-editions or download
  the free-trial application here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/download/compare-editions\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Using
  \"Find my Font\" as a copyright protection tool</strong>\r\nThere is a special use
  of Find my Font for font designers: To protect your copyrighted work.\r\nWe all
  know there are many sites out there claiming they have \"free fonts\" but most of
  these are not actually free but illegal copies of commercial fonts packaged under
  different filenames and/or different family names.\r\nIf you download all available
  fonts of a \"free fonts\" site and use your font design as input, Find my Font can
  tell you in seconds if there are any illegal copies of your design in the downloaded
  fonts.\r\n...and this is only possible because you can instruct Find my Font to
  match against e.g. 100.000 fonts and still get very accurate results in just 5-10
  seconds!\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that font designers are actually the most demanding users
  of our application and I'd love to hear your opinion and thoughts whatever it is
  - things you like, you don't like, things to improve, anything.\r\n\r\n<strong>For
  this reason we have decided to give 15 Promotion-Codes for Typophile users to download
  the Find my Font Pro edition for Windows or Mac OS for free.</strong>\r\nThe only
  thing we ask in return is to write your opinion here in this thread to help us improve
  our product.\r\n\r\n<strong>Feel free to respond to this message and ask me to send
  you a free promotion-code to download the Pro Edition.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Current
  Count: All PROMO-CODES are given!</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish you lots of creative
  time!\r\n\r\nFivos Vilanakis\r\nSoftware Engineer\r\nSoftonium Developments\r\n\r\n\r\nPS:
  Although the main purpose of this message is promotional, I have to admit that I'm
  personally involved in both design and coding of the product and I'm really proud
  of the final result, therefore I really need to hear your opinion about it. Thank
  you for your time!\r\n\r\n===================================================\r\n<strong>UPDATE

    forward and easy to learn, uses standard keystrokes like shift to add element
    in multipart characters. I can see this as a great creative aid as well as for
    straight identification - gives you variants in same range for consideration from
    your font collection. Also the font preview window lets you compare the match
    to see how close other fonts are to original sample. Usefulness of this tool knows
    no limits as a way to view your font collection. Impressed on first half hour

    you find the interface easy and straight forward because that was one of our primary
    goals.\r\n\r\nI agree that a different UI skin would make the application more
    attractive, but there are some inherent limitations due to the Nokia's Qt framework
    we use to produce the dual Windows / Mac version. Every \"beautification\" of
    the UI must be designed & tested to work well on both Mac & Windows and this is
    not always easy.\r\n\r\nI agree that a connection to a big external font library
    would be a great plus for the application, although as Karsten pointed out the
    \"restriction\" of searching only your own library can also be considered as a
    big advantage: You may find similar fonts that you already have and you could
    avoid to buy a new one (or the same one).\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be
    to create a proprietary font library for each major font distributor (e.g. Adobe,
    Linotype) and let Find my Font download them and use them for matching. Such libraries
    will contain off-course only the required matching information -not the actual
    fonts- and maybe a link to the distributor's site to view/buy any fonts you need.
    But you already have WhatTheFont if you want to go this way.\r\n\r\nWe are examining
    carefully all the alternatives and some of them are even under development, but
    I can't say more or promise anything at the moment.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nFivos"

  body: Fivos, Really like the thought of a proprietary font libraries feature - set
    up so you could use your own library first and then go further afield if you do
    not have a match in house. Would think font foundries might like that too as a
    great selling tool.

    name?  When I chose Greek glyphs and switched to Greek keyboard, it worked fine!\r\n\r\nI
    gave it a tough time by using close valued colors and it did not blink!  \r\nI
    have designed a face which stays the same weight but varies in width with some
    fairly close gradations; and it picked the correct one each time! I will post
    a few images to show what I tested.  As a general rule, it seems to need stem
    width of at least 3 pixels wide to get started, otherwise, it selects only a piece
    of the glyph.\r\n\r\nI would say that this is a valuable tool for me!\r\n\r\nTHANKS!!!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squeeze_4543.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/headsup_6569.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/froggy_5531.jpg]"

  body: "Chris, \r\nthank you so much for your time and the extended test you performed!\r\n\r\n(a)
    Regarding the screenshot tool, you are right: It gives a black image in OSX Lion
    - we will fix this on next release.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) Regarding your comment \"I
    also tried glyphs with diacritics such as eogonek but had no way to let the software
    no the proper glyph name?\"\r\nYou are right again, although the \"Text To Match\"
    box accepts the full unicode range of characters you need to switch to the appropriate
    keyboard to type the character you want. I think we should develop an alternate
    input method to allow easy insertion of any unicode character.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c)
    Many many thanks for the font-variations test!\r\nWe never performed such a test,
    and I'm glad the results are good.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) Regarding your comment \"could
    not separate reverse figure ground here;\"\r\nyou can use the following options
    to separate/select letters when their color is very close to background:\r\n1)
    Change the Tolerance Letter Selection Tool to a lower level from e.g. 32 (the
    default) to 10 or lower. This can be modified either in preferences or by click
    and hold the mouse button on Letter Selection Tool.\r\n2) If after lowering the
    tolerance, the letter selection tool selects only part of a letter, you can hold-down
    the Shift or Control key and append many selections to the current letter until
    all main parts of the letters are selected.\r\n(See also:\r\nHelp -> How To Procedures
    -> Letter Selection -> Selecting multi-part letters)\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) Regarding
    your comment \"I could not get the cropping tool to do anything but draw blue
    lines\"\r\nThe Letter Splitter Tool does not actually crop the image but enables
    you to draw blue lines which are used as boundaries when you select the next letter.
    You just draw a line at the position you want the letters to be split and then
    you select the next letter as usual. I think it's easier this way...\r\nThis will
    also work well with the Greek double Gamma letters.\r\n(See also: Help -> Tutorials
    -> Split Text)\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) Regarding your comment \"Ligatures and swashes were
    problematic but as long as I chose a normal glyph, it works pretty well!\", \r\nI
    suppose this is related to Letter Selection Tool tolerance and multiple selection
    method I described in (d) above. \r\nIf not, would you please elaborate more on
    this issue?\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time :-)\r\nFivos\r\n"

    the story but not what I was looking for. For me, it would be valuable to find
    and match ligatures and even alternate for a font.  When designing type, I often
    make many variations on either ligatures or mostly contextual alternates that
    only come into play in certain situations or combinations of glyphs. I find it
    hard to tell from my printed samples, which of the variants was chosen by the
    coding.  Most variants are there to get around awkward joins.  An example might
    be the ear of the g.  It can work fine with most letters but get awkward next
    to a \"y\"--a common possibility.  I realize that his is a very specialized need
    and surely not worthy of you losing any sleep.  There might be 500 people in the
    world who might care--hardly a big market!\r\n\r\nChris"

- body: "Thank you for the promo code. I spent quite a while today using \"Find My
    Font\" and trying different settings -- it's very useful! For the record, I have
    a good friend who is a manager at Adobe and I'll show him the software next month
    when I see him. He doesn't work in Adobe acquisitions, but nonetheless I think
    he'll be impressed.\r\n\r\nSo, here are my notes. I've been told I can be brutally
    critical....so don't take my opinion personally. It's meant to be constructive
    criticism. \r\n\r\nAfter I entered my license number to activate the software,
    a popup dialog said the application \"will restart\" so I clicked OK. It didn't
    restart; it just quit. Eventually, I stopped waiting and restarted it myself.
    No big deal, but it made me wonder how stable the software was.\r\n\r\nIt works
    pretty well; no crashes, freezes, or confusing/incomplete documentation. It accurately
    finds fonts based on pixels, which is impressive and quite useful. I expect to
    use it often. If I don't encounter bugs over the next few weeks, I'll gladly recommend
    it to clients and co-workers. \r\n\r\nWhat would I change? Rather than showing
    a (text-only) list of possible matches, I'd like to see thumbnails. It's kinda
    cumbersome to scroll through and see each font preview individually. I'd rather
    compare thumbnail previews of all the possible matches visually in one window.
    \r\n\r\nHonestly? This might sound harsh, but\u2026\u2026I'd be very unlikely
    to buy this software based on the website and logo. No offense, but clearly your
    logo wasn't done by a professional graphic designer. Had I found your software/website
    via google, I'd seriously doubt this company knows anything about type design,
    graphic design or typography. In fact, the only reason I even noticed you on Typophile
    was because I was puzzled how somebody who used a faux-metallic gradient avatar
    (that isn't optically centered) had an eye sharp enough to visually identify so
    many fonts in the forum. \r\n\r\nThis fear was not abated (heightened actually)
    when I saw the very first page of \"Tutorial 1\" boldly featured Arial, Comic
    and Calibri. (Shudder!) Frankly\u2026.I was embarrassed to have the window open
    to the tutorial graphics and looked over my shoulder hoping my co-worker didn't
    notice! :) \r\n\r\nSo, if your target market is graphic designers..\u2026.maybe
    hire one to add some visual sophistication? And, for the love of Jan Tschichold,
    stop with all the Comic Sans unless you're a kindergarten teacher!\r\n\r\nOn the
    upside, the documentation is comprehensive and well-written. So, in conclusion;
    it works well and does what you advertise, but it could use some refining from
    a type snob. If you can do that, well, \"Find My Font\" could become genuinely
    indispensable for anyone who works with type. (wow!)"

    The first odd behavior was bad; it would search for matching fonts, find a few
    (above an 80% match) then, when it was done searching, the window went blank.
    It showed the potential matches while searching...but once it's done, there's
    nothing listed. White space. I tested it on a font I own, so aside from the fact
    it found it while searching, I know there's a match.(BTW; is there a message to
    indicate \"no matching fonts\"?)\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to restart the application.
    As soon as I hovered over the \"file\" menu, I got a beach ball. It spun for about
    two minutes -- something that's <em>never once happened</em> on this computer
    before -- then, this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/find-my-font-quit_6215.jpg]\r\n\r\nWould

    Oblique or artificial Bold typeface based on your original font file.\r\nYou can
    also rotate the whole image, horizontalize the text baseline, or split connected
    script letters.\r\n\r\nFor the future we plan to add some new tools to recognize

    by checking every time if a font he/she downloaded from a (supposed) \"free fonts\"
    site is really free, or there is actually a commercial license to be acquired
    before using it in a project.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, I suppose that many people
    are searching for a font using e.g. the WhatTheFont service and then they download
    the matching font from other illegitimate sources and sites.\r\nThe later I'm
    sure they will do exactly the same, even if we provide them with downloadable
    Find my Font libraries.\r\nThey will also do the same with our software: Instead
    of buying Find my Font, they will try to find an illegitimate cracked version
    of it.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that Find my Font is just another tool

    say this:\r\na) All glyphs must be present in the library because we don't know
    in advance which glyphs a user may select for matching or preview\r\nb) The glyph
    outlines are not required; a low resolution bitmap image should be sufficient
    for a small-size preview. This way a font vendor can be sure that there is no
    way for anyone to acquire the original outline font data from our libraries.\r\n\r\nAt
    this point I need to repeat that, we haven't yet decided how we will implement
    the feature of non-local fonts matching (it can be downloadable libraries, but
    it can be as well a connection to a remote server) and we also cannot promise
    yet any release date for this feature.\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughts\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Bob</strong>,
    \r\nyou are so right! Even I, which I have zero background on font-design and
    a highly untrained eye, I have come to realize that there can be so many small
    variations based on each font designer decisions, that is almost impossible to
    visually remember all the details and differences between 2 similar fonts."

    makes me wonder if Find My Font could be offered as a web service rather than
    a downloadable app?"

  body: "Hi Ben,\r\n\r\nalthough at the last messages we all talk about Font-Libraries
    etc,\r\nyou should consider that the primary purpose of Find my Font, \r\nis to
    match an image against local fonts on your computer.\r\nThis is not possible -or
    at least it would be much more difficult and very slow-\r\nif  the application
    is offered <strong>only</strong> as a web service.\r\n\r\nMore than this, I don't
    think anybody will be willing to pay for such a service when he can use instead
    e.g. WhatTheFont or your excellent ID forum here in Typophile.\r\n\r\nAn alternative
    is to offer both:\r\n(a) Find my Font (for local fonts) + connection to a web-service
    (for vendor fonts)\r\n(b) An independent payed iPhone application (vendor fonts
    only)\r\n\r\n..but that's another story, and only the future can show us if there
    is a market big enough to support the developing of such applications.\r\n\r\nFivos"

  body: True, good to think about all the angles, competition and alternative possibilities.
    I'll be very interested to see how it all evolves. It's a very exciting time in
    the font industry. (Or maybe it's always an exciting time :)

  body: "At last I\u2019m adding my two cents about the tool.\r\nThey\u2019re pretty
    random observations and I\u2019m sorry if they overlaps with the ones of others.\r\n1.
    First thing, since it is aimed at professional users, which most probably use
    some font management software or another, Find My Font should, upon the first
    launch, ask the user where they keep their font files. And/or ask if they would
    like the app to scan their drives for font files.\r\n2. I like the single window
    approach, I find the numbers between parentheses (used to order the steps) distracting.
    They should at least be replaced by more graphic elements or, better yet, with
    a different solution (maybe disabling input on the not ready yet steps and/or
    highlighting the current step).\r\n3. Some kind of auto-discovering/guess of shapes
    would be welcome.\r\n4. Some of the common behaviours I\u2019m missing are:\r\n-
    Click and drag to zoom a portion of the image (with the auto-guess thing it would
    be useful a click and drag selection too).\r\n- Command-z to undo.\r\n- In the
    Finder, the ability of right click on a image file and have Find My Font on the
    list of \"Open with\u2026\" apps.\r\n5. The tooltips on the icons show the Windows
    keyboard shortcuts even in the Mac version (and Command-s is always used for Save,
    so it\u2019s a bit confusing having it for Screenshot).\r\n6. Adjustable/moveable
    letter splitters would be a nice addition.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the main of it :-)\r\n"

    and (if the image has a simple background) to automatically select the letters?\r\n...or
    do you mean something different? \r\n\r\n<blockquote>4. Some of the common behaviours

    can zoom in/out using the mouse wheel.\r\nDid you miss this functionality or do
    you think a more precise rectangle-based zoom tool is required?\r\n\r\nYou have
    an eye for the detail for sure, and all of your observations are very valuable
    and welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nFivos"

    yes, I think a rectangle based zoom would be useful (also note that Apple's mice
    don't have a scroll wheel).\r\n\r\nGlad to have been of some service."

    for zooming (for example, in Flash), I\u2019m used to think of this feature as
    a Windows thing ;-)\r\nAlso, rectangle selection to zoom is more precise.\r\nThat
    said, I\u2019ve now tested the scroll gesture in Find My Font and indeed it works
    very well."
