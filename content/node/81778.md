  newsprint in aobut 9 or 10pt with footnotes in 7pt. Should I buy ITC Bodoni optomized
  for six or for 12 pt???\r\n\r\nNot sure which will be most effective or if it will
  even make very much difference!\r\n\r\nThanks :)"

    too dark, and the 12 would be less bad. But:\r\n- You're going to be testing things
    anyway, right?\r\n- Bodoni is not a good choice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Agreed, you should test it first. Agreed even more that Bodoni is a pretty
    poor choice for a newspaper face. There's a reason that newspaper typefaces have
    tended towards low-contrast rather than high-contrast for the past 75 years or
    so.\r\n\r\nGenerally given the curve of rate-of-change in optical scaling, the
    12-pt would theoretically be closer, but due to the high contrast of Bodoni, I'd
    probably prefer the 6-pt (which will have noticeably less contrast). But the more
    correct answer is likely \"neither.\"\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hey guys!\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\nYea your right... they both arent
    that great.\r\n\r\nIm imitating an 18th century newspaper though that was set
    in Bodoni (I think it was quite popular to do that then). It actually looks surprisingly
    good and relatively easy to read. Ill probably go with the 6 so there is less
    contrast.\r\n\r\nThanks again :)\r\n\r\nYael"

    stick to the style ...

    Bodoni MT and Bodoni ITC and Bodoni Old Face - they seem to be working ok for
    now. Not the best. But they are alright."
