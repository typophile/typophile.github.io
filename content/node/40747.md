  Cleveland called Notacon, and was looking for somebody who'd be interested in giving
  a talk about the basics of font design, the technical issues involved, and maybe
  give an overview of nifty OpenType features that people who aren't in the graphic
  design industry might not know about, but might find interesting.\r\n\r\nI'm considering
  doing the talk myself, but I've never done anything like this before. If there's
  anybody out there who lives near Cleveland and is more comfortable with this sort
  of thing, the Notacon people would love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nThe con runs April
  4-6, and you can see the call for proposals at http://www.notacon.org/cfp.html ."
