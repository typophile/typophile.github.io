body: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI'm working on a 120 page catalogue at the moment. Now, the
  client asked me to replace one of their house fonts (containing all their icons
  and numbers etc) with a newer version. Unfortunately all the spaces (as in hit the
  spacebar spaces) have changed. I was wondering if this might be a problem re-exporting
  the fonts as otf or did someone manually change the space?\r\n\r\nHope this makes
  sense.\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg"

  body: It's more likely that someone <em>didn't</em> change the default space width,
    which is normally 500 em units. As a rule, I normally set my space width to match
    that of an uppercase /I/ with a little extra added...

  body: "Thanks Oldnick\r\nJust to clarify (as I don't know how a font is built),
    the default space is its own character when you create a font? Or is it defined
    in the settings of the font file? \r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nJ\xF6rg"
