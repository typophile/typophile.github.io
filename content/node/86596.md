  or something that we see everyday...

  body: "Generally speaking, although I know there are some real doozers out there
    and plenty of them to be sure, a lot of crappy work is the result of companies
    with lots of doe and little taste hiring some one on the cheap to shill their
    crap. Generally, cheap means little talent, and the results are predictable...
    They are crap. No argument there, but the fact that the person who does the work
    has no talent isn't their fault. We all do what we can and there is no shortage
    of \"AAA Towing\" companies and \"Crazy Joe's Discount Carpets\" joints they can
    work for, but if a bigger company that should know better comes calling, they'd
    be stupid not to take the job. Their work naturally becomes a laughing stock,
    but really, who's to blame? I don't like to see the poor benighted schlubs who
    accept the job take the heat for the stingy corporation that hired them. \r\n\r\nAnd

    backgrounds jumping on the tables and flinging gravy at crazed senior citizens
    swinging their canes at each other all to the beat of a combination of rap, flamenco
    and Russian folk music. It's mostly quiet white people around 50.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    at me and told me to go hog wild with it but it has to be at the printer's in
    an hour.

  body: "Actually, the more I look at the Shakers ad, the more I think that it does
    send particular messages to the target demographic--white people over 50. First,
    the typography is downright archaic, so you don't expect young people to be there.
    The seeming incompetence of the design is a signal that the place is unpretentious.
    People who dine here don't know the names of typefaces, and if they could name
    one, it would probably be whatever the default is on their 10 year old PC. Its
    a place where 'regular people' can go and get a meal. Its not going to be too
    expensive. They'll have lots of choices. You don't have to worry about someone
    putting arugula on your salad or trying to convince to try vegan tapas or some
    other nonsense. If that is what they're trying to communicate, they did so very
    effectively. Its like Texas governors saying \"nucular\"--it means something to
    people who are looking for it.\r\n\r\nIn all the print-related jobs I've had,
    I can only recall typesetting a menu on one occasion. It was for a Chinese restaurant
    that wanted to cram 200 menu options onto a single take out flier. I tried to
    explain to them that if they are catering to non-Chinese diners, a more streamlined
    approach could allow them to potentially charge more. To a point, as restaurants
    move upscale they often have fewer items on the menu. They would have none of
    that, and I ended up committing some kind of atrocity with the leading. Who's
    to say though, maybe they knew their business better than I did. "
