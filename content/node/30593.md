  on it--[Link Removed by Moderator, TW]. I personally have fallen in love with the
  Hanch font from that site for my general writing purposes. I was just curious if
  any of you have any opinions about these fonts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yikes. From what I can tell, these fonts seem to be scanned from specimens
    of typefaces that already exist in digital form by their original publishers.
    Haunch is actually <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11118.0.0\">FF
    Scala</a>. And Haunch Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic are simply [[faux formatting|faux]]
    variants created automatically by a computer. See the real thing, drawn by a human,
    at FontShop. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend using these. Many may be in violation
    of copyrights. But worse, they are just poorly made."

  body: Ouch, Stephen is right. Haunch is an obvious rip-off. And indeed poorly made,
    as becomes apparent when opening one in FL. Anchorpoints-galore.

  body: Understandable. There are a few high quality free fonts, but for the most
    part, text type in particular, there is a price to pay for the type designer's
    hundreds of hours of labor, and it is usually worth the investment. Have a look
    at the [[foundries]] listed here for more reputable work. The ones with a gray
    arrow point to a page where you can learn more and usually a link to their official
    site. [[Essential Typefaces]] is another good starting point.
