  I need a japanese feel, but feminine typeface to go with the feel. I don't want
  to go very literal, just a mood.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Waves_4314.jpg]"

    looking for more contrast.

  body: My pleasure. I'm not familiar with the quality of the different version of
    Caslon 540, but URW's take on it come with a lovely swash italic that might come
    in handy.

    a look at  <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/brioso/brioso.html\">
