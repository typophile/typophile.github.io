  to rent a car while mine was in the shop, and a Dodge Charger was as cheap to rent
  as anything else. Even the lettering on the dashboard instrument panel was... Dodge
  Charger-ish. It was very \"not like me.\"\r\n\r\nSo! If you designed the dashboard
  instrument panel for your favorite vehicle(s), what typeface(s) would you use? (and
  what's the vehicle?)"

  body: As little type as possible. I like the ideal of purely analog, proportional
    display. You don't even really need numbers on the speedometer. Then I'd need
    to know, what's the means of display? Assuming back-lit LEDs, the font needs to
    be a little light and rounded to compensate for "light spread" and maintain legibility.
    After that, style-wise, it would depend on the rest of the car. If my dream-dash
    is part of my dream car, it's gonna be a bit techno but not space age techno.
    I'd say something that feels like OCR-A Std but I don't like the figures in that
    exact font.

    it.
