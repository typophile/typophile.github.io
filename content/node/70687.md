  large glyph above each number will be typeset in Bodoni, so the font used for the
  numbers should match. The examples above show a version of Johnston's font for London
  Transport, but the narrow ones and wide letters make some numbers look rather strange,
  and the opening in the four is too small to work at 5pt or smaller. Carrosserie
  seems a bit more promising, but it is marketed as a display face, so it may not
  work well at small sizes. I was thinking of something vaguely Art Deco-like, but
  what really matters is that it is legible at small sizes and that the pairs 8/B
  and 0/D are clearly distinct.\r\n\r\nThe problem of finding a font for hexadecimal
  numbers is related to an old proposal of encoding the letters A\u2013F separately
  for use as hexadecimal digits:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hex-letters_4419.png]\r\n\r\nI
  do not see it as a requirement that the letters and the decimal digits all have
  the same width, though."

    better at smaller sizes.

  body: "I had a similar need for typesetting [[http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514471/|\"CJKV
    Information Processing,\" Second Edition]] a couple of years ago, and used a custom
    version of Minion Pro and Myriad Pro that included tabular versions of some characters,
    such as \"A\" through \"F\" (for hexadecimal digits), \"U\" and \"+\" (for Unicode
    Scalar Values, such as \"U+4E00\"), and lowercase \"x\" (for hexadecimal digits,
    when prefixed with \"0x\"). I needed this because I used hexadecimal digits and
    Unicode Scalar Values throughout the book, and for the first edition I settled
    for Courier to get the tabular effect. Note that making the uppercase letters
    tabular involved not only their shapes in terms of their widths, but also their
    heights, to match the height of the digits. My colleague, Miguel Sousa, performed
    the modification. The glyphs were accessed via the 'ss03' GSUB feature, and I
    set up InDesign tags that invoked it, along with the 'zero' GSUB feature.\r\n\r\n[[http://lundestudio.com/CJKV2E/cjkv2e-p198-t43.png|Table
    4-3 on Page 198]] of the book is a good example of these glyphs in use."

  body: "Thanks for all your ideas and suggestions!\r\n\r\nTo answer some of the questions
    that have been raised either implicitly or explicitly, I am primarily looking
    for a font that works well in print at a small size, on-screen performance being
    less of a concern. Tabular width is not really important at all, but hexadecimal
    numbers tend to look funny if (some of) the letters are much wider than the digits
    (or, as Lunde pointed out, if they are of different height).\r\n\r\nSome further
    thoughts:\r\n\r\nHelvetica and more or less similar fonts have been suggested,
    but Helvetica has some characteristics which ITC Bodoni 72 does not share. In
    particular, the lower-left corner of the digit 2 in Helvetica has a characteristic
    shape quite unlike Bodoni\u2019s angular shape. Univers, Monotype Grotesque (condensed)
    and Akzidenz Grotesk (not condensed) are better matches from that point of view,
    but all have quite closed 6s and 9s that could potentially look like 8s at small
    sizes.\r\n\r\nMany sans serif fonts seem to have digits and capital letters of
    approximately the same width in their condensed versions, although this is often
    not the case for their regular versions, as is the case for Monotype Grotesque
    (whose condensed also equalises letter/digit heights):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grotesque-1_4403.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grotesque-2_6111.png]\r\n\r\nA
    different sans-serif option is to use a variation on the DIN fonts:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/din_3704.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    completely different idea of using ITC Bodoni 6 is intriguing, and one that I
    would like to try, but that would probably require some redesign given that the
    letters are rather wide compared to the decimal digits. The small capitals do
    not quite match the x-height of the old-style numerals either.\r\n\r\nSerifs help
    to make the B and D distinctive, but a plain design is required if the numbers
    are to appear more or less as part of the grid, thus allowing the large glyphs
    to stand out, which leads one to think of Egyptians (perhaps better known as slab
    serifs in some parts of the world). As it turns out, there actually exists a Bodoni-based
    Egyptian called Bodoni Egyptian which looks like it might work:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni-egyptienne_6600.png]"
