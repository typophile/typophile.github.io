    serif</a> than it is a slab.

  body: "I was going to say a customized Trajan, until I looked at Stephen's list.
    I think Mecanorma's [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Galba/fonts/|Galba]] is closer.
    Almost the only thing it needs is to close the P. The C  shape is what makes me
    choose it. The relative angle of the serifs seems like the PACIFIC lettering,
    even more than Trajan, and the serifs on the E and F are more like the sample.\r\n\r\n-
