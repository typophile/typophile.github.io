  russian typographic forum http://community.livejournal.com/ru_typography/. How can
  a typefoundry participate in a Corporate Social Responsibility? Particularly I am
  interested: can be the elaboration of free types (or a permission to use comercial
  type in free project without any cost) considered as such type of activities? It
  will be very interesting to know the western foundries approaches.\r\nYours\r\nVad"

    \ </em>\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nResponsible behavior is not the same as charitable behavior.\r\nCorporate
    responsibility means being law-abiding, nice to employees, supporting fair trade,
    and not polluting the environment too much.\r\nThis is not the same as giving
    away free products. "

    \"[...]Furthermore, CSR-focused businesses would proactively promote the public
    interest by encouraging community growth and development, and voluntarily eliminating
    practices that harm the public sphere, regardless of legality.[...]\". So if actively
    contribute with your fonts to the wellbeing of the society (making well legible
    and attractive signs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows], by
    the edition of free text books [there is an approach named philantropy], and so
    on), this couldn\xB4t be considered responsible behavior? (\"[...]An approach
    for CSR that is becoming more widely accepted is community-based development approach.
    In this approach, corporations work with local communities to better themselves.

  body: "<em>...this couldn\xB4t be considered responsible behavior?</em>\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nIt
    is not the responsibility of corporations to engage in charity or philanthropy.\r\nIt
    is their responsibility to conduct business in an ethical, legal manner.\r\n\r\nThe
    concept of CSR was developed by Public Relations specialists for businesses that
    are large and dangerous enough to have issues which could damage their profitability,
    through negative public opinion, employee disruption or government crack-down.\r\nIt
    is a way for big business to professionally manage such issues and minimize the
    heavy hand of government, by self-regulation.\r\nIt is a form of damage control.\r\nSome
    of the biggest proponents of CSR are resource extraction multi-nationals that
    disrupt poor communities with toxic programs of exploration and extraction; \"community
    development\" is how they buy off local resistance.\r\n  \r\nCSR is for a different
    scale and kind of business than those which publish digital fonts.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    it applies to software giants such as Microsoft, Apple and Adobe, which have small
    type departments.\r\nThese already give away free fonts!--which they do not because
    it's their responsibility for the well-being of society, but because free (bundled)
    fonts make it easier for customers to use their big money-makers -- computer hardware,
    operating systems, and major applications.\r\n\r\nFor an example of charity from
    foundries, consider Font Aid.\r\n\r\nFonts can certainly damage the public sphere,
    but only through their mis-use, so again, no responsibility to foundries.\r\n\r\nA
    type foundry does have responsibilities to society -- to make sure that its fonts
    work correctly (i.e. the characters are correctly encoded and well-made) and to
    avoid plagiarism. \r\n\r\nSo for the majority of foundries, ethics is more about
    the professionalism of the type designers who own the companies, than it is about
    \"giving back\" to society -- especially as type foundries do not have the huge
    revenue that generally spawns corporate largesse.\r\n\r\nIf a foundry has any
    social responsibility, it is to support its own niche of society, e.g. by sponsoring
    events such as TypeCon and the ATypI conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
