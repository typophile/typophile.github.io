  I found a rather interesting sign. It said, <em>Please wait on the other side of
  the glass partition</em>. Obviously, it was not the message that called my attention,
  but the typeface it was set on. Well, actually I should more accurately say, what
  struck me was <strong>how the</strong> (well known) <strong>typeface was rendered</strong>.
  The letters, cut in vinyl, were so badly* done that I wouldn't been able to identify
  the typeface, if some of the shapes weren't so ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nSo, here's the
  deal: I'll post one letter at a time, and you type-freaks (grin) try to guess the
  typeface. Here's the first:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ms_o.png]\r\n\r\n*
  They are so, so bad, that makes them good\r\n"

    not what it was originally.
