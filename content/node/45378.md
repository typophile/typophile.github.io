body: "Hello fellow typelovers!\r\n\r\nI'm doing a new typeface for the streetsigns
  in central Copenhagen (Denmark) as a schoolproject. This is a work in progress,
  but I'd love to hear your opinions.\r\n\r\nCurrently we're using a version of Transport,
  except for a few places where the old signs with varying typefaces remain. I want
  to replace Transport with something that is modern, but still capsules the architecture
  and typographical history we have (Engelhardt, Biilmaan, Bindesb\xF8ll, Achton Friis
  etc.).\r\n\r\nI've attached a pdf with examples of streetnames in my font, along
  with the typeface at its current state. I should mention that I'm very inspired
  by Engelhardts quirky old signs, example attached here:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Engelhardt_3502.jpg]\r\n\r\nYour
  critique would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nDaniel"

    most important, or is maintaining continuity with Danish letterform history important,
    or do you interpret \"something that is modern\" to mean it must be sans serif?
    What combination?\r\n\r\nIf you can answer questions like these, you'll have a
    direction to go in. The attachments seem like rubbings of the Engelhardt letters,
    which might be nice for print, but maybe not what you would want for new signs."

  body: "Hi, and thanks for your comment. Readability is important, but since I reckon
    people will have a good amount of time to interpret the signs, I don't think it
    should be the main thing. Maintaining continuity with the Danish letterform history
    is important, but I still think it's important to bring something new, which is
    what I'm talking about when I say 'modern'. I think an all caps serif is the way
    to go, like Engelhardt, because it \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 gives a more historic
    feel. The historic feel is important for me, as I've chosen central Copenhagen,
    with its 17/18'th century architecture. I want the typeface to give the viewer
    a feeling that they're in a historic place, but not in a museum.\r\n\r\nI've taken
    alot from Engelhardts signs, but I've also tried to take it to a new place, by
    making it higher, give it less contrast, removing vertical serifs on the G, S,
    C, make it more egyptienne like, and also by opening the letterforms by making
    them more square. I still think it needs more of its own life though, and luckily
    I still have a month more to work on it.\r\n\r\nPeter, could you please explain
    further why you'd like it for print but not for signs? Thanks alot!\r\n\r\nDaniel"

  body: "OK, so this is a modified version of Engelhardt's original. Maybe a sharper
    break with the past could be better, not sure. Your letters now might work on
    museum posters, brochures, banners on buildings.\r\n\r\nIt could be undistressed.
    The wavering outlines seem too quaint to me. Like a distressed typeface that says
    \"olde\". How much do you/should you repair for the present? What makes it Danish
    and not an elongated, low-contrast Walbaum?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of how this might
    appear on the street, will it be a raised or flat surface? That seems to be another
    question, with an effect on the design.\r\n\r\nAnyway, good luck."

  body: "Alright, I read your critique and after sitting and playing around with the
    letters I realized that you're probably right about it being too 'olde' for new
    signs. I think it could be fun to use for a print project though, f.ex a classic
    inner city restaurant or something..\r\n\r\nNow I've drawn up a sketch for a different
    direction, building the capitals from Engelhardt's, but with major changes, and
    also I've drawn a full set of minuscles. I'm still missing a couple of the capitals,
    and I have alot of doubts concerning the vertical serifs, especially on the s,
    S, C and G. I think the C and G might be too soft. I've attached the new file
    on the top post, seems like I can't make an attachment in a comment.\r\n\r\nThis
    is the first full typeface I've drawn, and I must say it's quite a mouthful..especially
    doing something classic, with referrals to history that still manages to be modern.
    Maybe that's just too much between two chairs, don't know.\r\n\r\nAbout the appearance
    on the street, I'd like them to be flat enamel signs, white on blue. I don't know
    if that would be possible financially, but it would be great.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Don't know if anyone is following this besides myself, but I've attached
    the newest version \u2013 with alot of changes \u2013 in the top post. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/signs-typo_6629.jpg]\r\n\r\nMost
    importantly I've opened up the e, aswell as compressing the whole font even more.
    Also, the capitals have been justified much more. I've also changed the \xC6 to
    a more regular one, changed both K's, and removed the vertical serifs on E and
    F.\r\n\r\nI think the X needs some massage on the widestroke serifs, and the dots
    on \xE5 and \xC5 should be more circular.\r\n\r\nIn the pdf I've also attached
    some photos of Copenhagen architecture for the typeface to work along with, images
    of the new and old signs, and examples of signs with my typeface.\r\n\r\nHope
    you like it,\r\nDaniel"

    time into it, the instroke on G, S, & E could stand to be a bit wider, and I think
    the G & C's terminals could look more like S's."

    a, m, b, and d. Lowercase g is outstanding.\r\n\r\nI agree with Hofweber about
    G-S-E-C and also think that (1) W is very wide; (2) Z could have a steeper central
    stroke \u2013and thus be a bit wider; (3) e and c would share the same bottom
    curve.\r\n\r\nKeep the nice work!"
