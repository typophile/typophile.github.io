  or too strict... somewhere in the middle... Can't look too heavy in black... Any
  suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n-t"

    Roman is, IMHO, horrible, at least in current digital form.  "

  body: "Actually, University Roman is neither a Victorian face nor a 70s face. It's
    based on a face called Stunt Roman, from the Speedball Textbooks by Ross George,
    which appeared in several editions from the 1920s on. In the 13th edition (ca
    1938, the earliest I have), it looked like this...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stunt-Roman_5109.gif]\r\n\r\nBy
    the 20th edition (issued 1960; reprinted 1965 &amp; 1972), a number of the quirks
    had been smoothed out, and it looked alot more like the face we've come to know
    as University Roman."

  body: "This makes sense--sort of--as lettering. Since the letterer can alter the
    swashes and proportions at will, they perhaps can make the 'stunt' work for a
    few words.  \r\n\r\nThe 'stunt' is to have extremely wide round letters and extremely
    narrow straight letters. Ungainly proportions. Then throw on the swashes.  \r\n\r\nI
    don't think it ever worked as a font. "

  body: "Stunt Roman is beautiful! I never realized it was University Roman's parent
    so to speak.\r\n\r\nHowever, I always thought University Roman (Stunt Roman) had
    Victorian characteristics, not necessarily developed in the Victorian era, but
    drawing from some of the elements of the day. How wrong am I?"

    Souvenir and Korinna.\r\nMore of your fave fonts, eh Bill?\r\n\r\nMy father, who
    is a big CR Mackintosh fan, has University Roman for the name sign of his house,
    and insists Mackintosh designed it. Parents!...."

  body: "Like others who frequent these boards I have feelings about type the way
    most people do about other people. \r\n\r\nNot very rational but: \r\n\r\nITC
    Garamond I actually think can look good in display, though it is bad in text.
    I think Tony Stan drew type well, including American Typewriter and Berkeley.
    So kill me. \r\n\r\nSouvenir I think is all around a very good face. It just has
    a softness that is out of fashion--or it it coming back?\r\n\r\nKorinna I don't
    know. \r\n\r\nUniversity Roman they should kill and put a stake through its heart,
    before it can extend its evil tendrils further :)\r\n\r\nEdit: Nick, looking at
    the numerals, I see they don't suffer from the truly ungainly proportions of the
    rest. "

  body: "To get back on track a bit, Carter & Cone's Monticello is a sort-of-scotch
    roman & much better rendered than the various PostScript Caledonia's & Linotype
    Scotch Roman for setting text.\r\n\r\nPrinceton commissioned the digital Monticello
    (non-exclusive). I believe you can buy it from Linotype as well, but in the early
    days at least, it didn't have the full character compliment that the fonts from
    Carter & Cone had. Besides, one should support the small foundries.\r\n\r\nIf
    if bothers you that Monticello is derived from a Binney & Ronaldson (i.e., American)
    typeface, then use one of the horrible PostScript Scotch romans -- just remember
    that B&R were good thieves, so I'd say it is a \"name thing.\""
