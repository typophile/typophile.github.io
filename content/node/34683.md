body: hi, i would like to know where to find or how to make a greek glyph template
  like the one Fontlab has for Latin when you make a new document. And how to generate
  so as there would be no problem when the font is used.

  body: "Question marks, or question marks in boxes? In what software? On what operating
    system?\r\n\r\nThe most likely explanation is that you have managed to generate
    a font with an unrecognised encoding. Probably you have not assigned correct Unicode
    values to the Greek glyphs and/or the 8-bit charset is not recognised by the software
    you are using."

  body: You need to ensure that your Grek characters have the correct Unicode encoding.
    Is your font for polytonic, or only for monotonic? As a start, set FontLab's Font
    Window to Codepage mode, and select the Windows 1253 Greek codepage. This will
    give you a template for correctly encoding monotonic Greek.
