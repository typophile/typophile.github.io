  Diacritics group]] recently, and got to think about what it is that makes a typeface
  suitable for editorial work. News faces often raise the x-height, retract the descenders
  and tighten both spacing and letterforms, and wierd (and sometimes wonderful) variants
  of cap+diacritics are often deployed by the tabloids to set lines even tighter.
  Magazine type is less gross, with elegant logotypes, ligatures and alternate letterforms.
  Anyway, let's get to the point.\r\n\r\nFor the type designer: Which alternates,
  ligatures or treatments are clients most often requesting? Which ones do you find
  most interesting yourself?\r\n\r\nFor the graphic designer: In a display face, what
  kind of sprinkle do you find most useful in editorial design? \r\n"

    have received have been for additional weights or alternate forms for \"g\" or
    \"a\".\r\n\r\nAs a graphic designer, I tend to be a purist and try to avoid \"sprinkle\"
    or frosting or extra peanuts. What I look for are a good range of weights (more
    are not necessarily better - after a certain point it gets ridiculous), maybe
    a titling style, small caps, fractions, and old-style figures - useful stuff rather
    than frills.\r\n\r\n"

    get very few requests.\r\nOne can get an idea of what features are expected in
    a font (and at what price) from retail sales.\r\nIMO, it's a good sales strategy
    to load up a typeface with weights, styles, and features, and price the full family
    package low. This results in a greater proportion of sales being packages rather
    than single fonts, and larger total revenue.\r\n\r\n<em>Which ones do you find

  body: "As a graphic designer, I would love to see more alternate characters for
    numbers. I often think I have chosen the perfect typeface . . . until I realize
    I need to use a few numbers. The numeral \"1\" can make or break type selection.
    This is a particular concern when using numbers for a year/s. \r\n\r\nI appreciate
    the alternate numerals for 2 and 7 in [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames|Eames

    double g, double e, on diacritics the tilde: \xF1\r\n\r\nAs a designer, it depends
