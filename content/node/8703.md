  body: The text engine in Illustrator was completely changed in CS to support Unicode,
    and other new advanced typographic features. Because of these changes, it is not
    possible to save back to earlier versions without losing the structure. This is
    also apparently why you now &#34;export&#34; to earlier versions rather than &#34;save.&#34;

  body: The only work around I have found is to have 10 and CS open at the same time.
    After you export the CS to 10, create text boxes of the same dimension in the
    recently exported/opened doc. Copy and paste. Other than that it is definitely
    one of the little problems with which we learn to deal. &#40;And we say thanks
    that the new CS text engine is so much better even if we can&#39;t open proper
    text boxes in 10&#41;

  body: What happens if you go via pdf, ie export from cs to pdf, then open the pdf
    in ai10? That might work for stuff that is not too complicated, although I haven&#39;t
    tried it.

  body: Vojtech, if you export your file as an &#34;Illustrator Legacy file.ai&#34;,
    you can open it in Illustrator 10 without any trouble. It works for me.
