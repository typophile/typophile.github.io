  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I don&rsquo;t really know if I&rsquo;m in the right forum, but this is my problem - I have chosen Perla for my logotype and posted another topic about that a while ago when I needed help to make an image out of it. Every single person I asked - and I talked to about ten or so - gave me different solutions how to do that, but I followed Lherrou&rsquo;s advice - thank you!  :-) But I took the easy suggestion and not the one including CSS. It worked, but the font looks &ldquo;grainy&rdquo; and not sharp enough. My question is - does the &ldquo;CSS way&rdquo; make the font sharper? Or is there another way I can do that? I paid quite a lot for that font and I love it and it&rsquo;s a big part of my web site so it&rsquo;s really bad if I can&rsquo;t make it look better. Would be really grateful for some help!  :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you&rsquo;re making an image out of the font, CSS has nothing to do with it (it has nothing to do with rendering quality anyway), and what you&rsquo;re encountering is the limits of resolution of the screen: there aren&rsquo;t enough pixels to make small text look very nice (especially for something as expressive as Perla). One thing you should check is that (if you&rsquo;re using Photoshop) the text rendering (the &ldquo;aa&rdquo; field) is set to &ldquo;Smooth&rdquo; and not &ldquo;None&rdquo;. But if it is set to smooth and you&rsquo;re still unhappy then it means there&rsquo;s only one way to go: painting the individual pixels by hand to get the maximum quality. The thing is, this is pretty hard to do yourself, and pretty expensive to get somebody else to do.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sort of guessing here, and I might be off concerning
what you&rsquo;re unhappy with, so showing an image would help.</p>

<p>Perla has fine details that will get lost at smaller sizes. I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by &ldquo;CSS way,&rdquo; but CSS can&rsquo;t sharpen a graphic. There are ways to adjust the antialiasing in Photoshop which can affect the sharpness.</p>

<p>Scott D - Yes, Perla has these really fine details in the lower case letters, especially with the a:s and e:s. I mentioned CSS because that came up when I was going to convert the letters to an image and I just wanted to know if that could improve the quality.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not surprising, especially if you have ClearType enabled.
BTW if you like the Word rendering better, you can use it! Just
do a screen-grab of the Word setting and bring it into Photoshop.</p>

<p>You just zoom in in Photoshop and click away,
with the pencil tool, set to one pixel. But that

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On Windows you do a screen grab by hitting the Alt-PrintScreen key sequence;
then you do a Paste in Photoshop. On Mac I think it&rsquo;s Shift-Option-1 or something,
I forget; then you load up the screen grab file that&rsquo;s on the desktop.</p>
<p>Hinting and kerning are different things. The kerning you might need
to worry about is manual spacing adjustments between letters in a given
setting to make the spaces balance. But in Word this is quite tedious, so it
might be better here to nudge things around in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Small, for a normal font, is less than about 24 pt (18 pt in &ldquo;native&rdquo;
Windows). But for a font like Perla the threshold is much higher.</p>

Without the Alt it grabs the whole screen, which is generally less useful.</p>

<p>It will look the same, unless you scale it, which is almost never
a good idea however. But it will look a bit lighter on Macs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to figure out how large your images
will come out on your users' screens, all you have to
do is factor in your own screen&rsquo;s size, comparing it
to the typical screen size, which is about 1024×768.</p>

<p>As for the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; size of a web page, it depends on your content, layout, and audience. You&rsquo;re probably fine with a design that has an overall width of less than 1024 pixels these days.

<p>Still needs a lot of tweaking but is maybe passable. I took your source file, reduced it to 50% using bicubic interpolation, duplicated the layer, set the top layer to &lsquo;multiply&rsquo; mode, then tweaked the opacity of the top layer to suit.</p>

I was going to try your suggestions last night - with some

I am doing it today and I hope I can make it look better.</p>
<p>But if not - the question is, do you think it looks so
bad that I should find another font? Or is it acceptable?
I&rsquo;d be deeply grateful for opinions on this.</p>

<p>Maybe you didn&rsquo;t understand? I haven&rsquo;t launched the site yet. 
This is a logotype for a new business and there could be
a risk that someone would &ldquo;steal&rdquo; or copy an idea and then
I would end up looking like the copy cat. There are thousands
of visitors here every day so I don&rsquo;t think my concern was
completely unfounded. There&rsquo;s no need to be sarcastic.</p>

<p>Here is Perla set in Photoshop at the same size as your example. I have used the four anti-aliasing method provided in Photoshop CS2 to show the subtle variations in rendering that can occur. (Top to bottom: Sharp; Crisp, Strong, Smooth) The bottomost example shows Perla with anti-aliased turned off completely.</p>
<p>I would argue that all of these (save the aliased version) are acceptable.</p>

Yup, I always found the biggest differences to be between &ldquo;strong&rdquo;, &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; or &ldquo;none.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t ever remember using crisp or smooth. Both add too much aliasing in a blurry way for my taste.</p>
<p>Do you have CS3 and are saying there&rsquo;s really no improvement in the aliasing controls?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kis had agreed to leave The Netherlands after learning punchcutting. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you wouldn&rsquo;t like to engage in the cyberspace equivalent. :-)  So since you&rsquo;re bereft of a practical place to leave to&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my invention, and I wouldn&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;cunning&rdquo; - although there typically is an &ldquo;Ah! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?!&rdquo; moment when one finds out the (main) trick: in terms of bezier mechanics, you simply need to think of a 4×4 subgrid. This is actually patented, but the patent owners (not me) have decided not the enforce it.* The way you get to a 4×4 subgrid pixelfont varies; ideally you use the Ultrafonts converter (don&rsquo;t ask for it dude) which saves you a <cite>lot</cite> of time, by taking a GIF image of a glyph matrix and spitting out a TT font; but you can roll your own too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Mercedes does (used to do?) a lot in the interest of safety. Pure class.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing is though, the bezier mechanics is the (potentially) tedious, but easy part; the really hard, zen-mastery part is striking a quite peculiar balance, one not present in either 1-bit pixelfonts or outline fonts: a balance between design fidelity, crispness, and even color. When you get &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo; of this balance, it&rsquo;s really quite unlike anything else in type design, and it&rsquo;s very brain-draining to keep properly focused. Somewhat like kerning, but without anything to write on paper to keep yourself on track, and with a lot more guesswork, experimentation and definitely way more squinting. You literally find yourself moving your upper body like a cobra in a trance. And all this doesn&rsquo;t even address the gamma issue: between platforms, but also between normal and &ldquo;reverse-video&rdquo; setting.</p>
<p>A totally different way is not to use an outline font, but to use something like BitFonter (now available for Windows - yay!) to produce a &ldquo;true&rdquo; bitmap font, which now can be grayscale, or even full color. But pixelfonts still have the advantage of being easier to deploy and more robust, especially cross-platform from what I gather.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going to Transylvania to print bibles. It might be fun. For a weekend.</p>
<p>Thanks, Hrant, for your explanation. I&rsquo;m not sure I understand everything you said. I shall commune with some spirits and hope for an epiphany or two.</p>
<p>If the Zen like process you speak of is like anti-aliasing by hand then I&rsquo;m already rather adept thanks to years of pushing pixels in DPaint on an Amiga. Happy days.</p>
<p>I would be satisfied with creating just one grey level for a pixel font in outline format. I wonder if I could generate a 50% grey pixel by dividing a single grid square into 2 equal triangles and leaving the outer one empty?</p>
<p>Hmmmm. Now where&rsquo;s that old copy of Fontographer?</p>

Yes, your previous experience would be invaluable here.</p>
<p>BTW in practice you need at least 5 grays (I mean including black and white) to
break into good usefulness; I originally made Mana-16 with only 4 grays, and
you can tell the compromise is too great. In the other two sizes I ended up using
most of the 17 (spooky number, I know) available grays.</p>
