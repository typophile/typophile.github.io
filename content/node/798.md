  body: 'I don&#39;t have much experience with flags &#40;that&#39;s what they&#39;re
    called, I think - not &#34;headlines&#34;&#41;, but: <BR> <BR>- The original really
    sucks. The type is lousy and indeed the key has to go, but... <BR>- Try working
    with a key <i>hole</i>. You can do some great things with that negative shape,
    either as a &#34;box&#34; or preferably as a counter in one of the letters. Or
    maybe one of the letters - maybe. <BR>- If your boss really insists on a key and
    not a hole, maybe you can give part of one letter some serration &#40;you know,
    like a key &#34;edge&#34;&#41;. But remind him that the more obvious a representation
    the less staying power it has. <BR>- I think the flag should indeed span the horizontal:
    that gives the user a strong message that it&#39;s a newspaper. <BR>- The rounded/sharp
    boxes you have don&#39;t seem to say anything relevant. <BR>- I don&#39;t like
    the &#34;PPT&#34; acronym. <BR>- All-lc might work best. <BR>- I think it should
    be &#34;student magazine&#34;, no possessive. <BR>- The font you&#39;re using
    seems to work, although it&#39;s a bit rough in spots. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
