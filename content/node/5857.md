  body: 'Linda, this looks like some fancy amateur freeware  <BR>or shareware font,
    and unfortunately that&#39;s not my  <BR>area of expertise. To make matters worse,
    there&#39;s  <BR>are numerous fonts like this one, all dispersed on  <BR>their
    respective websites, so tracking it down will  <BR>be a stroke of luck: or somebody
    recognizes it and  <BR>knows where to find it, or it will remain unidentified.  <BR>Sorry
    that I can&#39;t be more helpful...'

  body: 'Linda, your best chance is to ask the website where you saw this font used.
    I agree with Yves that this looks like an amateur design, like something at one
    of the scrapbooking/craft/hobby sites. Obviously it is trying to play off electronic
    circuit symbols, but a Google search on that term got nowhere. '

    A couple of days later she posted that it had been identified as &#39;DenkaiRegular&#39;.

  body: Oops I&#39;m so sorry Yves. I only posted that link just in case Linda wanted
    to get in touch with this Angie person. I did do a search for Denkai font yesterday
    but couldn&#39;t find mention of it any where.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Diane

  body: Hey no sweat Diane, you couldn&#39;t know that. It&#39;s just that I saw  <BR>Bible
    Script and a Lucian Bernhard face being offered for free,  <BR>and I&#39;m also
    not so sure about the rest of those fonts.

  body: I looked through that site and saw free copies of fonts I had paid for.  I
    don&#39;t mind free original fonts but giving away someone else&#39;s work makes
    no sense to me at all.   <BR> <BR>You guys, especially you, Yves, are always willing
    to give the benefit of the doubt.  I like that a lot. <BR> <BR>Sharon <BR> <BR>
