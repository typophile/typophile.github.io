  issue & a lot of expertise resides on this forum . . .\r\n\r\nI have sort of inadvertently
  gotten involved with a project for the Cherokee Museum in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThey
  wanted a smaller version of the Syllabary, which my wife made up. When we were up
  at Cherokee, one of the people who prepares documents written in Cherokee mentioned
  how much a problem it was for them to use the proprietary LaserCherokee software\u2014not
  that it didn\u2019t work, but was too expensive to put in classrooms so kids could
  learn the written form of the language.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that since we\u2019re
  dealing with a syllabary, and one already in Unicode to boot, it wouldn\u2019t be
  that hard to write a ligature feature (sub h n a by uni13BF etc.) for a font using
  a freeware Latin alphabet & the Cherokee font they already own. You have to cheat
  a little with the vowels. I wrote up a little test font & it seemed to work using
  InDesign.\r\n\r\nThe problem is finding a word-processing system that supports OpenType
  ligaturing features, and is cheap. They seem to use the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any suggestions?\r\n"

    Control Panel / Regional Settings), OpenType Layout features are processed using
    Uniscribe in applications such as Notepad or BabelPad (http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelPad.html
    ). Both of these are plain-text editors only, though. \r\n\r\nFunnily enough,
    there does not seem to be any widely-available word processor that would support
    this, though. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the tip. All the machines I saw at the Cherokee Museum were PC's
    running Windows XP. But my wife uses a Mac, and we saw the Mellel ad when looking
    for word processors that supported OpenType. After your comment, I think we'll
    spring for it.
