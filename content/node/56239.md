  to identify the body text.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was curious... in general, what would
  be considered the 'standard' default body text typeface for printed materials (brochures,
  newspaper, posters etc...) in the 50's.... ie the Times New Roman of the 1950's?
  \r\nI keep thinking Clarendon but I'm probably way off.\r\nthanks for your input!"

    done in 1930 so it could be used in the 50s."
