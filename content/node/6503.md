  body: don&#39;t ask for free fonts here, silly. you won&#39;t get any sympathy.
    if indeed it is a House industries font, you can purchase it at <a href="http://www.houseindustries.com"
    target="_blank">www.houseindustries.com</a>. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the link to <a
    href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=VEGAS-FO" target="_blank"> the Las Vegas
    collection</a>, which contains Fabulous. <BR> <BR>Oh i guess house does have some
    <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?page=freefonts" target="_blank"> free fonts</a>,
    but Fabulous isn&#39;t one of them.

  body: But why did they rotate the F? ech! House Industries&#39; fonts cannot be
    imitated for free either. If this is really what you want it would be worth it
    to license it.

    people make a living out of designing type, and I doubt  <BR>you&#39;d be that
    enthousiastic if somebody asked you to share  <BR>your paycheck or hand it over
    for free. <BR> <BR>You probably didn&#39;t know that, so I&#39;ll give you the
    benifit of  <BR>doubt, no harm done.'

  body: James, your sample is set too tight. Scripts like this should be set with
    the default spacing. That&#39;s why the Fl looks like an H.

    my previous settings even though I forget.

    for this band and this is their new logo, I thought if I could find a similar
    font I&#39;d change the graphics on my site to match - no big deal, I&#39;ll just
    keep using what I have <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
