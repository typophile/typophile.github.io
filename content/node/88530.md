  body: "I'd guess that's custom, but <a href=\"http://signdna.com/shop/\">SignDNA</a>
    should have some similar styles. That lower case 's' is something I've seen in
    a few of their fonts. Letterhead Fonts might be another possibility. Both sites
    feature the work of lettering artists.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately their site (Sign DNA)
    doesn't show alphabets for most fonts, and while I have many of them in my Script
    Font ID Guide, I made my samples years ago. Hot Shot, Big Medicine and Rosebud
    might be possibilities.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
