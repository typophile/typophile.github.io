  do you think Lisboa's performance would be on a website?\r\n\r\nIs it even worth
  it? Will the attention to a more flavorful font be noticeable??\r\n\r\nInterested
  in any opinions. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I've noticed that at small sizes, the Uppercase
  \"R\" is shorter than other letters... why is this so?"

  body: This is due to [[hinting]] or the font's lack thereof. At small sizes most
    fonts will get wonky on screen. Only those with superior hinting will do well
    without specially designed bitmaps.

      a website that may have some flavoring would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nwnf"

  body: How large? I highly recommend sticking with HTML text for anything under 18pt.
    Lisboa will work just fine as a GIF at 18+.

    \"M\" is wide in every size/weight, but in a bitmap font it's not always possible
    to make symmetrical letters an ideal width, especially if you want to keep certainly
    corners sharp (one pixel). Also in bitmap fonts you have to mind the relationships
    of the various sizes, and you have to \"snap\" the glyphs in larger sizes to the
    wider possibility so you leave yourself enough room in the smaller sizes. You'll
    notice how some letters (like the \"T\") have quite different proportions across
    the sizes.\r\n\r\nThe sacrifices in a bitmap font can be strenuous and befuddling.\r\nLook
    at the \"v\" in 16 PPEM Georgia!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
