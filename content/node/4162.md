  body: Thanks for the plug Eduardo.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done a bunch more besides
    Vanity Fair, and in all those experiences it has ALWAYS been the art director
    of the magazine that had a very particular view of what the magazine should be
    typographically. I have not always agreed with their vision, but happily created
    whatever they asked me to create. So I think Stephanie should really look at the
    art directors and plot the various magazines they have worked on. I&#39;ll bet
    bullets to bagels that there is a consistent type selection going on throughout
    their careers. Whether or not it is good magazine typography is a matter of opinion.
    <BR> <BR>On a related note, if you find a current issue of Glamour, there are
    a bunch of things in there that I&#39;ve recently done, A high contrast Perpetua
    Display in 6 optical sizes &#40;for those of you who fancy those things&#41; and
    in particular a Roundhand script whose rights will revert back to me in 2005.
    I&#39;m busy working up a bunch of alternate glyphs for the OpenType it will become.
    I would post a sample, but Glamour has the exclusive rights to it till May 2005.

  body: The Font Bureau have also designed a number of typefaces for various magazines.
    David Berlow has done several. Tobias Frere-Jones did quite a few while he was
    there, before he joined up with Hoefler. Cyrus Highsmith has worked on a bunch.
    <BR> <BR>Magazines include <i>Traveler, Worth, Premiere, Newsweek</i> &#40;I don&#39;t
    think Carter&#39;s Vincent was ever used for Newsweek&#39;s text; are they still
    using FB Scotch for body copy?&#41;, <i>Esquire, Fast Company, Vibe, Martha Stewart
    Living.</i> I&#39;m sure there are others. <BR> <BR>If you track Roger Black&#39;s
    magazine redesigns, you&#39;ll find a trail of FB custom-developed typefaces.

    I don&#39;t think exclusivity would make it illegal or unethical for you to simply
    show a specimen. Could they really object to promotional samples on your website
    for example? BTW, did you have to get permission from Monotype to make the fonts?
    <BR> <BR>Kent, Newsweek is indeed using a Carter face now: Fenway. <BR>Two cuts,
    for text and display. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Stephanie, I would say that there are
    two factors that are specific to magazine faces: <BR>1&#41; Based on the typical
    point size used, they need to have an x-height that&#39;s somewhat large, but
    not ITC large. Like between news faces and book faces. <BR>2&#41; They tend to
    be more often sans than serif. Not sure why. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I&#39;m leaving on a short trip, so any samples will have to wait. Glamour
    is on the newsstand! As to permission from Monotype, I should have said Perpetua-like,
    since the fonts that Glamour were using originally were Bitstream versions of
    the design whose name I cannot remember...and since I started from scratch...used
    no one&#39;s data...and the fonts are named Glamour Serif...

  body: 'James, I checked out Glamour today. Typopgraphy-wise it looks busy, but they
    probably know what they&#39;re doing. As for the Perpetua, I think it&#39;s working
    great. Some questions: <BR>1&#41; Do you think they&#39;re actually going to the
    trouble of using the optical sizes properly? If you look at page 72 for example
    &#40;the May issue&#41;, there&#39;s at least three sizes of the type, but they
    all seem to be the same master. <BR>2&#41; Did they ask for the optical sizes,
    or is that something you convinced them was a good idea? <BR>3&#41; How did they
    choose Perpetua in the first place - did they ever verbalize a reason to you?
    I actually think it&#39;s a good -and interesting- choice, I&#39;m just wondering
    what their thought process was. <BR>4&#41; Are you sure Monotype doesn&#39;t mind?
    Sure, the data is from scratch, but stylistically it&#39;s totally Perpetua, no?
    On the other hand, the magazine owns a license to a version of the original, so...

  body: '&#62; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>It is busy, but that has always been Glamour&#39;s
    style. <BR> <BR>They were very specific about the Optical sizes they chose. I
    convinced them that it was possible to do, but it was something they wanted from
    the start, but were concerned about the cost. I presented them with a cascade
    of possibilities and they chose the various styles for the different sizes. <BR>
    <BR> I looked at an issue today at the airport, and I couldn&#39;t figure out
    any rhyme or reason to their current selection. <BR> <BR>They chose the Perpetua-like
    font all on their own. They did not explain their reasoning to me, nor did I ask
    for any. As I said in a previous post, ALL of this, in my experience is art director
    driven. <BR> <BR>Glamour, like all Conde-Nast books are very fastidious about
    font licensing. They own the proper license for the fonts they use. <BR> <BR>But
    I&#39;m most proud of the roundhand script I designed for them, but it seems they
    use very little of it these days. <BR> <BR>James <BR> <BR> '

  body: 'Great information thus far. Thanks to everyone!  <BR> <BR>A few more questions:  <BR>
    <BR>On the subject of art directors, any good ones with noticable track records
    that I should check out to get a good idea of their influence on type design?  <BR>
    <BR>Why is a high x-height used? Does it involve readability?  <BR> <BR>For that
    matter, are we talking about display type or text type? I would assume that readability
    is not as much of an issue with display type than it is with text type. In the
    case of display type, are there any deciding factors formally, or is style the
    main issue?  <BR> <BR>As for text type - how does the design of magazine text
    type differ from book text type? Are there any technical issues with the printing
    process that might require a special design, or is the design focused more on
    formal issues?  <BR> <BR>&#34;They tend to be more often sans than serif. Not
    sure why.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Hrant, is this in reference to text type? I seem to recall
    seeing mainly serif typefaces in most magazines &#40;at least in large bodies
    of text&#41;. Or are you speaking of display typefaces or something used for titles,
    headings, etc.?  <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the insight. I am a novice when it
    comes to type but am eager to learn more!'

  body: 'Stephanie, the issue of readability is extremely complex - to the point that
    it might not be understood within our lifetimes. But I think we can grasp parts
    of it, like the issue of vertical proportions &#40;especially x-height&#41;. On
    the other hand, you&#39;ll never get everybody to agree on the details! In fact
    the following explanation isn&#39;t something &#34;the establishment&#34; endorses
    &#40;but mostly because they simply haven&#39;t bothered to think about the issue
    enough - to take it seriously&#41;. <BR> <BR>Just like there&#39;s a duality between
    display and text type, there&#39;s a duality between legibility and readability.
    The former relies on the clear decipherability of individual symbols. As you say,
    it&#39;s easy to ensure decent legibility&#42;; you&#39;d have to make the text
    very small, the lighting very poor, or the letterforms extremely strange to reduce
    legibility substantially. This makes it fall in the realm of display typography,
    because people have plenty of time to decipher and compile the letters. But the
    latter &#40;readability&#41; deals with reading at the limits of performance,
    like when you&#39;re deep into a fast-paced novel, or trying to finish an article
    before an important meeting. In this case, the brain is more in a hurry, so it
    uses more of the retina, and relies more on its powerful heuristics to partly
    guess what the words are &#40;to speed things up&#41;&#42;&#42;. Part of the reason
    to rely on guesswork is that most of the surface of the retina has low resolution,
    so you can&#39;t even see the individual letters very well &#40;unless you take
    the time to look at all of them directly, but that slows things down unacceptably
    - and the point is unnecessarily&#41;. But you <i>can</i> see the outlines of
    words much deeper into the retina, and because these outlines -when taken in the
    context of &#34;expected&#34; phrases and grammatical structures- are enough to
    nail down the actual word, it works out geat. This means that such &#34;immersive&#34;
    reading relies more on ascenders and descenders in proportion to the x-height
    compared to &#34;deliberative&#34; reading. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which is why most people
    think any old font is fine for any setting. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; This is why typos
    are missed more in high-speed reading. <BR> <BR>So the optimal x-height for a
    given situation depends on the point it&#39;s at between pure legibility and pure
    readability. Take the case of a newspaper: because it&#39;s disposable, the paper
    is cheap, the point sizes are small; and then there&#39;s the fact that newspapers
    are often read while in motion, and in poor/variable lighting. All these things
    combine to make a good newspaper font to have a large x-height. But if you look
    at a book, it&#39;s read in much longer stints, in much more controlled environments,
    with less regard for economy; so a book face should have more generous extenders
    because more of  such reading is done &#34;immersively&#34;, so the outlines of
    words are more important than their &#34;brute&#34; size. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>As
    for the greater usage of sans in magazines, I suspect it&#39;s a cultural thing,
    not something driven by functionality, because serif fonts are more readable &#40;nominally&#41;
    for any decent amount of text. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
