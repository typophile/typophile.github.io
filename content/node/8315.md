  body: I&#39;m not very good with bezier curves and I can&#39;t seem to get the subtlty
    that I want without the forms looking fuzzy. Also, for some reason the dot on
    the &#34;i&#34; looks hollow unless you zoom in.

  body: 'Goals: well, I&#39;ve always wanted to make a font. One that is atypical,
    functional, and not ugly. <BR>Niche: I haven&#39;t a clue. <BR>Inspiration: The
    doodle I posted above, drawn in my notebook during a discussion of Rudolph Fisher&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0472064924/">The Conjure-Man
    Dies</a> in a seminar on literature of the Harlem Renaissance. Frimbo is the conjure-man&#39;s
    name. <BR>Basically, I feel a strange attraction to the forms of the alphabet
    and want to create. This font is a learning experiment but I&#39;d like the finished
    product to be worth the effort of learning. I am a bit discouraged, wondering
    if the characters I&#39;ve created so far look like they belong together and are
    well formed. If I can manage it I want to build a font with at least display,
    light, book, and black weights. And a full character set. But if it is mediocre
    &#40;or just plain bad&#41; then I don&#39;t want to spend the time creating a
    full range for a bad font.'

  body: The serifs remind me of those in various hanzi/kanji characters in the Song
    style. Your typeface could fit in well with them in bilingual headlines, etc.
    I think you should continue with it.

  body: Noah, one first thing you could try is to give the letters a similar finish.
    See how odd it looks when you have the H next to the E. You have at least three
    different styles of serif there. The serifs shouldn&#39;t be exactly the same
    in all letters, but they should harmonize. <BR> <BR>After that, you can work on
    the structures of the letters. I see that you&#39;ve made all letters the same
    width, but that leaves you with a excessively wide I, and a narrow H.

  body: The cap widths look a bit weird because you are not following either tradition.
    One is the classical which makes some within a square and some in half a square
    &#40;roughly&#41;. For this see Trajan and Futura. There the T E F is narrow and
    the H wide. In the 19th century they went for more similar width, so the E and
    H would be more similar width. Here you have a narrow T and a wide E, which looks
    strange.  <BR> <BR>There are no rules, just what you can make work. I like the
    idea for the serifs, but you might look at different caps that you like for inspiration
    on how to adjust their widths.
