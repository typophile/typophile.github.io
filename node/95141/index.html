		<div class="commentbody">I still disagree with the assumption, at least in its vague formulation.
However, I will point out that the concept of “development” itself is typically a western concept, and since latin alphabet is the western script of choice, saying that its typography is the “most developed” is something just short of a tautology.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Since the Latin alphabet has but 26 letters, it is clearly much easier to design a new font for it than it is for Chinese, Japanese, or even Korean.</p>
<p>Many other scripts, though, aren&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->much<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more complex than the Roman script; Thai, Tibetan, Devanagari, Burmese, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, and Amharic, as examples.</p>
<p>Here, &ldquo;more widely used&rdquo; is clearly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> factor. But another factor, not noted in the list given above, is that the Latin alphabet, being used in the United States and Western Europe, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is the alphabet of most of the world&rsquo;s richest countries<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Thus, there is more money to spend on developing new typefaces for newspapers, magazines, books, and advertising than in most other places. Japan is also a wealthy country, but its script has many more glyphs, and Israel, Georgia, and Armenia belong to the developed world as well, but their scripts belong only to one small country in each case.</p>
<p>Thus, if we confine ourselves to objective measures - the number of available typefaces, the economic importance of type design - the Latin alphabet is far ahead for obvious reasons. The objection that quantity is not quality can be made, however, and it&rsquo;s true that despite the handicaps noted, there are plenty of good typefaces available for many of the other script systems noted.</p>
<p>The Cyrillic and Greek scripts, which I didn&rsquo;t give as examples above, are less widely used than the Roman script as well, but they&rsquo;re so closely related that a large number of typefaces are shared between all three writing systems.</p>

<p>Latin: A B C D E F (G) H I (K) L M N O P Q R S T V X
English: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</p>
<p>Second: I don’t think that graphical aspects do count much here. Latin/English (bicameral!) is less complicated than Chinese but more demanding than e.g. Hebrew. So what?</p>
<p>Third: I think it has much to do with that:
– Roman imperialism – spread of the Latin alphabet;
– English colonialism – spread of the English alphabet;
– US-American … world dominance – further spread of the English alphabet.
There you go.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to speak of the English alphabet, because that would imply the Germans and the French and the Italians obtained their writing systems from the English-speaking countries, which, of course, is nonsense.</p>
<p>Even if we are responsible for the letters J and W. I&rsquo;m not sure we are, and I&rsquo;m quite certain U isn&rsquo;t a British invention, but instead originated on the Continent after the fall of Rome.</p>
<p>EDIT: W might have originated from uu in English; U, however, was definitely a Continental invention from the Middle Ages, and J, according to Wikipedia, turned up first in German, then Italian, and then French before the English borrowed it from them.</p>
<p>EDIT: It may also be noted that there is an urgent need to add the following letters to the Latin alphabet:</p>
<p>Бб, Гг, Дд, and Зз</p>
<p>&hellip;in order to replace b, g, d and z in Pinyin. In this way, the Latin alphabet will have b, б, and p as three distinct letters to properly represent the three consonants of this type in the Shanghai dialect, assigning the voiced one to English b, which it matches in sound.</p>
<p>Of course, without worrying about Chinese, just to represent the sounds used in English, we need to add</p>
<p>Жж, Чч, and Шш</p>
<p>Θθ is also needed, but here, instead of going to the Greek alphabet, we could just go to Icelandic (and older forms of English) to get Þþ.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Korean also has a three-way contrast between plosives (and even an affricate). They solve the issue nicely by just doubling the consonants. So the word for &ldquo;lid&rdquo;, 뚜껑 [t͈uk͈əŋ] with tensed t and k, is transcribed &ldquo;ttukkeong&rdquo;. With no need to borrow anything from Russian.</p>
<p>Foreigners here in Korea have enough trouble figuring out the existing Romanization, and it&rsquo;s quite simple. I can&rsquo;t imagine if they tried to add entirely new letters. Not to mention that no one would be able to type &ldquo;дuгeong&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The exact ideas in this thread were addressed by Henry Lewis Bullen a century ago in the passage quoted below. I find this passage really insightful. At the same time, the Orientalist assumptions expressed—typical of the time, 1912—are really distasteful in the context of colonialism.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;If we except the Greek capitals (which were parents of the Roman capitals) and Russian (which is also derived from the Greek), all other alphabets now in use are solely cursives, in the sense that they are constructed with the purpose of being readily produced by pen or brush, even in their most formal uses. Hebrew characters are&hellip; representative of hundreds of oriental alphabets similarly cursive in their structures, each of which conforms with an almost unvarying model. None of these lend themselves to decorative effects. While most of them are graceful, none afford scope to the designer; seemingly fluid, they are actually unyielding. They fitly typify the oriental civilizations, which, like their alphabets, had become stereotyped long before the invention of typography, and have remained practically unchanged ever since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opposed to these numerous and more ancient oriental cursive characters is the solitary roman letter model, structurally more severe and less graceful, seemingly less pliant, but actually more expressive. The roman letter is exactly typical of the ever-changing, ever-progressing occidental civilization; and probably the models of the characters by means of which the occidentals have been educated for centuries have had a stirring and beneficial psychological influence, which would have been lacking if Europe had adopted an alphabet purely cursive in its structure.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>And the innovations of employing contrast in layouts through mixing upright with italic (16th century) and different weights (regular with bold, 19th century) did not develop in the fraktur culture of northern Europe, which also used the Roman alphabet.</p>
<p>So it is the Antiqua which has developed typographically, not the Roman alphabet (Latin script) per se.</p>
<p>However, it could be argued that the Fraktur has developed more variety of letterform than the Antiqua, especially after perusing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fraktur Mon Amour<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. How much of this variety existed in fonts prior to the 20th century, or was it more of a script phenomenon?</p>
<p>Latin script scripts are something else again, but their development has been primarily outside typography.</p>

<p>Note that the use of the term &lsquo;roman&rsquo; to refer to a style of type and typography references not classical Rome but the development of the first humanist types by Sweynheim and Pannartz at Subiaco, just outside Rome, and then within the city itself. The Subiaco types have been described as &lsquo;half-Roman&rsquo;, i.e. somewhere between blackletter and the contemporary humanist book hand. The types they made in Rome after 1467 are the first &lsquo;roman&rsquo; types, and strongly influenced Jenson, who really established the style.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say that &lsquo;humanist&rsquo; and &lsquo;roman&rsquo; are entirely synonymous in the context of typography: the one describes the cultural origin and the other the geographical origin.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true; but presumably accented letters are confusing, and so each sound should have a separate letter all its own, rather than borrowing a letter for another sound just by putting an accent on it.</p>
<p>Instead, to avoid what happens with Vietnamese, accents would be reserved for use as tone marks - so that the Latin alphabet would be fully suited for writing Chinese, which is what started me on this.</p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to vowel sounds, on which I did not touch, wholesale borrowing from, say, Greek would be required in order to add extra vowels to the language. Maybe Armenian too!</p>
<p>The idea being to have something like the Shaw alphabet, but composed entirely of conventional and pre-existing letters. And with a few extra letters for non-English sounds like the German U-umlaut (also used in Chinese!) and the Russian yerry (Ыы).</p>

I understand your idea, so I agree with non-Latin additions like ж, ч, ш. But I deeply disagree with the &ldquo;Anglocentric&rdquo; approach. For example: English, French and Polish/German letter j represents 3 different sounds - џ, ж, j (that can be found in Serbian). Which spellings to reform? When you propose adding the extra letter ы to the alphabet (which sound is quite rare in English, indeed), you save English spelling (inconsistent here), while razing broad and consistent use of y in Polish, Czech and Slovak, where it sounds like ы &hellip;</p>
<p>Back to the topic: I think there have been means, good will and conducive atmosphere.</p>

You raise a good point. But I don&rsquo;t know how to address it.</p>
<p>If I add letters to the Latin alphabet in order to represent additional sounds in a phonetic manner, one sound being assigned to one letter, then clearly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an<!-- raw HTML omitted --> assignment of sounds to letters is being made.</p>
<p>And, as you&rsquo;ve pointed out, the pre-existing assignment of sounds to letters in different languages using the Latin alphabet differs. So, which letters to add and what sounds to assign to them would also differ.</p>
<p>I suppose that this could work, though, if the speakers of different languages reviewed their requirements independently, with the result being that some added letters - like some existing letters, most notably W in French - would not be used in all Latin-alphabet languages.</p>
<p>Note that I&rsquo;ve tried to address <!-- raw HTML omitted -->both<!-- raw HTML omitted --> foreign-language transliteration and spelling reform; both areas have different needs, even if additional letters seeming to be useful is common to both.</p>

And, of course, one interesting thing about it that is immediately obvious to the people on this forum is that the many new symbols added to the alphabet were all formed by turning existing letters upside-down, which, of course, did not require the expensive cutting of new symbols in the lead type era.</div>

By the way, I don&rsquo;t remember the details, but always when it comes to question about the success of the Roman typography, I recall the story of the first printer of Istanbul: After the Battle of Vienna, the ruler of the Ottoman Empire began to realize the failure and backwardness of the state. Then a Hungarian convert (I don&rsquo;t remember what his name was) entered the scene, offering printing technology, that could address the desired educational and informational issues. Since the introduction of printing could threaten mass riots (there were 3000 copyists employed in Istanbul), the Sultan agreed to print only the clearly secular materials. As can be easily guessed, the project has not led to success &hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Müteferrika was a Transylvanian Hungarian Unionist Protestant, who fled to the Ottoman Empire when the Austrian Catholic Habsburg Empire took over. Around that time he converted to Islam, which gave him access to Islamic script expertise, the key for creating acceptable Arabic typography for the Ottoman Empire. Previous printers of Arabic in Europe and (potential) Arabic printers in the Middle East (Jews, Greeks and Armenians in Istanbul and Syriac and and Catholic Christians in Syria-Lebanon) did not have this expertise - which apparently was very difficult to acquire for non-Muslims.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lJsfUQ-qqw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lJsfUQ-qqw</a>
The Ottoman authorities were keenly aware of the strategic importance of what we would now call Information Technology, but they were less then impressed by the graphic atrocities resulting from unfamiliarity with Islamic script practice.  According to Orlin Sabev, the Ottoman Authorities had no issue acquiring any technology from unbelievers as long as it served their purpose: the Ottoman armed forces were the first in the world to be fully equipped with fire arms, therefore opposition to printing was not motivated by Islam but by functionality: type without the correct script architecture was useless. The Ottomans were in fact keen on mass producing the Koran, if possible using printing technology, as that could be a powerful tool in spreading Islam (unlike the Catholic authorities, who discouraged the laymen to read the Holy Books). However, although Müteferrika&rsquo;s type was structurally sound - unlike Eurabic and Syrian-Lebanese efforts, which broke many rules of Islamic script architecture - the calligraphic quality was not up to Koranic standards. That is why it was not allowed to be used for religious work. Consequently, Müteferrika printed mainly strategic materials (dictionaries, atlases, grammars, descriptions of foreign lands, etc). Following the closure of Müteferrika&rsquo;s printing shop, work continued with the same or very similarly structured typefaces. According to Uğur Derman, Ottoman Sultan Selim III was so concerned about the low quality of Arabic type, that he ordered the best Ottoman typographer/punch-cutter of his realm - yes! an Armenian - Poghos Araboğlu (<a href="http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/g_brief_08.php">http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/g_brief_08.php</a>) to cut punches after the calligraphy of Hattat Deli Osman Efendi (quoting Derman off the top of my head).  This produced a much better result, but it was indeed the Armenian Hovhannes/Ohanes Mühendisyan/Mühendisoğlu who created the breakthrough for the acceptance of Arabic type throughout the Ottoman domains (1866).</p>
<p>Summarizing, there was a three-stage development of Arabic typography with the required script architecture, each of them the result of interaction by a typographic using Western technology with direct access to Islamic script expertise:</p>
<ol>
<li>1730&rsquo;s - Müteferrika, a polymath familiar with typography but most likely not an experienced printer himself, who was able to learn the basics of Arabic calligraphy (from experts) after his conversion to Islam, but he did not succeed in getting the aesthetics right. He only worked on naskh/nesih, which he managed to reproduce structurally correct, but not well shaped.</li>
<li>1790&rsquo;s - Araboğlu, a famous Armenian printer, was ordered to work with Deli Osman. I am still studying the nature of his work, but clearly it was not the breakthrough. It is remarkable that, apart from naskh/nesih, he worked on (nas)ta`liq - one of the key scripts of the period.</li>
<li>1860&rsquo;s - Mühendisoğlu, the dean of Armenian printers and creator of impressive (nas)ta`liq type, closely collaborated with the top calligrapher of his day, Mustafa Izzet Efendi on naskh/nesih. I do not know yet what the nature of their relationship and collaboration was. From the material in my possession it is visible that, though Mühendisoğlu cut all the necessary sorts for a perfect rendering of Islamic script structure, his mastery of the system was imperfect. He frequently uses correct forms in positions where they do not belong. Clearly it took an Islamic upbringing to master this writing system.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of them ever printed the Koran, but I do have a Lebanese printed Gospel dating from the 1890&rsquo;s in a Mühendisyan (derived?) typeface.</p>
<p>The first typeset Koran was printed in Russia in the end of the 18th century probably by and/or for the Saint Petersburg Tatar Turkic community, with type imported from Germany that had all the typical European defects. The same type was still in use in Kazan (capital of Tatarstan) in the early 1990&rsquo;s. The same typographic style is used by Russian orientalists for Persian texts, notably the first volume of the two part Персидско-Русский Словарь by М.А. Гаффаров. It forms the basis of the persian flavour os simplified naskh, called kitabi.</p>
<p>The first typeset Koran in the Arabic world was printed in Egypt after the collapse of the Ottoman world, in 1924. Apparently, the Ottoman objections against inferior script architecture were dropped in favour of orthographic precision (tajweed), see:
<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9225177/Cairo_Koran_Orthographic_Rules_FINALoct2009.pdf">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9225177/Cairo_Koran_Orthographic_Rules_FINALoct2009.pdf</a>
The typeface used for this Koran conforms dramatically better to Arabic script architecture than what is used by Dutch, German and French printers. It is claimed to be cut after the handwriting of the great Ottoman calligrapher Abdülaziz Efendi. However, while there is a visible relationship between Mühendisoğlu&rsquo;s nask/nesih and Mustafa Izzet Efendi&rsquo;s calligraphy, there is no such match between this typeface and the hand of Aziz. Moreover, e.g., a publication printed in Vienna (Theodor Nöldeke&rsquo;s Zur Grammatic des classischen Arabisch) in 1897 uses a very similar, Mühendisoğlu-inspired typeface - minus the necessary Islamic script architecture: like in Mühendisoğlu&rsquo;s case, all the shapes seem to be there, but, typical for Europeans, the awareness of the system was absent.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s of course the other way around: the technology emerged in a Roman world and primarily adapted for Latin script.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It certainly is true that the technology was developed in areas that used the Latin script. However, except for Georgian, which avoids the need for lower case, you can&rsquo;t get much simpler than the version of the Latin script used in the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>Arabic, Devanagari, Korean, Chinese - they all require more flexibility or more glyphs. So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to say that had typewriters or Monotype casters been invented first in those parts of the world, they would have served those languages well, at the same cost and complexity as the Latin alphabet was served - which would have to be true if the apparent claim, that the difficulties experienced with those scripts are solely the result of the technology being developed in a provincial manner, and not at all the result of intrinsic characteristics of the scripts themselves.</p>
<p>However, while that was true in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->past<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, our present-day difficulties with those languages <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I have to admit, primarily due to provincialism. Painting characters on a screen or a laser printer is inherently very flexible, and so if such things as the OpenType spec are designed in a way that some of these languages are awkward to handle properly, if the simplest way to handle them involves redundant glyphs, and so on&hellip; then that is correctable, and would not have arisen if people knowledgeable about those scripts were involved from the beginning.</p>
<p>So I think that you seem to be making a point that is only valid if a very important qualification is added.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, while the three examples you give were created in the West, I think it is a mistake to characterise them all as &lsquo;offshoots of roman type development&rsquo;. In the case of Tom Milo&rsquo;s Arabic system, this is a technology based on close analysis of Ottoman Arabic manuscripts made by people who have no background or interest in &lsquo;roman type development&rsquo;. One of the reasons it is such an innovative system is that it does not rely on any paradigms from Latin script technologies, for the simple reason that Tom and his partners have never worked within those paradigms.</div>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technology never emerges &ldquo;by accident&rdquo;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume this is intended as a criticism of my latest response to Thomas Milo in this thread.</p>
<p>It certainly is true that Johann Gutenberg had the intention of typesetting texts in Latin and German, not texts in Arabic or Chinese. Hence, how dare I assume that had the latter been his intention instead, he might not have found some way to do that which would be equally easy to achieve?</p>
<p>Some guy named Pi Sheng seems to be pulling at my sleeve at this point&hellip;</p>
<p>Movable type was first invented in China, after all, but it didn&rsquo;t succeed quite as well there because of the large number of characters the language had.</p>
<p>Yes, technologies are invented by people, with the intention of obtaining specific results. But that it is simpler to deal with a limited number of glyphs that combine in a trivial fashion, rather than the other cases, when not using modern electronic technology is not a cultural construct; it is a fact of life.</p>
<p>In fairness, though, I should note that I remember reading, long ago in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Datamation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, about how someone, by applying a little ingenuity, managed to make a computer line printer (not dot-matrix, but formed character, like a daisywheel or a typewriter) print in the Korean script.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I want to express my deepest respect for the work of Mr Milo or Mr Papazian. Sorry if it felt otherwise. I am not a specialist in the matter, I just meant to ask some questions. I was notified offline that Thomas is well aware of the problem that Unicode encodes characters and not graphemes.</p>
<p>On the technology aspect, of course there is the aspect of lead, and oil based paint or ink. There is also the need for motivation to find something new, etc. Of course the Chinese and the Koreans were centuries earlier and maybe Europeans just copied the technique. Until quite recently, many countries in Europe claimed the invention of the printing press before Gutenberg, and decades before printing, &ldquo;handwritten&rdquo; books were mass produced - so if it had not been for Gutenberg, it would surely have been somebody else. If we consider Mesopotamian clay tablets, printing was about as early as writing.</p>
<p>But I was more thinking about non technological elements: the rapid growth of internal and external markets, of a new and sometimes rebellious middle class, the necessity of propaganda, the need for a workforce that could read. And then later the economic need for adding design to products and the birth of art in the modern sense of the word.</p>
<p>I also fail to see the problem with a Western writing system surpressing non Western systems, on the condition that it is not combined with personal alienation or discrimination. But maybe that is an even more difficult discussion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Latin was a foreign language in Europe at least after the Roman classical period: it was used as vehicular language for European (religious) intellectuals until modern times. The separation between Latin or &ldquo;Popular Latin&rdquo; and e.g. French or Italian is indeed a complex story, but in most parts of Europe, it was never anybody&rsquo;s mother tongue. This—I suppose—could have been a factor in the evolution of the Roman Cursive into e.g. Carolingian.
In the 16th century, Roman was in some areas typically used for Latin, while Fractura or Italic or Civilité were used for popular language.

		<div class="commentbody">Sure, but the difference between now and then is that there were no or very few texts in any other language. First known text in &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; e.g. is from about 1100. Hence my point that writing was done basically in a foreign language. Literacy of course was very low in those days – we have all seen Monty Python – and maybe this could have had an influence on how a writing system and later typography developed. Maybe the fact that Roman was less language specific made it more suitable as an export product for other languages – Indonesian not to be the least.</div>

<p>This was in 7th century Germany or thereabouts, according to Wikipedia. Maybe England, maybe 8th century.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since w replaced uu, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called double-u, even though it&rsquo;s pointy at the bottom. What it looks like is two v&rsquo;s side by side, so, naturally, that&rsquo;s what the French would call it, not having the history with uu.</p>
