  a display face to experiment with. Specifically, I'm looking for something something
  rough, raw; the sort of typeface that would beat you up in an alleyway. Part brute,
  part showman. The album has lots of connotations to religion and an underlying spaghetti
  western/military feel here and there. The band's point of reference was\u2014half
  jokingly\u2014the Wu Tang logo, at least in terms of its over-the-top brutish qualities.
  Apologies if this is all terrifically vague!\r\n\r\nAs far as the project goes,
  it's for a folk/drone record with a ton of distortion and odd experimental sounds,
  and it'll be a digital print with a colour palette of two or three. \r\n\r\nAny
  more information that would be useful, let me know! But anything you could suggest
  would be hugely appreciated. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJez"
