<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm back, but I am desperate. :-)
I have Perla alternate (lower case) as my logotype - first question, would it look too confusing and "messy" to pick another font for the word "Collections" and for the names of the collections, or should I go with Perla all the way? The problem is that it's very hard to read it when it's a smaller size and it has to be smaller than the first page on the web site. And secondly, would it be even more confusing to choose two different fonts for the two collections and keep the rest of the text in something neutral like "Century gothic" or something more "clean"? I've been thinking about this -after someone suggested it to me - and it is a good alternative to the fact that I didn't managed to get symbols for the two collections.
If I should just go for Perla all the way except for the rest of the text, can anyone suggest a font that would match? Thank you!! :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Perla is expressive enough that you might in fact need another font between it and the text sizes, at least onscreen. I'd try a low-contrast Didone, like maybe this:

<div class=commentbody>It's customary to keep a logotype reserved for "special" purposes only. So you could certainly go with another face for headings and subheads. There are many that would work with Perla.
Storm's Walbaum is a great choice, or Emigre's Filosofia (I hear the spacing is improved). Both look nice on screen. Or a geometric sans like Proxima Nova, Gotham, Avenir, Futura for a different effect. That's your call.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I'm thinking Filosofia is probably a better choice than Storm's Walbaum-Text.
For one thing it's narrower, which is almost always a plus onscreen. Plus it's a
lot more elegant, without going for high contrast.
BTW what's your HTML body face [first] choice, Georgia?

you have probably already seen this, but i thought this worked rather well with Perla.

<div class=commentbody>I wouldn't use a font like Filosofia which is close in spirit to Perla. I'd go with a sans that has a similar shape. Seb's example is a good one.</div>

<div class=commentbody>All about seb - I haven't actually - in fact I'd never
seen Perla prior to finding it when I was looking for a font for my logo. What's the name of the font in the picture? Yes, it does make a nice match with Perla. Like all the other suggestions - they're clean and simple. I don't think one should pick a font that could or should "compete" with Perla. :-)

<div class=commentbody>Pattyfab - I've always prefered styles like the fonts that were suggested earlier, like Filosofia and Didone, but maybe Perla
should be "matched" with a sans.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Pattyfab - Thanks! The only font I might recognise by just
looking at it is probably Garamond. And maybe Modern no 20.
You people are good. :-) Avatar? Never heard of that one.

I removed the picture because of the very
unpleasant situation due to the enfant terrible
thread. I felt harassed and having a
picture of myself on display made me feel exposed.

<div class=commentbody>hrant - I never intended to be part of this forum again. But
then I ran into the problems with my font which to me was
a disaster. I'm racing against the clock to get this web site
launched because selling jewelry is my sole income now and I
had no one else to ask for help. But when you and others asked
me to post an image of the logo, a person who works with me
on this (with marketing) advised me against it. He thought I
risked having someone else "steal" the name. I have - as you
know - previously posted the names of the collections
and several pictures of my jewelry (probably not that smart
either) and was actually cautioned by someone at Typophile
to get the rights before another company stole my ideas. So I
told the truth and that was the main reason not to do it.
But having said that, I'm sure you're right too. Part of me
doesn't want to reveal anything more about me because of
what happened, which is really sad, because that's not who
I am and that's not how I felt when I first became a
member. But I'm not trying to hide - if I'd wanted to do that
I could just have created a new account.
