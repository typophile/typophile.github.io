      state of the aesthetic of half of the country, or because there's a lack of
      proper education? It's a sad thing, I preflighted a Prentic Hall book on desktop
      publishing a few weeks ago, and it recommended Times as a book font!\r\n\r\nIn
      my opinion, the most popular font is dependant of the medium. The TV/Movie industry
      doesn't make use of Times as much, but boy they love their Trajan. Drop by any
      movie rental place, and you could create a large section of the place with DVDs
      with some deviation of Trajan used for the titling font. My girlfriend is even
      sick of it, and she has no design/typography background whatsoever. "

  body: "Casey,\r\nI think Times is so popular because it has been bundled with every
    Mac and Windows machine since the 80s and is the default face for MS Word (and
    numerous other non-decision reasons). Most people don't pay much attention to
    typefaces. They just go with the default.\r\nTrajan might have started out as
    a correct choice for some Roman era spectacular film which ended up with big box
    office. Later, producers trying to promote their film as having \"Big Boxoffice\"
    wanted to use Trajan to give it that look of success. Even if the film had nothing
    to do with Ancient Rome and made no sense, it was a \"me too\" kinda thing. I
    can see \"The Robe\", Spartacus\", and the like, using Trajan but now it is down
    right silly to see it on anything and everything coming out of Hollywood. Times
    and Trajan are good typefaces but just because you own a nice tuxedo doesn't mean
    you wear it to wash your car. :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: Chris, I have to agree with you on that. I wonder how many desktop users
      really have a preference of what typeface they're using anyway. Hopefully Vista
      will have an influence on the amount of exposure for Times. I have to admit,
      when I started out in computer engineering I can't say I was going out of my
      way to choose a typeface in MS Word. If I had stayed that course, I don't suppose
      things would have changed. Maybe the typical high school spec sheet (12 pt.
      Times New Roman or points deducted) had some influence on that..

    \ I guess today's Hollywood producers are consistant at least, instead of coming

    be why the independent films are so much better that the old studios, they actually
    try to make new films instead of resurecting old ones (and they are not run by
    committees of micromanagers). They are the same with type--just go back and use

    a lot of municipal signage. NZ Telecom adopted Bliss a couple of years ago, and
    maybe set a small trend for it. Although one of the local freight companies uses
    Comic Sans on all of their big trucks, I don't see it so much anymore. The place

    it should only be used at smaller point sizes.
