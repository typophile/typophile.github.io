  that is loose, neat but quite masculine at the same time (definitely not girly and
  romantic that kind of typefaces). I found it bit hard to find. I have been scrolling
  through myfonts\u2026  I am near to dead end. \r\n\r\nIt will be used for a tagline
  of an Industrial/building products. It will say 'When Experience Matters'. \r\n\r\nYour
  suggestions would be very much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you.  "

    for each character, make sure you modify the 'T's and 'E's to make it more like
    real writing.\r\n\r\nThat said, real writing is probably the best way to go. Hire
    a lettering artist. Might not be that much more expensive than a font, and you'll
    get something authentic and unique to your company."

  body: Nick, OIWON is exceedingly cool, but I really think you should go all out
    to get the entry stroke into "e" smooth in every instance, and at a consistent
    angle, for a completely natural cursive simulation. Sure, it's a ton of work doing
    alternates for multiply-accented characters, but it will be worth it.

    Thank you so much, you are giving such an important point here. I just realised
