body: Does anybody know why there are no copies of <strong> Learn FontLab Fast </strong>
  by Leslie Cabarga, for sale online anymore. I mean NOBODY seemes to have any. Is
  it because there is a new version for FL 5.0?

    all you need do is read the blurb on the back of the book to get a preview of
    his writing style.\r\n\r\n>Is it because there is a new version for FL 5.0?\r\n
    \r\nThe blurb says the book is for versions 4.6 and 5.0 but a second edition would
    be great!\r\n\r\nSi"

    goodness I bought it for. :-P\r\n\r\nLeslie said that Open type isn't really the
    focus of the book per se even if it does deal with it a little. Still, I am betting
    that there are insights, even if they deal mostly with production & working techniques
    waiting there for me.\r\n\r\nWell, I'll let you know what I think after I get
    it & try it out I suppose... \r\n\r\n"

    We spoke on the phone several times and I taught Leslie a few things about the
    dark sides of font technology. \r\n\r\nBut quite frankly, I have lived to see
    four spreads from the book. When I first saw pages 50 to 57, it was like a revelation
    to me. I was always a bit confused about drawing in FontLab myself until Leslie
    laid it out to me on these four spreads. This is the most comprehensive overview
    of drawing in FontLab and so much to the point. \r\n\r\nAltogether, every single
    page of the book is useful. \r\n\r\nLeslie's writing style shows off when you
    read the back cover of the book. But you should wish you had seen the alternate
    biographies for him and me that he originally planned to put there. That was completely
    insane stuff! :) \r\n\r\nGo grab a copy while Leslie still has some! \r\n\r\nBest,
    \r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

    be a v. 2.0 of Learn Fontlab Fast? i was thinking of buying the current edition,
    but i can't find it here in Europe and having read somewhere that he's working
    on a new edition i might as well hold off for that one.
