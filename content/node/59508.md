body: "Dear typophiles,\r\nI'm looking for an ID on the grotesk typeface in the following
  two pictures. It is used by Fogal, a Swiss stockings company, for their packaging.
  I doubt that they'd have a custom typeface, but maybe that's the solution.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fogal_caresse_5726.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fogal_madison_6142.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!"

  body: "I'd say House Neutraface. [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrafaceno2/viewfonts|Neutraface
    No. 2]] includes a more 'normal' E. There are a lot of weights and variations
    in the complete Neutraface superfamily. With a bit of graphic manipulation I am
    sure you could come very close, if not an exact match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "raf, it's none of those. they all have a flat A-peak, so they're out from
    the beginning.\r\n\r\nmike, i doubt it is neutraface. it was my first thought
    but this packaging existed for 4+ years so if it wasn't a custom alteration, i
    couldn't have been neutraface.\r\n\r\nthanks for the help thus far though!"

  body: sadly none of those is it. Neutraface would've been altered REALLY heavily,
    for example the S is completely different (more in the FF Bau / Trade Gothic Extended
    range). both of those clearly don't fit the M/A of the typeface above though.

  body: "I think this is driving us to the conclusion that it is custom, but just
    to show what even a very clumsy editing job can do with Neutraface 1, see the
    sample attached. I converted the letters to outlines, and manipulated (badly)
    the S points, as well as the R counter and E arm.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FogalSim_5767.gif]"
