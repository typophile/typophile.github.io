body: "Hi, typophiles-\r\nI'm working on a website for a lawyer friend, and had paired
  Trade Gothic (Bold Condensed No.20, a personal favorite) with Bulmer Italic to try
  to balance the forcefulness of the Trade Gothic. I am fond of the pairing, but my
  client doesn't like the Bulmer- she wants something less \"cursive-y.\"  I tried
  some serif small cap typefaces to look more legal-esque, but they look too pretentious
  to me. I want to keep the approachable feeling I think I had going with my original
  pairing. Any suggestions?\r\nMany thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lawyer_5811.png]"

    in a book project, which turned out quite well.
