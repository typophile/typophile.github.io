I'm sure you can understand that 'defining good' is an impossible task, in any field. Even philosophs can't define good.

But in graphic design, there are books that are references. For exemple, Grid System is a design bible, like The Elements of Typographic Style or Counterpunch. Most of us can agree with this.

So i'm searching books that have the same universal quality and that can be a reference for stationary. I doubt there is one, but for sure some must be better than others. So all designers that are interested in letterheads etc. must have searched for this and can share there conclusions.

Me as i said, i found nothing really helpfull but the Designer’s Sationery from Roger Walton. But really its not as timeless and wellmade as we can hope.

+ Something i don't like in letterheads books too, as, to me, it often look very american, and for me (european, and french) it really look exotic and unusable (the image i posted is a an exemple).

-

Thanks for your references.
• I was wondering about the Carter one, i need to check it in a library.
• about LETTERHEADS: One Hundred Years of Great Design, 1850-1950. The cover look VERY american to me and well it seems something more historic-centred so it can be interesting in this perspective.

I'm suprprise too that any book seems to be interested in elaboring rules and technical requests on this topic. (cause in this area it seems there are very important !)</div>

Just for reference. But i don't think you can find it brand new.
I'm not sure i would recomend it either. Its just not as bad as…
+ its not about designing letterhead for big corps or anything, but still interesting (the layout is terrible btw)

Hmm...I'd probably agree. I'm not sure there really is any tried and true rules of stationery. Whatever works, seems to work.

In many ways, stationery is going the way of annual reports...</div>

A definition of good design and printing could be relative to the time dedicated to craft a design and the print.

One thing I know, if your stationery is printed letterpress, patiently plated and printed, even a bad design can look good.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there, about a decade ago AIGA sponsored an exhibit on engraved letterhead and the accompanying catalog is the best I have ever seen. 

Today, my graphic design business is devoted to engraving which is even finer than letterpress for beautiful type.  Buddy up with an engraving company (there are few anymore so find one now before they all go away.)

FYI: In America, the trade term "engraving" refers to any intaglio printing process but most is actually etched, not engraved.  You can go to my website for some looks and tips.

Please let me know if anyone is interested in knowing about engraving, it has been my area of interest since graduate school in the late 70s and is now my formal academic area of research.  I teach graphic design, graphic design history and typography and use the historic model of engraving as the base for almost everything I teach.  So, if anyone wants information of it (including monograms, cyphers and etc.,) just ask.

James: you are lucky, there are still a couple of engraving shops in the D.C. area.  Next time I am there I will be giving a mid-day lecture on monograms and engraving at an architectural firm.  I will post it on this blog site so you will know.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Nancy,

Wow! I have been on your site and I love it! I bookmarked it.
The fine details on illustrations... Metal plates are optimal for fine details and don't get busted by pressure.
As you know today's letterpress goes mostly with photopolymer plates. In my case I realized that photopolymer is good, if the thinner details are not smaller then 0.3 of a point. When reproducing screens, the line screen amount is low, around 50 lpi.
I remember back in the seventies the shop I worked for used brass plates for long run jobs, and also for fine detail and screened jobs.
I believe that are people out there who recognizes printed art when they see it.
Lucky You!
