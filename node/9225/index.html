I started with Legacy. - they said it wasn't ledgible. (Its an abbrev. inside a crest where the entire organization name is going to be printed underneath on their forms&hellip;for crying out loud.) but its not ledgible they say&hellip;and some member got a creative hat on and found Shelley on his PC, passed it around and now their set on it. I refused - especially with their layout of it (diagonal decending scale of character overlaped and everything - I refrained from a freak out where I would have screamed about ledgibility. t h e y are telling m e this is more ledgible!? but I see its that old problem. whatever is on the PC operating system is ledgible. So, in a panic moment realizing they were about to reck my crest, I said I'd try something more &quot;Shelley&quot; to go in the crest - but after my merge of Legacy and Shelley-esque features its all gone wrong. <BR> <BR>can it be salvaged? do you see any potential? there's something about the finishes that's just not consistant. suggestions would be helpful. thanks <BR></div>

Mainly I see a problem with the &quot;F&quot;. It looks like an &quot;S&quot; to me. If indeed it is an &quot;F&quot; it looks too much like a lower case &quot;f&quot;.  It should be as important as the &quot;O&quot; and the &quot;D&quot;.   <BR>    <BR>The second one looks arabic, the dots are too much for me and the first, I think reaches (sorry) illegibility.    <BR>    <BR>Clients can be (are) a bitch.    <BR>    <BR>-smc</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that is funny that people think that 3-D is more &quot;professional&quot; or  finished&quot;. Every client should have access to Kai's Power Tools. Just Kidding. That would be lame. <BR> <BR>Perhaps it is too late, or your just plain done with it, but I think that the black type on the red could be lacking contrast. I don't have my Pantone book here so I could be wrong. But I have used black and this color before. <BR> <BR>I think knocking the &quot;ODF&quot; out, like the bottom one, might have a bit more punch. And I was wondering how it might look without the black frame. I guess what I am describing would be the bottom one- but red. <BR> <BR>Anyway, guess we  can't expect every client to see with the same set of eyes that we see with. Over all, designing and getting paid for it keeps me happy and I hope it does you. If you think about it, we get paid to draw. What more could you ask? <BR> <BR>-smc</div>

There's a lot of mistakes in here still and while I had thought this was going to be a great opportunity where I could submit it here there and everywhere&hellip;(well really when don't I start thinking of all the greatness any project could be) its all been crushed &amp; comprimised. <BR> <BR>to your second point though - I could transform this into a moral, ethical discussion about design&hellip;.but suffice to say that I don't think our job is so easy to say we get paid to draw anymore then an architect gets paid to play with toothpicks. but I get your drift and it made me happy for a few. <BR> <BR>is that D so Disney or what. ahhhhh maybe I shouldn't look at it anymore</div>
