<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone, I am new to the site. I am a graphic designer, I am overhauling my portfolio, which, up until now has been actual final pieces glued on paper and put in sleeves.
It's come to my attention that this is very "straight out of school" and so I am looking for a smaller, sleeker portfolio to show to potential freelance clients and potential employers.
I've been looking at the following:
http://www.pzdirect.com/34viscposetf7.html
I like the 11x17 size, I like that it's screw post and not a binder, and the pages seem to be transparent and durable.
However, if you know of an awesome portfolio that I can purchase online, I'd love to hear about it. I am just starting to shop for one, and don't know what's out there.
Thanks for any info!

<div class=commentbody>Mine is from Veer. I love it. Every interview I've been on since I started using has resulted in the interviewer complimenting the actual portfolio. Which either says a lot for the portfolio or not much about my work. ha. It's only 11x14 though.

<div class=commentbody>I just bought a $5.00 A4 portfolio by Muji at the MoMA design store. It’s just like the generic cheap plastic portfolios art stores sells, but with translucent covers that make the whole thing seem really classy. I’m looking forward to dumping my 18"x24" portfolio for this one.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I personally never use something with plastic sleeves in it. They reflect light, which makes the work inside hard to see.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the look of the brushed-metal number. Very smart. I'm sure I've seen a Muji equivalent of it, but I could be wrong.
I have two portfolios, one for my design work and another for my photography. For the design work I use the [[http://www.londongraphics.co.uk/acatalog/PRAT_Pampa_Spiralbooks.html|Pratt Pampa series]]. They're not cheap (and London Graphics certainly aren't -- theirs was just the first link I found) but they're good quality, using thick, fine-grain leather and have a velvety inside. They use clear pockets, so there is a glare issue, but they look smart for years. I have a couple of them, my current one is about 5 yeas old and still looks quite new. The A4 version is best, because it's small enough to throw into a bag. Why bother lugging a big thing around ...
For the photograps I use archival polyester sleeves stacked loose in a portfolio box. Looks smart. Nice to lay flat open and move prints from one side to the other. Unlike the Pratt A4 book, this is far less portable. I print everything 16x12" and use a deep-ish box. I've got a carrying case for it all which though ugly, but does the job well. I use [[http://www.silverprint.co.uk/|Silverprint for all this stuff.]] They're great, but I reckon you can get 'em elsewhere too.
There's a London/UK bias here I realise.</div>
