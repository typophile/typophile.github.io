  I've tested on both platforms all applications, kerning, spacing. Mircosoft font
  validator, AFDKO. \r\n\r\nI'm a little concerned that I'm going to forget something,
  so I think a check list is the safest way, but now I'm worried I'll forget something
  on the check list. Any ideas or suggestions about what needs to be on my list.\r\n\r\nR"

    formats and platforms, and the sequence might be different depending on the tools
    used."

  body: "(Warning, I'm assuming you're generating OpenType CFF fonts, only.)\r\n\r\nWhich
    AFDKO tools have you used? I'd say you should at least use <strong>CompareFamily</strong>,
    but it won't hurt if you ran your fonts through <strong>CheckOutlines</strong>,
    and do some proofs of the OT tables and GPOS/GSUB features with <strong>spot</strong>.
    The AFDKO includes several tools if you want to be more thorough (e.g. you can
    test the fonts' rasterization with <strong>waterfallplot</strong>, and do some
    other proofs with <strong>tx</strong>).\r\n\r\nHere are a few useful commands:\r\n<code>comparefamily
    -d /Folder_TestFont -rn -rm -rp > CF_output.txt\r\ncheckoutlines font.otf > CO_output.txt\r\nspot
    -P liga test.otf > liga.ps\r\nwaterfallplot font.otf\r\ntx -pdf -1 test.otf >
    glyphset.pdf\r\n</code>"

  body: All I have are Fontographer 4.1.5, FontForge and the AFDKO, but that's just
    my personal setup. I haven't yet tried the latter, though. Thanks for the tips.

  body: All the tools I mentioned ARE part of the AFDKO. So, if you have the latest
    version correctly installed, you should have access to all of them.
