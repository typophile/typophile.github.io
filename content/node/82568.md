  Generate Fonts dialog, the Web Open Font Format is always greyed out (see attached

  file. Are there any prerequisites for generating a WOFF I am forgetting? \r\n\r\n"

  body: According to may May 1 2010 sources, woff is deactivated if FontForge can't
    find [[http://zlib.net/|zlib]]. On what system are you using FontForge?

    is already installed.\r\nEven so, why is it greyed out? Shouldn't it display an
    error message in such a case?"

  body: "<cite>Shouldn't it display an error message in such a case?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    guess so. Here are two lines I grepped somewhere in the sources that should generate
    some message:\r\n<code>\r\nff_post_error(_(\"WOFF not supported\"), _(\"This version
    of fontforge cannot handle WOFF files. You need to recompile it with libpng and
    zlib\") );\r\nff_post_error(_(\"WOFF not supported\"), _(\"Could not find the
    zlib library which is needed to understand WOFF\") );\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nMichel"
