body: Hi! <BR>I was looking for the name of one of my fonts at Google and found it
  at <a href="http://www.fontpool.com" target="_blank">www.fontpool.com</a>. <BR>This
  site has nothing to offer than links to MyFonts, which might be okay, but is it
  legal to copy all the font samples from MyFonts &#40;or from anywhere else&#41;
  and publish them on a site without a license? <BR>I would like to ask the webmaster
  but I couldn&#39;t find  an imprint on this site, not even an eMail address. <BR>

    MyFonts employee. I believe he ran the site long before  <BR>MyFonts was born.

  body: One of the things that bothers me about this site &#40;aside from the obvious
    lack of tact on MyFonts part for allowing a conflict of interest by having an
    internal employee have a click-link site earning commissions&#41; is that FontPool
    is utilizing information not otherwise available to MyFont designers and foundries
    can be improper to disclose. I am speaking of the sales rank for a given family
    which is only found for the top 50 or so on the MyFonts website, but on the FontPool
    website is disclosed for all families. I find it a bit disturbing that MyFonts
    chooses to disclose this information to third parties without permission nor without
    offering it to the designers themselves. <BR> <BR>Does Nick Shinn WANT people
    to know that Alphaville is the 4,475th most popular of 8,500 families that MyFonts
    sells? I would think not. Does Nick Curtis want people to know that Boogaloo &#40;the
    face name that Berthold went after Bitstream for $$$$ on&#41; is the 4,357th seller?
    I would think not. Does Bitstream want people to know that their version of Americana
    is the 1,602nd most popular, while the Linotype is 492nd, the Elsner &#43; Flake
    is 2,782nd, the Scangraphic 1,664th, and the URW&#43;&#43; 4,198th? Again, I would
    think not.  These examples can go on and on. <BR> <BR>While I appreciate that
    the individual sales of any typeface are not astronomical, this type of information
    can be used to extrapolate what most would consider proprietary data. It&#39;s
    really irresponsible of MyFonts to allow this abuse of privacy.

  body: I find it unfathomable that &#34;MyFonts,&#34; or in this case, Bitstream,
    would not know about this site. Therefore, it must be legit. I MyFonts makes money
    from the referrals, then it is probably OK with them anyway. Just a guess
