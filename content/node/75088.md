  body: "The Intellecta foundry has produced some revivals of traditional \"line-drawing
    illustrations of letters made from pieces of wood\" typefaces.\r\nI think that
    people expect \"Real Wood\" fonts to be similarly naturalistic or representational.\r\nBut
    your typeface, to its credit, is an original concept and a new stylization.\r\nYou
    do it a disservice to describe it in the same manner as Intellecta's unimaginative
    and unoriginal history-mining.\r\nI would say \"Wood Never Looked Like This Before!\"
    or possibly, if you're feeling on top of the world, \"Wood Never Looked So Good!\""
