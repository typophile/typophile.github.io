    <BR> <BR>A suprising number of Universities have their ID/Graphics systems online.
    Use Google and Search <b>University Identity</b> and <b>University Graphic Identity</b>.
    These can be good when well done because they span disciplines, the sports teams
    etc. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s Diebold: <a href="http://www.diebold.com/idmanual/" target="_blank">http://www.diebold.com/idmanual/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a concise one from Wiley Canaada: <a href="http://www.wileycanada.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-3511.html"

    <BR>Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>Jon'
