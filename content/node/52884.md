  x-height of the minuscules. I can\u2019t think of an explanation that applies across
  all the eras and designs where this is the case, and books aren\u2019t turning anything
  up. Why are the figures a little taller than the letters?"

  body: "It's not just OSF. Surely it's small caps too. Usually the same height as
    OSF?\r\n\r\nIt's going to be 'because it looks right' but still not sure why.
    I would love someone who knows to tell me.\r\n\r\nOne occasionally finds a font
    with the same height for lower case as OSF and SC. Can't think of an example."

  body: "1. Because figures are narrow. Only a, r, s and t are narrow letters (not
    including 1, i, and l), and m and w are very wide. Therefore figures need to be
    scaled up a bit, or else overall they seem too condensed in comparison.\r\n2.
    It helps differentiate between o, and slightly higher, wider, zero. \r\n3. Also,
    more figures have descenders than ascenders, and the top of 4 is weak, therefor
    their overall centre (vertically) is a bit low, compared to the minuscule letters,
    where there are more ascenders than descenders.\r\n4. As Nick says, to align with
    small caps, which are taller than x-height, for similar reasons."
