  body: "Interesting, however these are Not Typefaces but interactive typographic
    algorithms.\r\n\r\nSmart fonts can indeed respond to text, but primarily as letter
    form content, not lexical meaning.\r\n\r\nTypography that responds to the reader
    is another matter.\r\n\r\nSome type designers have used OpenType substitution
    code to implement such effects, most notably Amy Papaelias: http://www.typetalkfonts.com/typetalk_demo.html\r\n\r\nJust
    and Erik described <em>Twin</em> in 2002:\r\n\u201CTwin is not really a typeface,
    but more an application that runs on the web.\u201D\r\nhttp://letterror.com/portfolio/twin/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
