  to throw a bit of a curveball really, it's a logo I'm working on  for part of my
  own business; related to design and print. I don't want to say too much as i'd like
  some feedback, first impressions, initial thoughts. It's essentially a sketch so
  any comments on design and polishing up would be great, though I'm just looking
  for feedback on what impression this letterform gives. It's the first time I've
  tackled any sort of weird script like this and, to be honest, I'm not sure wether
  to progress.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your thoughts!\r\nJ\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trial_3682.png]"

    a Greek restaurant in it too. \r\n\r\nBut it certainly a very unique logo. Not
    bad or good, just odd. Virtually no strong associations ... which is actually
    good, because you can bind it to any association you want with a simple tagline."

  body: "The dark patches make it a bit special. But that means the \"t\", \"e\" and
    two \"el\"s need that too.\r\n\r\nOne legibility problem: that last \"a\" is quite
    likely to be read as an \"s\" (even with the first obviously-an-\"a\" instance).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Cheers Hrant. Didn't think about the \"a\" problem. Colour needs sorting
    out yes. I might play and re post it.\r\n\r\nAwkward terminals make the x-height
    nearly impossible to define too, as you'll probably notice. Hmm.."

  body: "Note that since it's a logo, a letter doesn't always have to look the same;
    the second \"a\" can be different than the first \u2013 although in that case
    I would make the two \"s\"s a bit different as well. Just make sure such variance
    makes sense for the subject.\r\n\r\nBTW, the x-height is generally over-rated.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, I initially had the last A going right down on the down stroke, as
    far as a descender almost, with the horizontal/ strike through more a aggregated
    too. Might go back to it. I had also drawn the second S larger but the whole thing
    was just messy that way.\r\n\r\nI can see myself going almost full circle to the
    original drawing here!"

  body: "I first read \"Kisstells\". It took a bit to realize the last letter is an
    /a, and it took far longer for me to realize that in that case the second letter
    is also an /a.\r\n\r\nI quite like the style, but I think you're thinking too
    much of typefaces. I agree with Hrant the x-height might not be so important here.
    I like the /k. I think I would look at this logo like a handmade script and bring
    more variety to the letter shapes and flow.\r\n\r\nAs for associations, I find
    it difficult to say anything about this, but if I have to I would say it reminds
    me of stitch work which tries to become a graphic element or typeface.  I'm aware
    they're not mutually exclusive, but then associations aren't always rational.
    Either way, I think you have a good starting point here but you probably shouldn't
    be too conscious of the rules of typography. During the design process I wouldn't
    think of this logo too much as a typeface because that might be limiting in its
    forms."
