  on the FontForge website). I'm running Mac OS 10.6.4 on a MacBook Pro Intel Core
  2 Duo.\r\n\r\nFontForge seems to be VERY unstable... not the way I remember it.
  Whenever I press the Delete key, it quits. And the same thing happens with the Shift
  key and any Arrow key. I haven't tried any more keys but I assume that others will
  cause it to quit as well.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this problem or know of how
  to fix it? \r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nCale"

  body: It is unfortunate that George has declined to update the pre-compiled builds
    of FontForge for almost a year now, but I understand how difficult it is to maintain.
    It doesn't help that each version of MacOS X makes such significant changes to
    X11 and Python. That being said, I have yet to figure out how to properly compile
    the program from source. There have been many feature enhancements since the last
    build, and I haven't been able to take advantage of them.

  body: 'I don''t know about macs, but on Linux once having initial build environment
    set up (which comes down to <code>apt-get install build-essential</code> and <code>apt-get
    build-dep fontforge</code> for Debian/Ubuntu), building and installing it from
    source is straight forward. I always build from CVS myself and don''t wait for
    releases, which means early exposure to bugs but that is fine for me. '

  body: "I stumbled to this thread while googling. I'm using Linux Mint 9 XFCE & I'm
    having trouble with the program FontForge. It also keeps crashing when I press
    Shift among others as what was mentioned from CaleD. \r\n\r\nI tried doing what
    you said Khaled Hosny - I tried apt-get install build-essential and it was was
    okay - all updated and no changes made. But when I tried apt-get build-dep fontforge
    at terminal but it always gives me \"E: You must put some 'source' URIs in your
    sources.list\"\r\n\r\nAny suggestion what I should do? Khaled Hosny?"

  body: The instructions above for building FontForge from source, so it will not
    magically solve your issues. As for the <code>apt</code> error, it seems you don't
    have source repositories enabled (these repositories contains source code of the
    binary packages), you can enable them from the [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Ubuntu%20Software%20Tab|Software
    Sources]] tool.

    solve my issues that's why I'm finding alternatives. Already tried downloading
    and installing older versions of FontForge but always ended up having errors while
    building. I've spent almost 2 entire days trying to figure this out through endless
    google but I think with the current situation I'm in, it's now time to ask on
    forums since I'm going nowhere and kinda wasting time going in circles.\r\n\r\n>>>

    from the Software Sources tool.\r\n> The link you gave by the way is broken ^^;;
    In either case I've tried to enable it from the Software Sources tool but ended
    up having \"E: Unable to find a source package for fontforge\" error. Would it
    be alright to ask what is the url needed to be added in the \"other software\"
    page? I already googled but couldn't get good results.\r\n\r\nThank you."
