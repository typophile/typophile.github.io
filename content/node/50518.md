  body: Let us know where you're at and I'm sure our creative director will endeavour
    to get a chocolate cup cake to you. Also the best images will go into the film
    itself!

  body: "I'm in LA, but please feed the cupcake to\r\na deserving Brit instead. I'm
    sure you can\r\nfind one.  ;-)\r\n\r\nI'll send you the photo (you might need
    a higher-quality one, which we can talk about) and I'll try to get permission
    to pass along a jaw-dropping hi-res macro of an original punch (it's the \"G\")
    for your use as well. Also, I have [my own] decent macro shots of the Monotype
    and ATF cuts (text sizes). In case it matters, how are the rights to such submissions
    considered?\r\n\r\nBTW, this\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/73042013@N00/2895427251/in/pool-847442@N25\r\nof
    course is not a Baskerville; it's a De Vinne.\r\n\r\nOne other thing - the official
    logo of Canada is in a Fry's cut:\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Canada_wordmark.svg/250px-Canada_wordmark.svg.png\r\n\r\nWhich
    makes me add: you might want to distinguish between the two versions in your project
    (especially in the \"identification help\" part) since they're so different.\r\n\r\nOh,
    one last thing: would you like JB's family tree, going back about 5 generations?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
