  body: "Yes I think you can, or at least somehting like it. When you importing metrics
    you can select different choices on what to import and what to leave. Have a look
    there and se what fit your needs.\r\nYou'll find this in the metric window. \"Open
    Metrics\" command."

    have not stated what font editor you're using, so it's really hard to give specific
    advice. If you happen to use FontLab Studio 5, FontLab 4.x or TypeTool 3, the
    advice below should give you what you need. If you use Fontographer, DTL FontMaster,
    FontCreator, FontForge or one of many other font editors out there, you'll need
    to look for alternative advice. \r\n\r\nSo, assuming you use FontLab Studio, FontLab
    or TypeTool, and if you have some kerning in the font B, and you want to add the
    kerning from the font A to the font B but leave the existing kerning that was
    in the font B intact, you need to: \r\n\r\n1. Go to the Metrics Window of the
    font A. \r\n2. Choose Tools / Save Metrics and save the metrics as \"A.afm\" in
    a working location (e.g. the Desktop). \r\n3. Go to the Metrics Window of the
    font B. \r\n4. Choose Tools / Save Metrics and save the metrics as \"B.afm\" in
    the same location as above. \r\n\r\nAfter these steps, you have the full kerning
    data of both fonts saved in two AFM files. \r\n\r\n5. While still in the Metrics
    Window of the font B, choose Tools / Open Metrics, click on \"Continue\" and choose
    \"A.afm\". \r\n6. In the \"Import Metrics File\" dialog, set \"What do you want
    to do with metrics data\" to \"Do nothing\" and set \"What do you want to do with
    kerning data\" to \"Add imported kerning data to the current font\". Click on
    \"OK\". \r\n\r\nNote that after this step, the kerning pairs that existed in both
    A and B but had different values have been replaced with the values that came
    from A. So values from B have been only kept for pairs that did not exist at all
    in A.\r\n\r\nIf you want to retain the B values for the pairs that existed in
    all fonts, you need to complete the two final steps now: \r\n\r\n7. While still
    in the Metrics Window of the font B, choose Tools / Open Metrics, click on \"Continue\"
    and choose \"B.afm\". \r\n8. In the \"Import Metrics File\" dialog, set \"What
    do you want to do with metrics data\" to \"Do nothing\" and set \"What do you
    want to do with kerning data\" to \"Add imported kerning data to the current font\".
    Click on \"OK\".\r\n\r\nYou're done. \r\n\r\nAdam"
