body: "Hi typophiles! I am doing a massive history paper on typography during the
  19th century. There was a lot of innovation in the typographic in this period due
  to the new demand and ability of the industrial revolution, including the creation
  of the first slab serif and sans serif fonts.\r\nAnyway, I have mostly been using
  textbooks for my research, but I have been unable to find primary sources. The only
  \"primary sources\" I can find are books of fonts released by type foundries during
  the era. I am not finding anything that I can really quote and include in my essay
  like I typical would in a history report. I could really use some help with this
  primary source dilemma. Please let me know if you have any ideas of types of things
  that I could use as primary sources or if you know of anything in particular. (I
  did find this great website called typeheritage.com, but the website mysteriously
  went down last night and now I feel stranded without sources...)\r\nThank you!"

    a university library, go to the stacks, browse the shelves in the region of Z246
    to Z250. Use the catalogue.  Search names like Clouse, who wrote among other things,
    a history of the McKellar foundry and a book on artistic printing. Search Loy,
    who wrote biographies of the punch-cutters who cut the fonts, which are collected
    in a book. Search Nicolete Gray who wrote a significant book on 19th century ornamented
    typefaces.\r\nNot much in the way of \"primary\" sources from the 19th century.
    Type-making was a craft for artisans rather than an interest of the chattering
    class. But many interesting fonts were patented. The patents are online via Google
    and the U.S. Patent Office. \r\nDon"

  body: "Good point Nick. \r\nMichael , for negative views on 19th century type design
    read almost anything by Theodore Low De Vinne http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Low_De_Vinne
    and Linn Boyd Benton http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn_Boyd_Benton Linn Boyd Benton
    invented many of the most important type founding technologies of the late 19th
    century. Don't confuse him with his son, Morris Fuller Benton who was very influential
    \ in the eradication of 19th century typefaces. \r\nAn essential aspect of your
    paper should be an understanding of the philosophical differences between 19th
    and 20th century typefaces.  Contrast and compare the tremendous range of 19th
    century typefaces -- which range from exuberant and ornate to wispy and aesthetic
    -- to post 19th century industrial machine age standardization [Benton etc.].
    \ Unless you are writing a book, you should probably do best to avoid being sidetracked
    into long discussion of other post 19th century design movements such as neo-Gothic,
    Art Nouveau etc. Stick to how type was designed and made in the 19th century and
    provide some perspective on how it differs from later. Focus=success.\r\nOK enough
    free tutorial. You have plenty from Nick and myself to write a good paper.\r\nDon"
