  of and I can't figure out what it is. \r\n\r\nThe ascenders are slanted at the top;
  the capital E's middle arm is shorter than the top and bottom; and the lowercase
  \"e\"'s terminal ends short.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any help!"

  body: 'I hate to say this, but that''s not Interstate.  Look at the cap S: the terminals
    are horizontal, where in Interstate they''re diagonal.  Likewise, the lowercase
    e shows a lot of variation between thick and thin, while Interstate is quite monoline.  And
    the junctures leave the stems at an angle, while in Interstate they curve smoothly
    out from the stem.  I don''t recognize this myself, and wonder if it''s deliberately
    crude hand lettering based on Interstate (and on the US Dept. of Transportation
    highway signage fonts which inspired Interstate).'
