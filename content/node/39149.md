  body: "What I'm trying to do is since the font uses the same glyphs for both upper
    and lowercase is to have any kerning that is done to all characters at the same
    time, all of these below included in one class\r\n\r\n_A: A' Aacute Acircumflex
    Adieresis Agrave Aring Atilde\r\n\r\n_a: a' agrave aacute acircumflex atilde adieresis
    aring\r\n\r\nCan I combine the two and have it work so I dont have to seperately
    kern upper and lowercase since they are the same glyphs basically it is an uppercase
    only font."

  body: "Yes, you can combine them. The FontLab metrics window gives you the options
    of (flat) pairs kerning, class kerning, and class kerning with exceptions. You
    probably don't have one of the \"class\" options selected. There is a PDF manual
    that comes with the program. Read the kerning section.\r\n"

  body: "I've sent a ticket into fontlab, I've tried everything, with class options
    selected, read the manual numerous times no matter what I cant get the most simplest
    classes to work and react in the preview window, my kerning actions only affect
    the main glyph and when I click the icon the submenu is greyed out when it should
    show the class and glyph associations\u2026"

  body: "To tell you a little secret, I too have trouble with FontLab. How I work
    is to write my features, then \"save\" them from the OT panel.\r\n\r\n<em>(Edit:
    actually, to be truthful, I don't even \"write\" the features in Fontlab, but
    with a text editor that allows a column mode. But the easiest way, the first time,
    is to write them in FontLab.)</em>\r\n \r\nI then open up that file with a text
    editor -- I use VEDIT, but EditPad Pro is likely a better, more modern choice.
    At the head of the features file, I write my classes, such as:\r\n\r\n@_exclam=[exclam
    \  bracketright c d e g i j k l p r s t v w x y question quoteright quotedblright
    uni02BE uni02BF];\r\n@_zerosuperior=[zerosuperior   onesuperior twosuperior threesuperior
    foursuperior fivesuperior sixsuperior sevensuperior eightsuperior ninesuperior];\r\n\r\nthen,
    make a kern feature, e.g.,\r\n\r\nfeature kern {\r\n\r\nand add the positioning
    commands, e.g.\r\n\r\n   pos @_exclam @_zerosuperior 50;\r\n   pos @_comma @_zerosuperior
    -50;\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSome creativity with this technique is possible; you can
    do you kerning as pairs in FontLab, build a kern featrure in FontLab, export it,
    then (as above) define your classes in the feature file (NOT the classes file,
    that should have nothing in it with my technique), change your existing entries
    in the kern feature in accordance with the classes you write, and re-import the
    modified (new) features file.\r\n\r\ni.e. in the file, you change\r\n\r\n   pos
    A C -36; \r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n   pos @_A2 @_C1 -36;\r\n\r\nand since you have now
    written classes for @_A2 and @_C1, it should compile just fine.\r\n\r\nJust remember
    that when FontLab alerts you that the kerning values are different from the kern
    values in the features, and asks if it should rebuild the kern feature, you say
    NO. Not only NO but HELL NO.\r\n\r\nThis is a tough way to go, but I've found
    it bullet proof when, as always happens, I have to go back into the font and change/add
    kerning. I save the .VFB, and try to never work from the .OTF. In point of fact,
    I keep the separate (importable) features file current as well.\r\n\r\nJust remember
    that the kerning in the compiled feature file is what is used when you generate
    a font.\r\n\r\nGood luck"
