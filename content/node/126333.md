body: "Hi everyone!\r\nI have a somewhat unusual request on behalf of a friend. \r\nThere
  is a court case where one side claims that a document was printed year 2005 and
  the other side claims that it was year 2016. \r\nThe font used is Times New Roman,
  I think. \r\nIs it possible to look at the font used and determine if this particular
  version of Times New Roman was / was not available in year 2005? I assume that most
  fonts are updated continuously behind the scenes, minor tweaks and such.\r\nSee
  attached image, a higher-res version with more text is available as well.\r\nWould
  be really grateful for any help you can provide."
