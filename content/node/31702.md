body: "(audio from pulp fiction, NOT SAFE FOR WORK)\r\n\r\nQuote by Motionographer:\r\n<cite>SCAD
  student Jarratt Moody is in Time-based Typography I here at SCAD (a course for which
  I\u2019m currently the teaching assistant), and he recently finished up a really
  nice piece for the first project in the class. The basic idea of the project is
  to take a piece of audio from wherever (movie, song, poetry reading, answering machine)
  and then represent that audio on screen using only typography.\r\n\r\nJarratt chose
  a famous bit of dialogue from Pulp Fiction as his subject matter. (Okay, what dialogue
  from Pulp Fiction isn\u2019t famous?) The resulting piece is full of whimsy and
  style. Jarratt does some great things with scale and simple but effective camera
  movements. Get those headphones on and prepare yourself for several lashings of
  Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s naughty tongue.</cite>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.motionographermedia.com/jarrattmoody/intonation.mov"

    to do a piece of Pulp Fiction as well (a different piece, but ok.), becuase I
    practically always use Pulp Fiction quotes in my type specimen. I'm somewhat of
    a Pulp Fiction-freak. ;)\r\nI got the assignment this morning, speaking of coincidence...\r\n\r\nIt's
    looking really good, and I doubt I would have done better.\r\n\r\nI guess I will
    use a piece from another masterpiece movie, then. :)"

    see it being a problem as you were going to use another piece of dialogue anyway
    \u2013 and as we all know, there are plenty to choose from. Just do it differently."
