  body: They sure went to a lot of trouble to reverse-engineer that just to make a
    font but they probably saved a big bundle, too. We had a single glyph digitized
    (typesetting company logo) which appeared in the headers on all our Lino 202 galleys.
    Mergenthaler charged us several thousand dollars -- for just that single glyph!
    We were a large company though so the cost wasn't as important as the company
    image was, and we paid it.

    did it start becoming commonly used?
