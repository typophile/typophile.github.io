  books ?\r\n\r\nI'm talking about book design (layout) and not about font design.
  I have tons of exemples of good books design but not technical books. ANd i'm not
  talking about graphic design books, but in technical books in general (science,
  architecture\u2026).\r\n\r\nWould like to check some, but 99% are crap !"
