    great site, I saw that blog a while back. Kinda inspired me to post this thread.
    Curious to see what other serif fonts are out there."

    FontShop periodically offers a freebie, but i don't think they're license-free.
    I don't think Lido is license-free either, if you're going to be using it commercially."

    to the labor involved in creating such a work, I think you'd be hard-pressed to
    find any complete serif families beyond that list."

  body: "Almost none of these fonts are \"license-free\" - they have a license, even
    if there is no charge for the font.\r\n\r\nIf you do find \"license-free fonts\"
    you are unlikely to find a usable serif family of decent quality. Even in the
    broader category of no-charge fonts, you'd be hard-put to find a really high quality
    serif family, with the entire family available, that would be great for general
    text usage.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
