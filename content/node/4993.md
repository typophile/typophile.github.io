    by by Jock Kinneir,  <a href="http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr17/pdf/f21_pos.pdf" target="_blank">
    see the last page here.</a> There&#39;s also a possible link <a href="http://www.signdesignsociety.co.uk/SDS%20Directions.xls"
    target="_blank">here</a>, scroll down to row 26. <BR> <BR>I seem to recall a wall
    in one of the rooms at my art college being covered in brand use guideline posters,
    because one of the tutors had been involved in the design. Unfortunately I had
    approximately zero interest in corporate design or typography ##years ago. <BR>

  body: It isn&#39;t quite the same, though. Look at the cap M and the lower case
    R. Helvetica is probably closer.

  body: alex&#39;s link shows a version sold by urw&#43;&#43; of transport,kinnear&#39;s
    font for the british road system. although it shares some similaries with continental
    sans of the 50s, it does it&#39;s own thing &#40;check the l,t,R etc&#41;; it&#39;s
    not just a redrawing of Akzidenz Grotesk or Helvetica. so its not a sub for BR
    &#40;not sure if that&#39;s what you meant&#41;. <BR> <BR>if you want something
    that&#39;s close to the BR font, start with Akzidenz Grotesk or Helvetica. <BR>
