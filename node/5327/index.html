<div class=commentbody>If you're talking about the OpenType version, as far as I know, you can't utilize the swashes, etc. unless you have a program that can read its' Unicode encoding. Quark won't.

Since it takes them at least 4 years to make a revision, it is unlikely that they will be in business long enough to discover Unicode. So to quote assorted Valley Girls, "As IF!!!" <br>:-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thomas: so now that i've opened my big mouth, i'm wondering if i don't just have a corrupt file or somesuch... <br> <br>i purchased bickham as a download from veer.com and, on my creaky old mac with shamefully old software (we're talking pre system 8.5, G3 upgrade card, Illustrator 8...), i get the "can't print... missing outline file/ATM not turned on" error when trying to use swash caps - even though i seem to have all appropriate files and ATM is turned on. plus, i can "create outlines" in Illustrator. i don't have this problem with any other fonts, but given the vintage of my system, i figured tech support would tell me i'm SOL. <br> <br>i did have a friend test it on her whizzy G4 a while back, and from what she said, it sounded like she saw a problem as well. though, in rereading her description ("disappearing text"), i'm wondering if she just didn't type in any actual caps. doh! <br> <br>in any case, if you have any suggestions (other than buy a new computer), i'd love to hear 'em! like i said, converting to outline works, but it would be nice to not have to do so. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>hrm... Chris' set up is similar to mine. i use suitcase as well (probably terribly old version, but i also think i tested bickham by putting straight into the fonts folder); however, i'm on an older version of the OS (8.1, anybody? *cringe*). but if bickham is circa 1997, it should work, yes? it's just odd because i'm limping along fine with all my other fonts. my vote is for corruption of some sort...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chey: It could indeed be font corruption. That was always a problem, particularly on that era of OSes. If you can't find your original disks to reinstall from, you could either call customer service or nab something from a colleague (with the understanding that you are already licensed for this software). <br> <br>If you want to run the same font in OS X with native apps, you don't need ATM. Just be sure you have 10.2 or higher, and read the notes on MMs and OS X which can be found here: <br> <br>&lt;<a href=http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?13 target=_blank>http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?13</a>@<a href=mailto:29.sxt4cq59l8t.0@.ef6eec0>29.sxt4cq59l8t.0@.ef6eec0</a>/78> <br> <br>(if the link doesn't work by clicking, try cutting and pasting the entire thing) <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chey -- <br> <br>I have an old Mac that I still use periodically -- a first-generation G3 tower running OS 8.1 with 256 Mb RAM -- and Bickham Script MM works just fine. I use ATM Deluxe to manage my fonts. I don't happen to use (or have) Illustrator, so I can't verify that it works there. But it works fine in Quark 4.1, FreeHand 5.0, and FreeHand 8. <br> <br>Is it just the swash caps that give you trouble?

Just to be on the up-and-up, though, I would want to see some proof of your Veer license/purchase. Contact me off-forum, if you want to pursue this. <br> <br>But if the fonts are showing up properly on screen and the problem is just in printing, then I wonder if the culprit might not be a bad (or old) printer driver.
