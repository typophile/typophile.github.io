  making the type dance or look like it was dancing, moving... <BR> <BR>Anyone got
  any good suggestions for Dancing fonts, or idea&#39;s about applying dancing type?

    photograph the lot.

  body: Another take might be to think of the ribbons that some dancers have used
    to accentuate their movement. And not only for fluidity, but also for quick movement
    and prancing.

  body: You could start with the premise that the logo will be multimedia, rather
    than static. So the print version would just be an instance. After all, the logo
    will have a lifespan of at least ten years....and with digital paint being cheaper
    in the future than &#34;hard&#34; printed images that need frequent replacement,
    all surfaces will have the potential to be animated. So an animated logo now would
    be ahead of its time. <BR> <BR>You could also have a flexible system, rather than
    just one design -- as with the original FontFont logo &#40;which seems to have
    petrified these days&#41;. <BR> <BR>An animated GIF could be used for the logo
    online, although the animation would have to be subtle, of course. Like Mr Coles
    applauder. <BR> <BR>Hmmm, maybe I could do that on my site...

    <BR>I always thought this would be ideal for a &#34;smooth movement&#34; use.

    would no doubt convey movement. <BR> <BR>You could develop it as a motion project
