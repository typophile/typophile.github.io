    has made some stamp fonts. <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAFO-CHAT\">Charter
    Stamp Two</a> is probably as close a match as you'll get with a digital font.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I actually digitized a rubber stamp face many years ago. Miraculously, the
    internet archive kept the web site to see a sample (although the actual font files
    aren't there):\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fridays_6599.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    that's close, let me know. I'll fire up the old G3 and see if I can find the font
    on there. \r\n\r\n(On closer look, it appears to be the exact same set of stamps...though
    my shoddy and sloppy digitization probably doesn't due justice to the source). "
