  body: "Nice \"friendly\" banter between you and [[John D. Berry]] at the beginning
    there. Yikes.\r\n\r\nThat aside, I really admire your dedication to improving
    the Toronto Transit signage. I wish someone had the gumption to do that here in
    <a href=\"http://typographica.org/001032.php\">San Francisco</a>.\r\n\r\nThese
    videos are excellent. Don't think I've seen conference talks presented so well
    on the web. My compliments to Mr. Bazargan."

  body: "The problem with John was that I prepped him beforehand on what he should
    say, which he then ignored. I mean, God love \u2019im and all.\r\n\r\nI was, in
    fact, perfectly nice to him while it happened.\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"
