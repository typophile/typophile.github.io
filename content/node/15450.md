body: "Hi everyone! Since there were great responses from the last topic I made, I've
  decided to make another! \r\n\r\nFor my assignment, I have to create an A2 size
  broad sheet (Kinda like a poster). I've done alot of experimental things to the
  body of text that's about 5000 words i.e. cut them out, overlapped etc. I've broken
  alot of the rules!! \r\n\r\nBasically, how I've arranged and designed the text looks
  dynamic and eye catching, but illegible at the same time. I just want to know what's
  essential to make something legible to read i.e. a good kerning size, leading etc,
  while still keeping the same shape/look. Readability is crucial to this sheet, so
  any information such as how text should be arranged or what typeface is too small
  for reading would be extremely useful.  \r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone can recommend a
  futuristic looking, technical typeface for the heading would be great! The topic
  for the broad sheet is about pre-terrorism (like pre-crime from the movie Minority
  Report). \r\n\r\nThanks for your time! I hope to hear alot of great responses again!!
  =) \r\n\r\nVincent.    "

  body: If you can get a copy of it either in the Library or purchase it, there is
    a new book out about the old publication U&LC. They were always pushing the bounds
    of creative use of type with legibility. It might help. I don't remember the name
    but a Google search for U&LC should turn it up.

  body: "The intended use of the broadsheet will impinge on the can of worms that
    is legibility and readability (even if there was a consensus on what improves/reduces
    either). Questions of your audience for example, what age are they, how do you
    perceive them reading it (ie is it at arms length, stuck on a wall, will they
    read it in one \"sitting\" or will they return to the subject etc, etc). Once
    you have a clear concept of that, and remembering that your views will not chime
    with every member of the audience so you will need to consider extremes also,
    you could show it to unbiased readers. It sounds to me that you are trying to
    create something that introduces conflicts to the detriment of the content.\r\nTim"
