  so, please tell.\r\n\r\nI'm not after authentic or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/viger-spa/|authentically-inspired]]
  stuff; more of a shortcut to making a design that includes stuff like the picture

    like that would likely bring in a haul.

  body: The design makes me think more of alchemical symbols than runes - even "magical
    symbol" type runes tend to look a lot like the real ones.

  body: IIRC, there are a few, too, on the [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/typoasis1.htm|typOasis]],
    including MKlein's free warez. Some of the stuff there is right odd, even by my

    don\u2019t know of a culture you don\u2019t estimate, rotate them about 90 or
    180 degrees and go on \u2026"

title: Runes. Not real ones. Just some kind of "magical glyphs" set.
