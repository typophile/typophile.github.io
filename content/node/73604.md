body: "I am making a design proposal for a contemporary art institution, and need
  to mock-up a range of posters, leaflets, catalogues etc.\r\n\r\nI have settled on
  Museo Slab for headings. However, I would be grateful for recommendations for a
  font for the body text. The font needs to come in two versions (EG slab & sans;
  or serif & sans), as I need to set body text in parallel languages (Danish and English),
  and I would like to differentiate the languages with different variants from the
  same font family.\r\n\r\nThe body text font should obviously work with Museo, and
  should have an up-to-date feel. The two variants should have a similar colour on
  the page when side by side, and ideally they should be good for immersive reading
  too. My current favourite is Freight, using serif and sans versions... But I am
  also thinking that a font with slab and sans variants might work better with Museo.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

    Seria</a> (which might be problematic wrt the Italic). And Rotis, of course.\r\nI
    can't comment much on the Museo match, except this: You kind of have it backwards;
    especially when your text setting is sort of complex, you should let that lead
    the design; i.e. settle on the text font[s] before the headline fonts. Because
    there aren't going to be thousands of families that work for your setting, and
    you're additionally narrowing the field by first defining a headline face they
    need to go with. & consider also that for example if you end up settling on a
    family with 3 variants, such as FF Nexus, you might want to use its own slab (for
    example) for the headings, and maybe the other 2 variants for the text, for a
    super match."

  body: "Nina, I take your point about going about things from the wrong end. In fact,
    I have tried to approach it from the body text end, and have looked at a lot.
    I love Majoor's fonts, especially Scala and Nexus, but the former is over-used
    in the artworld, and the latter is a little too retro for this job. \r\n\r\nI
    am glad you pointed me towards Quadraat - I think that's a very good suggestion.
    As a sans & serif combination it works better for this purpose than Freight. And
    I like its humanist qualities. (Not quite present enough in Centro, unfortunately,
    which I find a touch cold for this job)."
