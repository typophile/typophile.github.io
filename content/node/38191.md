  Kunz and images of some of his work? I have a report to do for a class, and so far,
  browsing the web has been hit or miss. I already have a copy of Macro and Microaesthetics
  from the school library and am currently waiting for the copy of his other book
  to come in. However this doesnt give me a good sampling of his work and style. So
  if anyone knows of a good source of info that'd be great. Please and thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Ashlie\r\nAshliefleig@gmail.com"

    get a lot of good information. Google may be evil, but it\u2019s not bad. ;\xB0)"
