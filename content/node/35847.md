  in Redmond at Microsoft. Thanks Simon!\r\n\r\nNow I am in BC to visit the man who
  made the actual metal type that P22's gave out at this year's Typecon. Jim Rimmer!\r\n\r\nAh...
  Type bliss.\r\n\r\nI think I will start posting images from Typecon tomorrow night. "

    public. Hence my thanks to Simon. And I don't know how public the content of the
    presentation was meant to be. \r\n\r\nHowever the photos from it will be going
    up on Flicker eventually as Simon requested. \r\n\r\nI have put up a bunch already
    but I am only partway through day 2..."
