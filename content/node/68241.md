  of any others, that would be good information as well.\r\n\r\nIf any of you work
  for them, if you could email me a PDF of your latest annual report I can reference
  you in my thesis.\r\n\r\nThank you very much."

    count, but also Adobe and Microsoft ship a lot of fonts. I would imagine some
    of the East Asian font vendors are publicly traded too, maybe Modular Infotech
    in India.    '

  body: ">Nokia makes the most cameras.\r\n\r\nFor sure. But isn't there a saying
    that the best camera is the one you have with you? That Canon 40D with the $5,000
    lens is nice, but if you left it at home the day the aliens land, your iPhone
    camera will work out fine. Same goes for fonts.   \r\n"
