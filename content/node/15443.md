body: "In the design of the (Latin) UC there are two general schemes: the \"classical\"
  (old-style) one where the widths diverge a lot (like \"B\" is narrow while \"C\"
  is wide); and the \"modern\" style where the widths converge a lot. When it comes
  to numerals, it just hit me that even in the old-style scheme there's a lot of convergence
  in width (except for the one). Now, it can be said that numbers are inherently \"rationalist\"
  so they should converge. But there's always the option of making monowidth numerals,
  and when it comes the old-style (AKA \"text\") numerals it seems to makes sense
  that their geometric divergence shouldn't be confined to the vertical.\r\n\r\nThis
  idea came to me upon returning to admire Perrin's Augustaux:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Elzevir/PerrinNums.gif
  _\r\n(See this old thread: http://typophile.com/node/7596)\r\n\r\nThe main question
  -assuming you agree that width divergence has a place- I think is this: what might
  be a good scheme here? I mean, which numerals should be towards the narrow end and
  which the wide? And does this relate to the given numeral being x-height, ascending
  or descending? Also, can we greatly diverge the widths even in the design of lining
  numerals?\r\n\r\nIt's not impossible that we might end up with a new numeral scheme
  that works better in running text... at which point we might start calling what
  we currently call \"old-style\"... \"transitional\"?  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I like the horizontals of 2, 7 and 4 to be relatively long, and I think the commonest
    fault is to make 3 and 5 too wide. Especially 3, which often seems to end up much
    too large. I like the way that in the older typefaces the lower curve on 3 and
    5 is distinctly not the same shape as the circular curves on 8, 0, 6 and 9, and
    the horizontal of the 5 distinctly not the same length as the horizontals on 2,
    4 and 7.\r\n\r\nPersonally also I like the completely unmodulated 0: the pure
    circle. I know people find this \"stands out\", and want to give it some modulation.
    But it seems to me to be perfectly functional and to have a certain satisfactory
    symbolic quality."

    either with each-other or with text.\r\nI tend to agree with Paul on the proportional
    categories but wonder if this is just a matter of visual adjustment to make them
    all feel like a set.  Figures like 8 have a lot going on so they can look like
    a dark spot in a line of text.  That is why they should be widened, not just to
    fit some classification scheme.  Three should be narrower because it is not closed.
    The difference in horizontals of 5 and seven is a question of how much is going
    on in the rest of the figure.  You wouldn't want a wide horizontal on the 5 to
    make it topple as top heavy where as the 7 needs something to hold that very long
    diagonal.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Chris bring up some good points about width issues. I love \"old-style\" numerals
    and actually have been tossing around the idea of including them with the typeface
    I'm working on now. After some thought I asked myself (and now I ask of all of
    you): aside from style or look alone, what purpose do \"old-style\" numerals actually
    serve?\r\n\r\nFunctionally speaking I can't justify using them in heavy text settings
    and where issues of width proportion are a big concern. I like the way they look
    though. :)"

  body: "\"...what purpose do \u201Cold-style\u201D numerals actually serve?\"\r\n\r\nTerry,\r\nEach
    style of figures has a purpose. Monospaced are needed for tabular uses; proportional
    lining are good in text where you want numbers to be prominent (phone directories,
    business cards, etc.). So called \"oldstyle\" is best for running text where you
    don't want figures to pop and become obtrusive. What you have to think about when
    designing a typeface is what your users/customers will require and see as a plus
    in their purchase decision making. Even if you feel comfortable not using oldstyle
    in your work, your users probably will.  Remember, people who actually BUY type
    are more likely to use it at its fullest and want their options open.  This assumes
    you are talking about a text face.  It is less true for display and not needed
    for signage.\r\n\r\nBTW, How is life (and work) in San Francisco?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    \"slightly\".* Just make it an ascending numeral (hopefully still shorter than
    cap height though).\r\n\r\n* Unless we really want to get medieval on our asses
    and apply that idea to the entire alphabetics - which might indeed rule. The Greeks
    used to do it, until Porson threw Modernism at them.\r\n\r\n> as monospace as
    possible\r\n\r\nThere's little point to this. Tabular use (Dan's point) needs
    all the nums to be the exactly same width. If you give that up (basically for
    the same reason that letters aren't all the same width) there's no point <cite>approaching</cite>
    it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    century) French style, which De Vinne once called \"a novelty that failed to catch
    on\". As far as I'm concerned it's worth reviving (or at least thinking about,
    which too few designers do, even accomplished ones) actually because they fit
    better with the Cartesian usage of the lowercase; in the conventional alignment
    scheme you're more likely to end up with a numeral string that seems to sit too
    low.\r\n\r\n> differentiation might be improved if the 3 and 5 were not so similar

    descending might be ideal.\r\n\r\n> someone put a couple of 1\u2019s back in the
    wrong case\r\n\r\nGood eyes! What's interesting though is that the tabulation
    was maintained aligned. Maybe all (or a bunch) of the IN's fonts had all their
    numerals of the exact same width - smart, since wrong-sort situations (more probable
    with numerals than alphabetics) wouldn't throw a wrench into composition.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
