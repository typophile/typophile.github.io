  would like to anyone can help me to identify the name of the typeface of the numbers
  of this imagine, it\xB4s from an exhibition of an artist called Florian Pumhosl.\r\n\r\nI
  think number 7 it\xB4s not the same typeface from the other two numbers: 6 and 8,
  or maybe none of them are from the same typeface. Or maybe it\xB4s designed specially
  for the artist.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\nSaludos!"

    8 seems to match well, and the 6 would need her drop/curl (sorry I don't have
    the term for it) added, which if you look closely on your sample, seems to be
    the case. it appears slightly \"broken\" there for lack of a better word. not
    certain about the 7 and its origin."

      defiantone,\r\n\r\nyou\xB4re right, the 8 match well whit \" eunoia\".\r\nthe
      6 look a bit diferent, the x-heigth it\xB4s taller on \"eunoia\" \r\nand it\xB4s
      possible the 6 have been modified adding the terminal on superior part of the
      number like you say, i found an example of this solution on \" compass stencil
      alternate\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipografiaramis/compass-trf-stencil/\r\n\r\nthat
      in the regular version \" compass alternate\" don\xB4t have this terminal on
      6.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipografiaramis/compass-trf/\r\n\r\nanyway,
      the transitions between the thin lines and fat lines of the number (sorry I
      don't have the term for it) are more thin on the image i uploaded.\r\n\r\nNothing
      i can found about the 7.\r\n\r\nHope anyone can help or talk us something about
      the origin or inspiration of this, or \"eunoia\" or \"compass\" letter style.\r\n\r\nSaludos!"
