body: "Okay, I'm a really new user of Fontlab, and I have an extremely frustrating
  problem.  My boss has given me the company's old Garamond font which, right now,
  is broken up into about four sub catagories.  That is, when you go into InDesign
  CS2 the font pulldown menu shows Garamond as all over the place.  All together there
  are 31 styles and about 3 catagories for them all to go into.  So, I singled out
  all the fonts, put them into Fontlab where I can now save them as vfb's or otf's
  but I can't generate a suitcase that will allow for so many different styles within
  one Family.  I'm sorry if I'm confusing anyone, this is really hard to explain.\r\nI've
  tried changing the FOND IDs and made sure the Family Name, the Font Name,  and the
  Full Names were all written the way they should be according to Adam Twardoch's
  posts and Leslie Cabarga's book.  Every time I wind up with the same message...\r\n\r\n\"Styles
  in FOND named \"Garamond Book\" cannot be merged.\r\nYou have used duplicate styles.\r\nCannot
  Proceed.  Please fix the conflict.\"\r\n\r\nBut that's not true, I went through
  every single font info box and made them all unique to the font, regardless of file
  type.  There's no way the fonts have identical styles, they're all named differently.
  \ Especially in the FOND ID line.  Am I just way off track and there's no way to
  stick so many fonts into a single family?  Have I been pulling my hair out for no
  reason.  It seems like a perfectly normal application for the program.  Right?  Thing
  is, the end result has to be an Open Type font.  Mac Type 1 will work, but what
  I really need is an Open Type.  "

    because that sounds like a lot of styles for one design.\r\n\r\nI think OTF's
    are standalone, and you can't put them in suitcases. Either/or. \r\n\r\nOpenType
    would offer you the ability to reduce the number of styles, maybe substantially.
    Have you considered combining Small Caps and OSF fonts with the Regular one? "

    tried breaking these into smaller catagories, but I still get the same problem
    when the families are over the four different kinds of styles.  Even when I make
    sure each one is unique and written the correct way the stupid generator tells
    me I have identical styles.  Thanks for your help.  You really want the birthday

  body: "Ah, I see. \r\n\r\nThese Garamonds are from different families, even though
    they are all named Garamond. Have you seen samples or specimens of these? \r\n\r\nI
    wonder what the final result is suposed to be: will you distribute the fonts to
    your organization, or keep them for your use, or...? I ask because you might not
    need to go through all these steps if your goal is simply to use them on your
    own machine. Also, re-combining them may be unnecessary....\r\n\r\nIt looks from
    the font names like you are trying to combine 3 or 4 different families of Garamonds.
    ITC Garamond, which it looks like you have, is very different from Adobe Garamond
    and that is noticeably different from Garamond Three, which you also have. So
    you may want to seek out the original install discs of these fonts to see where
    they came from and how they were grouped originally. That may explain why they
    appeared in the font menu in more than one place, and why you received them in
    sub categories. They are different.\r\n\r\nI've attached a gif showing a variety
    of the available Garamonds (just the romans, regular or book weight). You can
    see that some of them would not work very well together (visually) if you had
    them all in the same suitcase. Since you have been assigned to be the font guy
    there, you may want to become familiar with these. Be advised, however, that this
    is the tiny tip of a gigantic iceberg; if you don't want a new obsession to take
    over your other work, you might have to tell your boss to find another font guy
    or gal. Figuring out the different Garamonds is a good first task to attempt;
    if you don't have the patience or interest for it then you may not be a type nerd
    like me. \r\n\r\nIn your list there are some small cap and Oldstyle figure fonts
    (end with OSF or SC). They are separate fonts from the Regular ones. In PostScript
    we always had to choose between small caps and lowercase because you could only
    ever have 256 characters in a font. You can use them together, but you have to
    mix them in your document, like epoxy. OpenType is a new format that allows much
    larger character sets, which means the small caps, oldstyle figures, alternates,
    ligatures, etc. that are part of a single style (Roman, for example) can all go
    in one file. That would clean up your font list a lot. However you cannot group
    all the characters from the Bold Condensed in the main Bold OpenType font. Each
    style has its own font. And of course you would not put the characters from ITC
    Garamond in a file with the Adobe Garamond. You would have a revolt on your hands!
    ;)\r\n\r\nThere are some books you might like to have to help with this: \r\n\r\nHow
    To Boss Your Fonts Around,  by Robin Williams, \r\nAnatomy of a Typeface, by Alexander
    Lawson,\r\nThinking With Type, A critical Guide... By Ellen Lupton\r\nThe Elements
    of Typographic Style, by Robert Bringhurst\r\n\r\nThere are others, maybe some
    other typophiles will recommend. There are other books listed in the typowiki
    as well. \r\n\r\nNow, I haven't really solved the problem you wrote about. I didn't
    ask which version of FontLab, or platform, but I think I should suggest you check
    the FontLab site for support info (there's a forum to visit), since the problem
    you're having could be a bug. The newer version of FL (5.02) seems to be more
    stable than the previous one. I realize the FontInfo window in FL is a hornet's
    nest, and managing a lot of styles from FL is likely to make anyone cry, So don't
    get too burned up. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to employ a font management program,
    and there's a great new free one out from Linotype: FontExplorer X. I am not sure,
    and others can chime in here, but I think it might have the ability to organize
    and re-unite font families. That could solve the problem for the whole office,
    without cost. Just an idea. \r\n\r\nBirthday cards sound nice, but I'd rather
    that you have a good experience with your fonts and keep your boss happy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/garamonde_4108.gif]"

  body: "Awesome, thank you so much.  I was starting to suspect that I'd have to totally
    submerse myself in this font stuff to ever get a real grasp on it.  It looks like
    my worst fears have been realized.  It's time I become a type-nerd.  \r\nNow,
    I'm working on Fontlab 5.0.2, and I understand you can make a single opentype
    font that is many characters deep.  However, I don't see how you make them.  Is
    that what glyph generating does?  And once you do generate some glyphs, i.e. \"A.smcp;B.smcp;C.smcp...\"
    how do you toggle between those when you're in another program like InDesign?
    \ \r\nMaybe I should tackle a smaller font family first, like the Garamond Books.
    \ If I have each style in Fontlab 5 and they're all seperated and I have them
    saved as vfb's or seperate otf's or whatever I need to save them as, how do I
    get them to combine into one file that can be dropped into Extensis Suitcase and
    turned on so that all programs can use it?  Does that make sense?  It does to
    me, but I'm not sure I'm sane anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was also starting to see
    that book and regular Garamonds wouldn't work together, so thank you Miguel.  You've
    saved me another entire eight hour shift of complete frustration.\r\nTell me,
    do you guys dream about font vectors?  Because I do.  And it sucks.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for everyone's help.  And I really am having fun."

  body: The use of these fonts will be for distribution among the company.  I think
    some of the design and layout people were tired of having to completely switch
    fonts instead of being able to pull down a list of only Garamonds.  So, yeah,
    to answer the initial question, not for personal use.

    frying my brain just thinking about starting over and making three key fonts now
    for the ITC, 3 and normal versions of Garamond just so I can reproduce all the
    styles for each one.  So, tell me, how does one buy an open-type font?  And how

  body: A ha, new question.  so, I'm starting from scratch, running through each fonts
    information, and I come to the copyright info which, for Garamond 3 regular, is
    reading "Adobe Systems Incorporated" and I'm thinking that this may have a huge
    role in my problem.  If I'm working with Adobe fonts and trying to get them to
    work with fonts copyrighted by someone else on the ITC Garamond end, will that
    hinder my ability to get them all harmonized?

    really doesn't know. It isn't worth your or your boss' time ( = Money ) for you
    to try to make OpenType fonts from what you have. \r\n\r\n1. It's MUCH harder
    than you are prepared for - weeks and weeks of tedious work you've never done
    before\r\n\r\n2. The typefaces you are starting with aren't that versatile or
    useful anyway (ITC Garamond is only useful for a very dated kind of display work,
    no text)\r\n\r\n3. The problem is easily solved by licensing well-made OpenType
    fonts for your whole company. OpenType fonts are cross-platform and can be installed
    on Macs or PCs. Same file goes to anyone. Professionally-made OpenType fonts will
    have appropriate kerning, encodings, character sets, and functional OpenType features
    which are useful to you when using InDesign or Illustrator. Worth the money.\r\n\r\nConsider
    conferring with the design people in the company and see if there's any consensus
    on what typefaces they would want. Choose one serif and one sans family, license
    them, distribute them and declare them corporate typefaces. Delete the others
    and join the 21st century. Then you can get back to your regular work. \r\n\r\nVersatile,
    workhorse OpenType Pro serif types: \r\n\r\nBembo Book Pro\r\nAdobe Garamond Pro\r\nAdobe
