  I found this two  examples from  beginning of 2oth century (Austro-Hungarian Empire).
  I wonder if these are custom made? Or does any one know for simmilar typeface from
  that period? \r\nAll thoughts are welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_6406.jpg]"

    Vuitton Replica Handbags</a> reviews lately and I wanna thank you for that. Besides
    the advices and recommendations, these reviews are very helpful, especially for
    those of you unfamiliar with replicas. Here is the second men\u2019s review I
    received so far. "

    image called probel c. It was designed by http://www.letterhead.ru/Fonts/index.html.
    However as you will see, its no longer listed among their fonts, but if it's close
    enough, you may be able to email them. \r\n\r\nThis is the bio from myfonts, so
    one of the other designers may have created the font and left the company. I wasn't
    able to even get a google link to the font. http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/LHS-IG/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/probel
