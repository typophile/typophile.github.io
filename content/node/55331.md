  body: "Don't neglect their close relative \"c\". The bottom half of the \"c\" is
    usually echoed in the \"e\" but can be considerably different from the same curve
    segment of \"o\".\r\n\r\nFrom there you need to decide how you want to close the
    bowl, and there are lots of ways to do that. Could you post an image of what you
    have so far?"

    already work this way, is starting out with your glyph as a single contour, to
    better control the inside curve until you get things where you want them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lc_e_5289.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLater,
    remove overlaps and adjust to taste."

    - The terminal of the 'c' is different to the 'e' as in Futura, I only had the
    'o' to go on.\r\nkentlew - Thanks, that's valuable advice. Also useful for construction
    of italics it seems so I hear.\r\nterminaldesign/altaira - I am going to post
    for advice on every letter, I just started at 'e' to throw you off! (o/j)\r\n"

  body: Actually, working with serifs come much more natural to me than sans serifs.
    There's more of a natural flow, not like the constructed measure of a sans.

    might be a <em>little</ em> more forgiving than sans, especially sans with extremely
    low modulation.

  body: "I don't think there is one letter or glyphs harder to draw than an other
    one. To my point of view the hardest thing is to determine the way I will draw
    the stem (H, l), the bowl or curve (Oo) and the serif if it's a serif one. Once
    those things are set up, the rest will be easier to do. One thing I found, may
    other one has probably found out also, is to work with no extrema point for the
    curve when I draw the basic design. Once you've found the right design than you
    place those extrema point. That way to me works pretty well.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9 :^)"
