  font.\r\n\r\nThe font name's GRASSO and it is a stylish, big, glam, only-uppercase,
  font for headers, magazines and posters....\r\n\r\nI developed the entire alphabet
  and 3 number but now i would like to collaborate with someone else to create a better
  font. \r\n\r\nWhen the font will be complete I will release it under opensource
  license.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in typography, collaboration, sharing ideas and opensource
  write me an email to tonio[at]webelieveindesign.com and I could send the vector
  file to work on.\r\n(send me some example of your  work)\r\n\r\nhere some example
  of the font I'm talking about...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/492743679_3d36782a8a_3837.jpg]\r\nthe
