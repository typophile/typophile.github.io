  understand the &#39;three strikes&#39; comment either. <BR>seems brash.. <BR>i understand
  all of the ethical reasoning. <BR> <BR>i simply asked if anyone knows of a good
  resource for finding a typeface much like &#39;luther&#39; that may not be forty
  dollars. <BR> <BR>no harm is/was meant.  <BR> <BR>

  body: Michael, don&#39;t worry it was all in good humour, hence  <BR>the smiley
    next to my &#34;three strikes&#34; comment. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s just that we have
    very strict rules about exchanging  <BR>pirate copies of fonts over this board.
    The information  <BR>Luisa gave you enabled you to search on the internet  <BR>for
    the actual font file and swipe it. I agree it does seem  <BR>brash, but we draw
    a very clear line here. Whatever  <BR>happens outside of Typophile doesn&#39;t
    concern us, but  <BR>here it&#39;s a definite no go. <BR> <BR>If deleting Luisa&#39;s
    post is considered an error of judgement  <BR>then I take full responsibility.
    I&#39;m only human. <BR>Sorry to have startled you. No harm is/was meant neither.
