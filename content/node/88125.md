body: 'Hay there I was wondering what the difference between a midpoint and a bullet
  is. I believe that midpoints get used in units of measurement and bullets are used
  to introduce items in lists. Other then that Im really not sure how to differentiate
  them and what their proper uses are. '

    the midpoint may be used in Catalan in fonts that don\u2019t have a special l-dot
    character.\r\nWould that be termed an accent or a punctuation mark?"

  body: "What units of measurement use midpoints?\r\n\r\nMidpoints are a sort of all-purpose
    punctuation mark, useful for separating items on the same line and for a variety
    of other uses in display contexts. They can also be used as a multiplication symbol
    (though that is probably a different Unicode character). They are not often used
    in running text.\r\n\r\nBullets, of course, are used in bulleted lists.\r\n\r\n"

  body: According to the 'Pedia, the middot can indeed serve as a multiplication sign
    when the dot is preferred. The 'real' one, though is &times; (&amp;times; or &amp;#215;).

  body: As to how to differentiate them, the middle dot is expected to be similar
    in size and shape to the period, whereas the bullet is larger such that its darkness
    stands out from text.

  body: "For vector and matrix arithmetic, cross multiplication (denoted with \xD7)
    is a different operation from dot multiplication (denoted with the \u22C5 operator),
    and the middle dot \xB7 makes an adequate substitute for the dot multiplication
    sign in a font that doesn't support a large range of math symbols. And although
    probably rather rare, I expect there are sometimes occasions when vector arithmetic
    would need to be mentioned in a non-math typeface."

  body: A proper bullet should not have (much of) left sidebearing. Hardly see that.
