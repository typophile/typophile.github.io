    looking typeface onto someone&#39;s body? There are plenty of better looking alternatives!
    <BR> <BR>Hypothetical question to the board: Suppose you were forced to get a
    typeface tattooed, which one would you choose?'

  body: Chris, I&#39;m sorry, but I really don&#39;t know what this typeface is. As
    for Brian&#39;s ink, you could google for it.

    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>IDing these obscure selfmade type fonts isn&#39;t
    easy because there&#39;s so many of them on the web.. Which means we basically
    have to go dig through humongous piles of crap and waste, hoping to come upon
    a <i>particular instance</i> of crappiness. Not fun. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
    border=0> <BR> <BR>But who knows, there&#39;s still a chance someone else might
    recognize it. Viel Gl&uuml;ck!

  body: Chris I know you want this exact typeface, I&#39;m not questioning that, but
    what about Zebrawood Fill? It is pretty close. :^/ Sorry I am out of ideas. Good
    Luck!

  body: Hey guys and gals, <BR> <BR>I sent Chris to you when I couldn&#39;t answer
    his question. I just got back home and found an e-mail from him saying that my
    idea to ask the site owner might be risky for him, because this comes from the
    Hell&#39;s Angels Motorcycle Club web site! <BR> <BR>As far as I know the Hell&#39;s
    Angels logo font is a custom design that they don&#39;t want being used by anyone
    else, so if that&#39;s true, that helps explain why none of us know this font.

  body: If you are referring to the Ortiz-Lopez font, you can&#39;t get it. <BR>It&#39;s
    listed under his proprietary fonts, which means he <BR>made it for the Red Sox
    and nobody else can have it. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll have to settle for one of the
    lesser, freebie fonts at <BR>Patricia&#39;s link.

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I still think that the original sample Chris posted is a freebie
    that&#39;s out there <i>somewhere</i>. The Ortiz-Lopez font is considerably better
    built than the sample. Or, as Mike suggested, it might just be a custom design.  <BR>
    <BR><i>Edit: From what I could dig up, Mike seems to be right -- it&#39;s the
    Hells Angels font and it&#39;s trademarked.</i> <BR> <BR><i>Edit 2: See</i> <a

  body: Not only is the Lopez-Ortiz font &#39;better built&#39; it doesn&#39;t look
    the same, since Chris wants the identical font. It is only similar &#40;just as
    some of the other suggestions have been&#41;. <BR> <BR>It has occurred to me that
    you could make something more like the Hell&#39;s Angels font, using Zebrawood
    Fill, or one of the other close suggestions, and duplicating the closer-looking
    serifs and using them to replace the other serifs. But it requires special graphics
    tools, and would be a lot of work. <BR> <BR>Chris, you originally asked if I knew
    someone who could draw it, so apparently you don&#39;t have the tools or skill
    to duplicate this look yourself, is that so? <BR> <BR>I REALLY think you should
    just use Zebrawood Fill, or Saloon Girl, or Saloon, and give up trying to match
    this any closer.
