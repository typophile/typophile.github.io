  body: "I was just going to ask the same question.  Windows XP version, plese!\r\n\r\nIt's
    pretty funny how they got the size of the program down to 4.9 MB from 180 MB.
    \ That's some nice optimizing, unless I'm missing something."

  body: anti - It's nothing like previous versions of FontExplorer. Besides being
    a font manager, all previews of fonts are accessed from a remote server rather
    than the app itself. See <a href="http://typographi.com/001028.php">Typographica
    </a>for more.

  body: Nice, I like this application. The menu is great, and the preview...very useful.
    I don't think I'll be using Font Book anymore.

  body: Hrant, I suspect that a Windows version is in the works. I shouldn't say anything
    more specific at the moment, but I'm sure that more detail will come out in ATypI-talk
    and reports.
