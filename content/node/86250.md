body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nFor a project I've been studying all the tabloid magazines and newspapers
  (US Weekly, People magazine, In Touch, National Enquirer etc.) and it seems like
  the magazines that are the most tabloid (hard gossip, politics etc.) are using something
  along the lines of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica-inserat/|Helvetica
  Inserat]]. \r\n\r\nsee: http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gawker/2008/09/nationalenquirersarahpalinstorycoverawardsmarkpasetskydavidperel.jpg\r\n\r\nAt
  the same time all the more fashion and celebrity-minded magazines are using the
  pointy fonts like [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009|Verlag]],
  [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2|Neutraface]] or [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Relay|Relay]].
  Sometimes Futura condensed as well. \r\n\r\nSee http://www.google.com/search?q=gossip+magazines&client=safari&rls=en&oe=UTF-8&um=1&hl=da&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&oq=gossip+magazines&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=5682l5682l0l5878l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0\r\n\r\nCan
  someone think of fonts that are in between these? Or something that can be both
  when used in different weights or in condensed etc. Masculine enough to convey the
  'big shocking sensation YOU HAVE TO READ' but a bit more feminine and fashion-minded
  (like Verlag etc). It needs to have some condensed cuts as well and it would be
  nice with something that isn't as overused as the above mentioned (verlag etc.)
  and with a larger x-height.\r\n\r\nThank in advance."

    of it, and it's surprisingly delicate and playful at the lighter, wider weights.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. \r\n\r\nI really like Graphik, but it lacks a
    condensed variation for this purpose. Roxy seems a bit too old school for me.
    I've been thinking about Antenna, Flama Semi Condensed and Galaxie Polaris regula
    and condensed, but they're lacking the more fashion-like aspect I would prefer
    too.\r\n\r\ndezcom, by 'pointy' I was referring to the sharp ends in the uppercase
    A, M, N, V etc. in Verlag and Neutraface. (not counting verlag condensed and compressed
    that are less pointy) What the best term for this, if not pointy? I'll check out
    your photo set.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey again. Thanks for some more good suggestions. \r\n\r\nI really like Brandon
    Grotesque, but I'm not sure it would cut if for the very condensed style in most
    tabloids. Rather than Trade Gothic I've experimented a bit with Benton Sans (it
    also has both condensed and extra condensed/compressed), but I feel like it's
    been used a bit too much. The same thing goes for Gotham although the condensed
    and narrow ultra weight works great.  Amplitude has a great range of styles, but
    too me it seems a bit dated, since it was used so much around 5 years ago.\r\n\r\nHas
    anyone seen [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/prelo-condensed|Prelo condensed]]
    in good use? Although it might be too masculine for the fashion/red carpet stories.

    choices."
