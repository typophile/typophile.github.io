  Hours in german) which shows stores from certain categories and whether they're
  open or not. The design idea was to have a vintage feel of a small grocery store.
  Here's how our main screen currently looks like:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/26422/permanent/typophiles/bello.png\"/>\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking to replace Bello as font with something that has slightly more modern feel
  to it and is also more readable, which I could use better in marketing materials
  and upcoming android version. I tried with Pauline, but I'm having second thoughts.
  What do you think?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/26422/permanent/typophiles/pauline.png\"/>"
