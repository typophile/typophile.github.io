body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a question about the legal issues of typefaces. I understand
  that each type foundry may have different guidelines but I thought I'd ask here
  as well since everyone here is so knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nI am looking to purchase
  a typeface and then go into the typeface files and edit some of the letters as is
  needed. Would this be a violation of rights or illegal in anyway? It is obviously
  discouraged but will I run into any copyright issues if I use it for business purposes?
  I'm thinking \"no\" but I'd like to know just in case.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: This can only by answered by reading the license agreement. MANY (probably
    most) foundries don't allow this, but there are notable exceptions,  including
    Shinn Type and Adobe.

    Chart</a> that probably still allows you to cross out many foundries that did
    not allow modifications even for in house use. You look at the \"Mods.\" column.
    Once only a handful are left, you check the EULA.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://canadatype.net/eula\">Canada
    Type EULA</a> also allows modifications."

    even more lenient than that chart says: mods are not limited to format conversions.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
