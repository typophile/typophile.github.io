body: Does anyone have any stories of font abuse where someone has been prosecuted?
  For instance, a design house using a font and not buying the license etc.. Has anyone
  had experience with this? <BR> <BR>I never really hear of anything like it in type,
  it sometimes seems like people can get away with it.. &#40;or can they?&#41; <BR>
  <BR>I found <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fct/2001/2001fct1170.html" target="_blank">this</a>
  in the archives.

  body: The emigre story in the LA Times Magazine last year  <BR>quoted Rudy saying
    that they &#40;emigre&#41; had never lost a case. <BR> <BR>Who knows exactly what
    kind of breadth he was describing <BR>and what he meant exactly by <i>case</i>.

  body: On the othe hand, during ATypI-Rome RvL told me that the Apostrophe case was
    a very rare instance &#40;quite possibly the <i>only</i> instance&#41; that Emigre
    has gone to court &#40;although they were also involved in the SSI thing as well&#41;.
    And since the Apostrophe case ended with a whimper, it might very well be that
    Emigre has also never <i>won</i> a court case! On the other hand, they have used
    the <i>threat</i> of lawsuits to some effect. Although that has also turned off
    some otherwise benevolent font people. On the other hand, I think it&#39;s fair
    to say that Emigre &#40;and others&#41; have now grown out of that &#34;obsessive&#34;
    phase, and hopefully will now start producing more mature <i>fonts</i> as well.
    <BR> <BR>Besides Apostrophe and SSI, I remember a big case with Linotype in Europe,
    but I don&#39;t know much about that one. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I&#39;m not aware of any cases of illicit font use that have gone to court.
    Generally speaking, if caught using an unlicensed font, a company will promptly
    pay the appropriate license fee, since this is very much cheaper than contesting
    the charge. Also, companies often cannot account for all the fonts on individual
    computers or networks, so they may not realise that the font they are using has
    not been correctly licensed. Companies, especially big ones with a large installation
    base, are beginning to realise that having unlicensed fonts exposes them legally.
    Recently, Agfa Monotype introduced a <a href="http://www.fontwise.com/">font licensing
    management tool</a> that helps companies keep track of their font licenses. It
    presupposes that most companies want to do the right thing and just need help
    doing it.

  body: Yes, Linotype did win in a number of cases. Some in the US, a few in the UK
    and far more in Germany. Recently the MediaMarkt case. In their press release
    archive at <a href="http://www.linotype.com" target="_blank">www.linotype.com</a>
    you can find a few.
