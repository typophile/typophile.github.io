  body: "look at the /W of <strong>[[http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Stephanie-Marie-JBT0000067#|Stephanie
    Marie JF]]</strong> by Jason Walcott\r\nit's exactly the same except of the right
    part of the letter.\r\nIs there an alternate? Is it just modified? I don't know...\r\nThe
    truth is, it looks very similar to be a coincidence."
