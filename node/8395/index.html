  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Please give me some criticism here! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m graduating an undergrad design program this year and we &#40;the senior design students&#41; are putting on a senior portfolio show.  The concept involves how writing about design issues &#40;in books like Looking Closer, and sites like Design Observer&#41; are finally affecting the academic student level.  We want to celebrate what these writers have done in helping us think about design in a more socially conscious way, a more intelligent way.  We are having Richard Buchanan &#40;editor of Design Issues Journal, MIT Press&#41; come to speak. <BR> <BR>So, since I sort of put together and presented this concept to the other students, they put me in charge of the identity for the show.  This is going to need to be a mark adaptable to posters, fliers, web, banners, and a book cover for a book we are producing to sell at the show. <BR> <BR>We are calling the show &#34;Critical&#34;, because these things discussed by design writers are all critical issues...but we couldn&#39;t focus it down to one critical idea.  So to comprimise we decided to try to make a logo that encompasses a broad scope of what design writing discusses. <BR> <BR>Anyway...here are some directions...I&#39;ll quit talking. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56814.gif" alt="This is the most recent idea. More &#39;all encompasing&#39;"> <BR> <BR>Above: My most recent idea.  More &#39;all encompassing&#39;.  It is very large, and I&#39;m not sure what might be a good way to deal with that, but on smaller media we could just hint at portions of it, and finally on the book use the whole thing. I think i like how that effect might work. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56815.gif" alt="Something like this would allow us to highlight certain &#39;critical&#39; aspects depending on where they&#39;re used.  We might do &#39;Critical: Influence&#39; on the speaker&#39;s podium&#44; and &#39;Critical: Writing&#39; on the book.  I dont&#39; think its all that attractive though."> <BR> <BR>Something like this would allow us to highlight certain &#39;critical&#39; aspects depending on where they&#39;re used.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, I&#39;m glad you picked up on a wheel or rotation on the second one...that was the plan. <BR> <BR>I tried putting some sort of dial or hand &#40;like on a compass or clock&#41; on the first to point to and highlight different ideas, and it actually looked pretty good.  I just thought it looked too much like a clock or compass, and led the concept astray a bit. <BR> <BR>Any ideas on making the first one a little more adaptable?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">JT: <BR> <BR>The first design is a nice concept for a book cover, or other applications that would permit such a large image. Maybe you could create a horizontal oblong oval shape to replace the circular shape. The oval could hug the &#34;Critical&#34; type a little more, overcoming many of the spacial issues. On large applications you could include the surrounding words and on small applications you could remove them. That&#39;s just one idea. I think there are a myriad of different ways  you could morph the background for different applications, such as leaving it as is, but cropping it around the &#34;Critical&#34; word, creating a rectangle or some other shape. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the first, even though the second is definitely safer and probably easier to work with. The second one feels like solutions I&#39;ve seen before &#40;and not just Office:mac&#41;. The critical circle doesn&#39;t need to be the logo. It could be a central image that is echoed either partially or completely in other pieces. The cocentric circles will fall apart at small sizes and on screen, but you probably don&#39;t need so many, or so many every time. The logo/small print version could be &#39;Critical&#39; in a solid red dot &#40;perhaps with small radiating rules&#41;. <BR> <BR>I have a tendency towards difficult logos, so keep that in mind. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I went to CMU when Dick Buchanan was the head of the design school. He&#39;s a very interesting speaker. <i>Very</i> concept/thinking oriented. Can I ask where he&#39;ll be speaking?</div>
