body: Hello. First off, this board has been very helpful! <BR> <BR>Can anyone identify
  the fonts below?  <BR> <BR>1. I want to know what font &#34;Screaming For Change&#34;
  is written in. <BR> <BR>2. What font is &#34;Wishingwell&#34; and &#34;Records&#34;
  written in? <BR> <BR>3. What font is &#34;Side Two&#34; written in? <BR> <BR>These
  look like very basic fonts so hopefully it will be a no-brainer for someone. I&#39;m
  guessing the fonts are the same but just at different weights. <BR> <BR>Thanks again,
  <BR>Sean O&#39;Donnell<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37841.jpg"

  body: Well, it&#39;s from 1966 &#40;if the date on the label is correct&#41; and
    it is slightly different from the digital version of Helvetica we have now &#40;the
    S is a bit narrow and the C and G are a bit wide&#41;. It could be that it&#39;s
    a knock-off version, but basically, yes, it&#39;s Helvetica.

  body: Heh, I thought there was something very-not-1966 about it. I saw the date
    at the bottom and it looked like a 6, not an 8. I actually wondered if it was
    a fake. <BR> <BR>I still stand by my ID. Given that it was 1986, if it&#39;s actually
    a Helvetica knock-off, I think it could be Compugraphic&#39;s Helios which would
    still have been common then.
