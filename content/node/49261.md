  body: Don't know the font (I somehow always assumed it was Gotham, but never checked
    for sure), but the band is playing in a pouring rain not far from my home now.
    They're pretty noisy, REM should be even noisier later on.

  body: It is close to Gotham but the S is very wrong for it to be Gotham

    S seems very narrow compared to the other letters."

  body: I think this might be Gotham mixed with the skinnier S from Whitney. I tried
    it out on the H&FJ typetester and it looks pretty similar.

  body: "I think the idea that the S is from a different font seems to explain why
    its width doesn't fit the other letters very well (in my opinion). However, I
    think the S from Century Gothic has too small a lower bowl/counter. I would pick
    the type that it was based on -- [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/futura/|Futura]].\r\n\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Asvetic, No one said it was neutraface. people said it may have been neutraface2,
    Which is almost exactly correct except for the S.\r\n\r\nI'm with mike in thinking
    that the S is from a different font.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the album art I posted,
    the A is not the same as the A in Neutraface2.\r\n\r\nwhich means the A may be
    from another font"
