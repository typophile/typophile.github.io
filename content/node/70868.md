    might help.\r\n\r\nThe descender on /W/ may actually be more helpful on /U/ to
    distinguish it from /V/ ... have you tried that?\r\n\r\nThe top right of /Z/ is
    rounder than necessary. Tried copying the top of the shape from, say, /E/?\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, I love the concept. Could you draw out something like a 3D wireframe
    on which it's based? (like <a href=\"http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/amman/_content/noon/poster/Noon-Pot.png\">this</a>
    from <a href=\"http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/amman/\">here</a>)\r\n\r\nMay I
    be excited for l/c, too?"

  body: "@skosch: Thanks for feedback! I will definitely apply your advice on the
    u/v problem. The Z has the same curve as E, S or any other letter since the elements
    are copied.\r\nAs for the wireframe I didn't draw any. I based it on metrics and
    serifs:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cath_5704.png]\r\n\r\nLower right
    descending corner of a stem is always horned, lower left is always cut. Obtuse
    angles of strokes are rounded (bottom part always, upper one only if it's an element
    such as in S or Z). Hope I explained it clearly enough.\r\nAs I said, it's gonna
    be free - so whatever you want to use it for, either personal or commercial project,
    you can without informing anyone or paying anything. You can use it for whatever
    you want for free as long as you don't claim to be the author or sell the font
    or modify and redistribute it without my consent.\r\nI will finish Cathedrale
    this week I think (all capitalics, some diacritics and basic punctuation) and
    include the license in the package."

    you reuse the N by flipping it upside down. You're D and O might have some problem
    I can tell them apart becuase of the counter, When you change the point size it
    might not be as noticeable. Also some people have trouble telling certain letters
    apart. I was thinking maybe you could change the N to be a capital N."
