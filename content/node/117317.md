    their version likely went through the old phototype unitizing process. Linotype

  body: Yes indeed, interpretation is the name of the game when making digital fonts
    from metal-era designs such as Palatino. The issue arises because the letter shape
    on the face of the type changes when it is printed. And the printed shape varies
    depending on the printer, the paper stock and the condition of the type, among
    other things. So to which shape should the redesigner/digitizer be faithful?

    Linotype has much more typographic features like old style figures and small caps,
    whereas the other one has none of these but wider language support.

    font in precomposed form -- nor, likely, any Palatino you can find. You're in
    romanized Indic script country.\r\n\r\nHowever, you're in partial luck. The Palatino
    I'm referring to does have U+0323 (dotbelowcomb) as a combining accent, and it
    seems to have mark positioning. The font does <strong>not</strong> have U+0307,
    the combining dot accent. It does have U+02D9, the spacing modifier dot accent.
    Of course, there is no mark positioning with spacing modifiers, it isn't their
    purpose. Still, if the occurrence is infrequent, you could kern it back & rekern
    to properly space the following letter. The Unicode in the file will be a trifle
    compromised. Or, you could use a proper combining dot accent (U+0307) from, say,
    Charis or Gentium -- funny thing about those periods, they look a lot alike. Just
    get the size & spacing close in the application program.\r\n\r\nThe license for

    any dot accent from any Palatino would look the same, if you can find one with
    the combining accents to preserve syntactic meaning. Sadly, most fonts don't have
    any. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an Adobe font does allow modification, if purchased
    before 2011, even if for one of the Monotype conglomerate companies' fonts (of
    which Linotype is now one). Otherwise, no time constraint.\r\n\r\nTell your program
    to default to *that* Palatino font for the one character. \r\n\r\nAin't EULAs

    is another (though you're suppose to tell him), some of the fonts marketed by
    Village, etc.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is automatic (in the EULA), sometimes you have
    to ask. The ones that turn you down are more often, but not always, involved in
    the advertising side of type use.\r\n\r\nI've researched this some, though I have
    not gathered hard data. What fits the questions posed & answers I've gotten is
    the \"no modifications\" clauses began as an effort to limit/stop piracy. The
    small foundry (publisher) tells the lawyer what they are trying to stop, he/she
    words it a certain way. When that is all the publisher is after, they will usually
    allow modification, as long as it is well done and does not affect their product
    negatively.\r\n\r\nHowever, some publishers look at modifications as an extra
    revenue opportunity. This would include FontFont and the Monotype conglomeration.
    Even so, they are quite different companies. FontFont at least, is quite generous
    with both their backup and embedding policies. The new Monotype is not; I find
    them similar to some of the more aggressive pharmaceutical companies. You know
    the line about drug prices -- due to \"research costs\" -- esp. researching what
    gets you higher sales with your print & TV advertisements...\r\n\r\nThere is a
    funny story about FontFont, maybe even true. They had screwed up the encoding
    on a font, and a somewhat miffed customer finally agreed to pay to have it straightened
    out. Only at that point did FontFont asked \"well, what's wrong?\" That's asking
    a bit much of your customer, what? (Believe this was posted on Typophile many
    years ago.) But \"modifications\" aside, their EULA is still one of the better
    ones for many type users.\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Nick is right with asking: \"So to which shape should the redesigner/digitizer

    adopted for photo typesetting, the typeface was considerably modified.  While
    hot metal Palatino comes in distinct, specially designed versions for each size,
    photo Palatino comes only in one design, which is used for all sizes.  Additionally,
    some of Palatino's personality was ironed out; it seems Linotype wanted the new
    phototype Palatino to be more neutral and less lively.\r\n\r\nThe digital versions
    of Palatino available today from Linotype and Adobe are based on the phototype
    variant.  Berthold has prepared a digital version based on the old hot metal typeface,
    but it is no longer available, as Berthold ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nHere you can

  body: "\"Palatino was originally a hot metal typeface.\"\r\n\r\nNope, Hermann Zapf
    originally designed Palatino for the Stempel typefoundry as a handsetting typeface.
    An that\u2019s just \u2018metal\u2019 ;\u2013) \u2018Hot\u2019 metal refers to
    the line casters by Linotype and Intertype as well as to the Monotype machines.
    These machines produce set type by producing it directly from matrices in the
    desired type size. With hand setting, metal type is pre-produced and definitely
    \u2018cold\u2019 when the type setter picks them from the type case. The first
    Linotype-version of Palatino was called Aldus, a slightly modified version of
    Palatino, taking the technical restrictions of the Linotype line casting machine
    in account. Main problem to be tackled: duplex matrices which caused the regular,
    the italic and the bold weight to be designed at the same widths. https://www.flickr.com/photos/pietschreuders/8389641634/\r\n\r\nThe
    Berthold version as mentioned above, is based on the metal / hand setting version
    by Stempel, not on some \u2018hot\u2019 metal / line caster version."

  body: "A follow-up on the Palatino conversation. I really like the Berthold digitization
    that Michael pointed out above, and I could extract some almost usable font files
    from the PDF.\r\n\r\nI've contacted [[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/|Berthold]]
    and they said that \"Palatino BQ was discontinued in 1997.\" Bummer. I've then
    asked about the legalities of using versions of that font which float around in
    public (like in that PDF file), and about modifying these font files to fix and
    improve them. Sadly, there was no answer.\r\n\r\nTwo questions: One: is there
    a recent approximation for Berthold's Palatino available somewhere? And if not,
    then two: can I work with the font I extracted from the PDF?"

    article, \"The original Palatino,\" I do like its liveliness and warmth. It seems
    to have been captured best by http://www.bertholdtypes.com/ 's digitization (see
    http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/pala92.pdf which has the font embedded) but
    that digitization is no longer available. There is the http://www.linotype.com/57056/palatinolinotype-family.html
    version, and the http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/pagella version,
