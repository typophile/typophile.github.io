  but when i tried to submit it here to receive some advise, I saw about 35 very very
  similar fonts designed by others. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_5351.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  this the case ? I mean is every beginner designing the same font :) ? "

  body: Ruler & compass font ideas ran out in the mid 1970s. No matter what you do
    with a ball & stick, it can't help but resemble everyone else's ball & stick.
    That doesn't mean you can't make one too. Just make it better or different or
    more useful or hit a smaller niche.

  body: "i think its looking good so dont give up...\r\n\r\nThere are so many sans
    serif typefaces but even if its something that bares similarities to others the
    main thing i would look for is versatility which will make it more usable - the
    relationship between the weights, and also how does it work together at sizes
    like caption, body, leader, headline etc?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks for reply, I'm also trying another one, a serif font, can you guys
    tell me if it is worth continuing? or have you seen a similar font? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bb_4681.png]

  body: "If these are your first fonts, don\u2019t worry about being original, worry
    about getting them done. By the time you have these fonts working well and kerned
    you\u2019ll have realized that you need to get a lot more experience before releasing
    anything. I\u2019m about to release a font for the first time, and it\u2019s the
    third I\u2019ve done. My first and second fonts weren\u2019t remotely original
    and will probably never be released. But they were certainly worthwhile learning
    experiences. \r\n\r\nI do like where your serif design is going. You\u2019ve got
    some great ideas there\u2014run with the design while you use the geometric design
    to learn about spacing and kerning."

  body: "well for this one, the way you end your strokes is a little weird.. but if
    you're dead set on keeping that.. for the 'c' you should reverse the action of
    the stroke because it's supposed to look like the stroke of the pen and the way
    you have it now, one of the strokes is backwards.\r\n- Scott Sullivan\r\nwww.trifepdgm.com"

  body: "You are absolutely going into a right direction. Just don't care whether
    there are similar designs exists or not, don't even look for them. If it's 100%
    your work, it has to be unique. \r\n\r\nLooking at your work, am assuming that
    you are working on Illustrator at the moment. You should start learning FontLab
    from now onwards cause that will give you more command over the decisions you
    are making. And you will save a lot of your time too.\r\n\r\nAll the best."

  body: I have designed some Armenian fonts about 10 years ago using Fontogrpher,
    FontLab has changed a lot since :) so I'm having a little difficulties adjusting.
    I'll design the bold one and will post here to see what comes out of it.

  body: When I saw them second sample I thought the same thing as Satya. You really
    have to say goodbye to Illustrator at some point. If you have to choose only one
    format, go with OTF.
