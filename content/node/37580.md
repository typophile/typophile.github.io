  ID (CS1) you can go to windos/workspace and register the way you place all your
  panels. It creates a icon XML, and after that if you want to go work to a custumer,
  you took you XML icon and you put it in the library/preference/adobe/workspace and
  your workspace are going to be like when you work at home.\r\n\r\nNow it's possible
  to do that whit Illustrator, did someone know ?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nMarc C"
