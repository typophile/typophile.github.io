  body: "<em>Non commovebitur donec despiciat inimicos suos.</em>\r\n\r\nThis is from
    Psalm 111 (Catholic reckoning (Psalm 112 in Jewish reckoning): <em>Baetus vir,</em>
    Vugate text of the Breviarum Romanum). It is the end of verse 8:\r\n\r\n...confirmatum
    est cor eius: non commovebitur donec despiciat inimicos suos.\r\n\r\nMy monastic
    diurnal gives this translation of the Latin: '...his heart is strong, <strong>he
    does not fear, whilst he looketh down upon his enemies</strong>.'\r\n\r\nThe Jewish
    Publication Society <em>Tanakh</em> gives this translation of the Hebrew original:
    'His heart is resolute, he is unafraid; in the end he will see the fall of his
    foes'.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<em>Vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere.</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    is from Psalm 126 (Catholic reckoning (Psalm 127 in Jewish reckoning): <em>Nisi
    Dominus,</em> Vugate text of the Breviarum Romanum). It is the beginning of verse
    2:\r\n\r\nVanum est vobis ante lucem surgere: surgite postquam sederitis, qui
    manducatis panem doloris. Cum dederit dilectis suis somnum...\r\n\r\nMy monastic
    diurnal gives this translation of the Latin: '<strong>It is in vain that you rise
    early</strong>, and late retire to rest, ye who eat the bread of toil. For to
    His loves ones he giveth it in sleep.'\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Publication Society <em>Tanakh</em>
    gives this translation of the Hebrew original: 'In vain do you rise early and
    stay up late, you who toil for the bread you eat; He provides as much for His
    loved ones while they sleep'.\r\n\r\n"

    a Latin translation of that old adage:\r\n\r\n\"If it doesn't add, it subtracts.\"\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Michael, sorry I can't help you with that. My Latin is actually pretty limited.
    I don't know Latin, I just know psalms. :)\r\n\r\nI recognised 'non commovebitur
    donec despiciat inimicos suos' immediately, because it is from one of the psalms
    of Sunday Vespers (evening prayer) so I've chanted it often. It took me a little
    while to find 'vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere' though, because I don't regularly
    pray the office of None."

  body: Tim, your alternative translations make literal sense of the Latin fragments,
    but they don't fit the context from which the fragments were quoted by Warde and
    Gill (both Catholics, who would have been familiar with the Vulgate text of the
    psalms for much the same reason that I am).

  body: "Absolutely John, which is why I said that the Catholic translations were
    the most apt, I was thinking that looketh down, for example, might be misunderstood
    because it doesn't necessarily make a modern translation of despicare which should
    indicate contempt. The trouble is that translation is never an exact art, due
    to ambiguity and changes in the meanings of words, especially over three languages:)\r\nTim"
