  body: ITC Garamond Book, to be precise. And the W is definitely custom. There was

  body: "Well, the question was about the old Macworld logo font, but...\r\n\r\nApple
    originally just condensed ITC Garamond Light to 85%. Later on, a special version
    called ITC Garamond Narrow was created for Apple. It's been generally available
    since the early nineties."
