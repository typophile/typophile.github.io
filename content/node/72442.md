  \r\n\r\nI know how I'd do it without making a discretionary ligature for every number
  between 10 and \u221E, but has anyone else gone to the bother?\r\n\r\n\r\nR"

    I suppose, there is for roman numerals, 3,888,000, according to wiki).\r\n\r\nBut
    I haven't done it ... yet.  It's actually not a bad idea.  Of course, then you'd
    need to add the historic option for some of the optional forms and such.  Fractions
    would be a pain though."

  body: "<em>It's actually not a bad idea.</em>\r\n\r\nI think it's a bad idea. Using
    GSUB to switch between different numeral systems makes no more sense to me than
    using it to perform transliteration, e.g. switching between Latin letters and
    Cyrillic ones. It makes much more sense for numeral conversion to be performed
    at the character level by applications than at the glyph level by fonts. "

  body: "I thought about this feature (as a stylistic set) due to many people who
    don't handle or understand properly Roman numerals these days. But even if one
    does not know what LXVIII means, it may have to face this is some areas, especially
    Law, History and Philosophy.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'd prefer to use a GREP style in
    InDesign to manage this, user who has doubts about Roman numerals may not be able
    to adopt this solution. So, a stylistic set can be useful.\r\n\r\nInteresting
    to not that a designer claims to offer this as an \"exclusive feature\" in a [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/isaco/monarcha|font]]
    released much later than Operina and also after I published the OT code in the
    thread referred by sii."
