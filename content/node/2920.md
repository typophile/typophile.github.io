body: '[x-posted to FontLab group] <BR> <BR>I&#39;m new to all this, so any help is
  much appreciated. <BR> <BR>For non-Unicode applications, there is a common keyboard
  layout for polytonic Greek called GreekKeys &#40;Macintosh&#41;. It dates back to
  the mid-80s, along with fonts that have a non-standard encoding &#40;e. g., Athenian&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>I have Type 1 fonts from Agfa Monotype which I need to match to this layout
  and encoding, but I keep running into difficulties. <BR> <BR>1. I opened the GreekKeys
  font in FontLab 4.5 and saved the encoding. <BR> <BR>2. I then created a new document,
  put it in Names mode and selected the GreekKeys encoding. <BR> <BR>3. I then cut
  and pasted the glyphs from the Monotype font to match the GreekKeys font. <BR> <BR>4.
  In the FontInfo, under Encodings, I selected Western Latin 1 as the Microsoft Character
  set, but did not select any codepages as supported. &#40;I also copied all the hinting
  data from the Monotype font.&#41; <BR> <BR>5. I generated a MacIntosh suitcase,
  with the option to always use custom encoding. <BR> <BR>But the font that results
  is erratic, producing different results from the GreekKeys fonts, and different
  ones in different applications. <BR> <BR>The original GreekKeys font also has a
  number of problems on OS X: persistent difficulty over the glyph in &#34;currency&#34;
  slot, also one which is in the &#34;nbspace&#34; slot.  <BR> <BR>If I leave the
  glyphs there &#40;for legacy documents&#41; and put another copy of each into the
  one or two existing free slots, all sorts of weird behavior occurs in documents.
  <BR> <BR>It all seems so unpredictable. Can anyone help? <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>Victor'

  body: You are making a Type 1 font, yes? In FontInfo/Encodings try selecting &#39;Bitstream
    Font Set&#39; in the Microsoft Character Set. This is a strict cell-by-cell encoding
    of what you have in your FontLab font window in Names mode.

  body: Right, Type 1 -- I thought that way I could just keep Monotype&#39;s hinting
    and not worry about it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the tip. I&#39;ll definitely try
    that.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a little lost on what it actually means, though. What
    does the Character Set option do to the encoding? And how does one decide which
    set to select?

  body: The Character Set option determines how the first 256 characters in the font
    are interpreted, and whether they are re-ordered. If, for example, you select
    &#39;Western &#40;Latin 1&#41;...&#39; the characters will be re-ordered to match
    that character set. The Bitstream Font Set is a fixed encoding that is not re-ordered,
    hence its usefulness for making custom fonts. <BR> <BR>&#60;i&#62;And how does
    one decide which set to select?&#60;/i&#62; <BR> <BR>Years of painful experience.

  body: But why does the ordering matter?  <BR> <BR>I thought the point of the encoding
    table was to match a standard set of names with glyphs. Unless the ordering alters
    which name is paired with which glyph, how does it affect the application? <BR>
    <BR>I tried your advice, and using the Bitstream Character Set results in a font
    that works fine for applications that operate under Classic in OS X. But it still
    produces weird results in OS X proper &#40;in both Carbon and Cocoa apps&#41;.
    E. g., the same file comes up correct in Endnote 5, but not in Endnote 6. It&#39;s
    even worse in Mellel and Word. <BR> <BR>For some reason, InDesign seems to get
    everything right, EXCEPT the character that was mapped to nbspace &#40;00A0&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, until everything is Unicode compatible, I have to find
    a solution.

  body: 'OK, I&#39;ve made some headway on this.  <BR> <BR>Two things that helped:
    <BR> <BR>1.  I went back to an old postscript Type 1 version of the font issued
    with GreekKeys, &#34;Athenian&#34; &#40;circa 1991&#41; and saved the encoding,
    which I then used for the new remapped fonts. <BR> <BR>2.  Following John Hudson&#39;s
    advice, I changed the Microsoft Character Set in Font Info &#40;under Encoding
    and Unicode&#41; to &#34;Bitstream Font Set,&#34; to enforce the encoding. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>This was sufficient to get rid of the problem with iota acute and the
    Euro symbol swap. &#40;In the old encoding, iota acute is in the &#34;currency&#34;
    slot.&#41; <BR> <BR>But it did not get rid of the missing omega lenis acute &#40;which
    occupies the nbspace slot&#41; in certain applications. After extensive testing,
    here is what I discovered: <BR> <BR> <BR>A.  What is crucial to the GreekKeys
    keyboard is the &#42;index&#42; number of the glyph. Therefore, you have to have
    a glyph for every glyph in the Athenian font &#40;all 217 of them&#41;, and they
    have to be in the right order.  <BR> <BR>To get this, you have to start by appending
    an empty slot named &#34;.notdef&#34; which has the first index; and then paste
    each of the glyphs into a new font window, in the order their names appear in
    the GreekKeys encoding in Names mode. <BR> <BR>B.  But it also appears that the
    font can &#42;not&#42; have &#42;more&#42; than 217 glyphs. &#40;When I did, the
    letters collapsed on each other in both Word X and FrameMaker 7. I still don&#39;t
    understand why this happened.&#41;  <BR> <BR>So to solve the omega lenis acute
    problem, you have to replace an existing character, such as the backslash, in
    Names mode; then switch to Index mode, and drag and drop the appended glyph to
    the index slot occupied by backslash &#40;59&#41;; and then &#42;delete&#42; the
    backslash glyph, which is not in index slot 60. Then return to Names mode and
    generated the Mac suitcase. <BR> <BR>Anyway, that&#39;s what I did. Here are the
    results: <BR> <BR> <BR>Everything works fine in BBEdit, Word X, FrameMaker 7,
    and Endnote 6. The normal omega lenis acute is missing in InDesign and Mellel,
    but the secondary one substituting for backslash works fine. &#40;Iota acute,
    as noted, works fine.&#41; <BR> <BR>One oddity is that Mellel screws up on two
    other characters: eta acute iota subscript and eta asper iota subscript. &#40;It
    swaps them with pi and Omega, respectively, from some symbol font.&#41; <BR> <BR>On
    the other hand, my legacy documents are likely to go straight into InDesign. In
    Mellel, one can &#40;and should&#41; use a unicode version. <BR> <BR>Best, Victor'
