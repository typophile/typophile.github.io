  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've spent the last three weeks trying to stumble across a typeface of which i didn't know the name - i found out today that the typeface in question is FF Dax and has a similar cousin under the name of FF Sari.

Just wondering if anyone has any ideas as to the best place to buy this font family

Also, what is the general consensus? Is it already over-used, or is it a viable option for the right project? I think it would work well in a professional context maybe with another, subtle sans-serif based font... 

Any ideas would be appreciated!!
Thanks,
Jeremy Green</div>

		<div class="commentbody">FF Dax – the typeface is generally overused and often misused (it's a normal thing, because it is nearly a classic …). But that does not mean, there isn't a new sight on it possible. 

You can buy Dax, Sari at www.fontshop.com

Thanks for that - Daxline seems very similar to Dax & Sari - i think it's wider is it?

Still quite dear to buy... i'll have to keep looking.

So many companies are using it now - but half the time, it seems to be used very poorly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Jeremy,

The typographer.org posted a review about Daxline some time ago - I just stumbled across it today because we are in the super preliminary stages of a corporate redesign. The other designers and I are nearly in open revolt against FF Meta - bless Spiekermann, but I never want to see this face again - and were considering Daxline. Daxline was intended for text use, but we liked the proportions so much, I think we may try it out at display size a few times to see if we need to purchase Dax.

Daxline seems to loose some of the merits of the original Dax--the individuality and sweetness--though you might not get tired of it as soon. If you wanted a more usual look, I'd think maybe a different face altogether might work better, as you would't have the distraction of the stemless n m etc.  </div>

That whacky alternate a I must admit pulls the face together as far as visual logic, but maybe is too far out for a lot of use...

Kris - I'm quite fond of your karbon type and would be interested to see the finished product! As well, while we're dishing out compliments, your feijoa type really is very pretty - keep up the good work

I'm still quite a fan of the Dax family - the hairline and light would probably work well for displays.

I see Dax in a similar light. It is a bit self-conscious and "high-concept" (borrowing a term from the film indistry) but it holds up nonetheless. My main complaint is about Dax's reductive design qualities. Simple is good, but the omission of spurs make Dax a champion of reductive modernism. The face's popularity makes it influential for other typeface designs. That bugs me because I'd rather live in a world unaffected by  reductive modernism and "the failure of modernism".

		<div class="commentbody">Kris, I'm glad this peaks your curiosity. That's a good sign. Ganymede and Primex two of my early type designs from a time when I didn't know better. Making them taught me <em>why</em> reductive design is a dead end : )

In that sense, having made them qualifies me to recant and be critical of reductive design years later. I've been there and done it, and recoiled.

Primex suffers less from reductive properties than Ganymede does. Primex is benefits from its simplicity, whereas Ganymede seeks to disappear up its own arse. Its capitals have uses but its lower case is apparently pointless.

I can live with it, especially because having these samples posted helps illustrate my philosophy. I don't mind Kris posting them. I don't mean to be snarky either. I guess I'm just too principled---hung up on the distibution issue.

I'll try to be more accomodating in future.
