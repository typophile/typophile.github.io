  place around Birmingham later this month and wanted to let you know about one of
  our events:  [[http://stillwalking.org/sw12/marshall/ | Birmingham Graphic DNA]]\r\n\r\nGeraldine
  Marshall will lead a guided tour of the ad hoc lettering of the Digbeth area, reflecting
  on Birmingham\u2019s history of type design and the ever-evolving relationship between
  lettering and typography. \r\n\r\nThis links in with her research asking if the
  lettering and typography of the city has a regional accent analogous to that of
  spoken word.\r\n\r\nSaturday 24th of March, tickets are \xA34 each (+ booking fee).\r\n[[http://stillwalking.org/sw12/marshall/]]\r\n[[http://stillwalking.org/2012/03/01/birmingham_graphic_dna_digbeth_found_fonts/]]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nnikki"
