    down in the thread\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/62439\r\n\r\nHoang Dang seems
    to imply that SIL's .VIT treatment(s) are not proper; that the tone marks should
    ride over the different vowels. At least, that seems to be the logic of his remarks.
    Sadly, he never got back to answer the question. Has there been there any further
    discussion on this?"

  body: My understanding is that the SIL fonts have the alternates for languages other
    than Vietnamese. (Did Hoang talk about the SIL stuff, I couldn't find that bit?)
    For Vietnamese, the circumflex-acute and circumflex-grave should not have the
    second tier accents centred. The grave can go on the left or the right, depending
    on the design/designer/client. After long discussions, we chose to put it on the
    right, to be more consistent with other stacked marks and to reflect the writing
    direction (and reading direction, perhaps). It also requires less kerning exceptions
    that way.

  body: "The logic of Huang's remark was that the so-called \"accented\" characters
    were really not that, but different characters. Like in Latin, an \"e\" is not
    a \"c\" with a midline diacritic drawn through it.\r\n\r\nIn that case, and as
    Huang showed them, the tone marks would ride ABOVE the character, not beside what
    only looks like an accent. The left-right positioning is a different matter...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree that -in terms of reading, but not learning to read- it's best to
    view accented letters as individual letters, but an element* not being centered
    does not kill that. Also, facilitating good spacing (both horizontal and vertical)
    is not a design factor to be ignored, since poor spacing ruins readability much
    faster than mildly confusable glyph derivation.\r\n\r\n* BTW using the term \"tone
    mark\" actually reinforces what you seem to want to avoid.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "According the Wiki <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_alphabet\">Vietnamese
    Alphabet</a>, there are 12 vowels in Vietnamese, namely\r\n\r\na, \u0103, \xE2,
    e, \xEA, i, o, \xF4, \u01A1, u, \u01B0, y\r\n\r\nAccording to the same wiki, there
    are five tone accents that can be put on any of those vowels: grave accent, hook
    above, tilde, acute accent, dot below. It is also written, as Hoang Dang said,
    that the tone falls on the word. It is  also said that there are two styles of
    tone positioning and, more importantly\r\n<blockquote>\r\n In both styles, when
    one vowel already has a quality diacritic on it, the tone mark must be applied
    to it as well, regardless of where it appears in the syllable (thus thu\u1EBF
    is acceptable while th\xFA\xEA is not).\r\n </blockquote>\r\nTo my understanding,
    that rule goes against putting the tone where a linguist would put it and reasoning
    from general linguistic principles may not lead to what is expected by native
    readers.\r\n"

    it is something I know little about, esp. when it might be in conflict with another
    expert source?\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nSo -- Is the position of the tone marks due
    to mechanical issues of typewriter or typesetting? How does a native write the
    script longhand? Wouldn't that be the best answer?\r\n\r\nBTW, scansion marks
    in Latin have a similar, though not identical problem. They belong to a syllable,
    not a character (mirrors the older Vietnamese preference, no?) Further, I've argued
    scansion marks should always be at a constant height, so if a longum falls mainly
    over an l in one place, it should be at the same height when over, say, an e.
    They tell you how to parse something; they shouldn't bounce. Now, set some Greek
    poetry (polytonic Greek) with scansion marks...\r\n\r\nSo back to the question:
    if we remove all the things acknowledged as compromises (allowing they are sometimes
    necessary), does anyone know what is preferred? "

    those letters, it should not be hard to find which ones are vowels and which ones
    are consonants. That should confirm the list of vowels.\r\n\r\nAs for the treatment
    of &ldquo;<strong>tone mark (accent)</strong>&rdquo; (in bold in his post), he
    writes\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThere is only one accent. Someone considers Vietnamese
    as double accent language, but it's view of non-vietnamese speaking people.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nI

  body: "<blockquote>The only important thing for this thread is the shape of that
    thing and where to put it.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nExactly the question. As rendered
    by Adobe & SIL, sometimes those marks are essentially *beside* the character (given
    that the \"other accent\" isn't an accent, but part of the character). Now if
    it's an x-height character, then the mark is over. I'm not asking about the left-center-right
    position, but the height.\r\n\r\nEdit: And by the way, in order to fit it thus,
    the tone mark is rendered differently than when over those other characters. Shouldn't
    the rendering be consistent?"
