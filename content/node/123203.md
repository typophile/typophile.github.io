  body: "Note the variation in the shape of repeating letters. Handlettered in a popular
    Art deco style.\r\nThis is shown in a font by Jacob Erbar released in 1927 as
    Erbar Grotesk Garnitur \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErbarGroteskGarnitur1927SM_3524.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErbarGroteskGarnitur1927AsKNICK_4095.jpg]\r\nUnfortunately,
    the digital versions of Erbar Grotesk are  more conventional.\r\nThere are some
    digital fonts with some similarity to the Plakat lettering, such as Neutraface
    bold from House Industries [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeutrafaceHIbold_5342.gif]

  body: "Edited:\r\nToday's Trivia -- addressed mainly to English speaking readers.\r\nBerlin
    Alexanderplatz is an amazing novel by Alfred D\xF6blin, published in 1929. It
    relates the story of Franz Biberkopf, an ex-convict, who has to deal with misery,
    lack of opportunities, crime and the imminent Nazism lived in Germany during the
    1920s. During his struggle to survive against all odds, life rewards him with
    an unsuspected surprise but his happiness will not last as the story continues.
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Alexanderplatz.\r\nI have no information on
    the 1931 movie.\r\nBerlin Alexanderplatz  was made into a film mini-series for
    West German TV in 1980. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Alexanderplatz_%28miniseries%29\r\nI
    first saw in it the 1980s as a film art house series running about 16 hours. Its
    now available on DVD and includes English subtitles. I highly recommend it as
    a compelling story and character study.\r\nRegrettably, The publicity for the
    mini-series did not use this period appropriate lettering.\r\nDon\r\n"
