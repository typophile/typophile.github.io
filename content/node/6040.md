  body: 'Step one: go to the Kulturhuset and pick up a Stockholm Card. <BR> <BR>Stockholm
    is packed with museums of all sorts. I highly  <BR>recommend the Stockholm Card
    which gives you free admission <BR>to all and transportation for a week. <BR>
    <BR>Next door in the same building is a great design bookstore and <BR>down the
    hall is Design Torget - a great store with all sorts <BR>of well-designed gadgets
    and gifts. <BR> <BR>The <a href="http://www.modernamuseet.se/v4/templates/template6.asp?id=1745&amp;lang=Eng"
    target="_blank">Modern Museum</a> is excellent and generally free. The Museum  <BR>of
    Architecture and a small design gallery is next door.  <BR> <BR>The <a href="http://www.nationalmuseum.se/NMTemplates/NMSingle____3219.aspx"
    target="_blank">National Museum</a> has a nice collection of Swedish product  <BR>design.
    The bright orange globe televisions are my favorite.'
