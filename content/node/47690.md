  found this site sooner!\r\n\r\nI have a new client (Connecticut, USA) who's given
  me a scanned version of their logo, but I'd like to recreate it properly. It looks
  like a modified version of a typeface that I've seen, but I cannot place it. I don't
  know how long they've used it, but the company goes back to the late sixties.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any insight on this,\r\nAlan\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/valerio_logo01_5027.jpg]"
