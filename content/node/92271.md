  types, a classic serif display face.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MirandaProRegular-TextPreview-500x284_5989.png]\r\n\r\nSee

  body: "Yes, there are definitely some overshoot hinting problems in the sample.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also bummed that he's used the name \"Miranda,\" as I would have loved to be able
    to use it myself. It's my older daughter's name.\r\n\r\nNice typeface, though!"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, folks. Hinting is definitely one of my weakest areas
    in font development. Any suggestions where I should go to learn how to do it right/better?
    I'd love to learn and improve what I do.\r\n\r\nTim"

    Maybe that is why Dennis Pasternak chose Maiandra.\r\n"
