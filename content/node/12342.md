  been around for a while, but I'm back. And as I'm evolving in my life I felt I needed
  a new screenname. I'm currently rounding up my own website (http://www.characters.nl)
  so I've decided to change my name into 'Characters', so that it fits to what I'm
  about right now.\r\n\r\nSo in some time Luciddream will be gone and I will be know
  as Characters. Just that you know who is talking...\r\n\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

    That is some clever copywriting on your site."
