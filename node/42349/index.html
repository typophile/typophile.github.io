  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Morning all,

First of all, the nomenclature used for design on newspaper is new to me, so please excuse me if I'm totally out to lunch here. 

We're doing a two page ad that runs at the bottom of each page. Pretty simple, but the units given to us are a little perplexing, 40 agates high by 21 columns wide. Agate, at 5.5 pt each give me 220 pts high, but I'm at a loss as to what the "21 columns" implies.

I stumbled onto something that indicated that 1 column was equal to 14 agate, and something else that implied that this is not set in stone.

The rep at the paper seems MIA and we need to get this to them today and is further complicated by the fact that I am stepping in for another (now gone) designer who has created single page ads in the past, but the dimensions of those files don't ad up either.

Any insight?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The width seems to be 10 columns per page plus one added for the innermargins.

Over here in the Netherlands columns have been standardized for years — 40 mm per, with a 2 mm substraction for required whitespace (substracted for the total). 

Don't know about the US-situation ; )

In the newspaper industry, it is. 1 column inch (not 1 column) = 14 agate lines (exactly ... forget the 5.5 point stuff).

Another term you might run into is double truck, which is two full facing pages. Sort of what you have, but not the full height.

Back in the days when newspapers were kings, many papers had a rule that your ad could not be more than one column wide per 10 agate lines of height. These days, they will sell pretty much whatever they can.</div>

Get the specs in inches or millimeters or whatever you are comfortable with.

		<div class="commentbody">Newspapers are getting smaller. Narrower to be specific. A full page ad in New York Times used to be 13" x 21" now it is 11.5" x 21".

LA Times used to be 11.5" x 21.5" now it is 10.88" x 21.5".

Ink coverage has dropped also - LA Times is now 220 Dmax. I guess when you add all that up you save a bit of money.
