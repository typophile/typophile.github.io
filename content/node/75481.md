  value from a glyph in one font and applies them to a glyph in another font.\r\n\r\nThe
  name transfer works fine but I'm getting this error trying to set the unicode:\r\nFile
  \"<string>\", line 9, in ?\r\nTypeError: CXX: type error.\r\n\r\nThe line of code
  looks like this:\r\nfl.glyph.unicode = GUni\r\n\r\nwhere GUni is the variable holding
  the Unicode value. I've tried using hex(GUni) thinking maybe it needed a hex string
  but no go.\r\n\r\nAny help would be most appreciated.\r\n"
