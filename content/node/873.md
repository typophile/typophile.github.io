  the type system consists of Trajan as titles, and the palatino family to take care
  of the rest, they/we are wanting to move to a more mordern appearence, from a more
  classical one. <BR> <BR>My question to you folk is this: <BR> <BR>The logo is in
  place &#40;for now&#41; and is basically a reversed out trajan. &#40;see here <a
  href="http://www.sharingway.com" target="_blank">http://www.sharingway.com</a>&#41;
  <BR>I am looking for a good san-serif face to pair with trajan. it has to have professional
  appeal, but needs to be a touch friendly, just not to cold. It also needs a fairly
  complete family &#40;ie. small caps, italics, and several weights, ligatures are
  always sexy too&#41; <BR> <BR>So, this said, any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanks.'

  body: I would love to use Fedra-sans -- But we are currently re-doing the ID for
    our firm, and using Fedra serif. so I think might be too close. But I love that
    face.

  body: It needs to work well in rather large text blocks, but should be versitle
    enough to set in big advertisment type titles. Im considering NOT using Trajan
    at all, simple because of its over use and abuse, especialy in the whole &#34;film&#34;
    world. But I&#39;m not sure I can get buy without it, being that is is incorporated
    into the logo.

  body: 'I love Giacome, very nice and lively blend, I feel, between American Gothic
    and Italian Renaissance attitude, legible yet not bland. It could do with a small
    caps set, although the Sc should be part of the OTF-File... maybe an update for
    users or something? I wonder though, what Stephen doesn&#39;t like about the a.  <BR>
    <BR>Emigre&#39;s Priori by J.B. is also wonderful, although not really a very
    legible font, a bit too different. Still, I&#39;m waiting for the right job to
    justify buying the set... I love the capital letters they did for the sans serif. '

  body: 'James, that&#39;s pretty good news about Giacomo SC :-&#41;. It&#39;s always
    keen to have non-Adobe-folks adopt the OTF-Pro-format &#40;when Linotype et al
    seem to be content with just converting old fonts to OTF without using the pro
    features&#41;, and your typographic style on Giacomo and Clearview is, as I said,
    legible and clear and thus a solid alternative to other, more overused sans serif
    typefaces. So I sure hope you find the time to do some more OTF stuff :-D. '

    find that Eric Gill, as the stone-cutter he was, designed the upper case characters
    to be very close in proportion to the inscriptions chiseled on the Trajan column.

  body: Kyle, are you looking for a face for use in text, or a secondary typeface
    to use with your Trajan logotype?  <BR> <BR>We just did a system that uses Trajan
    in the logotype, with Meta as the secondary typeface. I thought it was an odd
    pairing at first, but it works. I think it might work as your text face - it is
    fairly complete &#40;with small gaps and lining numerals, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    know Meta was SO used for a while, but it&#39;s &#34;trend&#34; status seems to
    have subsided a bit of late. You might just take a look.

    means you could fake smallcaps adequately. You know all about that, don&#39;t

    <BR> <BR>Now I am trying to decide between Meta and Giacomo. Meta seems to be
    a little more freehearted, although I love the appeal of a lesser &#39;used&#39;
    face like Giacomo.  <BR> <BR>Hmmm..  That hundred dollar difference might be the

    <BR>On an additional note FontFont was very helpful in sending .pdf samples. and

    them, they had it emailed to me. <BR>

    It has a sans serif companion, <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-vesta.html">Vesta</a>,

    <BR> <BR>Same here. After years of not using Meta, I was verrry close to using
    it again on a job some days ago and found it quite pleasing, but still decided
    on FFInfo, as the job needed a bit of a more static and computer-like feel while
    still maintaining legibility. Still, you don&#39;t see Meta too often anymore,
    and the font itself is good work. We still could use a MetaLight, imo, though.
    And of course, full OpenType Treatment. Makes sense with all those foreign language
    sets already devbeloped at MetaDesign/FontShop.  <BR> <BR>And James... for a small
    foundry, Giacomo does come with a rather painful price tag attached. The OTF made
    me buy it, but still... prices like these are what keeps me from buying Bliss
    and a batch of Lineto Fonts. Your work is outstanding, and I&#39;m all for paying
    the price a speicific work is worth, but when even works by Luc&#40;as&#41; de
    Groot and Fontshop are less expensive, it makes the decision to get your fonts
    a bit harder. A few Euro more and I could have bought the wonderful Taz III. And
    over at Chester&#39;s and Rick&#39;s you get the great section at 99$... now THAT
    is an incentive :-D.  <BR> <BR>Still, Giacomo is well worth the money spent &#40;maybe
    the Upgrade can be for free, though, hinthintnudgenudgewinkwink...&#41; Would&#39;ve
    bought Clearview as well, but my money was all spent... we&#39;re finally moving
    into a larger house/bureau and I&#39;m pretty broke after buying the whole thing. '

  body: Well billing, haha, thats a tricky subject. <BR> <BR>In my case it is subjective.
    <BR> <BR>With purchasing something like a type face, with some clients we would
    mark it up by 10-20%, with some clients that price might need to be burried within
    something else. Sometimes we might not even mark up for a type face, if it is
    something that we are basically bying to use once or twice on some client work
    and then keep for our own use later. I think realisticly you have to take things
    like this on a case by case basis. <BR> <BR>I know some that would be fine with
    purchasing fonts. I know other thats would say, &#34;What th hell? $360 for a
    font? Why didnt you just use something you had&#34; and would then begin thinking
    that you are trying to cheat them in some way. <BR> <BR>Like I said with us, we
    have decided that billing for things of this nature needs to be delt with on a
    client by client basis. <BR>Were not the biggest firm, but we do have a good a
    good amount of people, and a modest sized client base.

    padding the project expenses when you write the  <BR>estimate, if you foresee

    and can be for  <BR>fonts, especially if it&#39;s more of a specialty face that
    you will  <BR>have a hard time reusing in your studio. <BR> <BR>b&#41; If you
