  is proud to announce the release of <strong><a href=\"http://www.veer.com/download/pdf/feelscript.pdf\">Feel
  Script (PDF here)</a></strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feeltypophile_6483.png]\r\n\r\nFeel
  Script is based on lettering that calligrapher and logo designer Rand Holub created
  for Intertype for his face Monterey. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have the technological
  limitations today that Intertype had back then. Holub\u2019s lettering is presented
  in its entirety within Feel Script. Some letterforms were redrawn from vintage American
  magazine ads (some by Holub himself), along with many new alternates, ligatures,
  ending forms, and strangely beautiful character combinations. The experience I\u2019ve
  accumulated from my previous calligraphy typefaces (Ministry Script, Affair, Buffet
  Script, Burgues Script, et al.) made it easier for me to apply Holub\u2019s lettering
  in a new context using OpenType technology. The usual extended treatment was given
  to Feel Script, all the way into the implementation of three-letter ligatures and
  the dreamiest swashes I could imagine. I changed some of the connections between
  the lowercase letters in order to fit Holub\u2019s calligraphy as opposed to the
  limited Intertype metal attempt.\r\nI hope you like Feel Script. I also hope what
  I contributed to this particular Holub design is somewhat of a happy ending to a
  calligraphy story that crosses many technologies. From the pen to computer B\xE9zier.
  My part of this story stops here ... and yours begins.\r\nFeel Script has more than
  1200 glyphs including: stylistic alternates, contextual alternates, titling alternates,
  swashes, and ligatures.\r\n\r\nMore about <a href=\" http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000300#specimen\">Feel

    You are making a great contribution to increased Worldwide typographic beauty.
    I'm in awe, and also quite jealous.\r\n\r\n I love this style of (50's?) lettering.
    I expect to see it in the Veer 'What's Hot' list very soon!\r\n\r\nWell done.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick
