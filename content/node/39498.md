body: "I'm getting close to the point where I'll be adding the next weight to my current
  typeface project. Ideally, I've always wanted to be able to set the kerning and
  metrics for the Regular weight, and then automatically apply that to the Light and
  Bold weights, with the values being adjusted accordingly to accomodate the new glyph
  widths.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I'm thinking about writing a script that will copy the
  metrics and kerning values from one font to another, expanding or contracting them
  by the difference in glyph widths on a per-glyph basis. Theoretically, assuming
  the fonts are simply different weights of the same typeface, this SHOULD work; there
  shouldn't be any need for additional hand tweaking, as the results should essentially
  be a perfect version of what I might have originally tried to do manually. Ultimately,
  since the glyphs are all identical aside from their heavier or lighter weights,
  the kerning and metrics should be identical too; just narrower or wider. In other
  words, it should all be relative.\r\n\r\nBefore I get started though, am I missing
  anything obvious? Is there any reason why this wouldn't work as smoothly as I'm
  assuming? I don't mean technical/coding concerns, I just mean problems with the
  overal strategy from a designer's perspective. I wanted to do a sanity check on
  the idea before I wasted my time actually implementing it."

  body: "I don't think that would work, at least not better than copying exactly the
    kerning values. The kerning depends not on the advance width but on the shape
    of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nAnother question: which glyph of the pair would you use
    as a reference, the left or the right one? Probably the average, I guess.\r\n\r\nBtw,
    if you want to scale all kerning equally, disregarding the individual glyph widths,
    you can do that by changing the UPM value of the font. That probably brings better
    results than on a per-glyph basis."

  body: "Well this is operating under the premise that you're copying the kerning
    from one weight of the same typeface to another. Just to be clear, I'm not suggesting
    this would have any use if one were to copy the kerning and metrics from one typeface
    to an entirely different typeface. In other words, the shape of each glyph is
    the same; it's merely wider due to widened strokes and proportions. The idea isn't
    that the shapes are exactly identical, but rather that they're so similar, aside
    from their differences in width, that kerning and metrics from one weight to another
    are essentially the same, differing only by said difference in width.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, the kerning distance between A and V in a bold weight should be the
    same as the light weight; this script would allow that to be ported over, adjusting
    the kerning numerically to compensate for the wider glyphs but ultimately producing
    the same visual distance. Likewise, the space between letters based on sidebearings
    should also be the same from one weight to another; it merely needs to be adjusted
    when copied to take into account the wider glyph the sidebearings are surrounding."

  body: "Alex, I suggest you check other fonts that have some relation to yours stylistically.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, bolder weights are spaced more tightly. For example, Minion's regular
    O has side bearings on both sides of 44. The bold O has 42 left and 41 right.
    According to Tracy's \"Letters of Credit\" this is recommended because the letter
    space should be related to the counter width, and the counters are generally narrower
    in bolder weights of the same type family. So Tracy does not accept your view
    that similar exterior shapes always take the same spacing. \r\n\r\nI think Tracy's
    view is accepted by most type designers today. "

  body: "Makes sense. Looks like I was approaching the problem with too clinical a
    mindset. Oh well, my aim was to ensure consistency among weights, not to save
    myself work, so I have no problem performing the kerning manually in each case.
    It also saves me the time of writing the script. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for the insight,
    guys."

  body: "Alex, I think your theory does not work for regular/bold.\r\n\r\nIt would
    work for copying between different widths of the same weight. Here, the slope
    of the A and V would actually change with the width of the letter. The \"sideways-pointing\"
    shape and width coincide.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that bold weights are generally
    wider does not mean that the \"sideways-pointing\" shape is any different. In
    fact, the A and V of a bold font can easily have precisely the same angle as in
    the regular \u2013 the only reason for the increase in width being the increase
    in stem weight. And if the angles of A and V stay the same you should probably
    not scale their kerning.\r\n\r\nBut as William mentioned, the bold is spaced more
    tightly, which changes everything anyway."

    script. Use it like this:\r\nDo some kerning for one master in the Kerning Panel.
    Then run the script to 'expand' the current master's kerning to all other masters.
    Switch to another master and do some kerning. -- Each time you switch to another
    master, run this script first.\r\nOnly if you find that kerning is ok in all masters
    (remember: as of yet a pair has the same kerning value throughout all masters!),
    you adjust individual masters' kerning <em>without</em> running the script.\r\n\r\nKarsten"
