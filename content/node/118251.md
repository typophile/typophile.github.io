body: "I'm perplexed. I'm building a font family of a script. There are four different
  font files (vfb). All are very similar and I plan to eventually 'merge' them into
  one Pro version of the font. All of them generate OTF files just fine except for
  one file. When I generate IT, I get the following message in the FontLab output
  panel:\r\n\r\n<strong>[WARNING] <MyFontName> feature 'kern', referenced in aalt
  feature, either is not defined or had no rules which could be included in the aalt
  feature.</strong>\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what I am missing? I've tried to research
  it, and can't figure it out. \r\n\r\nThis particular font appears to work just as
  well as the others (which do not give any warning message), but I'm wondering what,
  if any problems this may cause in the future. \r\n\r\nShould I even be concerned,
  if the font works fine in applications like InDesign? Or will Microsoft Word regurgitate
  it?"

  body: "Well, the question is why the other fonts are not giving you conniptions,
    not why this one is.\r\n\r\n'aalt' is a substitution feature that acts as a catch-all
    for other substitution features. You can't stick 'kern' in it and expect anything
    good to happen.\r\n\r\nIf you have no other, real, substitution features, then
    you don't need aalt."

  body: "Thomas, I will be adding the other OT features later. I have found that if
    I don't have the 'kern' feature, the font generates fine, but when I go into Indesign
    to test it, the kerning pairs are not loading. \r\n\r\nI assumed that if I had
    any features (like 'kern'), I would need to have the 'aalt' feature form them
    to be accessed. I have removed the 'aalt' feature, and now things seem to be generating
    fine without the warning message. So thanks for that. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if
    I will need to add it back in when I created the other features (like 'salt' and
    'liga' etc.)\r\n\r\nthanks again for the help"

  body: You don't have to have 'aalt', but it is considered good form. It's just that
    'kern' should never be placed in 'aalt', as it does not access alternate glyphs.

  body: "Rob, \r\nIf you have just the regular standard character set filled out you
    could use the liga feature to add at least one feature. \r\nLike:\r\nfeature liga
    {\r\n  sub f l by fl;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nThis type of substitution does not need
    to have the aalt feature either, but when you add features like calt where a specific
    character gets subbed by another then add that to aalt."

  body: Or you could just completely ignore {aalt}. It was a workaround devised by
    Adobe to drive early versions of their glyph palettes. Not only does it not have
    any practical use for font users, it isn't even needed to drive the font palette,
    which can derive the same information from parsing all the GSUB features for one-to-one
    substitution lookups.
