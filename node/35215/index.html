<div class=commentbody>Arial Rounded for the "Refreshment Area".
But for the direction signs, I can only say they use the same typeface in Glasgow in Scotland.
[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~owend/I/R/stnpages/glasgowcentralsign.jpg]]
Reminds me of Corpid, but the 'g' and 'i' are obviously different.</div>

At fist I thought Glasgow would be British Rail, which I beleive uses it's own exclusive typeface called, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Alphabet>"Rail Alphabet",</a> fittingly enough - By Jock Kinneir & Margaret Calvert. But perhaps you are right. your sample is not Rail Alphabet.
The Glasgow face is very close to the Dublin on, but there seem to be some subtle differences to the top curve of the lowercas 'a' and the tail of the lowercase 'g'. The 'C' is a bit more open too, I think. Again - sorry about the photos
I think I'll just write Irish Rail and ask what it is & report back. :)

<div class=commentbody>Glad to see something of a local flavour being discussed. I’ve talked at length with friends here (Ireland) about <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1221/811270354_689e4b1f3b.jpg?v=0">this typeface</a> as it puzzles me greatly. Apologies for the verbose posting.
The original Córas Iompair Éireann (CIE) corporate typeface was designed by [[Tony Fahy]] in 1999/2000 and was called CIE2000 <em>or</em> CIE2K. You can check it out <a href=http://www.tonyfahy.com/html/type_design.html>here</a>. To be honest it is quite ugly.
Subsequently, (I have heard) it was cleaned-up by another Irish designer. Whether this new typeface is the cleaned up version, I don’t know. They both share some similar characteristics.
To add to the mystery, the new typeface is used by CIE in all of their annual reports (available <a href=http://www.cie.ie/about_us/annual_reports.asp>here</a>) under the name Nexus Sans. The typeface is obviously <strong>not</strong> <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_nexus_sans/>Nexus Sans</a> by [[Martin Majoor]].

<div class=commentbody>Off the topic of the type ID maybe, but wouldn’t it be nice if <a href=http://www.cie.ie/>CIE</a> (Irish Railways) went back to their old 1940s logo? It looks a lot more modern and robust than anything they’ve had since.

<div class=commentbody>@ connor,
Thank you very much for that!
It seems to me that there's more than one typeface in use. The signs pictured above don't have the rounded corners of CIE 2000.
I have actually written to CIE to ask what typefaces they use. I'll let you know what they say if I get a reply.
@ Kellie Strøm,
You're right. the old one is better. More fitting anyways. The donut logo seems a bit nautical... Like a life preserver or a loop of rope.</div>

No problem.

I’m looking forward to finding out the actual name of the typeface.

<div class=commentbody>Above and beyond, Conor, :)
Were the photos in my first post of Heuston Station? My wife's been in Ireland for about a week and has been sending back a steady stream of photos of signage.
I was struck by the 2nd place status Gallic seems to have on CIE signage. I would not get away with that in Canada. English and French have to have equal weight on any thing that has to be bilingual. (except in Quebec, where English signs aren't allowed :)

> <cite>equal weight</cite>
We (like Canada) have our <a href=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0032/print.html>Official Languages Act (2003)</a>… however it only governs public bodies. The Government has been lazy in implementing it consistently. Irish road signage is famously farcical. As far as older signage is concerned, I’m sure you understand <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland#History>why English is given preference</a>.
;^)
> <cite>Gallic</cite>
It’s Gaeilge or Irish, definitely not <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaulish_language>Gallic</a>.
I hope your wife enjoys her time here.</div>

That CIE logo looks like a derivative of London Transport's roundel. Kind of surprising given it post-dates independence?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, it has that about it. It's also a winged wheel, though, as used by a number of European state railways.
For example <a href=http://www.trainweb.org/theattic/Gav7.jpg>Sweden</a>, <a href=http://www.trainweb.org/theattic/Gav15.jpg>old</a> and <a href=http://funini.com/train/sweden/imgs/rc6.jpg>new</a>.
And <a href=http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/railways/Denmark/diesel/dsb_mx_1.jpg>Denmark</a>, again <a href=http://www.railorama.dk/fotos/dk/dsb/d/mzii/pwmz1423.jpg>here</a> and <a href=http://www.design.kk.dk/db/filarkiv/15976/Hovedbanen.JPG>a big jpeg here</a>. Sadly the Danish winged wheel has been <a href=http://www.dsb.dk>Nikefied</a>.
The old CIE version is quite close to the <a href=http://www.austria.info/scms/media.php/4598/19365.jpg>Austrian</a> railway logo, barely identifiable as a winged wheel.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry to drag up an old post, but I thought I'd answer Conor's question about the Nexus Sans typeface currently used by Irish Rail (Iarnód Éireann).
In 2003 I was commissioned by a company called Creative Inc. to audit and redesign the CIE 2K font, originally designed by Tony Fahy. The redesigned font is called ‘Nexus Sans’.
A absolute condition of the redesign was that I had to conserve the basic characteristics of the CIE2K font.
First I carried out qualitative research in three areas:
1. how the CIE 2K font was being used,
2. whether its design was suitable for that use, and
3. an evaluation of its standard of technical execution.
The research showed that CIE2K was conceived as a display font, not intended for use at small sizes, or for station signage for that matter. Regardless of the aesthetic qualities of the font, it suffered greatly from regular misuse and inappropriate application. Irish Rail had received negative feedback from staff and customers about the font's legibility. A vivid example was the truck driver who crashed into a railway overpass and claimed he could not read warning signs (set in CIE2K) of the height restrictions.
With six different weights, I felt that CIE2K was too complex for use as a cross platform corporate identity font. My redesign, ‘Nexus Sans’, specified just three weights to make it easier to use and added basic glyphs such as the euro currency symbol as well as optional tabular figures for setting timetables.
My redesign sought to keep the references to brush-drawn Gaelic calligraphy, while making letterforms and letter-spacing more consistent. The font is now comfortable to read at small sizes and less idiosyncratic in appearance.
I also recommended that ‘Nexus Sans’ be restricted to printed corporate communications, and that a separate font should be considered for the special requirements of online and signage typography.
One year after I had finished and named the font, Martin Majoor released his beautiful ‘Nexus Sans’ in 2004. An unfortunate coincidence, but not significant since the Irish Rail corporate font is not sold commercially, and I hope people would think better of comparing such dissimilar designs.
The Creative Inc website shows some examples of Irish Rail Nexus Sans and the excellent Brunel font used for station signage.
