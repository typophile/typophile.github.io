		<div class="commentbody">It was not for that purpose.  <BR> <BR>Basically i call it a sagmeister rip off because it is what he did, but! <BR> <BR>I personally did it because i feel i can express my personality in a much more profound way then sticking &#39;alex haigh creative design&#39; in helvetica neue on a business card, i dont think there is any design in minimalism when it comies to business cards as the worlds full of them. <BR> <BR>My representation was to suggest i am extremely passionate about what the industry i am hoping to enter, the fact that design is skin deep for me and it is not just &#39;a job&#39;, i wanted to give it a meterphoric meaning show my future employees how i try to express design not just aesthetically but with ideas to. <BR> <BR>As for secure job, it isnt &#39;secure&#39; as i go on a trial week, if i get offered a job by a better agency or better pay or personal circumstances for me then i will take it, i am trying to make myself as employable and &#39;wanting&#39; as possible. <BR> <BR>Yes i fully understand no CD or SD will have the time, so thats why i want to create something that could possibly open doors for me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi <BR> <BR>Over the past ten years I have had quite a bit of experience of this, from trying to find a job, to interviewing for my own agency. <BR> <BR>I found that the best route was to call up and ask if people could spare 15 minutes to look at my work. I never asked for a job, just for advice. <BR> <BR>Next, when I went to visit an agency I would ask if they could recommend any other good places to approach. Sometimes they would call up and make an appointment with friends at other agencies for me. <BR> <BR>My business partner loves it when people send a letter thanking her for seeing them. She gave a job to someone for that reason once. <BR> <BR>From your point of view, you should be asking for placements. Try and line up a whole string of them, most people will pay you something. This puts you top of the list if a job does become available. <BR> <BR>From the hiring point of view, I like to see good work. But  a lot of people have good work. I want someone who wants to learn more... so I would never say that you think you are good. <BR> <BR>I personally think that most graduates don&#39;t try to find work, they might mail out a cv, or a CD-ROM, but if they really want a job they have to put in more work. The only way to find work is to get sat down with your folio in front of someone. If you get a placement, just make yourself really useful, not only in terms of design, but by offering to cut stuff out, buy coffee, anything which makes you look like you&#39;ll work your &#149;&#149;&#149; off. <BR> <BR>Good Luck <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>=== <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.sumodesign.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.sumodesign.co.uk</a></div>

Or like Picasso said: <BR>&#39;Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain <BR>an artist once he grows up.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;create something that could possibly open doors for me&#39; <BR>Key words &amp; symbols which turn matter into spirit. <BR> <BR>Like Mr. Jim Richardson said, caffein help fo&#39; sure. <BR>I read somewhere that if you yell for 8 years, 7 months <BR>and 6 days you would have produced enough sound energy <BR>to heat one cup of coffee.  <BR> <BR>Recently I found out this forum, <a href="http://www.chinwag.com" target="_blank">www.chinwag.com</a>, do <BR>you know ?

It is you who I wish to  <BR>share my body with, she said. We&#39;ll find a dry  <BR>place under the sky with a flower for a bed And  <BR>for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and <BR>star on his head. Her silver hair flowed in the  <BR>air laying waves across the sun Her hands were  <BR>like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds  <BR>on. We left the road and headed up to the top of <BR>the Whisper Wood And we walked &#39;till we came to  <BR>where the holy magnolia stood. And there we laid <BR>cool in the shade singing songs and making love... <BR>With the naked earth beneath us and the  <BR>universe above. The time was late my wedding  <BR>wouldn&#39;t wait I was sad but I had to go, So  <BR>while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for  <BR>cheerio. The wedding took place and people came  <BR>from many miles around There was plenty  <BR>merriment, cider and wine abound But out of all  <BR>that I recall I remembered the girl I met &#39;Cause <BR>she had given me something that my hear could not <BR>forget. A year had passed and everything was just <BR>as it was a year before... As if was a year  <BR>before... Until the gift that someone left, a  <BR>basket by my door. And in there lay the fairest  <BR>little baby crying to be fed, I got down on my  <BR>knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.  <BR>As years went by the boy grew high and the  <BR>village looked on in awe They&#39;d never seen  <BR>anything like the boy with the moon and star  <BR>before. And people would ride from far and wide  <BR>just to seek the word he spread I&#39;ll tell you  <BR>everything I&#39;ve learned, and love is all... <BR>he said. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: CS_theboy-54468.unk*attachment_icon.gif*application/octet-stream*96.8**CS_theboy%2emp3 --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif" align=left alt="application/octet-stream"><br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/CS_theboy-54468.unk" target="_blank"><b>CS_theboy.mp3</b></a> (96.8 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>
