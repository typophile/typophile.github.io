  and called bauhaus-bugler http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/breauhare/bauhaus-bugler/\r\nwas
  not a bit too inspired by one my release called Qero also available at MyFonts here:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typofabric/qero-nite/\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'This is the problem with programmatic type design: someone else can come
    up with the same programme, and the results will inevitably be similar. I note
    that the description for Bauhaus Bugler type says it was designed in 1975, which
    is believable based on the style, and it wasn''t an original idea even then.'
