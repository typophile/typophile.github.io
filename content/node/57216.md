body: "I was inspired by a photo of some old letters on a building. So I decided to
  make my first sans serif typeface. These are some promo pieces I made. The font
  is called Gloria and will be released at Letterhead Fonts on April 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Borges_5411.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  had alot of fun making it. Quite a different process than making a script face,
  thats for sure :)\r\n\r\n-Charles Borges de Oliveira\r\n\r\nwww.borgeslettering.com\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Charles, \r\n\r\nWas it inspired by this photo of mine by any chance?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gloria_6678.jpg]\r\n\r\nThat
    is the sign of the old cinema in Bytom in southern Poland. I'm actually doing
    some drawings now based on it, in very soft pencils to get the weathered and repainted
    look of the metal.\r\nI've been meaning to get back to you after your kind comments
    on my [[http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/justin.chodzko/SignsPostersLetteringAndType?authkey=Gv1sRgCKHDsNe9t_iK5wE#|Picasa
    photo album]], but was waiting until I had added some more pictures, which I have
    now done. There should be more in about a week including some lovely hand-lettering
    on some early '70s Polish childrens books."
