  am not interested in the V flourish as much as the standard font that is used on
  most of the lettering. The title and the author's name look like two different weights
  of the same font.\r\n\r\nI need this font for a project and need to recreate this
  look!\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the Uk version...\r\n\r\n<url>http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0552149519.02.LZZZZZZZ.jpg</url>\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nArtifice"
