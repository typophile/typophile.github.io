  move it moderators, i wasnt sure .\r\n\r\nim asking myself the following things:\r\n\r\n-
  i found ITC magnifico in several different stores from fontshop to fonts.com, etc..
  the prices range from 30\u20AC up to 45$ for exactly the same font.\r\n- in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=magnifico\">fontshop</a>,
  there's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=ITC.108270.0.0\">one
  copy by ITC</a> and then there's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.106143.0.0\">one
  thats 8\u20AC less</a> but appears to have exactly the same characterset - what
  now?\r\n- the monotype/itc-shop is the only one which sells the <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.aspx?PID=205028\">opentype-version</a>
  - does anybody know if there's any difference between the normal TT/PS-font and
  the OT-version? its 15$ more, so i'd only get it if it really has some \"special\"
  features.\r\n\r\ni find it very disappointing that, unlike many others, im ready
  to pay for fonts even if i'll just use it in my freetime, but then i have to look
  around hours just to find the reseller that gives me the best price while not having
  exact information on different versions. or is there anything else i should take
  into consideration when chosing a shop? (im from switzerland if that matters..)\r\n
  \r\nthanks for any help! im a bit lost with this question.."

    looking at essentially the same font, available from different foundries. The
    Creative Alliance version was licensed from ITC by Monotype and they chose to
    sell it at a different price. Now that Monotype owns the ITC collection it seems
    strange that they still offer it through both foundries, I know.\r\n\r\nThe OpenType
    version is sometimes priced higher for no other reason than it offers simplicity
    (1 file) and cross-platformability (Mac and Windows). For some folks, this convenience
    is worth a few extra bucks.\r\n\r\nI understand a bit of confusion in seeing the
    same font data for different fees, but I have to ask: you're spending hours to
    save $15? That's not too grand a price break."

  body: "stephen, thanks alot for your reply and thanks for your insight on those
    foundry-stories.\r\n\r\nits clear to me that any vendor decides how he wants to
    sell and price his products, i have a business education :). what really annoys
    me is the fact that there's no clear and structured information about different
    releases or some kind of meta-search / froogle where one could find all possible
    vendors for a specific font. well, maybe thats a business idea on its own :)\r\n\r\nits
    30$ because its two fonts, and yes, 30$ are enough for me spend a few minutes
    searching - im doing an internship, not a well paid job, and afterall, this is
    for personal use, not for paid jobs.\r\n\r\nif there's anybody here that knows
    of a even better deal than the fontshop-32$-version? im just asking, if not, i'll
    probably get that one."
