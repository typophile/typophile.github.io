  didn't come to definite conclusion. I have been looking for a font that goes with
  modern typographic trends in webdesign BUT it's not sans-serif. It has to be clean,
  non-traditionalm, web 2.0 :D serif font.\r\n\r\nI really love <a href=\"http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=15\"><strong>Morgan
  Avec</strong></a>, Precious and basically this kind of serif fonts, but I was wondering
  if you know some alternatives. It doesn't have to be exactly the same style - just
  something display / web friendly and of course good lookin'.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\ngonee"
