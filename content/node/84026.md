body: "Hello. Two Chandler & Price Pilot Letterpresses were recovered in Mexico. Restoration
  is required. I ask the community for 1) documentation about this specific model
  of the Chandler & PrIce Pilot letterpress, 2) advise on where to purchase pieces
  and even identical machines. \r\nFor the record, both machines belonged to a Mexican
  revolutionary exiled in the US, circa 1906.\r\nThank you very much. \r\nSome images.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C-P-Pilot_4757.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6357.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_7295_5207.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://issuu.com/diegofloresmagon"

    Should you run accross any of these worthy of restoring perhaps we can help. If
    the press is broken perhaps we might buy it for parts. In any case check out our
