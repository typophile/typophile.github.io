body: Hello! I'm trying to find the typeface Jessica Hische uses for the navigational
  items on her site (Type, Design, Illustration, Back, More etc.) I'm being tripped
  up by the nice little flourishes in the K, R, etc. Is it possible that it's a custom
  typeface? Alternatives are also welcome, I really like the proportions that one
  has going on-- wide but compact, legible very small, etc. Thanks! [[http://www.jessicahische.com/]]
