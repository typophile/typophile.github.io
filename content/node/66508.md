  body: Given the D signature, I would say "Lazy D.", but it would sound more rapper
    than monogrammer. ;-)

    1952, a supplement to Sign Slogans and Snap Shots.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/modernsignsbook_4826.jpg]\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nMatthews
    comments:\r\n\r\nThis elaborate piece of work was done 75 years ago and it was
    published in a big five dollar book \"Alphabets, Monograms, Initials, Crests,
    Etc.\" back in 1885. I have one of the few copies still in existence. The original
    drawing measured 7 3/8 x 9 inches.\r\n\r\nRipley once drew up a simplified version
    of it for use in his \"Believe it or Not.\" I have heard that the inventor of
    the linotype machine went crazy because of the very intricate work involved. But
    I don't know what became of this modest artist who simply signed the monogram
    with the initial D.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nI picked up that 121 page supplement, which
    is full of fantastic stuffs,  and a first edition The Book of 100 Type Face Alphabets
    by J. I. Beigeleisen, for just 5 bucks!\r\n\r\n"

    awesome monogram gets out there :) Several people have mentioned they want it
    tattooed!!  "
