body: "This is a birthday greeting card I have recently designed for my sisters birthday.
  After it's success in my family I have decided to screen print copies in black and
  red as below, possibly variations using other colours too, which I will then put
  up for sale on www.etsy.com at a price of \xA34.00 or there about.\r\n\r\nBefore
  I do this though I wanted to get your opinions, would you buy this greeting card
  for a friend or family? (The small type in the corner of this card would not be
  included as it was specific to my sister's birthday only).\r\n\r\nLet me know what
  you think :)\r\n\r\n(Note: the small tear on this card would not happen when silk
  screened, it was due to hand crafting the red using masking tape and acrylic)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Probably not, but only because I think you're asking the wrong question for
    this audience.\r\n\r\nIt looks really nice; creative, well-executed, etc, but
    we'd be more likely to make our own than to buy one. Your sales target is of people
    who are less likely to have the talent or know-how to do create a card themselves.
    Maybe a more appropriate question would be \"Is this worth selling on etsy?\".\r\n\r\nYes.
    Definitely."

  body: "Thank you microspective, what you are saying makes sense, I actually never
    thought of it like that. I would answer the same if somebody made a similar post,
    I always make my own so why would I buy one.\r\n\r\nIn response, for future answers,
    can you all answer the question \"Is this worth selling on Etsy\"?\r\nThanks :)\r\n"

    \"Would you buy this?\".\r\n\r\n; )"

  body: "I think if you marketed it properly\u2014description of materials/method,
    nice photographs\u2014it might sell.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I can't see why anyone
    would pay \xA34 for it. I don't browse etsy much these days, is that the market
    rate for a card like this?"

  body: I understand what you're saying, if I explain that it is hand screen printed
    on 200gsm rough finish grey card etc.. and sell it properly, it might reach the
    target market better?
