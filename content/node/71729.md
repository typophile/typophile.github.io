  condensed. Ideally, I'd love to find a stencil version of 'Gravur' the Lineto font
  as it has a wonderful utilitarian feel to it, so if anyone has any suggestions I'd
  really welcome them.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nArran"

  body: Ok, thanks guys. Alas neither are quite what I'm looking for, but what I've
    actually been trying is to create a stencil version of Gravur. Alas, the problem
    in doing this is that it ends up looking quite like those stencil sets you get
    from stationery shops! Oh well. Thanks for your help.
