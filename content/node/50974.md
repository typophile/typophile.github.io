body: "'Tomate' has been released. It started in 2006 as a brush lettering exercise
  for a poster and was later used for the ReType identity. In 2008 its author decided
  to turn it into a super fat typeface suitable for packaging and mass consumption
  products. The possibilities of ultra heavy forms are explored in this alphabet;
  trying to solve the design problems that these sort of forms present. 'Tomate' shows
  influences from the beautiful 'Goudy Heavyface Italic' which is a design Espinoza
  admires.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.re-type.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen-tomate-1_4799.gif]"

  body: Very nice. I especially like that g which looks as if it can spin around on
    the tip of its tail.

  body: Very nice indeed. The y is indeed a bit fat. Am I the only one who thinks
    that the tail of g also might loose a tiny little weight?
