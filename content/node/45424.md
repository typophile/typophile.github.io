  importantly, have ideas for other filled-in super heavy fonts like this? I like
  the combination of the over-inflated but still geometric look. I seem to remember
  a lot of stuff like this in the old Letraset catalog and on album covers from the
  1970s.... ideas?\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/445394343_cf55249c17_3420.jpg]"
