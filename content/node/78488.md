  I can no longer find, someone posted a link to (I believe a blog post) that had
  a great description of hinting for the lay-person with very nice illustrations.
  I thought it might have been Bill Hill's site, but I can't find it there either.\r\n\r\nAnyone?"

  body: 'I would go with Tim''s in this case because the second screenshot alone shows,
    without any words, what hinting is about: providing instructions (blue/green)
    about how to distort the original outline (black) by aligning core points to the
    grid (dotted), so that the distorted outline (grey) gets rasterized well (grey
    circles).'

    Thomas. And for the additional links too Stephen."
