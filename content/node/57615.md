  would like to find some fonts that are similar to the following ones. I realized
  these are not fonts but hand-drawn lettering, but I guessed maybe you could give
  me a hand.\r\n\r\nThese come from a 1950's argentinian melodrama. The most difficult
  one is the one in which is \"Luis C\xE9sar\" is written.\r\n\r\nThank you so much
  for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I searched all the script fonts that might have been like this which I have
    collected for my Guide and really found nothing that had its blend of casual and
    formal letters. The most similar (to me) was Jason Walcott's [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000048#flont|Shirley
    Script]], and then Mark Simonson's [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000346#specimen|Lakeside]],
    which is a bit more monotone in its stroke. Neither is very close, but at least
    they have the feel of this era, and they use somewhat similar letterforms. I was
    governed most by the L and C initials, and so the D for \"Direccion\" is not too
    similar. That D style doesn't seem to go with most scripts that have a similar
    L & C.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    yet. But those types are great, so thanks!\r\n\r\nAny insight on the \"AMADORI\"
    part?\r\n\r\n\r\n - Mariano"

    to this blog... I hope you'll enjoy it just as much as I do!\r\n\r\nFYI: All movie
    posters and titles in Argentina during this period and before the early 1960's,
    they were all hand-lettered. My former father-in-law, Alfredo Faistman was one
    of the busiest hand-lettering artist working in downtown Buenos Aires ad agency
    during the late 40's and early 60's. Alfredo worked mainly in movie titles and
    posters -- I considered him a genius w/ the brush and pen. I wouldn't be surprised
    if this is one of his works.  I can contact his living wife and ask her if that's
    the case, she might remember.\r\n\r\nAlfredo was my inspiration during my early
    graphic design career, and for the love I have for typography. I met him in NY
    in the early 60's while dating his daughter. He used to work for Norcross then,
    a very famous greeting card company based in NY (similar to the Hallmark company).
    Alfredo was hand-lettering greeting cards until the early 1970s. That's when the
    greeting card industry starting to switch to photo-lettering.\r\n\r\nWhen I get
    more information about your movie title... I'll pass that information to you.\r\n\r\nsal"

    to be near Alfredo, what an inspiration.\r\nIf it helps, the movie is titled \"Dios
    se lo pague\".\r\n\r\nI'll appreciate any info on this. Thank you so much!\r\n\r\nMariano "
