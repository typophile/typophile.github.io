		<div class="commentbody">&gt;relativism is a way of thinking with doubt  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree, but I think there are much better ways to acknowledge our fallibility and the uncertainty of all our beliefs.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Popper, with whom I studied, forged a third path between the Positivists - who wanted certainty or a surrogate for it - and relativists who wanted to do away with truth as a regulative idea. His idea was that we strive through collective effort and looking at evidence to improve our grasp of reality, though it is never sure.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with the relativist way of saying that truth is relative and there is no reality is that it destroys rational argument.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my view it is quite wrong to think that relativism supports tolerance and open-mindedness. In fact, tolerance of the relativist only goes so far as he or she interacts with you. It allows for no rational discussion between people who disagree, for their two viewpoints are equally valid, and there is no reality, or evidence of reality to shed light on which is best. Argument is killed.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heidigger and his followers don't debate issues, they just pontificate.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Relativism is in fact profoundly illiberal. My mentioning Sartre and Heidigger's tolerance of totalitarean regimes was actually on point. They are greatly admired by contemporary relativists, and they illustrate that anything can be justified by relativism. Relativism seems to be humble, but in fact is a supremely arrogant philosophy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For a start, when you deny reality, you can deny the reality of the suffering of others.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Popper in fact saw the upholding of standards of rationality as key to the advancement of knowledge and to regimes that were open to listening to the people and bettering their lot. And he argued so in his famous book 'The Open Society and its Enemies', specifically against the Nazi and Communist tyranies he had seen arise during his lifetime. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A year ago I attended the Centennial celebration of Popper's birth in Vienna, and was touched by people from all over the world for whom his ideas had been a beacon of humaneness and liberalism under oppressive regimes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;it appears to me a little pretentious to say : i have the truth, it's this, or that.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree completely that to claim you are certain that you know the truth is pretentious and even ridiculous. And I never said or believed such a thing. But it is equally ridiculous to deny that there are such things as truths and reality.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And no, the first tests of reality - as I have said earlier and no one have given any counter argument - are not linguistic. A child learns the reality of objects (which yes are partly an hypothesis - a true hypothesis) before language. Animals also learn about reality of objects, other animals, food and sex without ever speaking.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Relativism is just an excuse to dismiss those you don't agree with, rather that having to look at facts, and search for the truth. It is the death of reason, and as Hogarth said, &quot;The death of reason gives birth to monsters.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

But you've always understood that's not my &quot;speciality&quot; if i have one. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About your politic example, with the wealth of URSS you missed a marxist &quot;paradigm&quot; here. For the Marx ideas to work, after what he said, the revolution need to take place in a wealth country. That wasn't really the case of the Russia, if i'm not wrong; Marx spoke, too, of an industrialised country while Russian people were mainly peasants.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And i'd be very careful with &quot;wealth&quot;. Because URSS, with all the  there was in that i can't deny, was also, thanks to the state, nearly totally alphabetised, for example. That's not nothing, especially for us i think (well, one can say too that Saddam got a unesco education prize in the end of the 70's). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem of your idea of &quot;testing&quot; is that things are more complicated. Testing one side doesn't tell any truth. It may eventually tell one particular irrelevant truth of the side tested, but that's all. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Abandoning the idea of truth don't mean abandoning the idea of search.

		<div class="commentbody">Guillaume, you can't use logic without the concept of truth. When you throw out truth, then contradictions are permitted.

The beautiful Socratic tradition is killed.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Testing doesn't tell you which theories are true, but it is a very good indication of which theories are false. It is up to us to invent better theories that are consistent with all the evidence, and then test them further. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In politics, the acknowledgement of the suffering caused or not caused by policies are very important mundane truths. Refusing to be guided by them as a reality is &quot;dangerous. Very dangerous.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have continued to comment in this thread because I dislike seeing what I view as a poison in intellectual life going unchallenged. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wanted to make clear that there is a well-developed alternative to the fashionable relativism, and to inform people that there is third side to the story - you don't have to be either a relativist or dogmatist. And that relativism may not be a benign, tolerant philosophy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, Popper did point out, as Guillaume notes, that the socialist revolution taking place first in a poor country (Russia) refutes Marx.

		<div class="commentbody">I know pretty well that contradictions are permitted. I'd say hopefully, because if not all arguing become sterile and dead. As for me, the socrate tradition is rotten. One man asks questions with the answers inside, and the poor partner only can say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;exactly&quot; or synonyms. Not fruiful, in my view. Socrate was really interesting, and beautiful in many ways, but he was also a pure dogmatist, not really interested in ideas of others, mocking of revolutionary people who wanted to discuss slavery etc. He was, also, a very fine rhetorician. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The acknolewdgement of sufferings caused by policies is, of course, important. But you really can say neither stalinism nor nazism are relativism. Because people precisely can't question anything in that systems. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And you can also search for the goods, even in the more horrible systems, 'cause there are still some. My idea is to try to think with all the complexity possible. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You obviously have to simplify to make any system, any frame of analysis. But if, after that, you don't come back to the complexity (and so on, classical dialectic), you loose many things and surely goes to something irrelevant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just wonder something : is Popper</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;The thing is that you really absoloutly want to judge. You don't want just to learn and build a living on a fruitful learning, which doesn't necessary evaluate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guillaume, the idea that you yourself don't make judgments is a mistaken idea.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You make a judgment every time to decide to eat the food rather than the plate, every time you step over a hole in the road.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You also make judgments of other people and political judgments - such as the one you made above about bad things that went on in the Soviet Union. We all make judgments, I just think it is a better idea to make them after looking at evidence and grounding them as much in reality as possible. Using logic and reason is part of being a responsibile human being. So is being open-minded enough to accept new evidence and argument and change one's mind.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The relativist's claim not to make judgments is just pretense, not reality. It shows the hollowness of the philosophy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I never said that Nazis or Communists were relativists. I said that Heidegger and Sartre used relativism to defend them. My point was that once you break loose your standards from evidence and reality, anything goes.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see from your bio here that you are a student. If you are interested you can get Popper's works in French. I think 'Conjectures and Refutations' is his best. My own book on Popper, 'Learning from Error' is in English and a German translation (Lernen aus dem Irrtum), but not in French.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;If enough people are involved, calling something a 'leg', does actually make it a leg. If the Oxford English Dictionary says it's a leg, who am I to argue?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With all due respect, Matha, you miss the point of Lincoln's story: changing language doesn't change reality. The fixing of meaning is conventional - the sound 'he' refers to a man in English and to a woman in Hebrew. But once the meanings are relatively fixed in a language community, then sentences refer to reality, and are true or false. The reality doesn't change even though we may get it wrong or fail to understand it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example once 'weapons of mass destruction' is given a clear meaning, the claim that they were in Iraq gets meaning, and the reality of whether they were there or not doesn't change no matter what George Bush or Hans Blix says. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The idea that language determines reality is such a crock. Eating keeps us alive, sex makes babies - and you don't need talk when you are doing either one!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;William, I see your point, but I guess we must have  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->different tresholds, no offense. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yves, no offense given or taken. I noted the rudeness because don't think it should be accepted as a normal course of action, on these boards or anywhere else.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;instead of taking advice <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, I recently accepted 100% of your typographic advice on my book project, and thanked you for your kindness.

		<div class="commentbody">William, i obviously make judgements everytime. And of course, when the question is important, logic and reason are my better friends (well, let say apart about love). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But i try to avoid them as much as i can when they're not needed. And, all the more, i try not to make judgements systematically. If something is pure occidental, it's that frenetic need to eveluate, to give labels. I am myself pushed to do that, as it's a main point of our culture, but i try as much as i can not to do so if the situation don't call for a judgement. Just a free look. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About it as a phylosophy, you know, a philosophy hasn't to be taken litteraly for living. Maybe i just have, as i want it, to try to do it more often. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For now i really haven't time to read anything else than what i already have to, but when i'll have such time, i'll try to get a look on your master. I think my reading of Leo Strauss make me a quite honest idea of your position ? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About language. Of course it doesn't determine reality itself. But it sure determines the way we see it, and so the way we analyse it, because we simply haven't any other way to think. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I disagree strongly that WMD has a clear sense. Planes driven by fanatic people are now supposed to be so. If any unexpected use of something potentially dangerous on a big scale, it would be added on the list. So it's not that clear. I'm just studying that for my work, so it's not a so easy question. And here, particuliarly, what Bush says change many things because he can say &quot;they are there&quot; without being sure</div>

		<div class="commentbody">About the leg and the tail: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matha, yes we can start calling a dog's tail a leg, and if we establish the convention it might stick. But most people want language to be useful &ndash; not perfect, not all revealing and encompassing &ndash; just useful for talking about the reality around them. Calling a dog's tail a leg doesn't change the nature of the thing attached to a dog's arse. It remains pysically different from the other things we call leg. So by calling tails legs we've just made language less useful because we've removed the linguistic distinction between things that are distinct in reality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, and this is quite interesting, language reflects cultural priorities insofar as language embodies classification. The distinction between tail and leg is one of classification, and the fact that we have two separate words for them indicates that we consider the classification to be important. It is conceivable that there is another culture that would have a single word for 'long skinny things attached to the body of a dog', which would be used for both legs and tails. Such a word would indicate that this culture has never considered the physical or functional differences between legs and tails to be important: they have different priorities in classification. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So language reflects priority in the classification of reality, but it does not affect the nature of that which is classified: the physical and functional distinctions between legs and tails persist whether a language defines the distinctions or not. Calling a tail a leg does not change the dog, only the language.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Where i disagree with you, Joseph, is when you say that intention and language are two different things. The language isn't a pure system, to take out of context. The context is part of the language. The system is virtually pure, but everytime it's used, it become a more complex (and confusing) thing, made of phonems, letters, significations, voice, attitude etc. You can't separate the different elements that are a whole thing once it's used. WMD can be a specific range of real weapons, described by specific attributes; but it can be anything enough powerful to make a big damage.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if a &quot;leg&quot; seems clearly refer to one specific thing, the majority of the language depend on many factors for its sense to be clear.

Of course words can have multiple meanings, and the clearer you want to be about your meaning the more words you need to use to clarify how you are using specific phrases. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, one word = anything is also irrelevant, and not only that it is dangerous. We can and should, for example, demand a specific definition of 'weapons of mass destruction' from our political leaders, and they can and should provide such a definition: it is possible to state what they mean, even if it isn't in their interests to do so. The vagueness isn't in the language, it is in the intention not to use language clearly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Between the vain idea of a perfect language, in which there is a one-to-one natural correspondence of word and thing, and the vain idea of total deconstruction of meaning in which there is no correspondence of word and thing other than a momentary and individual interpretive one, there is the linguistic world that most people operate in on a daily basis. There are conventional correspondences between words and things embodied in usage, and these can be explained and understood in terms of a matrix of such correspondences. So when I say 'This is a duck', I can go on to explain what a bird is, what distinguishes this duck bird from other birds, and can relate all these concepts to physical specimens. There is no one-to-one natural correspondence between the word duck and the thing duck, not least because there are different breeds of duck and the word duck is also a verb that has nothing to do with water fowl, but we have adequate functionality of language in talking about the thing we call a duck. If the functionality wasn't adequate, we would make it adequate by devising new ways of talking about the thing, which is something at which we are very adapt. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As an aside, the fact that you call me Joseph does not make me Joseph <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

For example, we are closer to understanding the truth about the nature of the moon than people were a thousand years ago. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Having already tried the patience of those not interested in philosophy, I am reluctant to go further in this thread. My article 'Skeptical Rationalism' (Inquiry, 22, p. 281-230) lays out my own views in depth.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The main question I would have for Matha and Guillaume is: What is gained by being a relativist? If you think the answer is a more tolerant point of view, I think you are making a serious mistake - though one that has nothing to do with type!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Unless you consider Matha's original comment to be completely unrelated to the preceding discussion, I'm not sure that the talk has gone as far off topic as you think Hrant. Maybe it has not gone where you hoped it would go, but I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities to follow your line of enquiry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think William should be cowed by your accusations of abusing the forum, and whenever you claim to be insulted I somehow find it hard to credit, knowing how thick you claim your skin to be.

I can see that you truly believe in science (which is fine by me) but I wonder how repeatable such scientific observations would be if the number of people tested was increased to something really really enormous. A test involving millions or billions is obviously outside the scope of any scientific study but would most likely reveal patterns far less repeatable than in anything done so far. The relatively small scale of scientific studies like this hides more than it reveals. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I recently read that in a worldwide study, women were discovered to be better than men at reading in 100% of partcipating countries.

		<div class="commentbody">Matha, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have heard people say they found Popper's intellectual autobiography, 'The Unended Quest' a good place to start. You will know from it pretty quickly whether you want to go further. 'Conjectures and Refutations' contains some of his best, and most accessible essays. There is also a very good anthology, in England called 'A Pocket Popper', edited by David Miller. I would start with one of the essays in 'Conjectures' or the 'Unended Quest', though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'The Logic of Scientific Discovery' and 'The Open Society and Its Enemies' are Popper's major works, but I wouldn't start with them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For secondary material on Popper, on philosophy of science, I think my book with John Wettersten, 'Learning from Error' can be helpful: It puts Popper into the tradition of the tradition of cognitive psychology, which makes it much easier to understand what he is up to. (It is out of print but you can get it in University libraries.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On politics and the social sciences, the recent book by Malachi Hacohen 'Karl Popper: The Formative Years' is very revealing about the political background of Poppers work.</div>
