body: "I'd like to know the background from the typefaces used in (hand engraved)
  music scores.  I have looked at the text faces for  setting titles, lyrics, tempi
  and dynamics.  Music symbols is another interesting subject, since there is a great
  decline in typographical standards when comparing computer scores to traditional
  scores.  There is no digital music symbol font that I know of that has attention
  to all the details that you would find in an engraved score.\r\n\r\nFortunately
  I have a large library of musical scores, most of which are still hand engraved
  (from dover publications, many edition peters, etc...).  Since music engraving had
  reached most of it's form in the 19th century, I found that the typefaces used were
  mostly modern (neo-classical).  Titles are mostly modern (display) faces, but other
  faces, including slab serif are also used.  For lyrics also the modern face was
  often used, but not exclusively.  I've found that tempo markings are exclusively
  set in bold modern, and dynamics in italic modern.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked through
  \"typefaces for books\", I found that the font the resembles these the most are
  modern scotch, rather than the bodoni and didot.  The italics look rounder and also
  the roman t ends in an upwards shape.  I have many books, reprinted from old editions
  that use this font (Forsyth Orchestration, Harry Olson music physics and engineering,
  Raleigh the theory of sound).  Also Donald Knuth's Computer Modern Roman was based
  on this design.\r\n\r\nI would like to know what is the history behind these faces.
  \ \"Typefaces for books\" describes the design as \"late transitional\", rather
  than modern, although they are mostly described as modern.  They do not seem to
  be based on Didot or Bodoni."

    recruitment Group</a>  I must say that sharing your thoughts with one another
    is an easy way to relax yourself in the daily hectic routines. Each time a description
    of the change, there are always lots of talk about it anywhere.  <a href="http://candorrecruitmentgroup.wordpress.com/">Employment
    Provider Group</a>  These are not exempt. I mean one must be up to date with the
    day to day change in the environment and in the technology as well.  <a href="http://www.candorrecruitmentgroup.blogspot.com/">Recruitment

  body: Traditionally, the indications like "piano", "allegro", etc. use some kind
    of late neo-classical design in italics, like Monotype Modern for example. But,
    as you say, these were mostly engraved (or lithographed), so these are not typefaces
    <cite>per se</cite>.

  body: If they are engraved, wouldn't they be called <em>typefaces</em>?  Still I
    have found similar typefaces in many other books, they seem quite standard for
    the time.  These <em>italic</em> typefaces very much resemble the early scotch
    modern type, for example the italic fonts made by William Miller (according to
    [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.be/2007/02/scotch-roman.html|this article]]).  Does
    that mean that these <em>late neo-classical</em> fonts are based on the english
    modern type?  Also, has William Miller invented the fonts, or based the design
    on predecessors?

  body: "In the 20th century, a lot of commercial scores of popular music simply had
    the lyrics typed in - using an IBM Executive typewriter, so that they would almost
    look printed - usually with the Documentary typestyle.\r\n\r\nIt was a cheap way
    to do what would have been very expensive to do with conventional typography,
    to align each syllable below the appropriate note, and it was well-suited to offset
    lithograpy.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure somebody would also have used the Vari-Typer
    for this (although the chief musical use I remember is the round paper stickers
    in the middle of LPs) as well. And no doubt others splurged on a Selectric Composer.
    But the Executive was very widespread."

  body: "You can definitely call these engraved (or lithographed) <cite>lettering</cite>
    based on typefaces designs. Richard Austin cut the punches for the types sold
    by the Miller typefoundry in Glasgow \u2014 his designs owe something to those
    of Baskerville, and are typical of a very specific brand of British neo-classical
    type style, less severe than the continental one (Didot, Bodoni, Walbaum). See
    also related designs such as Bell or Bulmer."

  body: "Thanks, I didn't know about the vari-typer!  But since this is a 20th century
    invention, 19th century engravers still had to punch each letter, right?  What
    about henle, who did metal plate engraving until the 90's?\r\n\r\nRegarding Baskerville,
    Bell, etc, the italic does look mostly like the scotch modern italic, with exceptions:
    for example the lowercase p has a rounded tail in scotch modern.  That's how it's
    in most scores, even early ones (from 1830)."
