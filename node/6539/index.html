  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;I really could use some help &ndash; I'm having problems with a font I bought earlier today, and I've run out of ideas. <BR> <BR>The font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/wade-vernacular/">Wade Vernacular</a>. It comes as a set of  four versions (solid, shadowed, shaded, outline). I bought it as Windows TT, even though what I really needed it for was a project I'm doing on my Mac (the fabled zine), because Win TT is supposed to work under OSX, and I haven't had any problems doing that in the past, and I wanted to be able to use it on my Windows computer (e.g. it has a better printer). <BR> <BR>Three of the four versions are working just fine (solid, shadowed, shaded). The fourth, Wade V. Outline, is doing some really bizarre stuff in my Adobe programs. It works fine in everything except InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. This is what it looks like: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48254.gif" alt="Outline big"> <BR>This is what is should look like: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48255.gif" alt="Outline textedit"> <BR>For comparison, the other versions, which look fine: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48256.gif" alt="Solidshaded"> <BR> <BR>Even more bizarre than the first image shows, the distortions change as you change the point size. For example: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48257.gif" alt="Hs"> <BR> <BR>I've tried resinstalling, converting the problem font from Win TT to Mac TT with a Mac program (TTConverter), with a PC program (CrossFont), and rebooting, with no luck. And this version (outline) was most of the reason I bought this font instead of some other slab serif. <BR> <BR>Anyone seen anything like this before?&lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, so MyFonts just offered to switch me to a Mac PS version. I think I just assumed, really for no reason, that they'd be meanies and say &quot;That's what you get for buying the wrong format.&quot; <BR> <BR>Thomas, I tried it in Word (v. X) and it's doing the same thing there. So if it's a bug, it probably isn't an Adobe-specific one. And I also just discovered that the distortion doesn't show up in PDFs exported from Indy. Go figure. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestion Stephen, sorry if I seemed a little panic-stricken everyone <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The designer was kind enough to send me a copy of the font, and I couldn't find anything wrong with it (other than the exclamation mark being in the slot for the space character, but that's another issue). Path winding order looks good. There are a few unnecessary control points, but nothing terrifying. <BR> <BR>My best guess is that FontLab's TT auto-hinting is messing things up a bit. I would hardly even blame it; an outline this complex is *really* poorly suited to TT auto-hinting. But who'd want to manually hint something like this, either? If I needed a TT version, I'd be tempted to leave it completely unhinted. But that's just me. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Huh. Well, I regenerated the font two different ways from FontLab 4.6.0 (Win). Once with hinting, and once with hinting suppressed. NEITHER version shows the problem. The developer says the TT was originally generated from FontLab in the first place, so color me confused. <BR> <BR>Seeing as it's not a problem specific to our rendering, it's easily fixable, and how it got messed up is not obvious, I'm giving up on this one for now. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>
