  body: "Life go's on, the \"Real\" design world was here before Pierre Mendell and
    as we all know it will be here after everyone dies.  Learning from the master
    has always been influenced by others (professors).  Bad design comes from those
    who lack the knowledge of the basic fundamentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrizmo+Design"
