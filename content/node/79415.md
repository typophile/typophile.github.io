  is a latin and arabic type family designed by <strong>Titus Nemeth</strong>. Her
  origin is the Maghreb but she was brought up in Europe, she speaks many languages
  and is equally at home in the banlieu of Paris as in the Medina of Marrakesh. Aisha's
  features show clearly where she is coming from, and her confidence lets her stand
  out among the crowd. She is a playful character, sometimes  even a little cheeky,
  for she knows about her qualities. The little skip in her step, cheerful and fun,
  the twists and turns and the sparkle in her eye are all carefully controlled \u2013
  Aisha does not lose control or get carried away. Her looks are gentle and friendly,
  and certainly one cannot confuse her with anything else. Aisha is not ashamed of
  her quirks, her pace, her surprises and expresses her moods through extra bold type.\r\n
  \r\nAisha originates from research about the Maghribi script, its regular Arabic
  weight is based on foundry type Titus discovered in a 19th century book. During
  its design Titus reinterpreted the sources within the frame given by current usage
  and technology. He developed a Latin face to accompany the Arabic, drawing both
  as independently usable, yet closely related typefaces. The Latin version of Aisha
  is one of the very rare designs in which style and feel of the Arabic version shaped
  the direction of the Roman letters, rather than the commonly found inverse direction.\r\n
  \r\nTo expand its versatility and usability, a range of weights covering both scripts
  was conceived. Drawing on research about Maghribi calligraphy and inspired by expressive
  Moroccan lettering, the resulting designs feature generous curves, joyful variations
  and much colour, rendering Aisha a historically informed typeface for contemporary
  requirements.\r\n \r\nIn her young career, Aisha has already received much praise.
  She was awarded the <strong>\u2018Certificate of Excellence in Type Design\u2019
  at the TDC\xB2 2010</strong>, and  nominated for the prestigious <strong>2011 \u2018Design
  Award of the Federal Republic of Germany\u2019</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\nmore info: http://www.rosettatype.com/Aisha\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aisha_slide_1_3577.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aisha_slide_w_4307.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aisha_slide_4_6180.png]"

    and recent political events in arab countries, I'm feeling a bit more optimistic
    about the world (singular)."
