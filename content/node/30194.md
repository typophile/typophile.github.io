  Reader</A> readers may be interested in type on Wii, the device boasts web browsing
  functionality so type is used for more than the product UI. There's a gallery of
  images here... \r\n\r\nhttp://www.engadget.com/2006/12/22/wii-browser-hands-on/
  \r\n\r\nDifficult to tell too much, except that the browser font seems to be the
  standard Wii UI font (note the quirky e) and that it doesn't seem to hold up too
  well at small sizes (well this is on a TV of course) - also can't tell if the bold
  and italic is true or faked. But still the shots are worth checking out and I'm
  sure better ones will be posted sooner or later. \r\n\r\nEnjoy, Si"

  body: If anyone wants to come over and dissect the type on the Nintendo Wii over
    the holidays, mine is sitting around glowing blue. But I only have Wii Sports
    to play, because it was a gift and I'm too broke to buy games. Hell, I might have
    to get an internship next semester just to make use of an x-mas gift!

  body: "So here's my review of type on the Wii browser: it sucks. This isn't so much
    a problem with the Wii as it is with the browser, which really isn't even finished
    enough to be called a beta. The zoom functionality needed to make type readable
    doesn't actually work, so it's pretty much useless. \r\n\r\nIt does, however,
    have the ability to render a lot of flash content, including Typophile.com. This
    could be a killer app for the Wii; if Google just adds a Wii Youtube portal we
    can sit on the couch and watch videos."

  body: "Speaking of type on screen, for xmas I got a Pentax digital camera. I had
    wanted a new digital camera that didn't take proprietary batteries (as i was getting
    sick of buying those) and, apparently, Pentax is one of the few companies making
    cameras that take regular batteries (according to the store clerk, at least).\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    the camera seems nice enough but will likely have to return it simply because
    I can not stand the on-screen typography and iconography. I can usually tolerate
    bad UI as long as the product works, but the Pentax UI just really bugs me for
    some reason.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll trade it for a WII. ;o)\r\n\r\nInteresting that
    the WII is using Opera. Nice to see that!\r\n\r\nsii...in case you missed it,
