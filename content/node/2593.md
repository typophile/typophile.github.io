  body: 'Daniel: There are a lot of things I like about this font. My first reaction
    was that it would make an interesting mono spaced font. The characters are very
    boxy, and have the appearance of being modular. <BR> <BR>Overall, very nice. Things
    I would tweak: 1&#41; the letter &#34;e&#34; seems awkward. It appears as if it
    could fall forward at any second. 2&#41; the &#34;W&#34; seems too wide. 3&#41;
    the tail on the &#34;y&#34; doesn&#39;t thrill me. 4&#41; certain letters look
    &#34;weightier&#34; than others...although that could just be the screen. '

  body: 'This is a bit trendy, but attractive nonetheless. <BR> <BR>Some things: <BR>-
    The caps are too big. <BR>- The vertical proportions of the lc are good. <BR>-
    I&#39;d give the &#34;e&#34; a smaller eye. <BR>- The dots of &#34;i&#34;/&#34;j&#34;
    are too small &#40;and too low&#41;. <BR>- I think the &#34;k&#34; could be more
    interesting. <BR>- I&#39;d make the &#34;t&#34; wider. <BR>- The &#34;B&#34; is
    a bit wide. <BR>- I&#39;d give the &#34;I&#34; serifs. <BR>- The &#34;K&#34; is
    imbalanced. <BR>- The &#34;P&#34; seems to have a funny appendage... ;-&#41; <BR>-
    The &#34;Q&#34; needs a stronger tail. <BR>- Yes, there seems to be a lot of weight
    imbalance. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Thank you guys, that are some very good hints. I also think that the caps
    are too big and too strong. At the moment they are as high as the ascenders of
    the LC. I&#39;ll fix that. I&#39;m not sure about the &#34;e&#34; i like as it
    is, but i try out what you suggested. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post a new image when
    its done, but feel free to post more suggestions. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: 'Hi everybody, <BR> <BR>in the summer of 2003 after months of construction
    and kearning i finished my typefamily &#34;Nuri&#34; which became a huge sucess
    and was published in a few int. webzines and the german &#34;page&#34; magazine.
    Here Daniel G&uuml;nther saw my type and even voted it in this forum for the best
    new typefaces of 2003: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22342.html"

    <BR> The more i was suprised reading this thread about a new type designed by
    Daniel G&uuml;nther which he acclaims to be his idea of a new sans serif. For
    my eyes its just a copy cat example par exellence. Sure, there are a few modifications
    but the overall idea is fully copied. <BR> <BR>Why is somebody wasting his time
    instead of  working on his own originality and ideas for stuff like that? Maybe
    somebody here has the answer. But most of all <BR>i'

  body: 'Frank: Point well taken. Although, to assume that we are somehow culpable
    by helping Daniel refine the font is a bit of a stretch. I believe this is the
    first time that I have even seen your font in any great detail. So it wouldn&#39;t
    occur to me that this font was not original. <BR> <BR>That being said, the similarities
    to Nuri are undeniable. I believe you have a valid argument.'

  body: Hi Daniel. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want to make any assumptions about your intentions
    or goals for this project. I&#39;ve often said to <BR>myself, &#34;Wow! What a
    font! I wonder if I could make something similar.&#34; That&#39;s ok as a learning
    <BR>experience. Extremely valuable in fact. One suggestion you might take from
    this is to disclose your <BR>intent and any sources when you introduce the project.
    Not only does it save Frank the hernia, but we <BR>can also better critique and
    assist you. <BR> <BR>Stick around at Typophile. You are obviously a lover of type,
    and more than welcome. Chalk this one <BR>up to experience. I look forward to
    seeing your next contribution to the critique section. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: Frank, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s close enough. For one thing, I think there
    are other fonts closer to yours than they &#40;or yours&#41; are close to Ela!
    <BR> <BR>On the other hand, if your stuff was indeed his inspiration, he should
    state that clearly. Inspiration is an invaluable catalyst that shouldn&#39;t be
    muzzled, but credit it important too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    opinion here. I received a very bad eMail from him last week in which he blamed
    me for copying his Nuri and threatend me with his lawyer if i would publish the
    font. I think that is bit overreacted, what do you think? <BR> <BR>I can
