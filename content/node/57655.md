body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI created logo for dentist Dr. Meurer & Dr. Palazis. What do
  you think about the way, form and the main solution. The brief is small and simply:
  the identity have to be strong, clear and not cheap, Bulgary under dentists :) So
  I created something where the phylosophy hide in the letters... the sign consists
  both with \"p\" and \"m\" and build together the form of tooth."

    too. Good work :)

  body: "The first aid cross in the center has a weird thinness to it, that brings
    too much attention to it. I would try and beef it up a bit, which might require
    shrinking it's overall size to accommodate for it's new heftiness. \r\n\r\nUnless,
    you'd rather use a lighter weight for the text... this would make the logo \"pm\"
    pop more, creating a different contrast.\r\n\r\n-Andrew"

  body: 'Hi, I think the mark is great and the type too, the only thing I''d work
    on is the ratio between the mark and the type. The mark seems to be about the
    half of what I think it should be. '

  body: 'It''s clever, and I don''t really see the religious part: it''s not a Latin
    (i.e., Christian) cross. In my opinion, crosses like the one seen in the logo
    are usually taken as a secular symbol for medicine, except with some fundamentalists,
    which is why the Red Crescent was apparently created.'

  body: "Not getting any religious references, but I think the mark is not exactly
    spot on. I get a Duracell reference (as in \"the plus end of the battery\") and
    the House of Knives reference (as in \"the Swiss Army knives\"). More of the latter,
    because of the sharp edges and, obviously, the Swiss Cross in the middle. \r\n\r\nAlso
    having something <em>in</em> the tooth evokes rather unpleasant association of
    that insert being extracted from there by dentists, i.e. cavities and all that.\r\n"

  body: I like the mark, definitely a good concept in my opinion. However, I would
    lose the cross altogether and just have the M and P tooth symbol.

  body: "I think you can live without the cross. Great mark though. Very iconic. You
    did a great job of incorporating the tooth, m, and p without losing the iconic
    value of the design. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\nNeed
