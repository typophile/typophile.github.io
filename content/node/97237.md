    as \"Caslon\" in the old FontBank collection. The site that carried these is gone,
    apparently, or I would have pointed to the font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "As usual, thanks for the feedback Mike. I was quite confused because I firstly
    thought about some Caslon, found one \"Caslon Regular\"(??!!) on and old Xara
    CD, which looks like quite matching. But, as I was unable to find any valid source
    for this font, I continued searching and finally found this Horsham.\r\nZekeman,
    would you please tell me what are the differences you can see between your sample
    and Horsham Heavy as I clearly don't see any (probably my eyes)?"

  body: "I think Xara took over the BuyFonts site where the FontBank fonts were available.
    I have the FontBank collection with \"Caslon\" (font #100). The image I have attached
    was made using it. The upper image was the posted sample.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/richsafident_Caslon_5766.gif]\r\n\r\n-
