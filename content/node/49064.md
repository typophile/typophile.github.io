body: I came across this typeface while visiting my fathers farm this summer, and
  was struck by this typeface I found on the wall in his workshop. The lettering originally
  belonged to a very old tractor, most likely from the 1940's. I was just wondering
  whether or not it is an actual typeface or just a hand-lettered logotype. Thank
  you for your help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KINGtype2_3678.jpg]

  body: That looks like a custom job, by someone who didn't know the optical trick
    to get the G to look the same height as the KIN. Some of the traditional sign
    painter sans at [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/thick&thin.shtml|Letterhead
    Fonts]] are close but would need careful squooshing.
