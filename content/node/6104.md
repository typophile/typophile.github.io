body: First of all I want to say that reading some of the threads in this section
  blew my mind. I almost would like to see a TV Contest Show between you guys &#40;where
  you could actually win some money from your expertise, for once <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#41;. <BR> <BR>Second, the problem in hand. Every time
  I watch on TV images from the press conferences from The WH or The Pentagon the
  &#34;logos&#34; look wobbly to me, as if the letter ar not well aligned &#40;horizontally
  AND vertically&#41;. I wonder if that&#39;s an illusion or what? If you could also
  tell me the name of the font it&#39;d be great. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42926.jpg"

  body: I think all these oval background placards that the federal government uses
    are set in, or at least inspired by, some variety of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/goudy/old-style/testdrive.html?s=WHITE%2BHOUSE&amp;p=48">Goudy
    Old Style</a>, but some of the glyphs, like the &#34;A&#34; and the &#34;S&#34;,
    look more compressed. It was probably custom designed based on Goudy Old Style
    &#40;who knows, maybe they even commissioned Goudy to do it himself....&#41;
