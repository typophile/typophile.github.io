body: "So I'm new to FontStruct. I think it's sort of complicated, but it's not as
  complicated as creating a whole font from scratch.\r\n\r\nWhen I sit down to create
  a font, I get some kind of creative overload, block, thing. I think that this will
  be easy, but then I have all these worries. What if the font looks too much like
  all the ones I've seen? What if everyone thinks it's horrible? How do I even get
  started on this thing? It's all so stressful to me.\r\n\r\nI can say this. My most
  favorite fonts are sans serif. I like them to be clean with very little flair. That's
  about it.\r\n\r\nAny advice is more than welcome.\r\nJ"

    that your early work will be awful and unoriginal. Free yourself to focus on learning.
    Then, after you get the hang of it, worry about making something good."

  body: "I agree with James. My first attempts were awful. But they gave me practice,
    and an opportunity to make mistakes.\r\n\r\nFontStruct is certainly helpful, in
    that it provides a grid and building blocks. But you could sit down with notebook
    and pencil and sketch out your ideas first. (Many designers sketch out a few representative
    characters, like H and O, but you can start wherever you like: A, N, E... etc.)\r\n\r\nYou'll
    find some how-to advice here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13083\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://briem.net/\">Briem's site</a> is very helpful.\r\n\r\nSo is <a href=\"http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\">Underware's

  body: "In terms of method, designing a typeface with FontStruct is not very different
    from designing with other font editors.\r\n\r\nI normally start by designing the
    most \"influential\" letters first: n o H O (to define the main proportions and
    rhythm) and a e g s (to define the font's personality). Once you find a comfortable
    resolution to build these glyphs in your design, the rest follows naturally. :-)\r\n\r\nMaking
    your FontStruction public for other users to comment is also a great way to get
    feedback and improve your design.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps // see you on FontStruct!"

    about the letters to start with. I guess it's a lot better than starting with
    A, then B, etc.\r\nJ"
