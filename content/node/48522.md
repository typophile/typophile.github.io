  a make a text family from this, but the idea is to make a typographic companion
  for my previous font Orbe http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/orbe.asp\r\n\r\nI would
  love to have your opinion on this. thanks in advanced.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spec_4953.jpg]"

  body: "That's quite lovely. I love the ampersand, and the alternate v, w, and y.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, the only character that looks a little odd is the 3. It seems unbalanced without
    the ball serif on the top."

  body: "Rui,\r\n\r\nThis is a really nice one!. Just a few things that \"pop out\"
    from the overall good flow and rhythm of this typeface.\r\n\r\nI agree on the
    comment made for the number 3. The ampersand is great but more as a alternate
    rather that a regular ampersand to me. The Euro sign could also have thin \"ball
    serifs\" like the other currency signs. The upper case R is also to \"alternate\"
    for me.\r\nApart form that I like what I see. Gives me a sort of a \"funky Bodoni\"
    feeling. Good luck with the finalisation of your typeface.\r\n\r\nPS. The posters
    for TypeCon 2008, that Peter Bruhn made with your typeface on the front page made
    a success!"

  body: "yes, I agree the 3 is unbalanced and maybe the 2 as well. I have to fix these.\r\nAbout
    the exuberances still present here, like the upper case R, I still have to make
    more \"quiet\" glyphs and have letters like the \"R\", \"g\" and Ampersand as
    alternatives. I'll show more soon.\r\n\r\nStefan, Peter's poster was also very
    nice."

  body: "Very nice! I agree that tamer versions of R, g, &, etc, might make it more
    useful. Where's 9? Old-style numerals would also be a nice addition, and you could
    make them a bit more eccentric. The contrast is fantastic.\r\n\r\nOh, also, is
    \u0152 supposed to be shorter?"
