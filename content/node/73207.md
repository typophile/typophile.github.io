  I read a book set with (on/in?) Melior. And that was agony: glyph cotrast was way
  too high, and that squarish design did not help. So, I promptly went to work with
  a more legible replacement, and came up with utterly different font with nothing
  to do with Melior whatsoever:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tow_5183.png]\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n"

  body: I think the o, e and c are to wide, the lower bowl of the g to small and the
    w to dark/condensed. Also I agree with eliason that it needs some wider spacing.
    I like the look of it, but it just doesn't seem balanced yet.

  body: 'I also agree that the o seems too wide or the a too condensed. It''s seems
    there is two kind of typeface here, a condensed and a normal one. I think you
    should choose one of that two style. The italic is more interesting to me but
    the v, w are too extended. Take a look at you bdpq, at the join with the stem,
    I think it''s too large. Keep going. '

  body: "Andr\xE9, you are right, those are too wide and too narrow. And you're right
    on italics as well. Will keep on going.\r\n\r\nCraig, my fonts are made mostly
    for display, and they are usually used in large point sizes. Therefore I make
    my fonts for use in 24+ size.\r\n\r\nIt also makes better letter spacing in general:
    one can always track out the type, but many fonts can't handle the negative tracking.
    My fonts can.\r\n\r\nAnd Philips (1996type), you've just started type design,
    so perhaps you should take it easy with your comments for some time. I've seen
    your work.\r\n\r\nAnd here's a sample of my latest tight spacing with some 1 200
    hand-made kerning pairs:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tart_5471.png]\r\n(I
    changed the weight from Black to Heavy, to avoid any U.S. comments, and just now
    realized the irony.)"
