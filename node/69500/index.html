  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I wonder if someone can help me with a "noob" question. This is probably something that is being taught on a second week of a proper type design class... which I fully intend to attend at some point later on :)

I am trying to understand the reason for the lower curve of the a's tail not following the geometrically obvious path:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_5249.png]

My guess is that it has to do with the visual balance. The notch is deepened to cut away some of the black and improve the uniformity of perceived stroke thickness in that area. Am I off?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Strokes are generally thinned at oblique intersections.
Otherwise, the joint becomes enlarged, and ends up looking bigger than it really is, due to "bleed"
Bleed is of several kinds. 

Firstly, it is a traditional artefact of print typography, because these sharp crevasses are apt to fill in with ink.
Hence the preemptive move of thinning the stroke(s), and even taking it further and enlarging the pit as an "ink trap".

Secondly, there is a visual bleed in the perceptual process, because the apex of the joint is beyond the threshold of acuity.

Thirdly there is categorical or conceptual bleed, which is further up the perceptual chain; this occurs because at a joint there is a wider distance of solid than either of the stroke widths that comprise it, and this does not appear to be aligned with either stroke-- it "reads" as a blot or hot spot, visual noise which serves no purpose. 

That third kind is more what happens at the bottom of the "a".

Letter forms also suffer shrinkage as well as bleed, at the outside of corners.
Or perhaps that could be described as a kind of "negative" bleed, of the surrounding ground into the figure.
The serif is the most obvious method of dealing with shrinkage, but in phototypography, "ticks" were sometimes added to corners to prevent the arris from becoming rounded. Even in a sans, the end of a stroke is often widened and sharpened, as at the top left of the "a" above, to counteract shrinkage. </div>

This sentence gotta have more information per bit of storage that a jpeg file :)

@William - very useful link, thank you. I knew some of the items on Briem's list, but I really like how his way of summarizing them.

@James - can you elaborate? I don't even know what to start squinting at.

@Craig - it would still imply some sort of simple geometrical relation between the curves, the one that is not there :)</div>

I know you weren’t asking me, but the problems are unsightly bulges and bad relationships between the two sides of the strokes that create an overall lack of continuity. That <strong>a</strong> looks more like a collection of digital curves bolted together than a series of continuous strokes.</div>

Maybe picture that's a race course you're driving on. Dunno, but I'd be spilling some of my coffee somewhere in the top-left and bottom-left of that, too.

But it can't all be smooth with a curvature capped at some safe value, can it? Though I think I see what you mean regarding the bottom left. Is this better? -

No. It is not about "safe" it is about flow, harmony and tension.


Besides those highlighted already, there is another unsightly curve at the 7:30 position as well.</div>
