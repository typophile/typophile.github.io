  I do not have to find of answers to the questions that I settle(arise), that's why
  I allows me to open a new subject.\r\nI am student in visual communication and within
  the framework of the lesson of typography we have to realize a book presenting a
  font. I take charge of Dogma drawn by Zuzana Licko.\r\nI do not manage to find examples
  of use of this typography.\r\nHave already crossed it in advertisements, visual
  identity, post ..... ?\r\n\r\nplease help me !"

    there.\r\n\r\nalso, you can check any logo book and probably see a few Dogma Scripts
    in there.\r\n\r\ninteresting that the movie Dogma uses Barnbrook's Exocet, also
    from Emigre.\r\n(the version below is slightly modified, though there are also
    unmodified versions on the web)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dogmaa70-1801_4349.jpg]"
