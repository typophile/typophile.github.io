  body: I've just tried it. I used it in the past. Perhaps it's not right because
    of the "quotation marks"! If you can help me again... thanks a lot!

    as i see. i may have the wrong weight (don't have others available, sorry)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snap_5570.png]"

  body: "no idea. may have been installed with an application somewhere along the
    line. if I was using my work mac, i'd say the adobe version OTF. but this is my
    personal machine and i don't have access to the fancy stuff here.\r\n\r\nedit
    - if you meant what weight, i think this was a medium that i falsely bolded in
    a text editor."

  body: "well, judging solely by your image i'd start with Demi. the adobe version
    seems a bit heavier than Linotype\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snap_6615.png]\r\n\r\nthe
    subtext may be another weight and there's always the chance it's been stretched,
    spaced, etc. experimentation is your friend."

  body: I meant "Eurostile Extended" or "Eurostile Condensed" or "Eurostile Demi"
    or something else. Any ideas? But you should have been using a simple "Eurostile"...

    what application you are using, i can only suggest the following:\r\n\r\n\u201C
    = option+[\r\n\u201D = option+shift+[\r\n\r\n"

  body: My " quotation marks" doesn't appear like yours! I really don't know why.
    In advance again, thanks a lot for your precious words!
