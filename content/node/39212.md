  body: "The G is the hardest part to match, but if you made the G from a C with about
    the right closure, all you need to find is a sans with a low crossbar on the A.
    I thought of House's Neutraface, but if you don't want to make that kind of investment,
    you could work with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-706/\">Neuzeit
    Grotesk (Geometric 706)</a> and use a small amount of added white stroke to thin
    the strokes like your sample.\r\n\r\nThis is assuming you only want to do a limited
    amount of lettering this way.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "wow mike, neutra looks great. actually i'm using it as an inspiration for
    a logotype, so i'll probably not buy a font for it, so thank you for the workaround
    as well ;-)\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ncurtze"
