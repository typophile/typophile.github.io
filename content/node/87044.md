  I asked if we could purchase Winthorpe, but I guess funding is limited.  \r\n\r\nDo
  you know of any free (or super, super cheap) alternatives?  I may purchase with
  my own money if only a few dollars, but I'm pretty limited myself.  I am already
  using Diploma font (which is okay), but for one section, it'd be nice to have a
  font like Winthorpe or Harvard.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas?  My email is joel AT joeljupp
  dot com\r\n\r\nThanks, guys.  I'm brand new here, and this site looks awesome.  I
  am pumped!!\r\n "
