  body: Sans Medium looks derivated from Fine Regular. Spirequal is in the same vein
    as Fenice but far from being similar. Quilline and Maximum Line don't remind me
    of anything.

  body: "<blockquote>Where is Sans Fine? You don't mean Fine Regular, do you?</blockquote>\r\nYes\r\n<blockquote>Because
    to me they're totally different.</blockquote>\r\nTo me, they look to share the
    same backbone. Take Fine Regular and embolden the all thing, close open letters,
    reworks stems and spurs and you'd be very close. It's easy to see it when opening
    them in 2 different tabs and switching from one to the other (even /Q tail is
    identical)."

  body: Thanks for the suggestions, im not sure what this snowballed into but i'm
    glad it started a conversation. I have to say I would not give an ID credit to
    New Yorker (per the previous thread), its just too different. Regarding the attributes
    that I found appealing. The unevenness of the top of the S is something that none
    of the other suggestions have. The stem of the R also has a subtle organic feel.
    While the spurs are also very delicately designed. As well as the consistent condensed
    letters. Maybe I'll contact Partners and Spade and see if they ever made it into
    a full typeface. Thanks everyone for the responses.
