    &#40;Canadian&#41; who has the Swastika tatooed all over his body, but he&#39;s
    not anti-Jewish. &#40;I don&#39;t use &#34;anti-Semitic&#34; here because Arabs
    are Semites too. BTW, Hitler <i>was</i> anti-Semitic: he hated Arabs too.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; &#34;vast jewish conspiracy&#34; <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t call
    it that. <BR>1&#41; It&#39;s not that vast. Armin for example hasn&#39;t been
    given &#34;The Talk&#34;, apparently - but he&#39;s from Mexico. <BR>2&#41; &#34;Conspiracy&#34;
    seems to me to mean there is intent to hurt others. In this case I think there
    isn&#39;t. But the duplicity is still there. As with any form of propaganda. And
    everybody does it. It&#39;s just more offensive when the people doing it are the
    ones already in power. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not a matter of respecting a symbol &#40;like
    you say, they don&#39;t deserve any such emotions&#41;, it&#39;s a matter of respecting
    your fellow people, and cultures - of not beating them to a pulp when they&#39;re
    already lying unconscious on the ground. &#34;Pressing need&#34;? To salvage the
    Swastika, not really. To salvage blackletter, a little bit, yes, although nothing
    like the pressing need to curb the modern-day Nazis - and I don&#39;t mean those
    impotent neo-Nazis, I mean the Axis of Evil: US, Israel, Turkey. That&#39;s proof
    right there that religion isn&#39;t the root of the problem, since the three major
    religions of the world are apparently united against humane living!  :-/ <BR>
    <BR>So I&#39;m not saying that the Jews should let go of the Swastika while others
    continue using it against them &#40;as William pointed out - even though the Nazis
    are gone while Israel is currently messing up the Middle East - so it&#39;s different&#41;,
    I&#39;m saying that there has to be less greed -and more honesty- in using it.
    We don&#39;t want another Holocaust, so back off - it&#39;s pretty simple. The
    world doesn&#39;t want you dead, they just want to live happy lives themselves
    - don&#39;t be paranoid to point of becoming Hitler yourselves. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>
    <BR>David, Matha doesn&#39;t want to answer you question - get over it. If you
    think a person can&#39;t have a rational discussion about the Swastika without
    having read those books, show us why. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    of young people for whom blackletter &#40;or the swastika for that matter&#41;
    has no inherent symbolic meaning &#40;and no bad memories&#41;, we won&#39;t be

    <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t read Heller&#39;s book either, but maybe, as a historian,
    the Holocaust is still too present for him. In this case his opinions wouldn&#39;t
    be prejudist, just misinformed ones. It would be a personal issue. <BR> <BR>ps.
    I can understand the feeling; growing up in Spain just after the transition from
    military dictatorship to democracy, the Spanish flag became a symbol for the right
    wing fascists opposed to the change. I still cannot see the flag of my country
    and feel proud about it, no matter how joyous the occasion &#40;ie. Real Madrid
    winning the soccer Champions League&#41;   ;-&#41;

    a similar effect on me. Especially when it gets waved around in unexpected contexts.  <BR>
    <BR>A friend of mine recently went to a U2 concert and apparently someone threw
    Bono an Irish flag and he sang a whole song to it. Held it in his hands and actually
    sang to it! And he&#39;d be the first person to condemn Nationalism. There were
    all sorts of Nationalist flags in the crowd too - Basque and Breton mostly. Fortunately,
    I went the next day.He sang like shite, but not to a flag.  <BR> <BR>At least
    there&#39;s no chance of seeing an Irish flag at the final of the Champion&#39;s

    <BR>Here is what the question is. <BR> <BR>Arbusto apparantly was named after
    George W. &#34;Bush&#34;. It is reported that &#34;Arbusto&#34; is/was George
    Bush&#39;s oil company. His partner/shareholder was Salem Bin Laden, &#34;Osmar
    Bin Ladens&#34; eldest brother. <BR> <BR>Is there any way you could verify that

    medieval gothics, such as Old English&#41; still evokes iron-fisted authority.
    The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!, and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these
    letterforms. Actually, anything set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and
    phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous look. <BR>....... <BR> <BR>Maybe Heller

    <BR> <BR>So, fill me in on this Heller theory. Is his complaint that Fraktur is
    offending &#34;his peoples&#34;? Or, is Heller proposing that Fraktur embodies
    some mystical evil spirit? Is there dragons in there or something? I better keep
    my lights on at night. This house if full of Fraktur. Trust me, my wife owns a
    Finnish used book store. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_fraktur2.gif"

    know fellows, I just looked at that. I think perhaps the lower case &#34;i&#34;
    is actually a very underfed one eyed cyclops. I better go get my elephant gun
    from the closet. Now that I think about it, I used to print wedding invitations
    in types resembling in some fashion that Fraktur stuff. The marriages didn&#39;t
    seem to last long. Maybe I should have stuck to Caslon Italic. You know they didn&#39;t
    last long with Caslon either. Is Caslon evil too? <BR> <BR>You know, I think I
    figured it out, it&#39;s not Fraktur, it&#39;s this: Column left, heading! <BR><a

    evil because I designed this book? I am going to hell, I know that, but surely
    not for these reasons.  <BR> <BR>So I am assuming Heller is not a racist. You
    just know how I feel about racists. So Heller must have explained his superstitions
    about Fraktur. It will be wasted on me though. I stopped having my palm read in
    the sixties. Still, I am curious. <BR> <BR> <BR>You know, this is the &#34;black
