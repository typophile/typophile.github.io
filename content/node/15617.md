  body: I suggest being a logo of a sucessful company that it was a custom job and
    not a font. Why would they want any communications to delute from the importance
    of their corporate idenity?

    target=\"_blank\">Gill Sans Light</a> and the 'r' is pretty close too. I'm guessing
    a customization of Gill maybe mixed with Nobel.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. is anyone
    else reading that as Jiz claiborne? I don't like the descended l."

    it may have started with Adrian Frutiger's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/35-light/testdrive.html?s=liz+claiborne&p=60\"
    target=\"new\">Avenir 45</a> as a model and then modified a few characters to
    make it unique."

  body: Something between Gill and Avenir, as suggest by Lex and Norbert and probably
    custom one. However, I don't have problem with the l to read that name but with
    the i. I'd suggested to add his dot on.
