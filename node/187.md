  body: Well, the Skittles logo looks like a slightly modified version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-96-black-italic/testdrive.html?s=Skittles&amp;p=48">Helvetica
    Neue Black</a> &#40;the bar on the e is pretty thin, but the other letters look
    extremely close to me&#41;. <BR> <BR>Not sure about Starburst -- it looks like
    it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to id, though, doesn&#39;t it?
