  this one has eluded me. If anyone can help ID this font, I'd appreciate it![img:sites/default/files/old-images/watersedge_6472.jpg]

  body: That's possible, but I still need to find the font that provided the base
    for the current appearance. Thanks, though.

    Pop]] is intriguingly similar, especially in that 'g', but it may be work by the
    same designer (Thomas Schostok), or someone using similar font-cutting methods
    to create a new font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just looked at Schostok's other fonts shown there and nothing is as close.
    Chris's suggestion could be a helpful way to begin re-creating it, if no one finds
    the font.\r\n\r\nThis is also the sort of thing that could be found among the
    freebies at a place like Dafont.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
