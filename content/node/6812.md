body: Looking for the font used on Nick Caves new album, Abattoir Blues / The Lyre
  Of Orpheus. <BR>This is probably an easy one due to the distinctive ampersand, but
  does anyone know ? <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>&#40;by the way, the album is great&#41;

  body: I think this could be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/roman/testdrive.html?s=Nick%20Cave%20%26%20The%20Bad%20Seeds&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank"> Sabon</a> &#40;with an italic ampersand&#41;, but the sample  <BR>is
    a bit too small to make out the finer details.

    target="_blank">Hoefler Text</a>. The ampersand is from the Italic and Hoefler
    Text also has swash characters that match &#40;if you know how to access them&#41;.
