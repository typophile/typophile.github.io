<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>i'm interested in professional opinions from the field, if the old dogma - a graphics designer has to have a mac - is still reasonable. i don't think so and strongly doubt that it's still worth spending almost twice as much money on your hardware, only to get a fancy design. <br> <br>your opinions please!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Considering the charges that can pile up at a printer, I tend to want to deliver files that printers are most comfortable with and less likely to add charges for. That usually means Mac, although it seems that Adobe is championing the windows platform. <br> <br>I rarely look at my box. It is a tool. The difference in hardware cost is mininal part of the overall picture. <br> <br>Productivity and solid multi-tasking are higher with my dual G5 than ever before. That means printing and burning discs while large uploads are moving, and having apps open and working. No crashes. This is good.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You don't need a Mac for todays desktop stuff in most cases. The Adobe tools are working nicely on both sides. For font developing, you have more and more stable tools for Win & Linux. <br> <br>The upcoming Windows Longhorn will have native OpenType feature support for Latin fonts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I find Windows unstable, overly complex, and less friendly towards getting my job done. I use both platforms on a day-to-day basis, though not for the same purposes. I can run OS X 10.3 flawlessly for weeks, even if individual apps bomb occasionally. Apple also seems to be more integrated with PS/PDF. <br> <br>One could argue that I'm biased, but there's a reason I'm biased. Plus, if the majority of designers are on Macs, then it's easier to get help/advice from fellow designers. It's not a 'you must' situation, but the extra money is well worth it, in my opinion (and not because they're pretty). <br> <br>PS: Longhorn is vaporware that's about 1-2 years out (from what I've heard) at this point. Don't make any purchasing decisions based on MS's claims about Longhorn. This has been their strategy for over a decade: out-promise the competition, then under-deliver.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've worked on a PC in the design field for over five years. The reason I switched was because the company I worked for was more web/programming focused, so we the designers needed switch to PC to work more efficiently. They wouldn't touch a MAC and I couldn't stand working on OS9. <br> <br>I guess I don't understand all the talk of PCs being unstable. Since I've had XP I have never had an all out crash and rarely do individual programs crash. I've learned to be safer surfing the web, using Firefox instead of IE and keeping my anti-virus up to date. <br> <br>The printers in my area take PC files at no extra charge and there have been no major issues with the turnout of the print runs. <br> <br>At my new job I am using a G5 running OSX 10.3 and loving it. (although I don't like that saving to the trash is an option...) I'm still not used to the font management on a MAC. I prefer the PC in that aspect. There really isn't a need for activating or deactivating fonts. They're just all there, all the time, with no slow-down on the machine. <br> <br>So now I'm split 50/50, work to home, on both PC and MAC. But I'd still buy a PC over a MAC simply because of cost and available programs (read: games)</div>

<div class=commentbody>For the most part, there isn't much of a difference between the two platforms with regard to the applications that are used. Most designers I know swear by Macs for their print jobs and PCs for their web/multimedia jobs. (Although that opinion varies depending on the end result and the application being used). <br> <br>Having worked on both platforms, myself, I have less problems at the print house when I work on my Mac (as Chris pointed out). I have had problems with fonts and postcript files in the past. Printers seem happier/more comfortable to have mac files, too. In as far as support and upgrades go, and not being a techy of any kind, I can do everything myself. I can download and update and don't have to call any support people. I don't have to worry about system crashes. I don't worry about viruses or worms. Basically, buy a mac and hit the ground running. <br> <br>I teach at a college where all the graphic designers work on Macs. I teach 150 of them and those shiny silver boxes sure are pretty in the classrooms! And Macintosh still seems to be the norm for this industry. If you think it's expensive, well, consider it an investment!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have both and have used both since 1988. And they both have individual uses <br> <br>I have an Alienware Area51M notebrick with a kick butt 3.41Ghz processor, 1680x1055 res screen, that I use for Truetype development and web development. Use FlashMX and Photoshop for design, As a laptop it's faster than any desktop machine i've every used but weights about the same at about 9lbs without the battery. <br> <br>I just upgraded my Mac to a new Powerbook to replace the old Wallstreet powerbook mainly for photographic purposes. ILife, RAW NEFF format etc. and Mac font development, i.e. AAT, and website testing. <br> <br>I've used Flash, Fontographer,email, Photoshop, FontLab and just about everything on both platforms. <br> <br>Unix on the Mac is an nice improvement but gee isn't it just going back to mainframe terminal commmand line developemnt again. And font developers use to complain about using MS-DOS tools on Windows now you have to use UNIX to do AAT.. I love it now! <br> <br>My PCs the main font develpement machine and email machine. <br> <br>My Mac is my Photographic machine, light small and nimble. <br> <br>The new MacMini, isn't that just a barebones PC? So they are all just boxes in the end.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Benchmarking is usually the best indicator. Timing specific tasks. Since clocking (1 GHz vs. 1.5 GHz, etc.) is often not the best inidicator. Chip architecture can affect performance specifically related to one task over another. <br> <br>For example, an Athlon is better for gaming vs. an equivalent Pentium, but for video work, the reverse is true.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I was once taught that "choose the best software to do the job right and then see what platform it happens to run on". Today much of the graphics software is available on both platforms and if you look at Adobe software with no feature difference (unlike the old version of Quark which didn't have ligature support on the PC). So if you just going to be running eg InDesign then it's probably a case of deciding which platform you happen to prefer – be in the OS or the shiny silver box. <br> <br>However, I think is an equally important consideration is what else is you computer being used for. For example, I am a typesetter based in Israel and although 95% of my work is actually English, I do get occassional Hebrew words thrown in or even work to be done in Hebrew. Since these files come in Microsoft Word (which is only available with Hebrew support on the PC platform) then I need a Windows operating system. True I could use an emulator on the Mac, but this is a consideration to be thought out. <br> <br>Or as another example, as a freelancer, my main computer also does everything else too including receiving and sending faxes to clients. I use a nice little program called Moony (<a href=http://www.emtec.com target=_blank>www.emtec.com</a>) which handles all my faxes and also tells me which of my clients are calling me with a nice little pop up on my computer screen. Again I use another program extension in Outlook called Taskline (<a href=http://www.taskline.info target=_blank>www.taskline.info</a>) which organises my todo list into my calendar telling me which jobs I need to do when and if a client asks me when a job should be completed by, then I can give them a real estimate. I have quite a few of these little extra programs that in my case happen to run on a PC making it a better choice for me, but could equally make the Mac a better choice for somebody else. <br> <br>Another very important consideration is technical support. If my PC should develop a fault, then I have my phone support immediately, and if necessary a technician over within an hour or two. In Israel the only Mac support is in Tel Aviv (I live in Jerusalem) and if a fault develops with a Mac then it can be a couple of weeks before getting it back. This is kind of a disaster unless you happen to have a spare Mac lying around. Again, this is a location-specific problem and I'm sure this doesn't apply to the majority of users out there. <br> <br>However, as a person who has used Mac and PC over the years, and a person that has migrated from Quark on the Mac to InDesign on the PC, I think it's about looking at the whole picture of your work environment to see what suits you. I highly specified PC is not cheap (probably a bit cheaper than a Mac), but long-gone are the days where graphics were only done a Mac.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey no one used the "mac are more beautifully designed" argument yet ;-) <br> <br>Anyways... <br>I'm (still) working on a Mac; and for 15 years I try to find enough rational reasons why I do so, but I think it's emotional ;-) <br>On a pure rational basis I think PC's win: cheaper, widespread, better support, more goodies & more compatible software... <br>I also work with PC/Windows, but it just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe just because so many people work with it? <br> <br>My Mac (& Apple for that matter): sometimes I hate them profoundly, but most of the time I find myself charmed by the way they work & look.

<div class=commentbody>"On a pure rational basis I think PC's win: cheaper, widespread, better support, more goodies & more compatible software... " <br> <br>A lot of those are myths. <br> <br>Cheaper? Not so much. Even *I* was surprised about that. My wife needed a new Windows laptop, and I though "hey, those have to be cheap" and went out hunting. It turns out, feature-for-feature, the iBook is probably the best deals in laptops out there. <br> <br>Widespread? I never use that as an argument. Wal-mart is widespread. ;o) <br> <br>Better support? No idea what that even means. <br> <br>More goodies + software? While that's true, I don't know if I'd call that a good thing. Whenever I need a utility for my PC, I need to dig through 10 crappy programs for every one good one I find. On the Mac side, it doesn't seem nearly that bad of a ratio.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I started on a Mac back in '92 when agencies were first starting to transition to using a computer...remember paste-up and mechanicals? From then until now, Macs have been a way of life for most designers. They ruled and rightly so. <br> <br>But now, it's truly emotional folks. I had to transition (kicking and screaming) into the PC world about 6 years ago. And guess what? The applications are what truly matter. <br> <br>I use a G4 with OS9, a G5 with OSX and a P4 with XP Pro -- all three have Photoshop, etc. -- and when I'm working inside an app, I could honestly *care less* which individual box I'm on at the moment. If a given machine has the horsepower, just load the app and start to work. <br> <br>As for print, Mac vs. PC used to be a huge issue, mainly with fonts and time spent on the RIP with PC files. It's all changed now. All the service bureaus we work with take PC files as well as Mac. And more importantly, we're sending new jobs via PDF -- which is eliminating any hassle completely. PDF is great for print jobs these days. <br> <br>I say, just try working on both, if you can, and make a decision. The cost of your working applications is really the biggest price factor. If your machine of choice can handle the apps that you want to use, and create the final files you need to work with others, just buy what ever you want and be happy with your decision.</div>
