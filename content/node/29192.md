body: "Does anyone know how I can print off or copy (to paste elsewhere) the paragraph/character
  style information?\r\n\r\nI can see it when I select a paragraph style and go into
  edit style from the arrow on the pallette, but I can't select the \"settings\" text
  to copy and paste. I know I could do a screen capture, but that wouldn't allow me
  to plunk it into my style guide as editable text.\r\n\r\nI'm lazy! I don't want
  to type it all out. But I would like to document it so that future users are not
  required to enter the file to find out the style info.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are
  appreciated,\r\nK.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    InDesign create as many blank paragraphs as you have styles. Assign each of your
    styles to one of these blank paragraphs. Choose File > Export and choose RTF as
    the file format. Open the text file in Word and choose File > Print. In the Print
    dialog box, choose Styles from the Print What pop-up menu.</cite>"

  body: "Oh, interesting, Jason. I asked on the Adobe forums as well, and I got a
    script which does it for me. But am glad to know. I was rather stumped and annoyed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nK."

  body: Thanks back at'cha for mentioning your post on the InD forum. I've grabbeed
    a copy of the script you mentioned and it'll be nice to be able to generate a
    list without leaving InDesign.

  body: Found the link. The link to the Adobe forum (which requires free registration)
    is http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc22375/1 . The actual link to the
    script is http://pdsassoc.com/downloads/TSRCS2.zip . The person who posted to
    provide the script says that it only works with ID CS2. Could prove useful for
    preparing a future style guide for my newspaper redesign.
