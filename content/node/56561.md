body: I DID try searching but didn't find this topic, but has anyone documented a
  list of key commands available in FL5? I'm specifically interested at this time
  in key commands for adjusting R and L side bearings from the metrics window.

  body: Tools -> Customize -> Keyboard. There are alot of shortcuts already there,
    and you can enable / add ones that don't already have a shortcut. But you probably
    already knew that. ;)

  body: "On Mac:\r\nOption+arrow changes the right sidebearing\r\nCmd+arrow changes
    the left one\r\n\r\nOn Win:\r\nAlt+arrow does not work\r\nCtrl+arrow changes the
    left sidebearing\r\nTo increase the right sidebearing you must increase the left
    one and then move the glyph to the left accordingly.\r\n\r\nNot sure if that was
    documented. :)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

  body: I'm nearly sure that there are equivalent keystrokes in FLS on Windows. Cant't
    remember right now, but try pressing ctrl <em>and</em> alt <em>and</em> arrows,
    and combine with shift and see what happens :)

  body: Ctrl does what johnych cites above, shift increases units by x10.
