  for our css stacks that are similar in aspect values and alphabet widths for a given
  font size.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe tool, FontInstead, can gather metrics of the fonts
  you have installed on your computer and give you statistics about gathered font
  metrics.\r\n\r\nPlease, visit http://adrianodigiovanni.com/fontinstead to let FontInstead
  analyze your fonts and grow the list.\r\n\r\nFontInstead is a beta project. I would
  appreciate comments, suggestions, bug reports.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nAdriano"

  body: "Adriano, I find this very interesting. Especially the alphabet length. (I\u2019m
    guessing that\u2019s pixels.) You should remember that it will vary with different
    rendering engines. Edit: x-height ratio makes a lot of sense!"

  body: "Frode,\r\nI'm happy you appreciate FontInstead.\r\nYou're right, alphabet
    width values are about pixels.\r\nI know font metrics are rendering engine related
    and I should stress on FontInstead pages that value have relative meaning only.
    So, thanks for your suggestion.\r\nWhat do you mean by \"Edit: \"?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nAdriano"

  body: "Nice! :-)\r\nThe \"storing\" part is a little slow (and unsettling in wording
    ;-). Especially since the system don't remember it if one goes back to the page.\r\nAlso,
    it's not clear exactly what is calculated as \"alphabet length\" (and it gives
    0 for some CJK fonts)."
