body: "Hello everyone...\r\n\r\ni am new to typophile and I am not fully aware of
  the different icons, navigations here. I would like to know what the icons (attached
  image) stand for? when I search for anything (in particular) I guess, i end up getting
  mixed search results. So is there a particular way I can track few discussions say
  like anything regarding kerning or about type classification... etc?\r\n\r\nwhenever
  I type keywords and open a forum, is there a way I can save it or 'favourite it'
  or something like a history of forums I have replied to. I am sorry I havnt been
  able to get a hang of it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n:)\r\nVD"

    appears at the top of a forum list (usually this is a Read Me type of thread).
    \r\n\r\nIf you have posted in a thread, then it will appear in the Track tab of
    your user account page. (Many people will post a dummy comment in order to make
    a thread appear there.)\r\n\r\nAlternately, you can bookmark a thread by clicking
    on the faint \"bookmark\" icon in the upper right of the initial post in a thread.
    When you do, the icon will turn solid and red. \r\n\r\nTo access the list of your
    marked threads, click on \"My marks\" under your account name in the upper right
    sidebar. "
