  body: I think those are also hand-drawn &#40;not fonts&#41;, but you can find some
    similar styles &#40;for free&#41; in the <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=101&amp;page=2"
    target="_blank">Cartoon category</a> at DaFont.com. <BR> <BR>You can also find
    commercial fonts in Parts 5 &amp; 14 of the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html"
