  Hoefler Titling, as well as Hoefler text?  I'm considering it for an identity profile
  job I am currently working on. The client owns a couple of hotels, apartments and
  cabins. I would like to go classic, like Minion - just a bit bolder. \r\n\r\nSo,
  is Hoefler Titling/ text a go-go or a no-no? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMrs M.\r\n\r\n "

    traditional Norwegian buildings, and hotels that have been existing for nearly
    a hundred years. Besides, this is also a part of Norway well-known for making
    silver jewelery and traditional painting, with all its swooshes and curls. Hoefler
    titling could help me make that assosiation.\r\n\r\nI was also considering Brioso
    Pro.\r\n\r\nAs you say, though, it depends on how I use it. \r\n\r\nTusen takk
    (thanks again)!\r\n\r\nMrs M."

    \r\n\r\nI was thinking of a family heirloom, a 19th century Norwegian bible set
    in fraktur.\r\nAFAIK, the garalde/humanist tradition did not exist in Scandinavia,

    Norwegians identify traditional with blackletter styles, compared with other cultures.\r\n\r\nAnd
