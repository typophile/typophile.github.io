  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&rsquo;ve been a book designer in a large publishing house for about five years now. I recently started freelancing because of a move and took a lot of fonts with me from my previous projects I did in house. Lately I&rsquo;ve been having problems with my fonts in that they are not complete sets, etc. I used to be able to look into a folder and see the font and screen font and know that I was okay. Now, I have no idea what I am looking at to know that I have a viable font. There are, for instance, in one folder, Font Suitcase, a lot of PostScript Type 1 outline fonts and a Unix Executable File. I have no idea what any of this means and if the font files will be okay for printing. Can any of you help to school me in what constitutes a good font folder? I&rsquo;m so bewildered here. Sometimes, when a font goes wacky, a little (T1) will pop up in parenthesis by my font name in INDD. I work in InDesign 3 on a Mac. Thank you so much!</div>

Given your situation you are better off to work with the fonts that are licensed with the software you’ll (hopefully) use (Adobe apps, Corel). That will give you a nice start. Add to your library when circumstances and clients warrant this.</p>
