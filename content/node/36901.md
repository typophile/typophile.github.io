body: "I need help in finding the two fonts listed above. OPTIBetLig, Beth-Light are
  the file names for the fonts I am looking for. was sent a InDesign package with
  those fonts, but for some reason they were 0kbs in the file and the designer is
  not available to send the fonts so I can fix the document. \r\n\r\nI have searched
  all over the internet for the files, but I can't find it. When I open the indd file
  it says OPTI Beth Light was not found and it is substituted with Myriad, unfortunately,
  I don't know what the font looks like as I did not receive a pdf with it. Based
  on the design and customer, it's not a cartoony font or anything eroded for that
  matter.\r\n\r\nEither the font doesn't exist anymore, or the font family name changed.
  I've had no luck on free or commercial sites nor google.\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed
  some light?\r\n\r\nIt would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nemail me at dwhite725@mac.com
  if you can help!  Thanks!  "

    name for what was originally <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=brighton\"
    target=\"_blank\">Brighton</a>. Not only are the modern versions of Brighton far
    easier to come by than the the Optis from Castcraft - they are cheaper and surely
    technically better made.\r\n\r\nHiya, Marcelo!"

  body: THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH!  It was  both of those fonts.  That Optifonts site
    is terrible to even manuever and I can't believe if I only wanted that certain
    font it's $77!
