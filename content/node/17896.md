  body: It's very likely that you won't find a match. These logos are often made by
    a professional calligrapher.

  body: "<em>These logos are often made by a professional calligrapher.</em> That
    may be true, but I would bet my shorts that this is a film type, and not hand
    lettered. The Photo-Lettering catalog is full of scripts (Part 3) that are <em>very</em>
    similar. The problem with those samples is that few initials are shown, except
    in Vol 2, at microscopic size. What is apparent is that the typefaces had many
    alternate characters, such as looped or straight ascenders, and various styles
    of initials, in the same typeface. The combinations are almost limitless. We see
    a few in the Solotype Catalog.\r\n\r\nWe can only wonder at which typefaces of
    this Photo-Lettering collection -- now in the hands of House Industries -- will
    see the light of day in an OpenType family that lets you choose from the array
    of alternate characters.  With the appetite for scripts being so insatiable (apparently),
    House would do well to develop some packages using the various categories of scripts
    they now own.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
