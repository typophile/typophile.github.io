    yours and upload it again! Then it will work!

  body: There should probably be a note in the FAQ about naming your images something
    unique before posting them... This happened to me too, the first time I added
    an image. Unless you know how the site treats the files, there's no reason not
    to name your image something generic like "sample.jpg".

  body: "> naming your images something unique\r\n\r\nThat's not a good solution.\r\nThe
    old system assigned sequential numbers to posted images, so no confusion was possible.
    In this new filename-based setup, maybe a good tweak would be for the system to
    append (I would prefix) the username (which is unique) to the filename.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Is there a reason it's not being done that way already?"

  body: BTW I know the new filename-based uploading system sucks big time. I really
    don't have a clue why they changed and it constantly creates confusion (oooh what
    a nice alliteration :^P) I'm not sure if this is being addressed, but I'll check
    with the codemeister.

    read it I knew you were right!!!\r\nI'll refer this website to all my friends!!!\r\nLori\r\n\r\nPS,
    yes very nastily bitmapped!! and you're right, I never was able to post anything
    with my messages. I saved to a gif file and jpg, and named it something arcane,
    but the system kept telling me it couldn't find the file. Is there a trick to
    posting a sample? I'd like to be able to use this forum again.\r\nThanks!"
