  all,\r\n\r\nProbably hand lettered I know, but anyone have an idea on the face the
  type on this scoreboard is based on? Or something close?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[[http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/yale/galleries/facbowl/g-facbowl10.jpg]]"

    or, at least two typefaces, one of which has three width variations.\r\nAre you
    interested in all of them?"

  body: "The words THE YALE BOWL appear to be hand-painted, but the letterforms are
    Aldo Novarese's Eurostile font, released in 1962. The date 1914 appears to be
    Helvetica (it's the year the stadium was built). The ABC logo on the banner below
    the scoreboard was designed by Paul Rand in 1962. (Coincidentally, Rand taught
    at Yale and designed the logo used by Yale University Press from 1985 to 2009.)\r\nJust
    for the record, you can find all this information in a few minutes by Googling
    \"Yale Bowl,\" \"ABC Sports,\" and \"Eurostile.\""

  body: "Thanks for all the comments, everyone.\r\n\r\nSorry, I dashed the post off
    really quickly and should have been more clear. I'm interested mainly in the multi-widthed
    main portion of the sign (it seems like everything from OFFICIAL TIME to PERIOD...
    to VISITOR is from/based on the same family). \r\n\r\nAnd yes, I realize the scoreboard's
    not from 1914. I think it just popped into my head as I saw it on the board as
    I was typing the subject heading. If I had to guess, I would say it's from the
    1954 when the stadium was renovated. \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for the help. If anyone
    has any suggestions for the rest of the lettering it would be much appreciated!"
