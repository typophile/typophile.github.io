  this forum.  MyFonts.com sent me here.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a nice modern font
  that is formal and professional looking for titles on a medical website.  I feel
  like I'm resigned to Arial or Verdana for the text on the site, so I can use common
  fonts, but I'd like the titles to be much more interesting.  I'd like to have some
  \"body\" to the font...if that is a good word.  This is a high tech site.\r\n\r\nThank
  anyone for a reply\r\n\r\nDiane Sector \r\n\r\n"

    and crisp look of Stefan Hattenbach's <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/stalemate.asp\"
    target=\"new\">Stalemate</a>, available from Fountain. According to the website,
    Stalemate \"was originally constructed as a proprietary font for a German IT-company.\"
    Moreover, it \"was designed to work both in print and on screen and experience
    shows that it performs well in both environments.\" It could be just what you're
    looking for.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to a <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/img/pdf/FTN_Stalemate.pdf\"
    target=\"new\">PDF sample</a> as well. Good luck!\r\n"

  body: "Hi Diane, \r\n\r\nFirst off, I'm not quite a professional yet, I'm a student,
    so my suggestions may not be 100%, but here they are anyways :) If you're going
    to be using a sans for the body copy, I'd recommend a serif font, or a sans with
    some character for the display type. Here's just a few of my suggestions\u2026
    \r\n\r\nDemocratica if a quirky font that is modern/hi-tech, and I don't know
    it seems kinda 'medical' to me\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/democratica/\r\n\r\nModern
    735 is more conservative, but certainly is professional, and modern.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-735/\r\n\r\nKingsbury
    Conensed is interesting.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/kingsbury-condensed-sg/\r\n\r\nUltra
    Bronzo is a sans, but has a good deal of character, fairly clean and high tech.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/ultra-bronzo/\r\n\r\nDitto
    with Copperplate Modern\u2026\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/copperplate-modern/\r\n\r\n"
