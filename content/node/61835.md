body: "Hi there, I\xB4m looking for fonts similar in spirit to american typewriter
  light. So basically I am looking for simple-structure fonts with quirky details
  here and there, such as fancy or oversized serifs, odd-designed characters and such.
  ( perhaps even going further than Amer. typewriter but still retaining legibility)\r\nIt
  doesn\xB4t matter if it\xB4s sans or serif, old or new.\r\nThanks in advance"

    Niches]] which could work too. Any other ideas?"

  body: I'm not to sure what you're looking for. Los Niches is pretty far away from
    American Typewriter. You might try looking for monoline and monospaced faces at
    MyFonts or FontShop, and just browsing them.

  body: "I know Los Niches is pretty far away from AT. What they have in common is
    some quirkiness in the ball terminals(AT) or in the overall design of the characters(LN)
    while retaining an overall readable structure. That\xB4s what I\xB4m looking for:
    A legible font with offbeat details. Does not matter is it\xB4s sans or serif.
    Just pretty fancy details in a solid structure."

  body: "Beautiful work.\r\nyes, that\xB4s exactly the kind of face i\xB4m looking
    for. You see, it\xB4s for a text-heavy packaging line, so I\xB4m looking for readability
    but a lot of personality supplied by the font.\r\nWhen are you going to release
    it, altaira? Anytime soon? \xB4cause I\xB4m working on the project right now,
    don\xB4t know if your font will be out on time for me to use it. if that\xB4s
    not possible, can you share some of the inspiration for it? any other fonts that
    have that same spirit? "

  body: "I'm glad to hear that \u2013 thank you! If you need it *now* it won't be
    early enough\u2026 but if you drop me a line at altairas_eye at mac dot com  I'll
    make sure to alert you when it becomes available.\r\n\r\nRegarding inspiration/similar
    fonts, some people think Archer is similar, but that was already mentioned in
    this thread and frankly, I myself don't think it shares the exact \"same spirit\"
    (although I like it). My inspiration has come from a whole bunch of different
    sources, most of which are actually quite different from this. \r\nBut if you
    like friendly slab serifs that are still readable at smaller sizes, there's stuff
    like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/pmn-caecilia/\">PMN Caecilia</a>
    or maybe Gerard Unger's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/oranda/\">Oranda</a>.
    But those are probably less quirky than you want \u2013 more businesslike. You
    might also like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/\">Clarendon
    Text</a>. There's a bunch of stuff in that genre\u2026 What's the packaging for
    if I may ask?"

  body: "Thank you for all the info. I\xB4ll send you an e-mail from my work address.\r\n\r\nThe
    packaging is for a chain of bakeries in Galicia, Spain. It will be applied on
    the packaging of all kinds of breads, cookies, sweets, etc. All very natural,
    rich and tasty products. Simple and delicate design for a down-to-earth yet sophisticated
    brand. No pretty pictures of the products on the packs, just see-through windows
    or transparent wrappers with colorful labels and tags. That\xB4s why they are
    so text-heavy. And that mixture of structure and quirkiness is exactly the philosophy
    of the bakery."
