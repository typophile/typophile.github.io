    the currency symbol or logical not...

  body: So you'd expect the user to install a second font called italic (or bold)
    that was the same in every regard except the direction of the /Q/? That seems
    like it would be more confusing than oldnick's solution to me.

  body: "Why? Making it a separate font (1) makes it easy for the user to change any
    or all Q's appearance, and (2) preserves the original \"data behind the font\"
    (it's still a regular \"Q\", as far as changing the font, searching, and copying
    is concerned).\r\n\r\nBut I'm curious about Ryan's\r\n<blockquote>I would like
    to offer an easy to use alternate proper Q, but can not use opentype.</blockquote>\r\nstatement.
    Are you not allowed by someone? Doesn't your software support this? Don't you
    know how?"

  body: "I agree with JamesT -- a separate font (display or alternate or whatever)
    is probably preferable. Apart from a general aversion to misleading style naming,
    you face two potential problems with using italid or bold:\r\n\r\n(1) If the user
    'italicizes' or 'bolds' a passage which contains no Q, and thus sees no change,
    they may come to think the font is defective or that it is not installed.\r\n\r\n(2)
    If you ever do decide to design an italic or bold weight, you face all sorts of
    backwards compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    Q, they would get the regular Q; but if they press ALT + Q they would get the
    alternate.  Not sure if this is possible however."

  body: "If you want the character to be searchable/sortable as 'Q', then it needs
    to be encoded as 'Q' and not as some other character. Hijacking standard codepoints
    of other characters for such a purpose would be particularly frowned upon; using
    a Private Use Area codepoint would be cleaner, but still would mean that the glyph
    is encoded as something other than 'Q'.\r\n\r\nOpenType is the obvious way to
    handle this, because OpenType Layout is specifically designed to resolve this
    issue: to allow more than one glyph to represent a single character."
