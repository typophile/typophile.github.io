body: "I am wondering if anyone has managed to create an accessible pdf (tagged for
  a screen reader) which allows footnotes to function as they should \u2013 by that
  I imagine that a footnote would be reached, read out and then return to the main
  text, possibly with an option to ignore the footnote and continue with the main
  text.\r\n\r\nThe document will have superscripted footnote number(s) in a single
  column of text with the footnote(s) at the base of the page.\r\n\r\nThe only vaguely
  pertinent piece I can find on the internet is Joe Clark\u2019s article here\r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility/\r\n\r\nI
  am hoping that there might have been more recent developments.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  any information/workarounds/ideas\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "It's a lot of manual work, but what about using links (the tool is on the
    Advanced Editing Toolbar)? For each body text superscript and corresponding footnote,
    you'd create a pair of links that point to each other. That is, when the user
    clicks on the superscript in the body text, they'll be taken to the footnote text.
    Then, by clicking somewhere in the footnote text, they'll be taken back to the
    body text superscript. Kind of a kludge, but it works. The only thing to watch
    out for is that if a link points to something too close to the bottom of a page,
    Acrobat sets the link to the top of the next page. Unfortunately, it's not easy
    to tell when something is \"too close;\" you have to set the link and then switch
    back to the hand tool to try out the link.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the body text superscript
    might be a little small, you can select one or more words in the text and create
    the link on them."

  body: "Apologies, I didn't make myself clear \u2013 the problem is that when a pdf
    is tagged so that the computer converts text to speech for visually impaired readers,
    there doesn't seem to be a satisfactory way to allow for footnotes. So far the
    only option seems to be to make it into a <note> and have the footnote read out
    as though it part of the text by changing the reading order, which isn't ideal.\r\n\r\nAn
    HTML version of the document will also be available, this is a Government document
    and they like to cover all the bases, so I have to create a tagged pdf. The links
    option doesn't seem viable as I am not sure that a speech converter allows for
    this (and I should consider the most basic equipment might be used), I do appreciate
    the advice though.\r\n\r\nIt would help if I actually knew, from a visually impaired
    reader, the limitations of the technology and how they liked to read (hear) documents
    but so far I haven't had any feedback from other tagged documents that I have
    done.\r\n\r\nLinda, thanks for the welcome back, I have been reading a few threads
    but haven't had much time to usefully contribute (and I have been diving in the
    Maldives \u2013 it's not all work, work, work).\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "\"An HTML version of the document will also be available\"\r\n\r\nThen why
    bother with the PDF?\r\n\r\nIf the issue is screen reading, most folks will NOT
    choose the PDF. They'll take HTML or Word DOCs first, as both are easier to make
    accessible and both are easier for the major screen readers to parse. (to be fair,
    maybe Adobe and the Screen Reader developers have both made massive improvements
    in their respective technologies and that's not as true anymore, but as of a few
    years ago, in talking with a blind web developer who taught accessibility classes
    I was in, the demos they showed convinced me that PDFs are pretty much useless
    for that type of accessibility requirement.)\r\n\r\nIMHO, PDFs are great as snapshops
    of a print document and for prepress. All of the other uses are just inane wishful
    thinking on Adobe's part to make it more relevant than it actually is.\r\n\r\nFYI,
    to get more specifics on this, this is a great mailing list for accessibility
    issues:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webaim.org/community/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I did tinker around with the technology for PDFs a bit when I was working on my
    thesis, as well as working on some governmental documentation. The footnote situation
    was a minor issue for me (and the linking did well in letting me choose to listen
    or not), and virtually non-existent for most of the folks who did use the technology
    that I questioned.  \r\n\r\nThe general consensus was that if you simply wanted
    to include a bibliographic reference, that it was probably better handled by endnotes
    (one needed to keep track of what the number of the note was, which was pretty
    minor), but that extensive footnoting was better dealt with by simply including
    it in the main text -- frankly, not a bad suggestion for constructing documents
    for readers in general. :-)\r\n\r\n<em> All of the other uses are just inane wishful
    thinking on Adobe\u2019s part to make it more relevant than it actually is.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    concept is a good one, and if that's the eventual goal, so much the better.\r\n\r\nBut
    \"inane\" it isn't."

    customer wants both HTML and PDF.\r\n\r\nTim, some thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Are you
    using the Read Out Loud feature of Acrobat? If so, maybe you could put the footnotes
    in as comment boxes or alternate text descriptions.\r\n\r\n2. Have you tried reordering
    the tags (View > Navigation Tabs> Tags > Order)? The tags determine the reading
    order.\r\n\r\n3. Do articles work with text-to-speech?"

    they offer tagging the footnote number as a figure and then using the figure description

    would work in a similar way.\r\n\r\n<em>Then why bother with the PDF?</em>\r\nGiven
    the choice I would prefer to avoid it altogether it takes an age to do and the
    HTML would work just as well (or so I am told), however the client gets what the
    client wants and it is possible that some readers will only use pdfs I suppose.\r\nI
    will examine the webaim website.\r\n\r\n<em>a bibliographic reference, that it

    this case, it has been difficult to persuade them that using a tinted colour coded

    be passing on information/advice to clients.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nTim"

  body: "\"I think he means that his government customer wants both HTML and PDF.\"\r\n\r\nWhich
    I'd toss back at the customer as 'why?'\r\n\r\nRegardless, if they do want both,
    then there's not a whole lot of reason to worry too much about the PDF in terms
    of accessibility if the HTML one is accessible. IMHO, of course.\r\n\r\nJust seems
    redundant to have both. HTML is so much more universal in terms of disseminating
    information in an as accessible manner as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Given the choice
    I would prefer to avoid it altogether it takes an age to do\"\r\n\r\nExactly!
    ;o)\r\n\r\nThat goes back to my 'inane' statement. PDFs are great for a few base
    things, but Adobe has been piling on feature after feature that a) can usually
    be handled better by another technology/format and b) aren't easily created in
    any easy/intuitive fashion via Acrobat's odd UI.\r\n\r\nUltimately, HTML is often
    more adept and handling most of the 'other' features found in a PDF, so it becomes
    a 'why reinvent the wheel' kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThat said, as a dot-gover myself,
    I certainly understand the odd request, as I deal with it all the time myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
