    was not a typographer and the rest are hardly representative of Russian typography.
    For all the coverage historians give it, constructivism was really a short lived
    blip in the history of Russian art and design (to some extent because the state
    banned it entirely), but as with most of design, there\u2019s much more to appreciate
    once you get out of the boring little box of modernism."

  body: "Dez, I can sort of \"read\" the characters but don't have a single idea of
    wot it means :-) (Same with Greek, actually.)\r\n\r\nSomehow\"Knyga\" = \"book\"
    stuck into memory (in several languages: Greek: \"biblio\", but more correct should
    be \"vivlio\"; in Arabic, \"kitab\"). Simple extrapolation led me to believe it's
    a \"Book of Letters from A to Z\".\r\n\r\nBut I like the rhythm of written Cyrillic,
    in the way I like French rap songs. A bit like admiring a poem written in finest
    Japanese calligraphy -- no clue what everyone is so excited about but it sure
    looks good."
