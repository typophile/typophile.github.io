So a jackass for jesus would be someone who doesn't have it all together, yet God chooses to use them anyway&hellip; <BR> <BR> <BR>i actually didn't change the 'f' to look like a cross, just wanted it to line up with the bottom of the j's.  <BR> <BR>tim, i'm curious what exactly you mean about rotating the question mark to make it look better. I guess i don't really see it. <BR> <BR>i'm going to see if i can thin out the j's and i'll post my changes hopefully later on tonite. Thanks for the input!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, Jews read the Tanach, or Torah Shebiksav, which is <i>not</i> limited to the five books of Moses: the latter is a common misconception among gentiles. The term Torah by itself refers to the five books, but the Torah Shebiksav also contains the Nevi'im (Prophets) and Kesuvim (Writings). Altogether they form the Palestine Canon of 24 books; note that this is a different canon from that which was read in Christ's time: in Christ's time Jews read the Septuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Torah Shebiksav. <i>After</i> Christ's time, the Jews returned to the Hebrew text, but decided to leave out those books which had traditionally been part of the canon of scripture but for which they were unable to locate <i>complete</i> Hebrew manuscripts. These seven books are retained in Catholic and Orthodox Bibles, but were removed by the Protestants in what you would refer to as 'content management', and are referred to by Protestants as the Apocryphal books. Catholics call them the Deuterocanonical books. <BR> <BR>Jews, Catholics and Orthodox Christians all maintain a strong tradition of <i>non sola scriptura</i>; that is, unlike Protestants, they do not rely solely on scripture as a source of truth, but also on tradition and teaching authority. In Judaism, this tradition is traced to Moses and is called the Torah Sheb</div>
