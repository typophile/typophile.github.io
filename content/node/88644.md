body: "hi all,\r\n\r\ni\u2019m working on a font that contains a ballot box (uni2610)
  and a ballot box with checkmark (uni2611). to access these i\u2019m using the dlig
  feature where the string \u2018[]\u2019 is replaced by uni2610 and \u2018[x]\u2019
  by 2611. like so:\r\n\r\nsub [ x ] by uni2611\r\nsub [ ] by uni2610\r\n\r\nthe problem:
  brackets are part of the feature language syntax and therefore mean something else
  when used in feature definitions. is there a way to still be able to use them as
  i want to use them?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nalex"
