body: "[SOLVED]\r\n\r\nThere is this videogame logo that uses three different versions,
  each for its own label, except \"GENERALS\" text that is hand-drawn I am certain
  about. I am looking for exact typefaces, any ones that strike similar look and preferably,
  free ones, would do, if else not any, I am willing to pay few bucks, fine work.
  I will be doing commercial-free graphic design with strong influence of games' modern
  military theme, so license must cover that, as per usual.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0e7htbn.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso
  this I would like to know the name of, which is displayed for headings on my Generals
  Deluxe Edition units poster\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/p7frfOo.png\r\n\r\nI had
  the name before, seen it plastered on some other games fan art. Help me God I remember
  this now haha\r\n\r\nActually I ran images for every element of the Zero Hour logo
  in their original versions and with background cropped each through most popular
  font search engines, including and not limited to, MyFonts, Font Matcherator, WhatFontIs
  and the like, with no valuable indication if these even exist.  Nothing. Nada.\r\n\r\nNo
  good alternatives I can think of, 'quite specific glyph design too."

    like Tycho, too dumb to even think about that even. \r\n\r\nWith a bit of luck
    I have dug up an image that contains an old logo of mine /circa 2009/ with the
    exact same font used for the subheading on the official EA logo. Then again gotta
    design rest myself."
