  to see how much interesting is being paid to typefaces these days.\r\n\r\nBy profession,
  I'm a programmer, so I need to use monospace fonts for nearly everything.  While
  I've heard people gushing on about Helvetica, I've never seen much discussion of
  fonts that could replace Lucida and Courier.\r\n\r\nCan any of you point me to some
  excellent, readable, beautiful typefaces that follow the monospace standard?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I see that none of the examples has tried as hard as IBM did with Bookface
    Academic, or Diplomat (not available for Selectrics in the U.S., but it was available
    for U.K. typewriters) to be a monospaced typeface that doesn't look like a monospace
    typeface.\r\n\r\nOf course, trying to make a monospace version of a traditional
    Roman typeface <em>does</em> run the very strong risk of making a monospace typeface
    that looks even worse than one that doesn't do that, but IBM in those two examples
    seems to have managed fairly well.\r\n\r\nIf you scroll down, you can see a little
    bit of Diplomat on [[http://munk.org/typecast/2011/04/25/1964-nomda-blue-book-ibm-font-styles/|this
    page]]."

    Source Code Pro and then later Input. On my screen, at least, its rendering seems
    crisper. I know little about font rendering, but perhaps its narrow width with
    tight curves helps with this. Also, compared to the other two, scanning words
    is easier yet it is still easy to descern crucial details such as punctuation."
