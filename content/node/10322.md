  <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;m going to call it &#34;Apprenti&#34;, apprentice in french.
  As I said in my last post, I think it looks way too pretty, too much like Optima.
  Maybe I need to reduce the contrast in the strokes?'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m encouraged by the progress I&#39;m making both in terms of the
    font itself as well as what I&#39;m learning in general. I think it&#39;s starting
    a lot less pretty, which is good, but at the same time retaining it&#39;s own
    characteristics. Also, I think once spacing and weight issues are resolved, it
    will make a highly readable text face, which was the original goal. <BR> <BR>If
    anyone feels like commenting, I&#39;d love feedback.'

  body: I like this design. Why is nobody else commenting on it? I am posting this
    comment mainly to bring this thread to the front, as I would like to see what
    the experts think of it. There seems to be a strange forum effect, where stuff
    goes without comment for weeks, then you get a whole pile in one day.

  body: "I said I liked the design, but without any explanation, which is pretty useless
    as a critique. I did not have time to do more when I posted.\r\n\r\nOne reason
    I like the design is that it is a contrasty sans serif. I am fond of such fonts
    in general. I have made several attempts to produce a nice contrasty sans serif
    font, but they appear to be inherently difficult for some reason. Your design
    looks like it has fixed many of the problems I encountered.\r\n\r\nThe use of
    tapered strokes on some horizontals and verticals is interesting. This help fix
    the tendency for thin unterminated strokes to look weak, particularly in the capitals.\r\n\r\nThe
    body text sample is nice and readable, I would say.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of
    criticisms. Please take these with a pinch of salt, because I am just an interested
    amateur.\r\n\r\nThe slanted cuts on the tops of the lower case verticals work
    nicely, and harmonise with the classic feel of the design. However, I am not sure
    about the same feature applied in the capitals, which would not have slanted serifs
    in a classic design. I also wonder if both verticals in 'u' should be cut at a
    slant, instead of just the left one.\r\n\r\nThe tapered central stroke of the
    'e' looks a bit odd. Perhaps it should taper the other way (thick at right to
    thin at left), or not be tapered at all, as this stroke does not need a taper
    to firm it up.\r\n\r\nIs there a good reason why the tapered horizontals should
    only appear at the bottom of E, Z and z? If you are hinting at the effects of
    serifs on the thin horizontals, I would have thought that the top strokes want
    tapers as much as the bottom ones. The single taper on the thin strokes of X and
    x looks a bit odd. The thin top right does not harmonize with similar stokes in
    Y, v, w, y.\r\n\r\nI am perhaps being too conventional and obsessed with consistency
    in many of the above comments.\r\n\r\nAnyway, keep up the good work. "

  body: Overall I like this typeface. The only crit I'll make is about the e. I find
    his counter to big. It also could be the oblique you use in inside that seems
    do not fit with the other glyph. Or, just raise this middle bar.

    a Syntax to Optima arena which is not attempted much--meaning you have chosen
    a good niche without lots of similar work in competition. I would like to see
    text in smaller sizes. it makes seeing it as a text font easier for me. I like
    the feeling of leaning caused by the strees in your b d p q.  You might try tightening
    the letterspacing a bit overall.  It feels a tad loose to me.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    more loosely spaced that the l/c. On page 2 of the pdf, the caps appear to drift
