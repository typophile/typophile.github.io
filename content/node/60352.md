  of classic faces like Bembo or Plantin from Linotype/Monotype kern by class? \r\n\r\n(We
  need to add a few glyphs like \u1E47; it's a simple matter to add the new glyph
  to a kerning class. Not sure we want to purchase if it's not kerned by class.)\r\n\r\nThanks,

  body: Hmmm. Thanks for that point. What does getting that special permission involve?
    What are the repercussions (practically speaking) for some small fry like myself
    ignoring the aforesaid restriction, in a friendly spirit of "I need this letter
    which your font doesn't provide, so I am quietly adding it for my own personal
    use, no harm intended or offense implied"?

    is I have no idea. \r\n\r\nIf you don't do get permission? ... well, I don't suppose
    it's likely you'll get caught, but I just don't think it's good to patronize companies
    that offer terms you don't like: it encourages them. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice
    if you told them that modifications are important to you, and that your buying
    decisions will be influenced by this."

  body: The EULAs for Linotype and Monotype don't allow modification of their fonts
    without special permission, so you might want to consider that first. Adobe's
    EULA does, as does the EULAs from _some_ others (Shinntype comes to mind.)
