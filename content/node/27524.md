  logo is set in... Incidentally, this would be the same typeface that my beloved
  Steelers' logo is set in as well. Sometime in the early 60's, the Steelers petitioned
  the American Iron and Steel Institute to change the word 'Steel' to 'Steelers'.
  So they added a lowercase 'r' at that time. It's a distinctive lowercase 'r'. I
  thought I'd check here to see if anyone had any guesses. Thanks!"

  body: "I think it was a custom design. The most unusual feature is the 'e', which
    is somewhat like that in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=EF.8219.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Steelers&sampleSize=48\">Aachen.</a>
    With the Steelmark colors and these letters, it might not be obvious at first
    that this isn't the exact original typeface. A little editing to remove the serifs
    would make the resemblance even closer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Excellent. Thanks for the suggestions. I'm in touch with the American Iron
    and Steel Institute, and I'm assuming what they will tell me is that it is custom.
    On my Steelers t-shirt, I just noticed that the crossbar of the 't' is shorter
    on the left than it is on the right. I thought maybe it was to accomodate for
    the 'S', a sign of it being hand drawn, but maybe this is normal feature of this
    type of lowercase 't'...
