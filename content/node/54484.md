  was busy enquiring about domain names and saw there was a company with the same

  suppose it wasn't the MOST original idea in the world - still, it's pretty frustrating.
  Back to the drawing board I guess..."

    And FWIW, your logo is much better."

  body: "When choosing a name for a new company, the first thing you should do with
    potential names is to search for them on the Internet. Although the fact that
    you don't find your potential name on the Internet is not an absolute guarantee
    that the name isn't in use, it's a good start.\r\n\r\nThere is another way to
    search for possible conflicts that perhaps you should not use (although I am not
    sure): A friend told me that he did a domain name search for a potential company
    name and found the domain available, but when we tried to register that name a
    little later, it was no longer available. He thinks that some people monitor domain
    name requests (how they can do this, I don't know), and then register names they
    find there so that the original searchers will have to buy the domain name from
    them. To me this seems like a lot of work and expense for uncertain results, but
    if it's true you could be risking your potential domain name by searching for
    it before you're ready to register it.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When
