body: "I'm putting together a website for a small research lab at Texas A&M. A rough
  cut of the logo I'm working on is attached. I'm trying to put together something
  minimal and classic. (Although I don't know exactly what I mean by \"classic\".)\r\n\r\nThe
  lines depict the streamlines of a Taylor vortex. Since the streamlines are nothing
  special (to the audience who will see the logo), I'd like to add something that
  makes the logo more distinctive so that it can stand separate from the word mark.\r\n\r\nThis
  first one is my favorite.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tvl_logo_3819.png]\r\n\r\nI
  also considered this arrangement.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option1_3978.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
  this was the logo when I was at Arizona State University.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asu_tvl_logo_4353.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

  body: "i have to say that i really like the mark, although i don't think it says
    vortex or lab to me. it feels, in fact, aboriginal, or reminiscent of a petroglyph
    or something. the infinity mark doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\nalthough there's a
    very clean quality to your type, the all lowercase isn't working well here. the
    ascenders and descenders are creating akward spaces.\r\n\r\nkeep trying! you have
    the start of some interesting ideas."

  body: "Thanks for the comments. Here's minor revision. The arrows try to address
    the lack of vortexness and are the start of making something that can stand on
    its own. I have another idea for the vortex, but it'll take some more math to
    make it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tamu_tvl_logo_5063.png]"

    UC, and nestled under T-V between the \"y\" and \"x.\"\r\n\r\njust a thought."

  body: I like your second arrangement. I like the weight of the mark next to the
    word mark, I would not use the graphic mark twice and would not tint it either.
    I looks off balance.  Just an idea. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/revised_3686.jpg]

  body: "I think the small \"laboratory\" gives some necessary emphasis to \"Taylor-Vortex\"
    over \"laboratory\". I agree don't that the 4 arrows aren't doing much.\r\n\r\nOne
    arrow communicates the idea, which is that the flow circulates within a vortex
    cell. This is also the reason for having two cells in different colors: they're
    formed in pairs that counter-rotate. The arrows shown here depict the jet between
    them. There is of course meaning in other places: 1) competition and symmetries
    (and symmetry breaking) are important themes in the problem; 2) the vortices are
    enclosed between two concentric cylinders; 3) our apparatus is horizontal as opposed
    to the more common vertical apparatus.\r\n\r\nHere's a new cut that I think incorporates
    some of the suggestions. It's an improvement and I like Frutiger over the previous
    Avenir, although it still needs some work. I'm not sure I like the placement of
    \"Texas A&M\" in particular.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option4_6128.png]"

  body: I prefer the font your using but I think there is too much going on. The placing
    of texas a&m feels really tight to me. Let it breath a bit. I prefered the mark
    without the arrow, although I understand why you have it. I would drop the reflection.
    Having the two different colours makes it look like two logos as well.

    the appearance of two logos.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option4_6606.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    another, sans arrows and with less combative coloring.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option5_4616.png]\r\n"

  body: My only problem with the swirls next to one another is - and not to be crude
    - that it resembles... erm... certain feminine assets. And the side-by-side placement
    also strengthens the cave drawing/primitive impression that seems a bit out of
    place for a lab.

    uppercase. with it all down-style, it feels very diminutive. too quiet.
