body: "Working on a magazine grid where the main body copy is 8.5/10. I need some
  auxiliary sizes eg \"large copy\" and \"caption/small copy\". I'm thinking about
  10.5/12 and then 6.5/8 for captions and other small text. Would using a 2pt baseline
  grid be ideal? I know it can get messy, I'm just wondering what the best solution
  is.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Do not go there. Grids that are too fine are no good, they miss the point
    of using a grid. I prefer using baseline-shift to get some variety in the typography.
    Example in case: subheadings in bodytype can be too close to the bodytype \u2014
    use the blank line before the subheading to solve this. Baselineshift in the order
    of  a fifth or quarter of the leading will do the trick.\r\n\r\nFor captions that
    have to use less leading (aka linespacing) use the InDesign-feature Align first
    line to grid only in Paragraph Style. Go for solid fractions of the grid and you
    are all set : )"

  body: "The method used by Bert is interesting, but have two drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThe
    first is that this blank line will sometimes be the first of a column and may
    needed to be removed. Also consider the changes the matter may suffer until the
    final version: the blank line is removed, the text reflows due a layout change
    and now the blank line is needed again. More additional work and good possibility
    to a misplaced subhead.\r\n\r\nSecond question occurs when the subhead is the
    first line of a column or box. The baseline shift will cause the subhead to be
    above the other first lines. And if you don't shift the baseline, the subhead
    will become different from the others, very near to text body.\r\n\r\nIf you keep
    a blank first line just to put the subhead some points above baseline, the problem
    about different first lines remains.\r\n\r\nVertical alignment is not suitable
    for this job? Every time I can use it nowadays, I prefer over the grid-based layout.\r\n"
