  body: "ITC Mona Lisa is a digitization of Albert Auspurg\u2019s 1930 design for
    Ludwig & Mayer. Jaspert's Type Encyclopaedia [1970] comments that the \"modern
    face design is not unlike the same founders' Firmin Didot.\"\r\nNote that the
    Auspurg\u2019s font was an open face. Pat Hickson created Mona Lisa Solid by filling

    serif design -- tall, thin and very regular -- suggest a futuristic cold spirituality
    rather than joy or human warmth. A good fit for this rather depressing movie.\"\r\nI
    wonder if it looks warmer and more optimistic in the National Week of Prayer image?
    I have my doubts.\r\nDon\r\n"
