  <BR> <BR>Seems like there are 2 different fonts in here. <BR> <BR>The &#34;E&#34;,
  &#34;B&#34; and the &#34;a&#34;...then the rest of the letters are the same.

  body: It looks custom... <BR> <BR>The E is clearly a modified ampersand, as the
    B &#40;the same, tilted, with the vertical stem added later from an lower case
    l. I can&#39;t see the a well, but surely is made cutting and pasting things.
    <BR> <BR>The rest looks plain Times.
