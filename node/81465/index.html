  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m trying to code my opentype features in the most efficient way, but not sure about what order they need to go in.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to achieve using dlig and salt.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/opentypeligs_6336.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The first line is what appears by default, using just <code>liga</code>. The f has a slightly shorter hood.</p>
<p>Second, the only difference is the descender, this should be a stylistic set.</p>
<p>Third, using <code>dlig</code>, the crossbar or hood joins onto the next glyph.</p>
<p>Fourth, if we want descending and joining ligatures, we can apply the stylistic set and the <code>dlig</code> feature.</p>
<p>Codewise:</p>
<p><code>liga</code> 
#something like
sub f&rsquo;f' by ff; #where ff is a tweaked composite of two fs.
#etc for other ligs</p>
<p><code>ss01</code>
#sub f' [b f h i j k l t] by f.alt; #where f.alt is the descending version.
#plus some other substition to fix the double f ligs.</p>
<p><code>dlig</code>
sub f' f' by f_f; #where f_f is the connected variant
#etc for other ligs</p>
<p>Now where do I stick the code that applies when both ss01 and dlig are applied? In both features? Is my code really messy?</p>

<p>—If you want the descender AND the ligatures in the same glyph, I’d say that you need to add some new glyphs to the font.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For something like this, my inclination is usually to do the stylistic variation first, and then the ligation. Since your ligatures seem to be all variants on the common f-ligature, I don&rsquo;t think &lsquo;dlig&rsquo; is appropriate. I would use &lsquo;ss01&rsquo; and &lsquo;liga&rsquo;, in that order. In other words, the input for the &lsquo;liga&rsquo; feature will include output forms from the &lsquo;ss01&rsquo; feature, e.g.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ss01&rsquo;
f -&gt; f.ss01
&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;liga&rsquo;
f f -&gt; f_f
f.ss01 f.ss01 -&gt; f_f.ss01
&hellip;</p>
<p>What you should consider is what behaviour would be appropriate if a user has turned on &lsquo;ss01&rsquo; for only part of a ligating sequence, i.e. what should happen in &lsquo;liga&rsquo; if the input sequence is</p>
<p>f f.ss01</p>

<p>John, thanks&hellip;well, I didn&rsquo;t put the other ligatures in that image, there are LOTS of them :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try what you suggest and see what happens. I&rsquo;ll check what happens with the half-and-half situation too. Good catch.</p>
<p>Frode, maybe, is calt on by default? My knowledge of this stuff is very patchy! First step is to make some classes to make the code neater&hellip;back soon.</p>

<p>John, by the way, if the features are applied to one part of a sequence, all of it stays as the default glyphs. Not sure what would be best in that instance, and also where would the code go?</p>

<p>That would be an alternate of a single f, not a replacement for three f&rsquo;s. How about f_f_f.dlig?</p>
<p>The main thing as far as what features to put things in, is whether the feature is on or off by default, and whether the user will be confused or comfortable with the groupings of alternates together in a single feature&hellip;.</p>
