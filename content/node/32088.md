  which has a great feature on tweaking text on a curve. \r\n\r\nI'm curious if anyone
  has any other insight into the process of text on a curve. I'm working on a packaging
  label that will be set in a circle and could use some tips. Leslie of course is
  a master so, some of his steps seem to miss that extra novice detail."

    to me.\r\n\r\nI think the thing you have to watch out for is making sure the baseline
    curves properly. It may be tricky depending on the letters and typeface you're
    working with.\r\n\r\nDoes that help or is there something more specific you're
    having a problem with?"

  body: "Andrew, my copy of LFLB is at the office, so excuse me if I duplicate advice
    already offered therein. Putting text on a curve messes royally with the inter-character
    spacing, so you'll <em>always</em> need to kern and respace to achieve even typographic
    colour right around the curve. Word spacing should almost always be closed up
    for the same reason.\r\n\r\nI always found it safer to a) do this on a copy of
    the setting in case I mess it up and have to revert to the original, and quicker
    to b) get the spacing done satisfactorily before any 'convert to paths' operation.\r\n\r\nIn
    a lot of cases where the text runs around a complete circle in an 'over and under'
    fashion, it can help to place punctuating dingbats, flowers or bullets symmetrically
    (say at at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock) \u2013 again to fill gaps and achieve even
    colour.\r\n\r\nPrinting a proof and examining it upside down from a distance is
    a quick way to check for spottiness and bad spacing. \r\n\r\nLeslie talks quite
    a lot about making the baselines and foot serifs of the type follow the curve,
    which is easily done after the 'convert to paths' operation. You'll need to work
    with duplicates of the original circle (in the original position relative to the
    type outlines) and the pathfinder function."

  body: "Excellent. I think the most difficult part is the kerning and spacing, because
    the baseline gets crowded really fast. \r\n\r\nLeslie's explanation for masking
    and clipping the edges doesn't explain if I should extend the tops of letters
    and then clip them like I would have done for the baseline and foot serifs.\r\n\r\nI'm
    using Freight Sans because it seems to be the most forgiving without losing much
    character. The Text is: <strong>CERTIFIED</strong> along the top curve and <strong>PEST
    FREE</strong> along the bottom curve, inverted of course. Do I need to worry about
    the center arms of the E and F?"

    is a classic reason for custom 'lettering'. One way to escape from the font's

    It's always interesting to hear what you think. And I agree with you that the

    to read. Since Andrew said this project is behind him & he didn't want a further

    his perogative even if it wouldn't be my own choice.

    going on in the world of design in general, and it seems fruitful to explore middle
    grounds here between the clumsy charm of the original and the neutered functionality
    of the remake. And really it's not just about \"charm\": I might suggest that
    the original's textural difference between the circular text and the \"DoD\" in
    the middle is a highly functional form of contrast.\r\n\r\nSpeaking up against

    the type in a circle smaller to let you soften the problems in the interletter
    spaceing that persist in both designs. And raise the Dod to make it optically
    balance better.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what to say about the DoDAAC. Without knowing
    what the stuff on the right means & how important or unimportant it is I am at
    a loss. \r\n\r\nI have an idea that the design might be better without the square
    boxes or with some other strcuture instead. And as I said - it would be good (
    probably) if it were slightly more eye catching in the way that the 'fragile symbol'
    or the 'keep out of damp ( umbrella) symbol' on boxes is. Not hugely - but enough.\r\n\r\nHrant?"

    corresponding to the location that the last certification was performed. It consists
    of 5 numbers and a letter such as 12345A.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Fragile or \"umbrella\"
    symbol that would be placed predominently on a cardboard box (probably atleast
    on 4 if not all sides), this Pest free stand would be used to indicate any and
    all wood used in a wood container (or any container using wood material such as
    a palette). So proliferation of the stamp could be as much as 1 stamp or a 100
    stamps on a single container. The boxed layout was predetermined by an international
    committee not a designer.\r\n\r\nThis stamp is used in conjunction with several
    stamps... which might give you an understanding of why I didn't kill myself redesigning
    this stamp. Honestly, I'm not really sure why I did other than I wasn't as impressed
    with the \"charm\" that Hrant sees in the original.\r\n\r\nHrant, I might have
    considered reattempting the \"centrifuge\" distortion if I knew how it was achieved
    in the first place. Like the original topic suggests, I wasn't as proficient in
    creating text on a circular path, let alone manipulating it beyond a certain point. "

    look like poop to me. I think it's kind of charming that Hrant likes the old one
