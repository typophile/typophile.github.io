  offers security on a wide range of security-service for businesses and private people.
  They used to have a round logo and thats the only thing my client requested. Ive
  done a few different roughs for now. Let me know what you guys prefer or if you
  even like it.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4991.jpg]"

  body: "They're nice and clean, but I don't know if you pushed your ideas as far
    as they could go. I don't really read security in the top 2, the chain I kinda
    get, and the eye not so much. Have you considered a lock and chain perhaps or
    a shield? \r\n\r\nThe type is clean, but some of the letters need tweaked in the
    curved layouts. Specifically the M. "

    logos]] in my opinion (besides being a little creepy!)\r\n\r\nI actually do like
    the more abstract nod to security of the top ones. Go too literal and you quickly
    look clich\xE9d, IMO."

    them up so they look more stabil (thanks Lex - good point)...\r\n\r\nI agree with
    the eyes though...that really don't work. \r\n\r\nThanks guys... I'll be back\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that has some weight.\r\n\r\nThe words I'd associate with security company are:\r\n\r\n-durable\r\n-heavy\r\n-steadfast\r\n-stable\r\n-solid\r\n-thick\r\n-encompassing
    (a circle is perfect for that)\r\n\r\nbest of luck, I'd really like to see more
    things along the line of the top-right all-black one"

  body: 'I like the eye with the round text, with no box. I think if you give more
    blank spaces between the letters may make it readable. As for the eye, the light
    shape maybe angular, will make it angrier. '

    to move away from the 'market' look. Maybe add a shield as was suggested.\r\n"
