body: "Hello all. I need to re-create this logo for use on a banner as they seem to
  have lost the original files. I've managed to figure out a very close approximation
  for the serif face, but an accurate identification of that would be hugely helpful
  as well. The script is my big problem. I know I've seen the font, and I would have
  sworn I have it, but no luck so far. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for taking a look
  at this."
