  body: Just updated Flash a few hours ago. The problem is that when I click on preview,
    I can see the post, including the image, but after I click save, the only thing
    that shows up is the text whithout the attachement. I will try again.

  body: I think someone already mentioned this. It seems that, in order to have the
    image displayed, one must "save" without previewing.

    save, the image gets properly embedded.\r\nSafari 4 on Mac 10.5.8, Flash plugin
