  have done one, and I am wondering what kinds of tips one might have.  These are
  big files (40\"x27\" @ 300dpi) and I am finding working with the files to be cumbersome.
  \ \r\n\r\nOne specific question:\r\n\u2022 When you are working on comps, do you
  use low res imagery and rebuild hi-res later?  Wondering if this might be a good
  idea.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some ideas to speed this up!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n"

    full size and then reduce for comments.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to work the way
    you are proposing with one caveat: make sure your assets are going to survive
    the transition to that large size.\r\n\r\npeace"

    a dual G5 it's still chugging. \r\n\r\nHow many gigs of ram do you have?\r\n\r\n"

    of whatever you're doing in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nWhat program are you laying it out
    in? If it's PS (and I kind of doubt it) it's going to be slow. If you use ID then
    the preview will be lo res unless you tell it not to be and this will go a lot
    faster for you.\r\n\r\npeace"

    lot of texture in this.  I think this is why. Plus my file is around 1g! \r\n\r\nBut
    as soon as I lay type in ID should be gravy.\r\n\r\nMight need to upgrade the
    ram.\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks for the thoughts paul."

    you have a dedicated scratch disk?\r\n\r\nThis will speed up matter a lot.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have an external Firewire 800 it will do just fine.\r\n\r\nBest of Luck!\r\n\r\npeace"
