  body: The symbol looks nice, and would be legible and easy to produce for signs.
    I'm not sure if the font chosen goes with it. Is that Cholla? Something a bit
    more geometric looking, such as House Industries' Simian or even an old favorite
    like Handel Gothic might fit better. Just my opinion though.

  body: "The viz part of the type seems rather geometric when viewed with the other
    characters I would look at either a different font or amending viz to compliment
    the others.\r\nTim"
