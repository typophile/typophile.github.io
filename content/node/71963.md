body: "I've done a lot of work on [[http://typophile.com/node/40757|Rekord]] recently,
  so I thought I'd share it with you. Since it has developed so much, I thought I'd
  start a new thread in the sans-serif section. The new Rekord will, if all goes well,
  be a six-weight family with italics, and be available later this year (after I've
  finished [[http://vllg.com/Incubator/Tram#panel=poster|Tram]], which is more than
  overdue).\r\n\r\nAlso, Rekord is the new typeface used by [[http://rpho.nl/|Rotterdam's
  Philharmonic Orchestra]], which I'm very happy about. More can be seen here: [[http://www.gergievfestival.nl/|Gergiev
  Festival]]\r\n\r\nThere's still a lot to do and refine, but so far I'm happy with
  the development... and curious to hear what you think.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nHanno\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/REKORD_July2010_5199.jpg]"

  body: "Looking great! I'm weary of techno fonts but this is very lively and interesting,
    and carefully crafted. The bolder weights have a bit of early Soviet poster aesthetic
    to my eyes.\r\nOn the alternates, I really dislike the M's and N's (but of course,
    as alternates I'd be free to ignore them).\r\nFor the diagonal alts, did you consider
    making that change in angle a bend rather than a rigid angle?\r\nThe figures look
    like credit-card numbers to me. I wonder if six and nine can somehow partake of
    the interesting diagonals that are the typeface's signature (e.g. P/R).\r\n"
