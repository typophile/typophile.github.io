    interesting to see that at least two of the names mentioned, Laurenz Brunner and

  body: "April Greiman is an American who also went to Basel in the early 70s where
    she met and married the late Dan Friedman (a classmate of mine at CMU).  Her typography
    was very Basel influenced even though she was annointed with the \"New Wave\"
    label by the design press. When I took classes with Weigart in the mid eighties,
    he spoke of April fondly and referred to her as a \"Painterly typgrapher\" .\r\n\r\nChrisL"
