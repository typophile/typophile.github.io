body: If you&#39;re making a website, how can you get an icon to show up in the web
  address? Couldn&#39;t find out how using google, plus, I only looked at the first
  few pages. I&#39;m tired! Thanks for the help in advance. <BR>- Brian - <BR>

  body: .ICO is a Windows native icon format. I didn&#39;t know PNGs work,  <BR>which
    is great because only a few non-standard apps can create  <BR>.ICOs. <BR> <BR>On
    the Mac, only Safari will show them. But, Netscape and IE for  <BR>Mac are dead.
    Long live Safari. <BR> <BR>Zara, are you sure IE supports the PNG favicon for
    Windows? I  <BR>know IE doesn&#39;t support PNGs in web pages &#40;unless that&#39;s  <BR>changed
    in the last 6 months&#41;.

  body: I have no clue if the PNG works in Windows, and I haven&#39;t seen this work
    in IE. Aside from Safari, I know it works fine with Mozilla. Honestly, sometimes
    I forget that IE even exists and well, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch a machine
    running Windows with a stick. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    a baseball bat or a hockey stick. <BR> <BR>Z

    <BR> <BR>Stick of Dynamite might work for you. I always get a big bang out of
    Windoze that way but you might prefer your own way of sticking it to them ;-&#41;'

  body: '&#62; <i>But, Netscape and IE for Mac are dead.</i> <BR> <BR>Actually, Netscape
    isn&#39;t quite dead yet. The current iteration  &#40;<a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/">version
    7.1</a>&#41; uses a branch of the Mozilla code base, just like the Firefox, Camino,
    and Mozilla browsers do. All of them support ico files. There&#39;s a bit more
    &#40;slightly dated&#41; information reagrding corss-browser ico file support
    on the <a href="http://favicon.com/">favicon.com</a> site. <BR> <BR>By the way,
    to easily build .ico file on the Mac &#40;or Windows for that matter&#41;, try
    Toby Thain&#39;s donationware Photoshop plug-in. There&#39;s one that creates
    icobundles as well. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/" target="_blank">http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/</a>'
