  Grotesk/Helvetica:\r\n\r\nAlan Marshall and Lewis Blackwell both wrote that Max
  Miedinger designed Helvetica between 1951 and 1953, but this year is the 50th anniversary
  of the typeface, and indeed every website I look at indicate that it was designed
  in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, would anybody have the right answer, and a reliable proof
  of it?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAlice\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think the process of designing Neue Haas Grotesk (Helvetica) started in
    1953, some of the first drawings and proofs made at Haas have that year on them.
    But the commercial release of the typeface was definitely in June, 1957.
