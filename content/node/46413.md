  is a complete graphic overhaul of a tropical supermarket. And this place is reaaallllyyy
  funky cool. \r\n\r\nThe supermarket shelves are stocked with all the usual products
  you'd expect to see coming from the tropics with one very cool exception.\r\n \r\nIsles
  are stocked with flour, rice, bulk stuff like that. Then come isles of canned goods
  like vegetables, beans, etc.. And then the very next isles are stocked with, fake
  hair. Yep, hair! Black hair, brown hair, tan hair, red hair - long hair, short hair,
  curly hair, - all sorts of hair!!! And the next isles have all the products to groom
  and shape the hair! What a store!\r\n\r\nWhat type is associated with the tropics?
  \r\n\r\nThx."

    or carribean immigrants who would appreciate something more authentic?

  body: "Alesasandro, hi there. I'll post some shots in a couple of days. The store
    front windows are plastered floor to ceiling with dozens and dozens of head shots.
    Fashion photos of which have all faded.\r\n\r\nNick, thanks for the link. It gives
    me an idea of what's been used. \r\n\r\nJames, I hung out there for the entire
    day. Everybody who came into the store was black and these Canadians preferred
    to speak in their language of origin, of which I had no idea what they were saying.
    Very cool stuff indeed. \r\nI spent my time gawking at produce, looking at lables
    and soaking up colour palettes of earth tones with vibrant hues of green, yellow,
    orange, red, and blue ...and of course all that hair!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
