		<div class="commentbody">Why do you need to use FontLab? If you already have all of the weights and widths, they will show up in groups of 4 in your font menu. There is no way to get around the 4 unit family limit if that is your question. If you don't have all of the weights and widths you want, then you can't do it anyway. Even if Berthold's EULA allowed it, there is no simple way. You have to draw every letter in every weight and width.  This would take you many months if you are experienced. If you have never done it though, you are in for a real treat. It is far easier to just buy the family. Besides, Berthold's lawyers are quick to pursue infringements on their company's work.

Tiffany, 

you wrote: "If you are opening the font in Fontlab you are violating the EULA." Can you please elaborate how you arrive at this conclusion without knowing which EULA actually governs the gardenize’s license? 

The current Berthold EULA (http://www.bertholdtypes.com/info/agreement.html ) includes the following provision: <em>“YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT REVERSE ENGINEER, DECOMPILE, DECRYPT, DISASSEMBLE, NOR SEEK TO DISCOVER THE SOURCE CODE OF THE FONT SOFTWARE. (...) Notwithstanding, if applicable law in your jurisdiction permits you to decompile the Font Software, then you may only do so to achieve operability of the Font Software with another software program provided that you first request in writing that Berthold provide the information necessary to achieve such operability and Berthold has not made such information available to you subject to reasonable conditions.”</em>

However, this EULA only applies to Berthold fonts purchased from the U.S.-based Berthold Types Ltd., Berthold Direct Corp. or their distributors. It does not apply to Berthold fonts purchased from the Berlin-based H Berthold AG (which sold these fonts years ago) nor to Berthold fonts purchased from Adobe Systems (e.g. as part of the Font Folio package in versions earlier than 9, or individually when Adobe was still selling Berthold fonts in the past). Those fonts have their own EULAs that do not necessarily prohibit reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling or seeking to discover the source code of the font software. 

Furthermore, in some countries, the law permits to decompile software programs under particular circumstances. For example, Article 6 of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?val=172880:cs&lang=en&list=172880:cs,&pos=1&page=1&nbl=1&pgs=10&hwords=&checktexte=checkbox&visu=#texte">EU directive of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs (91/250/EEC)</a> permits decompilation of software programs without authorization of the rightholder for the purpose of obtaining the information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs if the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available to the licensees. Discovering the source code of computer fonts using some software tools may often be the only way to examine if a given aspect of a particular computer font (e.g. encoding, glyph naming, family naming, hinting etc.) is compatible with the particular software application we use. 

Finally, opening a computer font in a font editor such as FontLab Studio does not necessarily constitute reverse engineering, decompiling, decrypting or disassembling font software. FontLab Studio does not necessarily display the source code of a computer program included in a computer font file. For example, FontLab Studio never displays the source code of hinting, and depending on the settings, it may or may not display a decompiled code of the OpenType Layout tables. 

Therefore, I think your statement that "if you are opening the font in Fontlab you are violating the EULA" is overly simplistic and generalizing. It all depends on how you open the font (using what settings), where (geographically) you open it, when you do it and what EULA applies to the font. 

Regards,
Adam

		<div class="commentbody">I guess I should defend my position a bit more. 

In general, and including this person's request, when people are asking about reconfiguring a font and the EULA does not permit such to be done, one shouldn't do it. 

If I read your post correctly--boy I hate lawyer speak, am I alone?--then this request still isn't covered by the EU directive because they are about reconfiguring. No?

You are right though, I shouldn't generalize. I should point them to the EULA and say "good luck". ;^)

FontLab isn't the bad guy and I certainly don't mean for it to come across that way. </div>

Well, it depends what one's interpretation of "interoperability" is, doesn't it?

Again, a couple of lessons: you need to know what EULAs your fonts have attached to them, and, secondly, don't patronize foundries that seek to restrict modifications!</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">There is a difference between modification and decompilation. Just opening a font in FontLab Studio might *at most* constitute decompilation/reverse engineering. Modifying the font and generating a derivative work is a different thing. If a EULA does not permit that, you're most likely not allowed to do it. Unless of course your legislation allows you to ignore such a provision in the EULA for whatever reasons (there may be many). 

For example, in Germany, customer protection legislation allows the end-user to disregard "unreasonable" terms if the license agreement was was not made apparent to the customer in a clear way. 

For example, recently, a German court anulled a sales deal made on a website that was designed so that the button "I agree" was placed within the area that was at once visible on screen while the pricing information was placed down below so it would require the user to scroll down. 

If a font vendor does not make sure that his EULA is very apparently made part of the purchase process (so that the end-user has to notice it), then some or all terms of the EULA may end up not being binding to the user -- at least in countries that enjoy strong customer protection such as in the E.U.  

Of course, it would be up to a court to decide if a EULA clause is deemed "unreasonable" or not.

Yes, we need to vote with our currency.

And if possible, I think it nice to offer to buy fonts from small foundries from those foundries. When I need a Sumner Stone font, or Matthew Carter font, I'll always call first to see if they want put up with the bother of the sale for the slightly higher profit they'll realize. So far, Sumner & Cherie have always chosen to sell direct.

The same thinking would apply to the other small font developers  - I feel it should be their choice.  </div>
