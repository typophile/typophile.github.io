body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nthis is my first post in this interesting forum. I am now writing
  my PhD thesis and I would like to ask you for some suggestions regarding the typography
  of the document. Being a Physicist the natural tool for me for writing the thesis
  is LaTeX, unfortunately the set of default styles is limited and you see them everywhere.
  For instance some of the possibilities are inspired by \"The Elements of Typographic
  Style\" of Robert Bringhurst, that is great, but nowadays they are used by everybody.
  I would like something more original.\r\nIt is not that I pretend to create something
  as good as that style, I would like something simple but with a personality.\r\n\r\nI
  would like to use a font like Amerigo for the body fo the document, but I am not
  sure if it is good for printing. The only problem with that is that it looks like
  that there is not a SmallCaps variant of it [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/amerigo/]]
  and I would like to use it. My choice for a math font is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMS_Euler|Euler]]
  that I have see coupled with Palatino and Garamond, but I am not sure if it could
  work with Amerigo.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the combination Amerigo + Copperplate
  Gothic?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "It's nice to see a non-typophile (or maybe you are one by now :-) pay such
    attention to typography.\r\n\r\nSince Amerigo is rather high-contrast (or at least
    that the thinnest parts are very thin) its suitability will depend on the point
    size and most of all the reproduction method. For example at 12 point on a laser
    printer it might be great. One thing going against Amerigo though is that it has
    flare serifs, not full serifs. In a PhD thesis high readability is important (and
    most people agree -with good reason- that serifs help).\r\n\r\nBut as you seem
    to realize it's Euler that's going to be calling the shots* in terms of what the
    other font should be, and to me Amerigo doesn't cut it. Your safest bet is Aldus/Palatino.
    Those two are basically sisters: the former is for text, the latter for display
    - and you might try using both, with Palatino for mixing within equations (as
    they've done with \"cos\" and \"sin\" there - although I wonder why they didn't
    simply use Euler for those). But this is all too predictable...\r\n\r\n* Unless
    you can use something else - something more sober, less cursive.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    feeling up to the task you might instead look for something different that has
    everything you need - and it's possible to find serif fonts that have a subtly
    handwritten feel. What I can tell you though is that your biggest challenge will
    be getting the <em>weights</em> to harmonize: especially if the repro is high-quality
    the weights would have to be quite close to avoid a jarring effect.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your answer. My Idea was to use a main body of 10pt, so you
    suggest to avoid the Amerigo at that size.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the set of possible
    fonts with math support is somewhat limited ([[http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html]]).
    A suitable selection of fonts is:\r\n\r\nAntykwa family, but I think it is too
    fancy for a long text:\r\n<img src=\"http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/anttor/anttor.png\"
