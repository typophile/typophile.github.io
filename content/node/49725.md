body: "Hi\r\nI've been using fontographer for a decade now, been through classic,
  waiting for osx, finally osx version by FL, but what now. Should I keep waiting
  for FL to upgrade Fontographer or is it time to switch to FontLab? I know it's a
  question of taste and use, but is there hope for a Fontographer update (OT and bug
  fixes).\r\n\r\nThe reason, more people are asking for my fonts in OT format. Converting
  is an option, but creating is out with only 256 char. set in Fontographer.\r\n\r\nOr
  is this just oldskool hanging on to Fontographer?\r\n\r\nThoughts anyone?\r\n\r\nHans\r\n__________________________________\r\nIt's

  body: FontLab has been the king of font production for some time now. How long exactly?
    Four years? Five years? Maybe a lot longer than that? If I were you, I would switch.
    Upgrading won't make you a better designer by any means, but it will allow you
    to get your fonts out onto today's market much quicker.

  body: "Fontourist,\r\n\r\nI have been enjoying the best of both worlds for awhile.\r\n\r\nI
    have been using professionally Fontographer since Altsys and John Von Ehr of Texas
    created the program in the eighties. With every new version, they send out a long
    detailed questionaire and wish list, where a user could describe his peeves and
    wishes upon how to improve the program. Over 90% of my wishes were implemented,
    and I sent them many pages of details.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I upgraded to FontLab
    at the advice of Paul Nelson, formerly of the Microsoft Typography Group. Now,
    it is headed by Simon Daniels, here on Typophile.\r\n\r\nI use Fontographer for
    my creative and font editing work, and generate my end results in FontLab, as
    I find Fontographer's user interface very intuitive.\r\n\r\nCertainly, if FontLab
    would upgrade Fontographer to have OpenType support, this would be great, but
    I doubt if FontLab will invest the resources to cause users not to purchase FontLab.\r\n\r\nBtw,
    Fontographer supports Unicode and breaks the 256 character limit for a long time.
    Support though is terrible. I don't think that there is an online user group.
    \r\n\r\nSo, if you can justtify the investment, you can use both programs, or
    just patiently learn the FontLab user interface. If you are not a professional,
    and only use your font creations for personal use, you could always just continue
    using Fontographer for OSX; similarly, if you don't need OpenType or the nuances
    of recent Unicode enhancements in various foriegn languages, then you can just
    stick with Fontographer."

  body: "I think Israel Seldowitz has it about right. I too used Fontographer since
    the late 80s. It was comfortable, and still does a few things better than FontLab.
    It also had a lot of bugs we all worked around. A few years after FL came out,
    I'd do most of the work in Fontographer but run the final files through FL to
    get rid of those bugs -- & I wasn't the only one. I remember describing this at
    a meeting & seeing David Berlow's head nodding up & down . . .\r\n\r\nEventually,
    you get more comfortable with FL, & will probably use it instead of Fontographer.
    I think you will need FL to make your OpenType fonts. There are other ways, other
    programs, but if (like me) you're more \"type\" than \"computer,\" FL is probably
    the easiest route."

    a reduction when buying Fontlab if you already own Fontographer:-)\r\n\r\nOne

  body: "\r\nWe have plans to continue work on Fontographer, but we don't plan any
    immediate releases. We want to rethink the whole application from the ground up
    and create a font editor that is focused on design rather than on technical work,
    while making it still very suitable for the needs of the 21st century. \r\n\r\nBut
    this will not happen anytime real soon. We have FontLab Studio 6 in the works,
    with a much more clear release horizon (sometime within the next 10 months, I
    would say), while the Fontographer effort is more long-distance. \r\n\r\nIn the
    end, our plan is to have Fontographer as a tool that is focused on design of letterforms
    and at the same time hide all the unnecessary technical details from the user,
    while FontLab Studio will the same design tools as the new Fontographer but on
    top of that will allow people fine control over the production aspect. \r\n\r\nCertainly,
    you're not doing anything wrong by switching to FontLab Studio now. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam

  body: 'Nobody complains about Fontlab more trenchantly than me, I think I have earned
    my creds in that respect, but I resent it when people say it crashes every five
    minutes. I use it extensively on Mac and PC and find it remarkably stable. As
    with all programs, the more complex the input you throw at it, the more likely
    it is to hiccup. Those working on huge fonts might take a tip from the old days
    of word processing (the 1990s!), when we would split a complex document into 20-page
    segments and only assemble at the last possible moment, to avoid crashes. Those
    working on very complex fonts may have to adopt similar strategies. Considering
    how varied and unpredictable the input to Fontlab can be (especially when you
    consider add-ons), I''d even go so far as to say it is a remarkably stable program.
    Looking forward to a great 21st w/ Flab! '

  body: "I have not had any problems with FLS crashing related to overall VFB size,
    number of glyphs, etc. Class editing operations run incredibly slowly when kerning
    is expanded, but the app remains stable.\r\n\r\nCrashing is related to particular
    action sequences. Some of which I've so deeply suppressed that I can't remember
    what they are: I just don't do them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>It basically means: internationalization.</em>\r\n\r\nWell,

    can generate a crash pretty consistently (or at least, used to in older versions
    of FontLab). But I can work day in and day out with a 3000-glyph MM VFB without
    crashes, as well.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
