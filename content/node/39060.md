    of these are right aligned including Cambria Myriad & Consolas. Georgia is gently
    right aligned as is Gentium. Verdana seems left aligned. Palatino Courier New
    and Times seem centered. Some examples are hard to give an alignment to in some
    sense because the ogonek does not narrow. This doesn't seem right to me somehow
    but I am interested in opinion about that too. \r\n\r\nOne area of difference
    too is if the ogonek is to the right on the serif or, if the design includes one
    - the serif.\r\n\r\nThe diacritics project says <cite> Horizontally, the accent
    is never placed at the centre of the character (with the exception of \u012F /

    seems to me that the trend is to set it to the right side either gently or more

    I personally prefer to give the ogonek less weight at the top, otherwise it looks
    clunky. I like your approach with the reduced weight but I think the entire set
    of ogoneks has a bit too much variation. I agree that it may need some variation
    due to the various attachment methods, but the variation should not be so noticeable.
    Aogonek, aogonek, eogonek are optimal. In Eogonek, Uogonek, uogonek, they are
    a bit too squeezed. I'd say that in Eogonek, the bottom end should not exceed
    the right edge of E but the top end can attach a bit to the left of the edge (a
    bit like in your iogonek). I'd also try to make the attachment in Uogonek a bit
    more like in eogonek. And then, uogonek is tricky but I'd say it will survive
    if the bottom end will exceed the boundary of the u a little bit, while it would
    not be so much squeezed. And then, I'd try to make the ogoneks in Iogonek and
    iogonek a bit more squeezed to get the curvature of the ones in aogonek/eogonek
    a bit more. Simply make the ogoneks in Iogonek and iogonek the same as you have
    them in Aogonek and you'll be fine. \r\n\r\nA."

    at first which make me push it too far right for balance - which doesn't make
    it easy to follow Adam's dictum that you should not break the right edge. Part
    of what seems clever to me about Jos' design is that cutting things off early
    make s the fit/balance easier which is partly where I started to develop this
    notion from. I also think that it might survive a bitmap interpretation better.

    were too deeply curved, except the ones underneath the flat letters (iogonek,
    Iogonek). Use that structure for the remaining ones and you will be fine. In Uogonek,
    you could shift the ogonek a tad to the right so it merges with the letter really

    proportion of average lowercase letters (e.g. e or a) is a good indication. In
    other words, you can draw a rectangle around you \"a\" (the bounding box), and
    then just scale it down to fit between the baseline and the descender, and align
    it optically to the right of the letter -- and you have a reasonable proportion
    for the ogonek. When the descenders are longer than usual, the ogoneks may be
    a bit shorter, especially in display faces. Also, in rather narrow typefaces,
    the ogonek may be a bit wider in proportion than the average letter (i.e. it can

    basic shape. If the letter has traces of calligraphy, then the ogoneks should
    be integrated with the base letter as naturally as possible, and the modification
    of the original base letters shape is possible and sometimes recommended. If the
    letter is extremely typographic or even mechanical (Clarendons, FF DIN etc.),

    13.Nov.2007 9.24am) where he attached the ogonek to the end of the \"serif\".\r\n\r\nYou
    (Adam) wrote: \"I don\u2019t think putting the ogonek at the very end of a serif
    works well. Serifs are not essential skeleton elements of the letter, so it\u2019s
    logically inconsistent to attach something to them \u2014 and also, it does not
    work for me, optically. I do like Pieter\u2019s solution.\" in reply.\r\n\r\nIMHO
    you are right in your basic observation (\"serifs are not essential skeleton elements
    of the lett\" [I usually put this that way: they are not meaning-bearing elements
    of the letter, which is a similar concept; though this can shift in time]). Therefore
    ogoneks also IMHO _generally_ would not go at the end of the serifs. However in
    some cases as in (a) generally sans-serif fonts (if present: e.g. on the capital
    I) and even more so in (b) sans-serif monowidth fonts they become something hybrid...
    more than just decoration, actually, they do become part of the letters. They
    get upgraded, they appear as strong as the letter itself, usually with the same
    stroke width as horizontals in the letters generally are, and they begin to bear
    a meaning (differentiation I from l, more prominently than they do in roman serif
    fonts e.g.).\r\nA lot of people even write the capital I when standing alone WITH
    the \"serifs\" unlike any other \"regular\" serif which get lost in handwriting.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at Eben's later examples I figure that it is a sans-serif monowidth font with
    slight stroke weight alteration/dynamics and a double-storey a/g.\r\n\r\nIn this
    special case I thought it did not look wrong at the right side, as (for me) an
    ogonek is an attached character written at the end of the writing process of the
    individual letter. Of course, nonwithstanding, in roman serif fonts the attachment
    point for the iogonek would be more or less centered, as the serifs in that style
    are superimposed decorational elements.\r\n\r\n"

    biggest problem I have is how to add the ogonek to my \"blackletter\" serif of
    \"a\".\r\nUsing the same template as for the rest of glyphs I would get a \"big
    black ink dot\" at the end of aogonek. I am not sure of my decision. Maybe I should
    redraw all ogoneks as it is in [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_scala_sans_pro_regular/|Scala
    Sans]] (more vertical beginning)?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "In some typefaces, there is a problem of the narrow space in aogonek and
    uogonek between the curve that joins the stem and the ogonek. Take FF Meta as
    an example. In such cases, I would not be afraid of opening the space up from
    _both_ sides, i.e. modifying the curve of the letter in aogonek and uogonek as
    much as the curve of the ogonek itself. In other words, the shape of the original
    \"a\" does not always have to be identical to the shape of the \"a\" part in aogonek.
    \r\n\r\nTake a look at the attached picture (scroll right to see the wireframe
    outline comparison):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ogonekopen_3850.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote,
    I'm not saying that my quickly drawn ogonek shape is the best solution of FF Meta
    (though certainly better than what is included in FF Meta Pro). The main point
    I'm making is that I've moved the curve of the \"a\" part upwards. Think of it
    as creating an ink trap of some sort, just like you would in any other such situation.
    \r\n\r\nAlso note that in some cases, you may choose to remodel the outer (right)
    part of the a-ogonek junction as I did, so it joins smoothly. Just popping on
    a composite ogonek wouldn't do it justice, really. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    Ogoneks describe \"nasality\" (\u0105 sounds like the end of french <em>mon</em>
    and \u0119 like the middle of <em>cinq</em>. It is even not possible to spell
    eg \"\u0105\u0105\" easily. More: none polish word begins with Aogonek nor Eogonek."

    It is very helpful to know this kind of information when kerning. Not just in
    Polish, but all languages. I have a particular need with the dcaron, lcaron, tcaron
    abutting other diacritic glyphs. How often do such collisions occur in real use
    and what are the common combinations?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I was making a list of tasks yesterday and I started to get distracted by
    drawing an aogonek next to other glyphs to see what I thought the impacts/interactions,
    if any might be. The a seemed like to most likely because The letters I thought
    about were g,j,y. The q's descender is too far to worry about. agonek and uogonek
    with g & y seem like the most likely to interact. But looking at Adams designs
    I see that you can and probably should work around that with a better/more robust
    design instead. Maybe there might be subtle color/eveness issues that might be
    addressed with a CALT though. untimately I have to learn more about common patterns
    of use as Chris suggests.

    starts a word in Polish so kerning pairs like \u0104w are nonsense. But typically,
    you'd use \u0104 as a dependent kerning glyph in a class driven by the A glyph,
    so the overhead of Aw -> \u0104w is minimal. Except, of course, you expand the
    class pairs and generate pure singleton pair-based kerning, say, for a Type 1
    CE-encoded font. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
