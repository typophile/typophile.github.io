body: "I just have this sketch to go on, but it gives me a pretty good idea of what
  I'm looking for.... and yet I wasn't able to find anything. It's a serif font (obviously)
  with very strong contrast that my bud who drew it and I'm volunteering to make something
  up for thought was akin to a tattoo kind of face, though none of what I looked for
  under that heading was much like it at all. Note that it has that \"barb\" halfway
  down on all of the letters. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm really hoping for is something free...
  as I'm not getting paid for this little project where I'm using it... and if possible,
  something that has a few different weights. Beyond that I'm also hoping that the
  contrast isn't too extreme as it may be reproduced pretty small and I don't want
  the thin parts to wash out. I do realize that the sketch here is quite vague and
  so I'm just looking for options that might be in the ballpark.  \r\n\r\nI realize
  that this all is asking a lot... but miracles DO happen, right?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance for the benefit of your expertise....\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brett-font_5474.jpg]"
