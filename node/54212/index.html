  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm putting my thoughts together for the logo for a software product called "Pingstrom". The name is play off the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom|Ångström]] word, which is metric unit equal to 1/10 of a nanometer. 

The software deals with (computer) network measurement, which primarily revolves around a technique called 'pinging' - repeatedly sending small pieces of data to the target computer and then expecting the target to return this data back. Think submarine sonar pings for a more conventional analogy.

In any case, I'd like to get a general idea if either of the following concepts is worth pursuing. Serifed type is used to try and capture the precision aspect of the software, which is implied by the angstrom reference.

(A) This on is a straight forward reference to Ångström. It also maps nicely to a small application icon, which is obviously pretty important.

(B) This one tries to capture the nature of the actual pinging process.

Also, tangentially related, can you guys tell me if it's easy to read the following as a <em>ping</em> ? 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ping_4787.png]

Reason I'm asking is that some people read π as 'pie' and some - as 'pee', so I'm curious what the ratio is. I'm playing with the idea of pairing Pi and the ring and not sure if it's going to be too obscure.</div>

I think your other two ideas so far are more "universally legible" (and interesting).</div>

@lex: I agree, it is. However I'm having trouble reconciling the presence of both the ring and the umlauts in the same word. The closest I got so far is the following, but the ring seems to be kind of sticking out, don't you think ?

I'm not saying you should copy that logo, but I think you're making too much fuzz about something that may not be that important and may get removed completely later in the process.

You can try positioning those dots a bit higher so they don't look like parts of letters. You can use a combination of dots and circles... like OK pings and failed ones... All I'm saying is play with dots if you want to have them. Just don't play with letters and dots and change meaning and diminish dot meaning...

@christian: I made a quick attempt building the dot/ring into the P and it looked quite a bit quirky. I'll give it another try and see how ö's dots look when treated the same way. Thanks for the idea. 

Also, there is a Unicode symbol for Å, it's 0197 (C5 in hex). Pretty much any decent font has it.
 
@litera: The reasoning behind the dot business is like this - the O needs dots and the A needs a ring to re-enforce the Ångström reference. That's a starting point. Having both the ring and the dots looks strange, so the natural tweak is to use a dot for P (since P-ringed is a made-up symbol anyhow). Also, the dot over P creates a mild visual annoyance, since the dot would've been more appropriate over the I, and this may make the logo more memorable.

Additionally, the logo needs to have a smaller, "built-in" mark that can work on its own as an application icon. P alone won't work for a number of reasons, but P+dot/ring could do it. 

--

To move away from the dots and rings, how does this one look to you, guys ? Just ignore the rendering/kerning issues for now. 

The concept is that of a [[http://www.chinalabsupplies.com/G84.JPG|micrometer caliper]] used to measure one item in a stream of network packets. Pending any collisions with existing logos, I think the concept is pretty solid. Thoughts, comments ?

		<div class="commentbody">epsilicon, Have you considered simply creating a nice type design and pairing it with a mark? It looks as though you are forcing ideas into the lettering which can give the company a kind of scattered and frenetic feel as opposed to a solid and decided stance. I like the type you are working with (except the S looks fuzzy and slants strangely). What about placing the 3 dots together in the form of a triangle on the side with nice color and typography and a well considered strap line. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">@speter: In principle I agree that P-ring has more potential. However this is the software logo, and so it comes with some unique restrictions, both visual and geometric. Latter are especially nasty. The mark needs to fill a square shape more or less evenly and it needs to scale down to 16 x 16 px size (which is one of the reasons why the <em>ring</em> is not really an option, but, for example, the dot is).

Shari, thanks for the insight. I have shelved the idea of a wordmark and instead I am now looking at the exact option you described. Using the "Micrometer P" from my previous post as the mark.

Incidentally the three dot mark I cannot do, because I used it with one of my previous projects and consequently sold the whole thing, artwork and copyrights included.
