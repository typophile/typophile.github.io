  body: 'Its narrow, which I like, but it misses some of those square arms and beaks.
    Im a fan of chevin which is away from T-star but I''ve used in my final major
    and can''t really see it washing on my site. '

  body: Have you thought about Helvetica or Tahoma ?! They are both narrow and also
    have the arms and beaks you are looking for...if all else fails i suggest using
    comic sans? easy, simple and always very effective!

    Palatino?\r\nAnd dont get smart - you havent even graduated yet you mug..."

    prick who has probably downloaded a stupid amount of fonts and worked your way
    through them memorizing the names...at least my fonts are proven to work...stick
    to Miso mate and watch the big fat 3rd appear on your degree....complete tosser...
