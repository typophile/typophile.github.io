  of this logo type. Can you tell what the company's name is? We were going for a
  unique logotype using familiar letter forms. The base typeface is a helvetica."

  body: "Way too much going on for my taste. For two, the am ligature feels forced,
    a completely artificial construct. Either the pf ligature or the custom /t/ would've
    been enough IMO. \r\n\r\nShading is nice, but it is quickly becoming a cliche...
    at least judging how every second type-based logo on Dribbble appears to be using
    it now."

  body: "there's too much going on. I think the last is best, as it's simplest, but
    the p/f is still a bit too easy to interpret as different letters, IMHO (r, s,
    d, etc.)\r\n\r\nIt's definitely going to be a challenge as there is no real natural
    way to make a ligature out of a p and f. \r\n\r\nIt may be too simple or cliche
    of an idea, but what if you actually stepped the type? set 'frame' on a baseline
    a tad higher than 'step'?"

  body: I liked number 3 from a previous iteration. I think it's important to have
    the the main line extend, otherwise it just looks like an r. I don't think it
    has too much going on, I like it! :)

    are a few helvetica / din crossovers. Or maybe even go further. I would like riccard0's
    afrobeat with a little bit of tinkering.\r\n\r\nYou've got to find a way to make
    the curves look more natural."

  body: "Of the last three you showed I like #3 the most.\r\nHere's the thing. You've
    done a great job so far, so if you'd stick with v1 it would be almost ok to just
    use that. But it's true it needs some work done. So even though people have provided
    their <em>negative</em> input, I'm sure they have positive one as well. Don't
    get dishearted by it.\r\n\r\nBut. To continue on the #3. If all the letters are
    connected, why are you disconnecting /p/ and /f/ then? I know it could have legibility
    problems, but you could try doing something in that regard.\r\n\r\n@LumaVine:
    although an interesting concept, it doesn't work too good because all things being
    equal all letters are round-shaped and this <em>step F</em> is completely square-ish.
    That's why it doesn't goo too well with the rest of lettering. I know it's just
    an idea and I'm saying it's a good one, but it needs a lot of work if it might
    go further..."

  body: "I agree with litera here, #3 is the best in my opinion. I would join the
    upper stroke of the P to join the F and leave the other gap and see if the legibility
    is ok. \r\nAlso I'll tweak the ligature you've created for the a & the m. Maybe
    it's too wide, not sure what it is but it doesn't work for me.\r\nIt would help
    a bit of context so we know what this logo is for. \r\n\r\nKeep the good job,
    looks great!\r\n\r\nIrene"
