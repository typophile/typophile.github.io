  anyone figure out the logic behind the page construction?\r\nPage size is A4 (210
  \xD7 297 mm) and the grid is 468 \xD7 657 pt (Didot points \u2013 0.376 mm; 175.968
  \xD7 247.032 mm).\r\nI've been trying to reconstruct it in Illustrator from the
  actual book measurements and the only thing that I got so far is that you\u2019ll
  get the golden section where the line going through the lower right corners of paper
  and text block intersects the upper edge of the paper."

  body: "The grid is described inside, pages 87 to 95. \r\n\r\nThe units of measurement
    used to calculate the positions on the grid are ciceros, as shown 0n page 88.
    I'm not seeing a Golden Section formatting, but you are right about the positioning
    of the text block relative to the page. The oblique axis going from the bottom
    of the inner edge to the outside top intersects the top outer corner and bottom
    inner corner of the text block.\r\n\r\nThe text block is 39 ciceros wide and 54
    cic 9 deep.\r\nThe column widths are 9 ciceros wide, the horizontal space between
    the columns is 12 didot points;\r\nThe vertical cells are 5 cic 9; the vertical
    spacing between the cells is 15 didot points.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the system. But
    is it the logic?\r\n\r\nIt could be that the vertical arithmetic is premised on
    the depth given by the diagnol for a 39 ciceros wide block."

  body: I knew about the size of the text block; I have the book. But the positioning
    isn't mentioned anywhere.
