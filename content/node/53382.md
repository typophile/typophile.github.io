    OTF file is not a font family, it's a single font.\r\n\r\nThere is a small workaround
    for 'family-aware' fonts, with the 'size' feature, but that has been poorly constructed
    and has led to errors in the past. Besides, no application supports it (perhaps
    InDesign CS4 does). Besides #2, you cannot add it with FontLab, you would need
    ADFKO for that.\r\n\r\n<cite>ps. what unicodes do i use for alternate characters?</cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    may think of anything. A rule of thumb I have seen in Adobe fonts is to let the
    user choose between selecting an alternate for a character (such as ornaments
    found under the bullet), and have it as alternate for 'regular' characters (i.e.,
    'A' is ornament #1, 'B' for ornament #2), but that option seems to be outdated
    already.\r\n\r\nUsing Unicodes in the private area would be okay, I guess."

    got seperate fontlab files for regular/bold, but how do i combine them into one
    .otf?</em>\r\n\r\nAs Theunis points out, you can't make a single OTF file with
    several fonts in it, but, depending on the way you set up the name fields in your
    fonts, you can create associations between them so they show up in programs as
    one family. (See [[Font Naming]] in the TypoWiki.)\r\n\r\n<em>follow-up question:
    in file menu, what\u2019s the difference between\r\n\u2013 generate font\r\n\u2013
    generate all\r\n\u2013 generate suitcase\r\n?</em>\r\n\r\nGenerate Font: Generates
    a single TTF or OTF font file. (Some other formats, too, but mainly it's used
    for those.)\r\n\r\nGenerate All: Same as Generate Font, except for multiple fonts
    at one time. Can include all fonts that are open in FontLab or just some of them.\r\n\r\nGenerate
    Suitcase: For making old style Mac PostScript and TrueType fonts. These only work
    on Macs.\r\n\r\n<em>ps. what unicodes do i use for alternate characters?</em>\r\n\r\nThese
    should either be left unencoded (no Unicode number) or given Private Use Area
    (E000-F8FF) codes. There are no standards for this area by definition, so you
    can use them any way you want. They will be unlikely to match glyphs in other
    fonts that use the PUA, but that's the nature of PUA. Adobe and other recommend
    not encoding alternate characters, but there are some reasons for doing so."

    thanks for the link\r\n\r\nbut i still don't understand about alternate unicodes

    feature for that, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#8.a\">see
    here</a> for an example of the required feature code.\r\n"

  body: "<cite>... if it\u2019s un-coded ...</cite>\r\n\r\nIn addition to Jens, OpenType
    features are not Unicode dependent; they work with 'raw glyphs' instead. But assigning
    Unicodes to the alternates has the advantage they are visible and can be entered
    into non-OpenType aware applications. Also, you can use Unicode characters in
    the InDesign Search & Replace fields, but non-encoded glyphs have to be searched
    and replaced with the Search For Glyphs (CS3+) function (which does that and nothing
    more).\r\n\r\n<cite>Adobe and other recommend not encoding alternate characters,
    but there are some reasons for doing so.</cite>\r\n\r\nFont switching is one,
    but it's hardly a valid point if you're talking about manually selected alternates.
    Any more? I remember the original Adobe specification of assigning 'regular' characters
    to ornaments using aalt (? memory) was removed somewhere in time."

  body: Another good reason not to do this is that the normal "bold" and "italic"
    from style menus or buttons would not work with it. Also, support for Stylistic
    Sets is rather lacking at this time, unfortunately.
