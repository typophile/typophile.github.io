body: I'd like to introduce Flat Sans, a humanist grotesque type family from Schizotype
  Fonts. Available now from  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/flat-sans/|MyFonts]]
  and  [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/schizotype/flat-sans|Fontspring]], and currently
  stupidly discounted (if you can't beat 'em, join 'em!)

  body: I'm defintely looking at buying this. A versatile, fully-featured, all-weight,
    friendly humanist sans that seems solidly made for a good price. Would work for
    most applications.

  body: "I'm sure it will be! I have a non-profit I do a bunch of workfor that's previously
    used Proxima Nova as their main font, and this has some similar proportions while
    being more humanist in construction, which I really like.\r\n\r\nPS. Love those
    steep, prominent accents."
