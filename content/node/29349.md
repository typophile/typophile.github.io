body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a legible body text typeface that goes well with
  <a href=http://www.kontrapunkt.dk/news/ddprize_typeface_of_the_year_2004>Kontrapunkt</a>
  as headings. The subject is about technology (modern \"green\" engines) so that's
  why Kontrapunkt. I considered the font for body text as well but it would be too
  much for 60 pages of text :)\r\nI'm looking for a typeface with modern technical
  feel, yet easy-to-read. Thanks.\r\n\r\nalex"

  body: "What do you think of <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless/styles>Stainless</a>
    from [[Font Bureau]]? I think it should work:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kontrapunkt-stainless_6613.jpg]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I'm not sure wheter to choose the Light or Ultra Light version.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody
    have those weights and could generate a PDF with few lines filled with \"lorem
    ipsum\" or sth similar? I'd like to check this precisely. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n_______\r\nAL\r\n<a

  body: "Alek (if I may)\r\n\r\nI think the top of the two is working best. The head
    seems to match too well, if you follow me, and there isn't enough contrast. I
    wonder if the body couldn't be a hair smaller to create a little contrast. I'd
    also tighten the word spacing a bit."

    already is. What is the point if not to contrast, at least a little, from the
    head. I wouldn''t use Cholla because it is too similar. But that''s just me. '

  body: Something here that relates by its contrast might be good. There was a list
    of Meta-mimics (What I'm now calling a new category of Information Sans), some
    of which are square enough, yet well-spaced enough, to work for a text this long.
    I think something square and moderately condensed would be sympathetic with the
    square, yet wide, shapes of Kontrapunkt. Zemestro, Cachet, something like that.
    I like Stainless a lot, but it has a lot of flavor as well; might be too showy.

  body: "Tiffany, sure you can, however, Polish short version of Aleksander is Olek
    (Alek is a different name - strange, I know) :) \r\n\r\nThe publication body text
    will be set in 8 or 9 pts so the sample shown above is only for showing similarities
    of typefaces. I agree on bigger contrast in size between headings and body - Kontrapunkt
    works well when big.\r\n\r\nI considered Cholla as a body, but I think it's too
    competitive to Kontrapunkt and doesn't work well as big amount of text.\r\n\r\nAs
    for condensed version, Carl, I also considered that but Stainless' version is
    a bit too condensed. Zemestro is nice - I need to take a closer look.\r\n\r\nThanks
