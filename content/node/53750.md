  body: "I love the Narrow! Think it's nicer than the original. \r\n\r\nI haven't
    worked out how much all 66 cost.\r\n\r\n... I have now! I'll have to start saving.\r\n\r\n<cite>
    The prospect of a \"Gotham for embroidery\" collection and a \"Gotham for box
    scores\" was daunting, and ran counter to one of H&FJ's core philosophies: that
    type families should be as small as possible, but as large as necessary.</cite>\r\n\r\nIs
    66 really as small as possible?\r\n"
