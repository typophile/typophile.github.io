    mind; the font is Egmont, probably the regular version. It is available here:

    body: Hmm I don't think its Egmont. The W is a dead giveaway. Egmont is close
      so it might be my best bet. The book was published in 1993.

  body: "Good find George. The sample in the book is indeed a match for Egmont by
    Hendrik de Roos. Note that the w and W in the Ortiz-Lopez version are different.
    There are a few other differences such as the slope of the terminal on r. But
    these are minor. Most people would not notice them.\r\nDon "

  body: Anything that came from OptiFonts (Castcraft, Neon Type, Type Films of Chicago,
    Pirates of the Frozen North, whatever...) was a ripoff of something else. Their
    "work" certainly wasn't anything anyone else would copy.

  body: "Good find nicholas. \r\nI still say it's Egmont by S. H. de Roos. Produced
    for Amsterdam Foundry in 1933. Intertype version 1937.  For full character set
    see Jaspert's Type Encylopaedia, 1970. \r\nOPTI was a notorious font pirate and
    sold fonts by other fontmakers, usually after changing the name. However OPTI
    digitized some fonts on its own. This seems to be the case with Eisen, which is
    the OPTI digitization of Egmont. I did not spot any significant differences between
    Eisen and the Egmont original.  Eisen has a copyright claim of 1990-91. I suggest
    that the book could have been produced from the Egmont metal type, a photo type
    version, or the OPTI version.\r\nDe Roos also produced an attractive inline version
    of the capitals. Not digitized.\r\nDon"

    body: "Thanks Don. I think whats throwing me off is the capital W. Honestly Eisen's
      capital W looks much nicer than Egmonts. Here is a screenshot with the W from
      Eisen on the left. I think my safest bet is to stick with Egmont regardless
      but I wish that W was better. :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EgEis_4119.jpg]"

  body: "Most but not all OPTI fonts were pirated from digital fonts made by others.\r\nUnless
    we have information that someone else digitized Egmont before OPTI, it is reasonable
    to conclude that it is an original work.\r\nUnfortunately ALL OPTI fonts are legal
    orphans. Using an OPTI font, pirated OR original, in a commercial venture is something
    I would not do unless I had reasonable assurances from good legal counsel.\r\nDon"

  body: Don, as with any other font that originated in Chicago or Skokie, it's wise
    to be cautious. The family is still in business (signs) and they may still own
    the IP rights.

  body: "I agree George. That's why I recommended good legal counsel before using
    any OPTI fonts. Who owns the IP rights is a good question. It would probably be
    cheaper to make a new font from the original de Roos' design than to enter the
    legal jungle of using an OPTI font. Another possibility is to ask Ortiz-Lopez
    for permission to modify his version.\r\nDon"

    Eisen is a copy of Egmont so it makes sense that they are so similar. [corrected]\r\n\r\nhttp://opti.netii.net/fonts-e/index.htm\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you guys think?"
