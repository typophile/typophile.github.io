body: "Back in the early 1990s I had a customer and I did just that for them. Created
  fonts out of their logos for them to use on their mechanicals.\r\n\r\nToday, I have
  been asked (after all these years of no communication) if I could do it again for
  them. \r\n\r\nMost of the logos are not a problem, very simple. However, one that
  was a killer then - is back with an additional S on the end of it. (They decided
  it should be a plural and opposed to the singular version.) That one had three layers,
  4 key strokes for each layer, and then I was kind enough to put it all together
  for them so they could color each layer separately. \r\n\r\nI don't have the recall
  or strength to do it again - please contact me if you do, if you want to see it,
  and if you want to estimate what you'd like for doing it.\r\n\r\nWaiting to hear
  from you.\r\n\r\nJackie"

    me through here. I'd like to pass your name on to the person who needs this project
    done.\r\n\r\nI just can't seem to make fonts anymore - I guess I don't like drawing
    upon bitmap images... been too long a time.\r\n\r\nThank you."
