body: "Hi. I'm looking for a condensed sans serif that comes in a decent set of weights
  including a light. I want something that has the formal structure of, say, Akzidenz
  or Univers but with slightly rounded edges. I don't mean something explicitly rounded,
  just a softer more 'modern' edge.\r\n\r\nVillage's <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Lux/Section/mudTyper+Weights/\">Section</a>
  is quite good but more condensed would be nice...\r\n\r\nAny tips greatly appreciated."

    too, but it's not very soft.

  body: And there's the recently popular <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.117386.0.0">Neo
    Sans</a>, but it's no more condensed than Section.
