body: "I was just flipping through Slashdot, and I came upon an <a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/17/2118203\">interesting
  article</a> about the flaws of using a free typeface under the GNU Public License,
  or GPL. It appears that embedding one of those typefaces into any document makes
  it subject to the GPL. \r\n\r\nSome of the comments were particularly interesting
  such as this one:\r\n\r\n<code>by dr.badass (25287)  on Sunday April 17, @11:04PM
  (#12266364)\r\nI have to agree, the largest failing of Linux (and Java for that
  matter) is a good set of fonts. Why not make a bunch of truely Public Domain fonts
  so everyone can use them?</code>\r\n\r\n<code>There are plenty of public domain
  faces out on the web, but they're mostly of the novelty variety, and aren't really
  terribly relevant. Excepting them, here is why this hasn't happened yet:</code>\r\n\r\n<code>1)
  Good type design is pretty hard.\r\n2) Good type design for all-purpose screen fonts
  is really hard.\r\n3) Tools are either expensive or crap.\r\n4) Good type designers
  cost money.\r\n5) There just isn't much incentive.\r\n6) Open source community attitude
  toward design issues generally sucks.</code>\r\n\r\n<code>It's a good idea, but
  the people to convince are professional type designers and foundries. Bitstream
  Vera is a (the only?) example I can think of like this, though it's merely under
  \"generous copyright\".</code>\r\n"

  body: Most GPL fonts are actually released under a modified GPL that has a specific
    "embedding exception." Sorry not to have a link for this. There's a great deal
    of misinformation and underinformed speculation out there, so I'd take just about
    everything you hear with a grain of salt.

  body: "Fonts occupy a strange place between software and graphics; Misunderstanding
    about how they actually work is rampant. I offered a number of fonts that I'd
    designed (and packaged) to Debian five or six years ago -- I even offered to license
    them under the GPL, unmodified.  The only thing that came of it was a heated discussion
    among the Debian developers over whether TTF or PFB files counted as source code
    or binary.\r\n\r\nThat said, the situation on Xorg has gotten much better lately,
    with the excellent rasterizing by [[Pango]]/XFT/Cairo (not sure exactly which
    one does the heavy lifting) under GTK.  In my opinion, fonts render better on
    Xorg than in OSX or Windows. And a number of international fonts, in addition
    to the Bitstream Vera family, are included by default, at least under Debian and
    Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nThe [[FontForge]] home page lists a number of open-source font
    development projects: http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/index.html#font-devel\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I kinda understood the modified GPL stuff, but it was the variety of comments
    and the knowledge/lack of knowledge of the various people that was the most interesting.
    The comment that I posted above was very insightful, almost to the point that
    it might have been made by a type designer himself.

  body: XORG also has Adobe Utopia and Bitstream Charter, which is absolutely amazing
    to me. Add those to Bitstream Vera, and you almost have all you need to publish.
    I haven't heard of Pango before. I'm not much of a command line commando to put
    anything to use, but it's interesting to know what's going on.
