  body: "That's an interesting service: Take the pain out of parenting!\r\n\r\nI agree
    with you; Welcome Home sounds better than Welcome Baby. But probably there is
    a risk of that being a little generic. Why not Baby's Day In ;)\r\n\r\nFor the
    logo, nice choice of typeface. Somehow the very first option - without any modification
    - looks the best of the lot. If you want to have the loop device, perhaps you
    cold think of a way of integrating it with the tagline.\r\n\r\nAlso it may be
    an idea to tweak the small-caps height a little. Probably 80-85% of cap height.\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n> A bit like some of the C/o ligatures shown on this thread:\r\n> http://typophile.com/node/39183\r\n\r\nInteresting...
    And I think it would support the idea of the company... which is to provide support.
    I will try this out..\r\n\r\nThe company is also considering a division that would
    work in the same way for elder care. Again, helping to come over and clean, do
    laundry, do errands, etc. So I dont want to play up the Mother/Child connection
    as I would like to play up the ideas of care and support. Not sure what the tag
    line will be for that division..."

  body: "Going to second Welcome Home over Welcome Baby.\r\n\r\nWelcome Home gives
    the feel that someone is already there doing things to help you out and take care
    of you. \"We'll support you while you support your [new] baby\"\r\n\r\nWelcome
    Baby is more suited to greeting cards or baby shower banners\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the
    elderly servive maybe also consider companionship/company. I think a lot of elderly
    are capable but aren't as independant anymore and get lonely since they may not
    be able to drive or get around that easily. They might also be sensitive about
    needing help"

  body: "In 1, the way the R cradles the O serves your theme best, but repeating it
    with the sharp-cornered E in \"care\" fails; it draws attention away from the
    RO, which if allowed to stand alone as the focus of the logo would evoke quite
    well what Satya is on about. Perhaps you could even make the O somewhat larger
    to make it more clear.\r\n\r\nOf the the designs given, I think you can eliminate
    2, in which the swash wanders toward then away from the tagline, 3, in which it
    wanders away before coming back, and 4, in which it just leads away from the whole
    thing. These all have an undertone of inattention, which you certainly don't want.
    5 is the most aesthetically pleasing in that regard, as it leads directly to the
    tagline just as you would hope the attendant would run straight to the baby when
    it needs something."
