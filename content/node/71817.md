body: "I am building a booklet at work and am having fits getting my pagination the
  way I would like it. \r\n\r\nI am working in InDesign CS3. I have applied special
  character page numbers to the A-Master pages. I have applied a separate master page
  to the front and back cover, so they are not counted in the pagination.\r\n\r\nAfter
  the cover, the first two pages (the first spread) of the booklet is the table of
  contents. I want the pagination to begin on the page after the table of contents.
  So, I have applied the table of contents pages to the same master page as the cover.
  The page numbering begins on the page after the table of contents. This is all good.\r\n\r\nMy
  problem is this: When the page numbers actually start, they start with the number
  \"4\" instead of the number \"1.\" In essence, I would like page 1 to start on what
  is actually page 4 of the document. But I can't seem to find the function for this.\r\n\r\nI
  hope I explained that clearly. I'm sure it could be more concise, my apologies!
  Does anyone have a solution for this? Save going in and editing each page number
  manually?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As Frode said.\r\n\r\nYou might also consider starting \"1\" on a recto (right
    hand page). It's traditional that even numbers are on the left hand page, odd
    numbers on the right. If the contents is on a recto (say page iii), let page iv
    be blank and begin your text (page 1) on the facing page. Alternatively, if you
    can't afford a blank, start the very first page as Arabic 1 -- no law about beginning
    with Roman numerals."
