body: Hi all! I&#39;m working on this logo, and was wondering what you thought. One
  element I would like to incorporate is to link two letters together with a stroke
  or some other element, but the name of the company doesn&#39;t lend itself to this
  kind of treatment. If you have any ideas that would be greatly appreciated.  <BR>
  <BR>I have a feeling someone will cringe at the use of Helvetica Neue, but I don&#39;t
  have a very large type selection. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>t1mmy<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12225.gif"

  body: Personally I like Helvetica. I would choose the upper one. Maybe you could
    leave more space between the words and the vertical line. And I think the space
    between L. and STEPHENSON should be adjusted manually, otherwise the gap might
    be too wide.

  body: I like Helvetica Neue, the top logo is my favorite, I would however suggest
    moving the &#40;stranded&#41;  &#34;L&#34; a bit close to the rest. If you are
    going simply with a typographic identity, change something to make it more unique
    especially if using a common &#40;but nice&#41; font like Helvetica. In the end
    all that matters is what the client chooses, and since he/she chose the bottom
    version I would still suggest doing something about the stranded L.
