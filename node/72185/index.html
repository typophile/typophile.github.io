  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have an imac running mac Tigar 10.4.11.
I know it has been hot this past few weeks in New York but I don&rsquo;t think that is why my computer asks me to restart it 1 or 2 times a week. I get the transparent curtain that comes down the screen and then the pop up box that says &ldquo;You need to restart your computer&rdquo; 
I dump the trash often and have about 3.75 gb being used right now. The processor is 2hz and the intel core duo. The memory is 1gb 667 mhz ddr2&hellip;..
Does anyone know why the computer is making me restart it 1 or 2 times a week like this. Could it be dying :(

		<div class="commentbody">This could be a lot of things. The OS install could be corrupt, you could have corrupt software, bad RAM, maybe even a bad CPU. You need to get everything important backed up ASAP and either get the computer serviced. The iMac isn’t designed with service in mind, so personally I would just test the RAM, reinstall the OS, and then give up and buy a cheap PC to run Hackintosh on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The technical term for that is a &ldquo;kernel panic&rdquo;. Can be caused by hardware problems (a loose RAM chip, for example) or by software problems.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean a serious problem &ndash; I&rsquo;ve had them once or twice over the years and yet my Mac continued working fine once restarted. But if they start happening frequently you need to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The heat shortens the lifetime of cheap electrolytic capacitors. Checking, whether some of them are burst, is the first thing, I do, when I have suddenly problems with a computer, on which I have not installed anything new. (If the capacitors are damaged, you can solder them out and exchange them with new [and better] ones. But that is not easy.)</p>
<p>The potential  transformers of the mainboard (cold start problems) and the power supply unit are likewise often reasons for sudden crashes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uh, you shouldn&rsquo;t leave your computer on without restarting that much.</p>
<p>Rebooting a computer clears the RAM (random access memory). When you open/close programs, small portions of the RAM (you don&rsquo;t really have very much to begin with) are taken up, thus slowing down your computer&rsquo;s ability to access information and execute tasks.</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s not saying why you need to restart doesn&rsquo;t help at all&hellip; if it were a loose RAM stick, I&rsquo;d be surprised that your computer would boot in the first place.</p>
<p>Try reinstalling your OS, maybe?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok few things to do first,</p>
<p>Is the computer still in warranty, if yes don&rsquo;t take it apart and defiantly don&rsquo;t solder or repair any internals, just call up apple care and book it in for a repair. IF you didn&rsquo;t buy Apple care you still can if your machine is less than 1 year old.</p>
<p>Then try these</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out the apple forums for similar problems with your system, your probably nto the only one who has had this issue and there may well be  a fix on there.</li>
<li>Download ONYX (<a href="http://www.titanium.free.fr">www.titanium.free.fr</a>) and run its automated services (this runs a whole host of Unix repair stuff as well as the apple maintenance routines)</li>
<li>Download any updates
4  Run ONYX again.</li>
<li>Start up in safe mode and run fdisk see here for a how to - <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1417">http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1417</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If its still having a kernel Panic take out any third party ram and restart (Macs are picky when it comes to RAM)</p>
<p>As a final resort pop in your tiger disc and do a reinstall.</p>
<p>IF all that fails take it to a Genuis bar and have them look at it, they&rsquo;ll look at it free and give you an estimate for a repair.</p>
<p>Looking at your specs you really want to increase your ram to 2 or above this will give your whole system a boost and is cheap, don&rsquo;t buy the Ram from Apple (unless your feeling flush) buy from someone like Crucial.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Use Disk Utility: found in Apps/Utilities/Disk Utility. Select your volume, run the Repair permissions function, give it a while and it should clean up things fairly well if there are any problems. Always run this after an install of any kind just to clear and tidy things up. Bad/wrong permissions can do strange things to the system.</p>
<p>Also, very helpful is the fsck command. At start up, hold Apple-S (before the start up spinner appears) and you&rsquo;ll get into single-user mode where you can run Unix commands. Type fsck - f (it means file system check; be sure to put the space between the k and dash) and it&rsquo;ll run a check on the volume catalogue and bitmaps and repair most issues. It&rsquo;s all built-in functionality and I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with it in the years I&rsquo;ve used it.</p>
<p>One other self-maintenance thing OS X does (as I understand it) is in the wee hours of the morning it&rsquo;ll run a check on itself and repair any issues it can automatically. Just set  you computer to not sleep for the night and should work on its own.</p>
