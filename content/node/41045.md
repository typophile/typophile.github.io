body: "I make handmade books. I make the paper and do all the binding by hand. I do
  not do this professionally, and I have figured out ways around investing in expensive
  equipment to letter the spines. I need advice on purchasing an inkjet printer so
  I can print, mostly text and line illustrations, on my handmade paper. I will be
  printing PDF files, so as I understand it, crisp text will not be a problem with
  higher-resolution (1200 dpi) printers. I don't want to use a laser printer because
  ink lasts longer.\r\n\r\nHere are my requirements:\r\n\r\n1200 dpi or higher\r\nReasonably
  high-quality text\r\nDecent speed (1 or 2 pages a minute is fine)\r\nPrints on custom
  paper sizes up to 11x17 (or 12x18)\r\nPrints on art/handmade paper\r\nPrints 4-color,
  though I will mostly be printing black or brown text, and some secondary colors
  (like red or green)\r\nCosts under $500 (but will spend more if someone thinks it
  is necessary or worth it to do so)\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice you can give!"

    of course, but I need to be able to line up both sides.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I strongly suspect that you'll have great difficulty finding any inkjet printer
    that can handle art/handmade paper (though probably easier than finding a laser
    printer to do the same). IF you could find one, you'd find that the absorbency
    characteristics of art/handmade paper would be truly awful for inkjet printing
    - the bleed would be just enormous.\r\n\r\nNow, if you *want* an overinked letterpress
    look to your printing, maybe you won't mind that last point. But I suspect you
    wouldn't find the particular style of ink spread very lovable (major \"wicking\"
    along fibers of the paper). But in any case I'll bet you won't find an inkjet
    that can physically handle such paper, anyway.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could be wrong,
    and it may very well be that there is/are some specialty inkjets just for this
    purpose. I just haven't heard of them.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I'm still using an Epson 3000, and have run rolls of  [[http://www.inkjetart.com/wc/illuminata/|Illuminata]]
    paper through. If you get a paper that has been treated to work on inkjet the
    problems Thomas mentions will be minimized if not eliminated. If I tell my rip
    what paper I'm using and set my profiles right the text is not far off a coated
    paper.\r\n\r\nWhat I was never able to overcome was the tendency of the printer
    to distort the length of the document. Something about the thickness of the paper
    and weight would throw the printers ability to correctly gauge how much paper
    to pull through off. A 21\" deep  document might come out at 20.25\" etc. That
    problem might not be an issue with sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I sometimes add sizing to my paper, which solves the bleed issue. I know
    that many ink jet printers have an \"art paper\" setting -- I assume this is to
    compensate for excessive bleed? It's ok if the final product is a little rustic
    -- it's the look I'm after.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've been able to line up my pages fairly
    closely (not exactly) on other printers, and this is fine -- it lends to the handmade
    impression.\r\n\r\nMost inkjets seem to emphasize their \"photo\" capabilities,
    which I could care less about. I cannot find any models that currently tout any
    of the qualities I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nI'll check out the 3000. If anyone has
    recommendations for specific brands/models, I'd be grateful."

    Look at the low end of the wide format for other options.\r\n\r\nYou will need
    something like this\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iproofsystems.com/powerrip_x.htm\r\n\r\nto
    get the stylus color 3000 to work most likely, which would take it out of your
    budget. "

  body: Is Powerrip any good these days? I had bought an early version, for my first
    Epson and it gave me awful results. That was 5 or 6 years ago, hopefully it's
    better now.

  body: I had a pretty good workflow going until I upgraded to CS3 and 10.4. PowerRip
    X was part of it, but it was the only way I had found to get Postscript to the
    printer. I was using the PowerRip profiles and all seps were in the the RIP. It
    was pretty good. I like the roll paper for big boxes and page spreads. IDK what
    I'm going to replace it with.

    operating system and you can only get postscript output with a third party RIP.
    There was an Epson StylusRIP software that was not supported as the Mac OS evolved.

    used to have the RIP problem before printing from Quark - but that was back when
