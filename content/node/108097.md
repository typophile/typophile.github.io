  body: "No problem finding fonts with ball terminals and hairline connecting strokes
    OR ball terminals and a curved transition from ball to connecting strokes similar
    to the image. But a quick check did not turn up a ball terminal font font with
    both features. Hope someone finds it.\r\nIn the interim here a ball terminal font
    with a curved transition from ball to thin connecting strokes similar to the image.
