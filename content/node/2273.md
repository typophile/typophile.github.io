body: 'Hello. <BR>So, here follows my first modest attempt at creating a face, and
  my first post here as well. <BR> <BR>This first part of rambling concerns the &#34;display&#34;
  version: <BR>What I initially had in mind was indeed a very dark &#39;grotesk&#39;
  &#40;yes I&#39;m danish which is quite close to germany&#41;. And it was supposed
  to have been a display face including only capitals. As I progressed I felt it perhaps
  could be more and started working on lowercase as well. It is not to be seen as
  complete, rather very much in progress.  <BR>The lowercase alphabet caused me a
  lot of troubble, and right now I can&#39;t seem to get on with it, so please critique
  would be nice.  <BR> <BR>Now the &#34;text&#34; version: <BR>As I was doing the
  lowercase, I decided to progress it into a more human sans, and see wether that
  was possible. The result you see here is very much not finished, but indeed this
  is the face which I am in most need of critique and pointers. <BR>I hope you&#39;ll
  help out, -Thomas <BR>&#40;By the way, the reason the lowercase &#39;g&#39; is red,
  is that I am not quite sure wheter to do a single story or this..&#41; <BR><img

  body: 'Hi Thomas, <BR> <BR>Here are some thoughts for you to consider: <BR>1&#41;
    The text version is better all the way around. I&#39;d pursue that one. <BR>2&#41;
    This is condensed, but some glyphs are wide. Either narrow them up, or widen up
    the others. If you do intend this for text, i&#39;d suggest widening the others.
    The wide letters are: c, g, s. <BR>3&#41; Again if this is in fact for text, you
    will probably want to decrease the x-height. That is, unless it is intended as
    a small-size, space saving type. In that case, you would need to refine the letterforms
    for performance at that size. <BR>4&#41; If you&#39;re going to put the caps with
    the text version, you may want to make the cap letterforms more open. &#40;Compare
    upper and lower case Ss - caps vs text&#41; Same goes for the numerals. <BR> <BR>5&#41;
    Individual letters &#40;text&#41;: <BR>e: Has a slight overbite :-&#41; <BR>g:
    Tight in the waist. Drop the bottom down to rest on &#40;or slightly above&#41;
    the baseline. <BR>i: Should it hook like the l? Just a thought. Or maybe it is
    a square serif to the right on both? <BR>m,n: Is the m just two n&#39;s? if so
    you&#39;ll need to widen the n. If you choose to widen all the letters mentioned
    above, keep the m at it&#39;s current width. <BR>r: Too narrow. Looks like a chopped
    n. You&#39;ll need to lower the join between the branch and stem &#43; widen the
    branch adding a touch more heft at the end. <BR>s: Looks flipped. But I bet if
    you rotate it 180 it will still look flipped. Try shortening the top arm. Lengthening
    the bottom arm, and raising the spine up to where it &#42;looks&#42; in the middle.
    <BR>t: A bit wider on the right. <BR>u: Looks like the n rotated 180. This make
    it look wider by comparison. They should &#42;look&#42; the same. <BR>v,w: Several
    issues here. First, the bottoms are too flat. Look at Helvetica bold condesed
    for tricks to narrow up the base but keep the crotch deep &#40;btw, this is a
    tough problem '

    I suggest you focus on working with the display-version <BR>instead of both at
    the same time? I think it might turn out quite well... <BR> <BR>:-&#41; <BR> <BR>Fedt

  body: Hey, I saw my name mentioned in there :-&#41; <BR>Oday ouyay eakspay Nicolaj
    igpay atinlay? <BR>&#40;He he. Couldn&#39;t help myself!&#41; <BR> <BR>So what
    will it be, my advice to go with the &#42;text&#42; version, or Nicolai&#39;s
    advice to go with the &#42;display&#42; version. We are a confused group aren&#39;t
    we? <BR> <BR>Since this is your first font I wouldn&#39;t worry about trying to
    make it too unique. Get the basics first. If it&#39;s too crazy, you can avoid
    wrestling with issues type designers have worked on since they put down the pen
    and picked up the press. My suggestion might be to make a thoroughly mundane type.
    Looking a lots of sources to guide your decisions. You will learn quickly in this
    fashion. Then use the knowledge as a point of departure. <BR> <BR>Randy

    words! <BR>Og ikke mindst, til danskerne <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>Hmmm... what to choose, the text or display version?
    -Well indeed I am quite sure the text version would be most interesting in all
    aspects, as it would undoubtfully be the best &#39;learning experience&#39; to
    throw myself into the troubbles of making it well balanced and &#40;hopefully&#41;
    legible as well.  <BR>And the possibility of adding more personality and a little
    more quirkyness to the face intrigues me equally. Also it would allow me to work
    on the capitals as well, as they would then need to be more in line with the lowercase.  <BR>So,
    enough rambling, I think I&#39;ll leave the &#39;display&#39; as it is, and focus
    on the &#39;text&#39; version. I will continually be uploading work-progress in
    this thread &#40;hopefully you might want to give me some pointers along the way..&#41;.
    <BR>Again, thanks for the help -this sort of thing &#40;forums that is..&#41;
    might indeed be what makes the internet great! <BR>-Thomas

  body: Hi Dan. <BR>The fact that the circles connect to the letters, is not per se
    the norm. But if you look into danish typography history &#40;mostly based on
    a handful of architects and their work&#41;, you will find this detail in many
    early danish faces. I suspect the original idea of this was to &#39;save space&#39;
    in order to have lesser leading. As most of the pioneers of danish type history
    were architects they were indeed more practical oriented rather than focused on
    typography history as such. Anyway, I included this feature in the face to keep
    some &#39;nationality&#39; in it. I would gladly post some more about dansih type
    history if people are interested, as the subject is something I take great interest
    in myself ;&#41; <BR>-Thomas
