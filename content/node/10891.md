  over when I upgraded. If anyone knows the name or where I can find it I would be
  greatly appreciative. It&#39;s the &#34;Venus&#34; part used in the image. <BR>

  body: Peter, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen this thing for years as a freebie font <BR>called
    &#34;Black Chancery&#34;. Not sure who designed <BR>it or if it&#39;s a knockoff
    of somebody else&#39;s <BR>design, but it&#39;s availble here... <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.masterstech-home.com/The_Library/Font_Samples/Font_Indices/Image_Pages/B/BlackChancery.html"
