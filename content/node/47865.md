body: "I hope I can phrase this clearly, and thanks in advance for any help. This
  is an example of a problem I've had for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if there's
  a simple solution, but I've yet to find it.\r\n\r\nSay I recently bought the regular,
  bold, italic, and bold italic versions of a font -- let's say Scala OT for this
  example. I'm writing a document in Word on my work PC and using Scala Regular as
  my main font. If I want to italicize something, I can't just hit Ctrl-I and type.
  Instead of mapping to Scala Italic, the program just slants Scala Regular to the
  right a bit.\r\n\r\nSo, I have to change the face to Scala Italic, type my phrase,
  and then change the font back to Scala Regular. This is such a pain, especially
  when it comes to longer documents.\r\n\r\nSome programs (e.g., Illustrator and Photoshop)
  are smart enough to map the font properly on their own, but many others (e.g., Word
  and Fireworks) are not.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to get around this problem? I'd
  love it if there was a system-wide fix for my PC (I use XP at work). But at this
  point, I'd settle for a program-specific workaround in Word -- since that's where
  I do most of my long-form writing.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can offer!"

    mine). You should contact the foundry you got them from to see if they have style-linked
    versions of the fonts available. If not, inquire as to whether you can make such
    modifications yourself, under their license terms.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\nT"

  body: 'Thomas I recall that Adobe, for some considerable number of years, encouraged
    the font industry _not_ to style-link its fonts (without, however, doing anything
    to unlink its own fonts) on the grounds that doing so would prevent the many customer
    complaints of faked italic or bold that would occur when the requisite weight
    was missing. Adobe also encouraged software developers not to accept style-linked
    fonts. Some seem to have heeded this advice. Confusion consequently seems to reign. '

  body: "Style-linking is a dangerous thing to be messing with... mostly for compatibility
    reasons. If you make a system-wide change on your PC, it won't help with anything
    you send to anyone else (without providing them with the same modified font).\r\n\r\nAlthough
    it's a pain, your best bet is probably to use \"Ctrl-I\" as you want to, then
    do a find-and-replace after you're done typing. Hopefully the application(s) you
    use will allow you to search (and replace) by style(s), so you can do a complete
    update of the entire document at once (changing \"fake\" italics to \"real\" italics)."

  body: Thanks all for the for the feedback. I will contact the foundries where I've
    purchased some of these fonts, as you suggested, Thomas. And if that doesn't work,
    I'll probably wind up following your advice, Scott. And you're right, billtroop,
    confusion does seem to reign!

  body: "<em>I\u2019d settle for a program-specific workaround in Word</em>\r\n\r\nI
    think the workaround would be to define a character format for italicized passages,
    assign the italic weight of the font to this character format and assign a keystroke
    so you can call it, similar to the keystroke combination of the Italic button."

    out some of the truly false statements in \r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2005/10/phasing_out_typ.html.
    \r\n\r\n(The gravamen of which is that Adobe tried, through Thomas, to get everyone
    to believe that Vista would not support any type except fresh-minted Adobe OTF
    - - so you'll have to re-buy your library in OTF. It's magnificently crafted to
    make you give up on all font formats before OTF - - and it's simply not true.
    Microsoft is supporting every font format it ever did since Windows95 or even
    3.1 -- and Apple is not too very far behind. You can imagine what Microsoft thinks
    of this - - Adobe is blaming Microsoft for you, the customer, having to buy your
    library over in OTF -- unless of course you're on a Mac -- and the only problem
    is, none of it is true.)\r\n\r\nAnd by the way - - can you name a single false
    thing I've ever said? I've given you specifics, now you give me some. "

  body: "Though it looks like this thread (while short) is already getting sidetracked,
    here's my update.\r\n\r\nI contacted FontShop about some of the fonts I've purchased.
    They've said that, for a fee, I can get the fonts style-linked. (The fonts are
    from their FontFont foundry, making the process simple. Otherwise, I guess I'd
    have to contact the creating foundry.)\r\n\r\nI don't don't know the cost, yet,
    but I'll be paying the fee -- my work is paying for it, anyway.\r\n\r\nFor convenience's
    sake, I do wish that they offered style-linked versions of their fonts for immediate
    purchase, though. I understand that there are many weights of something like Scala,
    but I think a four-in-one style-linked pack of the common weights (regular, bold,
    italic, and bold italic) would be a smart move. Even if it cost a bit more, I'd
    opt for those versions all the time."
