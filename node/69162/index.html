  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hi guys,</p>
<p>I will start a Philosophy book in the future. The style is mostly text with very few pictures. A very classic approach in design but well done. Do you know of good editorials that i could take a look at the use of typography and design? I thought on Penguins Books, maybe some Phaidon ones but i cannot think of another one.</p>
<p>Any help or ideas?</p>
<p>Cheers,
S</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Take a close look at the work that Bruce Mau has done for Zone Books. (Any title will do, as he&rsquo;s basically designed them all). If you can find a copy of his book <em>Life Style,</em> he devotes many pages to this topic, and even specifies some 40 or so composition rules that he follows for Zone Books. It is all very sound advice.</p>
<p>Other excellent points of reference are some of the better designed titles from MIT, as well as anything put out by the Princeton Architectural Press.</p>
<p>The work of Richard Eckersley is superlative, but harder to come by. (He did many titles for the University of Nebraska Press, among others.)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t remember Bruce Mau&hellip;now that you said i am connecting the dots, he is the designer of the famous Architecture book  S,M, L, XL, of Rem Koolhaas one of my favorite studios. I will try to get Life Stye if it available somewhere in Spain.</p>
<p>MIT and Princeton Architectural Press are good tips as well, i guess there more easy info on the net.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">With Penguin, just try and pick up one of the older (orange/green/blue) paperbacks for a few pennies on amazon (or at a second-hand bookshop) to look at the layout and typesetting. They&rsquo;re all just based on golden section rules, there&rsquo;s a load of information online if you dig around, and here&rsquo;s [[http://ronin-group.org/misc_etext_tschichold.html|Jan Tischgold&rsquo;s composition rules]]. Monotype Joanna, Monotype Plantin and Linotype Pilgrim show up frequently, all would be good choices. Joanna and Pilgrim are both Eric Gill typefaces, very good, make very readable book text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I should mention that Bruce Mau plainly acknowledges his debt to Jan Tschichold, and there exists a clear lineage between the two men&rsquo;s respective rules of composition. Both are worthy of close study. Bruce Mau elected to set all of the Zone Books in Eric Gill&rsquo;s Perpetua, which Tschichold had been known to use to great effect. (Many of the classic Penguin covers were of course set in Gill Sans).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sebastian, the Tschichold/Penguin approach is a great reference - one of the greatest editorial design achievement of XX century, though it should not be taken as an absolute reference <em>per se</em>. Tschichold was a master in book design, and was central in reviving the quality editorial design in popular literature during last century, but one should always consider that he was a man thinking and working some forty/fifty/sixty years ago, in a completely different technological environment. That is to say, for example, that the typefaces he used and championed (in letterpress years) aren&rsquo;t necessarily the best ones to use today. I, for example, would think twice before setting a book in Perpetua or Joanna: excellent metal types (see Gill&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;On Typography&rdquo;) with a weak digital translations. Same for the Golden Section - setting a double page spread with those proportions can be risky if you don&rsquo;t mind having a very narrow inner/very wide outer and bottom margins (and you should always consider how the book will be binded - softcover of hardcover?). So, if you&rsquo;re after some good editorial book design (in the essay genre), first of all I would have a look to your local bookshops and libraries, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s tons of good stuff among Spanish publishers. Then I would consider using a contemporary typefaces; and if you&rsquo;re after a revival, there are some great <em>recent</em> digital interpretations to consider, both in the Renaissance/Venetian/Garamondish/Humanistic and in the Neoclassical/Romantic types. Finally, here is a quick link to the work of a great book designer (see the illustrated books section in particular):</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest that Bruce Mau&rsquo;s use of Perpetua had anything to do with Jan Tschichold (I have no evidence either way). It&rsquo;s a superb design. Ordinarily I would agree with Nicola&rsquo;s assessment of the face&rsquo;s digital incarnation, but for Zone Books it was an inspired choice. An outwardly correct form, slightly sculptural, but with a subtle hint of perversity. In their pages I have even noted a customized version, where the ascenders/descenders of the italic <em>f</em> have been, how shall I put it, somewhat &ldquo;castrated&rdquo;—</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it to a novice.</p>

<p>ncaleffi, indeed interesting to take Jan Tschichold reference but be aware of today&rsquo;s technological changes. Good point about Golden Section as well, not sure which will be the binding system now. I believe it will be softcover with maximum 80 to 100 pages. Actually is more of a Journal, Essays Books than a regular narrative biger book. I like Avery work, very nice indeed.</p>
<p>Christopher, i did check some Zone Books on the net, not a physical one and they seem to be very quite originally designed.</p>
