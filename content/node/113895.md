    the search easier...\r\nFunny thing is it looks quite the same as the one used
    on [[http://typophile.com/node/113867|FC Barcelona Facebook]]."

  body: "Offhand this does not ring a bell. If I had to make the letters I would start
    with a font such as Scout Cond Black by Cyrus Highsmith http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/scout/\r\nThe
    outline curvature and weight are pretty close. Do a slight drop in the bottom
    of the bowl on R -- which results in separating the leg from the lhs stroke to
    match the image -- and raise the midstroke on B. Prune terminals on S. Prune G.
    \ Shift diagonal on N to make pointed junction with vertical stroke. I, A & V
    pretty much as is. Minor job.\r\nDon\r\n"
