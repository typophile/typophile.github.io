    If just remaking one already out, probably should give it up now before spend
    too much time on it.\r\n"

  body: Quincunx has a good point, plus, if you elaborate on the glyphic character
    of your font that you set in the 'g', for example, you got a much more unique
    font.

  body: "Nice. I love it. Especially the 'g' and the 'b'. The 'c' does also have quality,
    although in an odd manner.\r\nI like it that the 'k' does not connect.\r\nSome
    minor points of attention maybe; somehow I'm not sure about the 'd'. I mean how
    the bowl joins the stem. The 'm' can also use some work, the right shoulder seems
    a bit wobbly. But theres also a pixely-thing going on there. \r\nHow about a PDF
    next time? So people can look at individual shapes better, and to avoid strange
    pixel anomalies.\r\n\r\nKeep it up."

      the originator of this thread are able to edit the first post of the thread
      to attach PDF or other file types besides the usual image formats. Have a look
      at my thread on Agamemnon in this subforum. I've appended the first post many
      times with new PDFs documenting the evolution of that font.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah, nice one. I love zooming in on glyphs. ;)\r\nYour 'm' does indeed look
    better, but could probably still use a bit of tweaking here and there.\r\nIt might
    be the PDF, but your 'a' has a wobble where the lower stroke of the bowl joins
    the stem. And the 's' as well, on the top left curve.\r\n\r\nCan't type longer
    reply right now, as it's too late right now over here."

  body: "Not sure at present, am more occupied with getting the basics down, and then
    an italic version. Normally I just do an oblique, but this is a bit more 'professional'
    than I normally do, so would be silly to not at least attempt this.\r\n\r\nAlso
    having a visual display problem I am trying to clear up. As mentioned in another
    thread, there is a basic demo version I have placed in a newsgroup (alt.binaries.font
    - NOT fonts) which shows this.\r\n\r\n"
