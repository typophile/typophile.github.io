body: "Hello Typophile-\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to get some feedback on my first attempt
  at a complete and functioning typeface.\r\nCosmos slab is meant to be a display
  face, but if I can make it legible at small sizes that would be a wonderful bonus.
  It was drawn in illustrator and brought in to fontlab where I'm endlessly tinkering
  with it. I'm currently working on the widths of the uppercase and numbers, as they
  are a bit out of tune. Any extra suggestions/ comments would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n-elsa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cosmos_specimen_pg2_6491.jpg]"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWell I think it has some nice characteristics, but I think it
    still needs quite a bit of work. I won't go too much into detail, as I understand
    this is still a work in progress. The things I think you need to look into the
    most:\r\n\r\n-Overall I think it still feels rather unbalanced, some characters
    look quite wide whereas others are quite thin (I'm thinking about the lowercase
    u and the capital H for instance). They just don't feel like a coherent set yet.
    It has the look of a monospaced typeface yet it isn't, which is also a bit weird,
    so I would look into the spacing as well. Compare with simular fonts to see the
    difference in approach.\r\n\r\n-Some of the slab serifs feel like they are stuck
    on afterwards, or come in places we're one doesn't expect one (2 and 3). This
    is strange, especially because it's inconsitant. You could use this to make your
    font stick out, but then it needs to be worked out more.\r\n\r\n-This may be a
    bit of a trick question, but I could not help asking: Would does distinquish this
    font from other slab serifs (f.i. Lubalin graph)? I don't see a clear distiquishing
    feature, so I would like to know more about your influences and motivations in
    creating this typeface.\r\n\r\nI hope I wasn't too harsh on you, but I hope it
    helps....\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

  body: "I think there are a few fonts out there called Cosmos or some variant thereof,
    and this design doesn't particularly evoke anything particularly cosmic to me.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I don't have a problem with some of the unusual serif placements. They look
    fine on the 2 and 3, for example.\r\n \r\nThe 3, B and S look a bit top-heavy,
    but they may be symmetrical. It's an illusion that should be compensated for.
    P and R appear to sag a bit, and n looks too narrow. Overall not too bad at all."

  body: "mk2: although I like those serifs, it's true that they are a bit odd- so
    I might consider taking them out alltogether.\r\n\r\nQueneau: thank you for your
    imput- I am working on the consistency of the widths, and your right that the
    spacing needs help. As for my reasoning for making it- I have always had an affinity
    for slab serifs, and wanted to try my hand at making my own, taking out some of
    the things that bother me about other faces, and adding my own touches.\r\n\r\ncuttlefish:
    i'll take a look at the characters you mentioned, thanks for the imput.\r\n\r\n"
