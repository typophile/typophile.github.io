  body: "As Richard suggested, I prefer to mix styles when setting TOCs; that is,
    if the chapter titles are in italic, folios are not, etc. It helps to clearly
    define that the folios are not part of the chapter titles, especially if you're
    going to set the two close together.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, contrary to Richard's
    suggestion about setting the folios flush-right under the \"s\" from \"Contents,\"
    no, no, no. I'll never understand why people insist on stretching this relationship
    and thus straining the reader's eye to connect titles to folios; just because
    that's how it was done for a very long time does not make it a good idea.\r\n\r\nOne
    possible and simple solution is to throw the folios on the other side of the titles.
    Create 2 tab stops, one to set the folios flush-right, and another to set the
    titles flush-left, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Contents_6505.gif]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHowever,
    this option would screw with the right-thrust of the overall design, so it may
    not be appropriate in this case."

  body: "Regarding the type, right-align it and set the page numbers in regular characters.
    \r\n\r\nI'd lose the entire headline unless the brochure is huge and there's something
    going on that makes the contents page easy to miss. Every literate adult in Western
    Civilization can look at that page and know what it is without needing it spelled
    out. But if you do decide to leave it there, Futura and that serif are worlds
    apart and the effect they have on each other is cacophonous. Futura comes in enough
    weights that you can break things up just fine without needing to throw another
    font into the mix."

    for your help, I that hellish project has finally been sent to print.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Jpad, as for the Berling/Futura mix, I don't think it looks right, but I had no
    say in the fonts."

    agree. A designer I learned a lot from (John Menapace) said the only reason to
    line them all up was to make it easier to sum them. Why pander to compulsive behavior?"
