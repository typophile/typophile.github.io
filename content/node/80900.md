body: I'm designing a magazine cover, and I'm having difficulty on typeface choices.
  I'm stuck because I'm not sure if there is a general rule for hierarchy when putting
  content highlights on the cover. It's really hard for me to choose typeface combos
  that are not over used or just don't look right on a magazine cover. Is there a
  universal strategy or group of typefaces anyone can suggest for me? Thanks!

  body: Oh yeah right...The magazine is about cultures around the world. Not extremely
    serious and more for inquiring minds.
