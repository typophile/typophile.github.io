body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project for which I'm using Optima (I own Optima
  LT Std), but I would loooove to have the true italics that Optima Nova offers. However,
  my client doesn't really have the budget to buy new fonts, and I certainly cannot
  afford to buy all, or even a few weights, of Optima Nova. However, I'm thinking
  that I (or he) may be able to afford one or two italic weights. My concern is if
  the italic of Optima Nova will go well with Optima LT, or if the difference will
  be noticeable. It seems that, while there is SOME difference in the roman letterforms\u2014the
  'a', especially, they seem to be pretty consistent. And I understand Hermann Zapf
  himself was a designer of Nova, so I would expect the differences to be slight.
  \r\n\r\nIn short: do you think I could mix the roman of Optima LT Std with the italic
  of Optima Nova?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, sorry for the longwinded explanation.\r\n\r\n"

    fact, the originals are the true italics, and the revisions are somewhat pretentious,
    occasioned perhaps by the marketing requirement to provide an obvious visual difference,
    rather than in any merit this style of italic may have for the typeface in question.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in the OpenType era it seems that stylistic alternates don't break the bounds
    of a typeface design.\r\nSo perhaps both styles of italic could be included in
    such fonts, with one as default and the other as a Stylistic Set."

    It's entirely possible that they are not, which would make for a great deal of
    inconvenience in practice.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you all so much. That definitely helps. Looks like they would, in fact,
    be compatible!\r\n\r\nNick: I understand that, especially with fonts like Optima,
    which were designed with an oblique. Without paying any disrespect to Zapf's original
    Optima, though, it comes down to aesthetics for me\u2014I just personally prefer
    an italic to an oblique. Thanks, though, for the information! And that is an interesting
    idea, using roman, italic AND oblique..."

  body: The only thing I don't really care for in the Optima Nova italic is the tail
    on the lowercase l, which contravenes the general treatment of the type. Other
    than that, I disagree with Nick and think the new italic is in every respect an
    improvement on the awkward oblique. I do think italic types modelled on slanting
    the roman letterforms <em>can</em> work, but digital Optima doesn't because a)
    it is too wide and b) the stroke contrast is distorted. With regard to this, I
    think it would be worthwhile to compare the digital oblique Optima italic with
    the original metal version. I am almost certain that someone cheated somewhere
    along the way -- either in the phototype manufacturing or the later conversion
    to Type 1 -- and mechanically obliqued the roman type.

    them in pre-PostScript digital formats, and you can find specimens.\r\n\r\nThey
    disappeared in the same period as the real Futura italics and drawn ITC Avant
    Garde obliques in the early Type 1 days.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Peter. So the light, distorted Optima oblique is an artefact of the
    PS digital conversion. This doesn't surprise me. The Type 1 format includes a
    slant value that can be used to produce an oblique font from a set of upright
    outlines. This was done for a number of Adobe/Linotype fonts. Helvetica was another
    example.\r\n\r\nIt's always fun to watch the look on someone's face when they
    open e.g. the Type 1 version of Helvetica Italic in FontLab and realise that they're
    looking at a set of roman outlines."

  body: "All of the digital Optima\u2019s compare badly to the original letterset
    \u2014 too much of a compromise in the verticals (those subtle concaves!). One
    would have thought that high resolution output and better hinting would facilitate
    a more accurate representation\u2026 But looking at my early Optima letterproof,
    I have to conclude that the original is still eons ahead.\r\n\r\n . . .\r\nBert
