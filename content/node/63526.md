  how useful this site can be. \r\n\r\nI have a pretty specific question.\r\nI'm looking
  to download the font \"Nasty\" by misprintedtype free for a MAC. I have a link for
  it (http://www.misprintedtype.com/v3/fonts/popup.php?tipo=free&font=13) but for
  some reason the download is coming up as an error. Does anyone know how I can fix
  this, and/or another place I can find this font as a free MAC download?\r\n\r\nThanks
  ahead of time for any help or suggestions!\r\n~ff"

  body: Strange... I can download it using Safari, but I get an error that says "An
    error has occurred while expanding the file "Nasty.sit" (Resource not found.)Any
    idea why that would be happening?

  body: When I downloaded it, it automatically unpacked the ZIP file and did give
    me an error for the SIT file. All I had to do at that point was double-click on
    the SIT and the font was there.

    click on the downloaded sit file. I also tried opening Stuffit Expander first
    and dragging the sit file onto it. I get the same error message.\r\n\r\n"
