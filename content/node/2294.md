  body: Okay, let me phrase it differently, and with a lot more words. &#34;VH1&#34;
    originally stood for &#34;Video Hits 1,&#34; but nobody remembers that. The old
    logo emphasized the &#34;1,&#34; which ties into the slogan &#34;Music First&#34;
    -- probably an attempt to differentiate VH1 from sister station MTV, who were
    showing fewer videos and more non-music programming. The new logo emphasizes the
    Vh, with the backwards 1 disappearing into the h. Maybe there&#39;s something
    obvious I&#39;m missing &#40;wouldn&#39;t be the first time&#41;, but what does
    this new logo represent?

  body: This topic has come up on other boards. Forgive me if I repeat what I&#39;ve
    said elsewhere.&#41; <BR> <BR>Why hang on to the old logo? Sure, nothing was wrong
    with it, but nothing was great about it either. It was stagnant, symmetrical and
    vanilla. That&#39;s why I appreciate their need to move on. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not
    sure what to think of the new logo. The leaf, the hacked h and flipped 1 feel
    fresh. But overall it seems kind of slapped together. The stroke weights of the
    V h and 1 don&#39;t fit and Helvetica just seems tired here... <BR> <BR>But the
    net takeaway is a needed change in that it lets the  VH1 mark grow up. <BR> <BR>The
    broadcast work is rock solid. The whole play on pop culture is fun and the original
    scoring is great. Finally, to beat the MTV comparison to death -- you can tell
    they&#39;re not deifying the logo like MTV did. See the VH1 reel at <a href="http://www.weworkforthem.com"
    target="_blank">WeWorkForThem</a>. <BR> <BR>&#40;WWFT did not design the logo.
    It was done in-house at VH1 by Nancy Mazzei.&#41;

    and if it&#39;s a leaf hten it needs to be clearer. But we shouldn&#39;t have
    to guess. And I wont even discuss the relative weights of the 1 and the &#34;h&#34;.

  body: 'What difference does it make if it&#39;s a V folding on itself or a leaf
    or just an abstract organic shape? Should a logo always be a literal representation?
    I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m not necessarily going to defend this logo to the
    death, but I don&#39;t think it should be dismissed because we don&#39;t immediately
    get it. <BR> <BR>And Kevin, you don&#39;t really think they have MTV envy do you?
    I can&#39;t imagine them sitting in a conference room saying, &#34;what can we
    do to evoke the MTV logo?&#34; At least I want to give them more credit than that.
    <BR> <BR>That said, I think the execution is lacking. &#40;As I&#39;ve said before
    in this thread.&#41; <BR> <BR>Mike, your original logo may have worked well at
    the time, just like the second logo worked for them through the last decade. I
    see this third logo as simply more of the same. Not stylistically the same but
    it&#39;s an adequate logo that will serve them well for a time but need to be
    replaced or evolved sooner than later. <BR> <BR>Couldn&#39;t we argue that identities
    for these kind of ephemeral brands &#40;fashion, music, extreme sports, etc.&#41;
    need to change more often to stay relevant or interesting? &#40;Food thought,
    not necessarily words to design by.&#41; <BR> <BR>I think this is why this particular
    logo redesign is interesting. Because it&#39;s not for an airline or a telecom
    or something that needs to convey stability, longevity, timelessness, etc. It
    almost demands to be redone regularly. <BR> <BR>Re: Speak Up <BR>True, Grant.
    That&#39;s where you can see my earlier comments in context. As much as I like
    some of the dialogue at Speak Up, the acidic tones &#40;attitude&#41; over there
    are hard to take in large doses.'

  body: VH1 and MTV cannot be compared ... really ... I mean, think about it. It is
    almost ... not quite ... like comparing haute couture to street fashion. Most
    of the haute couture fashion houses that are still in business have reinvented
    themselves through their clothes, but not their &#34;logos&#34;. But, most street
    cred fashion changes so often. Think about the hangtags that so many different
    designers did for <a href="http://www.idanda.net/brand.php?article=111" target="_blank">Express</a>,

    <BR> <BR><b>I</b> wanted to give them more credit than <b>that.</b> I saw how
    the shapes in &#34;h1&#34; were smooshed together to make a sort of T, and how
    the V extended off the side of the block, and said to myself, &#34;At least someone
    was trying to do something even if they may have failed. I can respect that.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Instead it&#39;s the free verse philosophy. &#34;There&#39;s no right

  body: I have no problem with non-representational logos, and perhaps if the VH1
    logo were just the type treatment I wou&#39;dve bought that argument. My issue
    is it looks like it&#39;s trying to symbolize something, but is really meaningless.
    Why a box? Why a leaf? Why is the type crammed onto one side with a big empty
    panel to the right? The designer&#39;s explanation can be summed up as &#34;why
    not?&#34;  <BR> <BR>Sure, music and pop-culture industry logotypes have to change
    with the times, but to build something clunky and not worry about it because it&#39;s
    just going to get changed again anyway seems pretty lazy to me, and would tend
    to reinforce the notion that VH1 stands for nothing and will more than likely
    change directions when the next trend rolls along. Maybe that&#39;s the truth,
    but it&#39;s hardly the thing you want to emphasize in your corporate identity.

    are supposed to be revolutionary thinkers. Most of you sound like you are 95 years
    old and haven&#39;t been laid in 75 of those 95 years. Not one of you has thought
    in terms of how this logo will be used or that it&#39;s playful nature reflects
    the VH1 brand direction. Granted, the gray version at the top of this page isn&#39;t
    the best execution, but seeing it in motion is all the payoff you need. <BR> <BR>Nice

    and still come to a negative conclusion. I examined it, looked for possible motives
    for the choices made, and read the justifications expounding that the design is
    existentially appropriate to something or other, but what I see is still the picture
    I would put next to &#34;arbitrary&#34; in a dictionary. Some seem to be arguing
    that that <b>is</b> the message VH1 should want associated with itself &#40;most
    notably the assertion that begging to be replaced with another design as soon
    as possible is one of its inherent strengths&#41;, in which case, great job. But

    and, worse, doesn&#39;t tell me anything at all about the channel. The same holds
    true for the original MTV-logo, sure, but that at least has the power of nostalgia
    and a certain &#40;s&#41;punky flair that I dig. The redesign for VH1 cold just
    as well be for some health-care organisation or some wellness product. Frankly,
    I&#39;d rather have seen VH-1 all done in Helvetica and be done with it :-D.  <BR>Nancy,
    great to see you defend your work and if it really was picked from 25 designs,
    all the more power to you and your work. But, alas... a pitch with TWENTYFIVE
    new logos, in my opinion, is a grave mistake in itself. I&#39;m completely against
    pitches these days, and maybe that is the problem with the logo.

  body: "This got me wondering how most other well known logos have been chosen. How
    do they get the nod of approval from the typical target audience of design unsavy
    higher-ups (usually CEOs, partners and probably their family members)? How did
    logos like Lucent, NASA (worm), bp, etc. make the committee say \"aha!\"? \r\n\r\nI
    think was just circumstance that Nancy was employed at the time that VH1 was taking
    submissions for a new logo, the same time other firms were submitting. And the
    comets aligned and that select group of decision makers selected Nancy's because
    it hit a vein with most of them; not necessarily everyone in the world, but the
    only decisions that mattered were that of the committees. Which is also the reason
    why we have logo's like Verizon, UPS, Gateway... no one knows the reasons except
    for the people that decided. \r\n\r\nPersonally I like the logo for reasons only
    my gut knows. I like it for the abstract symbol that it is, I like the vibrant
    colors, I like that it doesn't scream out \"We're a music channel!\" Overall,
    I like the new brand of VH1 in general. If I were on that committee, I can imagine
    the amount generic, corporate, overly-thought out, expertly crafted, letterspaced
    submissions and seeing Nancy's and feel a bit of freshness because of it's purely
    \"I put these elements together because it instinctively felt right\". "

    have taste or not is hardly important in some ways. \r\n\r\nThe more pressing
    question for me is - is the VH1 logo 'working' with it's target demographic. Is
    suspect it is. "

    music is directly proportional to how annoying people find it. Ergo: graphic designers
    need to design less for each other. That said, I think the VH1 logo is horridly
    ugly. If I were a viewer, it would cause me to view less of it. But I know I'm

    wouldn't go that far, but I think that might be one measure to consider using
    if you are evealuating the 'success' mark. Being outside a given logo's demographic
    or target group is a hazard/benefit we all share in. ;-)\r\n\r\n> I know I\u2019m
    not normal. \r\n\r\nNot average - certainly.\r\n\r\nI agree that good graphic
    design often challenges the user/viewer a little, and if it is accepted it is
    stronger for the encounter and displaces previously accepted culture.\r\n\r\nAlso
    - people like a little pain. Coke & Fizzy water hurts the tougue & mouth a little.
    Hot foods do too. But we like the stimulation. Design need be no different as
    far as I can see. It's a matter of proportion.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like it a lot, especially the typography, the way the leaf and the flipped
    1 are melded into the V and h, and all stuck together with kind of keyline mortar
    (like the Avant Garde logo). It's clever the way it pokes fun at all those logos
    that are just some type in a square (oops sorry BJ). Yes, it's very clever, very
    fun.

    I like about it is the fact that it's design seems to have incorporate almost
    to know that it is just one in a succession of logos and unlike the others it
    is okay with it's temporary status. That comfort with transience seems cool. It's
    one of the things in aughtie (2000+) design which I found distintctive. VH1 isn't
    my favorite example but is is probably the most ubiquitous example."
