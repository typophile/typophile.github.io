  body: "I think that it's 'Mottek', but it's not rounded like the attached logo.
    \r\nAm I right, or there another variant?\r\nThx in advance."

  body: "The font that Mottek and Cupertino (dafont.com) were based on is detailed
    here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography_of_Apple_Inc.\r\n\r\nThe Apple logo
    characters are the same general width as the characters in your sample logo, so
    I would say that someone has either used the Apple logo characters as a guide
    and drawn the logo by hand or they used one of the two free fonts (both of which
    are a lot wider) and created the logo that way, making the corners and some parts
    round in the process.\r\n\r\nOf the two free fonts, Mottek is the better quality
    one."
