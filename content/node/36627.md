  Programme.\r\nWe used ITC Avant Garde Gothic in the material we put forward.\r\nonly
  to then notice a city wide advertising campaign for a nightclub!\r\nusing on type
  and its set in...ITC Avant Garde Gothic \r\nCan anyone out there recommend something
  similar but modern.\r\nWe chose ITC Avant Garde Gothic because the new Art building
  is very square so the roundness of the typeface worked well against the building.\r\n\r\nplease
  help\r\n\r\nYours peed-off\r\n\r\nMr Brown"
