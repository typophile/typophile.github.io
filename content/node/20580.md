body: "I'm trying to come up with a layout for academic papers on A4 format (210\xD7297
  mm). The papers will be made available online as PDFs to be downloaded and printed.\r\n
  \r\nQuestion: should I treat the single A4 page as the right half of a spread, i.e.
  small left, larger top, even larger right and bottom margins?\r\n\r\nProblem: the
  font is 11 pt Adobe Garamond. From Bringhurst's 'Average character count per line'
  table (<em>Elements</em>, p. 29) I get an optimum line length of 24 pica (103 mm),
  which is not even half the width of the (indeed, much too wide) A4 format. Result:
  very spacious margins, which may be suitable for some luxury edition, but not for
  this kind of writing (home printed on cheap paper). How to fill the width of the
  paper? I see the following possibilities:\r\n\r\nPut the footnotes in a separate,
  narrow bottom aligned column on the right side of the text block. However, the reader
  might not be used to seeing notes there.\r\n\r\nOr trade in the default portrait
  for landscape format and divide the A4 page horizontally in two columns. But the
  end user might have problems printing this; he might not like the format when storing
  the print-out in binders and the like.\r\n\r\nI guess there are other typophiles
  who have fought battles against the A4 standard. What solutions have you come up
  with? "

  body: "If it's not a codex why would you treat it as such? If you're setting up
    single pages, your margins should (conventionally) be symmetrical (eg. L&R=1.5
    : T=2 : B=3).\r\n\r\nAs for the text measure, the obvious answer is up the type
    size to 12, but if you're anything like me 12pt type makes you feel ill. Aside
    from that, remember that Bringhurst's suggestion is the \"optimum\" line length,
    and your format doesn't particularly suit that \"optimum,\" therefore you'll likely
    end up extending it another few picas.\r\n\r\nThe other option, as you mention,
    is to shift the content as though you were, indeed, working with a recto page
    and use the right margin for side-notes. This seems like a lot of work, however,
    for a downloadable, but if you have the time and inclination, you certainly have
    the page size to accomplish the task."

  body: "If you were working with a document that you felt would be mainly read on
    screen the landscape idea is a better solution, but as you say it would be printed
    and bound (presumably at the printer's choice of binding), you would need a generous
    top margin (the binding edge). \r\nFor a portrait format you should probably budget
    for at least a 30mm inside margin to accommodate any form of binding, combined
    with your text measure, would give you a good 50mm column for footnotes, instead
    of having them aligned on the bottom, you could also align them with the reference
    in the text (although that becomes tricky when you have many footnotes to fit
    in).\r\nTim"

    than A4)\r\n\r\nAlthough in order to have a great 2 column layout, you may have
    to reduce the measure to maybe 18 picas and type size to 10pt. The reduced type
    size may pose a problem though if majority of your target audience use inkjet
    printers.\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\nJoseph"

    If you are using proper page layout software a good solution is to have a large
    left  margin into which you put sub-titles, large. Eg you can have them in regular
    italic Adobe Garamond 24 pt. \r\n\r\n3. Another solution is to keep the portrait
    orientation but make a magazine style 3 column lay out. This will probably save
    you pages also, if that is any factor."

    Berkson: <cite>If you are using proper page layout software \u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm
    using Indesign CS2. It is indeed a lot of work, but it might be a good opportunity
    to learn more about InDesign scripting. Can something like moving all footnotes
    in a document (originally imported from a Microsoft Word file) to a separate textframe
    (on the side of the page) be done with scripting?\r\n\r\ntimd: <cite>If you were
    working with a document that you felt would be mainly read on screen the landscape
    idea is a better solution \u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm afraid of the landscape orientation
    because portrait seems to be the default on most printers. Having people print
    landscape PDFs seems to be asking for trouble, i.e. text falling of the page etc.
    In Acrobat Reader in Windows, 'auto rotate and center' is not always on, if I
    recall correctly. I'm not sure what the situation is with Acrobat and Preview
    on the Mac.\r\n\r\ntimd: <cite>footnotes, instead of having them aligned on the

    becomes tricky when you have many footnotes to fit in).</cite>\r\n\r\nI've tried
    'anchoring' the sidenotes to the note reference symbols in the text, but that
    didn't work for all notes. Would it be acceptable if sometimes the note is not
    right next to the reference but slightly lower on the page to make up for a longer
    footnote (or larger number of footnotes) above?\r\n\r\njuki: <cite>The reduced
    type size may pose a problem though if majority of your target audience use inkjet
    printers.</cite>\r\n\r\nGood point, which I hadn't yet considered, really. Maybe
    my font choice is not optimal to begin with? Garamond Premier Pro (silly name,
    by the way) with its rather high contrast isn't particularly suitable for bad
    printing conditions, is it? The reason I chose Garamond because of its Greek:
    I do need a good and complete polytonic/ancient Greek character set. Of course,
    Minion Pro  has that too. Would that work better?\r\n\r\njuki: <cite>You could

    Berkson: <cite>Another solution is to keep the portrait orientation but make a

    <em>three</em> column layouts there. The papers I'm designing are on subject matter
    in the humanities, where you do find multiple (mostly two) column layouts, but
    not that often. I think setting the  papers in multiple columns would convey too
    strong a 'dictionary' or 'encylopaedic' feeling. Even if the columns remind the
    reader of scientific journals, that's not really what I want to achieve. The papers,
    most of which <em>have</em> been published in journals, should be presented here
    in a more personal and individual way. "

    when the footnote is completely bumped to the next page, which will be confusing,
    that really is only a decision you can make based on your knowledge of the frequency
    and length of footnotes. As for the portrait/landscape problem, if your readers
    are likely to make that kind of mistake then you should go for the default setting,
    there might be some document property you can assign that will allow you to specify
    the printing set-up.\r\nTim"

  body: "timd: <cite>Yes \u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nBut even if the sidenotes are moved
    slightly down while still sitting on the same page as their references, the reader's
    eye has to scan a larger area (namely the side column) to find the note he's looking
    for. If the notes were on the bottom of the page, where they would have more a
    more expansive line length, they would need less lines, i.e. the note numbers
    are closer together. \r\n\r\nTschichold says (<em>Ausgew\xE4hlte Aufs\xE4tze \xFCber
    Fragen der Gestalt des Buches und der Typographie</em>, p. 148): \"Fu\xDFnoten
    sind die sp\xE4teste und h\xF6chstentwickelte Form der Noten. Marginalnoten (\u2026)
    sind eine l\xE4ngst veraltete Form.\" (My translation: \"Footnotes are the oldest
    and most developed form of notes. Marginal notes are a form that has since long
    become obsolete.\")\r\n\r\nFor some contrast, see Bringhurst <em>Elements</em>,
    p. 68: \"Sidenotes give more life and variety to the page and are the easiest
    of all to find and read.\"\r\n\r\nApart from those few statements I've not found
    a systematic account of sidenotes and these being put to (good and bad) use. Does
    anyone know of such a work?"

  body: "The trouble with footnotes in this case are that you are trying to make better
    use of a page, so rather than take up space at the bottom of the page that could
    be used for text and leaving large unused areas, sidenotes will use otherwise
    unused space; when the reader has located a sidenote once they will surely not
    have any trouble finding the next one, they will not be difficult to spot after
    all. Footnotes present the problem that the optimum measure is often a lot shorter,
    given the point size is smaller, and you have to consider whether you should stick
    to the text measure or use the optimum measure, equally sidenotes containing long
    urls will also present problems in linebreaks or even having to break the addresses
    over more than one line. The best way to make this decision is to look at your
    provided copy and see if the footnotes might present either problem, if they are
    really heavy you might consider doing them as endnotes (either end of chapter
    or end of document) but they are less user-friendly. As a personal preference
    and with all other things considered I prefer a sidenote to a footnote.\r\nTim"

  body: One other way to deal with a wide page/narrow measure is to have a significant
    left indent. In other words, the headings might start as much as six picas to
    the left of where the text starts. This should work well as long as you have one
    or two headings per page, and for academic work that shouldn't be a problem.
