    \u2014 actually the thinnest weights was based on it. A digital version exists,
    but it\u2019s not for sale anymore (although you can contact [[http://www.incipit.com/typefaces.html|Incipit]],
    as they appear to sell it). Unfortunately, neither version has all the alternates
    used in your sample. "
