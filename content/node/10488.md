  body: It&#39;s a Tuscan of some sort. Good examples include <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/old-vic/">Old
    Vic</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/thunderbird-sb/">Thunderbird</a>.
    Hopefully one of those will do the trick for you.

  body: Actually, looking at the Solotype book, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s &#34;Barndance
    Wide&#34;, but I don&#39;t know of any digitization of that.

  body: The closest I can find to that style &#40;with the right serifs, at least&#41;
    is Font Mesa&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/saloon-girl/"
    target="_blank">Saloon Girl</a>. If it was widened, you might get a similar look.

  body: Dieter Steffmann&#39;s <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/h/hoedown.htm"
    target="_blank"> Hoedown</a> is a digitization of Barndance Regular, not Wide
    &#40;nice ID, Raph&#41;. Stretching it creates a very near match to the sample
    MU, though.

    might be the one.
