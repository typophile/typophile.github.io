  and I was wondering if anyone knew how to access the ornaments? I can't seem to
  find them with any key combination; although they appear when I preview the whole
  repertoire in Fontbook.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    only be accessed by software that uses OpenType (ligatures, either common or discretionary;
    old style figures), and then sometimes only with a manual override -- the ornaments
    hidden under bullets in some fonts, for example.\r\n\r\nAdobe InDesign and Illustrator
    have no problems with these features."

    options, I can't get to the ornaments. When I open the font in FontExplorer, the
    ornaments have no Character code, Unicode or Keystroke assigned to them.\r\n\r\nI'll
    keep trying with the OT features\u2026"

    you want and double click - they are at the bottom of the palette
