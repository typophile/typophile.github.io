  body: As the wizards here haven&#39;t made a stab at it, I&#39;m guessing that it
    was done by the designers at Hyperkit. You could e-mail them.

    know the designer?

  body: The Linotype Catalog does not credit anyone. I think this is an old design
    that they digitized, but old German fonts is not something I have much information
    about.

    few days. I know this one, and it&#39;s been up since Sunday... <BR> <BR>Sorry
    to have let you down people, but the new version has such  <BR>incredibly awesome
    features I just keep going back to beta-test  <BR>some more. This will turn into
    the mother of all type-related websites. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to clean the place
    tomorrow - I have a band rehearsal tonight  <BR>and still need to write this week&#39;s
