  body: "Quoting Mark Simonson from a [[http://typophile.com/node/14501|previous discussion]]
    on Neil Young \"Harvest\" album cover.\r\n<blockquote>I discovered the inspiration
    for this piece of lettering years ago in one of those \"old engraving\" swipe
    books:\r\n[[http://www.marksimonson.com/menu-cut.gif|http://www.marksimonson.com/menu-cut.gif]]\r\nIt's
    a standard cut (sort of like clip art) produced by the MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan
    Foundry of Philadelphia in the 1800s.\r\nI've also got a copy of the original
    Harvest LP. The designer is listed (Tom Wilkes) but no specific credit for the
    lettering. Could be the designer did it. It's skillfully done, whoever did it.
    It's very faithful to the design of the MacKellar cut.</blockquote>\r\nSo definitely
    not-a-font. For some inspiration, may be having a look to [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|LetterHead
    Fonts]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Solotype|Solotype]] would worth a
    shot. "

  body: "Complex lettering like Menu were sold as cuts, bill heads etc by the old
    foundries. There are revival fancy digital fonts that include versions of Menu
    as catchwords together with For, Received From, Account etc. When they are as
    complex as this Menu cut they are sometimes rendered as eps files as in Shutterstock
    or other  packages designed for use with Illustrator. Menu looks very clean and
    regular. I can't decide whether it's high quality lettering, eps or a font catchword.\r\nFurther
    digging might find a digital version.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: It's relatively easy enough to reproduce in Illustrator. This particular one
    in fact is one I did several years ago for a web site; my source was MS&J. It
    is not a typeface but a cut.
