  body: "The boxed set comes with the hand-finished black linen case, which is not
    included if you buy separately. The case is custom designed to fit the various
    sizes of the three volumes. If you don't want the case, you can buy separately
    and it is less expensive.\r\n\r\nMr. Young is also at work on another book which
    will be announced later this year. "

  body: ":-)\r\n\r\nOK, here's my offer: you let me sell the Williams Caslon bundle
    myself, and I'll just give you your price+10%...\r\n\r\nSeriously: these days
    grocery stores will have two sizes of a product, where the per-weight/volume/count
    of the smaller one is nominally higher, but then they discount the smaller one
    and not the larger, making the smaller a better buy. And then they \"helpfully\"
    put the per-weight/volume/count cost on each one, but in different units! Like
    for cooking oil the smaller one will be in cents-per-ounce and the larger will
    be in dollars-per-gallon; for toilet paper one will be in dollars-per-sheet and
    the other in cents-per-square-foot! So you need to work a calculator (assuming
    you even know how many ounces are in a gallon or you're willing to use a ruler
    on buttwipes, in public) to make sure you get the best deal. So you give up and
    grab the big one because larger quantities are <em>supposed</em> to be cheaper.
    So they make more money - and you don't even realize it. Kinda like voting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Letterforms:\r\nIt each page, it shows you the final logo, the font it was based
    on, and how it was customized.\r\n\r\nFonts and Logos:\r\nIt's a deeply study
    of fonts styles subtleties. Great for type designers.\r\nYou will learn to look
    at fonts in a different way.\r\nThe chapter about script it's outstanding!!!\r\n\r\nDangerous
    Curves:\r\nIt's more about the process of creating custom lettering. For each
    logo, it shows you the first sketches, how it evolved, the proposals presented
    to the client, how the logo was refined, and the final art.\r\n\r\nAll 3 are excellent.
    And worth every penny.\r\n"
