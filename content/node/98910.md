body: Unknown source. Looks like Coronet but with Deftone Stylus style connections,
  note capital S and H. No luck with Bowfin Script ID or any of my old metal & filmtype
  catalogs. Any suggestions as to further letters that match. Looks regular enough
  to be a font, but could be just lettering.
