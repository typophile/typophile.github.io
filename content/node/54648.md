  and non-design of philosophical papers\".\r\n\r\nKoj\xE8ve\u2019s <em>Introduction
  to the Reading of Hegel</em> is a book that compiles his lecture notes from a course
  he taught on Hegel\u2019s <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> from 1933\u20131939.
  It is most famous for being the source of the \u201CEnd of History\u201D thesis
  that Francis Fukuyama later made popular in America. The \u201CSage\u201D or \u201CWise
  Man\u201D is, I believe, the equivalent of the Greek sophron, the one who not only
  possesses self-knowledge but whose actions are guided by that knowledge. So it is
  more of an ancient notion than of the academic philosopher who thinks he has \u201Ca
  good job\u201D. Koj\xE8ve argues that Hegel was a Sage or Wise Man who incarnated
  his wisdom in book form, specifically in the <em>Logic</em> and <em>Encyclopedia</em>.
  Hegel\u2019s <em>Phenomenology</em>, he argues, provides the anthropology of this
  appearance of wisdom. The particular three-part wisdom that Koj\xE8ve articulates
  derives also from Hegel\u2019s interpretation of the history of philosophy, especially
  from the Hellenistic philosophers. Koj\xE8ve argues that the \u201CPlatonic\u2013Hegelian
  ideal of Wisdom\u201D is a necessary ideal only for the philosopher, the one who
  \u201Cputs the supreme value in Self-Consciousness\u201D (IRH 84\u201385). Although
  Hegel seems to think that to be human one must be a philosopher, Koj\xE8ve disagrees:
  there are forms of human satisfaction other than wisdom.\r\n\r\nWhat I am doing
  is not actually defending this part of the claim, but taking it as my starting point
  to argue that if one accepts this relation of philosopher to wisdom, one must conceive
  of philosophical activity as necessarily being both a speculative and a productive
  activity, one which produces physical objects that objectively realize human thought.
  And since knowledge of this activity itself is necessary to wisdom, the philosopher
  must be conscious about how he objectively realizes his thought. That is, the philosopher
  cannot become a sage without also becoming a thoughtful designer and craftsperson
  of the objects that realize his thought. (Incidentally, this would undermine Koj\xE8ve\u2019s
  claim that Hegel\u2019s books fully realize wisdom, since Hegel himself did not
  seem to be aware of his philosophical activity in this way). It seems to me that
  this argument articulates its own value: it reveals a necessary aspect of the activity
  of philosophizing, which should be an end in itself for anyone who values self-consciousness.\r\n\r\nDoes
  this still seem unfocussed? I seem to have a trouble with specificity, as I\u2019ve
  rarely written anything my professors said couldn\u2019t be improved by greater
  specificity. To me this seems perfectly focused for a 50-60 page paper at the undergraduate
  level, but maybe not.\r\n"

    I'd like to share some thoughts with you, but I'm not so sure and confident about
    them that I would post them here publicly. :P\r\nIt's also quite lengthy\u2026
    I started writing it on that other thread, but when I start writing, it's hard
    to stop. And I also think that philosophy should probably be a one on one kind
    of thing. A bit like sex: sure, you can have an orgy, but nothing beats being
    focussed on only one thing/person at a time\u2026 after all, we ARE limited beings.
    Aren't we? I'm usually pretty sure we are\u2026 :P but let's not dismiss doubts!
    :D"
