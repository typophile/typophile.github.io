body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'd like to ask for some legal advice. Recently I've discovered
  that some of my work has been copied without permission.\r\nI'm based in London
  but the infringement happened in America, a lawyer that I've initially contacted
  here mentioned that there are different laws, so I'm looking for somebody in the
  States that has a specific knowledge on the field.\r\nAny suggestion or help is
  very much appreciated,\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    section of the forum (perhaps, General Discussions).\r\nSecondly, you are rather
    vague about what happened, so it's a bit difficult giving you advice."
