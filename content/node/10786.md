body: Please excuse me for interrrupting the <BR>fascinating helvetica debate, but
  I have a  <BR>question. I am a student in New Zealand, <BR>and we have been charged
  with a brief -  <BR>to brand NZ. I am, naturally, taking a typogra- <BR>phic approach.
  I woner if any of you typophiles <BR>have been to NZ, or know any thing about it?
  <BR>If so, what strikes you as being quintessent- <BR>ially kiwi typefaces? Thank
  you, keep up the  <BR>debate. &#40;We students learn quite a lot from <BR>these
  ramblings&#41;
