  really. \r\n\r\nI even like the murky watercolor sky.\r\n\r\nAnd Bookman Swash is
  always fun.\r\n\r\nBut what was the designer thinking with Monotype Corsiva?!\r\n\r\nThis
  is one of those \u201C<em>Made in New York City ?!?!?!?!?!</em>\u201D moments.\r\n\r\nMikey

    the designer had in his toolbox? I don't know. I don't know much, if anything,
    about this piece or the circumstances of its creation.\r\n\r\nSounds like you
    don't either.\r\n\r\nMake a better one.\r\n\r\nNo I'm not taking it too seriously.
    Just sayin', you can do better, so go for it. Make something better. Make you
    feel good. Make the world a better place. Fill it with your love. Do what makes
    sense to you. Do what you are good at doing . Do what you enjoy doing.\r\n\r\nAll
    comments made in good faith.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "The illustration and ITC Bookman Swash come from a poster from this film's
    1976 theatrical release. Monotype Corsiva wasn't designed until the 90s, so the
    Corsiva text clearly is a later (careless) addition for the DVD packaging. \r\nThe
    original poster fairly screams 1970s, and its designer was obviously a big fan
    of Milton Glaser. (It could have been Glaser himself, though I can't find any
    evidence that it was. The Bookman looks too gimmicky to be Glaser's; he occasionally
    used swash characters, as on his 1962 jacket for the first Peter Paul & Mary album,
    but his use of type is never this busy.)"

    done by a layman. this totaly wrecks the composition, and it looks bad. the name
    credits above seem also a later addition.\r\n\r\nthis monotype cursiva is horrible.
    i bet it's a standart in pc computers!\r\neugh!"

    to be exact [EDIT: Oops, I see you already said that, PM. Sorry!]. I actually
    remember seeing newspaper ads for this film back then.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.impawards.com/1976/sailor_who_fell_from_grace_with_the_sea.html\">Here's
