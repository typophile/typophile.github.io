  http://www.impawards.com/2008/oxford_murders.html\r\n\r\nOr a better option. I specifically
  like the serifs, the perfectly round O, and that's about it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Indeed. Augustea is a match. Once it's filled anyway. And Penumbra is an excellent
    substitute. Thanks for all your expertise.
