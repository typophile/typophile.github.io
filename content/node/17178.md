  and Microaesthetics\r\n2. Typography: Formation + Transformation\r\n\r\nWhat is
  the difference between them? Are they two volumes of a single manual? Is the latter
  a new edition of the former? What do you think about them?\r\n\r\nTX\r\n\r\nP.S.
  What is the internet address of Willi Kunz Studio?"

  body: "Personally, I think Typography: Formation + Transformation is WAY overpriced.
    $100 bucks for a hardback book is steep. It should be at least HALF that price.
    There are other books that can teach you about type and grid structures. You can
    get TWO books for the same price and can learn the same thing. \r\n\r\nUnivers
    is a GREAT typeface...but given that this is the 21st century, there are many
    other type choices."
