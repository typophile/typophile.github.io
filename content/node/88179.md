    working to find the bug that is currently limiting this), or include the image
    via an html &lt;img&gt; tag for now.\r\n\r\nSorry for the inconvenience."

  body: The exact maximum size is 128K, one K (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte"><strong>KiB</strong></a>
    as some prefer) is 1024 bytes, so that 128K is 131072 bytes.

    my own hosting for previous posts.

  body: If  http://www.fontclod.com/screenshots/alpha0.png is the image you are talking
    about, the answer should be no since its size is quite small, only 41616 bytes.

  body: "Hmm! Then I have no idea. That is the one I am talking about. I just tried
    to upload it again, and it stopped at loading: 40/40 and gave this error: \"onHTTPError:
    407\"\r\n\r\nI'm using Chrome 17 dev on Debian SID 64bit, however I tried it in
    Firefox (called Iseweasel on Debian), and it had the same error. I'm using cell
    internet, could it simply be a bad connection? Although, I've tried multiple times
    and it does appear to be uploading fine, but not accepted."
