  is way too unethical.\r\n\r\nType Directors Club\r\nhttp://tdc.org/\r\n\r\nDesert
  Troon Companies\r\nhttp://www.desert-troon.com/\r\n\r\nThey claim a USPTO registration,

  not sure if the were the 'designers' of the mark or not.\r\n\r\n"

    would never do that?

    I thought it was Jim Parkinson, but I know thats not right. Anyone know who designed
    the logo?\r\n"

    I am not sure who did the logo.

    in different ways with different type. The Bruges Group no more owns all flocks
    of birds than the Coca-Cola Company owns all polar bears, as much as they wish
    they did.\r\n\r\nTDC/DTC is copied exactly. If they had independently thought
    of the idea of arranging those letters that way, there would be differences, even
    if they chose the same face. Every little irregularity is duplicated."

  body: "Plagiarism is not copying exactly it involves taking somebody else's work
    or idea and passing it off as one's own. \r\nAnd if you look at the DTC logo it
    does have differences from the TDC logo background pattern, slightly less well
    drawn serifs, broader stroke \u2013 obviously taken from the TDC logo but because
    it has been redrawn badly it is different. The pair that I linked to are currently
    the subjects of an <a href=\"http://www.brugesgroup.com/mediacentre/releases.live?article=9075\">argument</a>
    between the two groups , of course it doesn't help that the two are linked to
    the opposite sides of the UK political spectrum.\r\nDoes Coca-Cola make their
    product from polar bears? Perhaps they farm them in remote locations, do they
    employ herders and what are their dogs like? They could market an organic version.
    The wages for milking polar bears would have to be pretty good.\r\nTim"

    him. He tells me that the logo was already in use by The Desert Troon company
    when their association with the client began. The client is \"investigating\"
    the origin of the logo and how it came to be used by them; hopefully we will soon
    know who presented it to them as their original work."

  body: "Perhaps the problem is that the traditional monogram style is such a longstanding
    tradition in Enlish speaking countries that the odds of seeing such similarities
    is not far fetched. Using the monogram for TDC makes sense because it speaks to
    a typographic tradition.  The \"Desert Troon\" however makes much less connection
    and does not seem to be a good fit.  I have no idea if the similarity is intentional,
    I only say that to me it suits TDC far, far better and that \"DTC\" would be far
    better served using something different.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    such \"logo mills\" do a huge disservice to the graphic design industry.  The
    outright stealing of the work of other designers is another issue and its blatancy
    is incredible to me - and should outrage all designers and the clients being taken
    for what initially may be an inexpensive ride to get a new logo.  How many stolen
    designs have been repackaged and sold to unexpecting clients by LogoWorks? \r\n\r\n-
