  me a little confused...here is what they say \"The secret behind Trade Gothic\u2019s
  success has been the hidden variety of its basic elements: some of its most basic
  letterforms aren\u2019t built according to the \u201Crules.\u201D\"\r\n\r\nwhat
  do they mean by this?  what \"rules\"?"

    of Trade Gothic\u2019s success is that it was a refinement/expansion of one of
    the best typefaces of the Twentieth Century\u2014News Gothic, which was designed
    by a man who spent years refining the best American Gothics of the Nineteenth
    Century."

    There are many variations by many different firms: Adobe, ParaType, Linotype,
    Bitstream.'

    the mark so much it should have a new name. But given the changes in reproduction
    technology and the development of the family a strong argument can be made that
    a faithful reproduction is not what users really need and that Tobias Frere-Jones\u2019
    Benton Sans is a worthy successor. "
