  body: Strokes look almost like Hebrew script. It&#39;s an interesting look, but
    it might not be readable enough to use as a text face. <BR> <BR>It has good motion
    within glyphs, I&#39;d be interested to see how it kerns together. Perhaps alteration
    of the serifs so that adjacent letters like lc U and M nest together with a nice
    squiggle of whitespace would look nice.

  body: This is great stuff. And why wouldn&#39;t it work for text? You might not
    set a book in it, but if people use HELVETICA for text why would they balk at
    <i>this</i>? The half-serifs are great, and very nicely counter-balanced so it
    doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s leaning backwards. And I actually like the flat
    stem bottoms - it gives a nice contrast and makes the design more &#34;progressive&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Your x-height is modest &#40;which means large point size usage&#41;,
    but your color is darkish and your spacing a bit loose &#40;both better for smaller
    sizes&#41;. It&#39;s hard to say which direction would be better. We don&#39;t
    have enough evocative fonts suitable for small sizes &#40;here I mean about 9
    point&#41;, so if you pull the extenders [back] in it might make this a more valuable
    contribution to type, I think. <BR> <BR>Whatever direction you go though, plesae

    have look nice, but too small. Try hybrid numerals. <BR>- Judging form the last

    not login anymore, nor obtain a new password, so I created a new account.\r\n\r\nThanks
    (especially hrant) for all the comments. It helped me me very much to realize
    my final version of the 'Fontin'. \r\n\r\nI've desided to make it free. A download
    link can be requested at my website: \r\nhttp://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html"

    on creating such a beautiful typeface. And thanks for letting me use it!\r\n\r\nBest

    \r\n\r\nI'm please that Fontin (Sans in this case) worked out that well for you.
    \r\nThank you for the kind compliments."

  body: "Hej Joe, just thought I'd give you a compliment as well. :) \r\n\r\nI really
    like the early version, extra friendly-looking font as well. I think a super-cool
    future project would be \"Fontin Friendly\", the extra kind version! :D\r\n\r\nIs
    the font Open Source btw? If it is, then I think it would make for an outstanding
    addition to the League of Movable Type website. \r\n\r\nIt's just so darn fitting
    for that project. "
