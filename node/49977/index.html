For most of this year just about anything sold well in foreign markets better than it did in domestic markets. Doesn't matter the product, as soon as the dollar drops in value as bad as it did this year, start selling over yonder. Anywhere other than NA is going to keep you in the game. Don't know about tomorrow but for a while now and right now, tapping into it is the best option. 

What fonts do Europeans want? US dollar fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">FYI: In Europe the ‘Jingle Envelope’ does NOT exist. In other words: Mortgages can not be dissolved by sending the house keys to the bank — banks in Europe are more prudent when loaning to people, thereby protecting those that don’t have the means to pay back their debts. Some countries even have special guarantee funds to cushion mortgage defaults and so on. 

Even more remarkable for Americans may be the fact that Europeans in general don’t like to be in hock and prefer to save before purchasing luxury goods. We have a positive savings rate (as does Japan). The US has the reverse: a per capita (credit card) debt in excess of 20k. Plus a national per capita debt of over 50k because of the overspending of its government. 

Europe’s governments are basically social-democratic, in the sense that the state provides for at least a few basic needs, preventing inhabitants to drop to sub-existence levels. They also have national debts that are regulated to be within managable bounds.

Americans may call this socialism, I like to call it social, because it is anti-social to burden the coming generations with financial debt as well as an environment that will be damaged beyond repair. I still remember how aghast I was the first time I visited the US when I rode the bus from the 42d St Terminal to Newark Airport: the desolation and the pollution of the industrial estates I saw was beyond anything I had seen before… (AD 1980).

Because the US are a huge factor in international trade, the rest of the world has to pay for their foolish ways and the excessive avarice of their bankers, businessmen and politicians. Our only solace will be that this recession will be shorter for us than for it will be for the American people, because we have more financial reserves and the financial sector is far less important here. Too bad that people who are completely innocent will suffer the most (the poor masses of Africa, Asia and South America).

I am sure the next president will be a lot smarter than the present one — let’s hope he will do a better job (and even that is a no-brainer)…

		<div class="commentbody">Burt -- "we" Americans all get tarred with the same brush. Here is another true story about Americans that is just as typical: When my father turned 66, he bought a refrigerator on time (i.e., charged it), to see what that felt like. He decided he didn't like the feeling & paid it off the next month.

From my perspective, it was a western-world-wide change in attitude that started about the 1980s that ruined things. I know, every older generation complains about the younger ones . . .

People don't take it seriously, but as an observation, monarchies seem to do better than democracies. The pattern with a monarchy seems to be "a good one, a bad one, a good one, a bad one . . ." -- a pattern rarely achieved in a democracy. The only trick with a monarchy is to be born during a good one.</div>

People don't take monarchy seriously because people believe what they're told to believe, and politics is subject to fashion just like anything else. The denialism concerning the inadequacy of democracy is in fact precisely democracy's final "closure", fostering a hermetic system where people think they're in control of their societies/lives, naturally developing an aversion to seeing the fatal flaw: that people are qualified to cook, build houses, make fonts, serve food, etc. and not qualified to grasp politics. If one wants to grasp politics, one must be trained to be a politician.

Democracy thus seals the fate of the poor peons who are perpetually voting, expecting improvement, because, after all, they're the ones making the choices, big and small. People don't like admitting they don't know what they're doing. So what becomes very difficult for them to see is that the choices they're given are pre-determined to avert true change, to avert true divergence from the hermetic plutocracy they're stuck in. Essentially, they get to choose between "Original" and "Mint" toothpaste. In contrast, monarchy is easier to fix because when it's bad there's a groundswell of palpable discontent where nobody is being fooled, and this discontent will eventually explode in the face of the tyrants. That might sound necessarily bloody (which is not always the case) but is a short spurt of violence not preferable to interminable servitude? Democracy is the slow death of dignity. And the more hermetic a democracy, the more likely that change must -and eventually will- come from outside.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, well, to somewhat tie this to the original post, what sells well (i.e., getting elected) isn't often what is best for a task (i.e., running a government).

What democracy did solve was the succession wars. Rome wasn't the only country to fall prey to these. And certain present governments excepted, democracies do seem to generate fewer & shorter wars. You can tell Johnnie Commoner he has to lay down his life for the good of the wealthy only so often, and for a shorter length of time.

But Hobo is a high price to pay for these benefits, as is the font-of-the month club attitude amongst graphic designers. Of course, that whine presupposes you're a type user rather than a product hawker.</div>
