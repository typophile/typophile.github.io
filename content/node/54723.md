  body: "As the beginner I am, I feel there are some lacks of consistency across the
    font, even when they could be only in my mind.\r\nFirst of all, some characters
    (<em>Futura-like</em> c, e, o, O, Q and 0) seem to me very discomfortable, perhaps
    due to their extreme geometrical ('unnatural') shape I would intuitively try to
    soften and overhelm.\r\nAnother thing disturbing to my eyes has to do with the
    high weight: there are certain unbalances that become evident in the a, e, f,
    z, E, F, G, 2, 5, 8, not to mention the odd \xF8, ligatures and accents, all related
    to the way you manage the boldness.\r\nOne distracting question about the sample
    is that some outlines render ugly because they are not propperly merged.\r\nThat's
    all at a very first sight.\r\nI'll be back later, when I get more time.\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: Wonderful. Thanks for the feedback MarS. This extreme weight is indeed tricky
    and causing me many headaches. This is my first typeface so the criticism is much
    needed.
