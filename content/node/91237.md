body: "I am searching for the font used on callsign and speed placards of at least
  Airbus A320 series aircraft. Good photos of it are available on [[http://airliners.net]],
  one example:\r\n[[http://www.airliners.net/photo/Frontier-Airlines/Airbus-A319-111/0381506/]]\r\n\r\nThe
  best result would be a free or cheap font, as I am only going to use this once for
  one placard. ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help and have fun to find this
  one!"
