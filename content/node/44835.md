  a fragment of an good example at Tal Leming's site:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typesupply.com/portfolio/typefaces/united/\r\n\r\nI
  am sure I have seen a similar spec sheet for the USAAF taht this free font is based
  on, all done with straight lines, but can't now locate it.\r\n\r\nhttp://hans.presto.tripod.com/fonts/usaaf.html\r\n\r\nI
  could probably reverse-engineer but wondered if anyne could help."

    someone on here will though.

    Marks Applicable to United States Air Force Aircraft. There's a copy [[http://www.freeflightdesign.com/pdf/TO_1-1-4.pdf|here]]
    (5 MB PDF). For Navy and Marine Corps, it's MIL-STD-2161(AS).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    USAAF (US Army Air Force) specs would date back to WWII or earlier and might be
    hard to find. There are probably WWII enthusiast web sites or news groups that
    could help with those.\r\n"

  body: "Many thanks Gus!\r\n\r\nI did actually mean USAF not USAAF.\r\n\r\nThat's
    a very interesting document, but given the level of detail elsewhere, it's surprising
    that the guides to the letterforms themselves are quite basic!\r\n\r\nAs you say
    there are specialist newsgroups - looks like military modelling and flight sim
    people might have leads..."

  body: "You're welcome, Elliott. I did some more research this morning (anything
    is better than working), and found an earlier manual that was on the street in
    1941, although the available copies are from the 1949 revision. The manual number
    is TO 07-1-1, \"Aircraft Camouflage, Markings, and Insignia,\" and copies (US$15-$20)
    can be bought at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eflightmanuals.com/detail/itemList.asp?cID=4528\r\n\r\nhttp://www.esscoaircraft.com/product_p/16427.htm\r\n\r\nThere's
    a book titled \"Usaaf Aircraft Markings and Camouflage 1941-1947\" that's on [[http://www.amazon.com/Usaaf-Aircraft-Markings-Camouflage-1941-1947/dp/0764302469|Amazon]],
    but it's US$58.\r\n\r\nWikipedia has [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_identification_aircraft_markings|an
    interesting article on WWII aircraft markings]] (the color bands and unit insignia),
    but it doesn't cover the lettering.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.tlai.com/med_des/modeling.html|This
    site]] has a number of geometric aircraft fonts that look pretty authentic."
