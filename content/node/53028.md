  elegance in this modern world?\"\r\n\r\nGreater Albion Typefounders has been established
  to do a little bit to overcome one of the many crises facing the world today. We
  (The Typefounders) can't make a dent in global warming; we don't know where to start
  with the Global Financial Crisis, but we thought we'd \u2018have a bash at our own
  little bit of the crisis in design. To us, modern design all seems so bland. Sure,
  it works, sometimes it even works well. But there\u2019s seldom a sense of style,
  seldom a hint of elegance unless you call severe blandness \u2019[elegant simplicity',
  which isn't a line of thinking that ever impressed us. So we decided to do something
  about it- we decided to bring you new Typefaces that honor the spirit and style
  of the past. Want to be right up to date with a brand new typeface, but right in
  tune with the spirit of designers trained in classical ascetic values? Then why
  not try us and see what we have to offer.\r\n\r\nWhat we will offer is new designs,
  replete with Edwardian Fun, Victorian distinction, or any other piece of elegance
  we can manage. Come along for the ride!\"\r\n</cite>\r\nHopefully this captures
