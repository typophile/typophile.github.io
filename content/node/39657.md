body: "In PoeticaStd and several other OpenType Adobe fonts I've been looking at lately,
  there are several glyphs that have no Unicode mapping (they aren't listed in the
  font's internal 'cmap' table)\r\n\r\nFor instance, glyph index 977 (0x3D1) has no
  Unicode mapping. The only reason I'm aware that it exists is because I was looking
  up the glyph indexes in the OpenType 'ordn' feature and it lists index 977 as a
  replacement for index 66 (which has a Unicode mapping of U+0061).\r\n\r\nSo I guess
  my question is, is there any way (outside of InDesign or other OpenType 'aware'
  programs) that I can type in a keystroke and access this glyph?  Or perhaps it's
  intentional that these glyphs aren't allowed to be accessed that way?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!\r\n"

  body: On am Mac you can access these characters from the Character Pallette in the
    Keyboard menu (usually displayed as a little flag in the menu bar). select from
    the popup menus in the pallette View>Glyph and Font>whatever font you're trying
    to access these hidden glyphs from. Then scroll through the display frame and
    double click on the character you want to enter into your active text insertion
    point on the next window below. Entering characters this way can crash some older
    programs, but works fine with Text Edit. Sometimes you can copy/paste from there,
    but that won't always work with some other programs. They can be fussy..

    where you can access all the characters you have in your typeface."
