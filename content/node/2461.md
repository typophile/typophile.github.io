    without some background information. Such as is it a musical group or a lawyers
    office?

  body: 'Hi Nevine. <BR> <BR>Nothing wrong with straignt type. You&#39;ve done a nice
    job picking caps and italic lowers that are close in weight. <BR> <BR>However,
    I&#39;d choose something other than Trajan. Particularly since it is type only.
    There are so many great Classic Caps to choose from. Consider the following: <BR>
    <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/forum-titling-rr/">Forum
    Titling</a> &#40;Funky Trajan&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/serlio/">Serlio
    LH</a> &#40;Has small caps&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/aeneas/">Aeneas
    Light</a> &#40;My pick of the group. Check out the alternate R&#41; <BR> <BR>Several
    other classics have alternates and swashes that could lend some interest: Centaur,
    Bembo Titling etc. <BR> <BR>Now, your italic is Berkley Oldstyle. Don&#39;t know
    if that swash p ending is stock or not. It&#39;s a good idea, but I&#39;d make
    the loop open from the stem. Plus, I would use a more calligraphic in nature,
    like Centaur&#39;s arrighi italics. It offers a light weight, nice swash possibilites,
    and my instincts say it will work better. Consider other layouts &#40;ie. not
    one long line '
