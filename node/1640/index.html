		<div class="commentbody">Some more thoughts on anti-intellectualism in American youth culture.  <BR> <BR>I remembered a study (it is in the book by Chubb and Moe on Politics &amp; Education) of how American high school students progress. They tracked how much students 2nd year students progressed over then new two years, by class academic quarter. The top quarter advanced more than two years. The lower quarters progressively less, with the bottom quarter knowing less than they did two years before! <BR> <BR>This confirms my feeling that the hostility to learning doesn't affect top students that profoundly.  <BR> <BR>I have read that some black students are ostracised by their peers for 'acting white' if they excel in their studies, but this is a special (serious) problem for one group.   <BR> <BR>The hostility may well affect the middling and poor students, but in a way that is hard to tease out. Two of my children have been top students, and but one couldn't have cared less about her studies. Her view was that in high school most kids were just turned off by school in general, and found it boring and pointless. She feels that the youth mass media does have a big impact, but that a bias against academic excellence is hard to differentiate from the general malaise.  <BR> <BR>Another problem in understanding the impact and what to do to counteract it is that different schools are very different. For example, poor urban and rural areas have much more severe problems than suburban schools.</div>

And it's not restricted to high-school. The fear of appearing intelligent in the US is present through college, and all the way into working life. It's more important to have big breasts and run fast. <BR> <BR>&gt; some black students are ostracised by their peers for 'acting white' <BR> <BR>There's a very good reason (not related to doing good in school) that many black people (or really most any minority member) mind when a fellow black person acts white (it's called being an Oreo: black on the outside but white on the inside*) - it's called assimilation in case you haven't heard. We Armenians call it White Genocide. Frankling for example was guilty of it. <BR> <BR>* There's also &quot;banana&quot; for Asians (but I prefer using &quot;twinkie&quot;), and &quot;coconut&quot; for Armenians: white on the inside, hairy on the outside.  :-) Derogatory terms? You betcha - assimilation is the worst thing in the world after massacre and deportation. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, William's point was that among some black students excelling in studies is seen as 'acting white'. This observation does not require an analysis of ways and means of resisting assimilation, it is enough to understand that, for these people, academic success = acting white, acting white = bad, ergo academic success = bad. The reasons why acting white = bad are irrelevant in this observation, because the issue is <i>why academic success = acting white</i>.</div>

To be able to say that historians can hide genocide is to acknowledge a relationship between history and actual events, and to accept that this history can be more or less accurate. If a genocide occured, and is hidden by some historians, we can say that historians who do not hide the genocide are more accurate. All this is possible only if you accept that it is <i>true</i> that the genocide happened. <BR> <BR>Yes, techniques of history can be used to falsify the record of what has happened &ndash; although outright lying works just as well &ndash;, but Ophelia Benson's point is that such bad history can only be challenged if you accept basic standards of truth. If you abandon these standards, then you have no grounds from which to resist the people who say that the genocide never happened.</div>

The conspiracy theorist in me might even say it was all Capitalism's idea in the first place, although that's admittedly iffy. But certainly, once something is in place, no matter where it came from, Capitalism usually ends up squashing it if it's bad for business. So the survival of forced public education (and its further evolution into a babysitting and brainwashing mechanism) is fraught with negative implications. <BR> <BR>And why do you think college isn't mandatory?

		<div class="commentbody"><i>In France that word is officially used in relation to the Armenian Genocide. In other countries, including the US, it isn't.</i> <BR> <BR>Lots of people in the USA, including professional historians, refer to the Armenian genocide. Many also point out some differences between the Armenian genocide and the Jewish genocide, e.g. that the Armenian genocide was not racially based in the sense that race was understood by the Nazis (i.e. as genetic rather than ethno-linguistic), and that the Armenian genocide was territorial: the Turks massacred Armenians in a particular locale and did not express an interest in killing every single Armenian anywhere in the world. These distinctions are important &ndash; good historians should always identify distinctions and nuances, since the particular is by nature more precise than the general and so more likely to be accurate and supported by specific evidence. People who claim that these distinctions are sufficient to deny the term genocide in relation to the Turkish massacre of Armenians are indeed pursuing an agenda. Then one must ask what their intent is. If they are concerned that using the term genocide for territorial, non-genetically* inspired mass murder might diminish the full horror of the term when applied to universal, genetically inspired mass murder, then we should seriously consider that concern. One way to address that concern is to remain clear about the distinctions, and to acknowledge that there are different types of genocide. In fact, the nature of genocide &ndash; literally, people killing &ndash; depends on how the perpetrators define the uniqueness of the people that is their victim (genetically, ethnically, linguistically, culturally, or a specific combination of these), including the definition that those whom they kill are not people at all. <BR> <BR>* I dislike using the term 'racially', because this accepts a distortion of the traditional meaning of race, which is ethnicity, applied by the very 19th century proto-geneticists whose ideas informed Nazi 'race science'. Since I can't use the term race to mean ethnicity without risking confusion with genetic concepts of race, I try to avoid it altogether.</div>

The Newcastle report recommended this type of education on the grounds that the labour market required a supply of &quot;persons thus minimally qualified&quot;. <BR>Meanwhile, the Public Schools Act and the Endowed Schools Act (both concerned with fee-paying schools*) were shaped by the Clarendon report, which suggested that &quot;classical literature is the staple of English education&quot;. <BR> <BR>*In England, both public schools and private schools are fee-paying. The equivalent what Americans call 'public schools' are known here as 'state schools'. (The fee-paying schools have recently started referring to themselves as 'independent schools'. This is of course ludicrous, and heavily wighted against a real understanding of their true status). <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Words have usefulness beyond their formal meanings. The Jews are lucky (or maybe it's not luck at all) to have exclusivity to &quot;Holocaust&quot;. The word &quot;genocide&quot; on the other hand is indeed usually used for the Armenian Genocide, but it's not exclusive - and of course the Holocaust was also a genocide. <BR> <BR>As for the Turkish ambitions (which have in many ways remained the same), there was Pan-Turkism, which was the desire to create a large empire that spanned all the Turkic peoples all the way to Mongolia (where they came from less than 1000 years ago), so the racial basis was in fact there. But it was an excuse. The real reason is the usual reason: money*. The <i>visible</i> Armenians (in Constantinople) were wealthier than the average Turk (although our rural majority was in fact getting increasingly poorer, due to harsh governmental repression) and that caused resentment. The resentment was amplified with religious differences, and exploited. The poor Kurds were even recruited to massacre us - little did they know about choosing sides&hellip; We had been living peacefully under the Turks for 600 years at that point, and the resistance efforts in the far East of the country were only a result of repression (just like in Gharapagh). Just look at the names of the towns in the eastern third of Turkey: they're Armenian - and they're where my grandparents were born. <BR> <BR>* In fact the same could be said of the Holocaust: all the &quot;racial purity&quot; business wouldn't have appealed to the average German - they were in an economic frenzy, never having recovered from the brutality of the victorious Allies from WWI. <BR> <BR>Not to engage in one-upmanship of tragedy, but we lost much more than the Jews: not only didn't we end up gaining a new country, but we lost much more than a big chunk of our population - we lost our <i>land</i>, which we had kept for almost 3000 years. <BR> <BR>What's the real twister though is that Hitler used the example of the &quot;eradicated&quot; Armenians (they didn't know they couldn't get rid of us that easily) to justify the Holocaust! You don't hear that very often&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I would refer to what you describe as ethno-linguistic, not racial (although prior to the 19th century race was simply a synonym for ethnicity). There is a significant difference between ethno-linguistic genocide and genetic genicide. Intermarriage, assimilation and religious conversion &ndash; all of which are recognised ways to destroy an ethnic group &ndash; are insufficient 'solutions' for Nazi genetic ideology, because of their belief that race is genetic and survives intermarriage, assimilation and conversion. Hence the logic of the 'final solution', which was really the only solution that would satisfy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>The Palestinians are subjected to accusations of participating in terrorist activities.</i> <BR> <BR>Last I checked, blowing up buses and restaurants full of civilians <i>are</i> terrorist activities. <BR> <BR>There has long been an incredibly silly attempt to define terrorism and terrorists by the justifiableness of their cause. This has led to endless debates about whether such-and-such a group of murderers are terrorists or freedom fighters. Terrorism is a strategy. It should be defined by the action, not by the perceived status of the person commiting the act. Militant Palestinian organisations pursue a terrorist strategy in their war against Israel. Ironically, their greatest hope that this strategy might result in winning them a country must be the historical example of the creation of the state of Israel after a highly successful campaign of terrorism by Jewish militants against the British mandate. <BR> <BR>Just because one is sympathetic to the plight of a particular group of people who employ a terrorist strategy, doesn't magically make them not terrorists. I have a huge amount of sympathy for Catholics in Northern Ireland; this doesn't mean that I don't consider the IRA to be a terrorist organisation. Terrorists are all people who perform acts of terrorism &ndash; the deliberate targeting of civilian life &ndash;, not just people who do so for reasons we don't approve of. And yes, there is such a thing a state terrorism: the deliberate targeting of civilians during war is a terrorist tactic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Certainly, the greatest source of terrorism now is the US (and its satelite states, like the UK and Israel).</i> <BR> <BR>To accept that I'd have to see the extent of evidence of <i>deliberate</i> targeting of civilian, non-combatants by each of these states and/or specific support of such actions by their proxies. I'm not not questioning that such things have been done and continue to be done by these states &ndash; particularly Israel &ndash;, but to label them <i>certainly</i> the <i>greatest</i> source of terrorism only seems possible if one has evidence that pretty much every civilian casualty is a deliberate target. Killing or injuring civilians as a byproduct of a campaign against militant groups, even if the perpetrators consider &ndash; as I suspect Sharon does &ndash; that such 'collateral damage' is no bad thing, does not constitute terrorism. Terrorism is an intentional strategy to produce terror among a civilian population by targeting them directly. [According to this definition, it should be pretty clear that there has probably never been a war in history that did not involve acts of terrorism as well as unintentional civilian casualties.]</div>
