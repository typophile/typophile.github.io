  I say \"The Bomb\" what typefaces come to mind? \r\nThink Fallout 3, Dr Strangelove,
  Indiana Jones, 1940's 50's America, WW2 Germany, The Soviet Union....\r\nAnyone
  who's interested just put down what comes to mind, I'd be very interested to see
  what people come up with\r\nThanks\r\nEdward"
