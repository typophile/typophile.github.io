<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I know this has been discussed a couple of times around here as I read that a 6x8 inches tablet is just fine and that some Typophiles are addicted to it but:
Are Wacom tablets really efficient outside Photoshop and Corel Painter?
Can they really replace a mouse in more publishing design oriented tasks like vector tracing or text editing?
I'm asking because I got tendinitis on the wrist and would like to try a tablet for a relief but I have seen these tablets advertised almost exclusively for drawing applications and sloppy tagging (bamboo promo).
Most of my work is done on Illustrator and Indesign, I do use photoshop frequently but mostly for adjusting the color, sharpness and contrast on photos.

<div class=commentbody>Sure, I know a number of folks who use their tablets in lieu of a mouse, particularly those who have carpal tunnel issues. The only reason I don't is that I generally use the tablet propped on my lap, which makes it fairly inconvenient for using the keyboard at the same time. Slapping it down on the side of the keyboard basically makes it like an active mouse pad, and you can even buy a Wacom mouse and switch back and forth as I did a few years ago (that's when it is REALLY cool and convenient that each device is individually programmable and automatically recognized by the tablet).</div>

<div class=commentbody>i began using a tablet to relieve "mouse cramp" and i love it. now i can't work without it - but i insist on a large one. i found that with a pen i need to get as close as possible to a 1 to 1 scale relationship between monitor and hand.
as noted, the tablet also allows you to work very close to the body, relieving arm reach and shoulder strain.
if you are starting to experience any kind of repetitive stress- wrist, arm, or elsewhere - i strongly advise you to change up the ergonomics as soon as possible, and a tablet is an easy way to do that.
i use it (in tandem with a mouse) for all sorts of non-drawing tasks, and it also allows me to return to mouse tasks with more endurance than i would have with a mouse-only station.
for drawing tasks, of course, it is ideal.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stangely enough, and in contrast to what Adam says, I end up using the mouse when precision is required and the tablet on random other occasions.
This is because the mouse allows me to position the cursor where I want and then let go of the button precisely there whereas with the pen I tend to move the cursor unwillingly while I lift it, messing up the carefully selected position I was at. Anyone else has the same problem or am I just too shaky?
Plus, a pen is obviously not so convenient if you switch a lot between typing and using the cursor because you can't simply let go of it like with a mouse.</div>

yes, this is common for me too - i too end up going to the mouse sometimes when i want a precise stop.
drinking less coffee helps. ;)
as for mouse ergonomics: i love my logitech bluetooth !
it's the smallest mouse i've found and ergonomically perfect for me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One of the unadvertised benefits of the Wacom mouse is that it is a bit lighter. Many USB mice are a bit heavier + if it isn't cordless the slight tension of dragging around a cable means just a bit more work with every movement. It may seem like a microscopic difference but over time it has an effect. I switched to a Wacom tablet thinking that the stylus would help relieve hand stress, but the light cordless mouse was itself enough.</div>

I think Wacom works very well for you, though it takes couple of weeks to get used to.. at first it isn't so easy not to make accidental clicks and move stuff around. :) I also had a bit of a stress in my shoulder at the beginning. I have Intuos3 A5 wide, and I haven't used mouse for over a year now. I work mainly in Indesign and Photoshop.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I've been using a Wacom for everything since 1992, and attribute it to keeping me free of hand/wrist ailments, despite a vast number of hours at the computer.
The reason is:
1. The natural position for the wrist is with the plane of the palm vertical, as when standing or walking. And that's the position used in writing. In mousing, the wrist is rotated 90 degrees, which twists and stresses nerves in the carpal tunnel.
2. When mousing, you're using just one finger for clicking. Any physical activity so exclusive is bad in the long run, because it's better to share the load. Therefore, clicking with a "writing" movement that spreads the work between fingers and wrist is less stressful.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I use the 6 x 8 Intuos.
The only problem I had when I got it was the cumbersome (to me) stylus, the "Grip" pen, that came as standard.
Presumably they did some market research before they came up with it, but to me it was like using a kid's crayon.
You may prefer the more slender "Classic" pen, which has more the barrel width of a normal pen or pencil.
What do other people think of stylus barrel width?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't mind the kindergarten pencil grip pen - pretty used to it - I got one of the metal ones at one point and that didn't work for long - I hate the click button so mine is just gone - one of the nice things about the metal pen was that you could remove the button and replace it with a grip that had no hole in it.
I have gone through a few and I must say I prefer the grip to the classic.

<div class=commentbody>What would be quite nice would a second input for the tablet, so it could be used parallel to a mouse. Well, at least to those few of us who have a tablet on the left and mouse on the right.
I'd have to say that I am the only tablet user I associate with that hasn't transitioned to using the tablet as the primary input. Most seem to use it for all tasks, after a few-week acclimation.

<div class=commentbody>I use the Wacom Intuos 3. Since I work in Photoshop with handlettering/calligraphy a lot, its great for cleaning up lettering. I would find it hard to do with a mouse.

<div class=commentbody><em>I read somewhere that Graphire and Bamboo tablets tend to lag ¿Is it true?</em>
A while back, under heavy multitasking, in windows 2000, on a 1.3 GHz Athlon with 1 GB ram, I'd have to say no, not at all. Unless everything was lagging. But I think that tables can get a reputation for that when people overload their computers with crazy-complex photoshop brushes - which lag with a mouse, too.

I think that notion is a result of users who only have the budget for the inexpensive tablets also having inexpensive computers. Photoshop and any version of Painter pre-IX are not friendly to the RAM-impaired. Learning to use GIMP usually fixes this problems.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Christopher Walken: Thank you. It’s good, as always, to be here. It’s a treat. But this time, it’s extra special because it’s the final show of the season. After how many shows, Jimmy? 505, actually. 505, Wow! I've done it five times - what's that? A drop in the bucket. So I thought, "What can I do to make my mark?" And then, I thought, "Well, I'll sing a song."
singing
"Things have come to a pretty pass
Our romance is growing flat
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that
Goodness knows where the end will be
Or I don't know where it's at.
It looks as if we two will never be one
Something must be done.
You say potato, and I say potato
You say tomato, and I say tomato
Potato, potato
Tomato, tomato
Let's - "
Jimmy Fallon: Chris?
Christopher Walken: Jimmy, wazzup!
Jimmy Fallon: Sorry to interrupt. I don't know if that's how the song goes.
Christopher Walken: What do you mean?
Jimmy Fallon: You're singing the words the same. You have to say, likw, tomayto, tomahto. Tomahto, potahto.
Christopher Walken: Tomahto? What's that?
Jimmy Fallon: It's just how they say it.
Christopher Walken: Okay, I'll give it a try.

You say totahto, I say totahto

Potahto, potahto, tomahto, tomahto -"
Jimmy Fallon: Chris, I'm so sorry. You're doing it the other way now. And I think you have to alternate them.
Christopher Walken: Alternate, shmaltermate! Jimmy, look, they're all spelled the same on the cards. What do you want from my life?
Jimmy Fallon: I think you're supposed to go - potayto, potahto..
Christopher Walken: Jim, how old are you?
Jimmy Fallon: I'm 26.
Christopher Walken: Ouch! Look, son.. sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. Let me show you. And a-one, and a-two - </div>

<div class=commentbody>This was actually the original reason I got a graphics tablet. (Well, I didn't technically have tendonitis, but my wrists always hurt.)
I'm not certified in any way in ergonomics, but I've read <em>a lot</em> about it. Mice are absolutely terrible for your hands, much worse than keyboards, (I can give you dozens of studies that support this.) and one study referenced in a textbook I read showed essentially that graphics tablets were on average the best of any pointing input device in terms of usability and posture and almost as easy to use as a mouse. I find it easier to use than a mouse.
There are some alternative mice out there that are better in general but put a lot of strain on the thumb muscles. This includes joysticks and the Gyration mice. The AerO2bic mouse looks really good and simple. It's expensive though. I've seen some touchscreen desks, and they look awesome, but they're still outrageously expensive.
My general recommendation is get as many different styles of pointing input device as you have space for them on your desk, one of which should be a graphics tablet, and use whichever one you feel like using.
If you're also considering getting a better keyboard, check the [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/altkeyboards/|altkeyboards Yahoo! group]].</div>

<div class=commentbody>Received my Wacom tablet today and fund myself instantly comfortable with it, great response and all.
The only pet pevee would be the USB cable has to be connected on the top side so it collides with the keyboard.

I work with the keyboard and monitor bang in front, and the tablet to the right of the keyboard.
The desk is L-shaped. X is where my elbow is.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>What do other people think of stylus barrel width?</cite>
Same. My first experience was with the classic (slender barrel) stylus at work. Instantly comfortable with the tablet. Loved it.
Bought a tablet for home and got the big fat crayon stylus. Disappointed.
1 1/2 year-old daughter bit the trigger out of the crayon stylus and I was delighted to find you can still order the classic stylus.
I recently converted to a standing work station and I cannot imagine ever sitting for 8 hours a day again. Using the stylus and keyboard at belly-button height is perfectly comfortable, and in fact allows for a little exercise when the toes start tapping and the hips start swaying to the ever-surprising iTunes shuffle!
Oh yeah...I do get that rub on the wrist bone, but it's mildly comforted by a mouse pad...the top of the tablet is propped up by a an old 5/8" thick book to achieve the most natural writing angle for me.
