  help me with some tips on \r\n\r\na) Headline fonts\r\nb) body text (what is the
  english term?) fonts\r\n\r\nMore specifically, I'm looking for a contemporary, technical
  feel, with good legibility. The book is on games of all kinds, so I am not looking
  for \"fantasy\"-type fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Good suggestions. I'd consider Klavika or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11159.0.0">FF
    Avance</a> for body and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Alega">FF
    Alega</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11462.0.0">FF
    District</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Isonorm">Isonorm</a>,
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Pasadena">Pasadena</a>
    for heads.

    video games world.

  body: "Thanks for all the replies. I chose Klavika for headings, captions etc. It
    took me abut 30 seconds to convince the customer to buy it :) I'm still pondering
    on which typeface to use for the body. I've got four alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. Klavika.\r\n2.
    Syntax.\r\n3. Scala.\r\n4. Bembo Book.\r\n\r\nAny opinions?"

  body: I think Meta could work well for body copy, but I'm not sure about pairing
    it with Klavika, I'd have to compare them together. I do think you will need something
    equally "progressive" for the body copy without sacrificing legibility.

    might be able to give you some ideas on a nice pairing with Klavika...
