body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/emienm_3780.jpg]\r\nSo basically I made
  this Eminem fan-art about him being the first true critically and commercially successful
  rapper(Yeah I know about Beastie Boys and Vanilla Ice). And when it came to putting
  some text in the image I got stuck on the typeface choice. I have used Copperplate
  Gothic here but I wanted to ask is it appropriate? This confusion was mostly due
  to someone saying in a thread \" Copperplate is a great font but its used in a lot
  of wrong places\". What do you guys think? Is this appropriate? It looks fine to
  me but I want your advice.\r\nThanks"

    an old face that was used for small text on biz cards 100 years ago, and more
    recently at display size because it was bundled with a lot of apps, and people
    didn\u2019t know any better.\r\nThe problem is that the teats on it are too big
    at display size, giving such typography a clumsy appearance.\r\nSo the experts
    will always consider its use in display as inappropriate.\r\nBut if your client
    likes the way it looks, feel free to ignore them!"

    about Typography and Design, so I thought I should just ask about it. I changed
    the typeface to Agency FB, for the simple reason that it was the typeface that
    most resembled (There are subtle diffrences but it was the one that came the closest)
    the one they use at Shady Records(Eminem's Record Label) website. Thanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/emienmnew_4961.png]"
