body: I design wine labels and some are very nice but I stink at typography. I am
  often blown away by my competitions use of type. I am not talking about designing
  type or reworking it. I am talking about what fonts to select and interesting compositions.
  I don't understand how they consistently bang out great design. Often their type
  choices are clean and classic. Any tips on how I can improve so I can remain competitive.
  Books, web sites references. How do kick butt designers do it?

  body: "Wine labels are one of the last bastions of classic typography. I myself
    was about to start a thread asking people to post their favorite wine labels,
    so the genre is one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nDo you have an example of one of your
    own?\r\n\r\nThe obvious answer is to look in the [[books]] wiki entry, specifically
    for Bringhurst's [[Elements of Typographic Style]]. "

  body: As been mentioned by the above two posters, Robert Bringhurt's Elements of
    Typographic Style is the "bible" of typography. Read it from front to back, and
    you'll have a greater understanding (and appreciation) for typography.

    to the color books, I prefer [[Leslie Cabarga]]'s \"The Designer's Guide to Global
    Color Combinations\". The pallets presented are more natural, and are richer,
    than plain old static color combinations because he resources classical and natural
    pallets from the world around us. "
