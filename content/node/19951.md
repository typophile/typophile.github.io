  for a client in which the prevailing style is left-aligned, un-justified type. \r\n\r\nThe
  cleint's company have just been introduced to the new style and they are moaning
  about not being able to justify or centre-align text with the new guidelines!\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of or have some concrete material that I can use to convince them that
  left-alignment is both more elegant and more legible than a centred or right-aligned
  column? Also interested in any benefits of un-justified type (although I know this
  is debatable!)\r\n\r\nSomething like a case-study would be ideal. Anything that
  concentrates on legibility benefits is really the key thing!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you ask me FL/RR vs justified is a matter of taste and also can depend
    on the usage. For narrow column measures justified type can be problematic because
    you end up with word spacing issues as  you sometimes see in newspapers or mags.
    Justified type is cleaner though and you don't have to deal with rag issues. \r\n\r\nWhat
    is the job? And why are you resistant to justified type?\r\n\r\nCentered type
    is fine for heads or for short bits of text like captions, callouts, or blurbs
    but can be very annoying to read in longer paragraphs.\r\n\r\nRight aligned type
    can be effective for heads perhaps but not for running text.\r\n\r\nAlso with
    either centered or right aligned text it can be hard to distinguish paragraph
    breaks."

    I\u2019d say \u2018scottish\u2019 words are pretty short),  there\u2019s nothing
    wrong with full justification.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019ve designed
    the templates, the non-design people should have no reason to complain, they don\u2019t
    have to worry about design if it\u2019s already designed. Especially ragged left
    text requires some eye.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of un-justified type come visible
    when there\u2019s a very narrow column or when the language is something like
    German or Finnish, with long words."

  body: "One reason for not using centered or ragged right text is that it is harder
    to read. When the eye gets to the end of a line, it needs to travel back a distance
    (hopefully not too far) to get to the start of the next line. If that starting
    point is always at the same position on the x-axis, it speeds up reading. Ragged
    right and centered text mean the eye must return to that position, and then work
    across to where the text eventually starts.\r\n\r\nNon-justified type, as has
    been mentioned, should not be a problem in good typesetting. But in word processed
    documents, where hyphenation programs may be suspect, and users often double space
    after a period, you can easily wind up with a space between words, or at the end
    of a sentence, that is much wider than the eye expects. When it hits this, it
    acts like a brick wall. The reader stops reading, wondering if something should
    be in this space, as it looks big enough to contain something. Eventually the
    eye starts up again, and continues, but the delay from bad spacing can be significant.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Your client has a point if they have multiple usages. Could you imagine an
    invitation only Flush left rag right, no, that is a place where centered type
    is appropriate. Justified is a matter of taste but point out the down side is
    rivers of white space in each paragraph. No don't make hard fast rules but make
    rules that fit the needs of each kind of communication project your client has.
    In a way you could make more money because this is a lot more work in explaining
    how and when to use a certain style.

  body: I suppose that I can just chime in here for the sake of contribution. I typically
    prefer justified texts or well balanced ragged lines, and for a current project,
    a short newsletter style publication, I chose to go with ragged right. This is
    something I have not done for a while, and I was reminded as to why. Even though
    I was writing all the content on my own, which gave me the freedom to edit words,
    line lengths, paragraphs, and what not to make the proper fit, I felt it was still
    just as difficult, if not harder to achieve a well balanced rag all the way down
    the page. Although, at this point, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised
    with how nicely the columns have come out, and how the publication looks overall.
    I set with Chapparal Pro for the body copy with variations of Frutiger for section
    headings and sub-heads. I also intermingled more artistic typography, pertinent
    to the content and overall design of various other bulky sans serifs.
