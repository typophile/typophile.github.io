  programs for the Fall of 2008. The main institute I am looking at right now is the
  University of Reading in England. Thoughts on this school? Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nI'm
  also wondering what people's opinions on taking a Graduate program for a subject
  you're interested and fluent in vs taking a program you are interested in but not
  overly fluent.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help! I sincerely appreciate any input
  you have."

    program, but for your quoted question: I think that a graduate program is considered
    a master-y level, and this suggests a solid basis of knowledge in the field. Most
    masters programs require a considerable amount of prior knowledge, generally acquired
    through an undergraduate degree."

    at people who have a passion for info/graphic design but who have a degree which
    is not necessarily in a related feel.  They aim not only to train you in the requires
    skills and harness your passion but also to allow you to bring new thoughts and
    approaches from your old discipline.  LCC has an excellent reputation and my personal
    experience of it was very good.\r\n\r\nWill"
