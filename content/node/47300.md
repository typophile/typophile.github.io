body: "Yes, yes that's right.  I am taking over.  What am I taking over?  Why, the
  Internet of course.  Bit by bit, I stalk the back roads and hitherto untraveled
  byways of the web.  I have aspirations toward world takeover, that doesn't mean
  I'm not a fantastic person.  One whom everybody should get to know and adore.  Adore
  and take out for pizza.  Really good pizza, I have standards.  \r\n "
