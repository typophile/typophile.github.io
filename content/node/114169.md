body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\ni'm pretty new to Open-Type-Scripting and I'm doing an experiment
  for a university project where I'm trying to substitute Characters.\r\n\r\nFor Instance
  in my font I don't need Uppercase Characters so I do stuff like this \r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsub
  A by alpha;\r\nsub N by eng;\r\nsub I by dotlessi;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSo this makes
  it possible that I can type an dotlessi character on my regular keyboard.\r\n\r\nI'm
  currently doing this stuff in Glyphs.app but have no idea how to enable this in
  my exported .oft font.\r\nMoreover for my \"experiment\" I created my own OTF-Feature
  called \"phon\"\r\n\r\nSo, since I'm new to this I have no idea how to enable this
  substitution of this characters in my final font.\r\nE.g. I'm talking about the
  fact that when I give this font to anybody I want it to automatically work with
  the subsitution stuff, without enabling any features in InDesign or whatsoever.\r\n\r\nCan
  you guys give me feedback or some insights on that?\r\nE.g. I've also tried adding
  my scripts to the \"liga\" feature, that works in Glyphs, but when I export the
  font as opentype and enable ligatures in InDesign it still doesn't replace my characters.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance,\r\nsepp"

  body: If you want it always, and you're making the font, you should just put the
    eng outline in the N character. Opentype substitution is meant to preserve the
    original plaintext, so even if you made it work, it would be essentially the same
    as that. If you wanted the plaintext to be altered while you type, such that if
    you then changed it to Times New Roman it would still contain the new characters,
    a font can't do that.

  body: "If you put the eng in the N character slot and type N, you get and eng. But
    if you change the font, it's going to revert to an N because it's still encoded
    as an N, regardless of what's displayed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think there is any
    OpenType feature for simple substitutions like that which is also enabled by default."

  body: "Thank you for your Feedback.\r\nFirst off, I get now that I can't make up
    my own feature! However I wonder if there are OTF Features that are \"on\" by
    default?\r\n\r\nImagine this: I'm buying a font and ligatures like f f are always
    replaced by ff automatically, right? At least that's how I have it in mind. I
    don't have to enable this feature in any way. It just works.\r\n\r\nI wonder where
    I could put my character substitutions so the work automatically when I hand my
    font to somebody?\r\n\r\nI always understood that OTF substituion doesn't replace
    the actual character, just displays a different one. but that is exactly what
    I want.\r\n\r\nFor your better understanding: \r\nI'm working on a kind of phonetic
    alphabet where I'm trying to create logic inputs for weird diacritics and stuff.
    E.g. sub degree u by uring; which is a u with a little ring on top.\r\n"

  body: "<code>liga</code> (ligatures) is on by default, but I'm not sure if one-to-one
    substitutions are supported with it. It's designed for many-to-one substitutions
    (e.g., f i > \uFB01 or f l > \uFB02). It should work for the example you give
    in the last paragraph. I've many other fonts that use <code>liga</code> in this
    way."

  body: If ligatures already work in the software you're using, it's because the feature
    is on by default in that particular software. Other users may have turned it off,
    or use something that doesn't support it (fortunately liga is the most commonly
    supported feature). You are making a font that will have to be distributed with
    a set of instructions anyway, so those instructions should include what features
    to have on.

    you do in the privacy of your bedroom is your business. But don't ever make up
    a font that will (1) have any distribution, and (2) has erroneous character encodings.
    And that seems to be what you're proposing. The glyphs will be accurate only when
    your font is used, at the expense that the characters are all wrong in your file.
    As soon as someone changes fonts with your text file -- to any other font -- the
    wrong character will appear.\r\n\r\nWe've been all through this with PostScript
    Type 1. The result was (1) errors, and (2) a lot of extra time and money spent
    getting things right. Whythehell do you think Unicode is necessary, anyway?!\r\n\r\nAs
    an experiment, fine. To print out something where the underlying *file* will never
    see the light of day, fine too.  (Though it would be better just to program a
    custom keyboard, and use proper Unicode in the font itself). But to let such a
    font loose in the world, no.\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit:</cite> Here's an analogy. I'm
    your professor. I'm going to give you an \"A\" for your work. But on a keyboard,
    the \"A\" is way over on the left, where my weak little pinky finger is. For my
    ease, so that I can use my strong pointer finger when giving grades, I'm going
    to switch \"A\" and \"F\" in my font (rather than make up a custom keyboard).
    \r\n\r\nWhen I print out your grade for you, it's an \"A\". But when I turn my
    files in to the university for your permanent grade records..."

    you click on \xAB\_Latin Script\_\xBB and \xAB\_Singhala Script\_\xBB, you simply
    change the font that renders the text.\r\n\r\nOf course, since the underlying
    text uses the latin alphabet, if you copy some Sinhalese text from that page and
    paste it in TextEdit, Word, etc, you get the text it the latin script, unless
    you have the right font to render it. Also, if you search for a word in the Sinhalese
    text, you need to type it in the latin script, else it is not found. Since the
    font used in the search window cannot be easily changed, you can hardly avoid
    that inconsistency, else a properly modified keyboard layout might be useful.\r\n\r\nFor
    young people that grew up in America and know Sinhala because it is spoken at
    home, but have had no education in the language, that may not be a bad choice. "
