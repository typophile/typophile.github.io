    although your sample looks a bit bolder. A stroke might have been added, or that
    weight gain might be a product of the vinyl cutting process.\r\n\r\nhttp://emigre.com/fontpage.php?STrbR.html"

  body: "Thanks for posting. Yes, it seems that the typeface used has a lower x-height
    as Tribute, but it's really close...\r\nit can also be what you are saying that
    it \"gained weight\" in the \"vinyl?\" cut process.\r\n\r\nPatty."
