    you look at all the fonts, they should all come with their own specimen book,
    set in that font's family. \r\n\r\nYou can even enter your own text (up to 22

  body: "Monotype (and many other sites) sell the complete Adobe font catalogue, too.
    They put together a printed catalog listing all of the fonts in their Adobe collection
    a few years ago. It might now be 100% up to date (i.e., Arno Pro and Hypatia Sans
    might not be inside it), but I'll be it is close.\r\n\r\nI can't find the PDF
    of this catalogue on Fonts.com or Linotype's website, but FontShop Germany's got
    it. It is 21 MB. Please look at this; it should be far more up to dat than the
    PDF on Luc's site \u2013 http://www.fontshop.de/news/pdf/Adcat_Final.pdf"

  body: "Up until sometime in the mid-90s, Adobe had the dandiest little catalogues
    they would send you with nearly every product or font you bought. You'd have the
    type, a few lines, and most important of all, the package number -- only if you
    have the package number can you quickly find the folder you want on Font Folio.
    Then, for some reason nobody could ever figure out, they revised them to delete
    the package numbers, making them almost useless. Then they stopped printing them
    at all. In those days too they had the Font & Function magazine, which came out
    quarterly and was available to practically every registered customer. \r\n\r\nAdobe
    can unquestionably afford to make these products again, and they certainly sold
    a lot more fonts in those days. They made it <em>so much easier</em> to find a
    type or just browse and get interested in a type. Lots of corporate customers
    who had little interest in type bought type because of Font & Function. I find
    these resources infinitely more valuable than pdfs."

  body: AFAIK Adobe doesn't have a comprehensive printed specimen along the lines
    of, say, Font Bureau or Canada Type, but their specimen books for Arno and Garamond
    Premier are superb, and obviously descended from the little white covered catalogues
    Bill refers to. I also recall a pocket-sized booklet they produced fairly recently
    on OpenType which showed a lot of their faces, so they may have something appropriate
    available. Thomas, Miguel?
