body: "I've been battling for days with this. I'm sure it must be something very simple
  like a cache issue. I'm on Windows 7 and my three weights all have the same encoding
  settings, yet the Medium appears to have some symbol flag set; the icon shows up
  differently. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Symbol font_6155.jpg]\r\nWhat can
  I do to make it look right? I've finally managed to get the weights to list properly
  in InDesign though goodness knows what I did that fixed that. I can post images
  of the Font Info boxes if that would help?"

  body: "<em>the Medium appears to have some symbol flag set</em>\r\n\r\nIt's possible
    that this is the case because the font has \"Symbol\" selected as its Microsoft&reg;
    Character Set; at times, FontLab on its own decides that this is the case, so
    check your Font Info &gt; Supported codepages and default character set to make
    sure that the MS charset matches the other fonts. "
