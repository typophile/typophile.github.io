    also be \"monospaced regular\" or just \"regular\", couldn't it?\r\n\r\nOther
    opinions?"

  body: "EDIT:\r\nWhat do you think which Interstate Compressed style it is?\r\n\r\nThere
    are \"light\" and \"regular\".\r\n(I never was very into that lettering thing
    so I couldn't even imagine how many different typefaces there are with such little
    differences between 'em and it's hard for my untrained eyes to see them)\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.de/sukr.php3?ch=%2Fsearch.php3%3Fns%3D1%26sns%3D0%26searchtype%3Dfo-kw%26searchtext%3DInterstate%26area%3Dbooks%26action.x%3D0%26action.y%3D0%26action%3DSuchen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
