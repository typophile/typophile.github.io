body: MyFonts has launched the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/">WhatTheFont
  Guru Forum</a>, a companion to the site&#39;s popular online font identifier <a
  href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/">WhatTheFont</a>. Users can upload graphics
  to the WhatTheFont system which automatically finds the closest match in MyFonts&#39;
  database of 39,000 fonts. If the machine fails, the image can be automatically forwarded
  to the new comfortable forum where a group of volunteers is regularly helping identify
  the fonts in question.  <BR> <BR>Due to problems in maintaining the old forum software,
  MyFonts has closed the remaining online discussion <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontForums/">forums</a>
  and directs participants to the excellent <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/">Typophile
  forums</a> as an alternative. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam Twardoch
