  body: I think this is custom work. I don't know if the designer behind this started
    from scratch or an existing typeface though. I found <a href="http://www.contemporarycrafts.org/pdf/2007_03_identity.pdf">a
    PDF at their website</a> in which there are an "outlined" version of the logo.
    There you can have look at the details to try and determine the source...

  body: Ah, thank you for that. Credo is close enough for my purposes for now; client
    is an architectural firm.
