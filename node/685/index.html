For instance, a study of the sidebearings in Futura, how they differ for vertical stems, curves, and diagonals, is very instructive of the whole principle of  font letterspacing, and most obvious in Futura, because of its very geometric from. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;what would be the minimum level of qualification and experience for a person to tutor design students on typography? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's too complicated to answer here.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Adobe has been pretty responsive to employees saying, &quot;I can see how that would make business sense, but I believe it would be unethical and violate our company's core values. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do appreciate what Adobe has done, such as creating PostScript and making my career as a type designer possible! And in my experience it's a class act right down the line. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, because Adobe is such a dominant player, and its foundry is a minor part of its business, even small things it does in the font market can create waves, which others can ride, or get washed out. It's rarely immediately apparent what's for the greater good, which is open to discussion anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dumping is a real problem (and of course others do it, eg Bitstream Odyssey, which I participate in, thank you very much.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When a company gives away (or sells at very low cost) large quantities of old, cheap, or &quot;non per-unit&quot; royalty fonts, that has a negative effect on the market, especially for its competitors. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me give you three examples. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. In the early '90s, Adobe bundled a collection of faces (many ITC) on Illustrator CDs. This really poisoned the font market, not to mention type culture. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Many times, I have had publication designers say to me &quot;Nick, such-and-such client doesn't want to buy your fonts, which I have used in my comp, because they already have the Adobe library.&quot; This is particularly galling for us, because Adobe has few good new news head faces (their stuff is strongest for corporate, advertising, and book work). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. &quot;Type Classics for Learning&quot; is not a good proposition for educational culture. In the first place, because the fonts are &quot;non-per-unit royalty&quot;, they are not the best Adobe has to offer. I haven't seen the list, but I would imagine most of them are somewhat out-of-date, and not yet back in fashion: is that really the stuff to give students to work with? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Secondly, with so many fonts, schools, universities and colleges will be inclined to think that they've covered the bases. Nothing could be further from the truth. Adobe's fonts are great, but they are conservative and mainstream. Surely students should work with fonts that cover the gamut of foundries (as I posted earlier in this thread). I don't know what's on Classics for Learning, but I can tell you that on Type Odyssey 2 there is not a single pixel font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Educators should be encouraged to provide students with a full spectrum of fonts, and Classics for Learning discourages this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I propose that the type industry as a whole should put together a &quot;suitable for education&quot; package(s), containing the work of many foundries. Perhaps this would be a thankless bureaucratic task, but it would be better in the long run. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or how about &quot;Indie Fonts for Education&quot;? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Realize that your argument is one that doesn't 'jive' well with American Capitalism. We're all about selling the most product at the cheapest price with the most profit margin.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I completely understand everything you are saying, but what can you do? You can make a stink, but that's really not going to change anything anyone does, unfortunately.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your three examples are all justifiable complaints coming from an independant type designer, but they're equally justifiable realities (and maybe even benefits) for the graphic designers/clients.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember, most people don't want 'the best'&hellip;they want 'the most affordable'. Sad, but true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My personal view, as a graphic designer, would be to embrace the 'don't pay until you use it for a real job' idea. Nearly impossible to police, but I like the concept. It would allow a designer to use many more typefaces for client presentations. It would, in theory, allow an obscure, independant typeface to end up on a client's list of picks and lead to a license of said font. Something that may not have happened if the firm would have had to purchase the face up front. I'm sure there are a lot of problems with the concept as well, though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Anonymous - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for your insights. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From my point of view as someone who comes from an art direction / graphic design background, from all the way back in the days when type was 'comped' by hand with a variety of Magic Markers or sometimes even gouache with a real paint brush, I have a different view. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are today countless online type sampler interfaces, for getting monitor-resolution samples of your text, just as you'd like it. Or close enough for a 'comp' for presentation to sell the job. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plus, we (and I'd bet most or all other foundries) gladly set samples and provide .JPGs when asked. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In our case, we even provide FreeHand/Illustrator files with the outline characters, for a small fee, if someone needs a high resolution file. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So my opinion as someone who has been in art direction for 30 years, and offers the above to great reception to people in need who then quickly become customers, is that you're being creatively lazy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And going out of your way to justify software piracy (which is criminal by definition) to prop up your own laziness. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the comping stage of a job, having the actual typeface in your font menu and doing a presentation layout (a 'comp', or 'comprehensive' layout) using the real type (or a clone) doesn't make your work any more creative or acceptance to clients.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clients don't care about anything except whether the creative development is attuned to the marketing strategy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the idea of using real type at that stage might seem necessary, but it's not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If a concept has a need to set lots and lots of type (such as for a repeating or endless looking background), budget to buy a suitable type. Or use an OS font and fog it a little to get through the presentation stage.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be sure you have adequate money allocated in your design budget for buying the type you will need to accomplish your project professionally. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your client wants 'the best'. Your client will not know what you as designer need to achieve 'the best' unless you tell them. And back it up with a professionally delineated quotation for advance signature to proceed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If a font isn't available on an online type sampler, such as ours at  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html">http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not available for rental (a rarity), or 'on approval' (equally rare), and you can't get a foundry to talk to you and provide a sample, I can tell you here's the absolute next best thing: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go to Staples or OfficeMax, etc., and buy a box of 12 Pilot Razor Point pens. Get some regular typing paper. Get a ruler and with a light pencil draw two or three parallel lines for each line you need to draw. Have a t-square and drawing board? Great, you're in business. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Of course, if you have a drawing tablet like a Wacom, and are adept at electronic brush and cut and paste, that's great, too. Is it better? Depends on your skills.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then, sketch the type you hope to use in your concept. Scan your sketch and add that to your layout. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this era of scanners, since the inspiration to use a certain typeface is likely some printed piece you've seen, scan the type from that. Go to the foundry's web site and look at the missing characters. Sketch them and add them to your scan. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While this might seem tedious reading, it's the kind of thing that actually takes less time to do than talking or writing about it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And you know what? Sketching it is actually more satisfying than sneaking around collecting fonts surreptitiously. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plus, it puts the emphasis back on open-ended creativeness. Not simply forcing you to choose from what you have on your pirate CD, can get from a complicitious friend or colleague, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've written this this way because you sound like you might be an art director or graphic designer. If you're not, here's your chance to work like a design professional: Professionally. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is about your career, and the difference between bringing crime into the workplace, or doing your job in the most creative way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

That's the point. You need to appeal to the laziness of the consumer. ;o) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;So the idea of using real type at that stage might seem necessary, but it's not.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again, if the type isn't important at that stage, then it's not important at any stage in the client's eyes. I have to completely agree with the client's stance that 'I have Helvetica and Times, let's use that for our ID system' argument. Saying &quot;well, I really think you should consider licensing this typeface across your company&quot; AFTER the client has approved the concept isn't going to be a very compelling argument. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Your client wants 'the best'. Your client will not know what you as designer need to achieve 'the best' unless you tell them. And back it up with a professionally delineated quotation for advance signature to proceed.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No. Clients, like most consumers, do not want the best. They want the most affordable/convenient. That's a reality of the American Consumer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both the designer and client tend to think 'yea, the extra $200 for the nicer typeface would be nice, but Arial Black is good enough.' <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Sketching it is actually more satisfying than sneaking around collecting fonts surreptitiously. &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it really takes a bite out of your billable hours. ;o) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, Joe, I completely agree that font piracy is bad, illegal, and not a good thing for the industry. But do realize that preachin' that is a waste of breath (er&hellip;finger stamina) as those that pirate know that they are doing it and you're not going to change their mind ;o)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joe, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for your response, and your contribution. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, I should clear up a misunderstanding (I wasn't clear enough in my previous post). I'm not talking about using pirate fonts for getting through a presentation to a client to get a job - if the font is suitable enough to be included in my presentation to a client, then I'm prepared to pay for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use pirate fonts to experiment with on my own machine, at the stage where ideas are being tried just to see how far they go. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(In many cases, my work is not static or printed work, so magic markers are not going to get me far even at this stage). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You say that I'm being 'creatively lazy' and 'going out of your way to justify software piracy (which is criminal by definition) to prop up your own laziness' <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK, well I don't justify software piracy, I just live in the real world. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I work the way which is most efficent for me to work. Laziness doesn't enter into it (You could equally call yourself too lazy to protect your fonts properly - it would also be neither helpful nor true). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm sure your font creation skills are as professional as you claim, but its the 21st century now and you need to bring your software distribution skills up to a professional level too. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All I'm doing is offering you an insight into how some people work so that you might start to think creatively about how to sell more fonts through improved customer service initiatives. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you shy away from this kind of approach because you fear being ripped off by pirates, then, in my opinion, you'll lose many potential sales, and you'll still be ripped off by pirates. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Try something like this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I send you reciepts for fonts I've purchased over the last year - so you know that I am the kind of person who buys fonts, not a pirate. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next you make your fonts available for me to download. From then, every time I start playing around with ideas for a new job, your fonts are included in the pool of fonts I'm using in this experimental stage. The chances of me using one of your fonts increases dramatically. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe independent foundries could get together to agree a set of shared criteria which would qualify someone for 'trusted font user' status. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have to accept that pirates will rip off your work - this happens in almost all indutries and there's not much you can do about it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You also have to accept that this won't be any worse if you adopt a generally trusting attitude than if you adopt a generally mistrusful one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Yep. That's the point. You need to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;appeal to the laziness of the consumer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designers today have more tools than I ever did, as I entered the field of graphic design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yet, what a big bunch of babies, content to trade their self-worth for trading software illegally in the dark. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I have to completely agree with  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;the client's stance that 'I have  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Helvetica and Times, let's use that for  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;our ID system' argument. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->God help you if you have that kind of client (unless their grandfathered corporate ID program dictates those; that's another story). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But if so, then use those. Please do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(It's a guarantee that your peers will be doing more standout work anyway. So, go to it!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->:-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; Your client wants 'the best'.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Not more than he wants &quot;inexpensive&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, that's right. Clients do need education. It's not a designer's responsibility to be a 'yes man' unless the client says 'do it just like this, or I won't pay you'.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regardless of how surly some clients might be, they will generally respect you for knowing how to act like a professional within your craft. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you never see that, and never act accordingly, it becomes much more difficult to advance professionally. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Try something like this: I send you reciepts for fonts I've purchased over the last year - so you know that I am the kind of person who buys fonts, not a pirate.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next you make your fonts available for me to download. From then, every time I start playing around with ideas for a new job, your fonts are included in the pool of fonts I'm using in this experimental stage. The chances of me using one of your fonts increases dramatically.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anonymous, honestly, I appreciate your thoughtful, detailed post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe you are being forthright in offering such receipts.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, receipts can be fabricated. And you're starting the discussion from anonymity. Would such supplied receipts have all contact information blacked out? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The foundries you are ripping off have in many cases, spent thousands of dollars to produce 'try before you buy' type sampler environments online. Sometimes tens of thousands, in design, programming and maintenance. Not to mention the ongoing costs associated with keeping it available as close to 24/7/365 as possible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, indeed, bringing type marketing into the 21st century. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it does, coupled with the other 'reaching out' services I mentioned above, constitute quite a lot of support to the type using community. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plus you always have the opportunity to easily scan characters out of catalogs and assembling headlines for ads, etc. It's not that hard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;If you shy away from this kind of approach  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;because you fear being ripped off by pirates, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;then, in my opinion, you'll lose many  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;potential sales, and you'll still be  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;ripped off by pirates. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would counter with this:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want to believe that it is appropriate to rip off the intellectual property of others, when the law says that pirating software property is a criminal act, then you will lead yourself into criminal behavior. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It will be a personal decision and a career decision that you make, adding criminal activity to your resume. And to your repertoire. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And there's nothing anyone can do to stop a personal decision like that, until you're ultimately stopped in a very public way, by enforcement. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Maybe independent foundries could  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;get together to agree a set of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;shared criteria which would qualify <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;someone for 'trusted font user' status. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In marketing, such criteria already exists. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's called becoming a 'paying customer', and then going on to becoming a 'repeat customer'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Believe me, paying customers who become repeat customers get catered to. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using a forum like this to foster the belief that such piracy is 'widespread' could be viewed as tantamount to using the internet and computers as a vehicle to organizing criminal activity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds amazing to me, too. And yet&hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, Anonymous, sincerely, thanks again for your considered thoughts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please step back from your activities and consider the widespread 'reaching out' that foundries are already doing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For **your** benefit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

I've now had time to read your post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nice try with the suggestion for hand-drawing comps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My experience drawing comps matches your own. I still do the occasional comp by hand &ndash; but only for stuff that will require custom lettering to finish it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with rough comps versus &quot;finished&quot; is that the expectation of most people &ndash; clients and art directors/designers &ndash; is that you use one extreme or the other.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, if you're going slick, you combine a photographic image (most likely a thumbnail from an online royalty-free stock agency), with typesetting in an appropriate font &ndash; if not the one ultimately desired. The danger here is that if the client likes the comp,  the finished piece ends up using the royalty free stock image rather than commissioned original work, and the same font as in the comp. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alternatively, if you're going high-concept, the comp can be really simple, a &quot;cartoon&quot; in fact, in which case the choice of typeface also is not crucial. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And one of the reasons for this is that comp rendering skills are a dying art. At school, it's tough to get students to do thumbnail comps, i.e. to think with a pencil. They prefer to think with a mouse. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't like to be so negative, but the old way of doing comps is unlikely to make a comeback. Art Directors just don't  do things by hand, the sensibility no longer exists &ndash; look at those finished headlines you see in ads, set in a &quot;handwriting&quot; font, where no-one is bothered that, say, two adjacent letters are identical. It would be so easy to write the headline by hand, scan it, and drop it in. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

When I buy a font, I'm buying 2 things, the actual physical font file, and the right to use someone else's intellectual and creative effort (the embedded creativity, if you like). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You say that I shouldn't use either of these (even for experimental purposes) without having bought the font. Yet you think it would be OK to scan in the letters from a specimen book and use those scans. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would that not, in your terms, amount to criminal abuse of someone else's designs?

It's done on computers and it has to have the sleekness and perfection of the almost finished product. That isn't always a good thing (less room for imagination) and yeah, there are exceptions, but Jesus, reality is going to the client with the job almost done and THEN going into the process of changing stuff, not the other way around anymore.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the only option is to buy fonts, just like artwork, software, services and other stuff, up front. That hurts, especially if you don't get the job.

		<div class="commentbody">Joe&quot;I do think yours is a significant suggestion.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My own big problem with it is this:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Receipts can be forged;&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK, well purchases on a user account can't <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe again&quot;Another way that 'Anonymous' could build trust, is spend, say $500. or $1000. with a foundry and then ask for further breaks. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In business, 'established accounts' often get additional perks. Again, the customer or prospect has to start by demonstrating responsibility alongside desire. &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is just what I'm saying, only I buy a lot from smaller foundries - my purchases with any one foundry are usually small &amp; infrequent, but if there was a scheme where they could share the info on what I had bought from them collectively, maybe I could get some of those perks. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is beginning to sound a bit 'I want, I want', but this idea is for their benefit as much as mine, remember. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe again:&quot; A large segment of the user community [if the assertion is true that (I'm generalizing here) most graphic designers out there working do actively pirate fonts] isn't really showing the type foundries that it can be trusted.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe, I'm not sure if you have a wide definition of 'active piracy' or if you are misunderstanding me. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I (and probably many others) use pirate font files for experimental work - playing around to see what face looks right for a piece of work (as I said earlier, I would purchase any font which made it as far as a presentation to a client). But I don't BUY pirate font files, nor do I CIRCULATE pirate font files, nor do I hack, crack or otherwise mess around with font files. If you still see this as piracy, OK, but I just don't want you to think there are hordes of designers out there pirating fonts - people just use what's easiest, and leave it to their conscience to decide if and when they should pay up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are certainly fonts out there that I have only ended up buying because I already had a pirate copy on my machine.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant boldly went, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Pure hypothetical fantasy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry, sir, but you are precisely wrong.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know which of your giggly entourage is feeding you the disinformation - because you can't possibly be festering all of it yourself - but you should at least be conversant with the topic yourself before replying. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I happen to be conversant with it, or I wouldn't be yapping about it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Or at best, over-the-hill methodology. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wrong again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(And HD Schellnack had added,) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;(&hellip;)you simply cannot work with rough font scribbles in a presentation. (&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way - to clarify, in case I was too subtle - I was not really focusing in my last post on the hand-drawn comped lettering so much as on the free ability of the graphic designer in need, to use online typesampler type.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or to actually talk with their CD and/or client (since some are client-contact) about getting a working budget established for working tools&hellip;.such as fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But to address Mr Papazian's remark, &quot;over-the-hill methodology&quot;, the hand-drawn approach certainly is not over-the-hill.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How can a designer's own creativity - the hand drawing - be 'over-the-hill' in a design and presentation process? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If it were, there wouldn't be scanner and software makers falling all over themselves since 1986 to market approaches to get hand drawn art into the computer, faster, easier and with optimal quality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's technology that's readily usable in comping type for layouts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But again, in my last post I had focused on online sampler type as a perfectly good option, assuming that drawing might not be everyone's cup of tea. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A lot of art directors, after all, actually cannot draw. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, if they're not comfortable with drawing, use one of the other approaches. As long as one is not pirating fonts, or copying for the purpose of reproducing to sell resultant fonts on the open market, it's highly implausible that one of the approaches would ever cause any friction with digital foundries or other rights holders. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plus, when it comes to getting a comp done, they're fast.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it keeps one from compromising one's integrity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Nicol said, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;When we use to do layouts with felt markers,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;paint and brush or pencil there was more  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;flare to the artwork . The customers imagination <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;filled in the blanks and they felt that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;they had some input into the design process. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's absolutely right! Those are all wonderful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As is bringing the client into the process, instead of just feeding it to them and hoping they bite. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant said, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Do you think I'm independently wealthy?(&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nope, I don't care about that, and I wasn't talking about it in that way at all.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was merely clarifying my position on the earlier retort, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The question is, can you put your discomfort  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aside enough to work with reality, not against it?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to what was really just an aside on my part.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And I don't expect you to understand the concept. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;But Joe seems to think text fonts are  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;only distinguished through their set-width&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Once again, I have no idea where you have pulled such a fantastically untrue and quite ignorant statement like that from. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anonymous, I really don't know what I can add. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;If you still see this as piracy, (&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using the fonts without permission, before buying a license, especially when you yourself pretty much agree that it is piracy? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, I guess I do still see it as piracy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But more importantly, pretty much all of the civilized world does, and has said so through its laws and law enforcement. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Despite that, I do appreciate your thoughts on it, and the snapshot of your own experience and how you choose to run your career. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's something else about this idea of 'make all the fonts openly available, and I'll pay when I actually use something' idea, that occurred to me this morning: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Anonymous had said this, on August 19: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;What is the point of the post?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Well Font foundries, especially the big ones,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;should be aware that the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;'don't pay until you use it for a real job' method <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;is quite widespread, so maybe they should  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;look into legitimizing it. &hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Say we started using that approach. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today, you freely downloaded what you thought you needed to complete your exploratory for your asssignment(s), free of charge. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What if you were to use $400. of our fonts tomorrow, get the ad approved and produce it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then, you die suddenly of natural causes, on Thursday. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Say your use was instead, just $29. That you had actually successfully used just one font, and intended to pay for that one font? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What would be our chance then, of ever getting paid for the high quality products of ours that you availed yourself of and used successfully? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very slim, to no chance, is the answer.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And were we ever to ever be paid, rest assured that it might not be for at least an additional year, and after much more time and expense to collect what was fairly due to us. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The unexpected, death as an extreme example, isn't the only scenario that might wipe away possibility of payment. Sudden unemployment, that goes long term. The employer is hated and so the designer won't cooperate when bookkeeping calls looking for an explanation two months later of a 'font purchase with deferred payment' and no job number or client code attached. Or the client goes under. Or your sole contact within that company is suddenly fired, and you cannot yourself get paid, or find anyone to talk to at the company about it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All those scenarios occur with great regularity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Potentially a bad enough happenstance dealing with a midsize to large ad agency or design studio. Very dangerous when dealing with a small or one person operation (which most design and advertising firms are - one to 10 people). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's another example: I've had one of the world's largest agencies hold us up for $35. for one year over something like that, before they finally paid.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thirty-five dollars! And this was a company that's part of a conglomerate, where that one office, in NYC, was billing something like $100 million annually.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And we had a P.O. number and an agency Job number and the invoice had been submitted on time and approved by the A.D., who then left several weeks later. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In any event, there are lots of reasons why simply working with your CD and client to establish a working tools budget up front, and paying at the time of purchase/intended use, is a better way of working proactively. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, this really is my last post on this, more leading comments or not.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apologies to the group members who think the design related discussion points should not be in a type-centric list like this. It seemed relevant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
