body: I've done some Internet searches, but all I've got is some big words such as
  "quadratic B-splines" or "cubic Bezier splines". I've examined some fonts and I've
  been assuming that TrueType outlines are controlled by on and off-curved nodes (which
  are easier to adjust), and PostScript outlines by on-curved and handled nodes (which
  feel much more like "Bezier" to me). But I've just found out that most fonts I have
  with the OTF extension are recognized with "OpenType Layout, TrueType outlines"
  and with "(OpenType)" going after their family names (they've got PostScript outlines
  as I assumed). What I've learned from the Internet is that fonts with such info
  should be OpenType TT fonts, with the TTF extension, with "(TrueType)" after the
  fonts' family names; the OTF suffix should goes with "OpenType Layout, PostScript
  outlines" (OpenType PS). Am I wrong or something weird is going with m,y Windows'
  font classifying?

    of drawing \u2013 I think they're drawn clockwise in TT and counterclockwise in
    PS.\r\n\r\nAs for Windows, it considers a TrueType font to be OpenType if it finds
    a table named \"DSIG\" in it, OpenType being a sort-of super-TrueType that can
    hold either type of outline along with a zoo of positioning and substitution data
    tables."

    PostScript outlines are *much* easier to edit than TrueType outlines."

  body: "I agree with Thomas. My first attempts to edit fonts -- with font editors
    that are long since obsolete -- were with true type and were extremely frustrating.
    Ps is a dream by comparison. But ps is weak for presentation of very complex designs,
    so ttf has its advantages. Otf is really just a wrapper for either ps or ttf formats.
    Either flavor can work fine as otf. Bit of history -- ps was the first really
    good digital font format, i.e. Adobe etc. Microsoft didn't own it, so promoted
    the alternative ttf. Even today, fonts packaged with Microsoft products are ttf.\r\nDon"
