  Unfortunately, the author of the conversion could not be identified. There's some
  discussion of including these in Fedora Linux. I have a couple of questions for
  the experts:\r\n\r\n1) I'd appreciate is someone can take a look and let me know
  what conversion tool was used. The otf version string (for Nimbus Regular) is \"Version
  1.500;PS 1.05;Core 1.0.38\". It looks like Adobe FDK was used. Am I correct?\r\n\r\n2)
  As far as I can tell, the conversion was well done. Kerning uses the GSUB/kern method.
  If you have any critique of the conversion, don't hold back.\r\n\r\nPackage here:

  body: "The conversion is not bad, but there's a number of technical issues. I just
    looked into Century Schoolbook in FontLab, and tried to install and use the other
    ones. A few quick notes:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Some ISO Latin codepages are not supported,
    so there's no language support for some European latin-based languages.</li>\r\n<li>Kerning
    is there, but not very extensive, could be better when using class-based kerning.</li>\r\n<li>Some
    glyphs have double unicodes, this is not recommended.</li>\r\n<li>Some hinting
    errors</li>\r\n<li>The Romanian cedilla/commaaccent issue is not taken into account.</li>\r\n<li>dlig
    feature is wrong, \xC6 \xE6 \u0152 \u0153 are not ligatures but characters in
    their own right.</li>\r\n<li>Not all fonts share the same glyph set.</li>\r\n<li>Font
    names are a mess, especially when trying to use the fonts in Word Mac 2004. Some
    fonts appear in the menu but don't display in text, some are accessible only through
    the style buttons but not all.</li>\r\n<li>Nimbus Sans Condensed doesn't show
    up at all in Word 2003's font menu on Windows and in InDesign because of duplicate
    names.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nedit: Did I really say \"not bad\"?\r\n\r\nJens"

    sounds like the fonts have signficant issues.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Many thanks for the in-depth analysis.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused about the
    kerning issue. It looks to me like the OpenType fonts have more kerning pairs
    than the originals. For instance, a010013l (URW Gothic L Book) has \"StartKernPairs
    998\" in its original type-1 afm file, while the fea file that I exported from
    of the otf has 1851 pos statements in it's kernHorizontalKerninginLatinloo table.
    Does this mean that the unknown person that did the conversion took the time to
    improve the kerning (even though it's still lacking by expert standars), or is
    this some artifact of the conversion to OpenType?\r\n\r\nThe originals are here:
