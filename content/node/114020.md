  body: "On a Mac, taking a screen shot just saves the portion of the screen visible
    on your monitor, so long web pages might get cut off. \r\n\r\nA workaround is
    to press Command-P (Print) and in the print dialog box choose Save as PDF. The
    resulting PDF will be of the entire web page."

    can save a webpage as a PDF where it makes the page as long as necessary for the
    whole content, i.e. no page breaks.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDavid"
