  It's for a small nonprofit that needs a lot of help starting up. I agreed to help
  out pro bono since I don't feel comfortable charging for work at my current skill
  level. Right now I'm just trying to learn as much as I can as I work towards my
  bachelor's.\r\n \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Joyful_6301.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's
  a rough sketch and in need of tweaking but I wanted to see if you all thought I'm
  at least heading in the right direction. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: Joxful? I think you're trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The "y"
    doesn't really lend itself to this solution. The type needs a lot of work too.
    I'd be interested to see what other concepts you're working on.

  body: "yea, I agree with clashmore. Keep going, do some sketches. The typefaces
    don't work together at all right now. I thought they were two separate things
    at first glance. And yea, I get it...the Y is a happy little man, but the way
    it looks now, being all static...it looks like that little man is running from
    something, not being overly happy and jumping up and down. My best advice is do
    some research on logos for evangelism ministries that already exist. And no...don't
    copy, of course, but you might see a good logo that conveys the same overall feeling
    you are looking to convey. Then study that logo. What fonts did they use, how
    did they treat their type...did they even us a symbol? Stuff like that.\r\n\r\nI
    also did quite a lot of pro bono work throughout college, it's actually a really
    great way to get some experience. Portfolio material is a little more important
    at the moment and adding payment into it always adds a whole different level of
    stress to the situation if you can't do this stuff in your sleep."

    only accentuates the weird sloping \"R\"."

  body: "Thank you all for the comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@clashmore:</strong> Yea,
    that's what I felt but I thought that maybe there was something I could do to
    get it to work. I'm going to do some more work on the other concepts this week
    and upload them when I get a chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@cslem1:</strong> I definitely
    need to do more research on it. I'll be researching it this week as well as working
    on more sketches. \r\n\r\nI would like to be able to get some portfolio work,
    but like I said earlier, I'm trying to get my feet wet right now and as you all
    can see from the current logo, I'm not at that place yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>@Liquid
    Sky:</strong> Thanks for pointing that out. I can see when a design doesn't work
    but I'm not at the place where I can tell <em>why</em> it doesn't work. Every
    comment like that helps.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Google "church logos" images. Get some icon inspiration. You can turn a capital
    Y into a one legged person, but I think you'd be better off finding a good set
    of fonts to work with and to create a church type icon.
