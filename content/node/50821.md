    probably the most fun topic title I\u2019ve ever read on this board.\r\nWould
    make a good first sentence for a novel as well."

  body: you're right, that 'y' is distinctive, and definitely not georgia or bookman...

    in the semibold or bold weight. The serifs are pretty flat, and the 'a' is built
    almost right, and the 'y' seems close, all except for the width.\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: "Well I tried it with Semibold, with a little stroke thickening, since I didn't
    have a heavier weight.  You can see from  the comparison (below) that it's not
    quite right, but maybe close enough?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ViyellaUtopiaSquoosh_3592.gif]"
