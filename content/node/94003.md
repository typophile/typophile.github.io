    body: "Hello @Andrej Kr\xE1tky.\r\nFirst I want to thank you for answer my effusive
      comments about Nara; and congrats you for the beautiful typefaces that you have.
      Thanks for working like that, its really a inspiration to see your drawings.\r\n\r\nI
      was really interested in the original drawing of Nara; but I only find some
      images in Typotheque blog.\r\nI'm begining a research about typefaces with really
      abrupt connections in the transition points\u2014and abrupt modulation. I find
      Vend\xF4me, Preissing Pro, and begin to notice that Czech Typographic design
      full my expectations (I know that Vend\xF4me wasn't czech, typophiles). \r\n\r\nSo,
      what I really like to see, was more about Nara original drawings, to feel the
      original drawing curves and to learn a lot from them. But I don't know how difficult
      is to reach that.\r\n\r\nAgain: thanks @Andrej Kr\xE1tky; its really nice to
      keep in touch with the original thinker of that beauty!\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nF\xE1bio

    you willing to come to Bratislava?:-)\r\n\r\nAs far as to the history of Czech
