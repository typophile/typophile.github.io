  am looking for. From my search on whatthefont, the closest I came to was the Superbastone
  family.\r\n\r\nI am actually looking for the traditional typeface of the old scrabble.
  Unsure if the image posted is the one that I am looking for.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scrabble-letters-step-11_6356.jpg]"

  body: I thought I'd check on that. Monotype News Gothic Condensed was too narrow,
    but looked very much like it. Bitstream News Gothic was too wide, and didn't have
    the distinctive capital Q. But Elsner and Flake, Linotype, and URW News Gothic
    all match.

  body: hey eliason & quadibloc, thank you both for your help. indeed, it looks very
    much similar to News Gothic. so different foundry supplies different variation
    of the same font?
