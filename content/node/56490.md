  Garde 18px in height. Georgia is 9 px at the x-height. Are these good proportions?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  how should I lead this? Should I measure the distance from baseline to baseline?
  Or from the baseline of one line to the ascender line of the Avant Garde? Or to
  ascender of Georgia? Or to the x-height of Georgia?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/where_6652.quote.gif]"

    a bit too separated from the main item; maybe close that up a bit. (& lose the
    em dash, too. Using italic is sufficient to distinguish it from the main item.)\r\n\r\npowers"
