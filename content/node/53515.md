  of this (http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/How+to+use) tutorial and the index.html
  example that comes with the files, I have this:\r\n\r\n[edit: How do I post code
  properly?]\r\n[edit: I've uploaded the html here http://textsnip.com/db74db ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll
  files are in the same directory, so the paths shouldn't be the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
  am I missing?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\no~"

  body: "What exactly is the problem? Like is the text not displaying in trade gothic,
    or is it not showing up at all?\r\n\r\nI implemented sIRF recently on this website:
    http://melissadesa.com/ You're welcome to cut bits of that code out to see if
    you can make yours work."

  body: Can you upload the page you're working on somewhere? Not just the code - the
    actual live page.

    I've just got this one to work, but now I have a different problem - the original
    text doesn't disappear!]\r\n\r\nI've downloaded your page and changed the swf
    name (to both the one I created and the tradegothic one that came with it) and
    it doesn't work.\r\nSee here: http://www.descign.com/sifr_is_annoying/Untitled-2.html"

  body: "According to FireBug, you're missing the sifr-screen.css file and the sifr-print.css
    file. These are NOT optional files. They are required in order for your code to
    work properly. Also, you don't seem to have a sifr-config.js file. Are you using
    the latest version, etc.?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nYou're not missing the files! You've
    misspelled the names. :)\r\n\r\nThat said, you really should upgrade to the latest
    version of sIFR, found <a href=\"http://dev.novemberborn.net/sifr3/nightlies/\">here</a>
    (sifr3-r436.zip)"
