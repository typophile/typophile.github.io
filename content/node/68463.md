body: "This started off as a logotype consisting of two letters; 'ei'. It actually
  began as a sans (which I'm still working on) but ended up finishing the serif version
  first.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I have ever finished upper and lowercase Latin
  alphabet and since I have never really studied typography I am in dire need of some
  constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nAlso, have a guess where I got the name from..\r\n\r\nCheers
  in advance\r\n\r\n12/8/2010 - Update - Ive added a few bits and addressed some of
  the issues raised here. Please give more feedback if possible. Also, do type designers
  do all the hinting etc themselves these days, or do most get them mastered by pros?
  Not sure if I have the patience to do 7000 kerned pairs.."

  body: "I like this a lot. It seems very original.\r\nFavorite glyphs: K/k/Q/V\r\nWidths,
    especially of the lowercase, seem a bit indecisive: letters like bdhnpq look narrow
    but a and s look wide.\r\nThe top serif of /G/ jumps out to my eye as unfitting.\r\nIs
    there a reason that /j/'s tittle doesn't match /i/'s?\r\nI'd beef up the serifs
    on the crossbars of E and F.\r\nStay with this, I think it's really promising."

  body: "This is a beautiful font. I can't think of any criticisms eliason didn't
    mention.\r\n\r\nIt's very nice to see such a clean and precise font inspired by
    blackletter script."

  body: I think S would look better if its top and bottom curves were vertically stressed
    (bilaterally symmetrical) to match s, C, O, etc.

  body: "I really, really suck at numbers myself, so this comment really isn't constructive;
    but I'm not particularly fond of your:\r\n\r\n- 3 (tried experimenting with a
    \"normal\" three without fang?)\r\n- 5, 6, 9 (tried giving the bowls shapes analogous
    to the bowl of b?)\r\n\r\nPlus, hard to tell from a specimen like this, but try
    making them all a bit thinner, too.\r\n\r\nThe letters are fantastic though!"
