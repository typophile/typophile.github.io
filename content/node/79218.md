  CD, Video Director, Producer, Songwriter, Record Producer, etc. It's not Futura,
  20th Century, Trajan or Doric. What other kinds?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/(Unknown)%20-%20Still%20023_4843

  body: "Max. I think you need to explain why you need a 100% perfect match for this.
    Are you trying to fake some footage, to pretend it was shown on CMT in the '90s?
    What experts are you needing to fool with these credits?\r\n\r\nIt is a version
    of Futura. There have been many, many versions of Futura since it was designed
    in the 1920s, and this is a version that would have been made for use in high-end
    video editing hardware in the late '80s/90s, so it is not a digital font that
    you can use on a computer. What are you hoping to find? A font with the fuzzy
    edges and irregular baseline? "

    I need Gaylord to fool with these credits. I also need to ask them what kind of
    broadcast automation/on-air playback equipment did they use the credits with.
    What is "tweek"?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/(Unknown)%20-%20Still%20023_4843
