body: "So I am currently performing an exhaustive search over the internet to find
  an internship calling my name in NYC. I'm a senior at the Savannah College of Art
  and Design and am looking for an internship over the Summer of 2011. I will do next
  to anything (my soul is up for bid on ebay as we speak) to further my passion for
  graphic design in NYC. I am very interested in web design, typography, logo design,
  and package design...but am willing to turn to the dark side (joke) :) advertising
  if I needed.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any advice I can take and run with? Or maybe even
  some comments?\r\n\r\nMy portfolio: www.cargocollective.com/eew\r\n\r\nthanks a
  bunch, guys!\r\n-Erik"

  body: "For those seeking work in a city that they don't live in, especially if that
    city is NYC or LA: Recognize that many potential employers will reject you based
    on your online portfolio. Both the work in the portfolio and the portfolio itself
    as a design project of its own. It's very easy for experienced designers to notice
    the warning signs of a lazy designer. And people who look like they might be lazy
    designers \u2014 true or not \u2014 go straight to the discard pile."

  body: "You shouldn\u2019t be chasing an internship in New York if you can\u2019t
    provide a better reason than just wanting to be in New York. Unless there are
    particular designers here that you really want to intern for you can do just as
    well elsewhere. The designers here know that and they are not going to hire you
    just because you want to come to New York. So study up on the New York design
    scene, pick a few people who you believe can really teach you something, and write
    them some brilliant cover letters explaining why."
