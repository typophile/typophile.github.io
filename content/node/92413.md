  working on.\r\nIts an 18 page pocket poetry book, eacht poem is set in 2 languages,
  one is English the other is French.\r\n\r\nThe period when the poems were originally
  written in was between 1914 and 1922. I was looking for a separate font for the
  titles and for the poem itself.\r\n\r\nPreferably i'd like to go for a serif. \r\n\r\nAll
  tips...suggestions are more than welcome. i'd really appreciate all help lady's
  and gents.\r\n\r\n"

    \u2014 which is, \"What's it about?\"\r\n\r\nIs there any unifying theme other
    than the date range? Who are the poems by? What kind of mood do you want to set?
    How long are the poems?\r\n\r\nMixing two serifs is a bit tricky. Must the titles
    use a different face? Must that face be a serif?"

  body: "Hi Joshua, thank you for replying,\r\n\r\nThe poems are written by James
    Joyce, its hard to pin down to a unifying theme, but i guess it all boils down
    to \"life and death, emotion or the lack of emotion\"\r\n\r\nPoems are between
    9 and 15 lines, and approximately 4-6 words on a line \r\n\r\nI would like to
    have it a bit contemporary but with a bit of a twist (no Caslon...etc.\r\n\r\nMixing
    two serifs is not a must, at first i thought about giving the titles a different
    face, or maybe give the French translation of the poem a different face than the
    English version.\r\n\r\nWhen the book is open, left page has the English version
    on it, right page has the French version so its important that they work nice
    next to each other.\r\n\r\nIt must not be a serif but for the french i'd prefer
    a serif. But i'm open for all suggestions\r\n\r\nHope this info helps a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: Somewhat later than the period you describe, but strongly associated with
    the same high literary modernism, Faber & Faber made a lot of use of Perpetua.
    Consequently, it is a type that I associate with Joyce, Eliot, Pound, Jones, etc..

    any sort of consensus. And there is no more potent example of how stupid it can
    be to use the same font for multiple languages than Emil Ruder's \"Typographie\";
    every typographer should study it to see what not to do.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Evie \u2013 The appropriate typeface will depend on the poems themselves.
    I wouldn't worry too much about the historical period (either of the poems or
    of the type) but I would give a lot of thought to what you'd want the poems to
    look like when you read them yourself. Any book design grows out the experience
    of being a book reader.\r\n\r\nOne typeface I've used a lot (and which is now
    available in OpenType format with an extended range) is Mark van Bronkhorst's
    MVB Verdigris. The italic is very distinctive and readable in its own right, and
    at large sizes can make an excellent title face. (Mark has recently released a
    new display version, in roman only, for large sizes; that would be another possible
    approach.) I've used the roman for several books. I don't think it would be inappropriate
    for Joyce, though that is a judgment call that you'll have to make for yourself.\r\n"
