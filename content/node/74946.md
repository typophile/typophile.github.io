  body: "Some stores in older parts of Valletta and Sliema have very nice crafted
    signage. Made of nice wooden frames and glass painted with hand lettering at the
    back. sometimes angel guild is imitated by putting wrinkled aluminum foil behind
    it. More and more these signs are replaced by ugly modern ones, but I am sure
    you can find some and/or posters with pictures of these old shops. I think it
    is based on English (and maybe Italian) tradition, sice Malta used to be a British
    colony.\r\nSecond best thing is diving.\r\nThird best thing is the balcony of
    the restaurant of \"Hotel British\" 40 Battery Street - 267 St. Ursula Street,
    Valletta with a wonderful panorama view over the harbour.\r\n\r\nSorry for my
    bad English, I'm Dutch. Have a very good vacation!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Business-Shop-Front-Malta_5791.jpg]"

  body: "Maltese is an unusual-looking language, as far as those that use the Latin
    script go.\r\nIt has the idiosyncratic \"he\" (h-bar), and lots of hyphenated
    words, doubled consonants, u-less q's, and dot-accent characters.\r\nLots of high-scoring
    Scrabble words.\r\nI would be interested to see what the indigenous script form
    of it looks like, from hand-lettered signage.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eastern_europe_5423.1190214000.street-sign.jpg]"

  body: "There seem to exist two glyphic versions of the capital barred H. One with
    two equal horizontal strokes in the middle, one with a normal H crossed through
    by a bar in its upper half. \u2013 Can you explore this a little bit? I\u2019d
    love to see some real-world snapshots which show the true local feeling for this."

    have to hunt for some natives abandoned shopping list to find that H!"

  body: "The buses were pretty cool, I didn't think to check those properly. There's
    a bus station in Valletta where they all idle - that would be a good place to
    catch them I reckon.\r\nI saw a few nice things, if your into manuscripts and
    such, the museum in Mdina (not the Natural History one, the Cathedral one) has
    a collection of letters and documents from the Knights. Your not meant to take
    photos, but i got a few off discreetly. Hopefull that won't vex anyone too much.\r\n\r\nThe
