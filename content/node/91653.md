  body: "Vector based art work is best because of it can be scaled without loss of
    crispy clean resolution. I could be wrong, but perhaps you're looking for a free
    open-source solid vector software to use? \r\n\r\nI recommend Inkscape.\r\n\r\nhttp://inkscape.org/\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!\r\n\r\nn."
