  />\r\n\r\n\r\nMore details about U8:\r\n\r\nU8 is a geometric sans serif, with 14
  styles, designed by Anton Koovit. Anton started U8 as a research project about the
  Berlin subway system signage and particularly the U8 line that connects the northern
  borough of Reinickendorf with Neuk\xF6lln in the south of the city, through the
  Alexanderplatz junction. His goals were to restore a piece of history, research
  a link between the DIN and Bauhaus, and translate the lettering of individual handcrafted
  station signage into a formal typeface. Apart from the regular weight\u2019s upper
  and lower case, glyphs such as numbers, and other weights, had to be created by
  the designer, allowing for his contemporary interpretation. The result is an early
  modernist typeface, with wider proportions than most common geometric sans, a strong
  character, and a clean design. Initially intended for display purposes, U8 has proven
  to work well in text sizes. The typeface comes with a full character set for western
  and eastern european languages, and a number of OpenType features such as ligatures,
  smaller figures for text, tabular figures and fractions."

  body: "Hmmm. This seems to be lacking a number of optical compensations I think
    of as pretty well necessary, unless... is the intent to do a slavish revival of
    naive/vernacular lettering, even when that is less than useful for quality work?\r\n\r\nI
    am looking at these things:\r\n\r\n1) Where a straight transitions to a round
    looks glued on rather than gradual (hmnu).\r\n\r\n2) Where two strokes join, as
    in a curve to a straight, things get clotted because of lack of thinning at the
    join in the heavier weights (abdghmnpru).\r\n\r\n3) Some letters are getting just
    too dark overall in the heaviest weight and might benefit from selective stroke
    thinning (ag, maybe es)."

  body: "Thank you Matthieu.\r\n\r\nHello Thomas, \r\nYes, U8 is a \"revival\"\u2026
    quotes because, as far as we know, it was not a typeface in a formal medium. \r\nIt
    was Anton Koovit's goal to recreate a design that existed only on signs and keep
    the very particular and graphic feel of the face. All the elements you mentionned
    have obviously been considered and consciously kept in the final design. Having
    seen the typeface used (including for text!) by graphic designers we admire, we
    stand by the choices that have been made. Your value judgements about quality,
    usefulness or slavishness are duly noted, but quite frankly, we don't share them."
