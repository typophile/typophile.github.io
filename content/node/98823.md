  Do you know of a GOOD face that looks like a cross between Franklin/News Gothic
  and Helvetica Condensed, with an x-height that pushes the limit on \"too high\"?
  Available in a range of weights and with an italic or oblique? That works in small
  sizes for short blocks of text?\r\n\r\nPairing it with Sentinel, which is gorgeous
  for the client's purposes.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    they think.\r\n\r\nNeither is too big a departure from their current; each has
    their own personality that might do quite well for them. THANKS!"
