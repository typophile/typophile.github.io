    Gothic&#39;, by fellow Typophile, Christian Robertson.. <i>&#40; Well, Sure, You
    may as well be dreaming.. &#41;</i>

  body: Logicalnot, these Forums are run by people from the type community. <BR>i
    think it would be quite illogical for us to point people to solutions <BR>that
    undermine the work of our very own people. <BR> <BR>You might not realize that,
    but Pill Gothic didn&#39;t just magically  <BR>appear on a computer somewhere
    far far away and miraculously  <BR>made its way to the Veer website. It was carefully
    designed, <BR>digitized, kerned and whatnot by a type designer, a living, <BR>breathing
    person who toiled away for endless hours crafting  <BR>a beautiful typeface which
    performs impeccably in graphic   <BR>and lay-out programs. This living, breathing
    person has rent or  <BR>mortgages to pay, eat and drink, maybe support a family,
    enjoy  <BR>some recreation once in a while. <BR> <BR>Ask yourself, how would you
    feel if someone asked us to provide  <BR>whatever you do for a living for free,
    so you wouldn&#39;t be able to  <BR>earn a decent living anymore? Need I go on?
