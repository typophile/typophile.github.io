  to use it for my sites. I've begun with the site about the [[Fell Types]]. Essentially
  I've added a page about their history. It's far to be exhaustive but it's better
  than nothing. I think I will use the Wordpress' \"post mechanism\" to add other
  infos easily (doing something I haven't done for years!).\r\n\r\nI hope you like
  it.\r\n\r\nIgino Marini\r\n\r\n "

  body: Now that you have gone to all this trouble to design and publish the site,
    you should have the text corrected by an English editor, as it "reads" with a
    pronounced accent. Perhaps an Anglophone Typophile will volunteer, if you post
    a request.

  body: Given that the fonts are free I think we should simply be grateful that he
    has done all this work. That said, it is always good to have a text that reads
    well.
