  is great, of course, but there's a strange kerning value set between the lower case
  f and the open parentheses and brackets. The default kerning here is 126, which
  looks a lot. It can be manually adjusted, of course, but it would be interesting
  to know the reasons behind such a choice.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kepler_kerning01_3785.jpg]"

    is on to something.\r\n\r\nChecking the AFMs for the Light Display masters, it
    looks like in Roman the parenleft-f pair would have a kern on the order of -20.
    But in the Italic, the parenleft-f pair gets a kern more like +110 to +130. Factoring
    in some interpolation, I imagine that's where the +126 value comes from and was
    just accidentally picked up from the Italic and applied to the Roman.\r\n\r\nSo,
    Thomas is right: that would be a bug.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    Robert and he first thought it could be caused by a bad kern value in one of the
    masters. But then we looked at all the Roman fonts in the family and the kern
    value between the left parenthesis/bracket/brace and the 'f' is pretty consistent.
    So, yes it's a bug, but we no longer have enough information to know exactly how
    it happened."

  body: "I'm going back to this thread because I don't want to create a new one about
    the same typeface.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that in Kepler the \"Th\" is set as a standard
    ligature.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kepler_ligature_5173.jpg]\r\n\r\n(above:
    ligatures turned on by default; below: Th ligature manually desabled)\r\n\r\nI
    respect the designer's choice, but from my point of view it would have been better
    to have it as a \"discretionary\" ligature. When set at very small sizes, say
    6 or 8 points, the \"Th\" ligature can be a little confusing to the reader's eye,
    with the two different glyphs resembling one single letter. Who types the text
    can correct them one by one, since you can't turn off a single ligature without
    affecting the others - a hard work if you're setting a book, for example. So I
    believe that having it as discretionary, as someone else suggested (in general
    term, not specifically to Kepler: http://lamb.cc/blog/2008/07/14/css-ligature-support/),
    should help. Just my two cents!"

    done after setting all the text, but it's not difficult.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying
    this to argue against having some way to turn off specific ligatures as a feature:
    I think it would be useful. But at least there is a work-around.\r\n\r\nAlso FWIW

    look, all of them set at 6 points:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TH_ligature_4267.jpg]\r\n\r\nOk,
    the quality of the image is bad - but I still think that the text reads better
    with this ligature disabled, as in the Hoefler Text, Cycles and Whitman examples.
    Though correcting the \"Th\" ligature is possibile with the search function, it
    would be better to have it as a separate choice. I'm on Indesgin CS3, by the way.\r\n\r\nOn
    the same level, this leads me to think that it would be useful to have fonts with
    particular glyph options; I know some typefaces have it. For example, after setting
    a book in Hoefler Text, the author asked me if the Q cap italic could be changed
    with a more conventional one - an alternate glyph could have helped, in that situation.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q_5503.jpg]"

    so you should be using the appropriate one if you're setting text at 6-8 point
    size. I question the validity of critiquing their legibility at such small sizes,
    when variants optimized for those sizes are also available.\r\n\r\n2) Aside from
    that, I don't see a legibility problem specific to the Th ligature in the samples
    shown. Indeed, I prefer it to the spacing created by the Th combination in the
    non-ligated examples. I think this is a matter of taste, though.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    them with a ligature that will be included in the liga feature. Maybe Adobe does,
    I don't know. But if you don't use the ligature, Th is a pair that frequently
    needs kerning.

    but Adobe doesn't kern pairs at all any more, except when they need special treatment.
    They kern classes instead. So in a typical typeface the bhkl will all be in the
    same class for kerning, and will get the same kerning against the T (if any).
    To un-kern the Th combo would actually *increase* the size of the font for no
    gain. Thus Florian's observation.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    values between different masters in MM space. Probably at least one of those masters
    had a significant kern, but some of the middle values might not. IIRC, Adobe filters
    values less than 5 from the exceptions, but it doesn't save any space to filter
    them from the class kerns, so I'm not sure if they do.\r\n\r\nT"

    lot over the (OpenType) years. Probably some (or most) early OT fonts were not
    filtered at all, but eventually we did apply some post-processing to remove kerns
    below some value like +/-2. (The kerns would be commented-out of the input feature
    code.) Probably in some cases that value got up to 5, but I think 2 was regarded
    as pretty safe. I'm actually not sure what has been done in recent fonts like
    Arno. Anyway, I recall that the filter was applied to all kerns -- class pairs
    and otherwise -- for quite a while, whether or not it actually resulted in size
    reduction. It was just a standard production step."
