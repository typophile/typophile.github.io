    a more descriptive title next time. Perhaps read the FAQ. Anyway welcome to typophile.\r\n\r\nSorry
    I don't know the font - shades of Agency but definitely not a match."

  body: "Carplates doesn't have Gridnik's facets, I think they're pretty different
    actually.\r\n\r\nIf \"Gridnik is the thinking man's Courier\" (quote from the
    site), what does that make these other fonts? The poor thinking man's Courier?"

    is the font people buy (usually in the UK as type.co.uk is the only distributor)
    when they can't afford Gridnik or get a hold of The Foundry."
