  body: 'Back in the old days of typewriters, I remember there were two main font
    syles: elite and pica. This appears to be the elite style. You might look at Prestige
    Elite or, if it is too clean, I know P22 has a typeface named Typewriter which
    is a pretty good mix of clean and distressed.'

    font, if you happen to know?
