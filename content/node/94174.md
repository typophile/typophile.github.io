body: 'The July 2012 issue of <em>Scientific American</em> (Advances: How Critical
  Thinkers Lose Their Faith in God) points out that a hard to read font "...promotes
  analytic thinking by forcing volunteers to slow down and deliberate more carefully...".
  People in the study discussed in the article expressed less belief in God compared
  to those who read material in a "clear" or easy to read font. Maybe we have been
  doing this all wrong.'

    usually feature a large number of <em>equations</em>, and these will slow down
    the flow of reading enough that even the most beautiful, legible, and readable
    typeface will not result in the absence of opportunity to pause and think analytically

    very true. I once bought a six-pack of Samiclaus Brown\u2014because that's the

    and a net ABV of 7-8% or so\u2026which I could achieved with Moretti Birra La
    Rossa, which tastes mighty nice right out of the bottle\u2014if you happen to

    of the 'experimental typography' of the mid-90s, which mostly lacked even hypotheses,
    let alone observation or conclusion).

    is the same science that says serifs don't help</em>\r\n\r\nReally? Can you point
    me to the study? I got the idea from a conversation with Kevin, and it is the
    idea that interests me, rather than the particulars of the methodology.\r\n\r\nThere's
    a longstanding anecdotal belief that sans serif type is less readable / less suited
    to continuous text than serif type. But I've thought for some time now that this
    is a problematic assertion because almost all sans serif types were not designed
    for text, and hence it shouldn't surprise us that they perform less well. But
    people seem quick to presume that the reason has something to do with the presence
    or absence of serifs, and I reckon that's not the case or, at least, far from
    the whole story. And one of the reasons I think this is because Legato is so darn
    readable in continuous text. So I know that there's at least one way to make a
    sans serif that is highly readable in a text setting, and I think there may be
    others. Over the years, I've worked on a number of sans serif projects, but they've
    all involved either starting from an existing Latin sans, a particular historical
    model, or have had to operate within a set of technical constraints. And they've
    all been initiated by clients with a specific brief. So recently, as a weekend
    project, I started designing a sans serif from scratch, in which to explore my
    own ideas about sans for text, and one of the first things I've done is to make
    the spacing somewhat looser than a) most sans serif types and b) looser than I
    was initially comfortable with, i.e. I went against the instincts that years of
    looking at sans serif type have left me with. So this is an instance in which
    an idea from reading science -- and for this purpose it hardly matters whether
    it is good or bad science -- served as a kind of mental liberation. The really
    interesting thing for me was that it took about two days of working on the design
    for my mind to adjust, and now I find the spacing very comfortable to work with.\r\n\r\n<em>The
    only way you can gauge the success of your loose spacing is by using the same
    testing methods that supposedly confirm the merit of the idea.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
    not even logical: there are almost always multiple ways to test the same hypothesis.
    But I'll gauge the success of my spacing the same way I would gauge the spacing
    of any other typeface: does it set well and is it easy to read at the intended
    size range. All I've taken from the science is an idea: I'm not committed to a
    programme and I'm certainly not setting out to reproduce some particular experimental
    result.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. I reckon my new sans is very readable, and <em>one</em>
    of the reasons for this is that it is what I now think of as 'spaced for text',
    which is a concept I think most of us understand very well when it comes to serif
    type, but about which I doubt we'll find much agreement when it comes to sans
    serif. It isn't by the way, simpler 'looser', i.e. you can't achieve the same
    thing by tracking out a typical sans."

    be evaluated apart from rhythm and color. Tracy writes that best spacing is a
    function of the width of the counters. I think that's correct, which is my problem
    with Helvetica. Its circular forms have a lot of counter space within the 'o'
    for example, but the space between letters is much less. I think that the space
    between and within letters needs to be visually equal in area for good color and
    rhythm. \r\n\r\nA face that is overly tight by these standards is not a problem
    for display, but I think it is less readable in extended text. \r\n\r\nSerifs
    among other things help you get even color with adequately roomy spacing. When
    you chop the serifs off a seriffed font and leave the spacing as is, the color
    is hurt, and the words seem to fall apart. Hence, as Tracy says, the sans letter
    spacing needs to be tightened, stem to stem. That becomes a problem with faces
    based on the circle, but less so for those based on the oval, because you have
    harmony between counter and spacing, and more even color. That's why 'humanist'
    sans like Frutiger work better in text than Helvetica. One of the sans I find
    most readable in text, Vesta, is also narrower and also 'cheats' by having more
    stress variation, and less of a monoline appearance.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the problem
    of spacing and color is never ideally solved for sans, if what you want is maximally
    readable extended text. That's one reason I think seriffed fonts are inherently
    superior for text. \r\n\r\nIn sub-par conditions such as low resolution screens,

      stuff). Not all by myself, mind you, but by spreading ideas that others might
      adopt and implement.\"\r\n\r\nOut of personal curiosity, I (an amateur) did
      some reading on reading speed. My conclusion, from the studies I found, is that
      there is a wide range of values for most choices that make little difference,
      once within fairly wide threshold values. For example, once contrast above background
      reaches a minimum, then changes in level of contrast (or colors, for most people)
      don't matter much.  Line length, between about 40 and 100 characters doesn't
      matter much. Leading doesn't matter much. Serifs v. sans doesn't matter much.
      By \"matter much\" I mean two things: they are not close to being the most significant
      effects, and the effect they do have is quite small, a few percent or less.
      (Of course, optimizing several small effects can have a substantial impact in
      total.)\r\n\r\nThe two factors that did consistently make a significant difference
      (>10%) in reading speed were letter size and familiarity with the font. \r\n\r\nText
      is commonly set too small for maximum reading speed, and an easy way to increase
      speed is to simply make the text larger, until you run into line length problems.
      \r\n\r\nA reader that is familiar with a font has adapted to read it at close
      to that reader's maximum speed, faster than that reader can read an unfamiliar
      font; even if the unfamiliar font has characteristics that we think are more
      condusive to fast reading. Once the reader is familiar with the new font, the
      two are read at about the same speed. Our brains' base reading functions seem
      to learn to accomodate a wide range of styles and shapes without significant
      impairment - with sufficient exposure.\r\n\r\nAccepting these results means
      that a reader should be able to choose the font(s) they prefer and have them
      be applied across a wide range of disparate reading material; and that text
      size defaults should be increased, and the reader should be able to further
      adjust the size. With those two things, general reading speed is close to maximum.\r\n\r\nWhat
      caught my attention was the ability of a typeface to significantly affect a
      reader's comprehension of a concept. I had not considered this possibility.
      I will accept an increase in reading fatigue if the cause of the fatigue is
      that I am better understanding the content because my mind is engaged more effectively.\r\n\r\n"

    (and origins are always there - results never come from a vacuum) in terms of
    denying the binding of letterforms. As I suggested to Kevin before, in the face
    of powerful, long-standing anecdotal evidence (I'm using the positive, layman
    terminology here) one must actively doubt one's own hypothesis, and basically
    try to disprove oneself. If you fail, then you have a powerful tool. And your
    recent counter-intuitive experience that you describe is exactly that sort of
    commendable mentality.\r\n\r\nConcerning serifs, I certainly agree that thinking
    of this in terms of sans-versus-serif is oversimple to the point of fallacy. I
    have long felt that serifs aren't merely appendages you slap on, they are in fact
    structural. In terms of this discussion serifs are sort of a proxy for the binding
    of letterforms into clusters, since they do promote that. But as you say there
    must be more to it than that, especially concerning the binding of the whites,
    as I agree Legato aptly demonstrates.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the suggestion of
    loose spacing is coming from the same bad place as the suggestion to ignore serifs;
    so if loose spacing <em>does</em> help you, it's just dumb luck.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>there

    the sort of thing Kevin does, but since that's so deficient it's more misleading
    than anything else to rely on it. So you're guaranteed to get \"validation\" of

  body: "<em>It'll be interesting to see if @Hudson's idea of spacing sans-serif fonts
    in a way approaching serif fonts bears edible fruit.</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think
    I would describe the idea in  quite those terms, because it might be misleading.
    The presence of serifs shapes interletter space in ways that play an active r\xF4le
    in the perception of spacing. When spacing letters without serifs, a different
    approach is called for, but Walter Tracy's advice that sans spacing needs to be
    tighter is too much of a simplification, and I also think he was looking almost
    exclusively at sans serif type outside of continuous text. \r\n\r\nThe sense in
    which your summary of the idea might be true is that my idea is that sans serif
    types can be designed for continuous reading if they are able to establish more
    even rhythm between interior and exterior space, which is indeed what we generally
    do when spacing serif type.\r\n\r\nHere's a useful exercise: do a search on MyFonts
    that turns up a lot of sans serif types, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/sans/fonts/\">'sans'</a>
    and view the search results with a good text string for looking at spacing, e.g.
    'nihilim millioon'. Except in the case of condensed faces, you will see that in
    almost all cases the types are spaced such that there is considerable, and in
    some cases extreme, unevenness between interior and interletter white space. From
    this I conclude that pretty much none of these sans serif types has been designed
    for continuous text. For contrast, view the same test string in Verdana and in
    Legato, which for slightly different reasons have notably looser spacing than
    most sans serifs. These are sans serif types that were designed for continuous
    reading."

    but in any case I don't think there is a sufficient comparison set of sans types
    intended for text, and those that do exist tend also to solve different problems.
    I mentioned Legato and Verdana, but I don't think they can be directly compared
    because of the different media for which they were intended, which in the case
    of Verdana strongly influenced the spacing. The most one can say, I think, by
    way of comparison is that Legato has more even rhythm of internal and inter-letter
    spacing than Verdana: a function of having narrower counters.\r\n\r\nI've not
    had a chance to work with Rotis Sans in text, which I think would be necessary
    to make a proper judgement. The more significant problem for text might be how
    narrow and vertically stressed the letters are. Another of my ideas about sans
    for text is that they need to be fairly heavy and with strong horizontal features
    to overcome the picket fence effect of the verticals. Interestingly, while Rotis
    Sans appears very loosely spaced, especially if looked at large, Rotis Semi Serif
    seems to me too tight.\r\n\r\n[At this rate, I'm going to express all my ideas
    about sans serif types here instead of in my typeface!]"

    test passages, with the accompanying questions and answers. Mark up the passages
    with html like < idea> and < easy>. Get a large number of test participants. The

    case, leading, slant, contrast with background, serifs, descenders, lower case
    height, Nick's \"inappropriateness\", ...whatever) then those are not of interest.
    \ For whatever reason, however poorly understood, there is clear evidence that
    that won't be the case for all of the values for all of the parameters. \r\n\r\nThis

    of which might perform better than the other given equal familiarity, i.e. be
    more readable because of some features of the design, it is strongly possible
    that the other typeface will perform better if it is more familiar to the reader.
    In other words, familiarity is what might be called a strong cultural bias in
    readerability. This certainly explains why alphabet reform tends to go nowhere,

    method does not require you to kill the same rat twice.\"\r\n\r\nDon't be silly.
    Rats are bred in huge batches to be identical, so science can kill the same rat
    1,000's of times. Readers are bred in tiny batches to be unique, so science can
    scratch its head. And type designers are bred in even tinier batches so science
    won't have any trouble publishing reams of bullshit about type.\r\n\r\nld: \"The
    two factors that did consistently make a significant difference (>10%) in reading
    speed were letter size and familiarity with the font\"\r\n\r\nBelieve me, these
    two, for normal readers, are all that matters, and the second thing really translates
    into \"familiarity of the font specifier with the audience\".\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you're genuinely concerned that reading two different pieces of text is
    going to skew speed and accuracy results, that hypothesis can itself be tested
    by isolating just the difference in text. Do it a few times, and you'll easily
    establish a baseline of average reading speed and accuracy for different texts
    of similar lexical and stylistic complexity*, not only that, you'll have measures
    of the variance from that average and can weed out test subjects whose individual
    results vary too far from that of the majority of participants. Then you can start
    varying other factors such as type size, etc. and compare the results to the established
    average.\r\n\r\n*Bear in mind that word processing software has been able to automatically
    rate the complexity level of prose writing for at least twenty years, so its not
    like you even need to base the text selection of subjective judgement. And there's
    this thing called the Internet that is a vast repository of text, examples of
    which can be located and selected based on common level of lexical difficulty
    and stylistic complexity."

    to read, the reader subconsciously starts rejecting some of the material since
    their mind is having a hard time making sense of what is being read?  '

  body: That wouldn't make sense of the results, which are rather the opposite. The
    stuff that is harder to read has more impact.

    sort of cliff where type ceases to really communicate, except on an emotional
    level.
