body: so this place is called The Eaves, its an attic like space that will be hosting
  experimental/rock type of music, very independent kind of stuff. i was trying to
  avoid something too generic or like the &#34;scene&#34;. the main type there is
  LHF becker monogram english, but its pretty modified.. especially the E. charlemagne
  is the THE. <BR>thoughts? it will be on backlit light panels, maybe a wood sign.<img

  body: 'I think this is a great start . . . The overall feel of the typeface communicates
    what you are going for . . . <BR> <BR>A few suggestions: <BR> <BR>&#34;THE&#34;
    kind of looks like it is akwardly hanging out there -- it seems like it would
    fit perfectly in the space between the E and the tall swoop of the &#39;v&#39;
    . . . this would make it feel like more of a unit as well. <BR> <BR>The V is hard
    to read -- I thought the name was &#34;Eaues&#34; <BR> <BR>The space between the
    &#39;a&#39; and the &#39;v&#39; is also a bit akward because it is so defined.
    Perhaps making the &#39;v&#39; come to more of a point so it is more readable,
    will also solve this as well.'

  body: ok, i moved the THE, but im not sure if i like it there or not. maybe its
    not in the right spot. i changed the point of the v, and i like that much better,
    but i dont know if it helped the a-v space. if that space was open on the bottom
    or top would it make more sense?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39490.gif"

  body: Hi Ben, <BR> <BR>I think you need to go even more on the V, maybe even move
    it up a bit, also experiment a bit moer with the placement of &#34;THE&#34; .
    . . <BR> <BR>I have attached a quick sample of what I mean with the &#34;v&#34;
    &#40;it&#39;s always easier to show rather than explain, i hope you are okay with
    the visual suggestions . . .&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, you might want to try to post
    this under the &#34;Logos/Corporate ID Design&#34; section . . . I am fairly new
    here, but it seems as though you might get more responses and feedback in that
    section. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39519.gif"
