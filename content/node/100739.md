body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI know this is a long shot but is there a macro or method to
  create glyph components from a mask. I have a large italic font, the accents glyphs
  were made up from components of the base glyph and accent. These glyphs have been
  mistakenly decomposed but I need them as components. I could generate the glyphs
  again with Glyph > Generate Glyphs\u2026 , this would give me the components but
  the accents would be the wrong places. Any ideas."

  body: I'd second a plea for an answer. I have a few fonts where glyphs got decomposed,
    and I'd like to make some changes in the accents -- or occasionally the base character
    -- & not have to reposition everything.

  body: Alas, I don't know of any way to do this from a mask layer. In theory, I suppose
    a script could analyse foreground outlines in selected glyphs, find matching outlines
    elsewhere in the font, and make composites, but I've not seen this done.

  body: 'You might try this: Per each glyph, select the outline which you want to
    convert into a component and then choose "Contour > Convert > Selection to Component".
    If you use the shortcut for this, and also use a shortcut for "Next Glyph" (go
    to "Tools > Customize" which has a search box) to quickly switch from one glyph
    to the other, you can revert to components with not too much work. I have done
    this a few times in the past. (I don''t understand the mask part. Does "Tools
    > Mask > Swap Outline with Mask" help? Again "Tools > Customize" allows you to
    assign a shortcut.)'

    Rachel as well...

    component and then choose \"Contour > Convert > Selection to Component\".</cite>\r\n\r\nJust
    a note: you can't select the whole glyph, say eacute, run the routine above, and
    wind up with two components. You have to run the routine on each component, selected
    separately.  \r\n\r\nDone this way, a change to either of the components will
    be reflected in all the composites based on it. \r\n\r\nExample: if you want to
    change the *e* glyph and all the e-accent glyphs, then <strong>if</strong> all
    the e-accent glyphs are composites, the change to the base glyph will reflect
    that change in all of them. The same thinking if you want, say, to change the
    length or thickness of a macron diacritical. The po0sitioning of each component
    will (essentially) remain.\r\n\r\nGiven most text editing and layout software
    today, as long as authors use Unicode's precomposed accented characters rather
    than a base character and a combining diacritic, this becomes an important tool.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nActually,
    since most font publishers -- including the major ones such as Adobe and Monotype
    -- don't bother with the combining diacritics, authors aren't to blame for not
    following the Unicode consortium's stated preference..."
