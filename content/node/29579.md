  body: I think because in Illustrator, you are not limited to the 1000x1000 units.
    After importing, nodes and BCPs need to be put on a particular (closest) grid
    point, and in most cases you have only a 1000x1000 point grid, so there will be
    trade offs, especially in small details.

  body: "\r\nThis is because FontLab uses whole numbers for the point coordinates.
    The connection is actually as smooth as possible in this \"resolution\". \r\nYou
    can try double clicking the node twice in order to change the it to sharp and
    back to smooth again. Sometimes this produces a smoother connection. If you can
    scale up the glyph it will get smoother, too after double-double-clicking.\r\nIf
    this still does not help try increasing the UPM size. I usually work with a UPM
    of 3000 because this has the smallest rounding errors when I finally change it
    back to 1000 for the font files."
