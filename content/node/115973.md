  body: "It would depend to some extent on how you treat any other text-breaking elements.
    Does the document have subheads? chapter titles? How does the text start after
    them? There is nothing special about an asterism, it simply one more way to signify
    a break in the text. In fact, with or without any particular  typographic devise,
    we always term such \"spacebreaks.\"\r\n\r\nYou need to give some thought to what
    to do when one falls at the foot or head of a page, BTW. That's where too much
    extra space above and below can create a headache, if you're balancing spreads.
    And whether or not to start the new paragraph not only without indent, but a few
    words in, say, small caps. You don't need a club, just to avoid confusion. Work
    spacebreaks out for the worst case, everything else will fall into place as an
    acceptable compromise.\r\n\r\n "

    The book has only chapters, no subheads, and the first paragraph after the chapter
    head is <i>not</i> indented, but all others are.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm leaning
    towards not indenting after an Asterism because it <i>is</i>, after all, a text
    break, and I'd like to be consistent with the other text breaking elements (chapter

  body: :] Unless there is a particular stylistic reason, there is no need to indent
    the first paragraph following a blank line (and neither the first paragraph in
    a text). The indent is first and foremost a method to separate paragraphs, but
    you have already separated it with blank line, asterism, blank line.

  body: "What a designer -- interior designer -- usually does is to set up a form,
    not a mechanical repetition. What do I mean? Well, suppose you indent the chapter
    title 4 picas left. You could then indent the first text line four picas left,
    without implying all paragraph indents are 4 picas. You have sorta kinda suggested
    that paragraphs following a textual break indent, but not \"suggested strongly,\"
    as chapter openers also suggest \"this is display,\" even to the first text paragraph.\r\n\r\nAll
    kinds of variations: For example: you could indent the chapter <cite>title</cite>
    4-5 picas left, with the chapter <cite>number</cite> flush left, and pick up on
    any consistent edge for the first paragraph. Or if chapters have an epigraph,
    dedication, whatever below the title & before the first text line, remember vertical
    alignment. Or a subhead. None of this has any particular implication for subsequent
    paragraphs, esp. if the treatment is obviously different. If it is similar though,
    then you've set up a weak promise.\r\n\r\nWhat you're really doing with a choice
    is suggesting how you'll lead the reader in awkward situations. What if a spacebreak
    is just that (no ornamentation)? And what if it falls at the foot of a page or
    the head of a page? Essentially, without an ornament, you kill the blank line(s)
    How do you let the reader even know that a new paragraph has started?\r\n\r\nWhat
    if a subhead starts a page, and all pages have running heads? Can they be told
    apart, without thought by the reader, as they stack at the top of a page? \r\n\r\nThere
    are all kinds of ways to handle these situations, but using a common approach
    throughout a text -- regardless of exact numbers -- helps a reader, without them
    knowing it.\r\n\r\nOther questions: What's the stronger signal for signalling
    a hierarchy? Beats me. For a very short time, I used to specify A-level subheads
    & the following text flush left, with B-level heads & following paragraph indented.
    Then I took a look and saw just how strong the white space from that double indent
    actually was, visually. \r\n\r\nOr... is italic stronger than roman? Ask 20 designers
    and you'll get about an even divide as to which is stronger.\r\n\r\nIn the end,
    the good designers spend more time helping a reader through a text than with obsessing
    over what they, as designers, like. Since your text in this example is pretty
    straightforward, you have a certain luxury. The mistake would be to think whatever
    answer you choose here will apply to all texts, without further thought."

  body: "<cite>In a book for people today, it doesn't need to look like books bought
    by their grandparents.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, that's true. But if you're going to
    use an asterism, you should find out what an asterism <strong>means</strong>.
    What sort of break is it, <em>why</em> did people still indent after it, and so
    on.\r\n\r\nUsing a few asterisks in a row, as is done in current books, tends
    to indicate the passage of time, but it doesn't indicate a break between subdivisions
    of a chapter. So indenting after that might mislead the reader into thinking a
    hierarchical structure is present - which explains the older practice, even though
    it is correct that not indenting would seem to be superior in appearance.\r\n\r\nUsing
    an asterism instead implies one is consciously attempting to be \"retro\" in the
    design of the book. If you're doing that, don't you want to be consistent?\r\n\r\nMaybe
    indenting after the asterism does look bad, and though should be avoided, but
    it now seems to me that there is a strong case for doing so, and therefore careful
    thought is needed."

  body: I basically agree with you, but would modern readers even notice the difference
    between an asterism and a few asterisks in a row? I doubt it. But I'm fine with
    indenting if you're going for a retro look and feel it's appropriate for the book
    and the intended buyers.

    capital and small caps. Better still to insert a centered asterisk.\u201D\r\n\r\nAgreed
    so far. However, and that's where this becomes relevant for this thread, in its

    etwa eines Sternes in der Mitte \xFCber diesem Anfang.\u201D The English translation
    is somewhat incomplete, and should read \u201CBetter still is the insertion of
    an asterisk centered above this beginning.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo, if I interpret this
    correctly then Jan Tschichold proposes to set the asterism (or asterisk, the \u201CStern\u201D)
    <em>above</em> the new division which would mean to set it at the top of the new
