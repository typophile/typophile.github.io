body: I'm getting rid of some things that were once thriving contributors to my studio
  but are now just dead weight. One thing that will never go away is my Precision
  Type Reference Guide. I only hope I don't completely wear it out. However I have
  two of the Precision Type Fontlink CDs in Macintosh version. Is there any use for
  those at all?

  body: You could always try donating them to your favorite design museum. So many
    firms trash or lose their discs over time that I doubt there are a lot of museums
    with good collections of the stuff. Stanford just accepted a collection of 28,000
    video games, so somebody must want old type stuff.

  body: Thanks for the suggestion JP. I found a museum that is interested. But they
    say I need to bury these elaborate CDs in a landfill so an archaeologist can discover
    them in a couple of hundred years. I only hope they find these mixed in with the
    millions of AOL CDs already in the garbage dump.

    the early digital fonts to eventually be lost because everybody decided that tech
    was so ubiquitous that it was pointless to hold onto their collections.

    big plastic case with a speciman book. There were usually 2 floppies inside one
    screen and one printer. Those 400k floppies were just filled with space you know:-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
