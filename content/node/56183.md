  body: "I have no idea about NY-specific printers, but for the white ink on colored
    paper you have effectively four options - \r\n\r\n1. reverse offset print, i.e.
    start with white paper and print the background on it\r\n\r\n2. intaglio engraving
    - by far the best option, but typically most expensive one\r\n\r\n3. thermography
    - a cheaper imitation of engraving, not bad if the type is thin\r\n\r\n4. silk
    screening - pretty exotic, but if done well it looks very very nice\r\n\r\nSee
    [[http://typophile.com/node/55318|my older post]] for some pretty pictures and
    the replies for some more information on the subject.\r\n\r\nAlex"

  body: "White ink on uncoated colored paper using offset printing is probably not
    going to give you the opacity you desire. I tried this several years ago and it
    was acceptable, but not great. The printer even gave me a double bump at no extra
    charge and it was still only at about 40% of full opacity \u2014 a double bump
    means they printed two coats of white ink. The problem is that uncoated paper
    soaks in the offset printing ink. You could maybe lay down a clear coat using
    the white plate before running the white ink on top of that, but still don't think
    that would work very well.\r\n\r\nBest of luck to you, and let us know how it
    turns out."

  body: "For option 1 (offset print) I recently had cards printed by vistaprint.com.
    Very pleased with the result. I went with uncoated stock, their heaviest paper,
    printed on both sides, uploaded my own graphics - in short their most expensive
    options - and I still paid only $45 for 500 of them. Got them in just a few days.\r\n"
