body: "I'm trying to figure out what the typeface is that they regularly use in the
  Wire magazine. It's the type that says:\r\nSIGHTINGS\r\nHOT CHIP\r\nGEORGE E LEWIS\r\n\r\nCath
  & Phil Tyler\r\nWarrio Queen\r\nWooden Shjips\r\n\r\nand then the line towards the
  bottom, with the lighter weight:\r\n\"What makes today's Techno so different, so
  appealing?\"\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, I really appreciate the help!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.asymm.net/wire_smalltype.jpg\r\nhttp://www.asymm.net/wirecover.jpg"

    but otherwise the same.
