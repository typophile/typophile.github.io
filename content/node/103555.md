  the government. Currently it's just ff Olsen with some minor alterations (rounded
  Corners, shortened ascender and took in the serifs a bit).\r\n\r\nLet me know what
  you think. Is it too plain? awkward looking etc... I think I'm losing the forest
  for the trees on this one and need some feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ci-logo_4741.png]"

  body: Honestly, there was not much thought behind it. I just felt like I needed
    to do something to make it more ownable. I liked the font "out of the box" but
    it's pretty distinctive and I thought I might need to do something to differentiate
    it.

  body: "Again, don't know much about the nature of the client, but:\r\nIf you're
    chopping off a half-serif from the \"el\" (which I like BTW) you might pull that
    off with the \"y\" too. I would also consider making everything (or maybe almost
    everything) flat - I'm thinking top/bottom of the \"C\", bottom of the \"e\",
    and/or bottom of the \"y\" (which might convey an air of stability befitting a
    government contractor).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks again for your feedback. I'll try out a some of your thoughts and
    see where they go.\r\n\r\nAs for the nature of the client; as a government contractor
    they really cover a broad spectrum of services, everything from elearning, web
    development, workforce development, training, performance consulting, etc...\r\nso
    the look has to be flexible enough to work in a variety of environments."

  body: "This is too cute, it has some sort of baby giraffe feel to it. I'd revert
    to the previous version of 'y'. \r\n\r\nThere's absolutely no need to get all
    serifs consistent across the words. It is not a wall of text, it's just a set
    of specific glyphs and while it's nice to have some consistency between them it
    is certainly not a requirement, nor even a priority. I think the version from
    2:38 pm is really good, it matches your brief well, so I wouldn't over-think things
    and simply go with it. It is indeed very good."

  body: I prefer the first version. All that red feels garish, and I like the stability
    of the even-footed {l}. The font looks friendly but professional. And as a linguistics
    nerd, I find macrons attractive.  :)

    \r\n\r\nI was pulled away from this job for a bit. I had time to look it over
    yesterday and made a couple of changes and would like to get your thoughts. \r\n\r\nI'm
    wondering if that space between the 'e' and 'y' is distracting. "
