  but has a sense it has been reduced to its simplest form. Much like Brancusi had
  done with his sculpture series \"Bird in Space\"\u2026 reducing and abstracting
  an idea to its simplest form.\r\n\r\nTwo fonts that come to mind are Optima or Trajan
  Pro.\r\nI know there must be many other great fonts available that I'm not aware
  of that would echo \"Bird in Space\". Any suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/constantin-brancusi-bird-in-space_6352.jpg]"

    then tapering out, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/duffy-script/regular/\">Duffy
    Script</a>.\r\n(Sorry to keep plugging my own fonts, but for some reason they
    come to mind most readily!)"

    get you closer to that sangreal. Maybe that very (in)famous Stop.

  body: "You are thinking about the R leg i Trajan, right? There are plenty of faces
    with such details. Quadraat, Fedra and Bembo off the top of my mind. \r\n\r\nWith
    such a slender shape I would also look at thin stressed sans serifs like SangBleu
    BP Sans.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s something about that terminal that cuts off the curve
    that you might find echoed in other faces. What are you going to use it for?"

  body: Yep, Indra is on to the same lead, but IMO they both look too strict and geometric
    next to the sculpture.

  body: "Thank you to all,\r\n\r\nWOW! this is more than I ever imagined. The ideas
    and discussion has ignited an explosion of alternate ideas that had never occurred
    to me.\r\n\r\nThese are all great suggestions... Duffy Script, Frutiger, Stop,
    Futura, Condor, Aviano, Quadraat, Fedra and Bembo, SangBleu BP Sans, Excoffon,
    Typonine Stencil Pro, Dala Floda, Noir.\r\n\r\nI will have to start working with
    them and see where it leads me.\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\nTo Frode Frank, I'm
    redesigning a logo that has a bad stylization of a bird and has Helvetica Bold
    for the company name. The concept of a bird is the only part of the logo that
    has a connection to the mission of the company. I plan to redesign the bird and
    match that to a appropriate font. I am so grateful for the font suggestions.\r\n\r\nI
    appreciated the link from Riccardo to the comment by William Berkson about Frutiger.
    I've always liked Frutiger and obviously Brancusi's sculptures. It is interesting
    to know the link between the two.\r\n\r\nAlso, Thank you to Riccardo for making
    me aware of Noir. The font is too geometric for what I'm working on now, but I
    was impressed with details of the font and the font defiantly has echos of Brancusi's
    sculptures. I'm not clear if Noir is complete but when it is complete I want to
    purchase it.\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\n\r\nBill"

    For your logo, why not draw something from scratch?
