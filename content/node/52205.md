  pick up at my local craft store. Any ideas? I don't really have any preference on
  stitching or glue or anything, just looking for some ideas to try out.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Jesse"

    of binding are you thinking of? You can make a few simple home made tools and
    jigs to make binding easier. If you want to know what direction contemporary hand
    binding is going in check out The Bonefolder newsletters [a contemporary book
    binders sight with lots of info: http://www.philobiblon.com/bonefolder/index.html\r\nAlso
    look here for some ideas on simple and not so simple hand bound books: http://myhandboundbooks.blogspot.com\r\nThere
    are a number of very good, easy to follow books on home made bindings using readily
    found and made tools. If you can provide some more specific aims then I could
    recommend some books.\r\n"

    work on some journals in the future but for now I just want to put together some
    very small books with normal printer paper, probably a glued spine with a bit
    more sturdy cover...\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    forget about those 'paper craft' style of books you will find in most bookshops
    and look for the titles such as \"The Thames and Hudson Manual of Bookbinding\"
    by Arthur Johnson. This should still be available and it has been invaluable to
    me (I am a bookbinder). Another smaller & cheaper book by Johnson is \"The Practical
    Guide to Craft Bookbinding\". Craft in this context refers to hand made books
    using traditional hand tools as opposed to the use of machines as in contemporary
    mass production. When I was in college we were tutored in hand tools and traditional
    binding first before commercial binding.\r\nBoth books offer clear easy to follow
    instructions with excellent illustrations. All tools are easy to get or make yourself.
    Another good book if you can get it is \"Bookbinding as a Handcraft\" by Manly
    Banister (Stirling publishing NY). This book uses B/W photos which are not always
    clear, however it does have instructions and diagrams for making your own tools
    including a home made nipping press.\r\nThe bookbinders bible in my day was \"Bookbinding
    its background and technique\" by Edith Diehl in two volumes, but also available
    in a paper back single volume. But for those just starting I would suggest the
    Johnson books."

    kit in the late eighties / early nineties. Compact, versatile and inexpensive.
    Haven't seen anything comparable since then.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05602_5109.jpg]\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: ahh thanks, I purchased The Practical Guide to Craft Bookbinding. It may be
    more in depth than what i was searching for but I find it fascinating to learn
    about a craft for which I have no current knowledge!

    you mean small trim sizes, you might be interested in [[http://www.zoomalbum.net/what_is.php|ZoomAlbum.net]].\r\n\r\nAlso,
    although it takes away the fun and pride (or sorrow and shame) of doing your own
    binding, you might take a look at [[http://www.blurb.com/|Blurb.net]].\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

    impending move to Brooklyn, may well start discounting them -- they have almost
    everything else.\r\n\r\nI also recommend the first three books by Alisa Golden
    as good primers for beginning bookbinders: Graham beat me to the punch in suggesting
    The Bonefolder, although it does tend to be geared more towards \"serious\" bookbinding
    and book artists.\r\n\r\n(That being said, Peter actually published a picture
    of one of my books -- in Vol. 5, No. 1, which is the current issue -- and I don't
    think it's all that serious a book.)"
