    much longer&#41; in Viet Nam.  Here is a photo of me there in March of 1968. <BR>

  body: Jim, <BR> <BR>How do you read it the way you do? <BR> <BR>I know Neville Brody
    is cool stuff and all that, but I find this brutal. <BR> <BR>Peace and love has
    a picture of tranquilty and beauty for me. Warmth, softness, gentleness, human
    passions with dreams. <BR> <BR>This says to me crude and mechanical as a jack
    hammer, loud and disturbing. Reminds me of George Bush saying you are going to
    be democratic or we will torture you. <BR> <BR>As a life long pacifist I find
    it off-putting. <BR> <BR>

  body: Neville will have to speak for himself. I don&#39;t know what Brody&#39;s
    intensions were but to me I see it working as a contradiction done on purpose.  The
    stensil type so reminds me of the military and this is accross purpose with peace
    and love.  To me it says peace and love are empty words as long as they are stamped
    over by military might.  <BR>I don&#39;t think it trys to be warm and human.  I
    think it trys to be jarring and reminds us how words can be conscripted into service
    unwillingly. &#40;Spoken by someone who has been conscripted into service unwillingly&#41;.

  body: Nick, <BR>I enjoyed your article.  It reminded me of the low-tech 6os antiwar
    posters, hand painted messages with direct and often funny mixed metaphors.  My
    favorite was, &#34;Nixon, Pull Out Like Your Father Should Have.&#34;  It seems
    apparent that there was a correlation between feelings on the war and birth control,
    another hot topic of the time. <BR>ChrisL
