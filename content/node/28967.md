  used in the body of A Series of Unfortunate Events. Not the title or chapters font,
  just the body (regular) text portion. Thanks!

    - are you talking about a DVD or a book? Google tells me <em>A Series of Unfortunate
    Events</em> is a children's book series they made a movie from. Since you mention
    \"body text\", I assume you mean the book(s).\r\n\r\nLooks like an ID request
    for parents, booksellers or those particularly young at heart. :)"

    caslon </a> perhaps 540?\r\n\r\nI was difficult with my crappy amazon sample,
    you would be able to judge better with the book in front of you; I looked at the
    capital T, the lowercase g, the capital O and the lowercase t mainly.\r\n\r\nIt
    would make sense that it's caslon because it would match the titles which seem
    to be set in some version of antique caslon,\r\nsorry for vagueness but I hope
    this helps\r\n\r\n--N"
