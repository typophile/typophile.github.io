  subject I like. I was thinking to do something typography related, since I think
  my teacher wil like this, I'm personally interested, and I think it is an underestimated
  indicator of culture and technology. The paper needs to be very close to the level
  that is expected at university (footnotes with sources, detailed info, etc.), so
  I need to pick a topic that has enough available information, in books or on the
  web. I would like to know what you think of the topics underneath, regarding availability
  of info and interest. I have to have a focus question eventually, so if anything
  particular jumps into mind, feel free to share :-)\r\n\r\n- The transition from
  blackletter to humanist typography.\r\n- The connection between blackletter typography
  and germany.\r\n- The transition (at least partial) from serif to sans-serif.\r\n-
  Nazi typography\r\n- The differences betweem Italian, French, Dutch and English
  typography during the Renaissance.\r\n- Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nI'm not asking
  you to do my work. I'm merely interested to see if you find any topic particularly
  suitable for my project. I will also try to publish it on a typography blog, once
  it's finished.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\nJasper de Waard"

    speculative, and often plain crazy ideas about the choice of letterform might
    be an interesting subject, although I don't know if there are any proper sources.\r\n\r\nI
    think an interesting theme might be the social movement of modernism in the period
    between the wars, combined with the ideas behind the new typography (as proposed
    by Tschichold), Bauhaus ideals, Futura. This is also interesting as the Netherlands
    played quite an important part in this, with De Stijl amongst others. I think
    quite a lot of books are published around this theme."

  body: Thanks! I'll have a closer look at modernism, although it's a style I'm personally
    less interested in than, say, blackletter. Nazi typography sounds really interesting,
    especially since it might be related to the ever present love for blackletter
    typoraphy in germany, but, like you said, I doubt wether there's enough info on
    the topic. Perhaps, if I'm really lucky, Hitler wrote something about typography
    in 'Mein kampf', although it seems unlikely to me.

  body: "On \"blackletter\": this is a very generic name, which is easily misunderstood.
    There are many different forms, like Schwabacher, Rotunda, Textura. They have
    different origins, and historically also different uses. \r\n\r\nIt was used in
    Germany longer than anywhere else, but this predates Nazis or Hitler, though of
    course they also adopted it (being a conservative movement based on germanness).
    It has more to do with the wave of nationalism that originated in the 19th century.
    Only here the idea of Blackletter as related to german identity was developed.
    This culminated in the Nazi period of course, but it isn't something they invented.
    Hence the term Nazi-Typography is very simplified. \r\n\r\nThat Blackletter is
    now associated with Nazism, as well as hooliganism is to a certain extent true,
    but this does not mean that Blackletter = Nazi Type. Hitler probably said something
    on Blackletter (I believe the nazis switched to Antiqua at some time, as the idea
    came that the blackletter forms might come from the Hebrew letter... So even here
    the story is not so simple). \r\n\r\nIt might still be an interesting topic, but
    try to be subtle rather than sensational!"

    in aesthetics while the Nazi government was in power. Modern art and sans-serifs
    were branded un-German, while Hitler disliked blackletter because it didn't fit
    into his new age. \r\n\r\nHowever, sans-serifs were not accepted, but still used,
    especially in the earlier days of the Nazi party. Blackletters were also broadly
    used until they were called of Jewish origin and banned. Although less research
    into letterforms, this is an interesting research subject on the use of type in
    an early visual language. (Which the Nazi's mastered to the extreme by stealing
    iconic images)\r\n\r\nIt also requires less aesthetic knowledge, making the research
    more accessible for your school (I think at least)\r\n\r\nI believe in Christopher
    Burke's book about Paul Renner are some nice bits about these issues."

  body: "Thanks a lot Nick! Ever since I've joined typophile, I've enjoyed your ever
    so accurate typographic essays here. \"The transition from blackletter to roman
    type\" was the first on my list for a reason, and you just confirmed my gut feeling.
    You're completely right on the nazi/nationality thing. I found that it's much
    harder to come up with a clear (and answerable) focus question for those topics,
    so that only confirms what you said.\r\n\r\nEven though I instantly believe you
    when you say there's a lot of info on the incunabula, a quick google search does
    not really give me what I'm looking for. Let me try to explain:\r\n\r\nWhenever
    there's a change in typography, I expect a gradual (or sudden with clear cause)
    change in culture, technology, and/or ideology to be the cause (or effect) of
    that. Different tools, the getting to know of a new culture, or a mindshift like
    we saw in the renaissance, for example. These are the things that would make it
    an interesting topic, not just for me, but for non-typo historians as well. Most
    webpages simply show a picture of blackletter type, a picture of roman type, a
    discription of the differences, and the date people started using roman type,
    without suggesting possible causes/effects, an intermediate style (if there was
    one?), or more nuanced information on how this new typography spread. I expect
    to do some of the connecting between typographic info and general historic (culture,
    technology, etc.) info myself, but it would be really hard without some book,
    person or work to guide me.\r\n\r\nIn other words, do you know a source that describes
    the TRANSITION (sorry for that) of blackletter to roman typography in a broad
    way? If a source is simply your memory and historic insight, that would also be
    great! :-)\r\n\r\nMany thanks! jasper\r\n\r\nohh btw. I have to confirm with my

  body: "Jasper, here is my take on the emergence of the humanist type style:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    Italian humanist scholars of the Renaissance cherished the old manuscripts that
    preserved the classics of ancient Greece and Rome. The grace and legibility of
    the 9th century Carolingian miniscule hand were especially evident to them, appearing
    superior to the angular, condensed blackletter that had been, in various forms
    (quadratus, rotunda, b\xE2tarde), prevalent throughout Europe for several centuries.
    The scholar-scribes imitated the Carolingian lettera antica in their own writing,
    calling it the lettera umanistica. The humanist script of Poggio, developed in
    the early 1400s, was seminal, and a large part of the style that Nicolas Jenson
    immortalized in his definitive type of 1470. \r\n\r\n\u201CThe northern quadratus
    was the model for the first fifteen years of typography, in Mainz, but it did
    not survive the trip across the Alps. In Italy, types based on both the rotunda
    and umanistica were cut, the latter style prevailing under the name \u201CRoman\u201D.\r\nAlthough
    the blackletter had been employed by all Europe, not just in the Germanic north,
    it came to be known as Gothic because its use continued there long after the rest
    of Europe had adopted the Roman style.\u201D\r\n\r\nLook at the types of Sweynheym
    and Pannartz, the \u201CMontane\u201D romans, as these were the first attempts
    by the new-tech guys from Germany to make type for Italians, a transitional stepping-stone
    as it were, between Rotunda and Roman.\r\n\r\nCheck out the Ratdolt specimen to
    see examples of the Rotunda style of blackletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    should be a good start if you are looking for information about the transition
    from blackletter to serif type styles, especially in 16th century France. Hyphen
    Press released a new edition in 2002, and it is quite easy to get.\r\n\r\nSince
    your writing an academic paper, it would also be good to go back and look at what
    D.B. Updike had to say in <em>Printing Types</em>. While the book can be polemic
    in many places, it can still be seen as a \"foundational text\" about the history
    of of typography. So it should still be consulted, even if certain facts put forward
    in it have been refuted by later authors and their research.\r\n\r\nI'd put Stanley
    Morison's writing about blackletter into a similar category. Carter may even reference
    Morison in his book; I do not have a copy nearby at the moment. But Cambridge
    has published a two-volume set of most of Morison's writing, so it should not
    take long to glance through that and see where blackletter comes up. These books
    are probably available in several Dutch libraries, and you should be able to get
    them via interlibrary loan.\r\n\r\nOf course, you should also look at what Dutch
    writers have to say about the matter, too. Noordzij has written about Fraktur
    in English, in both <em>the Stroke</em> and <em>LetterLetter;</em> I'd assume
    he's written even more about the matter in the Dutch language. You should also
    look at the writings of Carter, Morison and Updike's Dutch contemporaries, which
    include Jan van Krimpen, among many others.\r\n\r\nGetting into a nearby research
    or University library that has all of the back issues of <em>Quarendo</em> should
    also be of a big help to you \u2013 http://www.brill.nl/quaerendo\r\n\r\nAs a
    Dutch pupil, I hope that you can use all of these resources for free, even if
    the Uni libraries might not let you check books out for use outside of their libraries.

    collection of the Erasmus. They have all writings from Carter, Updike and Morison
    as well (for Morison about blackletters you should check out his essay collection)\r\n\r\nIt
    isn't for free though and requires a membership, and many of the works are in
    the protected collection which of course can't be checked out. The membership
    fee however is extremely low for what is offered, you can pull some long nights
    there.\r\n\r\nStill, if you want to do research into type, a membership of the
    KB is mandatory, since they have copies of almost everything (and a lovely reproduction

    popularity, then Blackletter reconquered Europe due to it's economical width,
    then humanist ruled most of Europe for a reason I'm yet to find out. That's a
    transition, right?\r\n2. You get the point, and so does everybody else. They might
    have been scribes at some point, but they certainly became typography at some
    point as well. No needlesss discussions please.\r\n3. I haven't even started yet.\r\n4.
    So what questions should I be asking?"

  body: "<em>Is there such a thing as \u201Cthe transition from blackletter to humanist
    typography\u201D? The phrase pretends to be a question, but is in fact an unprooved
    claim. </em>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact.\r\n\r\nTypography in many countries
    began with blackletter, then changed to roman. Some did it early on in printing
    history (e.g. England), others later, most notably Germany. For instance, mass-market
    publications in Germany before WWII generally had fraktur (blackletter) body text.
    Now they have roman (humanist). Surely you\u2019re not disputing that? \r\n"

  body: "Perhaps what Andreas is trying to say is that the research question includes
    an assumption (the transition) rather than a hard fact. A better question might
    be: \"What was the influence of the cultural and technological changes upon typography
    from ... to ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA transition over such a huge timespan is a very
    vague notion. Why not try to be more specific, perhaps by narrowing your focus
    to a specific region (like Germany or northern Italy) or a narrower timeframe.
    To make a clean sweep across the whole typographic history seems to invite generalisation,
    whilst missing the interesting details. Perhaps in your early research you will
    find such a focus point which interests you in particular."

  body: "OK, let's not get in each other's hairs now... :) I was trying to clarify
    the point made before. There certainly has been a change, one thing has appeared,
    while another seems to have gradually fazed out. Speaking of transition, though,
    it lends an air of inevitability and co-ordination to it. To me, it seems it was
    rather more messy affair: in the same way we use Garamonds, Jensons, Caslons,
    Bodonis next to eachother, several styles coexisted rather than in sequence. \r\n\r\nI
    don't know, I just don't like generalising on broad historical movements, be it
    socialism or typestyles. But maybe it's just me..."

    (mostly Swedish) books, so may be of help to those wanting to trace the transition
    from blackletter to antikva. An intriguing aside: At least one book there has
    an u/c \xD6 and l/c o^e (o with e overhead), and on the same page, at that, IIRC."
