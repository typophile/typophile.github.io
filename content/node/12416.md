  more. if it wasnt for the price, i'd jump on Fontlab without hesitation, but that's
  a hefty sum to go throwing about any old day of the week...\r\n\r\ni've been exploring
  fontlab for the past few weeks, but like any good program, i feel i havent even
  scratched the surface of some of the more exciting features...e.g. opentype etc...\r\n\r\ni
  havent tried out typetool because i figure if you raise the bar on the learning
  curve you'll rise to the occasion...hmm..\r\n\r\nso if anyone has had experiences
  with both and prefer one or the other, i'd love to know all about it. i dont want
  to purchase something that in a few months i'll wish i hadnt, or wish i had just
  gone on to the more feature rich program. i havent been working on digitizing typefaces
  very long so my knowledge of what is important in a program is pretty minimal but
  i'd like to really become occupied with it. \r\n\r\nthanks all-\r\n*redesign is
  great!\r\n\r\nw|m\r\n\r\n"

  body: "well, i want to start by getting familiar with the program/s and get better
    at 'having an eye for it'. like being able to carry characteristics from one glyph
    to another to all. keeping that visual consistency. it seems really difficult
    right now...\r\n\r\nbut down the road i'd really like to create some usable and
    respectable text and display typefaces. right now it's more a hobby than anything,
    but since most of my logos i've done have used some sort of accompanying typeface
    with the mark, it got me really interested in adding to the sketches i already
    have for my own use and for any freelance that may pop up.\r\n\r\ni dont want
    to miss the boat on all of the features opentype has to offer which is why i'm
    leaning toward fontlab (even though i dont know a lick about how to use any of
    those features...) but as i've been playing around with the demo, i've figured
    out quite a bit and maybe it wont be such a hurdle to overcome...\r\n\r\nmaybe
    i just answered my own question too... :)\r\n\r\nw|m"

    limited transform features compared to FontLab, and for that matter, to Fontographer
    (transform featurs are, of course, not called that in FOG \u2014 and let's hope
    they never will be).\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "i think purchasing typetool for the $99.00 US dollars it is, isnt a bad route
    to follow. after all, the upgrade to fontlab makes up the difference if i had
    just purchased it in the first place...as long as files work from program to program
    (as i assume they would) it would be nice to start something on the less tech-heavy
    side and move into fontlab (hopefully 5.0 by that time) and give it the features
    fontlab has to offer.\r\n\r\nw|m"

    body: "Will,\r\n\r\nHave you heard that Fontographer is now being developed by
      FontLab Ltd? So, it has a new life.\r\n\r\nEven in its present state, Fontographer
      sounds like the right tool for the level of use you are describing. If you go
      by price then you will later regret not having the ability to add the keyboards,
      font families and cross-platform features which Fontographer has.\r\n\r\nThis
      kind of discussion is very personal and I'm just giving my opinion based on
      ten years of taking calls like yours. I fyou tell me more about what you expect
      to do I can help you narrow it down. The Fontographer forum archives contain
      good evidence that I am not just telling everyone to use Fontographer. \r\n\r\nIt's
      like buying a pair of gloves, you can post messages asking what kind of gloves
      are the best but only you can tell if you like them once you put them on and
      use them awhile.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJimmy G.\r\nDer FontMeister\r\nwww.supportandmore.com\r\nhttp://fontographer.blogspot.com/"
