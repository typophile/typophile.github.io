God, these jobs take up more and more Gigs, don't they???  All machines have Wacom Intuos Artpads (II or III, which I LOVE), wireless Logitech desktops (I'm using the di novo kit myself, very nice, although you should wait for the 2.0-version ;-), the 1.0 version has a very buggy bluetooth kit), and that's petty much it.

I found a switcher to be very space-efficient, but ultimately annoying since it affected key commmands and neutralized the on-keyboard volume and eject keys. When we switched to the Apple cinemas, I just got rid of it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, a keyboard tray is now an obligatory feature of my desk.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've gone back and forth on the two computer/two monitor senarios. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Long ago I had a Mac II with a large grayscale CRT and a small color CRT. Having two monitors was neat and people always went &quot;wow!&quot; when you moved something from one screen to the other. The real reason I did it was because it was less expensive than a large color CRT at the time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Later on I decided that one large color display was the way to go (the prices eventually came down). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A few years ago I got a Powerbook G4 and rediscovered dual monitors. I hooked it up to a 22&quot; Cinema display I had been using with a G4 Cube. I still wanted to use the Cube, so bought a cheap 17&quot; LCD for it and had three monitors (all flat) and two computers on my desk. That seemed to be too much, so I got a KVM switch and had both computers hooked up to the Cinema display. It worked pretty well, except that OS 9 (what I was using the Cube for) sometimes crashed when I used the KVM switch. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I have a dual 1.8ghz G5 tower hooked up to the old 22&quot; Cinema display and a new 20&quot; Cinema display. This works well, but I can never get the color temperature to match between them. I'm not sure which one has better color balance, but it just reminds me not to trust what I see on the screen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Powerbook is off to the side now doing email duty and goes on road trips with me. The cheap LCD is now hooked up to an HP Windows PC under the desk which I use for testing fonts and so on. So now I have four monitors on my desk. At least they are all flat. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For type design, LCD is much better than CRT mainly because the geometry is perfectly square. The inescapable geometry distortions of CRTs used to drive me crazy. Dual monitors is also handy for type design. All those windows and panes in FontLab take up a lot of screen real estate and a second monitor really helps.</div>
