body: "Hello everyone. I was wondering yesterday and came to a thought: is it more
  difficult, aiming to design a typeface family, to design a sans serif typeface from
  the serif version?\r\nI'm thinking that the sans is more rationalist and closest
  to the skeleton shape of the character, with less contrast of the strokes, and more
  affected by geometry. The serif design is more organic and implies modulation. Could
  I design the serif version just by \"chopping off\" the sans version?\r\nDon\xB4t
  take this literally, because I'm aware that are many ways of thinking about this
  and there are a lot of variables to think of, like the ideia of a humanist sans,
  but let's forget the gray areas and keep it simple. Does this make any sense?"
