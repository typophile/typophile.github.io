  body: "Searches of Dafont and T-26 (two of the best places to look for techno fonts,
    I think) did not turn up anything even close to this 'font'. I realize I was just
    playing the odds, and that there are many other places to look, but that should
    save anyone else the time who was going to look in those places.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: This feels like the work of Andreas Lindholm. The link to his Brainreactor
    fonts is now dead. He has a book, Metalheart, that features some of his fonts.
    And here are font names, but no samples. http://www.identifont.com/show?JO8

  body: "I think BJ has found it, because Brainreactor fonts are shown at Fonts.com,
    as part of Mindcandy Fonts, and the font [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=423865&|Futuremark]]
    looks like the font we were searching for.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
