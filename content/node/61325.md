body: "I am looking for some feedback on a companion font.\r\n\r\nI'm going to be
  designing a \"brochure\" of sorts for my company. It'll be somewhere in the area
  of 9\"x11\"--so more like a magazine format, but it will basically explain everything
  it is that my company does.\r\n\r\nWe're one of the leading builders in the nation
  of residential modular homes. These are really good quality homes. We offer just
  about every type of house you could imagine, from basic ones that are pretty cheap,
  to traditional homes with really nice interior styling, to urban-chic modern homes,
  and we can add the latest green features to any of these homes. Giving the customer
  anything they want means it's a little hard to position our style--but we do want
  to come across as smart and up-to-date. Our corporate font is Myriad--not anything
  I chose but I can't really change it.\r\n\r\nHere's a few things I'm also thinking
  about:\r\n1) At first, I thought of combining our corporate face, Myriad, with Diverda
  Serif for the long copy that will be in this brochure/magazine. But I'm also considering
  PMN Caecilia. I like how some of the characters in Diverda matched with those of
  Myriad, yet, at text size, the large X-height of Caecilia seemed more inviting.
  The latter was created 14 years earlier than the former. I want to use a text face
  that is modern and friendly, and geometric like Myriad. All these faces are based
  on Roman proportions. I admit 14 years, typographically speaking, isn't much difference.
  I thought the slab-serif was a nice touch for a company that builds modularly (each
  piece of a house is basically a slab, although we end up combining them in beautiful
  ways). I'm leaning towards Caecilia--but I wondered what others thought about their
  companionship.\r\n\r\nHere are type specimens: (sorry the PDFs were too large)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Large_4609.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Small_5188.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "REALLY TYPOPHILES?\r\n\r\n6 days and no answers?\r\n\r\nAll those people
    posting font pairing questions without even a semblance of what the job description
    is or how it will be used, all those times people ask \"what looks GOOD with what?\"
    \"What's the perfect font for that?\"\r\n\r\nSo here I present relevant information
    for my choices. And although I'm 90% sure Caecilia will be the right thing to
    do--a budding typographer could use some reassurance or critique on his methods
    & choices.\r\n\r\n"

    is that there never really is a \"right\" answer - just a range of possibilities.
    It's the nature of design problems. So enjoy the journey and pick something that
    will solve the problem at hand, knowing that there might be other solutions that
    could work just as well (and sometimes better) depending on the context...\r\n\r\nBut
    I think Caecilia will work just fine."

  body: "I couldn't agree more about there being no right solution. We're trained
    to have multiple solutions. Though, sometimes, some things seem more or less correct--in
    the subjective, personal sense where one says to oneself, \"Yes! THIS is perfect.
    This is the right one.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a case where on opposite days I think
    one is better than another. Then I revert my opinion. Repeat. At the very least,
    hopefully they could both work, and I've given the option that if Caecilia is
    rejected on grounds that it's a little quirky--I've got a backup in the other
    direction.\r\n\r\n"
