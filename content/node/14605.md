body: "Jogging home from my morning coffee, I came up with a rather evil idea that
  combines two of my obsessions: type (scientific research thereof) and puzzles.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku\">Sudoku</a> puzzles have swept the UK,
  and are just now gaining popularity in the states. In my experience, they're much
  like crosswords, but with much more emphasis on the logic and, of course, with no
  dependence on word knowledge. Among other things, my five year old son Max is starting
  get into them (he now does easy ones with me giving hints).\r\n\r\nBeing <em>good</em>
  at Sudoku means doing very intense visual decoding work - scanning rows, columns,
  and boxes for the presence or absence of symbols. Any mistake can well be deadly.
  Thus, the shapes must be highly distinguishable. There is already some theorizing
  on optimum choices for the symbols. According to the \"Solving Sudoku\" document
  at <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.org.uk/\">sudoku.org.uk</a>, <cite>\"Sudoku is not
  a mathematical or arithmetical puzzle. It works just as well if the  numbers are
  substituted with letters or some other symbols, but numbers work best.\"</cite>
  I suspect this may be because the brain tends to be well trained in picking out
  patterns in numbers.\r\n\r\nAlmost all published Sudoku puzzles I've seen use simple
  Helvetica digits. Is this optimum in any sense, or just convention? Would a choice
  of other fonts make any difference at all? How much of an edge do numbers have over
  letters or other symbol sets. Would the addition of color, shading, or texture help
  or distract?\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me that it may be possible to answer all these
  questions by crafting an online research study. The central component of this study
  would be a friendly website that offers interactive Sudoku puzzles, then collects
  statistics on the time to complete, probability of success, number of \"undo\"s,
  etc. When the puzzle is served, the number image set is chosen randomly from a pool,
  then recorded in the stats for subsequent correlation with the success stats. Further,
  cookies could keep track of multiple puzzles by the same player, which might yield
  insight into the process of learning.\r\n\r\nA very common problem in readability
  studies is poor aesthetic choices for fonts and setting. We could avoid that handily
  by soliciting contributions of number image sets from the extremely talented Typophile
  community. Creating an image set is a simple project, so I would expect a diverse
  range of creative and well-executed submissions. People with particular theories
  about readability (or legibility, or readerability, or whatever) would also have
  a chance to test out their ideas.\r\n\r\nMy gut feeling is that this project would
  fly. The Sudoku form solves a number of problems common to this type of research,
  not least of which is recruiting subjects. A well-executed website would have almost
  guaranteed popularity. I can also imagine that the raw data would be useful to other
  researchers, including cognitive scientists.\r\n\r\nOf course, being as busy as
  I am, there's no way I have time to set up such a project myself. I am intrigued
  enough, though, that I am open to collaborating with another person or two. I imagine
  I'd take responsibility for the more rocket-science aspects, including wiring up
  an open-source Sudoku generator, probably doing the Javascript for the interactive
  puzzle, and overseeing the statistics, doing my best to make sure that the experimental
  design is valid. What I'd expect a collaborator to do is primarily webmastery, doing
  the text and graphics for the site, promoting it in various forums, and coordinating
  the submission of image-sets. It would also be nice to have someone who was willing
  to help write up the results as a paper (very likely publishable).\r\n\r\nIdeas?
  Interest? Expressions of derision at the sheer craziness of the idea?"

  body: "I haven't tried Sudoku, so at first, the notion seems a little complex to
    me. My main interested would be if there is a demonstratable benefit in decoding
    or building Sudoku puzzles for students of design, and particularly, typography.\r\n\r\nA
    few of us are already exploring the possible uses of visual games and activities
    as potential tools for training/sensitizing young designers.  We hope to expand
    the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/16\">Typographic Edumacators</a> topic
    area with ideas, suggestions, experiments and proposals. Please feel free to expand
    on the topic of Sudoku.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, here is a link to <a href=\"http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/sugaku.html\">Sugaku
    Font Series</a> on Luc Devroye's site that might be of interest to you.\r\n\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

  body: The New York Post has two Sudoku puzzels each day, one easy and one hard.
    Its so popular they are making a contest with the puzzels. You could probably
    see the new puzzels at their site.

  body: The Minneapolis Star-Tribune just started running these, and I enjoy filling
    them out. I would think one type issue would be that the numbers must be easily
    copied by the puzzler, since the nature of the puzzle means that he or she is
    constantly scanning both printed and filled-in numbers together. That would be
    another factor besides readability/legibility that would come into play.

  body: "eliason: Yeah, that occurred to me too. So shouldn't it be Comic Sans rather
    than Helvetica? (or Arial, as the case may be)\r\n\r\nIn any case, matching written
    numbers should only be relevant for dead-trees versions. To work a puzzle online,
    the full spectrum of fonts, colors, etc., are available."
