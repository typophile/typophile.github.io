		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Sean! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The use is quite strange (especially in those SoBe Suzuki imagery), even if the graphic design is not so original and it seems they've chosen manson for the &quot;mythical&quot; feeling it may give (here paired with a somewhat cheap oriental feeeling). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems a quite &quot;superficial usage&quot; (like they often do with otherwise historical faces like Trajan) but it's interesting indeed.

		<div class="commentbody">Isaac, I'm really grateful. It's hard to nail down the samples I look for. Here in Italy we've had nice use of these faces but some of them I saw when I wasn't collecting samples yet. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Could you tell me more about this book? It's not so clear from the cover: the man seems a friendly blend between St. Joseph and Santa Claus but I guess it's just a good christmas story. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In case, could you send me a higher resolution scan in jpg? It seems enough interesting and unusual to fit in my project idea&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wonder why people feel always the urge to enlarge Democratica's initial letters when the face is meant to be unicase. Anyway, this comes most from amateurs, while in your sample the enlargement is moderate and works quite nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">this book is for grown-ups, although it's disguised as a children's book. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i don't know if you have board books in italy. in case it's a purely north american <!-- raw HTML omitted -->phenomenon, board book are printed on very thick, almost cardboard like paper. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it's like two sheets of 179 lb.

I did not imagine they have used Manson in other products beside the Barbie DVD (and I wasn't even sure they did outside Italy). Here Rapunzel translates as Raperonzolo, which is one of the most ridiculous names you can find in Italian. I guessed the original german name would have been something like that. After all it's from an old fairy tale. Barbie just plays the role of the Princess. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please do send the hi-res scan. The size you've used here it's just fine: make it 300ppi and it would be A-OK. In fact I mean to showcase the DVD cover in big size. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is because in it the &quot;dreamy&quot; and &quot;fairytalish&quot; atmosphere is so strong contrasting with Manson in an incredible way. The logo is also clean (without nifty digital effects like I see in your cereal box) but the cereal box is an excellent addition. I need it anyway! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now you can send it to my thought mailbox (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="mailto:thoughtNOCRAP@nettuno.it">thoughtNOCRAP@nettuno.it</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Leave out the NOCRAP string, which I put to avoid spam engines. Now I have a DSL connection at home (sort of, it's pretty crappy). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wish to thank Nathan for sending the Dinosaur scans. I repeat my request to him anyway, to have the two beautiful interior pages as they appear in the low res above, and not cropped like the ones he sent me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guys, you are really helping me! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks and love to you all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P.s. Nathan, you can use the thought address, too, for re-sending the two interior pages. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is no need to make them huge. Smaller files with a less lossy jpg compression would be better, in fact. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have you guys ever used proJPEG plug-in? It's *amazing* for the quality and compression. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to see if they've released a OsX version.</div>
