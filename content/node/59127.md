body: "My passion and respect for typography has thrown me into a big search for the
  \"right type\" since I am going to redesign a street-mag. Today they are using Blur
  as an \"identity-font\" and Warnock in the main text and headers. In my opinion
  warnock lacks a bit personality, and allthough it might be an easy-to-read font
  the fact that it requires 9 pt. to be acceptable in large portion of text makes
  it a non-ideal choice. For the Blur, I love alot of Nevilles Brody\xB4s work and
  can understand the intention for this choice (typish street-mag), i find it a bit
  clich\xE9. My aim is to make a cleaner look that appeals to the reader, and typefaces
  that are both a bit bold aswell as classical (no glossy magazine type or fancy/ultramodern
  stuff). Since the readers age streches from 15-80 years old the main type has to
  be an font that is easy to read. I could throw in some of my suggestion but am really
  eager to hear what other people might think based on personal taste and experience.
  In addition I would also love some examples of magazine etc. that you find works
  for you in style and type."

    I think it is almost the same clientele. \r\n\r\nFor me, this is a field where
    you should have as much fun as the the guys riding in the pictures your about
    to layout. Ok, maybe a little less...But if there's an audience that is willing
    and opened for novelty, this is it. Whatever new ideas I have, this is where I
    put them in practice. Where I can implement new paths without worrying so much.
    \r\n\r\nI'd totally forget about prior typefaces and aim a lot higher and crazier.\r\n\r\nYou
    can check out the last couple of issues [[http://issuu.com/vistaskateboardart/docs/vista_024_issuu

  body: "I think that you are on right track on wanting to do something cleaner and
    avoid the cliches of Blur-like low-fi fonts and handdrawn stuff. Actually I seem
    to have the impression that most skate and graffiti people I know prefer very
    well drawn, usually geometrical fonts to lowfi stuff.\r\n\r\nTo get a street feel
    I think it\xB4s the combination of things, you can get the rough edge through
    variety of means, not only typographical, so the type can have a lot of character
    \u2013\_or not. I\xB4d say that in magazines the papers and format are extremely
    important.\r\n\r\nIf you take Pin-Up (http://www.pinupmagazine.org), a magazine
    for architectural enterntainment, the layout is super clean in helvetica only
    but when you see the object, printed on very rough recycled paper, it has a great
    trash look. Also the use of color is great.\r\n\r\nThe Finnish Kasino A4 is on
    the same lines, a street credible look achieved by trash fotography and good choise
    of papers. The layout here also in Helvetica+Times. You can\xB4t really see the
    interiores here, though...\r\nhttp://www.wearekasino.com\r\n\r\nThe legendary
    BUTT, gay porn mag, also has some of the trash look even though it\xB4s typographically
    very controlled.\r\nhttp://www.buttmagazine.com/\r\n\r\nOr done well, using ugly
    type can avoid overdesign, like in the really interesting redesign of the 032c:\r\nhttp://www.032c.com/\r\n\r\nThese
    are really architectural & fashion references, but hey, what the hell, maybe it\xB4s
    good to mix the genres ;)"

  body: "Thank you so much for the responses, I will go in depth of all the magazines
    listed above.\r\n\r\nI can mention that the magazine is sold on the streets by
    people who experience hard times in their life, mainly drug addiction (and is
    also a source of income). The content revolve around society mainly reflects on
    the \"strugglers\"."

  body: "Juuni,\r\n\r\nI signed up just to respond to this. \r\n\r\nDid you attend
    the recent INSP event in Bergen? I work (volunteer) on a street paper here in
    Vancouver; our editor went to the event and it sounded great. I assume you are
    redesigning Megaphon as your profile says you are in Bergen.\r\n\r\nWe have a
    collection of street magazines from around the world. I don't have them all here,
    but it is quite a spread from very good to very poor typography and design. \r\n\r\nThe
    two I have in front of me now (that I think are good) are: =oslo, and sorgenfri.
    I have a couple other favorites, but don't have them on hand.\r\n\r\nYou should
    contact the INSP (International Network of Street Papers) and start your own collection
    of street papers, just to see what everybody is doing. I think it's important
    that we all leverage the international aspect of street papers, as it helps with
    design, strategy and even with establishing credibility with public (a surprising
    number of Vancouverites have poor opinions of street papers).\r\n\r\nSend me a
    personal email with your address and I can send you some issues of our magazine.
    It is also called Megaphone (megaphonemagazine.com).\r\n\r\nIt seems to me the
    european magazines have vastly better support and print budgets. We put ours out
    on newsprint and everyone is a volunteer. The volunteer part does make dedicating
    too much design time a problem, as we also have to pay our studio rent and scratch
    out a living. I would like to make every issue better than it is, but there simply
    isn't enough time. But I would love to be working with the quality of paper and
    sheet size used in the Bergen Megaphon (I have one right here).\r\n\r\nA street
    paper does not have to look grungy. It is an important vessel to carry news and
    stories that the mainstream media ignores or rarely focuses on. Many people, in
    the backwater that Vancouver can be, believe a street paper should be dirty and
    grungy and have spelling errors and so on. That's bullshit.\r\n\r\nHmm. I could
    go on.\r\n\r\nBut email and let me know about your work as I'm quite interested,
    and -- I repeat -- these publications can benefit hugely from international support,
    communication and collaboration.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTodd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
