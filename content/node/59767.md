body: "Can anybody please help? I have written 3 books for screen reading using  Geneva
  as my preferred font, originally on OS9, later in OSX but in Appleworks 6. That
  program allows Geneva as a screen font, and enables Bold / bold italic as options.
  \r\n\r\nNow I'm trying to export this as a DTP layout into Pages, and find that
  Bold Geneva does not exist in the OS, and that, somehow, these more modern programs
  refuse to 'fake' it. Am I missing something? Did Bold Geneva exist under OS9? (Of
  course my Intel Mini refuses anything to do with OS9.)\r\n\r\nHow then is it possible
  for Appleworks to fake it under OSX, but no other program? \r\n\r\nI know that I
  could reset the whole 90 chapters in Verdana etc., but I have always preferred 12
  pt. Geneva for simplicity of reading.\r\n\r\nI have failed to find any way of downloading
  a Bold (etc.) suitcase.\r\n\r\nHelp please.\r\n \r\nThanks GS\r\n\r\ngs@topartists.co.uk"

  body: "The reason Appleworks can fake it under OSX is because it's a Carbon app,
    based on the old Mac (pre-OS X) application programing interface (API). Carbon
    was a workaround devised by Apple to make sure there were lots of apps for OS
    X when it was first launched. Older programs could be updated to work with OS
    X by simply recompiling to Carbon, instead of starting over from scratch. \r\n\r\nPages
    is built with Cocoa, the \"native\" OS X API, which generally doesn't do fake
    type effects. You can tell when an app is Cocoa-based if it includes the system-wide
    \"Fonts\" window for choosing fonts, as in Pages."

    reset the lot in some other fonts and programs.\r\nI appreciate the help of you
    both.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, I wonder, can't OSX \"Pixel-shift\"?\r\n\r\nAnd what a waste
    of a good (but half-finished) font!\r\nIt would be well worth Apple, or some public-spirited
    soul, completing the set!\r\n\r\nAnyone out there?.....\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, is anyone
    else driven half-crazy by having to resize OSX Finder windows all the time, so
    that you can read the full contents of the last column top the right, and by having
    to open multiple windows to be able to drag items into the same folder? Despite
    the stability, I find myself constantly time-wasting in OSX. Bring back the ease
    of 9 ! \r\n\r\nGS"

  body: "You could get an effect similar to a pixel shift in Pages by using the shadow
    effect in the Font window. Set the angle to 0\xB0, drag the opacity to 100%, and
    the blur to 0. Then adjust the offset as needed. The resulting effect could be
    set up as a style, or you could redefine the \"Emphasis\" style using this psuedo-pixel-shift
    effect. It works okay if you save as PDF for viewing on-screen, but has a double-strike
    appearance if you print it on a laser printer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PagesScreenSnapz001_5519.png]"

    And by about a thousand other things Apple\u2019s horrible UI designers have done
    with the operating system. It\u2019s still better than Windows, but the people
    responsible for arbitrarily dumbing down Apple\u2019s software need to be run

    damage to Apple\u2019s netbook line that Jobs starts taking software design seriously
    again."

    sure what you mean. Moving files works essentially the same in the Finder of both
    OSes."

    Cocoa is certainly far far more work than adapting to Carbon, going to Carbon
    didn't simply involve recompiling (for the vast majority of non-trivial apps)."
