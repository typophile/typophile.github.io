  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello to every one, I would like to present Lisboa Typography because I want to get some feedback (critique).  The work is not completed but I have been working to finnished all sets until the summer. This is a part of the work but I think this versions are sufficient to show the idea between (regular, italic, small caps, dingbats). The first objective in this project was devolopment a humanist sans serif typography for text with a good performance on small sizes for use on a graphic composition for the magazine of portuguese teacher's from Portugal (APP-2000). In the same time I started with the dingbats version which the principal influence was the signs and the symbolic forms of the city of Lisbon. The forms of the letters are neo-humanist and this variation have a hooked head terminal. The contrast of the letters are medium and the stress between thick and thin strokes have left-angled. The forms are more condensed to give a economy of space as text font. So I aspect some opinions. <BR> <BR>Regards /Ricardo <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6734.jpg" alt="head"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it's no secret that I personally think we have enough humanist sans faces already - but at least this one is innovative in its lively lc. <BR> <BR>In the lc, I would say that the &quot;a&quot; is too wide (in both the Roman and Italic), and the &quot;k&quot; needs more life (in the Roman). I like the fact that the UC is more conservative - I think making it as lively as the lc would ruin all-UC setting. Speaking of which, I think your smallcaps need to be wider. A few secondary things: <BR>1) The ampersand's head is too big. <BR>2) Your stress isn't actually angled, exactly. It's more like <i>skewed</i> or something&hellip; Pretty original (although I've seen it elsewhere before, even in the work of certain prominent designers - but don't ask me to remember exactly who), it would be pretty important to see a text block in higher resolution. <BR>3) I actually think those &quot;hybrid&quot; numerals are very nice - even that wide zero. <BR>4) Those dingbats seem very Portugese! Cool. <BR> <BR>Spacing: I think overall it's good (just some specific problems, like the lc &quot;r&quot;), but the weight you're showing is too light for too much text - it will prevent the tight spacing necessary for good readability. Also: the Italic angles seem to waver. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice, Ricardo! I like it a lot. I agree in general with  <BR>Hrant's comments, and I would like to see a darker  <BR>version too. Also, like Eduardo said, the accents  <BR>are very important and you should put up a sample <BR>showing them. And the dingbats are excellent, deveras <BR>lisboetas! Quero mais. ;) <BR> <BR>Now, one thing that bugged me: why did you put f's  <BR>and f-ligatures in place of long-s's in these samples?! <BR>I liked the idea of using an archaic text in the samples, <BR>but does this 'magazine of Portuguese teachers' deal  <BR>regularly with medieval Portuguese? In this case you  <BR>should seriously think of designing a long-s and long-s  <BR>ligatures (the concept of a modern sans with archaic  <BR>characters is a bit perverse, but fun nonetheless). For  <BR>instance in the sample shown edited below all f's should <BR>be long-esses (not sure about the Cardinal's name): <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6769.gif" alt="s longo"> <BR> <BR>(and &quot;senhoriose&quot; should probably be &quot;senhorio de&quot;?) <BR> <BR>Mas isso</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank's for everybody for the comments. Sorry about my late feedback but let me organise the answers so: <BR> <BR>1-&quot;the only thing a can said at first sight is that i think you shouldn't be so shy with the ascenders and descenders in your lc numbers&quot;.  <BR>You have right about that the figures needs more difference (ascenders and descenders) and both versions (old style and lining figures). <BR> <BR>2-The tail of the middle f (regular, italic) are functional on small sizes. I didn't make a  printing test (Off-set) until now but on the laser prints they are function normally. <BR> <BR>3- &quot;a&quot; is too wide (in both the Roman and Italic). <BR>On my exemple I tryed to create on l/c &quot;a&quot; the same proportion of white space (counter) than &quot;n&quot;. But in fact I you are right I compared the l/c &quot;a&quot; with others charactes (b,d,n,p) and the forms must be more condensed. I started to make the corrections and this characters look's better now, the bitmap looks great. <BR> <BR>4- &quot;I like the fact that the UC is more conservative&quot;. <BR>Yes, is better the capitals stayed more conservative because the lowercase are a little bit more decorative for a normal sans serif. The hooked head terminal on capitals gives swash felling. <BR> <BR>5- I verifyed the space of l/c &quot;r&quot; (it's better) but I think that I must open more the finial this letter. <BR> <BR>6- &quot; italic &quot;f&quot; should have a subtler descending tail or no tail at all. imho the descenders are getting too close to each other in your f-ligatures&quot;.  <BR>I had been thinking if I joining the two spurs of the &quot;f&quot;, in fact this way fells strange. Inicially I gave the same countes space &quot;ff&quot; like the &quot;n&quot; for a reference but its better opean more the forms to brethe and compensate. <BR> <BR>7- The mediaval portuguese text that I used in fact was taked from a part of a cover book printed by Francisco Correia &quot;Rol dos livros que neste reyno se prohibem&quot;-1564. <BR>This kind of portuguese are to strange for me, the words have a spanish influnce I think, now in this days probably we write and speek like &quot;Lista dos livros que neste reino s</div>

This is because the structures of certain glyphs contribute to apparent rotation, especially in a sans (which doesn't have the stablizing effect of serifs). <BR> <BR>Of course, that low-res rendering isn't really a very good reference, so&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I prepare this file to show you and others this characters. Some people advice me that this abordage are not correct but I think this principal are honest with the all set. <BR>In fact I changed this letters because this actual forms are more simple and more simple to give space. The old version I had some difficults to combine some characters (space). I think that I stil have one of my firts draws and versions for this font, other more olders than this exemple, I will try to found to take the certainty if I real have this kind of version. I have a cemetery for this font because I have a lots glyph's archive that didn't funtion and they are taked from the recently version. I have been working on Lisboa and I had attention for all critiques, all most are valid to I continues this work to the right way.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Eduardo I inclued the long-s because I would like to give the possibility to this font to be able to work with this kind of letters and combinations. Normally we don't see sans serif with this stuff but it was Rodolfo that explain and corrected me better about this part of the work. In fact on this days we didn't use this kind of letters on portuguese language so they didn't have application on the present but I leave this attention to opean a bridge until to the past. I would like too read more ideas and thoughts from more people about this.  <BR> <BR>I will try to intergrate better this news letters (vwyx) about the forms and space but I think they are fine in this way. If I change the forms will broke with all the coherence betten that kind of terminal and the rest of the letters. In fact the curves terminations are align by x-height overshoot to make a visual compensation. <BR> <BR>&gt;&quot;I'd recommend is making the join of the ear to the bowl thinner&quot;. <BR>I made this correction to l/c &quot;g&quot; to take a better idea. When I transform (rotate) the l/c &quot;n&quot; to take the leg I reduce the thickness of the stroke but I try to mantain all most of of the forms to improve the same movemont and tention like the others letters with this <BR>hooked head serif. I inclued some different sizes to compare the hinting performance. <BR> <BR>Thank's and Regards &gt; Ricardo <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7043.jpg" alt="g2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Overall this face is very well done. However, after viewing the three weights together I'm left wondering how they would best combine together. For instance, the Regular weight appears too close in stroke weight to that of the Bold. Would they work together? Or would you use the Light and Bold? Of course you could make a Black weight to solve all of this.  This is an obvservation of a GIF so it's entirely possible I'm not getting the right feel. Again, very solid work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello every one and thank's for all the critics. About the differences betten the three weigths. I have the same thought like Hrant about the dark bolds. But my bold version is very smooth if you compare with other font with the same characteristics but it's visible the contrast if you compared with the regular version. I will have attention with this question, problably I will make some adjustements to check the result. About the sujection to create another weight (Black) are not in my plans for now, problably this ideia will be keep to the future if this work will be released. I made some pictures to show better the differents betten the Light, Regular and Bold. I will need comments to clarify better this situation. <BR> <BR>Plain you said -&quot;except the figures: more old style-like please&quot;. You are talking about the fact the descenders strokes of the old style figures have a little distance until to the baseline? One more time thank's to all for the comments and the ideias.  <BR> <BR>Ricardo <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11419.gif" alt="typophile-lisboa"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11420.gif" alt="texto"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11421.gif" alt="texto2"></div>

The toughest test would be on a low-res (600 dpi) laser printer, since that would make the various weights all darker = closer. <BR> <BR>Also: don't forget to consider FontLab's extrapolation feature. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

So about the released of this work I don't know yet the period or the date but I think will be finnish until the November or Dezember I hope. I had been some problems with my computer recently so I can't continue the corrections. David do you have any comments or critics to this work?

If so, I deeply apologize. <BR> <BR>I look forward to seeing more progress on this <BR>font as you can post it, and I also look forward <BR>to its release. <BR> <BR>The italics ar especially nice. I agree with Hrant <BR>and Rudolpho that the cursive-style lower-case <BR>letters work better, and keep the spirit of the <BR>rest of the italic set. Other than that, I haven't <BR>noticed any other spots that need any <BR>specific polishing. <BR> <BR>Again, congratulations on a fine piece of work! <BR> <BR>Best wishes, <BR> <BR>David</div>
