		<div class="commentbody">I used to have a number of books produced in England under the War Standards act. These are cheaply produced, and have flexible card covers: somewhere between a trade paperback and a hardcover book. Colour printing appears to have been limited also, since the books have very plain covers. Perhaps colour was reserved for specifically morale-boosting books. Interestingly, the cover typography of these books tends to be very plain and almost generic, as if the designers were keen to signal their commitment to wartime austerity measures even if it made no practical difference in the cost of production. War Standards book production in Britain continued for some time after the end of hostilities.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just finished Michael Black's <i>Short History of the Cambridge University Press</i>, and he says (at least I think it was there&mdash;I had to return the book to the library this morning!) that CUP used Times New Roman so much because it was quite economical in setting, and given the post-war paper shortage, that was quite welcome.  <BR> <BR>Dan, Tschichold went to Penguin in 1947, so strictly speaking, it was after the war that he drafted their design guidelines.</div>
