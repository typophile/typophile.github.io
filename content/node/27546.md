body: "Can anyone explain to me why it is that Garamond Bold seems to bulk up when
  it is converted to outlines? I am working with a logo that uses Garamond Bold and
  when I convert it to outlines it looks like it has a 0.5 px stroke. It really changes
  the feel of the logo.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for imparting your wisdom,\r\n\r\nDuncan

  body: This effect is due to the fact that hinting information embedded in the font
    is being lost when converted to outlines. The lower the output device's resolution
    is (screen!) the stronger the effect.

  body: "Whatever software you have is using different methods to render text and
    outlines; e.g. it's probably using hinting when it renders text, which obviously
    it cannot do for curves which may or may not be text.\r\n\r\nIf the logo's intended
    for print, then just ignore it: there won't be any visible difference on paper.
    \ If it's intended for computer use, then the solution will probably depend on
    the software you're using, but in similar situations I've found rendering the
    logo at a higher resolution than needed and then scaling it down in Photoshop
    often helps."

  body: "Ok. So just to clarify, if I convert the logo to outlines in Illustrator
    and it looks \"bloated\" on screen, then when I send it to print it should look
    the way it was intended -- not bloated, right?\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    trust you. It's just that I wasn't sure I was understanding correctly.\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much for the help.\r\n\r\nDuncan Robertson"
