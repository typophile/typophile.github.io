  body: "Thanks, Paul, as I read Coquette, I remembered that nice design, indeed,
    surprisingly close, I wonder if Mark knows about this metal cut.\r\nP.s. Tea and
    coffe at 3\xA2 of today's USD."

  body: Interesting. I don't think I've ever seen this face before. Definitely the
    same general idea at work as Coquette.

    the typefaces. Something else that resembles it (less so than Coquette) is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/canterbury-sans/|Canterbury
    Sans Swash]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    chance to identify a European typeface, and it was no help this time. Anyone out
    there have some good European type specimen books from the 1930's?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I have a few single specimens and magazines, but limited to Italy. This could
    be German or French.\r\nProbably there was an Augusta/Nebiolo \"clone\" of it,
    but I still lack an Augusta catalog covering Italian lead type from 1880 to 1930."

  body: "Too bad. We have this problem many times when the sample is a European metal
    type. \r\n\r\nThat made me think to try Georg's [[http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php|Bleisetzer
    site]] (Schriftensammlung part) and there it was, called [[http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=57&idart=608|Billet]].\r\n\r\nThanks
    to Georg, once again, for providing a wonderful metal type resource.\r\n\r\n -

    me identify some Nebiolo clones.\r\nAnd the [T] in the sample looks like an alternate."

    as are the proportions of c, t, k, m, n, u. g is awkward too. What I find pretty
    modern are the e and the first half of the \xE6, with the two-story a: starting
    from there you would get to a contemporary sans like <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html\">Bryant</a>
    with the swashy caps to boot."
