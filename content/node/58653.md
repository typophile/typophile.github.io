    they are used by publishers deemed \"too big\", who then require a license. This
    picks out particular publishers by name, rather than circulation or print run,
    and the list is longer than one might initially think, especially if you haven't
    bought comics since the early 1980s.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.blambot.com/license.shtml|Blambot

    Usage and Product for Sale\r\nThere is no additional charge for companies under
    $5 million (US Dollars) in annual gross revenue. If the logo has a specific application
    for a business within another company, then use the estimated gross revenue for
    that venture. For example a logo for a major motion picture would be priced on
    the movie gross, not the studio gross. \r\n\r\n$5 million to $10 million: $5000
    \r\n$10 million to $50 million: $10,000 \r\n$50 million and over: $15,000\" "
