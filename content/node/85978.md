  (marks),\r\nthe result is nice in adobe programs (illustrator for ex), but while
  testing it in notepad or wordpad the problem appeared\r\n\r\nwhen i add a mark to
  a letter it adds a  useless space, like the image below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_5048.PNG]\r\n\r\nthe

  body: Mark glyphs need to be zero width and assigned OpenType "mark" glyph class,
    how to do that depends on the tools you use.

  body: "It is not a problem. It is the Uniscribe text rendering as damma and kasra
    can not be placed simultaneously on a single letter, so the Uniscribe moves forward
    the second mark over the mark sign. Yes, you can apply a shadda with kasra to
    the same letter. {Uniscribe is the Microsoft Windows set of services for rendering
    Unicode-encoded text}\r\n\r\nAnyhow, you can get the required result in Adobe
    software.  \r\n\r\n"
