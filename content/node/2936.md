  I was writing for Graphic Exchange. <BR> <BR>That article is now finished: <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/Assets/Depts/Essays/NewPlast.pdf">New
  Plastic Weapons.</a> &#40;1.5mb pdf&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;The layout in the pdf here
  is pretty much a straight dump, and not that which the magazine art director came
  up with, which restricted the size of the type specimens.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'Nice article! Lingua rules. Two gripes: <BR>1&#41; Unibody&#39;s italic simply
    does not work for emphasis. Let&#39;s get over it - alltogethernow. <BR>2&#41;
    As much as I like Panoptica, I wouldn&#39;t have included it [if it was my design].
    Dude. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Nick - Excellent picks. Nice piece. <BR> <BR>Hrant - <BR>1&#41; Why? Sorry,
    I forgot. <BR>2&#41; I agree that maybe Nick shouldn&#39;t have included it, being  <BR>the
    author, but I do believe Panoptica fits the article and is  <BR>worthy of the
    title&#39;s label. Tough call.

  body: 'Maybe the question of etiquette in promotion should be raised in a thread
    of it&#39;s own.  <BR> <BR>In my view, Nick Shinn was totally in bounds in including
    one of his own fonts in this interesting article. It is relevant, above board,
    not overdone, and he is the author. It helps that the typeface is actually innovative
    and good! '

  body: I think it is perfectly legitimate for Nick to have included Panoptica in
    the way that he did. I&#39;ve seen much more egregious self-promotion by authors,
    often not only including their own work but waxing at length on just how good
    it is. Nick just describes Panoptica and explains what he tried to do with the
    typeface.

  body: Sorry to do this, Yves has me looking at text in editor mode.  <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve
    got a typo in the Perla section. In the copy you refer to the designer as Hughes
    not Hague. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s too late. <BR> <BR>BTW. Agreed, that inclusion
    of Panotopica is above board and appropriate in its novelty.  <BR> <BR>Randy
