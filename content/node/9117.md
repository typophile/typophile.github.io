  body: 'I like how he doesn&#39;t really answer the question he poses: are truly
    neutral typefaces possible? <BR> <BR>It also seeme a little weird to pass over
    Linotype faces like Basic Commercial and Neuzeit-Grotesk, which are arguably more
    characterless &#40;and therefore more neutral?&#41; than Helvetica or Univers.
    Basic Commercial has some funkiness going on with the line widths, but Neuzeit-S,
    at least, has very few unique characteristics at all, and doesn&#39;t have the
    curved-leg R I find so distracting in Helvetica. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also weird
    even to bring a geometric sans like Futura into a discussion of neutral typefaces.
    In fact, most of the humanist sans he mentions in the later part of the article
    are far too &#34;warm&#34; to be considered neutral at all. During <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/1243.html?1085757699">one
    of the previous go-rounds</a> in the never-ending &#34;Helvetica is the Devil&#34;
    wars on Typophile, Hrant suggested Kievit. I went and looked, and Kievit, too,
    is just too friendly to be useful in neutral contexts. <BR> <BR>I like some of
    Berry&#39;s columns and I realize it must be tough writing about typography for
    a more or less general audience, but this one seemed pretty muddled.'

    he poses: are truly neutral typefaces possible?</i>&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say
    it&#39;s possible to use a &#39;contextually neutral&#39; font, by which I mean
    a font that draws no attention to itself in a particular context &#40;cultural,
    temporal, setting, etc.&#41;. An example would be TNR on a business document.
    But even that&#39;s pretty hard. It&#39;s more like a fulfillment of visual expectations
    than any inherent feature of the face. <BR> <BR>So perhaps I mean that a font
    can be <i>used</i> neutrally, but the <i>font</i> isn&#39;t neutral.'
