  artist.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the title, I'm doing mine on Micehal Everson, but I
  haven't been able to find any sites other than his official page and the wikipedia
  article with information on him.\r\n\r\nI'd much appreciate any websites you guys
  can suggest to me, to find information about him."
