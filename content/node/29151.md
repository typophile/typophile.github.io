    it's called a 'character' not a logo. You said you're a student so you should
    get to know the proper terminology. I wouldn't call it pretentious either! It's
    a legal thing."

    symbol wouldn't apply next to a logo. You can add the \u2122 (opt.-2) trademark
    symbol, though.* However, you should only use the \xAE (opt.-r) registered-trademark
    symbol when your mark has been registered with the <a href=\"http://www.uspto.gov/\">U.S.
    Patent and Trademark Office</a> or its equivalent in your jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n<em>*
    in the U.S., anyway. Your milage may vary elsewhere in the world.</em>"

  body: Mike - I don't think she was talking about copyrighting a logo, just asking
    for the keystroke for the copyright symbol.
