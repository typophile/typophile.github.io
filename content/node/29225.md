body: "Interesting article in today's <i><a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006610310390\">Des
  Moines Register</a></i> about a small Iowa school district that must change its
  athletic logo to avoid a trademark dispute with the University of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nU.
  of Wisconsin's logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bilde_3795.jpg]\r\n\r\nWaukee
  High's logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bilde-1_6616.jpg]\r\n\r\nSnip
  from the article:\r\n\r\n<cite>There are only so many ways to reproduce the letter
  I. You have to be super-creative to come up with something unique. In fact, one
  might even say there is no such thing as a unique letter I. Almost every variation
  is merely a matter of typography. The same could be said about the letter W. That's
  why I hope Wisconsin didn't shell out the big bucks for this unique design.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Here's
  how unique it is. See that W to the left? Looks a lot like Wisconsin's, doesn't
  it? I created this original W on my laptop in eight seconds. It's one of the type
  fonts in Microsoft Word. The Wisconsin W is three buttons away. Click \"font\" then
  \"DispatchCond bold\" then \"control I\" for italics. There it is. So which came
  first? DispatchCond bold italics or the \"motion W\"? Is it possible to trademark
  a type style?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe need to educate the author in the art of logo design
  notwithstanding (only 8 seconds!!) and trademark and copyright law (sadly, type
  designs themselves are not protected by either, but their names are), I'm curious
  as to your thoughts? \r\n\r\nAnd, anybody up for doing some pro bono design work
  for Waukee so that their football team has something on their helmets next year?\r\n"
