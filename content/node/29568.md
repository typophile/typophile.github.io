  body: "Mate,\r\n\r\nunfortunately no ID here, but you can easily achieve the same
    result by doing some easy tweaking of Avant Garde in Illustrator (see below which
    took about a minute). But obviously if you need to set more text then just a logo
    that won't be an option. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/studio_6739.png]"

    nails it on the head.
