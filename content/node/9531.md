body: Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in the midst of creating a website and visuals
  for an open source app. So far I like the logo idea I have, but definately something
  seems lacking. Your comments would be much appreciated! <BR> <BR>Specifically I
  think the logo looks weak on reversed-out background, and not really sure about
  the fill-in coloring, but without the coloring it looks kind of boring ... <BR>
  <BR>Basically I want the logo to look strong and &#39;techy&#39; :p , strong as
  in strong dependable application. <BR> <BR>The project is called filepocket, its
  a web based file manager, the idea of it is so that someone can let other people
  upload stuff to a webserver without giving them full FTP access and with limited
  folder access too. The logo font is FivePX btw by Amoeba &#40;free from <a href="http://www.evolutionzone.com/hardwork/fonts/FivePX/"

  body: I think you missed a trick by not including the speed lines in your final
    drawing to make it look more uploading than parachuting. In the small versions
    the spinning blades look more like a umbrella, so I would reappraise the blades
    maybe going back to the beanie hat sketch with a blur &#40;if it looks too static&#41;
    and apply perspective to the document icon to make it sit better with the perspective
    of the blades. <BR>Tim

  body: Instead of a solid line for the propeller movement, taper the two lines out
    to indicate movement. <BR> <BR>Also, I agree with Tim, the speed lines on the
    bottom would be a nice addition to the final logo.

  body: I guess that the righthand version would work best at the size you intend,
    I would like to see it on the colour background maybe with reversed out blades
    and speed lines, you might find that the speed lines have to be longer and of
    different weights, heavier and longer to the centre. It is an attractive icon.  <BR>Tim

  body: Hmm...I like the blades a lot better now...but now the doc seems a bit too
    rigid. <BR> <BR>What if you gave the document a bit of perspective? Have it narrow
    toward the bottom to put it in a plane perpendicular to the blades? That would
    also give it a bit more movement as it would appear to be uploading &#39;up and
    towards&#39; you.

  body: you have a nice fluid propeller, but a stiff, static document. there&#39;s
    a bit of tention there. Try adding a bit of fluidity to the document part of the
    illustration.

  body: The perspective version works best for me I think the lefthand speed line
    needs to go slightly to the right. A problem with making a looser document image,
    it might reduce the &#34;conventional&#34; document icon that many would recognise.
    The colours of the version on your website look good although the shadow of the
    blades might be better if less strong than that of the document. I won&#39;t pretend
    I fully understand the product but good luck with it. <BR>Tim

  body: Thanks Tim, <BR> <BR>Its very exciting for me that people are actually looking
    at the site haha, yippie!! ... yippieee!!! <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll explain a little
    on what the app is suppose to do ... &#40;geek alert!!&#41; <BR> <BR>The main
    objective of this app is provide a visual interface to a remote web server. For
    example, lets say someone has a website with space and bandwidth to spare, this
    app lets the owner utilize that space by providing a front end website that can
    access that free space for purpose of storing and passing around files, the thing
    that is a little different from other such apps is that this lets the owner create
    user accounts for other people, so they can use his free space too! haha! ...
    I think if eventually I get one download a year, I will be a pretty happpy guy
