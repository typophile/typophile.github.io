  body: "I think that it's certainly within the scope of the OpenType fonts to provide
    a number of alternates. MADType's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/casino-hand/casino-hand/characters.html|Casino
    Hand]] is one such font, although it is not the same as the posted sample. Another
    is Alejandro Paul's [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000316#characters|Pronto]].
    However, neither of these two fonts IS the font in question. I think it is a font
    because I see no more than two variations of any letters, which is certainly do-able
    in OpenType.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
