    the look of a freefont perhaps. Did you check the Techno category at Dafont?\r\n\r\n-

    dafont :: Techno - Various\r\n - dafont :: Techno - Sci-Fi\r\n - dafont :: Sans-Serif\r\n
    - myfonts :: search \"rounded sans-serif\" (That's where I discovered 'Reflex'
    in addition to the one Mike posted)\r\n\r\nI'll take a spin around some additional
    foundries today to see if we can pin it down."

    now of the opinion that this is more likely a customized wordwark. Mike's ID of
    Leger is an excellent candidate for what might have been used as inspiration.
    Do you have a source of where this came from? A Google image search produces nothing."

  body: "Hi Creative no I don't have any more info, I was provided with an illustrator
    file which contained a logo and there was no type references and the type converted
    to paths.\r\n\r\nThe logo contained 2 words each using a different font and I'm
    in the same situation trying to find the font of the other, I have a thread for
    the too.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/63535\r\nhttp://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/74/743d217333c07ad80024cc371a3e7a56.577598.jpeg\r\n\r\nIt
    could be that both are just custom and have used these other fonts for inspiration,
    must have been a fair bit of work put into them to go that way?\r\n\r\nI've never
    done too much font customisation coming from a web design background, when developing
    a logo/identity as the designer do you just say to the client there is the option
    of customised font work to help create a unique identity, if the designer thinks
    it would be appropriate? I'd presume you'd have to charge extra for the time etc.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help"
