  would bother to even look <a href=\"http://lasquetipress.blogspot.com\">here</a>
  is beyond me.\r\n\r\nIf you really care what I think about (and why would you, unless
  you think I have something useful to say), you'd subscribe to my RSS feed, and I
  wouldn't have to bother wasting my time updating this <b>severely</b> lame blog.\r\n\r\nToo
  bad there is no IM here (yes, I know, Zara says it's \"lame\") but I'm not making
  out a cheque to Typophile without it."

    is no IM feature on Typophile.
