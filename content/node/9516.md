body: Lately, we have been having alot of spinning-ball time-outs and corrupted files
  while using InD.  This has happened on 3 different OS-X Panther Mac G-4s.  Another
  problem has been with files that started out as Quark files and were opened in InD.  Sometimes
  the position of frames on screen is off by about a pica in 2 directions--as if it
  were in drop-shadow position. <BR>Any help would be appreciated. <BR>ChrisL
