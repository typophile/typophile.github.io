body: A friend of mine designed this and I LOVE the font. However, I can't ask her
  what it is because she moved overseas literally three days ago. Dying to know though.
  It looks like Didot, but the contrast is higher. Wondering if she altered it or
  if it's an existing font. Any ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/622811_440543492660150_1415455099_o_5414.jpg]
