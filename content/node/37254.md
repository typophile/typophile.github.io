  (Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual) Society. It will be aimed at potential members and used
  on a banner, in business cards, leaflets, posters and on our website. It needs to
  give a young, relaxed, friendly, modern and not stereotypical impression and yet
  still try and get across who we are.\r\n\r\nAttached is the logo we currently have
  and I'm a bit unsure about it - mainly because the font I have tried there really
  doesn't fit. I'm not too sure about the logo as a whole but would really appreciate
  any suggestions at all and any suggestions for a more suitable font.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\nRich\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3935.png]"

  body: "well, the rainbow says \"gay\". The logo as a whole has a undefined german
    eco-feel to it \u2013 \"Bundes\xF6koverein Nat\xFCrlich Gaia\" or something like
    that. How about black instead of dark purple? Also, is it possible ti change the
    sizes of the two parts of the name? Now it doesn't look like a name to me, more
    like an abbreviation. If you get my point.\r\n\r\nWhat did you want to achieve
    with this typeface? Bauhaus is quite dated.\r\n.........................................................\r\n<a

  body: "The logo was produced by someone last year so I'm just trying to update it/improve
    on it in any way I can really. The rest of the committee seem to want to keep
    it so I'm a little constrained to just modifying this logo. Not sure if that is
    a good or bad thing really..\r\n\r\nI would like to to say gay but hopefully break
    away from the rainbow and stereotype attached - making it more \"I'm a student
    who happens to be gay\". I will have a try with black, the purple was chosen as
    its the university colour so probably relates it to the uni a bit. Yep I can change
    the font size - I'm not sure what you're suggesting exactly though :(\r\n\r\nThe
    font that is there was purely the one that I had there at the time - as you say
    its a bit dated and I don't think it fits really. So something that firstly fits
    in with the style of the logo would be a start. I wanted to go for something young,
    relaxed, \"fun\"/student. I really liked the channel4 branding here http://www.fontsmith.com/custom.php?id=488\r\n\r\nRich"

  body: "Overall I think it feels rather dated and also a bit childish, with the bright
    rainbow colors and the bold lines. First I would try to find a sharper and contemporary
    font, probably sans serif but not too bold and not too rounded. It's probably
    good too use the rainbow, but I would make it less frivolous, and the lines more
    straight. It would indeed also be better to use black instead of the purple that
    is now dominant. Maybe it seems ironic but I would go for a slightly less 'gay'
    look overall... you don't want to overstereotype, and I guess people could be
    put off if it's too over the top.\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"
