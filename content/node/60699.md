  website for reference purposes... Included will be a portfolio with some of my recent
  work and contact info... No big deal really... I also developed some sort of own
  identity (consisting of a logo) which will be a cornerstone of the site...\r\n\r\nCould
  you tell me what you think about my logo? (jr are the initials of my first name)\r\n\r\nCheers

    glance, i'ld say you're a DJ. If you are, you're almost there, some adjustment
    are needed but it's pretty good. If not, you may  need to redefine what you want
    people to learn about you when they see you logo. You want your logo to represent
    you and what you do."

  body: "Quite nice as is.\r\n\r\nFrom purely geometrical perspective - have you tried
    rotating the logo CCW a bit more so that j's descender (where it exits the circle)
    was pointing precisely down and then moving a drip <em>there</em> (and removing
    the second drip) ? I think it may look interesting.\r\n\r\nOh, and I would get
    rid of the : in that case."

  body: "hey guys,\r\n\r\nthanks a lot for your input... Well, I just recently finished
    my studies in graphic-/visual design and I am trying to figure out a good way
    of presenting myself and my portfolio. I don't know if the logo really delivers
    that message, but it could be interpreted as some stencil where to much paint
    had been applied or even a paint bomb. What I am trying to deliver is, that I
    like the rough approach and also like to mix traditional and modern ways of designing
    (by what I mean, that I am not the kind of person who creates everything on his
    Mac, when the real deal is already out there and one just has to scan it in -
    a piece of fabric for example...).\r\n\r\nepsilicon: I've played around with the
    drips quite a bit already -- flipping them, changing their sizes and so on...
    -- However, I like your idea of \"making the font drip and will give it a try.
    I added the : to leave things I do up for discussion... It could also be interpreted
    as an introduction to a presentation. So when the logo is added to a photo of
    mine for example, it reads as if it's presenting the piece. Do you think it's
    confusing? Is it too bumpy, is there too much going on?"

    just smooth those edges at the bottom a little so it's less distracting.

  body: "At first glance the drips looked like legs on a round character that's leaning
    backwards. I don't get a paint ball from that, way too round and perfect. I think
    stencli might also be bit of a strech, again way to perfect.\r\n\r\nDoing some
    real stencil work with your mark as Frambwaze suggested is a good idea. I think
    you should do that after you're done with the type, shape and placement. That
    would add some originality to it, try to use to much paint, too little, do it
    sloppy and see what kind of variations you get. Would be cool if you could see
    some part a little smudged or blurry with to little paint or something like that.
    Also maybe doing something with the circle so you would get more of a variation
    when you do the stencil.\r\n\r\nI also reacted with a little head tilt when I
    tried to read it. The tilt dosent feel right, I'd play around with that some more.
    The type I like I don't think you need to do much about that if you don't want
    to.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that would help getting across the message of a graphic
    designer is colour. I'd start to add and play around with colours after the stencil
    work, maybe use three or four colours.\r\n\r\nYeah.. I'd say go for the stencil."

    that might give some interesting results.

  body: "Hey guys...\r\n\r\nok, sorry \u2013 I was way too busy during the last week
    so I didn't get a chance to respond. Anyway \u2013 first off: thanks so much for
    your feedback, I really appreciate it... When you're at the beginning of your
    design career, just out of university, it's great to get advise from professionals.
    I think you know that \u2013 just right after uni you feel uncertain and always
    question your decisions, if the design-decisions you took was right.\r\n\r\nI
    share your objectives \u2013 like the one with the (lets call him 'obese' ;-)
    ) man. I realized that after looking for some time at my logo and playing around
    with it, I thought it was only me but obviously it's not. So this needs some tweaking
    for sure. I feel it might be the drips looking like legs, I'll work on that. I
    quite like the idea with the arms though ;-)\r\n\r\nAlso you're right with the
    shape \u2013 that it's probably way to 'perfect' to be a paint-bomb or stencil.
    I'm going to print it out and make a real stencil out of it... and do some stuff
    with it during night *hehe* ;-) . \r\n\r\nRegarding the colours: well, I quite
    liked it's black simplicity. It looks rougher like taht I guess. However I will
    also give that a try...\r\n\r\nI am going to keep the :\r\n\r\nI am also going
    to play around with the tilt, I also think of it as a bit too extreme now...\r\n"

  body: "ok, I reworked the drips and also tried to combine it with the type... I
    also enlarged the type and reduced the tracking. The extreme tilt is no more.
    It's funny that when you stare at your work for too long, you don't recognize
    certain things no more. Like the tilt \u2014 I felt it was ok but when you guys
    mentioned it, I thought 'wait a minute... it is a little extreme' :-)\r\n\r\ntomorrow
    I'm gonna cut it out and do some stencils on wallpaper... still I feel the logo
    needs a little more tweaking so what do you think?  :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5699.gif]"

  body: Only thing striking me that it's a little 'bottom-heavy, meaning the type
    is maybe a tad too small in the dot...Also the dot on the j anfd the top dot of
    the punctuation mark don't weem to align. Looks pretty solid already though.

  body: "My only objection is that the drips don't look \u201Cdrippy\u201D enough.
    They look like wax drips that dried and hardened on the side of a candle. I think
    it might help if they came straight down from the circle shape instead of starting
    their curves right at the circle-drip junction."

  body: "Hey guys...\r\n\r\nI normally don't do this \u2013 coloring the logo before
    it's final. However, I had a little spare time on my hands, so I started fooling
    around with the logo a little bit. If you think it's horrible please tell me :-)
    The drips are getting worked on and I'll make a stencil over the weekend and post
    the results as well... Also, I'll check the type and reset it....\r\n\r\ncheers....\r\n\r\np.s.:
    I am aware that the stenciled draft might cause trouble with low resolution printers
    or when I set it in B&W (or somebody photocopies a document with this logo on)...
    That's why I though, it wouldn't be a bad idea if I vary the use of the logo by
    keeping it's main visual aspects \u2013 the insides aka. the circle with drips
    and the type \u2013 and diversifying the rest depending on use, occasion or medium.
    Like the stenciled logo might work on the www, the transparent-slide/screenprint
    one on slides and the b&w one on the web, paper and keynote presentations.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_coloured_5047.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

    and trendy which, even if it is what you are after, may be seen by potential clients
    as the extent of your design abilities. The same is true about the grafiti links
    of the stencil; some, myself included, love the graphic aspect of grafiti, but
    some will have a very negative association.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "the latest version looks very nice. But I would smudge it a lot more because
    when you scale this down it's going to look clean and sharp. The sprayed bit looks
    ok scaled down but the type becomes very neat and dosen't have the same feel anymore.\r\n\r\nYou
    could try swiping your hand over it just after spraying. Or add too much color
    and tilt the paper right afterwards. Or use a straw to blow through just after
    spraying."
