  to redo it because it turns out I was mistaken about having permission to use the
  background.  Unfortunately I can't remember what font I used for my name (\"Michelle\").
  \ I know I got it from some free font site, or else it was already installed on
  my computer.  (I am using a new computer now, of course.  Sigh.)  It can't be too
  uncommon a font since I am usually too lazy to look very long for a font I like.\r\n\r\nOh,
  the drop shadow is not part of the font; I added that.  I really appreciate any
  help you can give me!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cm_aisling_5987.png]"
