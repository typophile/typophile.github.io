  body: I don&#39;t know what this face is &#40;if it is a typeface&#41;, but the
    letterforms are inspired by Bauhaus faces like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bauhaus/demi/testdrive.html?s=top%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bpops&amp;p=80">ITC
    Bauhaus</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pump-2/pump-medium/testdrive.html?s=top%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bpops&amp;p=80">Pump</a>,
    so those might provide a starting point if you have to reconstitute the logo....
    Pre-digital versions of these faces had alternate &#34;e&#34; characters like
    the one in the sample, but I doubt if you can find these in the digital versions.
