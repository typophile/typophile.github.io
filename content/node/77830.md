  thought it might be useful to share it with everyone here too. What do you guys
  think?</em>\r\n\r\n<code></code>\r\n\r\nI noticed that I still keep using \"My Account/Track\"
  to check for any activity on threads that I have participated in, and this takes
  two clicks (\"My Account\" on the sidebar, \"Track\" on the Profile page). This
  is one click too many :)\r\n\r\n** Please do consider automatically adding threads
  I create or reply to to My marks **\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to assume that people
  would want to \"mark\" all of their own threads. Currently it is easy to forget
  and it is unnecessarily manual. Automating this is a natural extension of \"My marks\"
  and it should make it much more useful to a larger number of (lazy) users like myself.\r\n\r\nAlso
  - and this would extra uber cool and save yet another click - show how many items
  on the Marks list have a \"new\" tag. Something like this:\r\n<em>\r\n  My account\r\n
  \ * My blog\r\n  * My marks (10)\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nLastly, perhaps consider renaming
  \"my marks\" to \"my watchlist\". \"Marks\" is kind of confusing, esp. to the newer
  members just starting out with TP; and \"watchlist\" reflects the purpose of the
  feature better.\r\n"
