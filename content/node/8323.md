    mention: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Tintoretto is an old typeface, the only digital version
    I&#39;m aware of is that of <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/t/tintoretto.htm"

    The &#39;A&#39; in the Solotype Catalog is similar, but that&#39;s the only character
    in common with KASCH shown. <BR><br>'

  body: Thanks a bunch Ignacio. Interesting. Murilllo&#39;s &#39;A&#39; in the Solotype
    Catalog is exactly like Tintoretto&#39;s, but the one in Dan Solo&#39;s font is
    quite different. Between the two, there seem to be the basic letterforms of that
    KASCH logo though, eh?

  body: 1. Thanks allot Mike! The logo has been the same for many many many years
    so natururally it had to be an old typeface.  <BR> <BR>2. The font is almost perfect,
    except the letter &#34;H&#34;  Is it possible it could be a different type? Also,
    is there a typeface that would match that H?

  body: Sorry, didn&#39;t check the whole character set, you have that &#34;A&#34;
    as the only alternate. <BR>The &#34;H&#34; could have been easily modified...

  body: Thats what I thought too Ignacio, im gonna have to modify the H. Also, I&#39;ve
    been looking on yahoo and such for the Murillo type but I&#39;m having no luck.
    Is it only available on that CD? If so, where can i find it?
