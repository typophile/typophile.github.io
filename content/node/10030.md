  body: Most probably a <a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query_id=1476339&amp;page=38&amp;brand_id=19454"
    target="_blank">logotype,</a> not a font, especially looking at the T. But Futura
    Extra Bold is on the right track.

  body: There are a lot of sans faces that are very close to this look. Even <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-95-black/testdrive.html?s=U+N+I+T+E+D&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank">Helvetica</a> looks close. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Based on your new post, I&#39;d say it&#39;s Helvetica, but customised &#40;the
    T and R stand out the most&#41;. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: The United logo is a modified version of Futura Bold. When  <BR>United spun
    off Ted, they kept Futura Bold, but used U&amp;lc. <BR> <BR>&#40;TedEx anyone?&#41;

  body: Upon a second look, that e in Ted is not Futura. Or if it is,  <BR>Pentagram
    modified that too.

  body: Ted looks more like Akzidenz Grotesk than Futura to me, the angle at which
    the lowercase &#39;e&#39; ends kinda gives it away.
