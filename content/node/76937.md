body: "I need someone to design and do the layout for my album sleeve. My artist name
  is Slow Medicine and the artwork is as per my photo on this site.\r\n\r\nAs you'll
  see,the front cover still needs some work. But as the design is for a wallet format
  for a CD, there are three more pages to lay out (we have additional art work). So
  there's a tracklisting on the back page, a page of info on the inside left, and
  then the third page is where the CD itself is housed. \r\n\r\nOh and I have a -
  very small - budget. \r\n\r\nAnyone interested? Email me on toby.manning@blueyonder.co.uk\r\n\r\nBTW:
  the music is art rock (I can send anyone who's interested some examples). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
