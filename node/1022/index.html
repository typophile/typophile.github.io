First we must understand the meaning of this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mike Parkers words. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;.. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The idea was to replace linotype operators with faster tape drives. In order to justify lines predictably, each character had to have a predictable width. Fairchild established a standard width for each character expressed in a single fixed set of eighteen units to the set width em to be used for all typefaces regardless of typeface design. The wider the column width, the larger the eighteen unit set width required.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;.. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I read this to mean: Unlike Monotype where the units were based on the em of the type, The units in Linotype were simple a fixed formulae giving truth to predictability of column width regardless of type design. In otherwords the column width is more important than the type width. In any event, it appears to be quite cumbersome. And I predict your solution would not be quite that simple. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps I am wrong!

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Do you mind if I insert (AND UNITIZING) and see if it meets with your approval.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, I do not agree, in this instance. I think you are misinterpreting Mike's reference to TTS. The development of TTS machines led to the introduction of unitizing systems within the Linotype line, but these units were not subsequently applied to all projects. TTS was used only (or at least predominantly) in the transmission and setting of newspaper copy. TTS units would only have been used on faces intended for newspaper composition. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is my understanding, but you might double-check with Mike. I don't have his new number since he moved. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, news faces were the large bulk of Linotype's bread and butter in the late 1950s and 1960s, as newspaper comp was the last bastion of Lino's market. (Mike has said that Jackson Burke lamented that most of his tenure at the head of the MLCo. type department was spent forever revising faces for ever-narrowing newspaper columns.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it was not the entirety of Lino's type output. Sabon would have been targeted toward the book composition market, and those houses would not have had TTS machines nor any need to conform to TTS standards. So I do not think it is reasonable to assume that Sabon needed to be designed to any unitized system on account of Linotype composition.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sabon would have been developed while Mike was at the helm of the American MLCo. type dept., I believe. The face was cut by Stempel (who were essentially German Linotype), but Mike might have some direct recollections. You could ask him. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant &ndash;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do not know which size this digital Sabon (Adobe's BTW) would have been based upon. I would presume the 12 point, based on what I know of the general transition of designs from metal to photo to digital. But I can only assume.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may be right and the decision about which unit width to assign the 'a' to could have varied by size &ndash; wider for the smaller sizes, narrower for display. On the other hand, I doubt that Tschichold would have made a different decision. Just a practical matter. Text would have been set primarily by machine comp; display would usually have been set by hand, I imagine. So all of the Lino and Mono sizes would probably all have the same wide 'a'. I suppose that the foundry display sizes could have been cut without these restrictions, but I don't know. I don't have information about what sizes were released in each medium. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clearly, you would have made a different decision under the same circumstances &ndash; sacrificing the italic 'a'. Tschichold made the other decision.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obviously, Sabon was ripe for revision in digital without all the constraints, as aptly demonstrated by Jean-Fran</div>

When it comes to the Monotype &quot;width snapping&quot; limitation, Sabon is not a special case qualitatively, just quantitatively: the &quot;a&quot; would still have been too wide (just less), or maybe too narrow, even if JT didn't have to factor in the Linotype's limitation (duplexing) as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My other line of thought was just an attempt at analyzing JT's design decisions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

As I understand it, the TeleTypesetting System was an independent technology for transmitting wire stories to newspapers. Those publishers who subscribed to the service would receive stories via wire, which came out as punched tape. These tapes were then fed into the composing machine and produced typeset stories for the newspaper to publish. The device that interpreted the punched tape would be fitted to any of the various composing systems. Linotype was only one (arguably the most common).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The point of the unitized standard for typefaces used with the TTS was that the stories would always run to the exact same characters per line and, consequently, an exact column length regardless of the layout of the paper &ndash; specifically, regardless of the column width of the newspaper's grid.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thus, a wire service could wait until the last possible hour to file a late-breaking story by indicating in advance that they would have the story run to X column inches and the papers could then continue to lay out their editions by holding open X inches of space for that story. This kind of just-in-time publishing depended upon reliable, consistent character counts, and column lengths. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It had nothing to do with justification <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Linotype machine required no unit-system in order to achieve effortless justification.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;But maybe some smart investigation (like seeing what fonts were used in those pages) could narrow it down a lot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, obviously, the fonts used were self-spacing types. ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's some research along different lines: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linn Boyd Benton took out his patent for a system of self-spacing type in 1883. The United States Type-Founders' Association defined the American point system of type sizes in 1886. Notice that this article still cross-references the old, named body sizes.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Updike (Vol. I pg. 34) mentions that &quot;In 1894 a western firm introduced this system of self-spacing types, every type in their entire output being placed on a body the width of which was equal to an even division of the standard 'pica em.'&quot; This term 'pica em' was apparently soon replaced by the term 'point-set'. Note that your article still refers to divisions of the Pica em. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Given this, I am going to assert that this article dates from between 1886 and around 1896, somewhere thereabouts.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first typeface issued by (American) Lanston Monotype was in 1896 and it was for the Model C keyboard, which I believe was the arrangement that introduced the 18-unit system. I do not know if this configuration was utilized prior to that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, is this article specifically identified by Lawson &amp; Bidwell as an ATF piece? Updike does not name the &quot;western firm&quot; he refers to. I would have thought that if it was ATF, he would have simply said so. ATF was formed in 1892 and Benton, Waldo &amp; Co. was one of the original founders that merged into it. I can't imagine there was any other sizable foundry left after that to introduce such a system, especially given Benton's patent on the scheme. Yet, Updike says that every type was adapted to this system, which certainly does not describe ATF.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding unit systems: there seems to be some doubt in this forum as to its value. I do not suggest that posters are detractors, but there seems to be a bit of conjecture about its flexibility. Many are aware that when FW Goudy was presented with the task of designing his Goudy Gimbel (38E) for the Monotype system, he found it a long and difficult task, having never before been restricted to the width of his letters. You have to remember that Linotype and Montype were all there was for machine setting in those days. Neither were considered crude or archaic, rather they were thought of as amazing marvels of ultimate &quot;hi-tek&quot; engineering. They now seem to funny to most, but they were the result of a logical evolution from hand-setting to machine setting from recirculated cold types (the Page machine) to the very first Lino and Mono machines, which were even at that vastly different from the first successful operating versions of both.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is understandable that FWG would find this restricting. He did, however deal with it, and the type was a great commercial success, as is evidenced by the fact that many matrix cases of it still survive. I don't find 38E to be the prettiest type ever done, but I don't see anything wrong with its set values or fit. I maintain that it is not terribly restrictive to work within assigned unit widths for a letter. The standard C, C1 and C2 arrangements accommodate a grteat many of Monotype's faces. This is due to none of them requiring unusually wide or narrow boundaries for an a or an e etc. What I am saying is that if a face is based on a kind of &quot;ideal&quot; set of proportions everything works out in the end. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the case of certain new releases it was not uncommon to allow the type designer to create an new set of unit row arrangement for the die case and it attendant keyboard stopbars and caster wedge. This is evidenced in Goudy's Kennerley Oldstyle, whcih uses not only its own keybar arrangement, but is also the first Monotype face to have an expanded system of 20 units. If you look through any jumbo Monotype speciman books you will come to an antire two page spread of noted Special Arrangements that expand on the standard 18 unit C arrangement. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In setting Monotype the keyboard is constantly aware of units and the calculating of them. This is an absolute requirement in the setting of tabular work. In text work one is also constantly aware of unit counting in a much simpler way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was not really aware that Liontype even worked on a unitizes system. What made this a revelation to me is that on the Linotype, the channels (72 or 90 channels) carrying the mats have a goodly space each side of the channels of mats, and I assumed that there was lots of latitude to widen or skinny up a character to some degree. This makes no reference to the problems of an italic and roman being on the same matrrix. So I learned something. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In setting straight matter on the Linotype, a person is not required to count units, merely to keep an eye on the assembler so that when the measure is nearly filled he or she can decide how to fill out the line. As Kent Lew has noted the expanding spacebads do most of the work just like your computer does in setting justified). In some cases, thinspaces are dropped into the line of assemble mats by handl, for situations like small caps. For a few years I was a Linotype operator on dialies and weeklies and did a lot of typesetting. On the Linotype, tabular work was terribly difficult, if the shop did not carry the proper sets of tabular values fixed spaces. If this setting was an a narrow measure, there was little room for more than one spaceband, and it was tough going. The most awkward thing I ever had to set was track results for sulky racing. This had to fit in an 11 pica column, in a special very condensed 7 point condensed gothic whose name I cannot recall. This was so unusual that the racetrack promoter carried his own set of special Linotype mats that he presented to the weekly paper in each town that he travelled to for the season's racing, since he made his money on selling the race tout sheets. Sorry for the walk down Memory Lane. Old guys do that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I suggest is that with Linotype and Monotype the unit system did not cause any typeface to be a failure because of the restrictions of width. I can't think of a face where an s or an a is pronouncedy too wide or too narrow, and I don't think it is because I am easly pleased. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am ignorant of the Sabon a too-wide problem, but my guess is that perhaps it was a conscious and decision by it designer. I don't think that is impossible, since humans do make some odd choices. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's Saturday morning and I have just spent the last five days cutting and recutting an 18 point letter f punch. The matrix is punched and rought trimmed, so this morning I get to cast it an line and fit it . . . so here goes nothing . . . <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JIm Rimmer</div>

The problem I have with understanding Updike to be referring to Benton's foundry is that his date of 1894 would have been two years *after* Benton merged his foundry into the formation of ATF.

I presume you are saying this based on a sample graph that I posted to some other thread a while back, in which a few parameters appeared to be essentially linear. Correct me if I'm mistaken. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What parameters are you examining in ATF faces that lead you to the &quot;parabolic&quot; comment? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Linotype parameters that I presented were the few that I had data for immediately at hand (from the Advance Proofs for Dwiggins's Falcon) &ndash; size of face (i.e., measurement from top of ascender to bottom of descender), height of the capital H, and length of lowercase alphabet.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am looking at the waterfall of ATF Garamond that you sent me. We can, of course, discount the first parameter, since the face on the body in any given design is practically guaranteed to be linear by point size. Since this sample you sent shows only lowercase, I cannot measure the cap H height. But I can &ndash; and did &ndash; measure the lowercase alphabet length. Here is my graph. (Apologies for the large image.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My data &ndash;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Point size (l.c. alphabet length in points): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 pt (86.5) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 pt (94.25) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 pt (103) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 pt (117.25) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 pt (133) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->14 pt (148) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->18 pt (192) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->24 pt (250.5) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->30 pt (305.5) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->36 pt (362) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->48 pt (476) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The y-axis is 1:1, but the x-axis is in a ratio of 10 points for every 1 point size increase; I did this so that it would be readable. Thus you can't infer anything necessarily from the angle of the line, but this doesn't affect its essential linearity. There does seem to be a shift in slope at the 14-point mark. We've noted that there is a shift in the underlying master design at this point, so I'm not surprised.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aside from that, however, this data is essentially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->linear<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Certainly no less so than the Falcon data (which only ranged from 6 to 12 point, BTW). I do not see any parabolic compensation. At least not in set-width: character widths combined with fitting. In this respect, in these cases, ATF and Linotype do not seem very different. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For comparison: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 pt (90) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 pt (98) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8 pt (107) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9 pt (115) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 pt (124) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11 pt (132) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12 pt (141) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am open to the possibility that other parameters &ndash; stem weight, cap-height, x-height, extender proportions &ndash; may not be linear. I will be interested to see data on these.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I will ask you to extend the same openness to considerations of Linotype (or even Monotype) until we have data to examine. I have no personal stake in defending the Linotype drawing office. Linotype just happens to be an object of my study. I remain open to whatever results might turn up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But let's gather more evidence before drawing conclusions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure exactly what's going on. Let me show you what I have, and maybe we can figure things out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First of all, though: You're right, some of what I said is pretty tentative - I'm sorry if I jumped the gun. And some of my [provisional] conclusions are guided by what may be called &quot;quasi-scientific hunches&quot;. I'll try to explain that bit as I go along. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My intentions in this process are to arrive at guidelines for digital type designers wishing to make different cuts of a given design optimized for different sizes. So what I'm looking for is the set of deviations from some &quot;deliberative ideal&quot; that needs to be applied to a given size. The deviations are in width, color, letterspacing, vertical proportions and a bunch of other things. In my (still-ongoing) ATF Garamond analysis I'm measuring 10 parameters, but all in relation to the largest size I have at hand, the 48. This means that my values are scalar. Below is some of the data, for lc alphabet width: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 6: 241 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 7: 225 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 8: 215 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10: 196 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12: 185 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->14: 177 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->18: 179 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->24: 173 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->30: 170 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->36: 168 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->48: 166 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here's what it looks like: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some observations: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- There are two parts: 6-14, and 18-48. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- However, the 14 is suspicious (see below), so the cutoff might in fact be between 12/14 instead. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The smaller-size section is not linear, it's curved. I'm not sure it's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quadratic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->* as opposed to cubic or something else (and the data is probably too sparse and jumpy to ever know), but I gravitate to that because of three things: the next heuristically logical step after linear is quadratic; type is two-dimensional; and Luc[as] de Groot has found that weight gradation proceeds quadratically with respect to the horizontal scale. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- The larger-size section looks mostly linear. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I'm now using this instead of &quot;parabolic&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One big caveat: unlike the Centaur and Falcon specimens, my ATF Garamond stuff is &quot;unofficial&quot;: Mr Benton wasn't there to assure me that each size of what I used is the real stuff. Of the 11 sizes I used, two of them look suspicious: the 14, which is somewhat too narrow; and the 7, which is obviously too light. I'm tempted to pull those out of my study, but there are some good reasons not to, and instead just give this caveat as needed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other nine parameters I've studied even less, but the ones dealing with width seem to behave in exactly the same way as above, while: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Vertical proportions also largely seem to follow the quadratic+linear combination. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Weight seems to be one single quadratic curve. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Stroke contrast looks&hellip; hard to describe right now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To be fair, I guess if you applied this technique to Falcon you'd get the same non-linear behavior! And as you say, your Falcon data (which was indeed my source) only spans the text sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So yes, it's too early to say with all confidence that ATF was better than Linotype at optical scaling. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I've seen a body of anecdotal evidence (as well as just plain tangential observations) that seem to indicate that the Bentons were in fact on another level. I've revealed these to you in private recently, but if people here are interested I'll try to collect my thoughts enough for public delivery. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the face on the body in any given design is practically guaranteed to be linear by point size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've found that this is not always the case. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. I'd like to be able to follow you here, but you lost me with your data. Can you describe how you arrived at those numbers &ndash; give them units or relate them to something known or measureable? I can't figure what those numbers represent, so I can't assess the curve. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the Bentons were possibly on another level with regard to optical compensation.

The interesting thing is that the ATF Garamond is pretty linear from 6 to 14, but from 14 to 48 is not &ndash; *unless* you take out the 14.

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, I think I get it now. I was able to replicate your curve by scaling the l.c. alphabet measurements by the ratio of the type size to your base 48 point.

That's why the division of ascent/descent was established in whole points (thus &quot;Point&quot; Line). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But perhaps I am wrong, and Art Line did not accommodate mixed sizes on a line easily, in which case it may not be so simple to derive from examples. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, Hrant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think I understand that the question is as much about standard alignment of Art Line types as it is their anatomy, and it sort of makes sense that if two faces are both drawn to those paramters, they would match in base-alignment.

If the termination on the baseline of the z descends a little, I pay attention to the horizontal stroke which gives a good indication of the baseline. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a man in Baltimore who own a metal type treasure-house called the House of Type.

There should be a set relationship between the linear graph and the scaled curve, and I don't think that relationship is a quadratic one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I went back to the alphabet lengths given by the ATF book and revised my formula. The text portion of the scale (6, 8, 10, 12, and even 14) can be expressed by y=7.83333x + 40, where x is the point size and y is the alphabet length. (The accuracy of this is within 0.33333 pts of the stated length for 8 and 10, and 0.66667 pts for 14.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you assume a 12-point master drawing and scale everything to that, then the new curve (which is shown in one of my graphs above) can simply be expressed as y = 480/x + 94, where x again equals the point size and y equals the alphabet length, scaled to 12-point equivalency. Again, the accuracy is within about a half a point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's not quadratic at all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, let me try to explain this - as much to myself as to you! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You're physically designing a digital font, and you have the &quot;optimal&quot; design let's say for the 12 point cut. Now you want to alter it to work better for smaller sizes. Assuming you're going to use numbers to do so (or at least get the first iteration), then the relationship of the numbers is not linear. Here's why: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let's say you're working on the width increase. If you follow the ATF Garamond, the ratio you'd adjust for the 8 point is ~115.3%, and for the 6 it's ~129.9%. The percentages 100, 115.3 and 129.9 do not sit on a line when graphed against point size. The point is for example that you can't interpolate (linearly) the 8 point number from the 12 and the 6. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

It's the &quot;higher order&quot; and &quot;quadratic&quot; that I'm having trouble with. When you say &quot;higher order&quot; I imagine that there will be a variable squared or something like deGroot's formula.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I've been attempting to show is that the formula for these curves is actually very simply derived from the linear equation.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me review. The general expression for a linear equation is y = sx + c, where s is the slope and c is a constant, right? The equation for your &quot;scaled&quot; curve is simply y = mc/x + ms, where s and c are still the slope and constant from your linear equation, and m is the point size of your master design.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adding a comment to such an old thread, particularly one which contained a debate that had become acrimonious, may be unfortunate, but I hope that facts will calm things down rather than inflame them. (I had encountered this thread as the result of a web search for the original unit system for TTS fonts.)</p>
<p>The history of the legibility faces from Linotype was, I thought, well known. Alexander Lawson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anatomy of a Typeface&rdquo; gives a good account of it. First there was Ionic No. 5, with low-contrast strokes and a generous x-height. Then there was Excelsior, which was designed to address a problem of ink-trapping that was observed in one particular case.</p>
<p>In high-speed rotary stereotype presses, the rubber rollers that applied the ink had to be made of harder material so that they could withstand more friction. It was at this point that ink-trapping became a problem that had to be addressed in Excelsior&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p>Not ink-trapping per se, but the need to apply ink more heavily so that halftone photographs would print properly, led to a flooding of counters with ink in tabloid newspapers: and so Paragon was designed.</p>
<p>Then a different problem - mold shrinkage - led to the design of Corona.</p>
<p>So while ink trapping was a real phenomenon, it only played a role briefly, and this was basically because presses were being operated in a way that could be expected to lead to poor results.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I came across another thread where it was noted by someone who worked for Linotype that their drawings of type were generally done to an 18-unit system or a 54-unit system, and that this became useful later on, when they came out with a phototypesetter that required this.</p>
<p>That came as a surprise to me, since indeed the Linotype mechanism makes no technical requirement for a unit system - since every space behaves like a quoin.</p>
<p>But this reminds me of something else. Given that the normal assortment of spaces and quads in a job case consists of em, en, 3-to-em, 4-to-em, and 5-to-em, plus the hairline space, and even the hairline space has a finite width, in my naivete, when first exposed to that I would have thought that even foundry type would have to be made to a unit system of 60 units to the em. If slugs of type had widths like pi/4 or sqrt(2)/2, they would drive typesetters to despair.</p>
<p>The favored explanation, though, was that the accuracy to which a line of type needed to be justified was finite, and just touching the sides of a slug would change its width due to one&rsquo;s sweat and the natural oils of one&rsquo;s skin and so on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gochipmunk.com/html/teletypeperforator1.html">http://www.gochipmunk.com/html/teletypeperforator1.html</a></p>
<p>a manual is quoted as saying that the use of TTS equipment to control Linotype machines has become a general practice.</p>
<p>I had thought that the multifont perforators were needed because even Corona wasn&rsquo;t designed with the same number of units per character as the TTS version of Ionic No. 5. That they could have been used to control Linotype machines setting magazines in Caledonia, however, appears not to be beyond the pale.</p>
<p>Of course, this still wasn&rsquo;t an intrinsic limitation of Linotype. Presumably, if indeed this did happen, Linotype started unitizing its fonts sometime in the 1930s, when the advantages of using TTS for other purposes than newswires became apparent.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">TTS was used extensively in newspapers when I was a junior reporter in the 70s. The reason &hellip; Linotypes were expensive, and had limited capacity. TTS punchers were cheaper, and you could have two (or more?) setters working on the TTS to feed one linesetter, optimizing the resource.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Exactly!</p>
<p>One of the original advantages of the Monotype system over Linotype was that the Monotype caster could be kept continuously busy, at an optimum speed, playing tapes generated on multiple Monotype keyboards.</p>
<p>The 18-unit system was a typographical disadvantage intrinsic to Monotype which Linotype did not share. On the other hand, Linotype had the disadvantage that Roman and Italic were normally identical in width (but bold was on separate matrices, and small caps were put in their own locations), and this was more noticeable.</p>
<p>When the TTS system was introduced for newspapers, it was noted that it allowed a Linotype machine to run more quickly and smoothly than one operated manually.</p>
<p>So, given that someone who used to work at Monotype noted that they were designing their fonts to an 18-unit system, what I think may have happened is the following:</p>
<p>Originally, when Linotype was first designed, what you see in the advertisements and the standard textbooks was right. Monotype had the unit system, Linotype had Roman and Italic equal in width.</p>
<p>After TTS was introduced, and people saw the <em>additional</em> benefit of how efficiently it made Linotype machines run, popular demand led to:</p>

<p>So even where paperbacks or magazines, instead of newspapers, were being set on Linotype, the machines could still be used as efficiently as Monotype casters, thanks to TTS being universally applicable.</p>

<p>I think that you may be drawing a conclusion that is not completely warranted.</p>
<p>AFAIK, the Teletypesetter system of tape-driven composition did not intrinsically require unitized fonts.</p>
<p>The TTS system was, foremost, a standardized encoding system for tape perforation that facilitated long-distance [telegraph] transmission of keyed text.</p>
<p>Indeed, a side benefit is that this allowed tape-driven composition on an suitably equipped Linotype machine, similar to the benefit seen on a Monotype.</p>
<p>However, I believe that unitization is a separate issue.</p>
<p>The 18-unit system was an integral part of the Monotype matrix setup and its justification procedure. A unitized system allowed progressive calculation of the composed line and simplified the mechanical computation of space adjustment for justification.</p>
<p>The Linotype, on the other hand, relied upon a physical mechanism for line justification &ndash; the tapered spaceband. So, unitization would not have benefited this process.</p>
<p>I have always understood that the purpose of a unitization spec as part of the TTS system was for standardization in newspaper syndication. Part of the original impetus for the development of TTS was a more efficient means of transmitting news stories. The addition of unitization standards would have allowed a story to set to a consistent measure and length in different newspapers with different body types.</p>
<p>This standardization would not have benefited book compositors.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the whole point of development of the Multiface Perforator was to work with non-unitized fonts and thus a different &ldquo;counting&rdquo; mechanism for engaging other operator functions.</p>
<p>What I do know for a fact, having spent some time analyzing the production drawings of Caledonia (drawn in 1937, well after the introduction of the TTS system), is that this book face was <em>not</em> drawn on an 18-unit system. Although I have not analyzed other designs as closely, I am highly skeptical that any other book faces were unitized either, prior to the introduction of Linotype&rsquo;s own unitized phototypesetting systems.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have just found out some additional information relvant to the question of whether or not Linotype fonts, needlessly from the standpoint of the Linotype mechanism, were unitized due to some external cause.</p>
<p>In the book &ldquo;The Lithographer&rsquo;s Manual&rdquo;, I found that the Fairchild Multifont perforator was intended to allow Linotype machines to be operated through TTS to set fonts other than the newspaper legibility faces. However, this was achieved not just by allowing the character widths to be adjusted, but also by changing the unit system from 18 to the em to 32 to the em.</p>
<p>There was a posting on the Typophile forums where someone who worked at Linotype remembered they were drawing fonts there to an 18-unit system and then a 54-unit system, at least so that these fonts would be usable with their forthcoming phototypesetter products. No one remembers Linotype designing fonts to a 32-unit system.</p>
<p>The TTS system did have to calculate where each line would end. So the existing fonts, not recut, would have to be measured, and their widths - possibly rounded down, rather than up, so that errors would lead to excessively loose spacing, and never less-than-zero spacing - set on the TTS perforator.</p>
<p>So, basically, this confirms your statement: fonts didn&rsquo;t get cut to a unit system at Linotype in the &rsquo;30s because of TTS; this only happened much later, when phototypesetting systems other than the imitation hot metal Fotosetter were on the horizon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And I&rsquo;ve learned something else from this. Having this table in hand, in the context of looking up information about Linotype legibility faces, led me to look at the Presswire faces for the Selectric Composer. Those faces had narrower numerals&hellip; so I thought I would check how well the narrower size matched the numerals used with TTS.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Presswire faces reduced the width of the numerals to 4 units (from the normal 6) in the Composer 9-unit system; but had they been reduced less severely, to 5 units, they would have been a closer match to the 9 unit numerals in the teletypesetter system.</p>
<p>@kentlew:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nevertheless, I would guess that there was a standard established for each size of Art Line that determined the placement of the baseline on the body. That is, I would expect all fonts of the same size, cast on Art Line, to align with each other. Is this not so, Jim?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The system of lining used by ATF, and by other typefounders of that era as well, generally involved three standards.</p>
<p>There was the normal line (ATF: American line; Barnhart: Uniform line; Inland: Standard line), which allowed about 1/5 of the type body for descenders.</p>
<p>There was the Script or Art line (ATF: Art line; Barnhart: Text line; Inland: Script line), for authentic old style faces and script faces, which allowed about 1/3 of the type body for descenders.</p>
<p>And there was also a Titling line (ATF, Inland: Title line; Barnhart: Cap line) which allowed only a minimal area on the type body below the baseline.</p>
<p>Where necessary, increments of 1/2 point or even 1/4 point were used - for the very small type sizes, but the preference was for every size of type, in all three &ldquo;lines&rdquo;, to have a distance from the baseline to the bottom of the type slug that differed from the distance from the baseline to the bottom of the type slug for every other size and style of type by a whole number of points.</p>
<p>So, using only standard leading material, in single points or half points where needed (and 1/4 point only in the extreme case of type at 6 points or less), one could align the baselines of any face with any other, even if one was Art line and the other Standard line, and whatever their point sizes might be. That was why they called it &lsquo;lining&rsquo; type.</p>
<p>In the Didot system, Bauer, and probably others, did much the same thing. The baseline might be 1.4 Didones above the bottom of the type body for one size of type, and 2.9 Didones above it for another; what counted was that the difference was 1.5 Didones, a multiple of half of a Didot point.</p>
