body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI'm doing an exercice in which I have to create a fusion between
  the letters M and R (from Mafalda Remoaldo). I've been doing some research but I
  found almost anything with those letters, do you have any images (Logos, typography,
  etc) that can serve as an example? I'll send this example, that I've made, so that
  it helps you selecting what you can send me[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MR
