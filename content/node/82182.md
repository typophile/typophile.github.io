  distributes space between selected nodes.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Illustrator_3839.JPG]\r\nAnd
  I can't seem to find one in FL5. Searched in the manual, in the internets - no luck.\r\nThat
  would save me lots of time without needing to measure space between nodes, divide
  it by 2 and then position third node in the middle manually."

    to Illustrator, make the adjustments there and copy it back again. \r\nMake sure
    you have an Illustrator document that is compatible to your font metrics:\r\nhttp://haikumonkey.net/2008/04/from-illustrator-to-fontlab/"

    the mouse button, and use the resulting pop-up window to create a guide 50% between
    the two points. Place the point on the guide and then delete the guide.\r\n\r\nOr
    just write a robofab script that measures the selected path segment and inserts
    a point along the way."

    x number of points, type cmmd-= and the reference point jumped to the middle of
    the selection.\r\n\r\nTo damn elegant for FL, I guess."
