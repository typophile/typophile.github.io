  the subject of fake typefaces but whatever I produce will just be typographic..
  \r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion on Fake Typefaces or Fake stuff in general?\r\n\r\nPlease
  help. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nNoono24."

    able to create a facsimile Incunabula page.\r\nMy Scotch Modern attempts the same
    thing, for digital+offset to mimic mid 19th century typography (see present issue
    of <em>Eye</em> magazine.)\r\n\r\nChalet was launched with a fake provenance.\r\n\r\nOneleigh
    is an historical fiction, designed in the style of 1920s historicism, seventy
    years later.\r\n\r\nScript fonts fake handwriting. \r\nDuffy Script fakes the
    random irregularity of a hand-drawn script with programmed multiple contextual
    alternates.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think these kinds of fakery are what you had in

    its name into Google and finds it on one of these sites. The sites don't carry
    a warning or something. Joe Public thinks \"hey this font stuff must be free 'cause

    safe in the knowledge that if it's on the 'web, it Must Be Free.\r\n\r\nSearch
    this forum for posts \"requesting\" (actually, often more like <em>demanding</em>)
    a font so-and-so; read the hurt comments of the people that make fonts for a living,
    and followed by incredulous replies of the original posters. \"Wot, that font's
    <em>not</em> free!? You bunch of rip-offs!\""

    me of something Nick touches on above: Script typefaces that pretend to be somebody's
    handwriting (warm, soft, personal, handmade, and all the blah that comes with
    that), but in fact are fonts that anyone can buy; they only pretend to be the
    designer's* unique, personal expression.\r\nThings that make it obvious that what
    we're looking at is really a font \u2013like repeating, identical glyphs, or connection
    errors\u2013 can be as jarring as realizing that this person who's been beaming
    a smile at you has in fact, not only fake teeth, but a rather fake face altogether.
    So much for masks\u2026\r\n(* I mean the designer using the font in this case,
    not the type designer.)"

    Adobe Sans MM and Adobe Serif MM. If the originally intended font is not available,
    Acrobat Reader will replace it with these fallback fonts, chameleon-like emulating

  body: "Not only handwriting of course, but also hand lettering.\r\nHaven't you made
    a few of those yourself?\r\n\r\nThe process is commoditization, as the skilled
    products of one generation of technology users (e.g. scribes with pens) are automated
    and turned into a commodity (type) which imitates what went before. It's one of
    McLuhan's Laws.\r\n\r\nIn early Photoshop, it was possible to mimic \"airbrush\"
    effects, but difficult, as layers and dedicated filters did not exist. Then the
    effect was commoditized in pre-set filters.\r\n\r\nBut not everyone is beholden
    to using others' tools to make their thing, some make their own tools.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIn
    typesetting, tasks which were done manually -- justification and kerning -- have
    now been automated.\r\nContentiously, InDesign's \"Optical\" kerning fakes the
    \"Metrics\" kerning in digital fonts, which in turn fakes the manual on-demand,
    instance-by-instance kerning of foundry type composing.\r\n\r\n<em>Nick, you seem
    to know a lot about the subject? </em>\r\n\r\nI wrote a series of magazine articles
    2000-2005, some of which address the role of technological change in type and
    design culture, which IMO is the Big Question. They're at shinntype.com, under
    \"Writing\"."

    wasn't suggesting you were. I've argued above that with each generation of new
    technology, much of the fresh output mimics the effects of previous technology,
    and is in that sense fakery, adopting the appearance of something that it is not.\r\n\r\nWhen
    people use a script font that is strongly informed by hand lettering skills, they
    want some of that cachet without paying for a custom job, and quicker and more
    immediately flexible. At the same time, script fonts have their own dialog with
    type and type history. It is a horse of a slightly different color, because the
    typographer can experiment with the setting typographically.\r\n\r\n"
