  pens.  I haven't heard of Greek using this type of pen.\r\nGreek users, is his work
  legit for you guys?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P1hCGPTMZM\r\n\r\nIn
  many calligraphic books, I see Greek only using a broadnib pen."

  body: "As in most of the rest of Europe, the flexible split nib was a typical tool
    for Greek handwriting in the 18th and 19th Centuries, and even into the first
    half of the 20th Century. Modern fashions in calligraphy have tended to focus
    on the broad nib, although this is changing a bit now for Latin script, with recent
    interest in traditional pointed pen scripts and related lettering and ornamentation
    styles. I don't know whether this trend has reached Greek calligraphy.\r\n\r\nThe
    style of Greek lettering shown in the video seems to me neither one thing nor
    the other. The shapes are quite basic and not representative of the Greek writing
    styles of the 18th and 19th Centuries that are associated with this kind of pen.\r\n\r\nSee
