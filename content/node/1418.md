  conversation</a>. The objective is to assemble a list of &#39;recommended&#39; typefaces
  from the Typophile forums. I chose Bodoni as a test case because it&#39;s a large
  part of my world. What I want to know is: <BR>Is this kind of summary useful? <BR>Are
  there things that would make it more useful? <BR>&#42; <BR>When asked &#34;Which
  Bodoni should I buy?&#34;, Typophiles said: <BR> <BR>ITC Bodoni <BR> <BR>ITC Bodoni:
  7 endorsements <BR>Berthold Bodoni Antiqua and Expert: 1 endorsement <BR>Berthold
  Bodoni Oldface and Expert: 1 endorsement <BR>Bauer Bodoni: 2 &#40;1 of which is
  specifically in reference to metal&#41; <BR>Linotype Bodoni Classico: 1 endorsement  <BR>
  <BR>Alternatives suggested: HTF Didot, Linotype Didot, Zuzana Licko&#39;s Filosofia

  typophile names baby after Bodoni <BR> <BR>My relatively broad search on the phrase
  <b>Which Bodoni</b> yeilded 95 threads and hundreds of entries. I read as much of
  a thread as I felt I needed to decide if it was directly relevant to a question,
  and I did a search for the word Bodoni in the page to determine its context. <BR>
  <BR>Other candidates are: Which Didot? Which Futura? Which Garamond? And I am sure
  there are more. <BR> <BR>So let me know what you think. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: This is very useful. <BR>Do you plan on distilling the opinions expressed
    on Typophile only, or accounting for opinions in books &#40;like &#34;Revival
    of the Fittest&#34;&#41; as well? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Right now my plan was to limit myself to Typophile only. And to do this periodically.
    If it gets bigger than that I won&#39;t be able manage. But then on the other
    hand I&#39;d love to know what other sources say too.

    threads &#40;the response to which was great and very helpful to me&#41; and I
    would love to read more advice about other typefaces and foundry preferences.
    <BR>There is an astonishing wealth of knowledge here and people very willing to
    share it! <BR> <BR>Troy

  body: Thanks guys. I think I will continue in this vein and compile more from time
    to time. It was kind of fun and I got to read see and hear neat things as I went.
    The next one will be pretty soon, though I won&#39;t be able to say when. And

  body: Thanks for the effort, Jon, this is very useful. <BR> <BR>One suggestion would
    be mentioning if the endorsement of a particular cut of the typeface in question
    was made with text setting or display in mind.
