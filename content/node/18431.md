  would seem to hold some real promise for stylish typographics. A peek at the movie
  website though reveals more mish-mash than style. I count about four faces on the
  opening page.\r\n\r\nFittingly, they do use ITC Johnston or P22 Underground for
  some...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vfont.jpg]\r\n\r\nA sinister
  redrawing of Gill or Johnston would have been cool, maybe set in a corrupted Tube
  roundel. A little more consistency would be nice. The posters page inside the site
  shows quite a mix of styles."

    on?\r\n\r\nI was about to check the typographic style within the original graphic
    novel myself, but I must have loaned it to somebody, as it's not on the shelf.
    Drats. I have no idea who/when I loaned it to - it must have been a long time
    ago.\r\n\r\nT"

    body: Yes! I'd forgotten about <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?SFEMPSREGMC.htmlm">Priori</a>.  Given
      all the cutlery in the movie I'm sure they want pointy V's. Johnston's are flat
      on the baseline. I'm unfamiliar with the comic or graphic novel. Maybe I should
      ask my kids...

  body: "Ok, I have the graphic novel, not the original individual comics. The typography
    of the novel design is inconsistent, the cover jacket has something like Univers
    Condensed and Eurostile, inside there seems to be a mixed use of Eurostile/Bank
    Gothic(!!) and Univers Ultra Condensed (but not quite), the R is different. The
    combination of eurostile and bank gothic throughout is not pretty at all... almost
    if the designer(s) did not notice the difference between the two.\r\n\r\nThere
    is some ITC Kabel in there! ~ Page numbers and headers are set in ITC Kabel Medium.
    :)\r\n\r\nP.S. The chapters are set in an art deco typeface, drastic."
