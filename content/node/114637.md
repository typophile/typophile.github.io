body: "Inspired by some lettering on an old Soviet-era electronic device, I have started
  working on a minimalist, future retro font I'm tentatively calling \"Elektromuzika\"
  in reference to the source. Since I am not a native speaker of any language that
  uses the Cyrillic alphabet, I am looking for some other sets of eyes to look over
  what I have so far and let me know if these forms are acceptable and legible - bearing
  in mind the design choices made to fit into the over all style and mood of the font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elektromuzika_6541.png]\r\nFour
  weights - Light, Regular, Medium, Bold. The Medium and Bold styles are closest to
  the original lettering but I'm really digging the light. Some of the more out there
  design choices, such as the sliced off descenders on the /De /Tse /Schcha etc. were
  present in the original.\r\n\r\nI don't hate the name, I think it works well in
  English, but if I were a Russian speaker I'd probably think it very odd - so will
  probably end up changing that. Still a lot of work to do. For instance, I need to
  work on some of the glyph widths to produce a more even flow. Final product will
  include full latin glyph set."

  body: "That\u2019s really nice attempt! It feels nostalgic.\r\nSome critics:\r\nI
    think \u0416 in light weight should be wider and I\u2019d raise the kratka (breve)
    over \u0419. The accents on \u0451 in regular, medium and bold are out of place.\r\nP.S.
    It should say \u042D\u043B\u0435\u043A\u0442\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0443\u0437\u044B\u043A\u0430
    with first letter \u042D\r\nI\u2019d also consider making some ukrainian and belorussian
    letters, just to make the typeface more useful for more people."

  body: Thanks for your feedback. I've done quite a bit of work on it since, mainly
    on the latin glyph set, but I have added the Ukrainian and Belorussian. Once I
    am happy with this next stage I'll post an update.
