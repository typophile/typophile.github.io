  BT]], a font designed by Oakville, Ontario-based Canadian designer Boris Mahovac
  R.G.D. of Alphabet-Design.com\r\n\r\nBoris Mahovac has adapted a friend's handwriting
  in this new font called Kloi (pronounced Chlo - ee). It has a very casual feel and
  includes <em>alternative swash glyphs</em> of some key characters as well as some
  <em>extra ligatures</em>.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the ligature and contextual
  swash features in OpenType, the alternate glyphs automatically replace the standard
  glyphs when appropriate, creating a very unique look.\r\n\r\nKloi BT is Boris Mahovac's
  second font design released by Bitstream, after Tabita BT, another free-form display
  typeface was released in 2006.\r\n\r\nKloi BT is available in PostScript OpenType
  format. Kloi\u2019s extended glyph set covers the Western and Central European,
  Baltic and Turkish languages. "
