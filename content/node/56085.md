body: 'I am curious if anyone can help me. Am looking for a complimentary typeface
  for Mrs. Eaves. I was going to purchase another Licko font (I think there is a Mrs.
  Eaves san serif, yes?), but really am short on cash. I have Adobe Type Basics OpenType
  Edition, purchased for my classes. Can anyone list some wiser combinations for me?
  I am still in the basics of typography. Some combo''s I have thought: Gill Sans,
  Lucida Sans, Helvetica Nue, Frutiger. I think I picked these, because these are
  the only ones I have leaned towards, that is from my typography class approved typefaces.
  Any help, will be appreciated.'
