body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm a student of architecture and I'm trying to create a resume
  at the moment using InDesign.\r\nI've had a look at some other examples which have
  been posted on this forum, and followed a few 'design tips and tricks' type tutorials
  that I found on the internet, and this is what I have come up with so far....\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface I'm using is Adobe Garamond Pro with the sub-headings set in 11pt and the
  rest of the text set in 10pt with 12.75pt leading. That box in the top right hand
  corner is for a passport type photo to be added to later, as the places I'm applying
  to require that. I like the layout more or less, but it still looks cluttered or
  awkward to my eyes and I can't work out why.\r\n\r\nAny comments or feedback would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Firstly the dotted lines add a lot more unneccessary activity to the page
    - try making them lighter and solid.\r\n\r\nAlso in the professional experience
    section has a few issues - the city name and time period which is aligned to the
    right margin looks out of place with the unjustified text immediately underneath
    it. It also doesn't run very easily with the company name and position headings
    on the other side of the page. I'm not necessarily suggesting you justify the
    text, but you could try that. I'd suggest either putting the city name and time
    period under the other two headings, or left align them to a tab rather than right
    aligning them.\r\n\r\nThe headings in this section also don't differntiate themselves
    enough from the text - add some sort of hierachy there; maybe the grey colour
    you've used for the text with the headings black? A different weight, different
    size, or maybe even a sans?\r\n\r\nThe text does feel all blocked up, but probably
    because there isn't any hierachy or contrast going on anywhere, so it all looks
    rather homogenous.\r\n\r\nI also don't think the circular bullets work well with
    that font.\r\n\r\nHope some of that helps (not that I'm any expert, just a student)\r\n\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "Reduce your tracking, increase your leading!  My eye goes down instead of
    across, especially in the \"Professional Experience\" section.\r\n\r\nThe bullets
    look out of place... In general, get rid of all (or most) lines, and think of
    the text itself as the visual elements.  For the dates and locations, perhaps
    move them to be right after the names of the firms - try italic, or lighter grey,
    or something to deemphasize them.  Where they are right now is unscannable and
    ugly.\r\n\r\nResumes need to work as a glance, a scan, and a read - I agree with
    rafe that right now it's all a bit too homogenous.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
