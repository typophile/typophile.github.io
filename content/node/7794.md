  body: I can&#39;t bring myself to spend $20 just for a font... can anyone suggest
    a good &#34;look-alike&#34; font that&#39;s free?

  body: Jon, where do you live? In Manhattan you can see all the art at the new MoMOA
    for $20 to get into the door. Just think you can use that font over and over but
    if you visit the museum it a one time fee.

  body: And a day pass at Dollywood costs $35, so the MoMA fee is a bargain. &#40;Have
    you been to the renovated MoMA yet, Daniel?&#41;
