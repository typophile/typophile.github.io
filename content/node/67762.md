body: "Hi all, this is my first post, so I hope I'm doing everything right.\r\n\r\nMy
  late grandmother had this book entitled \"Humorous Poetry\", and since there's no
  copyright / colophon, I'd be really interested in help in finding more about the
  book and the typeface used for the body copy. The book is a collection of poetry
  (from Chaucher and the like)... I found an <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/humorouspoetryof00part\">archived
  copy of it</a>, with the copyright date (mine has the copyright page missing) at
  c.1884. Can I assume this was (or close to) the publication date?\r\n\r\nI've attached
  a specimen of the font and I also included a photo of the cover for interest's sake.
  The floral capitals and embellishments on the cover are really neat.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    saying that, there are a few different cuts of this font, so perhaps someone out
    there will be able to specify which, if indeed it is Caslon."

  body: "That was my first thought too \u2014 the italic J with the crossbar threw
    me off, none of the Caslon's I looked at had that feature. Also, the specimen
    in the book has old style numerals."

  body: "My guess was more Baskerville or a related face. The italics are particular.
    For example...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/baskerville_classico_italic/?&sample_text=John%20Gilpin&update=0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    proportions are not 100% but one differentiator with Caslon is the lower case
    h. In Baskerville it ends out, in Caslon it ends in.\r\n\r\nI would also note
    that so many Caslon/Baskerville faces do not carry the classic italics but have
    modernized them considerably. Go for the old ones - they're delightful!\r\n\r\n--Kelsey\r\n\r\nThis

  body: Jan, it makes no sense being Adobe Caslon, since this text is visibly older
    than digital typesetting, and you can see it's metal type. But Caslon nonetheless.

  body: "You're right Jan...\r\n\r\nThese additional identifying characteristics check
    out for Caslon:\r\n1. cropped apex on 'A' (harder to make out in the metal version,
    but I assume it's there)\r\n2. bowl curve of the 'p' overlaps the stem (although
    I'm not sure that's unique to Caslon)\r\n3. long serifs on the middle arm of 'E'\r\n4.
    large loop on italic 'k'\r\n\r\nThere are others but I'm sold.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    making me look a little harder :)\r\n\r\n--Kelsey"

  body: It's definitely handsetting, although I'm not particularly familiarized with
    the specific methods used on this work. From what I can see, although pretty might
    the book be, the choice of paper and it's treatment might have not been the best,
    but that is as far as I can tell.
