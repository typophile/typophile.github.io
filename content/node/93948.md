body: "Hello Typophiles.\r\n\r\nBesides of being a type lover, I am also a big football
  fan. \r\nI know that big events like <strong>UEFA Euro 2012</strong> brings new
  typographic custom made football kit  numbers to the football kit of every national
  team.\r\n\r\nLike Commercial Type foundry did for <a href=\"http://commercialtype.com/uploads/200002/1330453840231/Bent-483-xxx.jpg\">England
  national team</a>, every national team have his typeface that show up in games and
  in commercial ads.\r\n\r\nI think it is a really interesting topic to post here
  what you know about every football kit number / typeface (e.g: like who made that
  typeface, and some links of interest); in that way, making here a little collection
  about numbers, and about typefaces in football kits.\r\n\r\nSo, if you know something,
  brig that knowledge to here \r\n\r\nBTW: Czech Republic kit numbers are quite interesting!\r\n\r\nBest
  Regards\r\nF\xE1bio Santos"
