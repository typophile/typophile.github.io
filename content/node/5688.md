body: hey. this is a poster for a concert at The Eaves &#40;see logo forum&#41;. the
  main band is casiotone for the painfully alone. they are sort of lofi glitch pop.
  think 80s beats through a low tech casio keyboard with him singing over it. he sings
  alot about being lonely and that his house is full of mice. <BR> <BR>the poster
  will be letterpressed on 17x23 mohawk superfine soft white paper. im going to do
  an edition of about 40 and sell them at the show for around $10 each. <BR> <BR>this
  whole concept is really early. so ill be devloping it heavily over the next couple
  days. i like the first one waaaay more than the second, but thought i oughtta post
  both. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40986.gif" alt="">  <BR>

  body: The first one has problems with legibility - the hand distracts too much.
    I also don&#39;t think the hand&#39;s style matches the type. What is the story
    behind the rat/mouse? <BR> <BR>The second one is too messy, does the hands have
    to be there?

  body: He is &#40;or used to be&#41; from Portland, where I live. I haven&#39;t heard
    his music, as I have been scared off by the ridiculously awful band name. However,
    your poster is already looking better than any I&#39;ve seen around town for his
    local shows. Thank you for not using shaky cursive script, pink, or anything that&#39;s
    blatantly too small &#40;indie pop design clich

  body: thanks for the words john. i certainly was trying to avoid hand scripted pink
    and blech. squiggly line drawings of.. anything. thanks for noticing. your from
    portland? i may be moving out there next year. <BR> <BR>here&#39;s the next version-no
    major design changes, just had to add the name of our visiting artist and change
    the colors, which actually is apartial solution to the readability issue. <BR>
    <BR>the two colors are pms 381 and 3115. if anyone besides me out there is a pantone
    whore i know youve already run for your books. anyway, ive done some testing,
    and on letterpress these two ink - when laid on top of eachother - create a green
    that is deeper and brighter and either by itself. should make the name pop. but
    a little readability trouble is fine with me. dont want to make it too easy on
    the viewer. ha. <BR> <BR>that green looks super yellow on my moniter, but its
    green. like the pantone. thoughts? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41296.gif"

  body: I really really love the hand/glove. Colours in the most recent revision look
    good. <BR> <BR>The 80&#39;s type isn&#39;t strong enough to avoid being overpowered
    by the strength of the glove. I think you should fill the channel in the characters
    with either white &#40;which would really pick it out&#41;, or if you&#39;re bothered
    about the number of colours, fill it in with either the green from the mouse or
    the background colour. Just to stop the glove interferring. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    think the mouse and the hand are working together in the composition. It would
    be nice to see the hand over the mouse more implying protection, or the gap between
    the thumb and the forefinger cupping the mouse&#39;s body. At the moment they
    feel quite seperate.
