The problem comes about when such end products are sold and or given away for free, under the guise of &quot;new&quot; designs, and usually without proper credit to their true origins.  <BR> <BR>The Emigre Fonts license does allow the user to alter the characters in a font as long as the user has purchased the appropriate user license and the altered fonts continue to be used in accordance with this license. In addition, the altered fonts must retain the original Emigre copyright notice.  <BR> <BR>When you alter a font from the Emigre library, the resulting font(s) will remain the property of Emigre. Legally these adaptations are considered 'derivative works,' and as such they remain the property of their inventor.
