  Kennerley bold]] (a face Nick recently mentioned in [[http://typophile.com/node/51171|another
  thread]], coincidentally, though his comment went wooshing over my head) for the
  covers of a series of books, but I'm not totally sold yet. Can anyone suggest faces
  with a similar look to the samples below?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI like the wedge serifs,
  the width, and the touch of roundedness and informality, but maybe the latter goes
  too far (or maybe the real issue is it wasn't designed for display sizes?).\r\n\r\nLTC
  Garamont has the same kind of feel, though I like it a bit less \u2013 attached
  too."

    and digitized pretty much all of them?

    disregarded Bethold's because it doesn't have bold small caps. But it may be that
    I should just pick the best (for my purposes) of those three. The bold all caps
    actually looks pretty close to bold small caps when resized to the same width.\r\n\r\nI'm
    working on a side-by-side comparison, will post when done..."

    a very diverse group of glyphs, in hindsight :)\r\n\r\nFirst impressions: the
    Beatty small caps are more squat than I'm going for. And the Beatty caps lose
    too much of the color I like about the Lanston. So I'm left squinting at the Lanston
    and Berthold..."

    at all... Anyone?
