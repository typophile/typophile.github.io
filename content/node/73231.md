  \r\nWhat do you think? too simple or common? just let me know your feelings.\r\n\r\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/i/testopierluigigiglio.png/\r\n\r\nthanks

  body: I'm not sure why you included ".com" in the logo; most logos don't include
    it. If you feel it's really necessary, I'd suggest experimenting making those
    letters smaller or lighter in weight than the rest of the logo.

  body: in addition to James' comment above, if you're set on keeping the ".com" in
    the logo, then remove the space in between your first and last name as it would
    not be present when typing the url of your website. However, if you do remove
    the ".com" (I would suggest this) then the space is fine.

    a perfectly round one instead of Helvetica.

    the .com , it is worthless after all as the logo will be viewed in my website.
    \r\n\r\nakos.polgardi : do you know some similar fonts ? I can't seem to find
    a similar to helvetica , I like the style , but I feel it's been so used ...\r\n\r\nthanks

  body: Here's my suggestion. Use Founders Grotesk like nina suggested and make it
    a litle condensed in photpshop so that the outside of the e is pefectly round.
    I think you should be able to twist it a little this way, without disturbing the
    overall image.

    spending those 50 buck. Founders Grotesk looks awesome as it's very similar to
    helvetica, but I can't seem to find a way to see how it's going to look. I wouldn't
    be happy if I spend 50 bucks and then figure out that it doesn't look great !
    \r\n\r\nDo you know where I can find a way to view it and enter a sample text
    with that font? \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help,\r\nPierluigi"

    Grotesq but the only difference that I spot is the \"g\" wich is more ornated

    you alot anyway.\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

  body: "If the g is the only diffenerce you can find I don't think you should start
    as a graphic designer. I don't mean to be rude, but it seems to me like you haven't
    had enough education on graphic design. The one thing that makes your logo your
    logo (the e) simply looks wrong. So what your left with is basically nothing.
    Normally I would have given you some advise on how to make a better logo, but
    as far as I'm concerned you just got to get the whole idea out of your head.\r\n\r\nbe
    wise."

    self brand that I made is more to show people my capabilities rather than market
    myself as a fake designer (as I am now, but I'm looking forward to improve) .
    I am a knowledge/education first kind of person too, please don't get me wrong.\r\n\r\nAnyway
    I expressed myself badly before. I should have said the only BIG difference that
    I notice is the g but, again, it probably is my untrained eye.\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

  body: Now were getting somewhere. I like the way you made the pencil, but I think
    it's hard to recognize if you don't know it's a pencil. You should make the pink
    /+/ black; it draws to much attention now. Keep making progress! Just a simple
    logo for your own comapny is not as simple as it may sound.

  body: I would consider changing the face used in the subscript to something more
    compatible with Helvetica. Also, it might look a bit more subtle if you use the
    'pencil i' only once (using it twice feels a bit arbitrary to me) while you could
    make it more obvious by drawing a chipped top (as on a sharpened octagon-based
    pencil). It's certainly getting better though.

    Thank you for the tip , the bottom text could be better but I don't know wich
    font I could use actually. Do you have any suggestions? The i on the pencil will
    definetly be repeated once . Maybe on the last \"i\" ? As for the chipped pencil
    I'm sorry but I couldn't understand how to improve the shape, could you please
    explain your idea again?\r\n\r\nThanks again to everyone,\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

  body: Looks much better, but I'd remove the vertical lines in the pencil and I'm
    still convinced the '+' should be made black, OR the whole 'brand + graphic designer'
    should be made pink. Try using some different fonts for 'brand + graphic designer'.
    Good Luck.
