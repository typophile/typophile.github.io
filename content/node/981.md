    easier to spot flaws then... It looks great in my humble opinion though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    <BR>but i&#39;m not yet satisfied with the outlines of lc z and k... <BR> <BR>besides
    that, i&#39;m resizing the UC to make the font a little bit more modern and legible

  body: ' The Y is very upright.. maybe you could follow the angles of the W more
    instead of the X &#40;I mean just slightly&#41;. Is it just me or does the VW
    seem to be descending too much? And the z is a little too above the H line. I
    would like to see the uppercase and lowercase interacting some..  <BR> <BR>Its
    cool. I like it. especially with the word &#34;fox&#34;. '
