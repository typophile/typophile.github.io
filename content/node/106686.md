  Preferable fashion or luxury brands (but not a must).\r\n\r\nTo be more specific
  I\xB4m looking for examples where the standalone brandmark is used rather consistently.
  A lot of fashion brands uses their logotype as the main logo and the standalone
  brandmark for special occasions \u2013 not as a part of their main branding elements.
  \r\n\r\nThe best example I have so far is Strellson. On strellson.com its rather
  evident that: 1. the two things are used apart and 2. the brandmark is used actively
  and rather consistently as part of the branding. On chanel.com for example the brandmark
  isn\xB4t really used \u2013 only the logotype.\r\n\r\nIt can be debated whether
  Chanel\xB4s CC mark is actually a brandmark or an emblem (or whatever) but in this
  context it does\xB4nt really matter.\r\n\r\nAnybody have some good examples to share?\r\n\r\nHelp
  would be very appreciated, thanks :)"

    Apple, for example, the symbol is so well known that in signage, on web pages,
    etc, they typically just have the apple logo and don't include the company name.\r\n\r\nIn
    the case you mention of Chanel, the brandmark is indeed used on some pages, such
    as http://chanel-news.chanel.com/en/home.html (at the bottom). But my guess is
    that they thought the CC mark by itself may not be recognizable enough by folks
    who don't currently use their products, so they decided to spell it out on the
    main pages."

  body: Well, I guess these are obvious from high fashion, but there's always Louis
    Vuitton's LV emblem (used in e.g. patterns), Versace's medusa head (in clasps,
    belt buckles, etc.), Emporio Armani's fairly hideous bird thing (patterns, belt
    buckles), Ralph Lauren's polo player, Fred Perry's laurel wreath and Lacoste's
    crocodile (ebroidered on shirts)... Chanel may not use the CC on their website
    but it certainly appears on e.g. sunglasses.
