  did for a school project and give some people entertainment for a couple of minutes...
  since only typographers would probably understand it completely. :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJQMshmF6s\r\n\r\nYou
  can post comments and crits. Thanks! :)"

  body: Hehehe. My brother will enjoy this. He and his friends used to dress up as
    ninjas and watch all of these movies, shortly followed by running outside into
    the dark of night and throwing stars and whatnot at the cats.
