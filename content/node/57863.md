body: "i've been seeing this font a lot lately...it appears to be similar to the font
  used for Aldo shoes and Nautica clothing (albeit different weights), though those
  might just be simply Trade Gothic, which is popular in the fashion industry.\r\n\r\nThe
  face i'm trying to identify is quite classic, but has some subtle features that
  continue to thwart my search.  It's the face that the text \"Paul Lee Design\" is
  set in on the site below:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.paulleedesign.com/]]\r\n\r\nAt first
  i thought it was Trade Gothic, however, take special note of the rounded G.  Trade
  has a straight line from the bottom of the lower curve to the x-height.  i also
  looked at Aviano (fairly new typeface, and a good one), but no dice...the curve
  at the bottom of the U differs slightly.  i also thought perhaps Zeppelin 42, which
  is very close, but again lacks the curve at the front of the G.\r\n\r\nAnybody have
  any thoughts?  Thank you"

  eluding me...
