  from illustrator indeed.\r\nCheck this out:\r\n\r\nand i found blend fonts option
  in FontLab, but.. it doesn't work properly.\r\nI know I supose to check all hints,
  courve etc. but i don't understand what exactly i must change.\r\n\r\nMy font is
  so simply I mean I designed the bold version based on my logo then i just generate
  3px outline in illustrator and expand it with improving and making a joint.\r\n\r\nHow
  can i make another weight? i just need only weight between thin and bold\r\nThere
  are some difficult connection between, but most of all are so simply.\r\nMay you
  can help me?"

    everything else will be a lot easier."

    cannot just blend two incompatible outlines and interpolate a family. The math
    doesn\u2019t work that way. You are so still at the beginning that you have not
    even grasped the complexity of what you are getting into. Read the stuff again,
    slow down, build your compatible fonts, and experiment with interpolation a few
    letters at a time until you have figured out how it works. Trust me, it will take
    you a while to really wrap your brain around it.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, this
    stuff is much easier to do in Glyphs or Robofont. FontLab\u2019s multiple master
    implementation is a buggy heap of shit."

    If you work with Fontlab you have to work with its strict\u2014and buggy\u2014implementation
    of Adobe\u2019s multiple master system. Components do not work correctly, creating
    the MM font from extant font is a PITA, and you cannot use an arbitrary number
    of masters. Glyphs and Robofont are much simpler. In Glyphs and Robofont you just
    add another master layer for each master and dump the glyphs in (or just draw
    them in one font from the start). If your curves have the same number of point
    Glyphs does a great job of ordering paths, setting start point locations, and
    flagging incompatible glyphs. This whole process is much more intuitive in Glyphs\u2014but
    not especially well documented, so you have to figure some stuff out yourself
    or email Georg."

    i can't found where's the interpolation panel. I just imported light font and
    added bold to master. Most of all glyphs are fagged of brown color and a couple
    are not flagged at all.\r\n"

  body: "Glyphs does not have a standalone interpolation panel. Everything is done
    by adding masters in the font window. Set your master font weight settings are
    set to a common stem width (such as the stems of H). Then all you have to do is
    plug in the stem widths for the instances as you add them. Stem widths can be
    determined either by working with various interpolation theories or by using existing
    type families as a model.\r\n\r\nIf the glyph has a red flag in the upper left
    then the outlines are not compatible. If the outlines have matching paths and
    points then \u201CCorrect path direction\u201D will fix start points and glyph
    orders to make them compatible. Sometimes glyphs cannot work out path order and
    you have to fix it manually by copy/pasting paths in one-by-one from the background
    layer."
