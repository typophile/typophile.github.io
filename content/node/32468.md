  idea to do work for friends, because it can ruin a friendship\" in many different
  incarnation. I am wondering if anyone can point me to a resource where someone has
  explored this philosophy in something like an article or a study? \r\n\r\nYou see
  I have a friend that is insisting that I help him with a project and -- in this
  case especially -- it just really seems like a terrible idea. I know I have read
  people's positions on this in several different places, but in my moment of need
  I cannot turn any of these sources up.\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    you this is not a good situation, you are probably right. I have made the mistake
    twice because it is hard to turn down a friend in need. Both times I regretted
    it. The hard part is telling them you can't do it. I guess that is why you are
    looking for someplace to quote chapter and verse. That way, you can show your
    friend that it is not you who thinks so but this high, exhaaulted, published authority
    with impeccable credentials who is one step shy of god :-)\r\n\r\nWish I had one

    visits my in-house day job and knows that we (Other Designer and I) keep a fairly
    laid back atmosphere in our office. His interpretation of this atmosphere is that
    we are not very busy and we can stop whatever we are doing whenever he sticks
    his head in the door.\r\n\r\nInitially Friend asked Other Designer for help and
    when he wasn't satisfied with their working relationship he came to me because
    I am easier to work with (this is not the first time someone has expressed this
    to me after dealing with Other Designer).\r\n\r\nI advised Friend that he started
    this project with Other Designer and he should finish it with, but Friend refused
    my advice insisting that I am the one who can help him. I listened to his ideas
    and issues and re-advised him to go back to Other Designer or find someone else
    because in my mind it is not a good idea to take over a job that the other designer
    I share on office with has already been working on.\r\n\r\nBasically it boils
    down to: Friend is thick skulled and determined that I am the man for the job.\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    friends, I take the opposite tack from aluminum. For friends, whatever I do is

    full price, and free. With friends, I'll also say up front that I don't believe
    I can do something when I don't believe in it, or don't have the time, whatever
    -- it can be hard to do good work when you don't believe in something. Of course,
    with paying clients, you put on your professional hat and do your best as a professional.
    Friends are different, they aren't approaching you as a professional, but as a
    friend who has certain skills."

    a good designer to my mind, I have often worked with people who treat design as
    though it is a guild secret that nobody can learn unless they pass an apprenticeship
    and it is a tactic that can work, allowing a free rein to do what they want rather
    than what the client needs (although that is not necessarily the result). Clients
    are, thanks to computers and glossy interior magazines (okay, a simplified list),
    becoming more design savvy and more inclined to have a <em>vision</em> and you
    have to be able to guide them to or away from that vision by explaining the reasons
    that it isn\u2019t serving their needs, but it does require experience and persuasion
    and sometimes demonstrating to them to explain why it won\u2019t work (sometimes
    you fail). It is in the experience and persuasion that you, hopefully, gain their
    respect.\r\n\r\nAs for work for friends, I have used Charles\u2019 methods and

  body: 'I think a lot of this discussion revolves around who you friend is, whether
    or not you get along well with him/her. I worked for a friend recently and it
    worked out well, and I was paid. Examine your friendship carefully before committing
    to working with or for him or her. Is your friendship based on a shared interest
    in your profession or is it based on something else? Is it a real friendship?
    I guess that, as one gets older, an understanding of friendship becomes clearer.
    And that understanding of friendship is rather important. I agree with Aluminum,
    while working for friends you still have a client/designer relationship and if
    they are good friends as well as good professionals they already understand that. '

    them or not: Before doing any work at all, or even saying "maybe", get all the
    expected results down on paper, in the most concrete terms possible. When someone
    says they expect you to do a logo for them, they might be happy with the 2nd thing
    you show them, delivered as an eps, or they might expect you to do unlimited revisions,
    for months, until you happen to come up with something they like, after which
    they want 3 versions, plus ones for web, plus black and white, in 5 formats including
    WMF, plus, plus, plus. You would want the deliverables spelled out in either case.
