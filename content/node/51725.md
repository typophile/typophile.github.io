body: Hi everyone, I am new here. I've been reading the different posts and news and
  this site is great, I am glad I found it. I am an architect, not a graphic designer,
  but I am doing a book project and I need to find a complement to Cocon. Does anyone
  have any suggestions? I would like something that is harder edged to complement
  it. Thanks for any ideas!

  body: "Hi Stephen, \r\n\r\nThe book is about the independence of the Catalan region
    from the rest of Spain for the Republican Left of Catalonia. So, the topic is
    pretty controversial. Typically these kind of independence / nationalism things
    have very bold type , asserting a feeling of power, etc. I want to use a more
    \"friendly\" font such as Cocon for the large type. But I need another font as
    well for the other text. There will be no bodies of large text, however, mainly
    one sentence or two on a page. It basically is a book / pamphlet about the unique
    history/ culture of Catalunya and why now is the time for increased freedoms.
    \r\n\r\nThe audience will be Catalunians and outside political parties. I want
    it to be presented in a friendly, conversational tone. \r\n\r\nThanks for any
    help, suggestions. \r\n\r\n"
