<p><cite>Now the actual scalable font <em>implementation</em>, the *.ttf file or whatever, would be copyrightable (for good reasons) (but not bitmap fonts, maybe ironically).

<p><cite>The font will be openly licensed and is still in production and not expected to be fully completed until the end of March.

<p>Reports that this is not the final version of the logo are correct - the final version depends on the typeface currently in development - but this is a good indication of the direction in which we&rsquo;re heading.</p>

To be fair, these are just the kind of shapes you come up with on the basis of that concept.
As far as I am aware, this concept was first explored by [[Hans Reichel]] anyway, both Prokyon and the Ubuntu font seem to be inspired by his work (and its success).</div>

<p>Looks like you have proven me wrong. In my first post above I was cautious enough to say &ldquo;As far as I am aware&rdquo;, should have stuck to that. Maybe we can agree that Reichel was the one who popularised that style?</p>
<p>Other, even older examples would be Gill Sans, especially the italic, and Joanna.</p>

See <a href="http://www.kltf.de/stuff/wagner_kristall_grotesk.jpg" target="_blank">this scan</a> of an undated but obviously rather &lsquo;new&rsquo; Kristall Grotesk specimen by Johannes Wagner.** The generic joint seems to be the default &lsquo;u&rsquo; in all sizes. The 28p shows this in the &lsquo;n&rsquo; too. Unfortunately I do not have specimens of the older versions of this typeface, so cannot check if this visual feature can be found there too, and in which letters.</p>
<p>If a logo relies on this visual feature alone, this does not necessarily constitute plagiarism, given that this feature has quite a history already. What disappoints me more is that not long after Prokyon&rsquo;s appearance, at least two other typefaces showed up which merely said, &lsquo;me too! me too!&rsquo;
Dax predates Prokyon but due to its odd proportions and roundness is more of a fancy display face, as are Bernhard Gothic and Gerstner Original, while Prokyon is a &lsquo;serious&rsquo; text face of quite a different character and quality.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Florian, I did not know Aeonis before reading your comment.  :)</p>
<p>Mr Savard, when you say, <cite>if every sans-serif font which looks squarish but has rounded corners is plagiarism, design space will shrink</cite>, this is too much of a carricature.
Doing something similar to something existing is not per se plagiarism. It is more about doing something too similar, which &lsquo;too&rsquo; is defined by context &ndash; the context of other typefaces. As long as there is only one crisp text face with said special stem-to-shoulder solution, then if someone else designs a crisp text face using said stem-to-shoulder solution too (even if a number of letters differ), then it is evident that this someone merely wanted to do &ldquo;something like this&rdquo;. But once there are five or six typefaces sharing common characteristics, then you may speak of a genre, these typefaces constitute a new design space: The existence of many similar typefaces forces us to spot (and create) even finer differences <em>within</em> this design space which actually broadens this particular design space. For example, there are quite a number of typefaces of the AG genre, or of the DIN genre, and it seems still possible to come up with new facets within these genres or bridging two or more such genres.</p>

<p>Arno, is it really that difficult to believe that one could independently produce such letter shapes given even passing familiarity with the spurless look? I&rsquo;ve looked at Prokyon only in passing a long time ago, but if someone asked me to draw a logo for Ubuntu in Prokyon&rsquo;s style, I would have no trouble producing these kinds of shapes. Even if I had never seen Prokyon but merely had some general exposure to other spurless sans serifs, it would be easy to duplicate them. They&rsquo;re really simple shapes!</p>
<p>As you can follow in the thread it isn&rsquo;t even easy to establish who came up with the idea first, probably because it&rsquo;s such a simple idea. All I know is that I see spurless sans serif faces everywhere; in advertisements in the Paris metro, for instance.</p>
<p>A few years ago I started designing a slab serif with a spurless look in some letters. I think I took the idea from the Perpetua &rsquo;d' and made it a recurring design feature. Then I posted it to the crit board here, and someone pointed out the striking similarities to FF Signa, which I hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>So I know from personal experience that the same set of simple design ideas can result in a typeface similar to an existing one even if one hasn&rsquo;t even seen the existing design. You can knock the failure to innovate, but you can&rsquo;t throw in accusations of piracy in those cases.</p>

<p>I miss the logic there. There are two typefaces that look very similar. And in this case it is evident, that the earlier one was the pattern of the later one? But in the moment a third typeface is created that looks very similar to both of the later ones, the evidence gets lost? That is not logical. And the passage that I quoted is not logical independent from the context.</p>
<p><cite>If you had read my comment more carefully</cite>
But I admit, that you are right. I had not read your post very carefully.</p>
<p><cite>Unfortunately, the title of this thread is misleading already. A logo can hardly be a ripoff of a typeface. And this discussion is but the logical consequence &hellip;</cite></p>
<p>As far as I have understood, there will come a whole Ubuntu font or font family. So let’s wait for the other outlines of the upright style and the italic.</p>
<p>By the way, my main problem with that Ubuntu typeface and Prokyon is, that more than one person has the bad idea to create such an ugly font. On the other side humans have more bad ideas than good ones. So the probability, that two persons have the same bad idea is higher than the probability, that two persons have the same good idea. In my opinion the whole genre, to which Prokyon belongs, is damn ugly. But you probably did not forget, that I am not a professional. Maybe you can discover the beauty of Prokyon only, if you are a professional. (No offence, I have a deep respect for the talents [in combination with the extreme patience that typedesign requires] of many of you!)</p>
<p>With regard to the simplicity of the idea (@ Chris), simplicity is not per se a symptom of quality. Even if I would get a free license of Prokyon, I would not use that font. The Ubuntu typeface is a ripoff of a rape of beauty. It does not have a constant aesthetic temperature, but looks like a walk through rooms with very different temperatures. If the typeface would be a house, I would get the gout. It looks like tube food, where the one end of the tube still was in liquid nitrogen, while the other was in bathwater.</p>
<p>However, even in science two persons have sometimes exactly the same idea, independent from each other, when the time for that idea has come.</p>

<p>To me, Karsten’s argument makes a lot of sense. As long as you have a monopoly on something, you would, understandably, frown upon competitors who come up with something similar. As soon as you are just one out of many offering ‘the same’, you need to bring your customers to take a closer look, and set yourself apart from others on a finer level. Regardless if you originally had been the first or not. 
Once, there has been a first sans-serif.</p>
<p>More spurless sans-serifs that you won’t like, and that are not in Stephen’s list:

These shows words in a typeface which differs from the ubuntu logo design. See &ldquo;brainstorm&rdquo; and &ldquo;forums&rdquo;. Since all there is right now is a logo, I am surprised how anybody can have strong opinions about a typeface.</p>

<p>Hehe, naturally! It just was a good opportunity to say, what I think about that damn ugly genre. In an ideal world only the ugly things would be pirated. But unfortunately thiefs have the same sense of taste and humor (!) than the other humans.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a question:</p>
<p>When I was hired in HEL Media Lab, they already had Diesel as a client. They had the childrens clothes line, and came up with Protokid, a net community based marketing system. Something quite new at 1996.</p>
<p>They had already made a logo based on Barmeno, and my first job was to take the logo, finish it, and I ended up with this:
<img src="/images/old-images/logo_5086.png" alt="">
and then turn it into type family. This is what I came up with:
<img src="/images/old-images/Proto_6058.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, are these based on Barmeno? Or are these based on a logo? I&rsquo;ve never used Barmeno; I&rsquo;m not a fan.</p>
