  the Font failed miserably. R seems to be key, with S and A also important. Thanks
  for your help.

  body: Thanks. I knew I knew what it was. That fits perfectly (though I think its
    been tampered with (the rest of the logo has as well). The distressing is just
    because they only have the logo as a jpg. And yes, I've been doing projects for
    Penn for years now, mostly through Hillel. However, I myself am a Drexellian (?).
