  body: "There are vertical dashes in CJK fonts. You may have to resort to using those.
    Otherwise you can use the | for an em-dash. I don't know what can replace shorter
    ones, though, except in the CJK punctuation range, q.e.d.\r\n\r\nA horizontal
    dash in vertically stacked letters will look like a separator. That may be adequate
    in the context of the specific use, or it may not necessarily convey the meaning
    you intend."
