    Display you want to Show Measurements in units of millimeters.\r\n\r\nAnd sure
    enuff, when you open the Paragraph dialog, Indentation is now set in millimeters,
    but Spacing > Line spacing: \"exactly\" > the measurements are still in points!\r\n\r\nSo
    the only way is to calculate how many points to set. Not too difficult; 72 points
    per inch divided by 25.4 millimeters per inch comes to 2.8 points per millimeter.
    Multiply by 6 equals 16.8 points.\r\n\r\nI think. Try it. See if it works.\r\n\r\nj

    If you write there \xBBExactly: 6 mm\xAB, the next time you open the Paragraph
    Dialog you find \xBBExactly: 17 p\xAB."
