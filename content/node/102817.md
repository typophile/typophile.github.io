  feature in it that doesn't work in Word 2010. The ligatures work in InDesign CS3
  and CS6. Only Word 2010 won't play nice.\r\n\r\nAny ideas as to what might cause
  this?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen"

    work in Word 2010 and those whose don't.\r\n\r\nOne that does NOT work in 2010
    but does work in other programs (InDesign CorelDRAW) is Times New Roman. Opening
    that TTF in FontLab I don't see the fi and fl ligature substitution in the liga
    feature.\r\n\r\nIs there some other feature from which the other programs might
    be getting that substitution?\r\n\r\nJust looking for clues.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen"

  body: "TNR has a dlig feature, which Word apparently doesn't use, but InDesign and
    CorelDraw DO use.\r\n\r\nSomeone on FontLab's site suggested adding a dsig feature
    to font as Word contains a bug that needs a dsig to ligatures. I've seen info
    where that was needed for kerning to work but hadn't heard of it for the ligatures.
    Will give that a shot and post back for anyone who's interested."

  body: "Yep, it was the absence of the DSIG table.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the below
    post I used TTX to decompile and added the exact \"dummy\" DSIG that is on this
    page and presto, I had ligs. There is a very succinct excerpt from another Microsoft
    page on this page that describes things. Basically for Windows to recognize the
    font has having OT features it needs to have a DSIG table.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/90383\r\n\r\nThanks
    for answering Charles, nice to hear from you again. You likely don't remember
    but you saved my bacon a couple of times on this very forum when I was first getting
    into OpenType.\r\n\r\nInteresting point about the rlig, however, from the things
    I've found and reiterated here it sounds like NO OpenType features work unless
    the DSIG is present, and its now Word that's doing it but the operating system.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!\r\nKen"

    about which layout engine to use for a given text string based on the characters
    involved. So Arabic characters are passed to an Arabic layout engine, which processes
    {rlig}, among other things. But that doesn't mean that characters from other scripts
    will be passed to a layout engine that processes {rlig}."
