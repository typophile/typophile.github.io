  body: "Here\u2019s an interesting puzzle: how do you uppercase a small caps symbol?
    In the IPA there are a couple of them: \u0299, \u029F, \u0262, \u0274, \u0280,
    \u029C, \u029B, \u026A, \u028F, \u0276. Everson didn\u2019t have to deal with
    any of these because they represent sounds that aren\u2019t used in English. There
    are a bunch of other ones used in non-IPA phonetics inventories, like \u1D00,
    \u1D01, \u1D03, \u1D04, \u1D05 \u1D06, \u1D07, \uA730, \u1D0A, \u1D0B, \u1D0C,
    \u1D0D, \u1D0E, \u1D0F, \u1D10, \u1D15, \u1D18, \uA776, \uA731, \u1D1B, \u1D1C,
    \u1D20, \u1D21, \u1D22, and \u1D23. There are even Greek ones around like \u1D26,
    \u1D27, \u1D28, \u1D29, and \u1D2A. Even Cyrillic makes an appearance with \u1D2B.
    There aren\u2019t Unicode case pairs for any of these, but how would someone design
    an uppercase version of a small cap letter without it looking the same as the
    ordinary uppercase?"

    So why not make \"uppercase\" size versions of lowercase letters? The opposite
    of small caps is \u2026 large lowercase!"

  body: "Well, if Michael is using uppercase in his <em>Alice,</em> then he is not
    really using IPA, since the IPA alphabet has no uppercase (and doesn't need one).\r\n\r\nJoe,
    I think 'transliterating' is the wrong term to use here: transliteration refers
    to script-to-script text mapping. The IPA alphabet provides for phonetic transcription
    of spoken language, which I presume is what Michael is doing: i.e. transcribing
    the oral pronunciation of the text. And that's an odd project, since English pronunciation
    isn't exactly standardised. I wonder, is the transcription how Michael pronounces
    it? how Dodgson would have pronounced it? how someone in the Ozarks would pronounce
    it?"
