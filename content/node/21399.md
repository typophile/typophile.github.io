  body: "Alas, none of the digital Coptic fonts I have looked at have been of very
    good design quality. I presume you've seen the various free ones available at
    e.g. http://www.travelphrases.info/gallery/Fonts_Coptic.html\r\n\r\nCoptic is
    on the list of scripts to be supported by the SBL Font Foundation, which means
    I hope have the pleasure of designing two Coptic fonts (one Sahidic, one Bohairic)
    in the next couple of years, but I presume your need is more immediate."

  body: I'm not qualified to determine which Coptic fonts are well-drawn, but MacCampus
    are specialists in non-latin scripts. Here's their <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=K.9455.0.0">Pachomius
    Coptic</a>.
