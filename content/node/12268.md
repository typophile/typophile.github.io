  tell me what finally means information design, i'm very confused right now. \r\n\r\nI
  need a book that show the right way or the principles to design forms, documents,
  letters, financial documents, Bills & statements, Customer letters, etc... I have
  the examples in these URL: http://www.enterpriseidu.com\r\n\r\nI've been looking
  on the internet, and the only thing I find are old books, and i want something newer,
  between 2003 & 2005. Also any good book of information architecture (for web design).\r\n\r\nThanks

        Roger Fawcett Tang and its been a great source of inspiration in terms of
        presenting information graphics. \r\n\r\nI can only reiterate what has been
        said about Edward Tufte and that all his books especially visual explanations
        are very concise but beautiful to look at...well I think so anyway ;) "

    clear, understandable communications by giving care to structure, context, and
    presentation of data and information. As a field, its principles relate to all
    communications products and experiences, regardless of medium (print, broadcast,
