  illustrations and ads. I was wondering what font choices the typophile community
  would recommend.\r\n\r\nI am a big face of deco display faces, but I am having a
  hard time deciding what would be an optimal body font. \r\n\r\nThe wrinkle that
  complicates things is that the visual style of the book is a combination between
  the 1970s and the 1930 after the books 2 protagonists. \r\n\r\nI am mainly concerned
  for the print edition at this point, but something that would be able to be embedded
  in an ebook would be a plus.\r\n\r\nMany thanks"

  body: A lot of the sci-fi books I have from the 1960s-1980s were set in metal versions
    of Times or Plantin, so I associate those with cheap paperbacks, but they were
    totally fine to read.

    I would recommend using the semi-bold for any bolding needed in the body text.\r\nDon"
