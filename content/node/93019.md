  body: "Like most things in a relativistic universe: it all depends. One man\u2019s
    Medium is another man\u2019s Book, and one or the other might be more suitable
    depending on the size used on the webpage. However, because of all the variables
    involved, I doubt that you can come up with a hard, fast rule that says \u201CAlways
    used Regular for sizes 14px and below, and always used Book for sizes 15px and
    above.\u201D\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one size does not fit all, nor is your calling
    plan really unlimited. Welcome to Twenty-first Century America."

    body: Drat!  I've always considered myself a "Book" man, but now, I'm not sure
      sure.  I will lay blame on the  Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Physics.

  body: "A Book in a publication that\u2019s is printed on bad stock by an indifferent
    printer may turn out looking like a Regular. A Regular printed on expensive glossy
    paper by a printer who does not know his job may look like a Book.\r\n\r\nIt depends,
    in other words, on circumstances. Study those, or work with printers who are knowledgable\u2026"

  body: "<em>On average\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nI seem to recall a similar discussion here,
    in which it transpired that in some faces Book was heavier than Regular, and in
    others vice versa\u2014which would tend to undermine the principle that an average
    is meaningful."

  body: Try it with different fonts with both Book and Regular weights and see what
    you think.

  body: The OP should refine their question a bit.  Are they talking about body text,
    headlines, sub-headers?

    body: sorry, body text.  Though at this point I'm not sure it's worth pursuing,
      given the variability between typefaces?

  body: Well, "regular" can change from face to face, but "book" is always designed
    to be used in body text.

    and Roman (Book is 45, which is labelled Light in Univers; both call 55 Roman

    a few FontFonts have both:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/celeste\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/info-text\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/kievit\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/max\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/meta

  body: "The FontFont ones seem slightly thicker than the Regulars, unlike the Avenir
    one, which is the other way around.\r\n\r\nSo is the Book weight for printing
    at smaller sizes (like a multiple masters) over the regular?"
