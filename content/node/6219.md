  bla, bla... but i think that, genetica or mini7 will be really used on the graphic
  design on 20 years in the future, for been part of the retro begginning of computers,
  internet, etc...as a display fonts but how much time we can wait for this? <BR>

  body: I can&#39;t agree more. Pixal fonts will be the sign of these times. <BR>It&#39;s
    like with alias fonts around, no one can remember that it was possible to live
    without them and still have nice looking fonts in Flash at a small size. Such
    as in this <a href="http://nikegolf.nike.com/nikegolf/">Nike Golf</a>site. <BR>I
    love them now though.
