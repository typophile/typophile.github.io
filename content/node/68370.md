body: I really like the font and want to use it on business envelopes. Not sure if
  the text in BOLD is the same as the rest. Thanks a lot

  body: Indeed. And particularly for something as serious as a Master of Business
    Administration. Makes you wonder about the Graduate School of Management and who
    they're trying to appeal to.

  body: 'Stephen, what I intended to say was: What makes you think this is Type Wrong?
    It could as well be a scan of Courier, with the distressed look caused by the
    reproduction, no?'

  body: "Oh, right. Yes, I see what you mean; this could be a result of natural grunging
    (old school-style). :) With the abundance of roughed up fonts like this available,
    I guess I just assumed it would be one. Now on closer inspection I see that some
    of the flecks and bites are inconsistent: the 'r' and the 'i' in the first Administration
    and the 'n', 'a' and 'i' in the second, suggesting it's not a distressed font.
    \r\n\r\nBut even if the original is Courier, there's some serious horizontal distortion
    going on. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Courier_4350.jpg]\r\n\r\nEven
    the wider forms of Courier New don't come close to the original sample. Anyway,
    at the very least, you're right, it's not Type Wrong and more likely a version
    of Courier distressed through reproduction. "

  body: 'Stephen, thanks for diging deeper! I agree with you: probably horizontally
    stretched Courier. Type Wrong could serve as an out-of-the-box alternative if
    the distressed look is important.'
