  body: "OT doesn't work on characters; it works on glyphs. There is no concept in
    OTL of 'end of selection'.\r\n\r\nAre you actually trying to reduce the size of
    the glyphs, as shown in your example, or is this just an illustration? In order
    to achieve this appearance using OTL, you font would need to contain sized alternates:
    you can't actually change the font size via OTL, and in any case a change of text
    size normally terminates a glyph run for OTL processing."

  body: "I am trying to reduce the size. Someone asked me if it was possible to have
    an effect like this in an OT feature. If so, I would have drawn four or five sets
    of sized alternates and substituted them counting backwards from \u201Cend of
    selection\u201D.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve answered my question and obviously it can\u2019t
    be done this way.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "You could do it with a trigger glyph. So rather than having the context run
    backwards from the end of the selection you would insert the trigger glyph at
    the end of the selection and use that as the first context glyph. You would use
    a series of contextual lookups, something like this (using VOLT syntax; sorry,
    I don't do AFKDO):\r\n\r\nletter -> letter.smallest\r\n| trigger\r\n\r\nletter
    -> letter.smallerstill\r\n| letter.smallest\r\n\r\nletter -> letter.smaller\r\n|
    letter.smallerstill\r\n\r\nletter -> letter.small\r\n| letter.smaller\r\n\r\nand
    finally you would remove the trigger glyph from the string like this:\r\n\r\nletter.smallest
    trigger -> letter.smallest"
