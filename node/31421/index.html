  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am wanting some input about what other InDesign-via-windowsxp users are running as font managers. I am currently using ATM Deluxe and I hate it. I have had all the usual problems with InDesign not recognizing fonts that other programs do. I have always found a quick fix; be it installing fonts through the control panel, copying shortcuts of the fonts into secret InDesign Fonts folders, hunting down conflicts from PS and TT versions of the same font, etc. But I am running into problems more and more, and have decided that somethings gotta give.</p>
<p>I started looking at other font managers and I found a lot of old forums of mix-emotions for each program, but no real reasons that one was better than the other.</p>
<p>Also, at my workplace, there are four typesetter/graphic design hotshots, each sporting their own collection of good, bad, and ugly fonts. We also do in-house printing, and the prepress guys have a melting pot of everyone&rsquo;s junk fonts. Right now it is every man for himself, and the fonts are freaking out.</p>
<p>For this reason I have lately been looking server-based font management and was wondering if that is pretty much the way to go, or pretty much not the way to go&hellip; Pros and cons&hellip; likes/dislikes&hellip;</p>
<p>From what I have read, having a single location for fonts to be installed from, with restricted access, would eliminate the problem with multiple versions of the same font (or &ldquo;evil twin&rdquo;) problems that I keep running in to. Or am I mistaken? It would also be nice to restrict the installation of unapproved fonts that one of the &ldquo;others&rdquo; downloaded from &ldquo;Bill and Ted&rsquo;s excellent font lab&rdquo;. As I am led to believe, this power can be held by one single dictator, or is all this just wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Please let me know your thoughts.</p>

<p>I checked the download section of Extensis and it seems this is ready to try.  You have to download two programs to fully evaluate the server aspects.</p>
