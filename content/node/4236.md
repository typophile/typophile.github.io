  body: Nope. There&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-53-extended/"
    target="_blank"> Helvetica Extended</a> or <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=BQ900380X1P1&amp;start=1"

    target="_blank"> Grotesk Extended</a>, but no Arial Extended. I once suggested  <BR>it
    to David Saunders way back in 1993 who was then with  <BR>the Monotype Drawing
    Office &#40;before the merger with Agfa&#41;. <BR>I literally told him &#34;Why
    not make an extended version of  <BR>Arial? The world can use some more extended
    faces.&#34; <BR>That was shortly after I had found out there were only very  <BR>few
    &#34;wide&#34; faces in the FontBook. <BR> <BR>They didn&#39;t follow the advice
    of a one-year-in novice at  <BR>FontShop Belgium, can you imagine that?! <img

    I&#39;m not pulling yer leg, this is a true story, I kid you  <BR>not. This is
    <i>SO</i> funny you bring this up after all those years.
