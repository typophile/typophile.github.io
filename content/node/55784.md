  type collection is in Mac Suitcase format. My sign company uses only PC (as the
  cutting and ripping software isn't as developed for Apple) and I have been trying
  to get a few workhorse fonts converted over from the Mac to the PC.\r\n\r\nSo, in
  FontLab I run a Transform Range to batch convert about a half dozen type families
  (Gotham is a good example, as it contains ultiple weights) to TTF. Should be a no
  brainer, right?\r\n\r\nGet them onto the PC, and when I try to install them either
  through ATM or directly into the directory, it offers an option only for 'Gotham.ttf,'
  which is a randomly chosen weight out of the family. I can't add Black and Light,
  for instance, as it notes that the font is already installed, despite the file name
  being different.\r\n\r\nWhat do I need to do in order to get these font families
  translated over correctly?\r\n\r\n\r\nMike"

    & Frere-Jones) directly and requesting proper PC format fonts. In the case of
    this particular family, I'm not sure that this kind of conversion is within the
    scope of your license.\r\n\r\nThat, or convert to outlines."
