body: "Klavika has been selected as the new face for an engineering recruitment agency
  who is having a modest rebrand.\r\n\r\nI'm having a lot of trouble selecting the
  right font package!  I'd love to buy the whole family, but its quite expensive,
  so I'd rather have a subset.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my problem.  Klavika comes
  in four weights: light, regular, medium and bold.  Basic packs include all weights
  but exclude small-caps, tabular figures, old style figures etc.  I'm not too fussed
  about the figures, because the face will mostly be used for the website, business
  cards, brochures etc.  But, I dont want to go without small-caps, because I use
  these all the time.  So that rules out basic packs.\r\n\r\nThen there are normal
  packs, which come with all the extras, but limited to combinations of: light + medium,
  or regular + bold.  Great!  But I think I want light + regular!  Because regular
  is the best weight to use for the logo, and Light will be great at larger sizes
  for headlines on the website.\r\n\r\nI guess I could buy the full family - but as
  mentioned, its quite expensive.\r\n\r\nWhat would you do?\r\n\r\nI guess I could
  buy the single weights for light + regular, but I would be kicking myself if I later
  find a need for the heavier weights.  I'm pretty new at this, so I'd appreciate
  any thoughts on how I'm going about this, or things that I might have missed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJon

    compared to some of the families in the $1000+ range. I'd buy the big set and
    recoup the cost by using it in projects for other clients down the line, not to
    mention other projects for this client. Treat the cost as an investment, not just
    $300 spent on one cheap identity job.\r\n\r\nIf the big pack is just too expensive,
    however, it seems like light+medium would be a lot more useful than light+regular;
    light and regular are just too similar to build an effective hierarchy."

    a one-off license for use in this particular project, maybe a payment plan. You
    never know, unless you ask. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: As generous and friendly as Eric is, I don't think it's worth his while to
    work something out for a single license sale. jpad has the right idea. Go for
    the complete set. You'll be glad you did.

  body: I find that once I buy a new font I end up using it quite a bit which helps
    defray the costs. Klavika is a great font.
