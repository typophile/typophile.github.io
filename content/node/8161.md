body: Over the past year I have designed about 10-20 typefaces using CorelDraw. What
  would be the least expensive &#40;legal&#41; way to turn these into real fonts?
  What advice would you give to someone in my position &#40;a newbie on the font scene&#41;?
  Any help will be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR> - Lex
