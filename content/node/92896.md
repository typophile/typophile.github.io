    body: What sizes would you like? I can create them from the original images, or
      is it the fact they are hosted on dropbox?

  body: "Mostly it's not OK to name the sizes based on one manufacturer. I know that
    people have trouble with technical stuff, but there should at least be an alternative
    way to get the one you need, based at least on your screen's aspect ratio (which
    is more significant than the pixel count for something like this). For example
    the iPhone's screen is 960\xD7640, which is 3:2 (which is uncommon). The two main
    desktop aspect ratios are 4:3 and 16:9 (the latter gaining a lot of ground lately,
    although most projectors for example remain at the former). There are also secondary
    ones like 5:4 and 16:10. AFAIK most non-Apple smartphone aspect ratios are 16:9.\r\n\r\n*

      know their monitor''s pixel size than the aspect ratio. '

  body: "True, but even that's becoming too much to expect. This dumbing-down includes
    ignorance of the names of the resolutions (like XGA for 1024\xD7768) so you're
    left with nothing. When you shop for a monitor you have to dig for resolution
    info - all they tell you is the inches. And when you shop for a laptop often all
    they you is junk like \"720p\", which isn't even accurate.\r\n\r\nI swear Forest

    by resolution and added 16:10 versions  also. Hope this helps.\r\n\r\nRory"
