body: I'm going nuts trying to identify this wide, geometric sans which I've seen
  on my local Fox channel's news graphics and most recently on the Screen Actors Guild
  awards on January 23, 2010. I've come across likely candidates (Trade Gothic Extended,
  Aviano Sans, Doublewide) but none of those have the exact letterforms, especially
  the sharp point angles of capital M and W. The letterforms have the sharp angle
  characteristics of Metro sans (Dwiggins) but in an exaggerated extended way. The
  news channel graphics have shown this in upper and lowercase, while the SAG awards
  used all caps. HELP! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SAG_6115.jpg]
