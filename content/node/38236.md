  body: I assume you don't have Fairfield and Parisine? First, keep in mind that many
    foundries have student discounts. Second, for us to provide alternatives it might
    help for us to know what is available to you.

  body: "Palatino is similar to Fairfield and is a font most people have access to;
    in fact, I had a project where I needed a Fairfield substitute, and Palatino is
    exactly what I used--it worked swell. Microsoft's True Type imitation of Palatino
    is Book Antiqua. I think you should stick to Venetians if you want to get the
    same look and feel as Fairfield.\r\n\r\nParisine--wouldn't any nice humanist sans
    work too? Frutiger immediately comes to mind as an accessible but less sterile
    alternative to Officina Sans; if you have FF Meta, that would be an ideal alternative
    for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nStephen--tell me about foundry discounts for educational
    users, I'd be very interested. I'm a faculty member, so I ought to qualify. Gotham
    please....\r\n"
