body: I'm designing a 600-pg book which will have some color photo galleries but is
  primarily text. It will be printed on an Indigo. Any suggestions for a good text
  paper?

  body: "Are you using a commercial printer to print and bind this book? If so, it's
    a good idea to ask them for a recommendation. They will have experience with what
    runs well on their press and makes your color images look good.\r\nIn seeking
    your printer's advice, try to balance opacity with bulk. You want paper that's
    thick enough to prevent your color images from showing through to the backing
    page, but thin enough that your 600-page book isn't a cinder block.\r\nAlso ask
    about the suitability of the stock for the binding process. Some heavily coated
    papers don't lend themselves to perfect binding, because the adhesive sticks to
    the coating and not the fibers underneath, making the book prone to crack at the
    spine.\r\nSabine Lenz at [[http://www.paperspecs.com| PaperSpecs.com]] may be
    able to offer additional advice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't do much print work anymore (mostly for the web these days), but one
    suggestion is to talk to your printer. Most printers have house stocks that they
    can offer good prices on since they buy in bulk, plus they are very familiar with
    its characteristics. And a good printer should also be able to recommend some
    higher-end stocks if that's what you're looking for. Obviously photos will look
    best when printed on coated stock.\r\n"

  body: Paper variaties for printing on an Indigo are limited, unless you are willing
    to have some prepared (coated). Just ask the shop what is available and choose
    from that, because custom papers can be problematic and will probably not be warranted
    by the printer.

  body: The best paper for the Indigo is chemically treated, so that the inks sticks
    to it better. Ask your printer samples of what "HP Certified Substrates" they
    have in house. Any certified paper will be great for print, so it will be up to
    your subjective opinion of what you like - gloss coated, uncoated, matte, synthetic,
    recycled, etc. Non certified offset printing paper can be used and can be less
    expensive, but I'd stay away. It is well worth it to avoid the offset paper dust
    and ink powder.
