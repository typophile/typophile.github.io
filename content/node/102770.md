body: "Hello there\r\n\r\nI'm designing a 3D letter, like Steingruber did with his
  [[http://www.spamula.net/blog/2005/10/steingrubers_alphabet.html|alphabet]].\r\n\r\nBut
  for the letter build, I would like to go in a calligraphed way.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAs
  I couldn't find a weapon of choice to make it in 3D, I decided to draw the iso-lines
  of the basic shape tool -tend to be used as a pen-, and use each iso-line to draw
  the letter's iso-lines as separate letters.\r\n\r\n[[http://kepfeltoltes.hu/130504/von_sok_www.kepfeltoltes.hu_.png]]\r\n\r\nHere
  are the iso-lines of that pen shape:\r\n[[http://kepfeltoltes.hu/130504/alapelem_szintvonalak_kicsi_www.kepfeltoltes.hu_.png]]\r\n\r\nMy
  question is, how to construct an iso-line based on that, for the letter?\r\n\r\nMore
  precisely: how to use a 2D shape as a pen tool, when accurate geometry is needed?\r\nLike,
  there is a function for that in gimp, and the scatter extension come close to it
  in inkscape, \r\nbut none of them nail the problem.\r\n\r\nIs there an automatic
  workaound for that? \r\nIf there is no such, how would you construct a curved stroke,
  drew by a \"random\" shape?\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically I want to draw them in a vector
  format that could be imported to blender.\r\nAnd, as the 3D work would need, draw
  the curves from many nodes, in right positions."

    this a theoretically correct way to construct tangent points to the stroke?\r\nActually
    the curves are not much of a problem as the 3D model will be based up on the nodes.\r\n\r\nHere

  body: "Interesting.\r\n\r\nA lot of the terminology you're using seems to be coming
    from the world of 3D animation (something I myself used to do, but in the dark
    ages) which few type design people are familiar with, so it's a little hard to
    follow.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly that you want to do 3D calligraphy, I
    would say that -to make it more interesting than merely dragging along a blob
    to make letters- you need to analyze what makes 2D calligraphy more than writing
    with a ball-point pen.\r\n\r\nI'm sadly not a calligrapher, but I've been paying
    attention, and I believe formal calligraphy is based on manipulating a one-dimensional
    shape (namely the flat, wide tip of a broad-nib pen) in one or more of three ways:
    translation (movement along the 2D Cartesian space), rotation and modulation (pressure
    = releasing more ink); note however that not all three of these are always used;
    also, in <em>type</em> what the pen wants is often ignored. Furthermore -normally-
    the pen is always pulled and never pushed.\r\n\r\nExtrapolate these to 3D:\r\n-
    The tip of your pen must be a 2D form. What shape should it be? Probably a parallelogram.
    But what aspect and cant?\r\n- Translation is very easy - just add depth.\r\n-
    For rotation you need two dimensions, not three: the direction the pen tip is
    pointing is what limits it to two.\r\n- For modulation you need to figure in which
    dimensions the pen can swell. Is it two or three? Not sure.\r\n- Lastly, what
    is pull/push here?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    here it is:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/von\xE1sok_4124.png]\r\nThis
    is for a plan on the 2D overall shape.\r\n\r\nA simple serif \"B\" letter with
    a \"\xB0\" mark, and only 2D positions of the pen is modulated, so no rotation
    or scaling of the pen during the moves.\r\nBut it's true the calligraphed could
    mean those as well.\r\n\r\nHere is a render of the pen shape:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adisp2_3879.png]\r\n\r\nHere
    are two renders on the current model:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disp3_6032.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disp4_4190.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    these are not that important, considering if I cannot answer the question on a
    2D stroke constructing, it won't look good in 3D."

    formal writing / calligraphy / interrupted scripts the pen is always pulled (downstrokes
    only as in n) and never pushed. But in  cursive writing/calligraphy the upstrokes
    connect the downstrokes may be pushed (upstroke as in <em>n</em>). In informal
    writing / calligraphy / running script the upstrokes are always pushed.\r\nThe
    Stroke by Gerrit Noordzij may be an good read when you are interested in that
    subject.\r\nGetting the tangents right is troublesome indeed. I wrote something
    about that subject on page 20 of my brochure entitled [[http://issuu.com/fontfont/docs/ff_din_round|FF
    DIN Round digital block letters]].\r\n"
