I was hoping some here have had some experience with WEFT and would be willing to share. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I saw an earlier thread that you took part in that talked about the ease of swiping embedded fonts. That would be a conscern. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think our problem is as a design studio that designs mainly for print we are having trouble thinking in terms of type variables that you get with the web. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I understand and accept it, but the designer that I am working with to create our site feels funny about not controling certain aspects of the user's interface, such as the type choice and treatment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the things I do not like about WEFt is that it is not cross platform or cross browser. So, even though you may be able to control the type on PC's using IE, you still ahve to account for NS and Mac's and thus you are back to the basic considerations with web design that you are trying to eliminate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does not seem worth it, really.

I wonder if it's a GASP issue, since the larger Times text in the boxes does render smooth no matter if CT is on or off. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the issue is the GASP settings, then it's really a matter of making sure the font is hinted well if you're using the range of sizes where smoothing is off (assuming CT is off). So it's not the technology's fault, more like a combined limtation of the hinting in a given font design and the font rendering algorithm in Windows (which is however the best out there, except maybe the Kaasila stuff). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I need to do more testing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, what do you guys know about security: how easy it is to extract a font from an EOT/WEFT page?

We are cool using it for some simple navagation, but we want to keep the site content in HTML to make it easy to search and easy to update. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second, as to the designer I am working with - well he is prez of our studio and cut his teeth in print. I agree that he should just get over the control issue, but with everything, life is never that simple. I am moving him toward the right mindset for this project, but I can't just make demands here. Sigh. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think WEFT is a cool idea, but not worth the effort. If we still have to account for variations in text we might as well just go simple and worry about other aspects of the site.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">setmajer, it's great to see you've put a lot of thought into this stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Flash's rendering of small text is notably inferior to OS X's native rendering <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not really. Flash can render the highest form of text (handmade grayscale bitmaps) more reliably than MacOS (and even Windows) can. Flash also has the advantage of allowing kerning - very important for onscreen readability (and legibility). HTML doesn't kern (does it)? The grayscale bitmap font I'm finishing up has over 600 pairs just within the alphabetics (although only about 10% are likely to show up in normal text), and it's only a sans! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not saying Flash is ready for prime-time in terms of extended reading, but I do think (not least by observing the wanton behavior of the OS/app makers) that it has more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->potential<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than HTML. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; improving online reading would be better focused on a base of HTML <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The main problem with that is that with HTML you're relying on the OS, and neither of the two major OSes (if you can call 5% market share &quot;major&quot;&hellip;) can deliver handmade grayscale bitmap fonts as well as Flash. They just don't care enough. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I've never once gotten a call from an irate CEO &hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ah, but you've also not gotten calls from clients who decided never to contact you in the first place. That's my point. Flash enables a level of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> greater than HTML (elbeit flawed in some [important] ways), and that helps justify your existence as a designer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;  which is going to do more to increase material wealth: spending &hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And by the same logic: Which saves more money, hiring a designer or doing it yourself? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; how does serving unstyled pages to everyone not using IE/WIn maximize 'cultural benefit'? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Design is the artful balance of compromises. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trying to make everbody equally happy just makes everybody more miserable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; If playing to the strengths of the medium is somehow 'fundamentalist', <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; then pass the bible 'cause I'm in a thumpin' mood. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But if it means ignoring its weaknesses, and trying to achieve some sort of &quot;purity&quot;, then that's not design, that's art.

How much about Flash do you really know? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is there a &quot;religious&quot; reason you look the other way? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; it seems that kerning should be applied at the same level, no? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You're the HTML expert. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know that Flash applies kerning - show me that HTML/browsers do. I hope so, actually. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; You have to convince them to go with Flash in the first place, no? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You mean the client? Well of course that's the whole point of this discussion! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But my concern here is specifically extended reading (if you look back you'll see that). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I was actually also talking about stuff you make for yourself. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flash can attain a higher level of readability, and it's doable now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Maybe you save a few bucks by only testing in IE/Win 5-6 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When did I say that?! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Hrant seems to think that the general best practice for web design is to make two versions <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only if it makes sense to spend the money - most sites don't really need to look so hot. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the same token however, most sites don't need an especially good designer! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some sites though really need Flash (I'm not talking about extended reading here) to convey the right atmosphere. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
