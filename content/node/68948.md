  an art project, a friend is looking for readily accessible fonts that would approximate
  these. \r\nMy first suggestions were:\r\n- For ROLEX, an expanded, emboldened version
  of Open Baskerville\r\n- For EXPLORER and SUBMARINER, Copperplate regular or light\r\n-
  for SUPERLATIVE CHRONOMETER, ?\r\n\r\nWhat would you use to emulate these?"

    fonts. The font you linked to is a copy of Clarendon.\r\nThank you."
