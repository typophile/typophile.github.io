  myself good enough in english...sorry) and i\xB4m making a book with another friend.\r\nI
  have some questions about the \"tracking\" and i was trying to get some information
  about it but i couldn\xB4t find a good answer.\r\nI\xB4m using Garamond to compose
  the main text (wit InDesign) and i\xB4m not sure about how \"long\" should be the
  space between the letter in a line.\r\nI know, it depends of the type (Garamond
  in this case) and the size that i\xB4m using but i cannot find any kind of table
  with the standard meassures and i\xB4m don\xB4t know, how i should do it. Should
  i just print the text and see if i have too much space in each line between the
  words (as i do) or there is some special rules for that, or for the Garamond type?.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot and excuse me if the question is stupid; it is difficult to find help in spain
  about it."

    sounds like a <em>very</em> good idea to me. Look (and <em>read </em>!), and you\u2019ll
    see.\r\n\r\n<cite>the space between the letter</cite>\r\nDo you mean between the
    words? They should be even, not too tight and not too wide (most often, the latter
    is the problem).\r\n\r\nOr are you talking about the spaces between the letters?
    When working with a good font (that is in this case, a font with well-done spacing
    and kerning), there usually is no need to mess around with that.\r\n\r\n<cite>I\u2019m
    using Garamond</cite>\r\n\r\nWhich one? There are <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=garamond\">thousands</a>!\r\n\r\nF"

  body: "hi, thanks for your fast answer!,\r\n\r\nexcuse me, i was talking about the
    space between words in a line, not betwenn two letters...you are right.\r\ni\xB4m
    working with garamond regular(i dont know exactly which one...sorry) and the question
    was about the tracking; in InDesign i used 25 pt. for the tracking and after two
    prints i\xB4ve noticed that it was toooo much space between two words and that\xB4s
    because i reduced it to 0. But now i\xB4m not sure about it and i ask me if there
    is some special rules about the kerning for text in books, or if the typographer
    has to check the text and decide, how long should be the space.\r\nI mean, it
    sounds maybe stupid, that i don\xB4t know such things but i\xB4ve read in somebook,
    that there is some information about the tracking for each type and i would like
    to know more about it.\r\n\r\nthanks again!!!"

  body: Normally you will use tracking at 0 for text. Places where you might use tracking
    include when using small caps for folios or headings set entirely in true small
    caps, for instance. In display settings you might want to use a small amount of
    negative tracking.

  body: "<cite>Normally you will use tracking at 0 for text.</cite>\r\n\r\nI have
    to disagree with you there. At text sizes Indesign sets type a little uncomfortable
    much of the time, and serif faces usually need five to ten units of tracking to
    get some nice color, whereas serifs need similar amounts of negative tracking.
    If you get really lucky a designer will even suggest tracking values in the specimens/manuals
    for fonts, as Sumner Stone does. Erik Spiekermann <a href=\"http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/2004/03/\">explained
    it in a little more detail a while back</a>."

  body: "<cite>Erik Spiekermann explained it in a little more detail a while back.</cite>\r\n\r\nDo
    you refer to this?\r\n\r\n<cite>Text is usually set too tightly and with too big
    a wordspace. One of the legacies of Quark Xpress. Always set the optimum wordspace
    (under H&J) to 80% or less in unjustified setting. And increase tracking by at
    least 2 units (that\u2019ll be 10 in InDesign) for sizes under 12 pt. If that
    makes the copy run too long, simply decrease the size by 0.1 or 0.2 pt. That actually
    increases space between lines (aka leading) and by giving the type a little more
    room to breathe, makes\r\na more legible even though it\u2019s a little smaller.\r\nDon\u2019t
    open tracking for my new typeface, FF Unit, as i have designed it to be generous
    at small sizes.</cite>\r\n\r\nTo me, the last sentence is the most important one.\r\nUse
    good fonts, and you don\u2019t have to fiddle around (a lot). This totally depends
    on the font, the size, the medium and the application (ES doesn\u2019t explicitly
    name those applications just for the fun of it).\r\nAnd no, FF Unit is not the
    only font that has been made with caution.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this has been
    written in 2004 \u2013 some things have changed since then, fortunately \u2013
    a lot of superb text fonts (i.e. fonts, not typefaces) are quite young (yes, we
    are spoiled OpenType kiddies, aren\u2019t we?).\r\n\r\nHave a look at this sample:\r\nTwo
    [[optical size|optical sizes]] of Garamond Premier Pro, by [[Robert Slimbach]]/Adobe:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gpp_4554.png]\r\nSame
    nominal value, different size and spacing.\r\nTrue, smaller sizes tend to need
    more space. But you don\u2019t necessarily have to manually assign that in your
    application, it could already be in your font(s), too. \r\nThere are no absolute
    rules that fit for <em>all </em> situations. Use your eyes. ;\xB0)"
