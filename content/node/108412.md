  body: Maybe try Brush Script? It's not an exact match, but is pretty close to the
    'Portland' lettering.

  body: "Hi shootzy,\r\n\r\nI don't know if that sign work lettering truly is \"original
    and only for it\", because to me it looks very much like that old classic \"Brush
    Script. It has some minor variations, the lower case \"e\" for example, but other
    than that\u2026\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nDoghouse\r\n\r\nEDIT
    _ Oops! to slow with the reply!"

    body: Thanks for the info. The more of it the better and the more I look at it
      you are right. It looks very close just as if it was modified a bit. I am pretty
      sure Brush Script will be exactly what I need for this job. Appreciate the help
      I get on this board a lot.
