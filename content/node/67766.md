body: "A client has a question about comparing font point size. They would like our
  brand font to equal the same \"size\" as 12pt Times. As an industry standard, which
  of the following do you use to measure a font's point size when trying to compare
  2 fonts?\r\n\r\n   1. ascender to descender\r\n   2. ascender to baseline\r\n   3.
  x-height only\r\n   4. cap height "

  body: "As Nick says, there is no standard, but unless you a dealing with all caps,
    the best apples-to-apples comparison is usually to equalize the x-heights. This
    will generally mean two different point sizes.\r\n\r\nThe other key limitation
    is usually length. If you want to set at the same length as Times, you can set
    a lower case alphabet and adjust the point size to match the length of a Times
    l.c. alphabet.\r\n\r\nBut every variable affects how a font will set, so there's
    no arithmetical way to do it\u2014you have to try variations and use your eyes.
    \r\n\r\nBy the way, Minion was I believe intended to be a competitor to Times
    as far as compactness, so that's one alternative that doesn't look like Times.
    Plantin is also similar, I believe, but looks more like Times, with more robust
    serifs.  \r\n\r\n"

    sure how accurate that would be - you'd need to weight the calculation based on
    letter frequency in your language. Also when exclude caps? \r\n\r\n>By the way,

  body: "If you are looking for a font to replace an existing font that is widely
    used, say the body text font for company communication...\r\n1. I would just look
    at a prospective font side-by-side with Times to see how they look.\r\n2. Be aware
    that with any font change, existing documents may be re-flowed on the page in
    word-processing or page layout programs, even if the fonts are designed to the
    same or close metrics.\r\n3. Read about the appearance of fonts in Windows in
    the recent \"Skolar & Mokka Test\" thread."

  body: ">you'd need to weight the calculation based on letter frequency in your language.\r\n\r\nThat's
    of course correct if you want to be exact. Matthew Carter, when he had the brief
    of meeting a certain length of an existing font, showed how he used an expanded
    alphabet with the number of a's b's etc. repeated according to their percentage
    frequency in English. Then the whole string set in the two faces would be a very
    accurate comparison. \r\n\r\nThat still didn't include the caps, but they are
    less than 5%, I believe. Even in German they are not so much, I understand. \r\n\r\nStill,
    I think just the lc alphabet gives you a pretty good idea, without going to those
    lengths. \r\n\r\nIf you are really going to match, then as you say you have to
    match the metrics of the font to be substituted for. But I assumed that wasn't
    the goal. "

  body: What really matters is <em>why</em> they want it to match the size of Times.
    Do they want the same copy fit, or do they just want something that has a similar
    caps and x-height so that the designs work together within a line of text?

  body: Sorry if my question wasn't clear, but they want us to enlarge our 12pt Garramond
    font so that it visually matches 12pt Times. They are matching up x-heights, we'd
    rather match cap heights to keep things small. Looking for reliable sources for
    a standard way to measure, so we can avoid going bigger.

    I\u2019m consulting on a redesign and exploring different text faces for direct
    comparison (i.e., visually matching), then I\u2019m pretty much using equalized
    x-heights. That\u2019s usually the most significant factor for visual size comparison."
