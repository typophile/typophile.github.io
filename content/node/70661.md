  body: "I think you are asking how to make the caps more harmonious with the lower
    case. \r\n\r\nThat is a complicated question. In the history, in the 15th century,
    scribes for the first time started using together the Roman Imperial Caps and
    the Carolingian minuscule\u2014two different alphabets. And then they harmonized
    them by making the lower case more like the Roman, making serifs more symmetrical,
    and the stems more vertical. When they started cutting type, these tendencies
    became even more pronounced. \r\n\r\nThey are still two different alphabets with
    different structures in most characters. In recent times the tendency has been
    to make the caps smaller and lighter so they are more the same typographic color
    (same gray) with the lower case. How similar they should be made is an open question,
    because caps are used partly in contrast with lower case. \r\n\r\nIf you wanted
    to make them really harmonious, you would just do away with the caps. The Uncial
    style was is similar to lower case, and could be used in place of caps, but is
    not as harmonious as just doing away with caps. But as of now, most designers
    don't really want totally harmonious. "
