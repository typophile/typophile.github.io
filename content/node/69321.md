  magazine. Mag is on the conservative side, nothing wayout, good legibility, but
  I'm tired of looking at Goudy and Goudy Sans.\r\n\r\nI would welcome suggestions
  for a good serif (pref. not Caslon) and a good sans, that would each go with the
  other nicely. I've not had much luck in the inspiration department.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "It's a difficult field to get a handle on, because there are so many typefaces,
    and no one reference guide to help identify them all.\r\nIt would be nice to be
    able to go into a large news agent, or the magazine department of a large bookstore,
    find some magazines with interesting typography, and then sit down with the FontBook
    (published by FSI), and identify the typefaces, thereby developing a knowledge
    and stimulating some inspiration. However, the FontBook, large though it is, is
    far from inclusive. It should be augmented, certainly in the US, with printed
    specimens from the Font Bureau (its hardcover specimen) and H&FJ (frequent specimen
    booklets), foundries which service a great many publications in North America.\r\n\r\nTwo
    of the largest online font retailers, MyFonts.com, and especially FontShop.com,
    can provide font suggestions focused by category and style, showing lots of specimens
    online.\r\n\r\nAnother engagement tactic is to acquire some old magazines (at
    flea markets, second-hand stores and specialty old paper stores, or even online),
    and identify the types used with the aid of Matt McGrew's <em>American Metal Typefaces
    of the Twentieth Century</em> (Oak Knoll), which is damn near comprehensive (only
    missing a few proprietary faces, such as Goudy's (Women's Home) <em>Companion</em>
    of the 1920s.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Goudy, another immersion strategy would be to
    acquire <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Goudys-Type-Designs-Specimens-Typography/dp/0918142059\">Goudy's
    Type Designs</a>, by the man himself, and try and track down digital versions
    of the fonts online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I am currently going through this phase of magazine redesign...well its more
    an art direction of one specific issue. There are so many ideas I want to apply.
    I found writing down ideas and filtering them down to what I want to communicate
    often helps me with which fonts to choose. \r\n\r\nAnother good way is to actually
    lay out fake text with fonts you wish to put together. Print them out and see
    if that helps to refine your choices. I hope the deadlines are not daunting for
    this project. It's a long path but one that is rewarding in the end.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with your search."
