body: "I posted this a while back but couldn't identify the font - any ideas guys?\r\n\r\nThe
  image attached is a partial scan of a 1990s-era Air New Zealand Domestic timetable
  and am trying to identify the font that has been used for the words \"national &
  link\" (in the image attached the L in 'national' has been clipped during the scanning
  process but should appear as the same as the L in 'link').\r\n\r\nInitially I thought
  it was a variant of Times, however there are differences with the characters K and
  &. I would really appreciate the assistance of all in trying to identify this font.
  \r\n\r\nMany thanks"
