  body: I think it&#39;s custom, but I think you could simulate it pretty closely
    with the S from Quay Sans Black &#40;as an example&#41; and the other letters
    from Avant Garde Gothic. I will be back with the simulation soon.

  body: Ok, here is what I came up with. I used a book weight of Avant Garde and thickened
    the stroke. I used the Black weight of Quay Sans and thinned the stroke, and rotated
    the S back a bit &#40;these were the only weights I had&#41;. That was pretty
    close, but in order to make a better match I ultimately had to move the leg of
    the R &#40;after converting it to outlines&#41; and use a triangle to fill in
    the point where the bowl almost touches the stem of the R.  <BR> <BR>So it wasn&#39;t
    as easy as I thought, but then I am not very skilled at outline manipulation of
    letters.  Bottom line, I still think it&#39;s custom lettering, but what I did
    might be a way to re-create it.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66709.gif"

  body: Actually, the smaller type is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/century-gothic/"
    target="_blank">Century Gothic Bold</a>, Monotype&#39;s Avant Garde stand-in.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;Incidentally, has MyFonts dropped their test drive feature? It was
    nice to be able to link directly to a sample of the font in question with the
    actual words from the sample. Oh well. At least you can still control the sample
    images through other means.&#41;

  body: The Test Drive is still there Mark, you just have to go through a couple more
    clicks to get it. You can also set the words you want as the &#39;generic&#39;
    sample text, so every font &amp; weight shows the same words.

  body: Thanks, guys. I sort of knew that FontShop had that feature, but hadn&#39;t
    really investigated it.

  body: I&#39;d like the FontShop test drive better if I could change the point size
    of the sample. Too often I can&#39;t get enough letters at the size they use.

  body: You can change the point size at the font detail level, but you&#39;re <BR>right
    about the search results and package level. I&#39;ll put this on <BR>our list
    for future development. Thanks Mike.
