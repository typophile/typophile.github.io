    Recorde's book The Whetstone of Witte that introduced the term \"zenzizenic\"
    for the eighth power, as well as introducing the equals sign. (It was also the
    first book in English to use the plus and minus signs.)"

    thought the fonts provided by the <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/mactex/\">MacTeX-2012</a>

    I could find nothing appropriate for Dragma, Radix or Cubus; of course, the fraktur
    characters for Zensus and Sursolidum pose no (major) problem."

  body: "Michel,\r\nthanks for that excellent find. I remember I encountered that
    sort of characters once, anywhere \u2026 would have to dig very deeply to unearth
    it.\r\n\r\nAn interesting set of characters.\r\nThe <strong>Sursolidum</strong>
    char. applies just the ordinary <strong>\xDF</strong> (00DF). \r\nApart from that,
    the rest is true original abbreviational characters which are not yet encoded
    (*one exception); because it is no wonder why they are not materialized in any
    available font so far.\r\nDragma \u2013 * is a graphic modificant of lowercase
    <strong>d</strong>, very much like the usual glyphs which have been used for d[enarius],
    Pfennig (20B0). Strong candidate for unification.\r\nRadix \u2013 is basically
    a \u2018<strong>r</strong> rotunda\u2019 (A75B) with a swashy cross-mark attached
    to its leg, similar to the \u2018rum\u2019 abbreviation (A75D).\r\nIn the same
    manner a blackletter <strong>z</strong>  and a <strong>c</strong> have been modified
    to stand in as characters for \u2018Zensus\u2019 and \u2018Cubus\u2019; the rest
    of the listing is just combinations.\r\n\r\n<cite>Summa summarum:</cite> what
    we have here is definitely a proof for three characters still to be encoded (Radix,
    Zensus, Cubus)."

    or even crossing of the loop is not a mandatory feature here. \u2013 Compare the
    special Zensus-sign to the average z in the word \u2026dezens, there you have
    the difference (which, in this case, is meaningful)."
