body: "I am trying to write a script that adds nbspace to a font and sets the proper
  width. I can do that, but autoUnicodes cannot find a value for nbspace. How do I
  assign a specific unicode value to nbspace after I have created it.\r\n\r\nFYI,
  the code I am using is:\r\n\r\n#FLM: Add NBSP and set width\r\n\r\nfrom robofab.world
  import CurrentFont, CurrentGlyph\r\nfrom robofab.interface.all.dialogs import SelectGlyph\r\n\r\nfont
  = CurrentFont()\r\nfont.newGlyph(\"nbspace\")\r\nglyph = font[\"nbspace\"]\r\nglyph.autoUnicodes()\r\n"

  body: Are you putting <code>glyph.update()</code> at the end? You could try naming
    it <code>uni00A0</code>.
