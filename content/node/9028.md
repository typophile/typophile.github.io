  body: Give me a brush and some inks and a nice textured paper stock. Very cool calligraphy.

  body: Looks hand lettered to me. It&#39;s a dubious substitute but you could try
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/charlesborges/sarah-script/">Sarah Script</a>.

  body: Letterhead has a few that are kinda close. Check out Sofia Script and Stanford
    ... could work? Although in this instance nothing is gonna replace the hand.

  body: I can imagine that <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/avalon/avalon/testdrive.html?s=Kimber&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Avalon</a>, with some manipulating, might make a good substitute
    too.

  body: Or how about this, using T-26 &#39;La Figura&#39; and some manipulating, but
    no re-drawing? &#40;I have always liked this font, but find it hard to use for
    much.&#41; <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64516.gif"

  body: Tiffany&#39;s right, it&#39;s no substitute for good calligraphy, but it sure
    is nicer than I can do with my own hand!
