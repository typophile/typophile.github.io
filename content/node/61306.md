body: "When does one use the regular weight vs using a medium weight?\r\n\r\nAre there
  fonts with medium weights but without regular?\r\n\r\nIs one a better choice for
  long text?\r\n\r\nI'm going to be creating a 8-or-so page brochure. If I wanted
  to increase the size of the long text, to give it more of a presence, and look less
  boring, say somewhere between 14-18 pts--is either a better option for that?\r\n\r\nCould
  a medium weight at, I don't know, 14 point, accomplish what I might want a regular
  weight to do at 16? (which is to say, give more of a presence, but still come across
  as a weight meant for text)"

    should choose a medium over a regular or book weigh if the typographic color of
    the medium is more appropriate for the job. \r\n\r\nSome mediums are bolder than
    others. Test the medium you are thinking about using against the regular. Which
    one do you like better? Which one has better color? Use that one!"

  body: James is right. There is no industry standard when it comes to weight names
    (heck, even the order can differ!). It all depends on the type family in question
    and the task at hand.
