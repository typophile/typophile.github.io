    body: "Thank you very much. It does look very close but I saw some slight differences.
      Anyway, I don't have to be exact and I think Helvetica Condensed will do. I
      was recreating this logo and even the owner doesn't know which fonts he used.
      This was originally small so it became pixelated when I enlarged it for \"what
      the font\" (which did not produce good results). Will it help if I post the
      smaller one?\r\n\r\nThank you again! I really appreciate the help :)"

  body: Ryuk, I don't see a diagonal terminal on the top of the "t" on the sample,
    but then again I don't see much detail on the sample at all. That's why I went
    with Helvetica.
