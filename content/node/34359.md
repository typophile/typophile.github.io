    suspect that some notion of \"anticipated audience\" is the right answer. I have
    to go & look up the Unicode index for most characters in Latin A, B, or Extended
    Additional. It is easier to remember the Unicode of the combining diacriticals,
    so as a keyboard user, it would be a plus for me to be able to key the base glyph
    & the Unicode for the diacritic. There are also written forms of languages where
    there are no precomposed Unicode characters (for example, many orthographies for
    Native American languages in a written form, using the Latin Alphabet) -- if you
    want to support those, you need ccmp."

  body: "Nick, maybe, it depends on how they look -- the link shows bad spacing. But
    ccmp, as I understand it, addresses single glyphs, whether in Unicode or not.
    As I see it, there are two uses. The first is simply ease of entering a character,
    so that to enter w + grave, I can enter \"w\" plus \"U+0300\" rather than look
    up the Unicode for \"wgrave\" in Latin Extended Additional. The second use is
    is for glyphs made up which are not in Unicode as a single character, but have
    been made up in the font, such as e+macron+ogonek. If the glyph is in the font
    (& in ccmp), then entering the Unicode string will call the character.\r\n\r\nI
    think it impossible to anticipate all audiences. The latest manuscript we've been
    contacted about involves \"scribal marks\" over letters; the author indicates
    these are not diacriticals. How can a foundry anticipate that sort of thing? Or
    different orthographies for Lakota, Navajo, etc.?"

  body: "<em>impossible to anticipate all audiences</em>\r\n\r\nAfter further exploration
    of Igbo and Yoruba languages, which use subscript accents, it seems that the examples
    on the UN site are not properly Unicoded.\r\n\r\nThe subscript accent is supposed
    to be a short vertical line, not a cross or \"T\" shape.\r\n\r\nThe texts are
    set with the intent of working with negative-width, backspaced accents, but it
    doesn't come out right.\r\n\r\nYoruba is spoken by 20 million people in SW Nigeria,
    uses the latin alphabet, and is an official language use in schools, newspapers,
    etc. \r\n\r\nNot a big font market, but there are many languages that use the
    Latin alphabet, so it should be possible to have a standard or best-practice system
    of applying accents using Unicode. I'm sure people have been wrestling with this
    for years, so perhaps it's really not something for a general-interest independent
    foundry to get invovled with. "

    Miguel Sousa called scholarly publishing a \"specialty market.\" The point I was
    trying to make was after you've put in all the combining diacritics, spacing modifiers,
    etc. etc., some author will come up with something else -- frequently not in Unicode.
    But yes, the approach would work for a lot of material. I suppose it is an oddity,
    but I prefer to make up a glyph to cover the need. We occasionally slip into the
    private use area, though I try like the dickens to avoid it.\r\n\r\nBut to respond

    Not just the write-up in the OT features registry tags, but how people will use
    it.\r\n\r\nAside on Yoruba (included in Pan Nigerian, right?) -- Way back in the
    late 80s I was involved with a book where there was some discussion about the
    mark. It appeared that one group wanted a dot, the other a vertical bar. The compromise
    at the time was a vertical bar, but with the ends rounded-- sort of like a real
    elongated dot. Another book came along more recently (2003 or so), & we asked
    the author, through the publisher, what she wanted. At first, it was that \"rounded-corners
    bar,\" but shorter that the 1980s mark. In proof she changed her mind; don't remember
    which way she went. The point is, you run into this sort of thing."

  body: "Nick, you really don't want to use the kern feature for positioning marks.
    Consider, if you kern a zero-width combining mark to the left to position it over
    a letter, the following letter will follow the mark and collide with the first
    letter. This is why the OTL mark feature exists: to position marks independently
    of kerning.\r\n\r\nRegarding the contents of the ccmp feature:\r\n\r\nThis should
    definitely include any GSUB lookups resulting in precomposed diacritic glyphs
    that are not directly encoded in Unicode. So, for instance\r\n\r\nn candrabindu
    -> ncandrabindu\r\n\r\nwould be included because there is no Unicode codepoint
    for the target diacritic combination. Unless the diacritic is going to be formed
    on-the-fly using mark positioning, then it must be mapped in the ccmp feature.\r\n\r\nWhat
    about diacritic combinations that do have precomposed Unicode encodings? We're
    in a transition period in support of these. Microsoft's Uniscribe and Adobe's
    CS3 apps perform buffered character-level substitutions for such diacritics, presuming
    that they are encoded in the font cmap. So, for instance, is a text string contains\r\n\r\na
    acutecomb\r\n\r\nthe shaping engine will check to see if the font cmap contains
    an appropriate entry for the /aacute/ glyph and, if so, use that.\r\n\r\nSo in
    theory one doesn't need to include composition lookups for such diacritics in
    the ccmp feature. However, there is a risk that your font might encounter a shaping
    engine that does not automatically perform such character level substitutions,
    in which case it may be helpful to have them in the ccmp feature."

    positioning information for applications that can compose base glyphs and diacritic(s)

    upon generating the composite glyph, the diacritic's component is positioned such
    that its anchor point matches the base glyph's anchor point. The \"mark\" feature

    the ccmp feature</em>." i was expecting him to say something about on-the-fly

  body: "Paul, maybe this will offer a glimpse. If your model is direct-entry typesetting,
    there is no absolute need for ccmp, because you can always put the character in
    via the glyph pallet. But let's suppose you have an author preparing a manuscript
    in MS Word, or any other text editor that \"honors\" Unicode. S/he needs a \"e\"
    with a macron above and an ogonek below. Now the typesetter gets the author's
    files and converts them to his/her typesetting program -- in other words, we have
    moved from direct-entry typesetting to typesetting from supplied files.\r\n\r\nThe
    author <cite>could</cite> use a code for these characters, and the typesetter
    search & replace these codes with the correct character, But as long as you stay
    in Word before finally converting the files, a single replacement character would
    have to have a private use Unicode index, or you couldn't later search for it
    (in Word, or any such text editor). If you search & replace with the correct Unicode
    string, the file can be searched without resorting to private use characters.\r\n\r\nOr,
    the author could just type the Unicode string of \"e\" + \"macron\" + ogonek,
    which is unambiguous. Now, if the typesetter has made up the glyph(s) and defined
    the string in the ccmp feature, that string in the manuscript will call the correct
    glyph in the typeset file. Moreover, if the glyph is properly named (it has no
    Unicode number), it can be properly decomposed from a PDF file, in the unlikely
    event this is needed.\r\n\r\nFinally, the character can be kerned, just like any
    other character. I don't know of any limit to the number of characters that can
    be strung together with ccmp -- though Adobe's Type 1 (PDF format) will only work
    for a string of 12  numbers -- i.e., decompose 3 Unicode characters.  I don't
    know if \"mark\" will allow for multiple diacritics. Even if it will, what if
    the different marks need different positions (anchors)? What about kerning, will
    it be blocked? Available for different kerning treatment following another letter
    -- f + e versus f + e + (a marked) grave for example?\r\n\r\nI'd look at all of
    this, and the various text processors before making a decision.\r\n\r\n"
