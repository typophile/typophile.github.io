  1182011 94720 PM_6426.jpg]\r\nI'm a little worried about weight distribution within
  a letter and in relation to other letters, I thought I had the lowercase figured
  out but I keep sensing inconsistencies.\r\nI'm trying to get the best spacing possible
  without any kerning, of course I only realized what a disaster spacing is at the
  moment when I generated the OTF :D \r\n\r\nSo just as a background this evolved
  from sketches of letterforms, I was kinda studying how to build a sans serif rather
  than write it. The closest letters now to the early sketches are a, e and t and
  I hope all the others match them. Also it had a short life as a custom typeface
  for a not-for-profit here in Toronto. It was going to be used in Power Point and
  Word this is why I'm using straight lines whenever possible (I have the impression
  that this gives consistent digital rendering as opposed to subtle curves, but I
  don't know if that's even true) \r\n\r\nSo any feedback on the issues mentioned
  above, please bring it on. But also any suggestions on letter shapes and if there's
  any inconsistency there I'm glad to hear it.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    compared to all the other round letter shapes. The lower \"tail\" on lowercase
    \"g\" is maybe a bit too long. Apart from that it's a good start.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the name \"Global\" it's already taken in a few variations, so you might have
    to rethink?\r\n\r\nNEW GLOBAL\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com/newglobal.html\r\n\r\nBLUE

    to the a. You're right it was a bit too squarish.\r\nTo be honest I looked for
    typefaces with the name Global and didn't find any. Thanks for bringing the issue
    up. I will certainly consider changing the name.\r\n\r\nI will upload a new PDF
    when I finish the numeral 8 and the punctuation."

    for my taste though.  Anyway keep it up!\r\n\r\nCheers"
