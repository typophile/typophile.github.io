  I regretfully haven't developed the ability to really identify too many different

  here are a couple ones that maybe you type-identifying virtuosos can readily detect...\r\n\r\nthanx

  body: Hmmm... that's odd both opened up fine for me in my browser (I'm using Safari
    right now). Anyway, I've already come up with an acceptable substitute for the
    2nd one anyway (though it isn't exact and I'm kinda curious as to what it is).
    The first one would be much more useful for me to figure out...

  body: "Thanks... Blair is pretty close... close enough. Actually, for what I'm doing
    I think that the Helvetica Neue LT Std that I was messing with would have been
    a close enough match, but the Blair is much more elegant (I really like that typeface)
    and I was able to find a free version of it (with a bit of looking).\r\n\r\nAs
    for me JPGs. I double checked and they are indeed RGBs. I can't think of why one
    would display and the other not as they both were generated with the same \"Save
    for Web and Devices\" function in Photoshop with the exact same settings. Not
    that I doubt that they weren't working on someone's browser, but I'm curious as
    to what the reason might be. \r\n"
