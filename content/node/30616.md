  that Gall</a>, as proposed by Matthew Desmond.  I have to say, I can't think of
  any letter shapes that I'm particularly enchanted by, perhaps because I love letters
  that blend with the rest in the font.  Perhaps I should create a third thread about
  great fonts in general, but surely that topic's been exhausted in other threads.
  \ Can anyone link to them?\r\n\r\nAnyway, for this topic, pattyfab suggested the
  ampersand of Caslon Italic.  Quite fab indeed, Patty."

    at TypeCon 2005: \"You don't want beautiful letters, you want beautiful words.\"\r\n\r\nLooking
    at sample words of Catull on MyFonts, the 'a' has 'color' problems, leaving a
    gap in the NE corner compared to the other lc letters. So the Catull a is exquisite,
    but a problem within the font. "

  body: "William,\r\n\r\nYou would have appreciated seeing Catull set from an Alphatype
    machine, with a master font that had 6 different point sizes.\r\n\r\nWhen Berthold
    bought out Alphatype they offered us some of their library - redrawn for the Alphatype.
    I was the only shop in New York City to have Catull. I loved that font. One of
    the publishing houses (I think it was Carol Publishing or Pinnacle or maybe even
    Ballantine) had an author who was producing romance books every few months. (Not
    quite a Barbara Cartland, but direct competition.) I convinced the art director
    to use Catull for the covers. A few years later (and many art directors later)
    I received a call asking what the face was -- and how come Cardinal, Photoletter,
    Haber, etc. didn't have it... it was so nice having an \"exclusive.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    WTF must have one of Adobe's original fonts. There were so many problems with
    their releases. I laugh how folks think \"professional\" fonts are so great --
    even though I own Adobe fonts -- I keep remembering when I first bought the library
    in the late 1980s. They told me I could sell the whole library when I was done
    with it. Nice of them... (I don't know if you remember this, they also gave me
    all the printer fonts on an 80mg hard disk that fit my Compugraphic imagesetter...
    making it just a little bit faster at the time.)"
