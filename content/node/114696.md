    nor is Arial. Univers was always more neutral in my opinion. It still has character,
    but it doesn't have such distinct letters as Helvetica does (a, R, S). I always
    recognize Univers by its /a but I don't think I would recognize it otherwise.
    Folio isn't neutral at all, is it?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't really consider FF Kievit
    to be neutral either, but strangely enough it's almost exactly what comes to mind
    when I think of a \"skeleton\" typeface."

    to you guys neutrality is a \"dry\" grotesque face. At the same time though I
    couldn't really say what's perfectly neutral. I agree with donshottype's comment:
    \"Some similar fonts, such as Myriad have picked up baggage. For many people Myriad
    now says Apple.\" Myriad has always been a face without much of an identity for
    me, but I can see how people become so familiar with a brand that a typeface suddenly
    says a lot more than perhaps it initially intended. For me Helvetica and Arial
    are at least culturally not at all neutral. We recognize both immediately and
    it comes with a lot of historical baggage. Arial is also the default typeface
    of the city I live in so Arial tends to become even less neutral for me.\r\n\r\nBut
    can you guys clarify what you think of when considering neutrality in typefaces?
    hamest mentioned he's looking for a typeface that is \"free from political, social
    and cultural connotations\". I think faces like Helvetica are not that, but perhaps
    an unpopular Helvetica no one is familiar with would be. I don't really understand
    how faces like Helvetica and especially Akzidenz Grotesk pop up here though. What
    I think of when considering \"neutrality\" and \"skeletal\" is a typeface stripped
    down from the essentials. Not a geometric typeface, but a clean grotesque. No
    spurs. As I mentioned Univers is quite neutral to me. I don't find Folio neutral
    at all because of those strange counters. I like it, but it's far from neutral.
    So perhaps you reason neutrality differently?"

    terminals, for instance. My take is that Miedinger was primarily concerned with
    logical consistency and esthetic purity (which may be the same thing), not neutrality

    and has the distinctive thing where bolder cuts have more contrast than most grotesques.

    you can argue that Helvetica has a certain neutrality or clinical look, but that's
    different from the kind of neutrality (skeletal) we're after. Strip Helvetica's
    character down and you have a neutral typeface. Get rid of the vertical leg in

    very different from neutrality, even if averaging techniques may be applied to
    eventually get to a form which may be perceived as neutral. The output of these
    averaging techniques depend on the input and since the input isn't necessarily
    neutral, you can't expect the outcome to be. To get to neutrality you need human
    eyes and rationality. If all typefaces are like circles and true neutrality is
    like a triangle, then by taking the average of all those circles you will never
    get to a triangle. It will give insights into the common ground of typefaces which
    will probably make it easier to create a neutral skeleton because it restricts
    the area it can live in, but the averaging technique is just a tool and is not
    a showcase of neutrality.\r\n\r\nLike froo said: \"With this method, you only

    you're targeting is the remaining 83%. I don't understand how that can be used

    What about it? \r\n_____\r\nbtw,\r\nI did a skeleton alphabet years ago for my
    own teaching purposes. It later became [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/minor-light/|Lapidaria]]."

    Flesichmann revival to date. But what I'm saying cannot in fact be applied to
    any revival; this is a rare case where I believe something valuable has failed
    to be revived. Virtually all revivals are either accurately faithful, or discard
    aspects that were \u2013or have largely become\u2013 pointless. In contrast, I
    think aiming for higher readability is ever-relevant, and this particular opportunity
    has yet to be grasped.\r\n\r\nDid Kaiser play it safe (as I suspect), was he wary
    of reviving an aspect he did not himself sufficiently understand, or did he think
    the deviation in the original was simply a bad idea? That is the interesting question
    \u2013 it reflects not only on an individual designer but on how the market shapes
    culture.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
