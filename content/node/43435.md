  questions are facile or reveal profound ignorance.  (Although, I would rather be
  thought of as stupid and get educated than blithely go about with niggling questions).
  \ \r\n\r\nJust seeing if anyone can lead me to information or give me non-legal
  advice (i.e. general good rule of thumb common sense cya advice) about permissible
  uses of free fonts and freeware images in designs.\r\n\r\nFonts seem more clear
  cut to me because typically when downloaded or purchased, the license gives the
  terms of use (e.g. only non-commercial, or permissible in for profit work, etc.).\r\n\r\nUse
  of freeware images in commercial are less clear to me.  If, say, I download a freeware
  image and run it through Photoshop so that the original image is unrecognizable
  and inspires, say, a logo design, would someone consider this stealing if the image
  terms said it could not be used in a logo?  Would the use of an element of the freeware
  image be considered a use of the image in its entirety?\r\n\r\nWhat if I drew my
  own font or image based on the freeware font or image and then used that as the
  basis for my logo?  Would that be inspiration or stealing?  What do people consider
  the line between stealing another person's creative property and getting inspired
  by another person's work?"

  body: "I think and believe that if you inspire yourself in somebody's work and,
    utilizing only your EYE to drive you hand and create a 'new' version of something
    you SEE, that can not be consider as stealing.\r\nIe.: I love this Picasso but
    I can not have it... So I find a picture of it and draw a grid to help reproducing
    it on canvas; like the street painters that are commonly seen on any european
    capital. The resulting reproduction becomes then a 'study'. That seems to me as
    a legit effort, a exercise. Just don't reproduce the signature, because that would
    be disregarding.\r\n\r\nWhen I have to work in a project for print, I do look
    at all sources of inspiration and, if I like something that is freeware, I just
    make sure that my final artwork don't look like it or anything else.\r\n\r\nOld
    becomes new. If it is a painting, never say you painted it; instead say \"I learned
    it\".\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.\r\n\r\nWarhol made a very
    large replica of the soup can which he did not claim as his own original. Everyone
    on earth knew that ubiquitous Campbells can and accepted Warhols scaled up painting
    as an artistic comment on his place and time. There was no fraudulent intent or
    claim of ownership. Andy was not coming up with a rival soup brand and tricking
    people into thinking it was Campbels.\r\n\r\nRegarding your situation, I would
    say if it feels wrong, it is wrong is a good guide to follow. Having said that,
    a logo is not a font. Plenty of logos have been based on existing fonts. If you
    make another font based on that font and call it your client's corporate typeface,
    then I would say you have ethically crossed the line and should discuss it with
    the original font's designer before you use it. \"If in doubt, check it out\"
    is a good motto. I don't mean with online forums, I mean with whomsoever developed
    the original face. There is also a danger that a freeware font or image was borrowed
    from someone else's work and is itself derivative. You might find the guy who
    made the freeware but he may not have the rights to the original design anyway.
    If I use your example, you may have gotten approval from Warhol (if he ere alive)
    to use an image of his painting in a logo design for a new soup company but you
    would still have to go back to Campbells and get their OK as well.\r\n\r\nContact

  body: Ethically, an ancient test is whether what you are contemplating doing is
    "good in your own eyes, good in the eyes of others." A modern way of putting "the
    eyes of others" is that if an article were written about what you have done, and
    were printed on the front page of the morning paper--or Typophile!--would you
    be comfortable with it or embarrassed?

  body: "@dezcom:\r\nThanks for pointing out the flaw in my logic regarding the Warhol
    reference.\r\n\r\n<strong>To consider this issue in broad strokes, it seems like
    there is a subtle interplay between context and process.  This interplay is then
    subject to moral intuition.  Finally, if any other doubt exists, one needs to
    get permission from the original source.</strong>\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nAndy Warhol's
    context is art gratia artis; his process is the large reproduction of the Campbell's
    soup can image.  No one could reasonably construe his use of the Campbell's soup
    can as a means to derive profit from the use of the image in the same commercial
    context (i.e. Warhol could have made money from selling the art, but he was not
    trying to sell soup).  As a result, moral intuition would lead one to believe
    that Warhol is earnest in his artistic use of the image.\r\n\r\nLet's consider
    this statement in terms of type and logo design.\r\n\r\n(type design)\r\n\r\nDesigners
    Alpha and Beta like Helvetica.  Alpha designs a font for the client that has parallel
    horizontal end strokes.  Other elements of Alpha's font are unique and do not
    resemble Helvetica.  Alpha's process is Alpha's own.  No one would intuit Alpha's
    need to go to Linotype for approval.  Alpha has not crossed the line.\r\n\r\nBeta
    takes Helvetica and changes all the glyphs to have diagonally parallel end strokes.
    \ Beta sells the font to a client as their corporate font.  Beta does not contact
    Linotype for permission to use Helvetica; perhaps Beta knows that the use is questionable?
    \ Beta has crossed the line.\r\n\r\n(logo design)\r\n\r\nDesigners Gamma and Delta
    are developing a logo for a ski resort.  They both like the image of a mountain
    in an Ansel Adams photograph.  Gamma draws the mountain by hand and then develops
    that drawing into a logo.  Gamma's process is Gamma's own.  No one would intuit
    Gamma's need to go to the owner of Ansel Adams's work for approval.  Gamma has
    not crossed the line.\r\n\r\nDelta scans a reproduction of the photograph into
    the computer and using digital methods traces the image of the mountain and uses
    it in a logo design.  While some details are lost, other unique details of Adams's
    image persist, and the proportions of the digital product are spot on to the original.
    \ Delta wonders if this constitutes stealing, but decides that the result is different
    enough not to count.  Delta has crossed the line.\r\n\r\nCaveat: Pangs of guilt
    lead Delta to abandon the first design.  Instead, Delta uses the same process
    of an image of a mountain that is specifically provided as public domain and for
    free use.  Has Delta crossed the line?"

  body: "Delta may not have crossed the line because the actual mountain photographed
    by Adams was an act of nature and it was only captured as a photo by Adams. Adams
    made no claim of creating the mountain, only the image. If Delta drew it with
    his own hand, he may be OK. If he scanned in Adam's image and used it as a photo,
    he has to get permission from Adams. If Delta uses a public domain image as source
    material for his drawing of the mouintain, he is ethically fine in my eyes. He
    has not used a persons face that requires a model release either but that is a
    whole other can of worms.\r\nImages in logos must be so simplified and abstracted
    to work in reduction and imprinting that they cannot retain much original detail
    anyway. Think of the Rock of Gibraltar image used as an insurance logo. The rock
    is an act of nature. I am sure years ago when it was drawn, the designer used
    a photo as a source image to be gin his sketch. Nether the rock or the source
    image are close enough to the logo to make it appear to be unethical behavior
    in my eyes.\r\n\r\nAgain, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    had a similar situation once, I needed the profile of Michelangelo's David for

    an art publisher so I cribbed a photo from one of their books. I converted the
    photo to greyscale, cropped it tight to the face, and manipulated it. Perhaps
    I should have gotten the rights from the photographer, but he would have had a
    hard time telling, in the end, that it was his profile of the David and not one
    of the thousands of other photos that have been taken of that sculpture over the

    What I said was that by only utilizing your senses, like self refraining yourself
    onto actually copying someone's work, printed or digital or whatever, because
    you would not dare staring at yourself at the mirror when shaving... Cause then
    that wouldn't be stealing but lying, to yourself.\r\n\r\nIe.: I have a project
    which requires a actual version of a 1800 label. I go around the web and take
    snap shots using grab of a bunch of freeware picts [you name it, just drift around
    a bit], having in mind that you are looking for a impression. It IS over the web.
    All sorts of things - the gdm thing does not ... cool. After maybe few hours your
    got yourself blinking strangely. You find a label that may feel like it is that.
    Then all this impressions collected your just seat on the sofa and sketch nonsense,
    as if the green become red and yellow become violet. The woman you have seen countless
    times on a billion images visited is of all colors.\r\nIn my case, particularly,
    I am interested only on things that come from or before the nineteen century and
    earlier. So, I am by choice, excluded from the ME collecting impressions that
    are older then 1925.\r\n\r\nA electr\xF3nic study of picasso can be seen all over
    the place on the form of 'gicles' which is execrable!\r\n\r\nAndy Warhol did not
    steal a soup can, he gave life to it, by mechanical means. Each print was unique
    on its imperfection. He too collected pictures! Thus promoting the product, maybe
    in a attempt to obtain some patronship (maybe it didn't work as planned), but
    by then, the object of art become ITSELF.\r\n\r\nFree cut:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nicky_23LINE_6192.gif]\r\n\r\nCan
    you imagine Warhol on the web age?\r\n\r\nps.: sorry the slow response"
