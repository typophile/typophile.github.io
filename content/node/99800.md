  body: "I believe that small case a's, as well as g's, are the letters that have
    the most nuances, details and \"personal touch\" from all characters in a given
    font. The ampersand is beautiful too, but an a is beautiful in its simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe
    new project is a serif font, something I wanted to do long, long time ago."

  body: What was the genesis for your design? What prompted you to start it, and what
    would you like toe end result to be? Do you have a particular context in which
    you intend it to be used?
