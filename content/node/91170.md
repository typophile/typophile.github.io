  book.\r\n\r\nI came across this book by Art \"Mr. Food\" Ginsburg and I couldn't
  help but notice the fonts were both easy to read and had a \"friendly\" feel.\r\n\r\nI've
  attached a scan from his book.  Could someone idenify the body text and heading
  fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTony Harris\r\n\r\n/edit/ I can't upload the image
  file!"

    to go out on a limb and guess you''re looking at <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Food-Cookbook-Art-Ginsburg/dp/0688092586|The
    Mr. Food Cookbook]]</em> and the type you''re asking about is the type on the
    cover, which is Cheltenham in a variety of weights and styles. '
