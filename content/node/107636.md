  body: Pretty hard to tell from the sample provided as some of the fine details are
    obliterated by the screen behind the text. However, at first glance this looks
    similar to some of the Albert Boton typefaces, such as [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/itc_elan_ef/All/All/Bestsellers/2|ITC
    Elan]] (actually designed in 1985) or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/agora-bq/|Agora]]
    (which didn't appear until 1990). I don't think either of these match exactly.
    They both seem to have wider, more geometric forms and more open counters. But
    they might appeal.

    one that\u2019s semi close is Frutiger 55 (Roman). The search continues..."
