  whole lot and am uploading a picture of some of them - mirrored for your convenience.\r\n\r\nOf
  course I want to see them in action. What technique should I use? I do not know
  a print shop that uses wood type and have no press of my own.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you
  can recommend a website?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Woodtype_5917.jpg]"

    rather than the block themselves
