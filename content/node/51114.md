  a tagline to go with his new identity. I have just seen a commercial for a cruise
  operator who uses this tagline (for about 5 years). I ran a search on the USPTO
  and verified this.\r\n\r\nI did not attempt to register his tagline so it is unprotected.\r\nMy
  question is, is this an infringement of a \xAE registered trademark if we are in
  different business' with entirely different objectives? "

    know right now and it is certainly not going to turn into a lawyer issue because
    he does not have the budget for that and there is minimal investment in the tagline
    anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat worries me is if I do more work for him, online, advertising
    and possibly retail, would it be a wise idea to move away from further investment
    in this? "

    manufacturer :)\r\n\r\nIronic but interesting, as this could mean that if you
    operate in entirely different business, there can be two or more identical taglines
    for different business."

    that the nature of the business is sufficiently similar and this is enough to
    establish intent to deceptively connect the two companies by use of the same or
    similar trademark. \r\n\r\nAt least a tagline is more easily changed than a primary
    corporate identity. If the kayak company is served with a cease-and-desist letter,
    it would be easier to cave in and change rather than going through the expense
    of challenging.\r\n\r\n\r\nIANAL-TINTBCALA"

  body: "I just found this on the USPTO:\r\n\r\nIs registration of my mark required?\r\n\r\nNo.
    You can establish rights in a mark based on legitimate use of the mark. However,
    owning a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register provides several
    advantages, e.g.,\r\n\r\n* constructive notice to the public of the registrant's
    claim of ownership of the mark;\r\n* a legal presumption of the registrant's ownership
    of the mark and the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on
    or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the registration; \r\n\r\n*******\r\nSo
    that means the mark is only exclusive when used in connection with the goods/services
    LISTED in the registration.\r\n\r\nSo I guess since he does not sell cruises I'm
    OK"

    "selling cruises". They always try to get you with those generalized definitions.

  body: "The old example is Delta Faucets and Delta Airlines. Easy to tell they are
    in completely different markets and coexist just fine.\r\n\r\nA more recent blurring
    of this is the example of Apple Computers and Apple Records. Traditionally, though
    they battled, it was decided they, indeed were in different markets and could
    coexist.\r\n\r\nAlas, once Jobs opened the iTunes store, things began to blur
    and, ultimately, it was decided they were both in the music industry.\r\n\r\nSo,
    yea, Kayaks aren't cruises. But Kayaks and Cruise Ships are both boats.\r\n\r\nIf
    your client is hoping to sell Kayaks throughout a huge region/marketplace, then
    maybe it makes sense to invest in some IP research and protection up front. But
    if it's just a local market, then it probably makes sense to just continue on
    and then if/when the big lawyers ever come knocking, rename the business then.\r\n\r\nBut,
    as always, IANAL."

    if you did not register, let alone attempt to register then no, it is not a \xAE
    registered trademark. Unless it is a truly unique tagline that no one else would
    have independently come up with, odds are not good in making any claims against
    them."

  body: "Kegier,\r\n\r\nI think you misread my post. I know it's not registered because
    I did not register it! It is a TM though as it is his tagline. I just wanted to
    know if it could co-exist in different areas of business.\r\n\r\nAluminum: I think
    you hit it on the head. We will continue until we have a problem. At which point
    we could always just change the tagline :)\r\n\r\nThanks for all of your help
    guys."
