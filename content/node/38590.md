  doing a proposal for a monument in downtown halifax. A memorial piece for fallen
  peace officers. 17 names have to go on our structure, and am wondering about the
  history of type. What would be an appropriate typeface to be engraved? cartier book?
  trajan? not sure about the application as well. thoughts? much appreciated.\r\n\r\nk\r\n"

    that do this kind of work. Visit and find out what faces they have and recommend.
    It will be the best kind of research you can do.
