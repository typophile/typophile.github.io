body: "Lately I have been getting more and more spam sent to my Typophile e-mail account.
  It is usually addressed to my own username but, sometimes, to typebot(at)typophile.com
  as well. Has anyone else been experiencing this problem? And, is there a way for
  Typophile to block these relentless spammers?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: I'm getting quite a few, also on addresses of fellow Typophiles, but I thought
    it had to do with the fact that I'm a moderator and my e-mail address is somewhat
    more accessible than the average user's.

    on this, or from Joe or Jared, if it's not asking too much.
