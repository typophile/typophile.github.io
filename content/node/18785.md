  live\".  I can go forever on why that is the name, but to make it short..we started
  using the name to evoke a sense of passion or attitude in business.\r\n\r\nI attached
  the original logo which was designed by me more than 5 years ago without any reasoning
  or strategic thinking.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_old.gif]\r\n\r\nWe
  want a logo that make us look like leaders in design and strategy.\r\n\r\nHere are
  a few rough concepts.  I would like to keep posting reviews on this thread and document
  the revision process.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_vivire.gif]\r\n\r\nLet
  me know what you guys think.  Right now we don't have an established preferance
  for colors, types, etc.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nEdgardo"

    about the positioning of the type and cone symbol (what does that represent?),
    a more congenial position might be between the i's, I think you should look at
    other typefaces, although removing the dots from the i's is working I don't think
    removing the accent is necessarily a good idea.\r\nTim"

  body: "Tim,\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply.  I think we will add the accent.  In terms
    of the cone, the designer wante to convey communication and keep a reference to
    the 'v'.  What do you think about the icon on 3? I am leaning to transparecy to
    convey a modern feel.\r\n\r\nEdgardo"

  body: "I dont like transparency much, it was trendy 2 or 3 years ago. \r\nYour name
    vivir\xE9 sounds beautiful and is concisely. Therefore: I dont know if you really
    need an icon!? Try to make a logo just with typography and maybe try to personalise
    the type a bit like you have done it in version 2. \r\n\r\nGreetings: Steven\r\n\r\n(just
    my opinion)\r\n"

    \ We developed a new concept we are happy with, keeping yellow as the main color.\r\n\r\nLet

    more the v's the logo gets more balanced.\r\n\r\nAny comments?.....anyone?\r\n\r\nE.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_changes_6082.jpg]"

  body: "The flat bottom of the e is bothering me, I feel it should start flattening
    out further to the right. I think the wider v's are unbalancing the colour of
    the logo rather than balancing, it starts off light and gets dark as it goes along,
    the notch of the v image is also quite heavy.\r\nTim"
