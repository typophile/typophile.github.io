  body: "Pretty close to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jya/comic-pro-jy/comic-pro-jy/characters.html|Comic
    Pro JY]]. I searched Dafont, T-26 Comicraft and MyFonts, and there were many that
    were similar. I thought this was closest, but I realize it's not exact. Maybe
    someone else knows the exact match, but if not, this might be close enough.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Thank you, I appreciate the help. I think it must be a custom font. But I
    do like the Blambot Pro, it might work.
