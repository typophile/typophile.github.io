body: "I have been trying to make an all-round font for the Osmanya script but have
  never succeeded. I have tried to use different styles such as latin, cyrillic and
  arabic but this did not work. I have even tried to make an original style, but it
  ended up as a failure. I'm trying to find out whether it's me or the difficulty
  of the task.\r\n\r\nHere is the challenge: Can any of you come up with a nice clean
  Osmanya font?\r\n\r\nAttached to this post, there's a pdf file showing you the Osmanya
  Unicode Range.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "1. I think the first thing you should do is gather as many samples of Osmanya
    script as you can.\r\n2. Then you need to try to identify what works and what
    doesn't.\r\n3. Once you have determined the intended use of the typeface (body
    text, I suppose), you should start designing letters (and test them in actual
    words and paragraphs), applying what you learnt at 2."

  body: "What are your opinions on the existing Osmanya fonts?\r\n\r\nOne can't design
    a successful typeface without a deep understanding of the letter forms. Most of
    us can't even read Osmanya, so seeing one example of an Osmanya font as shown
    on the Unicode charts is not nearly enough to give us a proper understanding of
    the forms. Each writing system that has been in use for generations has a certain
    vocabulary of normative forms, most often determined by writing implements and
    materials, be it reed stylus on clay or calligraphy brush on paper. And of course
    many scripts have an existing typographic tradition. All these have to be taken
    into account for a design to be successful for body text.\r\n\r\nBefore you think
    I'm being too negative, suppose you showed someone who has never seen the Latin
    alphabet the Unicode chart featuring the Latin range. With only this to go on,
    would that person be reasonably expected to create a successful Latin text font?\r\n\r\nI
    agree, we should gather as many samples of Osmanya writing as possible\u2014handwritten,
    printed, in a variety of styles\u2014before we start designing anything."

  body: "I have not seen a single good Osmanya typeface, and very little Osmanya writing.\r\n\r\nOne
    approach to designing for such a script, i.e. one that was invented by a specific
    individual rather than historically evolved, is to research its invention and
    development. This gives you insight into the thought processes of the inventor,
    and tends to uncover exemplary forms. This is the approach that my colleague Ross
    Mills took to the design of his Inuktitut and Cherokee typefaces.\r\n\r\nAnother
    approach is to experiment with different writing tools and to keep practising
    making the shapes until you develop a natural feel for their proportions and how
    they can be varied."

    well but does not look very good when enlarged; I have \"file down\" the rough

  body: Osmanya looks it might do better following a Georgian model, while simple
    letters like O are used across scripts, a number of the letters seem to have very
    strong parallels.  Not saying copy it, but it might help provide another jump
    off point

  body: If nobody has noticed, I put the PDF online a very long time ago. When talking
    about the Georgian model, did you mean Khutsuri and Mkhedruli? I have looked Georgian
    up and have come up with those two styles. Now I'm working on a new font (I still
    have not abandoned the other one). The new font is a bit taller and more "italic"
    than my other font.
