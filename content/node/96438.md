  for a complimentary font to use on the business card. \r\n\r\nI want an extremely
  clean, masculine, high design look for a tech company but I'm trying to steer clear
  of the 'tech company' look. I'm actually going for a mid-century engineering/aerospace
  look without getting at all 'themed' but it's a fine line.\r\n\r\nThe fonts that
  are clean enough end up making the whole thing look drab and the fonts that seem
  to have some interest seem to be to much for the logo and take the whole thing away
  from clean. \r\n\r\nAt this point I'm thinking a light sans serif that I can use
  in all caps on a tight grid with A LOT of white space. But I'm open.\r\n\r\nEverything
  I try looks ridiculous. Any thoughts would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nFor an example
  of where I'm heading, I'm also working on a website design right now. It isn't finished,
  I still have a lot of design issues to work out and bugs to fix.  www.p-ns.com \r\n\r\nAlso,
  my client loves Helvetica but I think there must be something better for Sackers
  out there.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nCheryl"

    well at text sizes. Good contrast will be hard to achieve with sans + sans. Go
    with some contrast and good readability at text sizes.\r\nPragmatica Slab? Serifa?
    Or something along those lines?\r\n"

  body: Not to derail the feedback on this thread, but regarding Kriztz; 5$ for logo
    design? With all due respect; ouch my eyes!

  body: ">  5$ for logo design\r\n\r\nThat is a very bad strategy.  What would you
    think if a plumber or accountant or electrician advertised that he worked for
    $5?  You'd assume that he wasn't any good. \r\n\r\nIf you're a beginner trying
    to build your portfolio, a better approach is to do free work for local charities
    and non-profit groups to build your portfolio, and take a part-time job to pay
    the bills. Maybe do freelance design work for a more established designer. After
    you've gained some experience and built up your portfolio, you can start looking
    for paying clients who will pay realistic fees that reflects the time and effort
    you put into your designs."
