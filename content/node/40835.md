  body: That's a firm "no" for delete buttons for the reasons Denis stated so eloquently.
    Makes no sense. Plus there really is no shame in being second best in such a competitive
    area of Typophile. It's here that some of the very best type identifiers in the
    known universe operate.

    devil's advocate: If someone really wants to remove a comment now; they would
    only have to edit it. Deleting the original content and leaving a blank post instead,
    this would also effectively change the time stamp. Leaving only the user name
    and a false date/time of when they last edited their posted content.\r\n\r\nIf
    the ability to edit a comment is offered, why not the ability to delete it also?\r\n\r\nI
    love that I can edit my comments, it comes in handy. Course I don't like that
    it messes up the sequence because of the inadvertent time stamp correction."

  body: "<em>Maybe Eriks could enlighten us?</em>\r\n\r\nYou kid me, right? I have
    about 400 versions of FF Meta on my drive. Check this screengrab. And these are
    only the fonts that were actually produced and are still in distribution- I don't
    keep the old versions around. Some of them are private versions for myself, the
    office or just one-offs. I certainly don't remember all the details without looking
    at a lot of data. There were also quite a few people involved in extending the
    family, making special versions (like Greek or Cyrillic), adding weights, producing
    extra characters for new platforms or languages... Designing type has always been
    a team effort for me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metafonts_3897.gif]"
