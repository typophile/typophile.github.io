body: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nI'm part of a reddit group dedicated to researching for missing/unidentified
  persons. Full story [[http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe|here]], and more specifically
  [[http:/www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/2tzr5l/virgo_tattoo|here]].\r\n\r\n
  I'm reaching out to this forum because the person whose case we're investigating
  now, had a tattoo in his arm with a word written on it that looks unintelligible.
  It looks like latin alphabet, but it seems like everyone has different opinions
  about what's written there.\r\n\r\nHere are the only pictures we have of the tattoos,
  not great quality:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FCD1_5632.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FCD2_6305.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  reads so odd... It seems to me that it might have been a different word before and
  he subsequently tried to cover it up, but who knows, this could have been his tattoo
  since the beginning.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out whether this is a modified
  word or not. If it's not, what does it mean; and if it is, what did it say before
  modifications.\r\n\r\nFor easiness of exposure, let's imagine it says \"Vagon\":\r\n\r\n
  \ - the V is strangely skewed: usually V's are symmetrical: \\/, or otherwise leaning
  right: |/  but this one seems to be the other way around: \\|\r\n  - also, why would
  the left part of the V go so high up, is this normal in any typography?\r\n  - what
  other letter could this have been?\r\n  - the next letter could have originally
  been an \"i\", transformed into an \"a\", plus  a strange squirrel tail to the top
  right...\r\n  -  and crossing the dot of the \"i\" to make it look like it's not
  an i's dot?\r\n  - why is the top and right part of this letter, as well as the
  squirrel tail, thicker than the rest?\r\n  - the \"g\" is s off... the size of the
  (\"counter\"? \"bowl\"?) round part of the letter is tiny compared to the previous
  \"a\", or the subsequent \"o\". Looks like a transformation? \"j\" to \"g\"?\r\n
  \ - if this was a cover up from \"j\" to \"g\" (and the \"squirrel tail\" of the
  \"a\" was covering the dot of a \"j\") then that leaves us with \"ij\" next to each
  other, but then the \"ij\" letters seem to be too spread apart for this.\r\n  -
  the ending \"n\" doesn't really look like an \"n\", more like another strange tail
  for the \"o\", so I'm not sure what to think about this.\r\n\r\nSo, the pics are
  not good quality, and the skewness in the letters could be due to skin condition
  or photographic angle. Also, I'm not in any way an expert in typography, and also
  I have no clue if the tattoos were modified or not. The police report does say they
  the tattoos seemed to be recent. There was apparently also another tattoo where
  \"A globe surrounded by letters on the left forearm. According to the autopsy report
  the letters were 'Illegible and not English'\". The pics for this other tattoo are
  not available.\r\n\r\nAnyone in this forum would like to share their thoughts? "

    tattoo that was poorly done and perhaps misspelled and revised."

  body: Yeah, it says "Virgo". The peculiarities are consistent with an amateur attempt
    to be artistic. A cross for a dot is not unusual in contexts where a simple dot
    would be impractical, particularly to mark it as intentional where other spots
    can occur.
