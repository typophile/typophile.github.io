  complutense\".\r\nI decided to reconsider this font because of the ask of a publishing
  house to design layouts for Bibles.\r\nIt will be available in roman, italic and
  bold with small capitals and oldstyle figures.\r\nAvailable on March 2011 on http://www.editions205.fr\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlcalaSpecimen_6132.jpg]"
