body: "I have read a few posts where people argue for Modern type, which is made for
  use/printing in our time.\r\n\r\nGood argument, but Adobe Garamond is also made
  'for our time' even if it is only Garamond in name as it is a modern OT version
  made for text right?\r\n\r\nFrom a book/novel text point of view, why would it be
  better to use a modern typeface (one designed in the last 15 years) rather than
  a 'remake' that is meant to be good for the same thing (Baskerville Ten, A-Garamond,
  Bembo Book).\r\n\r\nThe 'Classic' book typefaces are in every book I open, so they
  must have lasted for a reason? (ie, they are good for text [as well as being easily
  available]).\r\n\r\nI like to use modern typefaces for modern jobs, but I do  not
  have a solid argument for clients to use typefaces other than the ones they expect.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?\r\n\r\nHofe.\r\n\r\n"

    do, it sounds like a perfect relationship."

  body: 'Since you mention a book/novel text point of view, the issue of readability
    is central. I agree with the idea that we read best what we read most, so many
    of the old classics are still around because they are so widely used, and maybe
    familiar. I would suggest typefaces, whether old or new, if they are appropriate
    to the project, and whether they work best in that situation. '

    issue all my life and, usually, opted for the safe approach, read \u2018old-fashioned\u2019.\r\nBut
    then, my customers would have fired me if they thought I wanted to break some
    new ground, I believe.\r\nThat said, I used Minion and Myriad in many books (textbooks,
    professional), and it was OK.\r\nIf you are fortunate enough to get briefs on

  body: "More about designing type than using type, perhaps, but this excerpt from
    the fanciful tale that Dwiggins tells about the birth of Electra sums up one position:\r\n\r\n<cite>.
    . . . Got in touch with Kobodaishi and had a long talk with him. You will remember
    him as the Patron Saint of the lettering art\u2014great Buddhist missionary in
    old Japan.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ . . . ] He said: \u201CThe trouble
    with all you people is that you are always trying to reproduce Jenson\u2019s letters,
    or John de Spira or some of those Venetian people. You are always going back three
    or four hundred years and trying to do over again what they did then. What\u2019s
    the idea?\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201CWell\u201D I said, \u201Cwe
    think those types were pretty good\u2014about the best that anybody ever made,
    and we\u2019d like to make some like them.\u201D\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    \u201CBut why like them?\u201D he said. \u201CYou don\u2019t live in Venice in
    1500. This is 1935. Why don\u2019t you do what they did: take letter shapes and
    see if you can\u2019t work them into something that stands for 1935? Why doll
    yourself up in Venetian fancy-dress costume and go dodging around in airplanes
    and automobiles dressed up that way?\u201D\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201CI
    know\u201D I said. \u201CBut you can\u2019t play tricks with the shapes of letters.
    If you do, people can\u2019t read \u2019em. People are used to type that looks
    like that, and you have got to keep mighty close to the old designs.\u201D\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    \u201CUsed to the 1500 types? Don\u2019t you believe it. People are used to newspaper
    types, and typewriter types. Your Venice types are just about as queer-looking
    to your friends in Hingham as Greek letters. What people are used to in your time
    .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That\u2019s no argument. [ . . . ] All I\u2019m saying is that
    the personality of Jenson, or Caslon, isn\u2019t the personality you want. You
    want the personality of an individual living in A. D. 1935. Take yourself, for
    instance. You\u2019re a student of letter forms. What would your personality be,
    expressed in a type?\u201D\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    where you would be part of a different audience.\r\n\r\nSuppose there is promising
    new string quartet. They will be giving a series of concerts next year. The success
    of the quartet -- thus their reputation and livelihood -- will to some extent
    depend on critical reviews of the performances, but to an equal or larger extent,
    on the audience response, including  ticket sales.\r\n\r\nYour job is to select
    the program they will (learn and) play. To come up with the program, do you poll
    composers? Even a broad selection, including some older, seasoned composers who
    do have a following, some younger, talented people known only amongst their peers,
    and a few talented students?\r\n\r\nOr if music is too much an art to compare
    to typography, play the same scenario with furniture design and manufacture. Remembering
    that selling the furniture is part of the task. \"Comfort\" has several meanings,
    and with furniture & other artifacts, all have to be satisfied."

  body: "There\u2019s something I\u2019m not getting about H\xF6fe\u2019s initial
    post, about Chris Keegan\u2019s post, and H\xF6fe\u2019s second post.\r\n\r\nI
    do not think I\u2019ve ever heard anyone say that faces such as\r\nArnhem / Mercury
    / Minion lack anything in \u201Creadability\u201D when compared to any classic
    faces or to contemporary re-workings of classics such as the Adobe Garamond /
    Baskerville Ten / Adobe Caslon Pro / Storm Walbaum group.\r\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s
    the way I\u2019ve come to think about that now-famous maxim \u201Cwe read best
    what we read most\u201D: When dealing with text faces, the maxim does not necessarily
    apply to any specific faces or even to any specific cuts of faces. Rather, it
    applies to larger factors at play in the design of types.\r\n\r\nThe designers
    of the \u201Cmodern\u201D faces noted in the first post have not made any significant
    departures from the basic principles inherent in making text faces. They may have
    created new cuts of those faces, but when set well, those \u201Cmodern\u201D faces
    will offer no impediments to persons who have basic reading skills.\r\n\r\nThe
    widespread and successful use of Minion is enough to put to rest any concerns
    about its utility for text settings. I believe that over time we will see the
    same successful use of Arnhem and Mercury.\r\n\r\nFor my taste, Bembo Book is
    only a partial improvement over Bembos that had been perpetrated in all typesetting
    systems since its life as a metal face. I just won\u2019t use any Bembo except
    metal. I rarely use any face based on what we think of as \u201CGaramonds,\" so
    I'm not competent to comment on that. Baskerville Ten I have never used, but it
    sure seems to be a big improvement over ITC or Monotype Baskerville in their most
    current digital incarnations. \r\n\r\nTo follow Charles\u2019 post: In a few days
    I\u2019ll attend the last of 12 concerts of a chamber orchestra festival held
    this month. We\u2019ve heard warhorses, new arrangements of warhorses, little-heard
    pieces from several centuries, and one North American premiere, played by 5 stellar
    chamber orchestras from the USA and Europe. This is like reading 12 books set
    in classics, re-workings of classics, and brand-new, never-before seen types.
    Most of the pieces could safely be said to be analogous to classic types, re-workings
    of classics, and well-crafted \u201Cmodern\u201D types. These went over well with
    almost all audiences. A few 20th-century pieces tested Licko\u2019s maxim about
    familiarity, and a few folks walked out.\r\n\r\nTake a few chances with some brand-new
    faces. Try to educate your clients. All will be well.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n"
