  I've got to work from identifying this font. I figured I'd run it past this community
  to see if anyone here knew what it was called. I have a small YouTube banner that
  it was used on, and I definitely do not have the font in my library. I'd like to
  preserve the appearance for this client but if it comes down to it I will have to
  hand vector it, which I'd really rather not do.\r\n\r\nThank you ahead of time for
  any and all considerations you're able to afford my question!\r\n\r\nCheers!"
