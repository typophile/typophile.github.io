  georgia is apparently well suited for the p.o.d. process, which tends to degrade
  fonts int the way that several generations of xeroxing would, but the look is unappealing,
  perhaps too friendly or childish. constantia is the only other i'm aware of that's
  recommended. any suggestions?\r\n\r\nit will be for a new edition:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Where-Home-Stories-German-Jewish-%C3%89migr%C3%A9/dp/B001BARVF0"

  body: the company is "lightning press" one of the largest POD presses. they are
    a digital press. do you mean exactly what type of digital printing equipment they
    use?

  body: "To date, and in my opinion, presses that use dry ink (toner) do not rival
    offset printing for type quality, esp. when the offset press is running at 2400-3000
    dpi.\r\n\r\nWhile I have no scientific evidence, this is less a matter of resolution
    per se. than a matter of, say, \"nearest neighbor.\" For example, in photography,
    with silver halide images, the propensity of a silver halide crystal to turn metalic
    depends on what it's neighbor does. So, even with the lith systems used in the
    printing industry, \"overexposure\" results in thicker type, rounded serifs, etc.
    etc.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, systems that image a belt which picks up dry
    toner seem to have a large \"nearest neighbor\" factor. So you don't want a heavy
    face to begin with.\r\n\r\nA pretty good test would be any type that looks good
    on your xerographic laser printer, assuming it is a fairly high quality one, stands
    a good chance of looking pretty good on the larger POD systems.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Any well-run POD shop should be willing to run some tests for you. Set the
    same text in a few faces (the kinds of faces Charles mentioned) and have them
    run a test. A shop that won't do this for a potential customer is not worth doing
    business with. Maybe on a white and a natural stock. Lightning is so big, they
    might not want to do the test. There are a lot of good POD shops around.\r\n\r\nFor
    years I saw no good work from Lightning. Their work looked to me as though they
    had cut the letters into the face of a potato, inked it on a rubber-stamp ink
    pad, and mashed it onto the paper. But last week I saw a book printed by them
    that was better. The type, a very plain sans, looks quite good.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Whoa! \r\n\r\n\"...tends to degrade fonts int the way that several generations
    of xeroxing would...\"\r\n\r\nThat makes me bristle. First of all: it's Xeroxing,
    at least if you respect trademarks and want to participate in keeping them protected.\r\n\r\nSecond,
    Please take a page from a well set book. Xerox it \"several\" times. Compare the
    results with the absolute worst you can find from a PoD printer. \r\n\r\nOne of
    the problems with PoD printers is that they get lulled into a do-it-fast stupor;
    shove it in one end and what comes out the other goes to the customer. QA is generally
    superficial (ie, if the signatures are in the correct order and the cover is properly
    oriented, it's a good book). \r\n\r\nWe had a title that was originally printed
    by a superior offset book printer in Canada. There was a need for a quick 2nd,
    short-run printing. We used our PoD printer. I admit that I viewed the results
    through 70-year-old eyes worn out by looking at print products for roughly 4 decades,
    but I was hard pressed to see a difference. I could tell which was which by smell,
    but visual comparison was much, much harder. The book was set in Garamond. I would
    not suggest Bodoni, but its serifs are hard to hold anywhere.\r\n\r\nSpend as
    much time finding a competent PoD printer as you do looking for the correct typeface,
    and you'll do fine.\r\n\r\nAnd, let's remember: lightning print and lightning
    source are two VERY different printing establishments.\r\n\r\nCurt Akin"

  body: "About a year ago, Ken Sabol showed me some samples done by IBT (Integrated
    Book Technologies, Inc) that, as I remember, looked pretty darn good. The images
    were better than the type.\r\n\r\nBut also as I remember, the crossover for cost
    was around 800 copies & down for short-run xerography. Any more & offset was cheaper.
    I dunno if IBT offers print-on-demand services, or just short run. "
