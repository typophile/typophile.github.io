  body: Yves <BR> <BR>Do you know if fontbureau ever allow designers a trial copy
    of a font for a pitch, Intersate is a lot of cash if we buy the font and don&#39;t
    get the job. <BR> <BR>Are there any Typophiles there, who I could appeal to? <BR>

  body: Actually, in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/17372.html?1066918755"
    target="_blank"> this thread</a> I found out someone with a  <BR>legal license
    to the fonts can provide you with test  <BR>settings converted to outlines. For
    a fee, or for free <BR>depending on what the person providing the service  <BR>seems
    fit. <BR> <BR>It <i>IS</i> kinda expensive, isn&#39;t it?

  body: I emailed them, saying how I am  a nice person, and a font designer and if
    they let me have a trial copy we&#39;d either buy it if we got the pitch or wipe
    it if we did not. We&#39;ll see what they say. <BR> <BR>Iam not sure if mentioning
    I run a small foundry myself would help or hinder my request. <BR>

  body: Just as &#34;legit&#34; maybe, but not nearly as well made. <BR> <BR>Neither
    Interstate or Blue Highway is a completely original  <BR>idea. But it&#39;s clear
    from anything more than a quick glance  <BR>that Interstate is the product of
    thousands of hours of labor.

    <BR>I fully endorse Nick&#39;s opinion, BUT I had to use  <BR>Blue Highway once
    for an advertisement of a client  <BR>of ours and I can assure you that both artistically  <BR>and
    technically there&#39;s a world of difference between  <BR>Interstate and Blue
    Highway, just like Stephen said. <BR> <BR>With &#34;cheap knock-off&#34; I actually
    meant: hastily &#40;?&#41;  <BR>produced font with inferior quality character
    designs  <BR>that sets poorly. I&#39;m really sorry I need to sound so  <BR>harsh,

    it&#41; but in the end everyone in the studio &#40;and  <BR>elsewhere&#41; started
    using it indiscriminately, and I got  <BR><i>so fed up</i> with seeing it <i>everywhere</i>.
    Especially because  <BR>it often gets used very badly. I really feel like having  <BR>a
    go at it again in an effort to rehabilitate it for myself. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll see
    if I can post a cover and a spread later today.
