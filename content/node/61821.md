body: "Over at Extensis we've just yesterday shipped an update to Suitcase Fusion
  2 for Mac OS X. The new version 13.2 update is a free update to existing Suitcase
  Fusion 2 customers which adds full Snow Leopard compatibility, including full support
  for TrueType Collection TTC fonts (such as the updated Mac system fonts).\r\n\r\nThere
  are a few other new features, including import/export of font sets, and the auto-activation
  plug-in suite expanded to cover InDesign and Illustrator CS2 (as well as CS3 and
  CS4, of course).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
