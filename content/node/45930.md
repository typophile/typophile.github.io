  we haven't figured out how we can use it correctly on Macs (we don't have any PCs
  so I'm not sure if they have a similar problem).\r\n\r\nBasically, the system seems
  to be handling every style and variation as a separate typeface.  I'm sure there's
  a great reason for this, but since it's the base typeface for all of our corporate
  use, it's really inconvenient to have to change fonts every time we want italics,
  bold, etc.\r\n\r\nIs there some way to merge the text, bold, italic, and bold-italic
  so that the system recognizes them as a single font, and we can then use the formatting
  features of applications such as Word, Pages, Photoshop, etc. to select the style?\r\n\r\nThis
  is getting more frustrating by the minute (I'm working on a large document with
  lots of bold and italics as I write this), so any advice is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Phoenix:\r\n\r\nLet's see if I understand. You've gone to a website populated
    mainly by type designers. These are people whose income comes from selling fonts.
    So, on this forum, you ask if anybody is interested in subverting the process
    whereby they earn their living.\r\n\r\nThat about right, or am I missing something?
    Maybe it is just that Phoenixii like flames?"

  body: "Some fonts are <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33757\">style-linked</a>,
    which means they are built so that consumer-level apps like Office can access
    the bold and italic styles through their basic formatting UI. Many fonts, particularly
    those made for professional designers, are not style-linked. To quote Chester
    of [[Village]]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>> Any family of types with more than 4 styles
    \u2014 Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic \u2014 is poorly served by style-linking.
    If a family has (for example) 7 weights in roman and italic, no style-linking
    arrangement seems terribly comfortable or logical.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAlso read:

    comes with a metric crapton of weights/styles, so it doesn't fit in a traditional
    font family (R, B, I, BI).  \r\n\r\nHowever, it would still be nice if I could
    create a \"Normal\" font family in additional to having all the individual styles/weights,
    so that I'd still have them available, but would also have the \"easy\" version
    for use in basic text docs, etc.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations on software that might
    be able to help me put something like that together?"

    by dismissing users of consumer-level apps. All those type designers who disdain
    pirates, rip-offs, and free fonts because it keeps them from getting just rewards
    for their efforts would also do well to eschew snobbish attempts to exclude non-professionals.
    BTW, it sounds like James is a professional. Or is he and his company not \"professional\"
    enough?\r\n\r\nFWIW, this is how I renamed and style-linked my Freight Text family
    of fonts:\r\n\r\nLight (R, I)\r\nLight SC (R, I)\r\n\r\nBook (R, I B, BI)\r\nBook
    SC (R, I, B, BI)\r\n\r\nMedium/Black (R, I, B, BI)\r\nMedium/Black SC (R, I, B,
    BI)\r\n\r\nInfinitely better (for me) then the original naming.\r\n\r\nMaybe some
    regulars can suggest a program that James can use to do the same on his Mac."

  body: "Basically, I'm with Ren on this one. Style linking is the established norm
    and is what most users expect. Adobe, Microsoft and Apple all style link their
    fonts. In recent years a few foundries and designers have decided to buck the
    trend in the belief that making every font completely independent is better.\r\n\r\nThis
    belief severely limits a user's ability to effectively create \"based-on\" styles
    and change them later, in apps like Word. It also defies the basic conventions
    of the way fonts work on Windows in particular. \r\n\r\nI was surprised to learn
    that Linotype for one makes their fonts both ways! Doing it both ways means that
    the vendor has issued two incompatible sets of fonts, which seems to me like a
    Bad Idea.\r\n\r\nI just did a talk at Typo Berlin on font quality, and I didn't
    include this issue. Then again, I was cutting things to fit the time constraints
    already.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nT"

    should \u201Ceschew snobbish attempts to exclude non-professionals,\u201D that

    the problem with [not] style-linking is that mere mortals have no way of knowing,
