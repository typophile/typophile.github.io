body: "Recently the government of the Canadian province in which I live, Newfoundland
  and Labrador, came out with a new million-dollar branding scheme. The new logo features
  our provincial flower, the pitcher plant, and what I consider to be a debaucherous
  bit of type design which is, I guess, supposed to emulate the pitcher plant. I keep
  picturing the three flowers as space weapons poised to zap the repugnant f into
  oblivion. \r\nWhat does everyone think?\r\n"

    to take that  delicious bite. I'm feeling closer to this logo. I'm doing this
    while I'm speeding along in the back seat of my parents Quebec registered car...I'm
    feeling closer. I see the sign through the streaming red hair of my dolly, who's
    hanging out the window, and it hits me, she's so lucky she doesn't have to wear
    a seat belt. I'm feeling it for sure now. I can see the sign! and I shout in my

    have been working hard to promote Newfoundland and Labrador as a spectacular tourism
    destination, a smart place to invest and do business, and a preferred place to
    live, work and raise a family.  And while we have been very successful, this new
    brand will help further position the province at the forefront of a competitive
    global marketplace.  When people see this brand, they will see a people and place

    will recognize us and know us. It\u2019s a symbol that speaks our language. And
