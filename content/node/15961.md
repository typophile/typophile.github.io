body: "Been doing some housecleaning on my vast collection of images (just rolled
  over the 10,000 mark on my Sony camera), and found these type themed pieces. Now
  to have fun celebrating the inline image display!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo-o.jpg]\r\nNot
  everyone wants an \"O\" on their peghead, but this particular Mr. O did. James did
  this inlay in mother of pearl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo-d.jpg]\r\nMother
  of pearl \"D\" on the workbench before inlaying. This one was drawn by Susan and
  cut by Mike. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_salamon.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo-bear.jpg]\r\nThis
  is a regular request, a cut out slab of mother of pearl (done with a hair-line saw
  blade and small drills), refilled with a mixture of ebony dust and epoxy. Susan
  draws the letters, and James did these inlays. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo-de.jpg]\r\nSusan
  designed this \"DE\" for an inlay on a bass with part of the \"D\" transformed into
  a bass clef. It's especially cool because of the different colors of shell. Mike
  did the inlaying. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_kaynostrings.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_kaybass.jpg]\r\nThis
  one I drew in honor of a good customer's mother. Got some good advice on Typophile
  on this one! Mike did the inlay in mother of pearl."
