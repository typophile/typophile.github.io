body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WSC_logo_usageguideV3-1_3838.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  am working with a new ID for a project, and the logo/headline typeface is specified
  as \"Industrial Heavy\". (The master design doc also uses Frutiger and Fluorine.)
  I am trying to find the proper foundry to purchase the fonts for this project, but
  I cannot seem to locate this particular typeface. All I've managed to find is a
  TTF download site out of Russia, with a footnote that hints to a company called
  SWFTE International (and all inquiries regarding that come up empty.) Can anyone
  shed light on this or tell me what the typeface is?"
