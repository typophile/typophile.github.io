body: "This is a logo for a disco/hiphop/dance type of artist. I'm mainly looking
  for critiques concerning the type but if you have comments on the heart planet,
  I'm open to that as well. I know the heart shape is a little jagged but it'll be
  fixed when I vectorize it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5371.jpg]"

  body: "I don't really get planet from your mark.\r\nAlso the feel of the whole thing
    is to my mind a bit odd for an urban music vibe.\r\n\r\nHaving said that i quite
    like the type in the second version - digital feel but with character.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "I'm seeing \"Vintage Hat Shop\", or a slightly odd arrangement of a bikini
    top & bottom!\r\n\r\nI prefer the second version type, but you might need to rethink
    the red & white. I'm presuming the name is B Love, and I think that works better
    with the b in red, however it gets a bit lost from a distance. Also, if others
    designers are going to be using the logo, for example on a poster with a few different
    artist's logos, they aren't necessarily going to be able to use two colours it
    so it will end up as blove."

  body: I too think the mark is way off. I'm seeing "White chocolate dipped strawberry
    is a great gift idea for the Valentine Day". Between two type options second is
    certainly a better fit for what you described.

  body: "Cpix, can you tell us a bit more about the heart planet idea? Is the top
    of it supposed to be a B? As in BLove? Is there any reason that it is the shape
    it is (pointy on the bottom, asymetrical etc)?\r\n"

    about putting too much emphasis on that B in the second version, even though it
    does seem to fit the idea better."

  body: "Sorry, but my first thought was condoms. Make of that what you will. :-\\\r\nI'm
    getting a three-dimensional \xABpulling an additional layer over [or off] a heart\xBB
    idea (so really, much like Alex's white-chocolate-dipped strawberry! :-). If you're
    shooting for rings (as in Saturn) you might have to make them more distinct.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the type: Have you tried putting at least the \"B\" in caps? It might nicely echo
    the top of the heart.\r\nBTW, are you limited to free fonts in this?"
