    body: I kind of don't think so, as Syntax appears to have an upper case "W" that
      has angled edges at the top. Also, the upper case "S" in the picture I uploaded
      appears to be more squashy and horizontal?

  body: Oh, that's it! It has a quirky upper case "Q" that's pretty eye-catching,
    which appears all through the book as body copy. Thank you, both! Very cool font!

  body: Wish I could post both your names in the "Solved By" field, but Typophile
    won't let me. Will have to chose one of you, so I guess it'll have to be kthomps5
    as he/she appears first in the postings, but really it's a tie!
