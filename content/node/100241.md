    as a 'u' in the same font.\r\n\r\nsealatusserafim - I hope by 'found, you mean
    found at a legitimate site for purchase - because Studio Script isn't a free font."

  body: "Mike, thanks for the effort. But I hope you realize that Aleksandr got his
    ID, hence the font, and hasn't looked back... He <em>might</em> look back at this
    thread the next time he comes around here to ask for an ID, but I would expect
    him to keep quiet, so people keep helping him... Barring an explicit admission
    of piracy (and sadly for some IDers not even then) some people are too eager to
    relish the act of IDing to consider the consequences.\r\n\r\nCase in point:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/user/64412\r\nHe's
    been getting IDs here for over three years, and based on the most recent thread*
    chances are he didn't end up paying for all -perhaps any- of those fonts. But
    of course it's not good to live a paranoid lifestyle, so the answer might not
    be going cold turkey, but at a minimum it <em>is</em> what I've been saying: using
    caution.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/100306\r\n\r\nAlso, there should be
    a way for people who ID fonts to be able to keep track of users who flaunt their
    acts of piracy, and even ones like Aleksandr and FM_Treezy who might not have
    admitted it explicitly, but are way too suspect.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
