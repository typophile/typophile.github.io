  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I work for a small communications company providing phone, internet, and tv service as well as business solutions: T1s, networks and so on. We considering re-branding but coming up with a logo for a company in this industry has become the biggest challenge I think I&rsquo;ve faced. I&rsquo;ve come up with plenty of logos look appealing but if you&rsquo;ve never heard of the company you&rsquo;d have no idea what we do just by looking at any of these logos. They want something that conveys the services in the logo, obviously without mucking it up with illustrations of a phone, computer, and tv.</p>
<p>That said, it is the same case looking at the major communications players, Comcast, Verizon, Sprint, at&amp;t. Their logos have little to do with what they do. A couple of them reference previous logos or campaign trademarks. One thing we definitely don&rsquo;t have is millions of dollars to spend on creating brand awareness like these companies did. Basically I just wanted to throw this out there to see what other people have to say. Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>IMHO, logos are not obliged to tell what the company does. Where is the computer in Apple, or the tv in Sony, or the shoe in Nike? It is more important to tell the public the values you have (quality, service, status, etc.) or, just if necessary, a non-direct reference to the sector you work on (communications).</p>
<p>Having a logo with the image of the product or service you are providing may be a problem: if someday the company grows up and begins to sell something else, you‘ll have a logo outdated — and logos are supposed to live as long as the company does (in an ideal world, I mean).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying and I agree to a certain extent. There are, however, some logos that successfully show their product or service and I&rsquo;m wondering if it can be done with a telecom company. Take zappos for example. Certainly not my favorite logo, but you look at it and instantly you know what they sell. Another example would be the Bahamas logo, its a beautiful interpretation of the islands. Airline logos usually do this too with the inclusion of a plane or wings or a bird. Thanks for any additional input!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Don’t try cramming all those ideas into a logo—you’ll just end up with orbiting balls or swooshes and some stupid brand guide that pretends they mean something. Instead come up with a really solid wordmark, or maybe a simple icon that portrays communication. Then, to bring the rest back in, come up with a tagline and guidelines for using it in relation to the logo as necessary. This way you have a great logo that can stand on its own or you can crank up the volume on the tagline to emphasize the details.</div>
