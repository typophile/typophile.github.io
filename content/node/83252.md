  and feel like a light cut of Optima but not quite the same, this one is a little
  more delicate and refined.\r\n\r\nAny ideas, suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanking you all
  in advance,\r\n\r\nm\r\n"

    Florian even started a thread to collect lists of certain styles that we compiled,
    and I think this general style may have been one. FontShop also has Genre lists
    that might help in looking for this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    although both of you were heavily involved in it's components.  Good work, as
    always.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    just an homage to Florian\u2019s anyway.\u201D :-)\r\nAnd indeed it\u2019s Florian
    who compiled the \u201Cthin stressed sans\u201D list."
