  from the booklets packaged with Deutsche Grammophon's DVD presentation of Robert

  I followed were: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%28sans+squarish%29/fonts/\">fonts
  with a sans+squarish tag at MyFonts</a>,  http://typophile.com/search/node/squared%20sans,
  and a fascinating discussion of The Mystery of Steile Futura http://typophile.com/node/18227.\r\nSo
  what am I missing?\r\nDon"

  body: not able to quickly locate any sample of DG Ring. there is a "freebie" that
    matches your sample but I was a bit afraid to reference it. kinda figured maybe
    it was a ripoff of the above. if you're familiar with the ship Sulu commanded
    you can find it.

  body: "Thanks. Interesting. Horizon is a sans squared bold weight with a somewhat
    similar discordant effect to \"DG Ring\" but is otherwise different.  Particularly
    in Horizon's use of angled cross strokes. \r\nI opened Horizon in Fontlab and
    changed some of the cross stokes to horizontal and the result was pretty similar
    to \"DG Ring.\"\r\nI wonder if the Bitsteam staff designers who created Horizon
    in 1992 also created \"DG Ring\"? Or did the DG designers edit Horizon?\r\nAnyway,
    I wonder if the horizontal cross stroke version has been seen anywhere other than
    DG material, and if there is a name for it.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks!\r\nThat seems to be it.\r\nI share your concern about rip off issues.\r\nDon't
    know how DG acquired rights to whatever they used, or whether \"DG Ring\" was
    this \"freebie\"or something else. But, then again, I know a lot more about the
    design than I did four hours ago.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "BTW, we can't use the \"freebie\" font for anything. I resized it to match
    the scale of  an old t1 version of BT's Horizon and it is an exact point for point
    match except for the horizontal cross strokes. \r\nAgain, defiantone, thanks for
    the top quality investigative work.\r\nDon "

  body: "I guess I'm a little late coming to this party, but I think the font which
    has been used for DG \"The Twilight of the Gods\" is in fact - Excelsior Sans.\r\nGrab
    a copy from here:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/excelsior-sans.font\r\nPlease be aware
    that this font is seriously lacking in the glyph and diacritical department -
    see attached example - no umlaut available, but should be no problem to anyone
    with access to font chopping software.\r\nWarp factor 6, Mr Sulu. Mmm... maybe
    not!\r\nHope this helps anyone else looking for this in future.\r\nCheck sample
    below.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EXCELSIOR_SANS_4120.jpg]"
