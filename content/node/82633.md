  body: Late 1800s, probably American, some of the letterforms suggest Devinne, but
    I haven't been able to locate it--or its original name--in any of my old specimen
    books...

    it's custom. Hmmm ...\r\n\r\nThe hunt continues."

  body: It is Childs.  The uppercase Ms were "mangled" slightly to please the client.  This
    is quite often an issue (for me) with Exhibition title graphics - keeping "true"
    to a typeface that isn't quite dynamic enough when used in a straightforward way.
    And this one had incredibly tight deadlines with little budget - ideally the title
    treatment would have been a custom, hand-lettered "sign" to try and at least reflect
    the golden age, if not the entire stretch of the exhibition, which is from around
    1500 to 1945.
