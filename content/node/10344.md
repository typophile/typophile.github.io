body: Hey all <BR> <BR>I was wondering what you guys and gals use for general metrics/kerning
  checking. <BR> <BR>Several years ago, I used to have several text files that I used
  as &#34;contact&#34; sheets that I&#39;d open and change the font to check out the
  spacing, metrics, kerning, etc. <BR> <BR>What do you guys &#40;and gals&#41; use
  for this -- or what &#34;tricks&#34; do you utilize for checking your metrics? <BR>
  <BR>TIA, <BR>Maury
