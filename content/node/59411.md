body: "I was sketching around this morning and wondered if anyone had ever seen a
  font with a lowercase g that was two-story style but with a disconnected descender,
  like so: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g_6273.png]\r\n\r\nThe image up
  there is something I slapped together in Photoshop, since I can't think of or find
  any fonts that have a similarly styled g. \r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

  body: I saw a g like that a while back, but I cannot for the life of me remember
    what it was and where. So this is a pretty useless comment, but maybe I'll remember
    what it was later. ;)

    disconnected g is a cool idea.\r\n\r\nI was playing around with the pen tool today
    after I made the g I posted, just to see what the disconnected descender would
    look like in a string of text (this was before there were any replies):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g_globe_4626.png]\r\n\r\nNot
    actually a bad stylistic choice, IMO.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"
