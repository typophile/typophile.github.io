  body: Frutiger Black looks like a perfect match to me. <BR> <BR>Eduardo, the &#39;J&#39;
    on Lucinda Sans goes below the baseline &#40;doesn&#39;t in the sample Tom gave&#41;.

  body: I have to agree with Eduardo on this one. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/lucida-sans/bold/testdrive.html?s=HFMJ%c6PS&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Here</a> is a slightly better sample &#40;with the proper AE character&#41;.
    To my eye, all the characters match the sample perfectly except for the long tail
    on the J and the bottom of the bowl of the P is slightly different. Both of these
    changes would be easy to do in a graphics program.
