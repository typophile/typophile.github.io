  new serif. It is supposed to be a modern text face. Besides the whole upper case,
  I still have to do the g, o and w, but could use some input at this stage.\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tosca_4862.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "This is just a very quick response but from the graphic sample my eye immediately
    got stuck on the bottom half of the \"e\"; it feels, forgive me, \"lumpy.\" And
    the terminal on the \"f\" seems a bit harsh. Dots over \"i\" and \"j\" look dark.
    And the arm/leg of the \"k\" are out of whack (the leg looks stunted). Also, the
    second section of \"m\" looks noticably narrower than the first section; that
    is, it looks like an \"n\" with a narrower \"n\" tacked on, rather than one unified
    and balanced glyph.\r\n\r\nOn another note, and this isn't necessarily a negative,
    I get the strangest sensation that the feet of \"h\", \"m\", etc., are actually
    <em>moving</em>. I know, this is crazy, but I swear I can see them stepping to
    the right. It's only those with multiple serifed feet, but they're moving, I swear..."

  body: "Overall, quite worthwhile...keep going...refinements needed, as cited above
    by jason...love the x, love the diamond-ish dots over letters, love the open kiss
    between k components, q excellent. Love the way the a inside loop is sculpted.
    Lower case f is top-heavy, but the idea is good, just needs to be judged more
    carefully, reined in. \r\n\r\nKeep on truckin'...and come back with a full beta
    version...and don't even *think* about releasing without three or more weights
    and italics for each one...do we who help you get a free copy later?? "

  body: "jason,\r\n\r\nI see your points. The e is definetly too bottom heavy, I think
    I overlooked that one before posting... Note that the sections of the m are of
    even width, if you look at the pdf. Its the hinting (or absence of) that make
    the preview look unbalanced.\r\n\r\nI will go back and make some changes. Hey,
    with the remark on moving feet, are you 'under the influence' or so? \r\n\r\n\r\nmondoB,\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the encouragements. I think both of you think the f is top-heavy. I will shave
    it down a bit and see how that comes out.  I will keep truckin' and back soon
    with an update. Sure, you can have a copy later! \r\n\r\nThanks for both of your
    input!"

  body: "I'm still seeing an imbalance in the \"m\" in the PDF; I believe you that
    the two sections are the same width, and that's the problem: they're metrically
    balanced, but not optically. The top serif on the left leg gives that side of
    the glyph more weight, thus it appears more substantial, therefore the right side
    appears less substantial. To compensate the right leg needs to be moved slighly
    further right. This will create a metric imbalance, but the glyph will look optically
    \"correct.\"\r\n\r\nAs for that \"f\", you're right, it's not just the hard stroke
    of the terminal, but the arm itself is hanging out too far. I'm not sure if this
    will help, but I like the strength of the tail on the \"j\"; can you lend the
    \"f\" some of the control found in the \"j\"?\r\n\r\nPart of the reason the \"e\"
    feels chunky at the bottom is that the crossbar might be a tiny bit too light.
    Maybe try adding a tiny bit of weight to that bar.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the \"c\"
    is suffering from the same chunkiness that the \"e\" has.\r\n\r\nGood, strong
    commas. I like that.\r\n\r\nLike mondo I love the \"x\", but I'm tripping up on
    it in the PDF. It's a bit of an attention hog.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the \"t\" could
    be slightly taller?\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm assuming you haven't kerned the font yet, but
    in case you have here's a quick gathering of pairs that look awkward:\r\n\r\nan
    at ay\r\nch\r\nly\r\nme mu my\r\nnt nu\r\npi pt\r\ntl\r\nub\r\nvi\r\nye\r\n\r\n\"fi\"
    & \"ff\" ligs?\r\n\r\nOverall I like the face a lot. I use Fedra a fair bit, and
    you have a nice blending of that and Dolly with maybe some Warnock thrown in.
    There's still work to be done, but you're building something quite nice."

  body: "Jason,\r\n\r\nThanks for those pointers! I attached an updated PDF at the
    top.\r\n\r\nm: I think it should be better balanced now.\r\n\r\nc, e: made them
    less bottom heavy and increased weight of crossbar.\r\n\r\nf: Reduced top weight.
    I tried using the j as f by rotating it, but it doesn't feel 'indulgent' enough.\r\n\r\nt:
    Made it a bit higher.\r\n\r\nx: Reduced weight of cross.\r\n\r\nk: Tweaked arm/leg
    a bit to make it less \r\n\r\n\r\nI added the kening pairs you indicated, but
    I generated the new v2 pdf in Word for now, so I am not sure if they will com

    had a chance to respond more than what I have above, but I'm curious to see how
    things are coming along...

  body: "Nice work. I especially like your 's' and 'a'. I think the 'f' is much better
    in the latest version.\r\nWord does not use any kerning-data at all unless you
    tell it to, however your interpunction needs to be kerned as well, like the 'y'
    followed by a comma.\r\nIt looks to me that the 'e' is a bit thin on the top,
    but I'm not experienced enough to tell if that is really a problem. And it looks
    like the spaces are somewhat large? Especially noticable after a comma.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you can use something like InDesign to make a specimen the next time, so it is
    kerned?\r\n\r\nKeep it up."
