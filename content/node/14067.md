    used in the 50's, but the letters are much more modern in appearance. \r\n\r\nI
    think the \u05D9\u05D5\"\u05D3 is a bit out of place, though. It seems larger
    than it should. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm not so sure about the \u05E2\u05D9\"\u05DF either,
    something about the left stem seems too bold (in appearance, not weight.)\r\n\r\nIf
    I may ask, why do you name it Hagalil? Nothing about it seems Galileean to me. "

    could find a newer version with the Yud and Ayin corrected (among others). For
    the full list of corrected letters please turn to http://www.tapuz.co.il/communa/userCommuna.asp?Communaid=3055
    (in Hebrew).\r\n\r\nAs for the name, like you suggested yourself, the face is
    inspired by types used in the 50's. That made me think of it as being a \"zionistic\"
    type, which led me to the name Atzmaut (\"Independence\", Hebrew). However, this
    name has already been taken (by two different fonts! One from Masterfont and one
    from Yanek Iontef). Thereafter it was only a matter of my own associations, and
    the Galilee was one of the first.\r\n\r\nHow would a Galileean typface look to
    you?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\noribendor"

    still think the Yod is a bit too large: you should make it both shorter and narrower,
    imo.\r\n\r\nTo me, the immediate association of Galileean Hebrew writing is Jewish
    occult -- think of all the Kabbalah masters that used to live there.\r\nI'd imagine
    such font as an ornate, hard to read Ashkenazi letters, like those gracing all
    those new-age books (think Culmus Druglin Italics, or Fontbit's Ashkenazi). \r\n\r\n\r\nShay.\r\n\r\nbtw,
    what is it with mathematicians and typography? "

  body: "As somebody who admittedly doesn't know Hebrew, my only observation is that
    you might want to reconcile the smooth, flary terminals with the abrupt shears
    differently. For example: the ascender of the Lamed seems to need a flare; the
    top-left \"trench\" of the (non-final) Mem should probably be abrupt; and the
    (non-final) Tsadi seems to need a flare, somewhere. And maybe more.\r\n\r\n> what
    is it with mathematicians and typography?\r\n\r\nGood question! And what is it
    with programmers and type design? I think it has to do with type design being
    accomodating of an analytical spirit, while fostering a creative/expressive dimension
    that writing code doesn't.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      it too complex, while I wanted to keep it simple. I think it works fine just
      the way it is. You should bear in mind that it's a modern typeface.\r\n\r\noribendor"
