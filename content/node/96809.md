  portfolio,\r\nI have chosen to use the typeface Austin. I wanted my book to have
  a fashionable feel\r\nto it. I like how it looks as a display and for titles. but
  what do you guys think about it being used for text? The book is mostly graphic
  design with short explanations. I feel like this is a similar situation to using
  Didot for text. The thins don't help for reading."

  body: The first thing that a person should look at is the reputation that the web
    design company has garnered. Some companies have been in business for years but
    lack the competence to render the services professionally. This is why a person
    should not lean too much to the experience but to the reputation. This will help
    elude chances of being exploited. Look at what past clients say about the company.
    This will help in determining whether or not it is the right web site development
    company to go with.

    at font pairing to prospective employers.

  body: ' Scotch looks like it''s closer to ''egyptian/slab'', which doesn''t seem
    to go with something like Austin. But at 10pt or 9pt, most people probably can''t
    tell what kind of serif it is anyway...'

  body: "The Scotch story is rather convoluted.\r\nAt any rate, the Austin type is
    related to the Carter types Miller and Georgia:\r\nhttp://typefoundry.blogspot.ca/2007/02/scotch-roman.html\r\n\r\nReally,
    you could use anything that has an early 19th century provenance, but not Bodoni
    or Didot.\r\nRichard Austin\u2019s types were a reaction to that kind of cool
    neo-classicism, as in his foundry statement:\r\nhttp://typefoundry.blogspot.ca/2007/02/richard-austins-address-to-printers.html\r\n "
