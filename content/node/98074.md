body: I'm currently doing a project at University that requires me to create an exact
  replica of a small object but scaling it up to 10x the original size. I am using
  an old box of wax crayons thats only 33mm x 48mm. There's a picture of the box uploaded
  and if anyone can help with the different fonts it would be really appreciated.
