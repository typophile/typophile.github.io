  does the exact same font in the same size render so totally differently?\r\n\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/1475618/Chrome.jpg\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chrome_3798.jpg]\r\n\r\nBtw,
  should we have a new forum topic called web fonts, css-typography or something similar?"

  body: "I found the problem myself. The top one on my first example is #444 the below
    is #333 and this small change in color should not effect the rendering that much,
    it\u2019s two totally different renderings.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/closeup_5340.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    the italics it\u2019s even more visible:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/closeuptwo_3670.jpg]\r\n\r\nMore
    proof:\r\nLook at a similar issue on Typekit for instance. Same font, same size.
    The middle example, marked red should be less black than the two above, but the
    general visual appearance is the opposite.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/facitweb_6044.png]\r\n\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/1475618/facitweb.png"

  body: "No, certainly not. But that\u2019s a CSS issue. It was the font-size-adjust
    property that did the size change.\r\n\r\nBoth problems are fixed now, but I\u2019m
    still surprised to see such a huge difference depending on what color is used."

  body: "a font-size-adjust setting was included in Font Squirrel's @font-face kit
    demo pages. (It might still be there, I don't know, but I rerouted by my workflow
    around it. It drove me crazy until I found out THAT was the reason for the strange
    font-size rounding I was seeing. And only FF supported it at the time (that might
    still be true) . Not good.\r\n\r\nfont-size-adjust - its lack of universal and
    consistent support is a big problem. Stay away, I say.\r\nBeyond that, I think
    it's one of those properties with a theoretical promise that exceeds it usefulness
    in reality. And idea hatched in Las Vegas one drunken night.\r\n\r\n"
