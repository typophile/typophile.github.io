  design and now we also have typography lessons. i'm supposed to do some kind of
  essay about the topic \"the letter as a sign\". i've been searching but i found
  it pretty hard to find information. does anybody know some reference material or
  has been deeper into that? i would be glad to find some help here.\r\n(and sorry
  if my english happens to be a little screwed up - i'm german)\r\n\r\nthanks alot,\r\nelli"

    being a sign for a sound.\r\n\r\nIn summary, [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/books/alchemy/|I
    wrote some improvisational narrative text while composing copy with a job case
    full of 14 Spartan]] (by hand, with lead sorts) with the objective to empty the
    case, using up every last sort. As the narrative progressed, I ran out of some
    letters and had to use other letters or figures or puncuation (upside-down) as
    the \"signs\" for the sounds in the English language. By the last page, every
    letter represents a different letter, but if you read through the book from the
    beginning, you can actually read it right to the very end. To prove it could be
    done, I asked an eighth grade student to translate the last page for extra credit.
    He brought in the translation the next moring.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the Phoenecians
    to think about...\r\n"

    a very primary level, wouldn't a logotype be an example of a letter as a sign?
    For instance, any of these:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unilever_logo_5931.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adobe_logo_50x50_4695.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obama_190_6645.jpg]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nOr
    even this:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typo_4531.jpg]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nA
    TM for trademark\r\n\r\nAn encirled C for Copyright\r\n\r\nEven $\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nSlightly
    more interesting there is the tradition of using an X to denote the Christ (as
    in X'mas)\r\n.\r\nThere're things also like this, which you may like to look at:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eye-bee-m_3653.jpg]"

  body: "Hi! i'm doing research on a similar subject. On a basic view this is it:
    My interest at the moment is to relate words, and therefore letters, to signs
    as methafors. I'll try to explain it better... letters alone or in the form of
    words do not simply \"exist\", they carry the world in them. A letter can be the
    sign of an infinit number os objects (no metter if they're physical or not), the
    precise context and meaning is a creation, a human creation. The letters are the
    fundamental structure of all mediations.\r\nAs posted above, logos formed with
    one ore more letters are signs, and in a academic level i think this might be
    what your professors are talking about, but anyways you can go further. :P"

  body: "wow so much response!\r\nand everything you write has so much sophistication
    that it is barely understandable for me...\r\n\r\nyes logos consiting of a letter
    fit to that subject (as far as i know it's only about ONE letter, monograms or
    words don't count) i have already found several examples (including the copyright
    and trademark signs). my more severe problem is what defines the letter as a sign
    (or logo), at what point does a letter no longer only represent a phonetic expression
    but inhabits a deeper meaning, some symbolism, something it stands for exept the
    letter, and of course finding literature about that subject.\r\n\r\n"

    there seem to be enough ideas to work on - popular culture, commerce, religion,
    history.\r\n\r\nA simple google search should give you a lot of information on
    each strand. Once you have that, trust your designer's instinct to come up with
    interesting connections.\r\n\r\nIf somebody hands you a source it may not be so
    much fun. "

    (\u2018A\u2019 as in Apotheke) use \u2013 though they\u2019re not connected economically.
    And it\u2019s one of the last vestiges of Fraktur in everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe
    red simplified blackletter \u2018A\u2019 was introduced nationwide in 1936 by
    \u2018Reichsapothekerf\xFChrer\u2019 (Nazi pharmacists\u2019 leader) Albert Schmierer.
    It then still featured the \u2018Man\u2019 rune (the original winning design had
    depicted a white cross) inside the \u2018A\u2019. After WWII \u2013 in 1951 \u2013
    pharmacists agreed to stick to the red \u2018A\u2019, however the rune got replaced
    by a Rod of Asclepius, snaking around a drug bowl (?).\r\n[From  <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotheke#Kennzeichen_der_Apotheke\">de.wikipedia.org</a>]"

    of blackletter!\r\n\r\nYour little note seems to suggest a way forward for Elisa's
    research. Every symbol has an interesting story. When you start putting together
    a number of them, all sorts of similarities and connections emerge. As do surprising
    exceptions to patterns. Soon enough your problem is not one of where to find enough
    information, but rather of how much you can include.   "
