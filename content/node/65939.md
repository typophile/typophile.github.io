  body: "I think you're right about Candida, and unless you see the Q, which is different
    in the E+F version, there is virtually no easily noticed difference in the regular
    face of the versions I know. The [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/candida/|Adobe
    version]] is probably as good as any.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
