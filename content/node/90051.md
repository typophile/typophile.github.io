body: "Hi all, I had a friend come here for help amazed with your speed and accuracy
  and I'm hoping I can get something similar!\r\n\r\nIt looks like a handwritten type
  font that resembles what you would get if you were to write it out with a marker.\r\n\r\nThis
  is where I originally got this picture from http://about.me/GregMcKeown (unfortunately
  low res with limited character examples) and I'm trying to make some collateral
  that fits in with other material in that font.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gregmckeown_1319500346_25.jpg]"
