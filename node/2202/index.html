		<div class="commentbody">Caps at the beginning of sentences have the functionality of marking when once sentence ends, and another begins. In 'chatting' people generally do one or two sentences at a time, so the differentiation is already marked by the exchange, and caps don't help further. But in continuious text like this, they are very functional. You could do away with this use of caps by adding extra space between sentences, but this would not save space, as the Swedish official wanted to.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In capitalizing proper names, you give the readers the signal that if the name is not important to them, they don't have to slow down to read it. So it is functional too.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know whether the noun caps in German are a benefit in German and what their impact on English would be.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to capitalize titles is also currently in flux, and I could see this changing, as it is not really an issue of functionality.    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was interested to read in one of Giampa's links on the 'Bauhaus' thread that they were opposed to caps, as well as serifs.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To a great extent their ideas have been tested over time. Sans serifs have succeeded in titles and display, but not in small solid text. And caps have not been abandoned. I personally think that this is not conservatism, but that the scribes who evolved these conventions - like the lower case letters themselves - were on to what is really functional. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that those who don't use caps in continuous text either don't understand their functionality, or can't be bothered to hit the shift key to help their reader.</div>

Similarly, if a document makes reference to many proper nouns &ndash; people, places or organisations &ndash;  or uses acronyms, it will have a higher frequency of uppercase letters. When I was sampling texts for average English letter frequency, I deliberately ignored uppercase letters, because including them distorted the frequency more than excluding them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I initially thought that it would be essential to sample uppercase letters in German frequency analysis, but I was surprised by just how low the frequency of uppercase letters <!-- raw HTML omitted -->compared to lowercase letters<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is even in German. Sampling the same text in English and German translation &ndash; a Bible text of 30,000+ words, including a lot of proper nouns that bumped up the average uppercase letter count for the English &ndash;, I found that in the German the uppercase letters only accounted for 3.7% of the total alphabetic characters.

		<div class="commentbody">Let's be realistic. If there were no &quot;idiotic ads&quot; in newspapers, there would be NO newspapers, and the same goes for magazines. Publishers don't crank this stuff out because they feel it their duty to keep us informed. It's money. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Certainly we could remove most of the problem of paper waste if the publishers of material on glossy and clay coated paper would desist. I know the world would be a better place for it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In British Columbia it is now a very widespread practice to recycle paper (and all materials like metals and plastics that previously went into land fills). The clay-coated papers, that incidentally create bucks for graphic designers in the form of annual report work etc., dont recycle worth a damn. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Decades ago when I worked on newspapers, there was a shift from 11 pica columns to 10 picas and 9 points. The reason was that they saved about 3/8&quot; in width on every newspaper roll, and that translated to many tons of paper each year. The newspaper carried on skinnying up the columns ever couple of years by three points or so until they dailies were down to 10 pica columns. Eventually they furnished all of the Linotype machines with a more condensed typeface, and in a  smaller size of 9 point rather than the previous 10 point. These apparently minimal measures saved the publisher lots of money in paper because the paper could order narrower rolls. I am certain their concern was with their bottom line rather than leaving a tree for a bobcat to climb. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to say, as other have, that eliminating capital letters seems like an ineffective way to save paper . . . but who knows what if anything is going on in the brain box of any politican? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
