  body: 'I think it&#39;s pretty cool - a nice mix of organic and 21st century. <BR>But
    it seems to be trying too hard in some places. <BR> <BR>Vertical proportions:
    very good. <BR>&#34;e&#34;: too soft. <BR>&#34;f&#34;: too shy. <BR>&#34;i&#34;/&#34;j&#34;
    dots: way too strong. <BR>&#34;k&#34;: out of character. <BR>&#34;t&#34;: out
    of character... heck, <i>no</i> character.  :-/ <BR>&#34;v&#34;/&#34;w&#34;/&#34;x&#34;/&#34;y&#34;/&#34;z&#34;:
    should be less stiff, somehow. <BR>Numerals: nice and rationalist! &#34;3&#34;
    and &#34;5&#34; need polish, &#34;6&#34; is way off, &#34;7&#34; and &#34;9&#34;
    are imbalanced, great &#34;8&#34;, the &#34;4&#34; should get its trapping at
    the very end!  :-&#41; <BR>UC: you got some great glyphs in there, like the &#34;Q&#34;;
    &#34;G&#34; needs help; &#34;M&#34; too much; &#34;S&#34; too dark; &#34;N&#34;,
    same as &#34;4&#34; - trap last! <BR>Spacing: decent, for now. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: 'Overall I agree with Hrant&#39;s comments. <BR>I&#39;d just like to add that:
    <BR>- the bars of &#39;E&#39; and &#39;F&#39; are a bit too high <BR>- Q: keep
    the thickness of the horizontal ending stroke until its end, the optical adjustment
    should be applied to the right-side curve of the bowl; <BR>- the &#39;R&#39; looks
    sad, I&#39;d make its leg straight or subtly curve.'

  body: 'The Q: the tail is too thin and too tapered. I understand that you probably
    did it that way because otherwise the whole glyph would look too dark. And there&#39;s
    another issue, the relationship between the tail and the bowl. <BR> <BR>See my
    small illustration below: <BR>Left: original Q &#40;I quickly traced over it directly
    on screen&#41;. <BR>Middle: tail with increased weight and not-tapered. <BR>Right:
    tail incorporated to the bowl, instead of being a separated element. The weight
    of the bowl was slightly reduced where it meets the tail, for optical compensation.

  body: The righthand &#34;Q&#34; is mud, and the middle &#34;Q&#34; has little character.
    But if you took the middle &#34;Q&#34; and thinned the join with the bowl &#40;effectively
    giving it a flare towards the outside&#41; it might become better than the original.

  body: Juan Pablo, your version has had the interesting modulation removed. It&#39;s
    more conventional, which is good for some things, but certainly less interesting,
    less &#34;progressive&#34;. As for the &#34;i&#34;, I agree it&#39;s generally
    useful for the dot to be lower than the ascenders, but you will note that in the
    original the dot&#39;s curve does not overshoot the line, so it is in fact <i>visually</i>
    lower. This sort of aligned-but-not approach I think is sometimes useful, and
    I&#39;ve done that myself in Patria a little bit &#40;for example where the dot
    of the &#34;i&#34;/&#34;j&#34; aligns -visually- with the caps, but is lower than
    the ascenders&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp
