  graphic design guru passed away last night in London after illness.\r\nAlan Fletcher
  inspired many designers with his work and his lectures. His book 'The art of looking
  sideways' describes his philosophy of good design. \r\n\r\nI have had the great
  fortune of working with him on a project. His clear and direct thoughts on the state
  of design will be greatly missed.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag Ltd"

    a lot from him, as I'm sure you learned from Alan. Those guys are legends. The
    great thing about design is that his work will continue to live on...

  body: That's horrible. One of my favorite designers of all time. Last week I thought
    about writing him to let him know about how inspiring his books are. But now he'll
    never know. What has he been doing these past couple years? Sadly I never got
    to experience anything of his, besides what was in the books. "Beware Wet Paint",
    "100 Maverick postcards" and "The art of looking sideways"- all goldmines of inspiration
    and ingenuity. Truly a sad moment for graphic design.

  body: "Its always sad to hear news like this. I have not had the fortune of working
    with him but he was such a huge inspiration for me at university and still continues
    to be. I think whatever industry you are in you become closer to the people who
    share the same experiences. It may not be a physical friendship but it is a nice
    thought to know that you can understand a little of what they have been through
    to get where they are today. it is an emotional connection that I think we can
    all understand a little.\r\n\r\nAs biddy says, his work will continue to live
    on through his works, books and personal stories that people have shared with
    him. \r\n\r\nMatt "
