  a $ for an icon and I can't match it with any of the fonts installed on the system.
  I also can't find a vector version so I can resize it without messing with the quality.
  Any idea what font it is? I tried the automated apps but couldn't nail it with only
  one character to work with.\r\n\r\n- Sans Serif\r\n- vertical line does not strike
  through the 'S'\r\n- more like rounded corners to the 'S' than a smooth curve\r\n-
  the vertical line 'caps' are offset from one another, if you extended them through
  they wouldn't meet it the middle\r\n\r\nAlso, I only just discovered this site.
  Hopefully I won't have to avail myself of the font id forum too often but I look
  forward to lurking and learning.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n- T\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Glad to help! :-) I was a bit surprised myself that I didn\u2019t have to
    look at the character more than once to recognise it. My first thought upon reading
    your post was: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/thesans_plain_pcps/pc_ps?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=12&sample_text=%24&ft=liga\">TheSans</a>,
    another very popular typeface with a non-continuous line in this character, but
    it couldn\u2019t be that one is this case. "
