  body: "You must be converting from CMYK to RGB (or the other way around -- a bit
    unlikely, with a GIF output target). Check your document color space.\r\n\r\nThe
    darkest possible black is a black hole. RGB values of (0,0,0) come closest on
    a computer screen. The best there is, accept no substitute."
