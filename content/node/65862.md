  obvious questions i may come out with.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to the point, im looking to
  get a tattoo in a few days, and am looking for a few fonts, or fonts similar to
  the ones im looking at.\r\n\r\nThe first of which is this piece, created by Mister
  Cartoon:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cartoonw_6339_6034.jpg]\r\nThe font
  in which the cities are written in would be ideal, i know its custom work, but if
  anybody could point me in the direction of a similar font, that would be brilliant.\r\n\r\nI
  am a big fan of Mister cartoons work, and the lettering in most of his tattoos is
  what im looking for. Any help towards finding the right font for my tattoo would
  be brilliant.\r\n\r\nThanks, Rob"

  body: "Thanks for the link above, there are a few nice fonts on there although not
    quite what i'm looking for.\r\n\r\nI'v noticed alot of tattoos in the U.S.A written
    in a similar font, especially in the L.A area.\r\n\r\nI heard that it was a Hydro74
    font although i cant find it there either.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions ?"

    of existing fonts (Hot Wheels, Autobahn and Armed Muzik are based on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/sloop/|Sloop]];
    Mighty Muggs looks like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/charlesborges/sarah-script/|Sarah
