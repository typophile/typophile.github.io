  body: "In my web search, I found [[http://www.360east.com/?p=30|Ahmad]], which may
    be just what you're looking for. Baseet and Jumeirah by [[http://lebrecord.com/?p=940|Pascal
    Zoghbi]] may also be good choices.\r\n\r\nOf course, if I were trying simply to
    match all three languages, I'd probably start with the hardest one to deal with.
    Given that traditional Arabic faces tend to have a calligraphic appearance, I'd
    try to match David (as the Hebrew face) and Verona or something like that as the
    Latin face."
