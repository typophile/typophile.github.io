  font on this shirt. I know it looks a lot like 'Forte' but obviously it isn't. I'd
  be grateful if some of you typo masters could give me a hint...\r\n\r\nThanks in

  body: ^^ Well I appreciate that identification. I doubt that there are any better
    samples but I will look thru my 1000+ pix of him... ;) Ho only wore it on one
    particular show and the shirt became kind of cult.
