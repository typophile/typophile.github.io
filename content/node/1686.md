  body: 'Is the UK part of Europe? <BR> <BR>I agree, from my limited and largely anecdotal
    knowledge, that the situation in European universities and colleges is not so
    dire as it is over here, but there was a period of creeping American influence
    at least in UK universities, although this may have abated. It seems to me to
    be a cultural issue: not so much the ideas but the implementation of ideas within
    a particular framework. Matha noted in the previous discussion that the French
    educational system was quite conservative, despite having produced so many radical
    thinkers. This is a cultural difference between French and American academia,
    and indicates why the same radical ideas might have a different impact in different
    countries.'

  body: <i>Is the UK part of Europe?</i> <BR> <BR>Everyone apart from the UK government
    seems to think so. I&#39;ve come across a few strange research projects in the
    UK but nothing too scary. <BR> <BR><i>the same radical ideas might have a different
    impact in different countries.</i> <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on
    the head, John. I would go further and suggest that there is a lack of proportion
    and definitely not enough scepticism in the American handling of French philosophy.
    Baudrillard, for example, is considered a bit of a nut by a lot of French scholars.
    <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m half-way through Eco&#39;s book on the search for the perfect
    language and the way he describes it, European Academia has been absorbing all
    sorts of craziness for centuries. America doesn&#39;t have enough experience yet,
    maybe. <BR> <BR>M.

    pontificating about America - and I include John Hudson here - often miss large
    parts of the picture.  <BR> <BR>It is perfectly true that the American mass entertainment
    media pander to the lowest instincts of people, including flattering the average
    consumer by assuring them that everone more intelligent or learned is contemptible
    in some way or other.  <BR> <BR>But they sometimes also rise above such pandering
    and do wonderful stuff. And, more important, America is not to be identified with
    the American mass media.  <BR> <BR>Many parents and teachers are constantly waging
    intellectual battle against the debased tone of the mass entertainment media.
    And there are huge communities of thoughtful people that totally ignore such drivel.

    <BR>Judging America only by the mass media is like those people outside the US
    50 years ago who used to think that we were full of cowboys, Indians, and rich
    people in mansions - because that is who was in the movies.  <BR> <BR>Of course
    there is anti-intellectualism here, and it is a despicable American tradition.  <BR>
    <BR>A pretty accurate assessment was given by Alistair Cook, who observed the
    US through British eyes for most of the last century. He said that in the US there
    was a constant struggle between forces that were powerfully creating a better
    society, and forces that were causing the decay of civilization. The last time
    I heard him on TV &#40;5 or more years ago&#41; he thought that the forces of
    decay might be getting the upper hand. <BR> <BR>I think it is a pretty near thing.   '

    As I understand it - and you doubtless know more here - the linguists didn&#39;t
    find him particularly innovative in so far as he got on their territory.  <BR>
    <BR>The authors of &#39;Wittgenstein&#39;s Poker&#39; in my view did a great disservice

    couldn&#39;t be right. Incidentally, I think the two authors probably disagree

    like Bloomfield and Sapir. Transformational synatx and generative semantics didn&#39;t
    really come about until the 1950s - and that&#39;s more or less the [general]
