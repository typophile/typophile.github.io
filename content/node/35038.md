body: " I have downloaded demo version of FontLab Studio 5. I got one font called
  Friz Quadrata TT. I thought finding each glyph pixel width would be something very
  easy to do but I was wrong. I did some research before posting here. I found out
  there is something called Em-Square what is measured in FUnits, 1 pixel equals to
  256 FUnits. Formula looks like this:\r\nSize in pixels = (Size in FUnits * Point
  Size * Target DPI) / (72 * FUnits per Em-Square)\r\n\r\n I got that info all from
  tutorial on:\r\nhttp://www.iamcal.com/misc/fonts/pixfonttut/part1.php\r\n When I
  open Font in FontLab Studio 5 and check random glyph metrics (Properties) I see
  there many values, they look similar to tutorial values. But I' m not sure exactly
  does small icon what looks like this |<- ->| and has for that particular glyph value
  767 means FUnits ? I could do 767/ 256 ~ 3 (pixels). Does it sound logical to you
  ?\r\n I would like to know what I have to look and how to get actual pixel width
  of glyph ? I' m beginner myself and don' t know where to start."

    it won't render sharply on screen)."

  body: "The UPM size always corresponds to the pixel size on screen, and the pixel
    size corresponds to the point size at 72 dpi. (At other dpis you need to divide
    the dpi by 72 to get from point size to pixel size). \r\n\r\nFor example, if a
    font is rendered at 20 pt with 72 dpi, then the UPM size is scaled to 20 pixels.
    If the font has the UPM size of 1000 units, then each pixel is 50 units large.

    width in unrounded high resolution units.\r\n2. the resolution of the output device.\r\n3.
    the point size of the output font and any other scaling that might be applied
    to it.\r\n4. the presence or absence of hints and how they are interpreted.\r\n5.
    the layout method used by the application composing the glyph.\r\n6. the rendering
    used to draw the glyph....\r\n\r\nTo determine the pixel width of characters in
    certain cases, or if your pixel widths remain constant for more than four hours,
    consult your physician immediately.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for so detailed feedback. I looked first what all these abbreviation
    meant. I found most of them but what means UPM and PPEM (Pixels Per EM, what means
    EM ?)? The font is used in PC game called Warcraft III - The Frozen Throne. Lets
    say all things are default (That Windows default dpi, resolution 1024 x 768 ),
    I assume they use pt to show letters.\r\n Can I measure something from Font pack
    what I have? Should I upload somewhere that font so someone could look at it?
    In game they use fixed points (size) to display text. Link to that font is here:
    http://rapidshare.com/files/43276182/FRIZQT__.TTF.html\r\nI don' t know nothing
    about font making, but what info I could get from that font with FontLab Studio
    5 and how ? I don' t know how to use FontLab either so is there any tutorials
    what would explain things ?\r\n I still try to find out each glyph (letter) pixel
    width. What is formula for different monitors then ?\r\n Picture of this text
    being displayed in that font style:\r\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/3594/convertphoenixdamagepicar4.jpg\r\n
    I want to measure for example similar text. That screen shot was taken with my
    PC, game resolution was 800 x 600. Windows XP default dpi. I mean text in middle
    left side  of picture with text \"DamagedUnit has Phoenix Buff\" and others what
    appear below. "
