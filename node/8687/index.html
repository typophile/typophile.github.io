<div class=commentbody>Yves, a trend here is to emphsise the author. You have seemed to bury the authors name. Authors like Tom Clancy sell books no matter how poor the content. Also used in term of sales is (Author Name author of name of book).</div>

<div class=commentbody>As an alternative to asterisks maybe you could use her wink with the 'YOU' on the line underneath (so it doesn't interfere with the other eye) like: <br>F&lt;space>K <br>YOU <br>This will probably work better with a different crop of the image. <br>I'm not convinced by the aligning on the italic vertical (if that makes any sense) maybe move the name and subtitle to the right to align more with the asterisk than the right of the F. <br>Tim</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves here is an example of what I commented on. The second most important visual element is the authors name. Note the creditability line under the authors name. One other thought why don't you have a quote from a reviewer of either the book or her performace.<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63263.jpg alt="Book cover"></div>

<div class=commentbody>A few thoughts. I'm late to join this thread, but when I did peek <br>in the first day that you, Yves, posted I immediately read it as a <br>book cover. The title reads as humorous to me because of the <br>expression on the face of the actress. <br> <br>How is the Author's name buried? Isn't that the first name at the <br>top? Is she a famous actress? Will her name be the bigger draw <br>at the local bookstore over the title? Or is her face so <br>recognizable that you don't really need to make her name the <br>main focus? <br> <br>If she is a famous actress, it might be nice to have some line <br>about "from the award winning movie yada yada yada". But I <br>would put it on the back of the book toward the top or on the <br>front at the bottom. Too bad though. I like the simplicity of the <br>cover.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Yves, <br> <br>I like your irony,, but something about the photograph isn't QUITE achieving it yet. Her "wink" seems kind of unnatural to me. She looks like she is squinting with one eye, the other eye is WIDE open, and her smile is very posed. I know what you are trying to achieve, but the photo makes her look kind of crazy to me. <br> <br>I'm not sure if you shot the photo yourself, or how you got it, but if it is possible, it might be nice to get a few more photos with very subtle variations of her facial expressions, as well as different angles. That way you'll find one that works.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I disagree with Dan and Sarah. This isn't a geeky Photoshop how-to book, it's obviously <br>something much edgier. A menopause monologue apparently. This might be slightly <br>sexist / misogynistic of me, but crazy works in this case. Think of the menopause <br>stereotypes and most of the words that come to mind will be synonyms of crazy. <br> <br>The type treatment works with all of that. It's a little off, a little wild, a little crazy but not <br>Charles Manson crazy. And the author's name is a good size. Being reversed out <br>increases the visibility. I get severely annoyed when I see books with no apparent title, <br>but the author's name is so huge it barely fits on the cover. It just seems egotistical to me. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>And for the record, you Europeans started the whole sensitivity thing. ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>You know what I'm going to say, right? Being seen over the rest of the clutter can be as simple as not having any clutter. <br>Contrast works as well, if not better, than out doing the doers. Letting the design speak for itself, and say what it <br>needs to say, rather than trying to say something similar to what other book covers are saying, is probably more effective <br>than a rave review by a "reviewer" who may or may not be trustworthy. Maybe this is cynical, but does anyone trust those <br>quotes any more? Did any one ever? The cover in question would not be well served with additional elements on it. The title, <br>the colors, and the image are enough to poke you in the eye as is. TMI isn'tjust an acronym for teenage girls. I'm sure this <br>is nothing new to you or anyone else that reads this. <br> <br> <br> <br>Sorry about the bad rag. I'm just trying to prevent horizontal scroll.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, it's good. I think it suits the apparent subject matter pretty well. <br> <br>I disagree with the opinion that there should be more content on the cover. Assuming that this book is for a European market, I it is well suited to the bookshelves in our shops. <br> <br>I can imagine something looking like this positioned in popular non-fiction. <br> <br>The alignment of the white text is obviously off, but then because all the text is italicised, it kind of works. <br> <br>I do hope that the original photograph is better quality, though.</div>
