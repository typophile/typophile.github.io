  of the Year 2000 from <em>The Ladies Home Journal</em> of December 1900.</a>\r\n\r\nPrediction
  #16: There will be No C, X or Q in our every-day alphabet. They will be abandoned
  because unnecessary. Spelling by sound will have been adopted, first by the newspapers.
  English will be a language of condensed words expressing condensed ideas, and will
  be more extensively spoken than any other. Russian will rank second."
