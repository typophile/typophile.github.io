  used AutoCad with its built in stroke fonts, which are made of single stroke, no
  fill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "If you just need a few words, you could easily convert some text in illustrator
    (or autocad, for all I know) to outlines, and set a stroke weight. Most typefaces
    aren't designed to do so though, and will probably result in a less than optimal
    effect.\r\n\r\nHave a look at these: \r\n\r\n\u2022 <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.fonts.ru/ustore/fonts/Gothic-Outline-Title.htm\">Gothic

  body: "I understand exactly why you need these. The width of the stroke will be
    determined by the size of the router bit in your engraving machine, and you just
    need a centerline to guide it. PostScript Type 3 fonts allowed for stroked designs.
    You might happen upon some in very old font packages (earlier than c. 1990), but
    Type 3 fonts are rare, and stroked ones even more so.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that
    Type 3 can even be produced by currently available font design software, as this
    and the ability to include color were the only advantages the format offered once
    Type 1 was made publicly accessible. "

  body: "Yes you are right about type 3. As to designing stroked fonts from scratch,
    Fontographer 4.7.3 can still generate Type 3 fonts but I doubt any engraving tool
    out there can \"understand\" Type 3 fonts. Should I forget about designing stroked
    fonts?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDH"

  body: Before ruling out what you can make, what languages exactly <em>can</em> your
    engraving machine understand? There must be some resource about this out there
    somewhere... Do you have any specs for your machine, such as manufacturer and
    model number?
