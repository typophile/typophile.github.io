body: Would anyone know which font that is? I thought of Futura first, but the centre
  bars of the E and F and particularly the R sit lower in this sample. The top part
  of the R seems very heavy and the centre bar sits even lower than with the E and
  F. Doesn't seem to be Neuzeit Grotesk either. And then there's the apostrophe which
  doesn't seem to fit at all. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

  body: Thank you! I don't think it's SofiaPro though, but I had a further look on
    Avant Garde from several publishers, and it turns out that Adobe has the charakteristic
    upper case "R" in all styles, which doesn't fit the sample, while ITC has a slightly
    different upper case "R" when it comes to demi-bold and bold - et voila! That's
    it! ITC Avant Garde Gothic Demibold either from ITC or Para Type, but not from
    Adobe.
