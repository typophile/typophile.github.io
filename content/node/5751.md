  body: Nick, Hrant, Thomas and Gerald all in the same place. It&#39;s one  <BR>big
    happy love fest. I sat by Nick during the entertaining, but  <BR>tediously long
    Linotype awards &#40;seven honorable mentions for  <BR>crying out loud&#41;. You&#39;ll
    be glad to know that Nick speaks his  <BR>mind in person as much as he does online.
    &#40;Kudos Nick for  <BR>being true to your brand. =&#41; Jared and I are deejaying
    the  <BR>Saturday night party. I can&#39;t wait to see Nick kick it to some  <BR>house
    jams. <BR> <BR>I took the Ultrafonts class, Designing Type for Mobile Devices.
    It  <BR>was co-hosted by Ultrafonts cohort, Hrant. I had no idea he was  <BR>working
    with Ultrafonts, but it&#39;s not at all surprising. Their  <BR>presentation was
    great, very hands on. I&#39;ve never met Hrant in  <BR>person. He was as helpful
    as he usually is in the critique forum. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having a great, great
    time. For me, TypeCon is as much about <BR>people as it is about type and that&#39;s
    the way it should be. It was  <BR>great to finally connect a face with Randy Jones
    and to see Grant  <BR>Hutchinson and his classic Chuck Taylors. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    the <a href="" target="_blank">Linotype awards</a>. There were a couple scripts
    <BR>that are really great. But the one that blew me away was not  <BR>type, but
    symbols. The husband and wife collaboration of Karin  <BR>and Peter Huschka, he
    an advertising art director and she a  <BR>textile designer yielded <a href=""
    target="_blank">Picture Yourself</a> with some truly <BR>great forms that are
    interchangable, meant to be layered and  <BR>formed into patterns. The black and
    white samples don&#39;t do it  <BR>justice. Imagine it in bamboo and celery greens,
    layered and  <BR>overlayed. Great. <BR> <BR>A word about Interrobang. It&#39;s
    much improved over last year&#39;s.  <BR>Nice job Stewf. &#40;Proof that paper
    matters!&#41;

  body: Yeah, those Linotype contest typefaces are wicked, aren&#39;t they? I can&#39;t
    get over that Pirouette &#40;<a href="http://www.linotype.com/91918/pirouette-family.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/91918/pirouette-family.html</a>&#41; is
    Tatento&#39;s first typeface. <BR> <BR>I wish that I were at TypeCon, too. <BR>
    <BR>Even cooler than Pirouette and Picture Yourself, in my opinion, was Linotype&#39;s
    decision to fly the winners themselves &#40;unfortunately, not all of the winners
    were able to attend&#41; to SF, and put them up during the TypeCon week. It makes
    me kick myself for not having entered the ITDC 2003 contest myself &#40;not that
    I have any designs that would have won anything...&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;Joe, your

    and the response has been fantastic. I only wish I could have stuffed more of
    them in to my luggage to share with the TypeCon crowd down here. If anyone who
    was at TypeCon wasn&#39;t able to pick one up of these catalogues, send me an
    email and I&#39;ll see what I can do for you apr

  body: 'For better or worse, for me meatspace is much more docile than online fora.
    I got along with almost everybody - credit to <i>them</i> mostly. It was a really
    great conference - quite possibly the best ever I&#39;ve been to - although it&#39;ll
    take weeks to see it objectively - as with anything so heady. It was great to
    be back. Special thanks to Tamye. <BR> <BR>BTW, Miles, TC98 was special, wasn&#39;t
    it&#42;. The giddy &#34;exploring the unknown&#34; delight is gone now, but in
    terms of value and pure rockin&#39; fun 2004 rules bigtime, and apparently it
    gets better every year. Helsinki or New York... Now that&#39;s an open question.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; And talking to Stuart it&#39;s clear that feeling is pervasive
    - something magical happened back then. And maybe it was my imagination, but whenever
    two of us from the Old School &#40;like Brian, Allen, Richard, James, Simon&#41;
    eyed each other in SF we had this certain knowing, quiet smile. Bob was there
    too. But I guess this conference will generate its own nostalgia as well. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, thanks to Jared and Joe &#40;duh&#41;, Typophile was like a subcurrent
    running through the entire conference: most blind intros referenced this place,
    even particular threads! Major symbiosis. Or mutual parasitism.  ;-&#41; <BR>

    is &#34;old&#34;... I missed all the conferences between the first and this one
    - so I&#39;m actually pretty fringe. Other people have been toiling away throughout
    these years, building it up to the success it is now. Respect. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant, I felt similarly about last year&#39;s conference which was my first.
    Maybe the first TypeCon--whichever one it was--will always have a special quality
    that can&#39;t be repeated. <BR> <BR>As far as meatspace vs. online goes, when
    you talk to someone in person, you have much less opportunity to be misunderstood
    because you not only get the words, you also get body language, facial expression,
    tone of voice, etc., and it&#39;s much harder to forget another person&#39;s humanity
    when they&#39;re standing right in front of you. <BR> <BR>I think a good portion
    of what passes as debate online simply comes down to the difficulty of communicating
    through such a limited medium as text. They touched on this a bit in the Underware
    Typeradio presentation.

    that I&#39;m doing the right thing with going back to school to study type. The
    best part was meeting so many people -- now I can hear your voices narrating when

    but nobody seemed to care. There I was having lunch with Mark Simonson or playing
    hearts with Steven Coles or signing Dave Farey&#39;s programme... just a bunch
    of font-geeks hanging out and talking about their passion without having to explain
    that, yes, someone actually has to design all those little letters they read every
    day. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t miss two years in a row. See you in 2005.
