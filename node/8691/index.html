I assume they were once used for signage of some sort, though I haven&#39;t seen anything like them and am quite curious as to their origin. The box is quite old, made of wood and has absolutely no identifiable markings. <BR> <BR>They are made of a very thin metal, &#40;about one inch in height&#41; perhaps aluminum or something similar and are hand painted orange and white. It contains the full alphabet with numerals and punctuation. On the right side of the box &#40;see photos&#41; there is a small metal board with what resembles lead em spaces, though made of a lightweight magnetic material. <BR> <BR>Has anyone seen a set like this? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/63129.jpg" alt=""> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/63130.jpg" alt=""> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/63131.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps this is a precursor to the black signs with white plastic letters that you see in corporate lobbies, usually with messages like &#34;Acme Corp. welcomes Zara Evens.&#34; <BR> <BR>The magnets would go on the back of black metal board to hold the letters in place. The whole thing would then slide into some kind of display stand, or rest on an easel.  <BR> <BR>Just a guess, though. Very cool find!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It looks like the A and 4 are reversed, and maybe one of the Zs. <BR> <BR>My guess is that Hrant is on the right track, and that they are for photographic titles, in films or for slides. <BR> <BR>The magnets could act as spacers, so you can create a nice drop shadow. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen a similar style of art deco lettering used for titling in a 35mm colour slide show &#40;but made out of a thick white material&#41;. The slides dated from the mid &#39;50s. <BR> <BR>The appeal of this &#34;Broadway&#34; kind of Deco style at that late date would be because of its ease of manufacture.  <BR> <BR>While there were commercial lettering kits available, it&#39;s the kind of project you would find in Popular Mechanics magazine. Or maybe even an amateur photography magazine. <BR> <BR>Was your Grandad a bit of a handyman, Zara? Did he make these himself? Did he have the photography bug, too?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I think I have a set of the same thick, white lettering. And it is definitely made for creating dimensional titles - specifically for 8mm and 16mm home movies.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Zara! <BR> <BR>You&#39;re in luck! I first came in contact with these types of letters at Typecon last year as the folks from Timeless Treasures had an entire collection of pin-backed ceramic letters that John Downer informed me were used for department store marquees in the 40s and 50s which were in the front of the store to guide shoppers to featured specials, etc . . . <BR> <BR>Anyhow, Joan was kind enough to loan me some of these letters to turn into typefaces. The first result of this effort is a new freeward font called &#39;Featured Item&#39; check it out at: <a href="http://www.fontdiner.com" target="_blank">http://www.fontdiner.com</a> <BR> <BR>Beyond that, I have another set of letters Joan loaned me which were grossly incomplete but very cool looking. A few eBay searches later and I found the originals! Turns out they were no for store signage but as previously suggested in this post, were for home theater titling boards. . . . A great find at $9.99 <BR> <BR><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3853050776" target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3853050776</a> <BR> <BR>Anyhow, one thing that makes these letters so sweet is that they are very unique type styles that have essentially disappeared into history since they were in essence never cast by a foundry and only exist in this format for this purpose by the original manufacturers. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Stuart :D</div>
