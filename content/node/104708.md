body: 'I pulled this font sample for use in a magazine design. Now that I''m prepping
  the files for press I cannot locate the original source. I would assume this was
  a font, since the file is saved as typetester_image.php, but I have no idea where
  it''s from! I''ve searched You Work for Them and Myfonts with no luck so far. '
