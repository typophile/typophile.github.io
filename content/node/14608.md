  first official moderator shin gig), I'd like to inaugurate a trial <strong>\xBBCritique
  Thursday\xAB</strong> this Thursday, August 18th.\r\n\r\nThe critiquing will take
  place right here on Typophile, from 1\u20133 pm Eastern Standard Time (that should
  be 10 am\u201312 noon in California, 19:00\u201321:00 in Central Europe, etc.).\r\n\r\nI'll
  select one thread from each typeface style sub-section within the critique forum
  for special critique. That thread will have its name changed, just like marked threads
  in the Type ID forum. Everyone is invited to send some time in the alloted time
  slot checking out those threads and making great suggestions.\r\n\r\nI haven't selected
  any types yet. If anyone has suggestions, just e-mail 'em to me. Self promo is ok
  ;-)"

    In the spirit of self-promotion, I'd be happy to offer either my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/5985\">Century

  body: Raph, it certainly isn't limited to existing threads, but existing threads
    will be selected if nothing new and (as) exciting presents itself. Do you have
    a favorite of the two, or one that might elicit more critique discussion and less
    discussion discussion?

    Maybe the font's designer could choose a person as having been \"the most helpful\"
    at the end of the session, and that person gets a Typophile shirt? (If so, it'd
    be a shame that I already have too many shirts to really be motivated myself,
    but hey. :-)\r\n2) Limit the number of fonts \"on air\", like maybe to two.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I nominate this: http://typophile.com/node/14419\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Thursdays may not have \"one\" rep. from each category\u2026 some categories are
    used less than others, and some sorts of designs may need more assistance and
    others. I dunno\u2026 any feelings?"

    bummer.\r\n\r\nbut i agree with joe, that for a two-hour period, one pick from
    each font category might be a bit much."

  body: "Well, I'm still glad that I was able to shed so much light on so many fonts
    in so little time, but going forward, it just won't be practical to highlight
    one font per category: some categories have way less fonts in them.\r\n\r\nSo,
    tomorrow (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14813\">http://typophile.com/node/14813</a>),
    I'm only going to feature two fonts.\r\n\r\nHere's some discussion I most definitely
    would like some feedback on: post numbers.\r\n\r\nI've received several requests
    from designers wanting their fonts to be selected for critique, which is great.
    But some of those fonts have a lot of posts on their threads already (one even
    has 70+). I'd much rather pick out fonts that have gotten less attention\u2026
    I think that Critique Thursday would be of more benefit to those designers than
    to others who have already gotten a lot of feedback from the usual suspects (posters
    like Paul and Hrant, without whom, there really wouldn't be much of a critique
    forum to discuss). Of course we want as many people to post, but I think that
    is more likely to happen if so much hasn't been covered yet.\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    to Hrant's suggestion about prizes: I think that is a great idea, but I also don't
    think that we are ready for something like that yet. There needs to be much more
    volume of posting, I think, and some real \"objective\" judging process. And prizes.
    I don't have any toys yet to give away\u2026 :("
