  of the manual it says you can browse through preview strings in the metrics window
  using Cmd-PgDn &#43; PgUp. Does this work for anyone?  <BR> <BR>How do you preview
  strings of text? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m on OS9.2 with FL 4.5.1 <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Eric

  body: 'Eric: <BR>This post was stuck rolling around  in my head for a week. I may
    have an answer.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s what works for me: <BR> <BR>in the preview
    window &#40;Shift-Option-Cmd-m&#41; <BR> <BR>Make sure you&#39;ve got a preview
    text file selected by clicking on the ellipsis in the upper right corner. FL has
    a preview string text file chosen by default, but you can choose another file
    if you wish. <BR> <BR>Then move to the left, and pick a word from the arrow-up
    or down list. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the important part: Now, move the pointer to
    the preview pane itself, and click. This &#39;tells&#39; the application that
    you want to do something in the pane. Only after resetting the cursor will the
    Cmd-page up and down commands work. Otherwise you&#39;re left wondering why doesn&#39;t
    this work? <BR> <BR>Joe VanDerBos <BR><a href="http://www.joevanderbos.com/type/"
