  body: I think you will have a tough time finding these, because the red lettering
    looks like a customization of Benguiat Frisky &#40;the S and B are upside-down;
    and a new a and g have been used&#41; that has been given baseline bounce. <BR>
    <BR>The &#39;Children&#39;s Dentistry&#39; font  is similar to some of the <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&amp;startrow=1&amp;records=&amp;currpage=1&amp;totalrecords=7&amp;displayfontid=FF.7090.0.0&amp;searchby=searchresults&amp;fontRendererText=Childrens+Dentistry"
    target="_blank">&#39;Child&#39;s Play&#39;</a> fonts from FontFont, but only similar.
    It&#39;s very possible, since this style is so easy to create, that this is an
    original do-it-yourself font, or one from the countless amateur sites with handprinted
    fonts. You can have a font like this made for under $10 from your own printing,
    so anyone could have done it.

  body: 'The <b>f</b>, <b>g</b> and <b>t</b> in the red lettering matches a font called
    &#34;Artic&#34; in Rookledge&#39;s Type Finder &#40;1990 edition, sample #353
    shown below&#41;. The <b>a</b> and <b>p</b> don&#39;t match though. <BR> <BR><img

    <BR>Good catch on the upside-down <b>B</b> and <b>S</b>. I had initially thought
    of Benguiat Frisky but dismissed it because these letters didn&#39;t match. Hm..
    maybe the <b>p</b> is an upside-down <b>b</b>, and the <b>a</b> is a <b>d</b>
    with the ascender chopped off. And it&#39;s been squished, too. Who would do such
    a thing? Barbarians!'
