  cryptic, charming, humble or brooding?\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a brief based
  on a typographic portrayal of his 'Man In Black' so any suggestions on typefaces
  relating to the song in particular would be great also, although i guess Cash's
  personality and the song itself are going to have similar references.  \r\n\r\nAgain,
  any suggestions welcome.\r\nCheers"

  body: Yeah, I agree with jupiterboy--a straightforward, bold slab face. Oddly enough,
    even if you want it to print in a color, the type will only print black.

    outlaw and a criminal before he found God and turned into a \"good\" or \"lawful
    evil\" dude. After that point Cash entered the mainstream yet he remained permanently
    on the shady side of the law and the establishment.\r\n\r\nThese bulky, masculine
    slab serif candidates are in the ryte ballpark but they lack the subversiveness
    and non-conformity of the man himself. They're too conventional and law-abiding.
    (Oh some dys I will do anything just to get a few hyphenates in. Ah, that was
    a good hit back there).\r\n\r\nThe embarrassing part is I can't name any butch
    slab serifs that evoke these aspects of Johnny's personality.\r\n\r\nThey are
    all good candidates but they lack soul.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    is his musicality \u2013 from which there is a fine line to the vulnerability,
    even fragility that he displayed, in extremo, in his last years (that 'Hurt' video).
    Even for 'Man in Black', I'd at least mix in a shot of Archer (not use it; cross-breed
    it with some others) and stay at a reasonable distance from Facebuster and the
    like \u2013 those feel too loud, brutal, and yes, they exude more of a law-abiding,
    unbroken masculinity than I'd see in Cash.\r\nUnfortunately, my knowledge of the
    type universe is not such that I could throw in a couple names that do exactly
    what I'm trying to describe, though. :-("

  body: "I see a massive change in Cash's life after he became a christian.  Earlier
    I see rebellion, strength, arrogance even.  I think of this as a big bold slab
    serif with funky angles.\r\n\r\nThen, later in life he softened, he let his guard
    down and yes, became fragile and beautiful like a spider's web or a glass sculpture.
    \ I don't see him losing his masculinity in this at all, but he had less armor
    protecting the real Johnny inside.  This period I see as a script, or some light-weight
    yet sturdy serif, something that has a very personal touch.\r\n\r\nI think later
    in life he also became very aware of his mortality, he probably had a lot of close
    calls earlier in life, but I think a man changes when he realizes he might not
    be around much longer, I think his purpose and his focus changed totally from
    before - so I don't think I could summarize his entire life into just one typeface."

  body: "i'd say because it's a portrayal of the song more so than his personality,
    and the two perhaps aren't exactly the same. So it would be a representation of
    \ the period he wrote the song.\r\n\r\nI don't think the typeface has to be bang
    on - it just needs to fit, the song portrayal will be emphasized with how i treat
    the type and the lyrics and print methods etc i choose. \r\n\r\nOn another note
    I am going to contrast this with another song, i was thinking 'White Christmas'
    - Bing Crosby. One song is quite brutally honest for that period of time and the
    other is more of a song for escapism and \"feel good\" listening (in my opinion).
    Oh yeah one's black and the others white, ha. \r\n\r\nCheers again for all the
    input!"

  body: Perhaps the task can be handled by a pairing of typefaces. I personally think
    Leviathan or Ziggurat by H&FJ would look great with a sharp serif like Farnham.
    If you want a grotesque, Maple by Process Type Foundry or National by Klim could
    work.

    see Hoefler types as a quite radical new take on your local culture (I'm speaking

    having met Stan Ridgway on his BBS, I would have liked to try a design of his
