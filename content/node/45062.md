    Garamond and the x-height is comparable, you could use the combi in one line of
    text also. But i would prefer Gill Sans over Syntax aesthetically, if we speak
    of classics.\r\n\r\nPS \r\n2 designers, 3 opinions :)"

    point, as we now have reasons coming into play. Gives the 'opinion' more substance.

  body: "I'd say definitely NOT Walbaum or Clarendon. Using those will put you in
    the dangerous territory of mixing serifed typefaces on the same page. You need
    something to contrast with Garamond, and Clarendon and especially Walbaum are
    too close.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm going to have to give yet another differing opinion
    and suggest Franklin Gothic. For no other reason than I really like Frankoin Gothic,
    and I think it goes nicely with Garamond (in particular, Adobe Garamond)."

  body: "Franklin Gothic will sit very well with Adobe Garamond; they both have the
    classic feel that lends credibility to a piece. Syntax could work, but Myriad/Fruitiger
    would be a better humanist to go with as they have a little less personality on
    their own. IMHO Syntax works best on its own; that way it doesn\u2019t distract
    from the copy, and there\u2019s enough contrast in the weights that it makes a
    fine all-around book face. "
