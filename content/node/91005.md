body: I am keen to know the name of the typeface that appears throughout Dutch graphic
  designer Karel Martens' classic graphic design book 'Printed Matter', in the body
  copy. I've attached a sample from the book so you can see. I've wanted to know this
  for ages! Does anyone know where I can get the font?
