  am looking for typefaces that are similar to this, more of a modern style but keeping
  similar flourishes. This one is hand drawn so I know it doesnt exist as a font but
  there may be something similar. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "As far as I can determine the S font was cut by Schuenemann as Euclid for
    \ Cleveland. No patent found. Schuenemann worked for Central before Cleveland
    and while at Cleveland also cut some fonts for Central. Don't know if this includes
    Euclid. The Cleveland version was very a creative and ambitious effort that occupied
    8 pages of the 1894 specimen book and included alternate capitals with sweeping
    swashes. \r\nThe swash initials are captured in Ryoichi Tsunekawa's Great Victorian
    http://dharmatype.com/dharma-type/great-victorian.html \r\nAnother version by
    Claude Pelletier  http://www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font\r\nCopying competitors typefaces
    and using different names is nothing new. From Euclid @ Central&Cleveland and
    Templar @ Palmer&Rey in the 1880s to the current batch found by Ryuk the practice
    never ends.\r\nBTW, a link to Sophie MF that does not require downloading an exe

  body: "Campanile, which has a somewhat similar S to Euclid/Templar is an older font
    by Mackellar Smiths Jordan,  cut and patented by William Jackson in 1879. \r\nCymbeline
    appears to be an original by David F. Nalle [1993] but he gave no information
    as to the source of the design http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=cymbeline&Category_Code=
    Steffmann's Cardinal is a pirate copy -- exact match of nodes etc -- with some
    added characters. Rick Mueller's Wish MF [1997] differs in detail from Nalle's
    font and may also be an original. Wedlock [1998] is definitely an original --
    based on type purchased by Dan X. Solo. it's the best digitization of this design.\r\nDon"

  body: "RYGGERIETS: As far as I can determine this concept was designed by William
    F. Page in 1872 as a numbered type -- apparently not patented -- which later became
    known as Teutonic. This seems to be accurately revived by Jordan Davies. The foundry
    version seems to have been created at Mackellar Smiths Jordon with the name Fantail.
    Minor variations. OPTI might be closest to the foundry version. Edited versions
    are Nick Curtis' Fredericksburg and Richard Beatty's Wanted. See http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/richard_beatty/wanted_regular_ot/opentype_cff/\r\n"
