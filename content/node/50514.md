body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nCurrently working on a promotional poster for myself... I have
  purchased Blender Pro as a sort of logotype font for myself, and am looking for
  something that complements it. I know Blender Pro/Gridnik can read quite well as
  a body copy font, but I don't really want to detract from the logo. \r\n\r\nIf you
  guys have any suggestions about what fonts would complement Blender Pro (yet still
  differentiate itself), I'd love to hear them. Right now I am playing around with
  flama light/thin. I like the way it has a more fluid and round (sort of how Blender
  varies from Gridnik), but thought I'd just try some other things out!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBen"
