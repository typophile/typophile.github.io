body: Hello, newbie to the forum, but figured this was a good place to start. My grandfather
  recently passed, and I'm working on an art piece for him but I'm having trouble
  locating a particular font. I want one that will represent the emblems on his favorite
  car, 56 dodge coronet. Any help would be much appreciated. Looking in particular
  for letters M, C, G, upper and lower case[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dodge
