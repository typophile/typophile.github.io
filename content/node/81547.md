  within threads. Clicking on the timestamp of any comment will produce the link.\r\n\r\nI
  have noticed that this doesn't seem to work when the comment to be linked appears
  on a page beyond the first in a multi-page thread. The link doesn't insert the required
  \"page=n&\" into the address, so following the link just goes to the top of the
  first page of the thread."

    workaround, not a solution to the bug."

    ; notice that it is \"page=1\" and it is page 2 (it is always one less). The timestamp
    should indeed contain the page number (I added a blank before the semicolon for
    the link to work).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oneless_6051.jpg]"

  body: Yes, I successfully added the page number manually as Michel suggests when
    I tried it, but seeing Florian's workaround I wonder if Michel's would break based
    on having a different setting for comments per page. Is that a user-adjustable
    setting, by the way?

  body: "<cite>Is that a user-adjustable setting?</cite>\r\nNo, at the moment not.
    But it has been adjusted globally in the past\r\n\r\nAlso, there is the (unlikely)
    possibility that you want to link to comment no. n+1 (n = maximum number of comments
    per page), and later on, an older comment gets deleted, making the one in question
    the n-th."

  body: I just counted (in fact, I wrote a script to count) the number of comments
    for each page of http://www.typophile.com/node/123 and I get 90 comments per page
    for page 1 to 7, and then less than 90 comments on page 8. What does the number
    5000 then represent in <code>comments_per_page=5000</code> ?

  body: "This number overrides the default maximum number of comments per page (yes,
    90 \u2013 <em>at the moment</em>) . You can also enter a different value. But
    with a value as large as 5000, you practically request a thread with all its comments,
    as a single page."

  body: And with http://www.typophile.com/node/123?from=0&comments_per_page=5000 I
    indeed get a single page! Thanks.

  body: "And I think the clean solution is a link like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/123?page=5&from=0&comments_per_page=90#comment-348557\r\n\r\nthat
    specifies the page number but also the current number of comments per page, namely
    90. You are then linked to the right page (and not to a single page thread) and
    even if the number of comments per page ever changes, the link will still be valid.\r\n\r\n"
