  body: 'They are generally pretty reliable, especially when dealing with general
    rules such as whether mathematical operators should be slanted in italic fonts.
    <BR> <BR>Most of the information about diacritics is okay, but there are some
    omissions and imprecisions. For example: <BR> <BR>When discussing under comma
    accents and cedillas, the MS design standards say that &#39;An under comma is
    an acceptable alternative to a connecting cedilla for the following characters...&#39;,
    and goes on to list C/c cedilla and the misnames Unicode characters K/k L/l N/n
    and R/r with cedilla. This gives the wrong impression. The choice of whether a
    cedilla connects to C/c is a design option, and is also culturally important as
    the MS design standard notes. However, the correct form for the other letters
    is not optional: these should all be the under comma accent form <i>not</i> the
    cedilla. <BR> <BR>Note that there are no languages currently using T/t with cedilla,
    so a single T/t with under comma glyph can be double mapped for both the T/t weith
    cedilla and with under comma Unicode characters. <BR> <BR>In the section on the
    caron accent, the MS design standards correctly note that the Slovak D/d and T/t
    with caron take different forms in upper- and lowercase. The uppercase form takes
    the typical, inverted circumflex form, but the lowercase takes the apostrophe
    form. However, the MS design standard omits the L/l with caron, also used in Slovak,
    in which both upper- and lowercase take the apostrophe form.'

  body: Names for diacritics or &#39;glyphs&#39; were taken from PostScript or Unicode
    descriptions and are not character codes or technical names just descriptions.
    Many human readable names such as PostScript are not &#39;correct&#39; see the
    French quotes which are a &#39;guillemet&#39; in French and &#39;guillemot&#39;
    in PostScript, or a Duck. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve given pointers in the overview for
    the Unicode and PostScript &#39;glyph&#39; code or names.  <BR> <BR>Names can
    be tricky, at Microsoft the word &#39;character&#39; is never used to mean &#39;glyph&#39;
    it means &#39;character code&#39; and not &#39;letter&#39; or &#39;glyph&#39;.
    You type a &#39;character&#39; you get a &#39;glyph&#39;. <BR> <BR>Names are not
    always universal, see the ntilde, it&#39;s not considered correct.
