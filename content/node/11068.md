  to be in Paris for a couple days&#41;, and I was wondering if anyone has reccommendations
  for places to visit to see cool design/type related stuff. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    the best design bookshop in the world &#40;that I&#39;ve visited&#41;. Be sure
    to ask to see the antiquarian section also: this is upstairs and you&#39;ll find
    many gems.'

  body: Also there is a great place for magazines on Spui. &#40;that&#39;s a street
    or more like a square, you&#39;ll find it on the map...&#41; &#43; Just walk around.
    As in any city, there are gems everywhere. I&#39;ve got a few Amsterdam pics on
    my site. <BR>But why didn&#39;t I know about that bookstore...

  body: It&#39;s been a while since my last visit, but I believe Kenn is refering
    to <a href="http://www.athenaeum.nl/"> Athenaeum Boekhandel</a> a bookstore with
    a very good magazine section in the building next door. Also there used to be
    an antique book market on Spui too, I think it was on wednesdays but ask around.
    And, like John said, don&#39;t miss Nijhoff &amp; Lee. They are responsible for
    a good part of my personal library <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>- jdf <BR> <BR>ps. are you going to be there
    for the Queen&#39;s Birthday? One of the craziest street-party weekends in the
    world!

  body: This isn&#39;t so much a typography/graphic design thing, but if you can make
    it over to Rotterdam for a day, a visit to the Kunsthal would be worth it. I&#39;m
    sure the exhibits are great, but it&#39;s the building that&#39;s amazing - by
    <a href="http://www.oma.nl/index_flash.htm" target="_blank"> Rem Koolhaas and
    OMA</a>. They also did the Byzantium Building in Amsterdam and part of the urban
    planning for the Amsterdam-Noord ferry.
