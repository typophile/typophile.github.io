body: "Hey everyone, new to the board and glad to be here.\r\n\r\nI need help in identifying
  this particular typeface. It's taken from the drink cup of \"The Hamburger Stand\"
  (formerly known as The Original Hamburger Stand), a chain of food joints in the
  Southwestern United States. The Galardi Group is the parent company if that helps
  in identifying design/marketing houses they may have worked with for producing this
  updated logo in the 90s. Any help in identifying this or similar fonts would be
  greatly appreciated! Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/hamburgerstand_5461.jpg]"

    Mostly, they've set it tighter but there also seems to be a stroke added to make
    the letters bolder. The "H" is redrawn.
