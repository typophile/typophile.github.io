  the x-height and even the descender height are all bigger in the case of Verdana,
  what makes them both be \"48pt\"?"

  body: "Back in the old days, type consisted of little rectangular pieces of an alloy
    of lead with other metals. And thus type was 14 point type if the type slugs took
    up 14 points of space.\r\n\r\nThe x-height of one face might be much larger than
    that of another, giving it a subjectively larger appearance, but that did not
    matter.\r\n\r\nThat would still seem to mean, though, that the type size should
    fairly closely match the cap height plus the descender length. (In some typefaces,
    letters like the lowercase d or h have ascenders that extend significantly beyond
    the cap height, however.)\r\n\r\nBut even in the days of metal type, other factors
    existed that led to there being some unused space on the face of the type slug.
    Typefounders found that printers would sometimes like to mix different typefaces
    on the same line of text; for example, some typefaces might have a Roman and an
    italic, but no bold face, and, thus, the printer would have to use a different
    typeface for a bold.\r\n\r\nSo they ended up designing \"lining\" fonts, where
    the baseline of every typeface occupied the same position on the type slug. To
    avoid too much waste, however, if a face had either very short or very long descenders,
    then the baseline might be shifted up or down by some multiple of 1/2 point so
    that ordinary leading could be used to align the baseline of such a face with
    that of an ordinary face.\r\n\r\nAll this means is that type size is simply a
    measure of the space a line must take up as a minimum, and how much of that space
    is actually used by the letterforms is arbitrary."

  body: "Thanks. Just found the definition of \"body height\" on Wikipedia. I take
    it there is no typographical characteristic of a font that defines the relation
    between the body height and the font size?\r\n\r\n(all of this started as I was
    looking for a font that appears \"smaller\" at a fixed size, and realizing that
    some with small x-height are actually larger, etc)"

    no <em>visual</em> characteristic. Font size, as specified in points, is the height
    of the body, but the relationship of the letter shape to that height is variable."

  body: "<cite> ...  realizing that some with small x-height are actually larger,
    etc. </cite>\r\n\r\nTotal height, cap height, and x-height are quite independent
    of each other. Zapfino, for example, has *huge* capitals combined with tiny lower
    case letters.\r\n\r\nIs it correct to state the actual font size refers directly
    to the <em>design grid size</em> -- usu. 1000 units for a Postscript flavor font
    and 2048 for a TrueType one? And when a designer is drawing a font, he usually
    stays within that bounding box?  (Although it's quite possible to have elements
    stick out of it.)"

  body: '@John Hudson - the Wikipedia definition of "body height" might not be correct
    ("distance between the top of the tallest letterform to the bottom of the lowest
    one") because that, coupled with your "Font size, as specified in points, is the
    height of the body" would contradict my original example, no? -i.e. top of "h"
    to bottom of "p" should''ve been the same for Verdana and Calibri'

  body: "The Wikipedia definition is not correct, although type is often scaled relative
    to the body such that this definition is apt. It is easiest to think about the
    body height in terms of metal type, which allows you to actually see the body.
    The body height is not the height of the letter, but the height of the piece of
    metal on the face of which the letter appears. This is well illustrated in <a
    href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hypowren/2234536811/\">this photograph</a>.
    See how all the pieces of metal type are of uniform height, regardless of which
    letter appears on them? That's the body height. In a 12pt font of type, the body
    height would be 12 points high. In scalable digital type, the letters are plotted
    on a unit grid, the full height of which is the body height and is scaled to the
    nominal text size.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reasons which an individual typeface
    might be \u2018cast small on the body\u2019, and hence be visually smaller than
    another typeface at the same nominal font size. In my work, a common reason for
    this is inclusion of more than one writing system within a single font, making
    different use of the grid space, e.g. Latin and Arabic. Arabic tends to have deeper
    descenders than Latin, and hence in order to visually harmonise the two scripts
    the Latin needs to be smaller than it would be if it were not a companion to the
    Arabic. In the case of Calibri, and the other Microsoft CT fonts, we knew when
    we started developing them that they would be extended for alphabets such as Vietnamese
    that require vertically stacked diacritic marks, so did not occupy the full body
    height with the ascenders and descenders."
