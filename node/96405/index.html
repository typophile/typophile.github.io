<p><em>Quel dommage</em>: being me is not particularly easy these days, especially since my wife&rsquo;s mind got totally blown, two weeks ago today. The doctors have no idea what happened, or if she will ever recover.</p>
<p>However, on a positive note, Jeff Beck—dog-faced boy with cat-like eyes—was, evidently, expecting me that fall day in 1965, so I figure that he&rsquo;s in on it, too…whatever it is. The Great Pretender, Jimmy Page, never got what Jeff passed on to me; this rendition is totally wrong, and isn&rsquo;t it odd that you NEVER see Page&rsquo;s face in this video…</p>

<p>Chris, I would suggest my “magic formula”—I lost over fifty-five founds in the past six months and no longer need meds to control my cholesterol, solely with amino acids and vitamins costing less than a dollar a day—but, so far, no one has joined me in my Grand Experiment…because, I suppose, there is some minor trepidation that my “formula” may contribute to my being certifiably loony. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth: I went around the bend LOOOONG before then.</p>

<p>Less is, indeed, more. So far, I have managed several six-day stints of nothing more than bread and water—cleverly disguised as Beck&rsquo;s Non-alcoholic Beer—and found the results edifying. Hell: even my eight-day self-imposed bread-and-water diet while in the custody of the Fairfax County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department&rsquo;s Restricted Issue Unit (read: torture/mind control chamber) wasn&rsquo;t all that bad. Well, relatively speaking, at least. Bonus: working-class hero street creds. The local skateboarders suggested a Mike Tyson-style tattoo; I am thinking maybe a henna version might be more appropriate…and, definitely, AFTER my trials, not before.</p>
<p>But, after I staged my hunger strike and busted up the operation, I found myself thirty-five miles from home, without a penny on me, I came across a fig tree in full bloom along the side of the road! It was…well…transcendental. The Lord works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>BTW, a remake of this little gem will be my next project&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re. eating:</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting is indeed a good thing. If you consider that for most of our species' history on the planet we were subsisted on hunting and gathering it is clear that we are evolved, like all hunting animals, to irregular periods of eating and fasting. The notion of three meals per day at fixed times is an invention of the agricultural and industrial periods, and have more to do with the regulation of work than with the needs of the human body.</p>
<p>With regard to diet, weight and health, though, what matters is not how much you eat but <em>what you eat.</em> The fallacy that what matters is calories consumed and calories burned presumes that the human body is a simple thermodynamic engine. It isn&rsquo;t: it is a complex biochemical engine that does different things with different input: 500 calories of protein, 500 calories of fat and 500 calories of sugar are processed in completely different ways and have very different effects on weight and health. Chris, you mention that you eat less than 1,200 calories per day, eat no meat and never lose weight, and also that you suffer from arthritis, heart disease, asthma, and COPD. Am I right in thinking that your diet includes hefty amounts of carbohydrates, bowel irritants and inflammation-causing &lsquo;foods&rsquo; such as grains, rice, corn, beans, etc..</p>
<p>People have various theories about the significance of the paintings at Lascaux and Chauvet and other palaeolithic sites. It seems obvious to me: <a href="http://deitchman.com/mcneillslides/images/lascaux-hunters.jpg">they&rsquo;re instruction manuals on what to eat</a>. Note the absence of potatoes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, what was your source for that information? To my knowledge, there is nothing in meat that acts as a bowel irritant: if there were, the human species would probably never have survived. This is not to say that meat is easy to digest <em>if</em> your bowels are inflamed or perforated, but that&rsquo;s not the fault of the meat but of what is causing inflammation or perforation. Stopping eating meat may simply mask the damage that is being done by making you less aware of problems in your digestive tract. I recommend reading up on lectins in grains, seeds and beans, and their affect on intestinal metabolism and damage.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, meat made mind: humans beings are so because we became carnivorous as a species about a quarter of a million years ago. Myelin, a.k.a. white matter, is about two-thirds fat and one-third protein. A diet rich in fat and protein is essential to brain growth, which effectively ceases after age thirty, at which time fat and protein get stored…and cause health problems, obviously. Eating like a kid is good for kids, but not for adults.</p>
<p>OTOH, you can retune your body for a twenty-five-year-old&rsquo;s metabolism, if you have a mind to. Fifty-seven pounds in six months—documented by my nurse practitioner—is proof of claim. Unfortunately, the process leaves you terminally loony…or, so I am told.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s something to make you popular with both: ask them to provide you with peer reviewed journal articles of controlled experiments on which they have based their advice. I&rsquo;ve given up accepting the advice of any nutritionist or dietician on authority because the bias in their studies are now so blatant that they <a href="http://garytaubes.com/2012/03/science-pseudoscience-nutritional-epidemiology-and-meat/">barely qualify as science</a>.</p>
<p>Nick: <em>at which time fat and protein get stored…and cause health problems, obviously. </em></p>
<p>I can reliably say that the weight and health problems of people on a modern diet have far, far more to do with sugar intake than with fat and protein. It is really difficult to get overweight on a diet of fat and protein: I know because I eat plenty but weigh 30lbs less than I did last summer and my body fat percentage has dropped to 14%. This from simply avoiding most sugars and all grain and legumes. I eat plenty of meat and lots of fat, and leafy green vegetables, brassicas and squashes; I don&rsquo;t get hungry, even when I fast most of a day, and my energy level remains comfortably high (rather than running through the peaks and troughs of sugar burning). Oh, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve become terminally loony in the process.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the reason. You should ask him to check his facts because you should always ask for sources when taking health advice, and you should look critically at the science behind the advice. I never said that I disagreed with his diagnosis, only questioned what I presume is only one aspect of the treatment (as you presented it, i.e. &lsquo;meat is a bowel irritant&rsquo;). The fact that you&rsquo;ve been advised off meat but are allowed to eat bread simply looks very inconsistent with what is known about the role of lectins in intestinal damage and associated conditions. It&rsquo;s odd to me because roughly the opposite approach is recommended by other doctors and dieticians &ndash; cut out the grains, up the animal protein &ndash;, and I know about the science on which that advice is based. So I&rsquo;d like to know on what science the advice you received is based. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know too? Or is it enough that the guy has a white coat? Even if you just ask him to explain <em>what</em> is bad about meat, what causes it to be a problem for your digestive tract, he should be able to give a physiological explanation. If he can&rsquo;t, I would be concerned.</p>

<p>You may believe what you wish: if it works for you, then so be it. OTOH, &ldquo;if it works for you&rdquo; IS the operative term. What works for me, works for me…which means, occasionally, meat AND sugar, both of which I remediate and/or burn off quickly. In fact, with my regimen, I can pretty much eat anything I want and maintain my svelte 138-lb. figure.</p>
<p>I can also pretty much totally manage my ATP production consciously, which is quite useful when fight-or-flight situations occur: no holdover ACTH problems to deal with later on.</p>

<p>My only suggestion — and your nutritionist has probably already suggested this — is that since you&rsquo;ve given up meat you need to make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough protein. All of us lose muscle mass as we get older, which can lead to muscle weakness, falls, etc., and lack of protein can make this worse as it is needed to maintain muscles. But if you&rsquo;re still eating fish this probably isn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>

<p>Which is good advice so far as it goes. I would only add &lsquo;Ask the doctor what is the basis for his advice&rsquo;. Seriously, otherwise you&rsquo;re just trusting the fact that this guy has a white coat. Yes, he has a medical degree, but you&rsquo;ve no idea how up to date he is with current research, what biases he subscribes to, or how critically he engages with the research the underpins his treatment plans. Given that standard of care by doctors, specialists and dieticians is demonstrably failing to curb massive increase in diabetes, obesity and metabollic syndrome, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me unreasonable to ask on what basis nutrition advice, in particular, is based.</p>

<p>Er, no, when it comes to physical reality I can&rsquo;t believe what I wish, and I recognise that &lsquo;working for me&rsquo; is merely anecdotal evidence, as is Chris' &lsquo;feeling better&rsquo;. There are people who feel better after taking homeopathic remedies, despite the fact that most of these remedies do not even contain <em>any</em> active ingredient and none have passed a single controlled trial since testing of them began well over a hundred years ago. When it comes to physical reality, I rely on the physical sciences, which means reading the science and evaluating it, and in the case of health and nutrition critically interrogating the use of science by healthcare professionals. If someone tells me that &lsquo;meat is a bowel irritant&rsquo; I really do want to know on what basis that claim is made. I&rsquo;m not choosing to believe or disbelieve something about physical reality, I am asking for information about the claim so that I can form a reasoned judgement of it. In order to be a bowel irritant, something that you eat must contain something that interacts with the digestive tract in a way that causes stress or damage to it. Okay, so what in meat meets that criterion? That seems to me a very reasonable question to ask when someone claims that meat is a bowel irritant. How is it a bowel irritant? What is the physiological process involved?</p>
<p>As it happens, I can think of one really easy way in which meat might be a bowel irritant, and that is if the meat is from grain-fed cattle, because then the meat will contain lectins from the grain, and lectins definitely are bowel irritants (and worse: through damage to the intestines they enter the bloodstream and are a factor in autoimmune diseases; the damage they cause also allows other molecules that shouldn&rsquo;t enter the bloodstream to do so). But obviously the culprit here is not meat per se, but the grain that the animal was fed, contrary to its natural diet. Which takes me back to my surprise that Chris received advice to give up meat but not, apparently, to give up grain, despite the fact that grain is frequently one of the first things that people with bowel problems are told to avoid.</p>
<p>As I suggested in my first comment on this subject, &lsquo;feeling better&rsquo; is not an objective measure of bowel health, because some of the most damaging results of irritation and perforation of the intestines are not experienced as intestinal discomfort. Hence, removing meat from the diet might relieve some symptoms while masking ongoing problems caused by other substances.</p>
<p>Last summer I began eating in a particular way because I came to the conclusion that the scientific basis for doing so was sound, and that the scientific basis for much of the advice proffered in public policy and by professional nutritionists was without merit. How did I come to that conclusion? By looking at the science and evaluating it, and examining the way the science was being used in forming public policy and nutritionist eating plans. I don&rsquo;t think this constitutes &lsquo;believing what I wish&rsquo;. Nor is this conclusion founded on &lsquo;what works for me&rsquo;, which came later. I will note, however, that in addition to feeling good, I am healthier than I was a year ago by objective measures: blood pressure, weight and body fat percentage, active pulse rate, etc..</p>

<p>Were you able to furnish the client with reasons why the logo should be something other than blue? Or even why it might be blue, but independent of his like or dislike of the colour?</p>
<p>What bothered you about this encounter: the fact that someone who is not a designer was suggesting to you, the design professional, a design solution? or the fact that the solution suggested was wrong? In the case of people following medical advice from non-doctors, what matters is surely that if wrong the advice may result in worsening of disease or even death. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to preclude patients asking doctors to explain the reason for diagnosis and treatment, rather than accepting on authority what someone in a white coat tells them.</p>
<p>This is in part a generational thing, I think. My parents and grandparents accepted what they were told by doctors without question, just as they largely accepted what they were told by teachers and politicians (clergy to a far lesser extent: we were never a very religious family). And my critical stance also has a personal aspect: my father spent the last decade of his life eating a low fat diet as insisted on by his doctors, and then died of kidney disease, a factor of which turned out to be not enough fat in his diet.</p>

<p>Red meat — especially fatty meat — is a common trigger food for IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).</p>
<p>I too must avoid certain foods because medical tests showed they caused problems for me. It&rsquo;s very common for folks to have allergies or intolerances for certain foods (milk, gluten, eggs, or whatever), even though most folks can consume those foods without problems.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know, but my guess is that it affects people who are deficient in certain stomach enzymes needed to break down protein, which leads to undigested meat being passed into the intestines.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is somewhat similar to people who have lactose (milk) intolerance. They lack the stomach enzymes to break down milk, so it passes undigested into the intestines and causes problems.</p>

<p>By the way, I think IBS still suffers from having for so long been denied as a real condition by health professionals, leading to much of the information about it being ad hoc and anecdotal, compiled by sufferers trying to make sense of their experience. Indeed, the categorisation of &lsquo;syndrome&rsquo; is really a way of saying &lsquo;There&rsquo;s this mix of symptoms experienced by different people in different combinations that we think might be related to each other in some way&rsquo;.

<p>As I would be too, but it hardly seems that being selective about what one eats means that one gets no pleasure from food.  Indeed, from my perspective, thinking about diet and nutrition is primarily a process of determining what constitutes food and unfood, so is arguably independent of gustatory considerations. If arsenic tasted really good, would you consider it food despite what you know about its affect on the body? Would you talk about it in terms of a balanced diet and encourage &lsquo;moderation&rsquo; as the sole virtue of consumption?</p>
<p>Most notions of what constitutes food are entirely culturally determined, inherited from ancestors who, for the most part, had limited options in terms of nutrition and little knowledge about the chemical components of what they ate and the affect of these things on this bodies. Things that killed them quickly were classified as poisonous, but things that killed them slowly frequently made it into the food category because they made no association between the consumption of these things and the health problems from which they suffered. Today, some of these foods are being consumed in such increased quantities and in processed forms that rapidly increase their metabolism by the body that things that used to kill people slowly are now killing them quickly. They don&rsquo;t call type 2 diabetes &lsquo;adult-onset&rsquo; any more, because too many children have it.</p>

<cite>but things that killed them slowly frequently made it into the food category because they made no association between the consumption of these things and the health problems from which they suffered.</cite></p>
<p>A lot of the things that are today regarded as things that kill people slowly are good sources of calories and proteins. Which make them highly preferable to starvation, which kills people quickly.</p>
<p>And which is why we have <em>evolved</em> to find foods that taste sweet, or that taste like meat, or which include fat, as desirable. Vegetables, on the other hand, tend to taste bitter, and other things that taste bitter are poisonous and kill quickly.</p>
<p>In the past, it isn&rsquo;t just that people were ignorant about nutrition. It is that food - especially meat - was scarce, and so regarding it as very important to eat all the meat you could was entirely rational from a nutritional standpoint. People tended to be malnourished in respect of calories and proteins, while the foods they did have available, like turnips and cabbage, provided them with the vitamins they needed.</p>
<p>Today, the abundance of food that we have has turned this upside-down, so our innate food preferences, instead of pushing us towards a healthier diet pull us away from it.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t a case of random cultural preferences that were never related to our bodies' needs.</p>
<p>Oh, also: I had encountered the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, and their rendition of the theme from Shaft, before - which, I suppose, won&rsquo;t surprise you.</p>
<p>However, most of my musical tastes are more conventional, if highly pedestrian. Still, even for that kind of music, I do sometimes go a little [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P37JbBnJIaY|out of the way]] (Onna Jonka Annoin Pois, as sung by Eila Pellinen; from the late &lsquo;fifties, but in a style reminiscent of an earlier time than that - a jazz/torch song about the love she let get away) and I also brave [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcR3K6mVctw|deadly earworms]] (this is reputed to be one of the worst, Walter Wanderley&rsquo;s Hammond organ rendition of &ldquo;Summer Samba&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;So Nice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Samba de Verão&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Which is exactly why I wrote that we inherit our categories of food from ancestors who, for the most part, <em>had limited options in terms of nutrition.</em> This is not the situation that most of us in the west are now in, so it seems to me entirely reasonable to take a look at what we eat in terms of long term health affects rather than as if we were in risk of immediate starvation and needing whatever calories and nutrients come to hand. And, again, that means actually looking at the evidence and reading the science, not just uncritically accepting what your ancestors, a government &lsquo;healthy eating guide&rsquo;, or a nutritionist tells you.</p>
<p>You mention evolution, and I think that can&rsquo;t pass without comment. Genetically, humans are in no way significantly different than we were c. 66,000 years ago (the most precisely stated short estimation I&rsquo;ve found, more general estimations tend to be longer). What this means in nutritional terms is that our digestive systems and the way we make use of different kinds of fuel evolved before many of the staples of our civilisational diets were part of what we ate. Agriculture dates from approximately 12,000 years ago, so whatever else we can say about the nutritional value of annual grains, cultivated legumes, or fruit bred for sweetness, we cannot say that we evolved to eat them.</p>
<p>When palaeontologists examine ancient human remains, one of the things they can determine pretty much immediately is whether they are from palaeolithic or neolithic cultures, because the neolithic skeletons will on average be several inches shorter than the palaeolithic, and will exhibit tooth decay, scoliosis and degenerative bone problems, and other indicators of poorer physical health. And the defining difference between the palaeolithic and the neolithic is the change from a hunter gatherer diet to an agricultural diet, from eating meat, fish and wild vegetation to eating large amounts of grains and cultivated legumes. And exactly the same kinds of health issues have been documented among living populations making the transition from traditional diets to modern civilisational diets as recently as the 20th Century.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paul, your notion of &lsquo;hedonic calculus&rsquo; is problematic in a number of ways. It seems an attractively simple means of responding to physical sensations that are of immediate or short term association with particular actions, but even then it treats as certainty what can easily be coincidental correlation. Take my initial exchange with Chris regarding eating meat: if someone notes that they get a stomach ache when they eat red meat, following hedonic calculus they decide to stop eating red meat, and the effect of this might be that they stop getting stomach aches. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that red meat caused the stomach ache, or it might be only a proximate cause, while the root cause &ndash; e.g. enzyme depletion or bowel perforation &ndash; might continue <em>unfelt</em>. And here is the biggest problem with hedonic calculus: it relies on immediate or short term correlation of physical sensation to particular actions &ndash; eating this or drinking that, in some particular quantity and/or some particular preparation &ndash;, so is completely useless as a means of determining what constitutes good or bad actions with regard to long term health. You give the example of someone who decides to stop drinking, or stop drinking so much, because one day he decides that the hangover isn&rsquo;t worth it or that drunkenness has resulted in him doing something unacceptable that he regrets. Neither the pleasure he used to get from drinking to excess nor the hangover tell him anything useful about the state of his liver, and by the time he <em>feels</em> physical sensations related to liver damage the damage has been done.</p>
<p>You define hedonic calculus as &lsquo;a technical term for something that can only be done by feel&rsquo;. But eating with an eye to long term health is <em>not</em> something that can only be done by feel.</p>
<p>Now, if you simply want to say that you don&rsquo;t care about long term health, and are happy to accept any consequence at all of what you eat and drink, that&rsquo;s your prerogative. I&rsquo;m no puritan. What I am saying, though, is that if one is concerned with long term health in terms of diet and nutrition, then one has to take an evidence-based approach. Ad hoc and anecdotal feedback, including how you feel, can be useful in gauging the effectiveness of particular diet and nutrition choices, especially when related to objective measures such as blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body fat percentage and (less usefully, at least in isolation) body mass index. But unless you plan to experiment in a hedonic way with every possible way of eating, you have to start from a set of principles arrived at from evidence, which means looking at the science and looking at it critically.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s eating nut breads, he&rsquo;ll get Vitamin C, and there is even a small amount in flax seed. So my money would be on the total absence of Vitamin B12 finishing him off. Unlike most other vitamins, B12 is only available naturally from animal sources, and deficiency is associated with a whole raft of both physical and mental pathologies.</p>

<p>Which hunter gatherer societies are you talking about? Do you have comparative height data? Do a Google image search for hunter gatherers, and what you will see is lots of photos from around the world of the classic hunter gatherer physique: long and lean and well muscled with very upright posture, all indicative of excellent bone health and good protein levels.</p>
<p>The increase in height among modern westerners is a phenomenon of the past hundred years or so, during which time we have <em>regained</em> a lot of height that our ancestors lost for thousands of years. That is, we&rsquo;re back to a similar height as our palaeolithic ancestors were. There&rsquo;s no doubt that the abundance of food we have access to, especially regular protein, has had a great epigenetic benefit in terms of height in many western countries. Conversely, hunter gatherer societies today are subject to modern pressures that affect their access to nutrition: constriction of their traditional roaming territories by agriculture and forestry, destruction of wetlands, forced relocation, pollution, etc.. Yet despite that, they remain taller and fitter than their near neighbours who are working the land and living on beans and rice and corn and bread. For modern westerners and hunter gatherers the same is true: access to regular meat protein makes you taller.</p>

<cite>Really, who in the heck thought that agriculture was a good idea?</cite></p>
<p>I blame women. They just couldn&rsquo;t take it when their babies kept dying as a result of unreliable food supplies.</p>
<p>And, of course, without agriculture, we wouldn&rsquo;t have civilization; without civilization, we wouldn&rsquo;t have written language, and without written language we would not have typography.</p>
<p>Agriculture did indeed lead to our ancestors suffering through millenia of toil and tyranny. But it made the societies that practiced it militarily stronger than those which did not, and so it spread as the result of the way things happen rather than any considered human choice. (cf. <em>The Parable of the Tribes</em> by Andrew Bard Schmookler)</p>
<p>We cannot change the past, but we can make use of the technologies we have now, the upside of agriculture, to bring about a world with a decent life for every human being.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Russell: <em>anyone can go back to a subsistence hunter-gatherer life at anytime &hellip; The thing is, if you do that, that is all you&rsquo;ll ever have time to do.</em></p>
<p>Again I have to ask what data you have to back up this assertion, which like your previous one re height is contrary to everything I&rsquo;ve read that anthropologists and palaeontologists have concluded about hunter gatherer societies. Even in the relatively harsh climate of the modern Kalahari, hunter gatherers are observed to spend on average three hours per day obtaining food, which is in effect the only &lsquo;work&rsquo; they do.</p>
<p>And it is not the case that &lsquo;anyone&rsquo; can resume a hunter gatherer life today. Agriculture drives population expansion, requires immense amounts of water and land, and when combined with industrialisation encourages the centralisation of distribution in cities. I already mentioned the pressures on hunter gatherer populations from destruction of wetlands, forestry and pasture land appropriation for agriculture. Simply put, we&rsquo;re now bound to farming. [That said, there are different models of farming, <a href="http://www.polyfacefarms.com/">including some that preserve wetlands and pasture lands</a>.]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to live in what is one of the most abundant natural habitats on the planet, a place where native hunter gatherer societies were able to adopt some of the things that we otherwise associate with agricultural civilisation (among them, slavery) simply because there was so much year-round plenty that they enjoyed something like a surplus economy. From July to November, I eat some form of wild berry or another every day, simply by walking out my front door and picking them off the bushes. But wild game is as difficult to come by here as anywhere else with even low modern densities: hunting can only be done on private land and regulations define the distance one must be from a house or other human inhabited structure.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The USDA last week made a minor non-binding recommendation. In its inter-office newsletter to agency employees, it suggested that those who want to conserve water could simply refrain from eating meat on Mondays.
The idea is part of the worldwide “Meatless Monday” campaign, which the New York Times notes is backed by “thousands of corporate cafeterias, restaurants and schools.” [No doctors!] In the face of a drought, it’s a pragmatic notion. Cornell University researchers estimate that “producing a pound of animal protein requires, on average, about 100 times more water than producing a pound of vegetable protein.”

<p>Yes, there was <em>one</em> notable exception in history. But it wasn&rsquo;t just the Victorian Era colonial empires, or Spain, France, and England in the new world that ran roughshod over indigenous people.</p>
<p>Ancient Egypt and Babylon grew by conquering neighboring indigenous people. Ancient Rome conquered many barbarians in addition to other civilized societies.</p>

I guess I am having great trouble with John&rsquo;s insistence of Hunter-gatherer tribes as the only way to go.  It is a bit My-way-or-the-highway thinking.  Those who lived by a friendly sea fished;those who had little access to enough wildlife farmed; most had a mixed bag of &ldquo;Eat whatever you have available at the time&rdquo;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ John. The world is full of data and it&rsquo;s often just a click away. Data multiplies like farmers in a good crop year. But time does not. You can accept or reject what every you like.</p>
<p>Talk of the wholesome life of our hunter and gather ancestors is often overly sentimental and, I&rsquo;d suggest a some what fanciful interpretation of what little is known. People have always been people, both good and bad. In any event, that was then. This is now. we aren&rsquo;t going back there any time soon - unless we screw things up very, very badly.</p>
<p>The conversation about a sustainable food supply today with today&rsquo;s population is a different one.</p>
