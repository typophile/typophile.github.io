    Feder und Stichel materials. See if you can get some pics of early humanistic
    types. You might find contextual alternates...  See you soon.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I ran out of time and didn't get to to see the Feder und Stichel materials!
    Ack! But it was a good trip all the same. Some of the material I shot there will
    be in my talk for sure!\r\n\r\nBut I know I will have to go back now. Did you
    know they have the press proofs for the Spiral type as well as original Spiral
    type there?"
