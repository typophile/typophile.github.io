  anywhere near complete so really all i&#39;m looking for is suggestions on what
  to do next.  <BR> <BR>Thanks CK  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1528.gif"

  body: ' Yeah, I&#39;m with Hrant, the outline is cure.  <BR>If you release this
    for free you can be sure it&#39;ll end up on some taco bell advertising or something
    like that <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
    <BR> <BR>I like the way you seperate the p and q by tapering them differently,
    nice touch. <BR> <BR>Overall, nice, quirky typeface. Do some more characters!

  body: wow! thanks for the positive feedback! I think i&#39;m actually going to try
    and finish this thing now. Here&#39;s some of the revised characters and a quick
    toying around with the idea of making a shadow version. And please, be as picky
    as possible. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1530.gif"

    Ralph Bakshi -- and I mean that as a compliment.... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a fun design, and I think it would even be marketable.
    I can see ITC, Lettraset or Image Club &#40;or whatever name they&#39;re going
    by now&#41; carrying this.... <BR> <BR>And definitely, include the shadow version.
    It adds to the flavor and versatility of the family. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' Hi Colin, <BR> <BR>I like your Ebin font but you came here for critique
    so I&#39;ve got some for ya! <BR> <BR>I can see how you built part of the font
    based on duplicating the stems to make all the ascenders but I feel it is the
    wrong direction to take this face. <BR> <BR>This type design has a quirky inconsistancy
    to it that should be enhanced, not normalized or homogenized. I would say put
    all the letters you&#39;ve got on one print out and you&#39;ll see very easily
    which ones could use some tweaking to be more expressive and playful. <BR> <BR>Of
    the glyphs I would say there are a few that could use a redo g, k, s, and v. Also
    the x could use a little more weight on one end. <BR> <BR>Once the base font is
    mastered, go nuts with the other versions of the font. <BR> <BR>Also, even if
    it is free, take the time to develop the uppercase, numbers and some symbols for
    this font. You&#39;ll kick yourself later for not learning more from this experiment.
    <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t wait to see the results! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' thanks for the feedback Stuart, i think you&#39;re right about taking it
    another step to make it more unique. And David, i&#39;m impressed, you picked
    out the Ren and Stimpy influence with ease. Before i began my education as a graphic
    designer i was obsessed with animation and of course Spumco&#39;s stuff. When
    i started designing this font it kind  naturally took that direction and i went
    with it &#40;note the ren like g&#41;. <BR> <BR>thanks again, CK '
