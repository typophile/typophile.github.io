  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">An interesting topic was raised yesterday on the Typophile Chat: some Latin-American users complained about the high member fees for ATypI, and asked if it would be conceivable to have cheaper fees for -in their own words- &quot;development countries&quot;. <BR> <BR>I think this concern is valid. Could it be possible to couple the fee (and other member fees in general) to the Gross National Income or Mean Income or whatever you call this in English? I don't mind paying more than someone from Argentina, as I probably earn more too. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A couple of things need to be noted. The financial model under which ATypI operates is not all that different from that under which our Argentinian friends find themselves. It is not a wealthy association: it struggles to make sure that costs are covered from one year to another, very rarely manages to produce a surplus, is almost entirely driven by volunteer efforts. Membership fees are basically the only way in which the association can pay for its activities between annual conferences. Personally, I think it will be necessary for membership fees to be increased in order to improve the operational effectiveness of the association. <BR> <BR>At the same time, I would love to be able to make the benefits of membership available to more people. One option that springs to mind (and which David Earls has also raised) is to develop affiliate relations with sister organisations (either national or regional) that would provide a means for more regular exchange of information between ATypI and type professionals who are not members but who may belong to sister organisations. So, for example, an Argentinian type association with its own membership rules and fees, might enter into such a relationship with ATypI, so that there would be a point of contact between Argentinian designers and ATypI. We would need to explore the ways in which this relationship could be mutually exploited, to ensure that members of both organisations benefit. It would also be necessary to establish guidelines for organisation structures, goals and activities to ensure that relations are only established with organisations that share ATypI's goals. If people think this is worth exploring, I could take the question to the ATypI board. <BR> <BR>It would be interesting to know what kind of type or design associations exist in Argentina, as an example case.</div>

Keep the organizing group small, use a Typophile SIG (maybe one public and another private) to coordinate, agree on a simple &quot;solution&quot;, and if you can do it under the auspices of your ADG or something, better.

		<div class="commentbody">I really don't see why ATypI should loose resources just because it has especial fees to &quot;less rich&quot; countries members. <BR> <BR>Of all the benefits I can read on the ATypI website, people like me (living in Latin America) could use only the virtual ones, like the member area of the website, or the mailing list. I think there's no exceptional costs in this, for the organisation, I mean, this is not as expensive as organising a conference outside. <BR> <BR>I'll not ask ATypI to pay me my airplane ticket to any conference, or even the fee to be there. It's just to be part (a minimal part if you prefer) of a group of people interested in typography and design, who share information and opinions about this subject. <BR> <BR>I think a fee between US$30 and US$50, would be more attainable to us (since the regular student fee is about US$20 it's not so fictitious to think about it, isn</div>

May be (if we consider it interesting and profitable) we'll have some relationship&quot;.</i> <BR> <BR>This is not at all what I am suggesting. I was very clear that the relationship is not between rich and poor 'clubs' but between an international association and national and regional organisations. This proposal is in no way limited to developing countries or countries in financial crisis. I think it is a model that could be usefully applied to all kinds of countries in which there are interested and committed individuals who are willing to form associations and, through those associations, interract both directly and through ATypI with associations in other countries. There are already many countries with graphic design and/or specifically typographic associations, and these can and should provide a point of contact among designers internationally. The benefit of such national associations is that they can set membership fees suitable to the internal financial situations of the countries in which they operate. Regardless of whatever steps ATypI might be able to take to make it easier for designers in all countries take part, I don't think an international association can fully take the place of local and national organisations. Elsebra mentioned some of the problems of the ADG. Is there any 'grassroots' movement to take control of the ADG, to manage it better? or perhaps to create a new association, perhaps less formally structured that can respond more creatively to the situation of designers in Argentina today? <BR> <BR>Having said all that, I'm very happy to explore with my fellow ATypI board members ways in which the membership could be opened to our colleagues who cannot afford the current, 'one size fits all' membership fee. I do think it is important, and I would not want to deny the possibility without examining the potential impact for good or ill on the association's finances. There is no question that the impact would be for the good in all other things; this is only a practical (how do we do it?) and financial (how will it affect our income and expenses?) issue. Hrant's suggestion of indexing fees to national economic indicators, while untypical, is not a bad way for an international association to proceed, so long as the average does not represent a decline in current revenues. The fact that such economic indicators are regularly published electronically suggests that the pricing could be semi-automated and set by ATypI for each year. Obviously, the number of current, renewing and potential new members each year needs to be factored into such calculations: ten new members from the USA is going to have a very different impact on ATypI's finances than ten new members from Bangladesh. <BR> <BR>In response to Jean-Fran</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; so long as the average does not represent a decline in current revenues <BR> <BR>I think it wouldn't, for the simple reason that very few people from economically troubled regions are currently members anyway!

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Stephen: let's please not shoot the messenger here. <BR> <BR>Just a quickie to support Hrant's theory: <BR>A bridge was built, connecting Paradise Island to Nassau in the Bahamas. In order to recoup the construction costs and maintenance, the companies that built it decided to ask people $2 to cross the bridge from one island to the other. <BR>After a certain amount of time, those companies notice that they're actually losing money. First they intend to close down the bridge, but instead they lower the fee to $1. Since then, the bridge is economically viable: for that amount of money, using an alternative simply is not worth it anymore. <BR> <BR>Y <BR> <BR>PS You might ask yourself (and with good reason): is he on drugs?

		<div class="commentbody">It would be fairest to index all membership fees to economic indicators for members' countries of residence. With access to such indicators, this is potentially easier than trying to divide the world into vaguer economic blocks. If the USA is taken as the high water mark, it is clear that the fee for members from that country would need to increase over current levels in order to maintain a balance with adjusted fees for members from other countries. Over time, the system could be finessed, but initially ATypI would need to look at it's current membership and work out a scale that produces an average fee suitable for not only maintaining but improving the operational effectiveness of the association. <BR> <BR>Hm. This could be quite fun. I think I'll pop out and buy a copy of <i>The Economist</i>.</div>
