  If I use a typeface for inspiration, what kind of copyright laws apply?\r\n\r\nThanks

    in the Build section, though I have a feeling they may be more geared towards
    advanced issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book, \"Learn FontLab Fast\" will probably be
    recommended by everyone:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Learn-FontLab-Fast-Leslie-Cabarga/dp/0965762858/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1248915428&sr=8-1\r\n\r\nFontLab
    also has their own support forum where you may find something to help:\r\nhttp://forum.fontlab.com/\r\n"

  body: "<em>Also, If I use a typeface for inspiration, what kind of copyright laws
    apply?</em>\r\n\r\nWell, speaking very broadly, I think that most type designers,
    at one point or another, get inspired by other typefaces. Copying a font's outlines
    would cross the line, however. It's one thing to be inspired or be influenced,
    but there wouldn't be much point in doing a slavish imitation of something that
    already exists.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, we all have to start somewhere, right?
    At first you will likely be influenced by work you admire, but if you keep at
    it you will find your own voice."

    It it an index of features, not a guide to use. It''s an essential reference,
    but agony to learn from. Learn FontLab Fast is a guide to use, and so extremely
    valuable, though it doesn''t go all the that far. '
