body: I've known there's a couple of sites who can make sheets of dry transfer type
  from a layout you send to them, with the same quality as the old letraset sheets,
  plus they make it in the pantone color you choose. It's great for such a lot of
  things as making comps on the real paper/material you're going to use, texts directly
  applied on walls/panels, etc. The drawback is not only that it's not cheap, but
  moreover the large amount of time they need to prepare and deliver it to you. Does
  anyone know if there's any chance for a do-it-yourself? I suppose it must be some
  kind of photographic process, but i dunno if it's necessary any complex equipment
  one can't afford all by himself...

    a true DIY approach, but a product that you run through a laser printer."

    you, laser printer decal papers are available for less than one US dollar per
    sheet.

  body: "3M used to manufacture  photosensitive do-it-yourself dry transfer sheets
    in black and white. You prepared a negative, exposed the sheet to UV light, then
    used a chemical solution to wash off the unexposed areas. Upside: instant dry-transfer
    lettering; downside: you had to buy a whole box and at least a quart (IIRC) of
    developed.\r\n\r\nOf course, this was Once Upon a Time\u2026"

  body: The process must be as oldnick says, and the waste of material the reason
    for the high prices... I dunno the printer decal papers HVB says, I'll check out,
    and the decalpro machine found by jabez seems really interesting and worth of
    investigation... Thank you all! But if anyone works in Collodoc, Paris, and can
    tell me how they do it...
