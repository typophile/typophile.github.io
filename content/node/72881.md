    "T". '

  body: It was on a boat we got this spring and I had thought it was a J - "Dads Joy"
    - but easily could be Toy? - scraped it off today to rename, so no longer a question
    other than historical. Previous owners not known so couldn't ask them.  Thanks
    for the responses.

  body: I'm not really answering the question, sorry, but I don't think someone would
    call his new boat a toy, so probably it is a 'J'.
