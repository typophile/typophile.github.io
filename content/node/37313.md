  main typesetting/layout program? I have been using Adobe's Indesign for like 4 years
  now and i'm pretty comfy and settled with it as it gives total control over type
  features. I cannot see any other software atm that matches it, even newest of Quarks,
  imho.\r\n\r\nAnd if anyone has made the upgrade to version CS3 of Indesign, is it
  that much of a revolution over CS2?, considering that i need to upgrade to an intel-based
  Mac for the program to run smoothly or whatever...\r\n "

  body: "Since I work on InDesign, I'm not going to give my subjective opinions. However,
    I can say that version CS3 is basically the same speed as CS2 on the same machine.
    The Intel Macs do run faster than PPC Macs, so it appears as if InDesign CS3 runs
    \"smoother\" on them, but you won't see much difference on the same machine.\r\nThe
    new features are listed at http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/upgrade/ . \r\nSome
    text-related details that aren't called out are: CS3 handles OpenType mark positioning
    and justification of marks better than CS2 and composed Unicode works better --
    these help Vietnamese and Thai. We also improved our handling of some obscure
    polytonic Greek details."

  body: "I have recently started using InDesign CS3 at work (CS2 at home).\r\nI haven't
    found many standout features yet \u2013\_this is probably because so far I am
    just using in in the same old way ... I'm sure there are some major advances I
    haven't found (and may never find), but it's only been a few weeks.\r\n\r\nI prefer
    the new interface in the CS3 versions of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign (Illustrator
    hasn't changed as much as the others).\r\n\r\nCS3 runs fine on older PPC Macs,
    it's 'Universal' so it runs natively on both PPC and Intel. \r\nI'm using a 3.5-year-old
    PowerBook (1GB RAM) and it works perfectly.\r\nFrom friends I have talked with,
    the main reason to upgrade is if you already have an Intel Mac, because CS2 runs
    like a dog on them.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you need to persuade someone that you <em>need</em>
    a new Intel Mac then I'll keep quiet ... "

    clients don't have it yet.\r\n\r\nBut I'm still using Quark too - in fact no fewer
    than 4 of my current clients insist on it. It's still the lingua franca of book
    publishing altho some have switched over to InDesign."

    choose Indesign over Quark because I didn\u2019t especially like the Quark interface
    when I tried it, because it\u2019s the only app my school teaches and that some
    of my professors even know how to use, and because I almost never see a job listing
    that demands Quark experience exclusively."

  body: Originally I decided on InDesign because it was able to handle both PageMaker
    and Quark files, and couldn't afford to buy them both. I never liked Quark anyway.
    I've especially enjoyed CS2 (haven't tried CS3 yet). I'm looking forward to the
    upgrade, the table and cell styles sound tempting.

    allows me to see both the strengths and the weaknesses of both. I wish InDesign
    had kerning tables but I need to learn nested styles, I think that seems like
    a great tool. I wish Quark let you really lock objects and guides.\r\n\r\nI use
    Quark's keyboard shortcuts in InD which made the transition much easier but it
    still feels like I'm speaking two languages, constantly translating from one to
    the other even tho the apps are more similar than different."

    as CS2.\r\n\r\nFor testing the fonts I make I use InDesign CS2 and CS3 by preference,

    to define OT features and verify they work properly.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: I originally had Quark 3.31 on a Mac LC, back in the "old" days, and loved
    it--in fact, I still have it on that computer and occasionally use it. The program
    was very intuitive. But of course you know what happened to Quark, and eventually
    I switched to InDesign CS on my G3 so that I could have updated typesetting features
    that Quark wasn't offering yet. After Quark 3.31, InDesign seemed like some Microsoft
    program--clunky as all get out. I still haven't got totally comfortable with it
    after three years of daily use. I might just go back to Quark. Hopefully InDesign
    CS3 is better. The printers I use accept either Quark or InDesign, and most now
    prefer pdf anyway.

  body: "I don't care for InDesign - cause I guess I'm just an old dog that doesn't
    want new tricks. I've been with Quark from the beginning as a Beta and sometimes
    a Gamma tester. Works for me - and my printer enjoys the files too. I have only
    one customer who demanded I make new mechanicals for them in InDesign - so I bought
    the CS (haven't upgraded to even 2 yet!) and worked my buns off for them. Fortunately
    their printer still accepts Quark, and had even upgraded to Quark 7 - so he and
    I get along fine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Meanwhile Patty</strong>: <em>I wish Quark let
    you really lock objects and guides.</em>\r\nCan't help you lock objects by guides
    really do lock these days. Quark now gives you, what we once paid for, XPert Tools
    - among them is XPert Guides - real easy - pull your guide to where you want it
    - click on it twice - lock it in - and if you are like me, change the green to
    blue... \r\n\r\nAnd you know, giving ems and strongs - is the closest I've come
    to old fashioned typesetting to date..."

  body: "I'm using InDesign CS3 and I think the improved UI is worth the upgrade price.
    In previous versions of InDesign, I always felt like the UI was struggling to
    become something really useful, but wasn't getting there. Now, it really works
    nicely.\r\n\r\nI use the ME version, because I need to do Arabic and Hebrew work.
    I'm also using Tom Milo's Tasmeem plug-in, which is my current favourite typesetting
    tool. Very, very cool."

  body: In Grade 6 I started typing school projects on my Mom's three-ton L.C. Smith
    manual typewriter. Often I experimented with narrower columns of type pushed to
    one side, with drawings, etc., in the space created. Page numbers I'd embellish
    with coloured pencils with a graphic suitable to the topic. More effort usually
    went into the design of my projects than the research. I'd spend two weeks designing
    a cover and one night actually writing the text. For Christmas in my last year
    of high school I got my own typewriter---a Smith-Corona manual portable. With
    that I figured I had university beat hands down! How times have changed!

  body: Ye Olde Compugraphic Power Page system was hard to beat. It used a modified
    flavor of SGML code, which made learning HTML subsequently a snap. And it had
    some features which even the best WYSIWYG layout programs lack today, including
    Auto-Tabs and precisely-controllable vertical justification.

  body: "For those who haven't upgraded from InDesign CS2 to CS3, the major new feature
    -- IMO -- is the Table and Cell Styles. They're still not perfect, but they add
    a whole new layer to production of table-heavy documents. For documents that I
    need to keep in CS2 format for some reason, I often build all the tables in CS3,
    then break the links to the styles and export the document to INX, then re-import
    into CS2: perfect tables in much less time.\r\n\r\nCS3 runs peachy on my PPC G5,
    btw. In my experience, it's CS2 on Intel Macs that is the \"problem child.\""

    Compugraphics masters were either 6 pt or 24 pt (which ever they were, Merganthaler
    was the other) so all point sizes were blown up or reduced from that master. What
    made Alphatype so wonderful is that they had several digital versions of the same
    face in different sizes - so when you chose say, 32 pt - you were getting it from
    a 36 pt master - or closer to the look of the original hot metal face...\r\n\r\nAhhhh\r\n\r\nI
