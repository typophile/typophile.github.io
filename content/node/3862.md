    you can manage to pay attention to him, at least when it comes to friggin' Greek

    would have had more to say about why various factions preferred different angles.
    Rather than discuss that topic, he used the opportunity to take a patronizing
    shot at my typeface, as if I were one of his students. He didn't reply to my rationale.

    me up with your \"artiste\" bullshit, Hrant. On reviewing the thread I see that
    Gerry had in fact initially taken the time to make a number of informative points
    about the the angle of the tonos, but it's not tactful to speak to an established
    designer as if he's one of your students. I don't have any beef with Gerry, only
    with you.\r\n\r\nI thought his comment about the two tumblers and the soft pencil
    was rather amusing. Perhaps when I repeated it, I should have put the happyface
    emoticon after it.  \r\n\r\n"
