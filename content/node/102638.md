  body: "Mid Victorian style. Not certain if typefaces or engraved. Three styles.
    Top & bottom lines seem to match a widely used 19th century typeface -- Lightface
    Celtic. You can decide for yourself based on the attached specimen of the full
    character set.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LghtFaceCeltic@PhillipsOTTBp16@20percent_3715.jpg]\r\nI
    can't find a digitized font that matches, but there may be something under another
    name.\r\nAs for the fancy font, again I can't find a digital match. The base font
    is sometimes called Roman Rimmed. \r\nThe Roman is a somewhat more nuanced version
    of the Fatface fonts of the early 19th century, of which several are digitized,
    e.g. Normande.\r\nRimmed refers to the fine line around the core of the font.\r\nThe
    fill of horizontal lines was a fairly common technique. The use of two sets of
    lines makes it an interesting variation.\r\nThe fancy font could be made as a
    bespoke font.\r\nDon\r\n "

    body: "Barcelona could be modified for an approximate match of Lightface Celtic.
      \r\nReplace Barcelona's Latin serifs, expand the width, moderate the curl in
      C and e, revise R and N, and use a simpler ampersand.\r\nDon\r\n"

      portion of the label. The swashes are a nice bonus. \r\nDon"
