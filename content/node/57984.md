  body: "Two problems:\r\n\r\n1: Your writing implement metaphor is inconsistent.
    Your 'C' looks like a brush stroke, while your 'h' looks like a broad nip pen
    stroke.\r\n\r\n2: Your ductus is inconsistent. Let's say you decide on a broad
    nip pen metaphor, then how do you hold it, in what angle do you write (stress
    axis), with which speed and with what amount of contrast modulation?"

    be their logo, btw. I'm just playing. Thank you Clauses. Those are good points.
    I guess the ending of the C mess up quite a lot."

    Believe me, I painfully experience the limits of my knowledge every day. ;-p ;\xB7D\r\nBut
    what I <em>do</em> know is that there are more than 2 typophiles in Oslo:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com/user/%20oslo\r\n"

  body: I'm left-handed and hold my pen in a really weird way (have since kindergarten),
    but I realized if I did hold my pen the proper way that they teach in school (between
    the thumb and forefinger), it would probably slant to the left. My grandfather
    could write with both hands, probably since he was naturally left-handed but grew
    up in the days when you'd get beat for using your left hand.
