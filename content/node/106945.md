  I've seen it in a number of places but first noticed it as the logo for the British
  comic Zenith's logo. I think it may just be Adobe Illustrator brush strokes but
  wanted to make sure.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nUses:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_(comics)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zenith_book_1_4404.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/zenith_book_2_6112.jpg]\r\n\r\nSimilar
  font here....might be the same?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PK167_3988.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

    as all repeating letters are different. [[http://artandsignstudio.com/xtremescript.html|Xtreme
