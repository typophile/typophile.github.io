  lettering. It's been suggested that I study the history and evolution of scripts,
  from how they descended from italics and the flexible reed pen, to how swashes change
  over the centuries. I'm currently reading \"The History and Technique of Lettering\"
  by Alexander Nesbitt, which I'm really enjoying. However, the book covers a ton
  of information in a fairly short amount of pages, and there are some ares which
  I'd like to explore in depth. One being the history of Dutch writing master Jan
  van den Velde.\r\n\r\nI've been searching the web, but so far I haven't found any
  books that go in depth on scripts, so I come to you. Does anyone know of any good
  resources to look into? Also, does anyone know where I can find a copy of \"Spieghel
  der schrijfkonste, in den welcken ghesien worden veelderhande gheschrifften met
  hare fondementen ende onderrichtinghe\"?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    ones that have fallen into the public domain. There are also books on the history
    of writing itself as well.\r\n\r\nThus, there is \"The Origin and Progress of
    Writing\", from 1784; one of several online copies is here:\r\n\r\n[[https://archive.org/details/cu31924029487141]]\r\n\r\nwhich

    has started basing itself on fonts (because metal type did not lend itself to

      now is, do you know of any resources (preferably books) that visually describe
      the evolution of lettering? Any books on the techniques of hand lettering (not
      calligraphy) would also be greatly appreciated!"

    long out of print so not cheap, but not outrageous. Could be exactly what you
    want as it's like a more academic version of Nesbitt. I am impressed by its depth.\r\n\r\nSee

    noticed you're from Oakland\u2014are you teaching any classes in the area? Or
    know of any good typography/design programs? I'm moving to San Francisco soon
    and have a few weeks off, and would really like to spending that time learning
    (I come from a computer science background). Thanks!"

  body: "Still, although calligraphy, lettering, and handwriting long precede type,
    fairly quickly type became so dominant that writing hands ended up taking their
    inspiration from typefaces instead of typefaces taking their inspiration from
    writing hands, I would suspect.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was a thread here where
    evidence that Baskerville and/or Bodoni got their inspiration from writing hands
    which preceded them was discussed."

  body: "Well, typography can indeed be defined as writing with characters that have
    been made in advance. But then, so can typing.\r\n\r\nI think that while it is
    limiting to insist that all typography should look like calligraphy, it's still
    a fruitful source of inspiration. I believe that ductus <em>is</em> an aid to
    legibility and readability, and that unlimited creative freedom without constraint
    can often leave people not knowing where to start, or creating things so extravagant
    that they are not found useful.\r\n\r\nHowever, new ideas have to start somewhere,
    and so a first try that is not a success can inspire someone in the future to
    something that does work.\r\n\r\nRather than being wishy-washy, I think I'm trying
    to make a definite point here: there is a definite place for both the traditionalist
    and the experimental schools of type design; both are needed."
