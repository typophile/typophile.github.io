body: This is my question that came out of the &#34;Display vs Text&#34; thread restated
  here to avoid hijacking the other thread. <BR> <BR>There have been studies of legibility
  for signage, CRT, long text. Studies comparing serif to sans serif where one wins
  for long text and the other for screen or when reversed or for signage. I am curious
  if anyone is aware of the parameters of studies and can speak to where one kind
  of reading begins and the other ends. Clearly reading &#34;War and Peace&#34; is
  in the long text arena. Clearly reading a Stop sign is not. But where is the break
  point? Is it &#34;The Old Man and the Sea,&#34; a simple brochure, a paragraph,
  an entry in the phone book, or any word longer than 8 characters? Also, how much
  of a difference is there? If I read &#34;War and Peace&#34; will it take me a day
  longer if it were set in a Sans instead of a Serif or only an hour? What if I only
  read 20 pages a night of it? If it all boils down to 10 minutes difference to read
  &#34;The Old Man and the Sea,&#34; then what is the big deal?  <BR>I have heard
  a few people &#40;and only from type savvy people&#41; say reading a Sans really
  impairs their reading a great deal. Frankly, I don&#39;t find any difference in
  my own reading. The average lay person just reads without making much of a consious
  judgement.  <BR>I wonder how much of it is a self fulfilling prophesy or even something
  as simple as we like one over the other only for aesthetic reasons and therefore
  our self-percieved reading ability increases.  <BR>My real question or actually
  theory is that years of legibility/readability studies surely measure something
  but what? I have never seen a conclusion in a study sufficiently explain the &#34;why&#34;
  aspect. There are just too many leaps of faith from &#34;Serifs help us read faster&#34;
  to &#34;how they do it&#34; There was a time when the greatest scientific minds
  on the Earth were convinced that the world was flat or the Sun traveled about the
  Earth. Later someone else figured it out and proved them wrong. Is that where we
  are now with readability/legibility? Will someone prove us all wrong in a few years?  <BR>

  body: When I invent some hypothesis of legibility, generally it is based on the
    analyses that I make to other typographies, and not in books. In books one i can
    find contradictory and not very believable theories. I prefer to analyze the phenomenons
    for myself, and later I investigate to see who is supporting my theories. But
    I prefer speak it with other colleagues typographers instead of professing theory
    of books. <BR> <BR>Constantly I am making operation tests and graphic analysis
    that can supplement my proposals.   <BR>In general I analyze the Dutch types,
    especially fonts of Gerard Unger, DTL, Ensched

  body: 'The problem with legibility studies is that there are too many variables
    to draw definitive conclusions. <BR> <BR>Especially problematic are the cultural
    factors. To take an extreme example, suppose you have grown up in the West and
    are ignorant of Asian languages. Say you want to learn Korean. The fonts that
    will work best for you are not likely to be the same ones that work best for an
    adept in the eastern literati tradition. <BR> <BR>Next, how do you scientifically
    measure the artfulness of the designer? If you are like me, there are some typefaces
    that you have gotten to know and can use pretty well, whereas others are like
    foreign tongues. To truly compare the legibility of typefaces you would need a
    sort of '

    studies shouldn&#39;t try to prove that any single font is &#34;the best&#34;
    - that would be ludicrous. But what they can do -of you listen carefully- is tell
    you what can be better, in what contexts. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Okay, I think I can see this from your point of view, perhaps. I can see that
    you could, for example, tack up the same words in two different faces and walk
    to the other side of the room and say, I can make out the one on the right but
    not the one on the left. So if you limit your field of investigation sufficiently
    and define your focus group &#40;so to speak&#41; with some rigor, I suppose you
    could get some results that might be useful to someone. &#40;For my own purposes,
    however, nothing I&#39;ve seen has been very helpful.&#41;

  body: Hrant, if you read my first post you will see it is explicitly against typographic
    panacea. But I&#39;ve talked too much -- time to give someone else a turn. I&#39;ll
    check back in a day or two.
