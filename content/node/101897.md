body: "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\r\n\r\nLONDON (Reuters) \u2014 In response to grassroots
  outrage against the lowercase \"t\" in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Avant_Garde\">Avant
  Garde type-font</a>, the Coexist Foundation (www.coexistfoundation.net) has launched
  a competition to amend two letters in said type-font, in order to promote better
  understanding between Jews, Christians, Muslims, Christians and Jews.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAccording
  to Isabella Ward of the Coexist Foundation:\r\n\u2022 Competition entrants may replace
  any two letters with a crescent and a Star of David, in both lowercase and uppercase
  forms.\r\n\u2022 The letter \"K\"/\"k\" however must be left intact.\r\n\u2022 In
  the further spirit of fairness the uppercase \"T\" must be modified to have the
  vertical element project above the horizontal element.\r\n\u2022 In the Italic styles
  the \"T\", \"t\" and new letter shapes must remain upright, in order to avoid a
  skewed view of religion.\r\n\u2022 No shapes from the tainted type-font Bookshelf
  Symbol 7 may be re-used.\r\n\u2022 Consultation with Herb Lubalin is optional but
  encouraged.\r\n\u2022 The competition entry fee is in the form of a modest tithe
  of 10% of year 2012 income.\r\n\u2022 The winner of the competition will be awarded
  10,000 blessings.\r\n\r\nThe Coexist Foundation competition has attracted controversy
  however. Type-font designer Matthew Margarinck has voiced his opposition to \"spec
  work\", the practice of providing servicing with no guarantee of compensation. Margarinck
  states: \"Although it is unfortunate that Avant Garde exhibits a provocative Christian
  cross where the second-most-frequent English letter should reside, it remains that
  speculation is contrary to all major religions.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever no controversy
  has arisen concerning any possible impact on the legibility of the resultant type-font.
  According to attorney Nick Femurr this is because Avant Garde is already impossible
  to read.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate submissions to the competition, the Coexist
  Foundation has produced a \u201Cbefore & after\u201D sample showing one possible
  approach:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abrilmeg_6073.gif]\r\n\r\nRepresentatives
  from Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Shinto, Jainism and Zoroastrianism were
  unavailable for comment.\r\n\r\nhsp"
