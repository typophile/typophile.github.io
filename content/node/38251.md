  really distressed like the way it is shown or if this is a Photoshop trick. I immediately
  thought \"CSA Images\" but not there.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grot_3542.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for helping,\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Stephen, you're thinking of [[http://www.ahleman.com/indexgraphics.html|Andrew
    Leman]]'s [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/ephemera/|E-phemera]] foundry. This
    sample made me think of him too but I couldn't find a match. (I recently bought
    his fonts Fred and Hadank, nice stuff.)
