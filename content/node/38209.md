  body: What if you put it in the liga-feature? This is on by default, and since it
    is raw code we are talking about here, I guess it could be possible to specify
    anything there, not just ligatures.

  body: In general, in InDesign, you can set your defaults by choosing them when nothing
    is selected -- with a document open you're setting the document defaults, or you
    can choose OpenType features to be on by default in a no-documents-open state
    which will copy these defaults to all new documents.  However, I would recommend
    a style-sheet based workflow. There is a related [[http://typophile.com/node/38181|thread
    about OpenType features]] going today as well.

    InDesign and Photoshop - as recommended in the OpenType spec.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
