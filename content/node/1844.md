    in action. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;m still in school -- I&#39;m a senior in a small
    public New England high school.  I&#39;ve never taken a class in graphic design
    or anything of the sort, so I can&#39;t remember quite <i>why</i> I fell in love
    with fonts, but I certainly have. <BR> <BR>-- Liana

  body: Me, Hrant?  No -- it&#39;s an old Internet alias of mine, from another fandom.  I
    created it when I was about twelve, in a fandom where such names were the style.  I
    never meant to keep using it, but it blurred with icons, which blurred with typography.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a bit embarrassed at my presumption whenever I think of the supposed
    surname, so I tend to go by just Liana.  Problem is, as soon as I register with
    that, about a dozen more Lianas pop up -- it&#39;s not a dreadfully uncommon name.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m reluctant to relinquish the Goldenquill, though -- I suppose
    it does tend to stick in one&#39;s head, and I&#39;d hate to start over again
    with a new name now. <BR> <BR>-- Liana

    our  <BR>History &#43; Evolution of Typography course should  <BR>consist of viewing
    slides and lectures instead of a  <BR>studio course of drawing and cutting out
    actual letter  <BR>forms. No way to learn type IMO. <BR> <BR>Typophile has always
    provided a great resource.

  body: So how many semesters of typography does your design study program has? How
    are they oriented?&#40;history, edition, design, etc&#41; <BR> <BR>Mine has none,
    we studied type on the fifth semester, as part of the &#34;Editorial Design&#34;
    course. Very dissapointing of course.

    It is taught in a bizarre manner. We  <BR>only have one &#40;final&#41; semester
    of &#34;type design&#34;, but that  <BR>also includes type history and classification.
    In one  <BR>whole 16 week semester, including holidays. Up until <BR>then it is
    just learning composition. I think it is a silly  <BR>way of teaching, because
    to learn the history,  <BR>classification, and design in one semester is too late
    <BR>and not enough. It isn&#39;t really enough to foster a  <BR>broad, cohesive
    knowledge of type and typography. <BR>And our tutors seem to actively encourage
    font piracy, <BR>and get quite shirty when I ask whether they paid for  <BR>their
    fonts. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any tutors who encourage ethics <BR>in type? '

  body: Many people at my school are uneducated about type ethics, and there&#39;s
    a good ammont of font piracy that goes on behind the scenes. My professor&#39;s
    don&#39;t LIKE it, but they don&#39;t really make it a point to discourage it,
    they just seem to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist. <BR> <BR>Most people I know &#34;do
    not see the value&#34; &#40;their words, not mine&#41; in paying $150 for a font
    file that&#39;s less than 1mb. In most cases, there&#39;s no advantage in paying
    for a font licence opposed to just copying a file off a computer. Ethics? These
    people do not CARE about ethics, most of them are broke and are just trying to
    get through school. <BR> <BR>If you think about it, there really isn&#39;t any
    kind of reward for purchasing fonts legimately. <BR> <BR>Fonts not copy protected,
    and have no serial numbers/keys &#40;like when buying photoshop, quark, etc&#41;.
    Many younger students in the program don&#39;t even realize fonts/font licences
    have to be PURCHASED. <BR> <BR>Typographers complain about font piracy, but foundaries
    have done little to stop it, or promote ethical behavior. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    my opinion anyway.

  body: Yeah, I worded that a little awkwardly. <BR> <BR>What i mean is, for students,
    there&#39;s no positive renforcement for purchasing font licences vs. piracy.
    <BR> <BR>If i buy illustrator or freehand legitimately, I get a manual, installation
    CDs, etc. I can use my serial number to register and recieve updates, techincal
    support, etc. People who have pirated copies don&#39;t get these materials. <BR>
    <BR>Granted, purchasing a type family is different than purchasing software .
    . . hmm, now that i think about it that statement of mine IS really ambiguous.
    I appologize. When I think of a better explanation, I&#39;ll post it. <BR> <BR>sorry
