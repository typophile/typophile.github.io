  its identity to me! The only thing I know about this is 'concepts' is written in
  brush script i believe, but its the 'Red Hot' section which has me scratching my
  head.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\nThanks"

    Oriental, OrientNouveau</strong> by WSI fonts collection\r\n<strong>Pittoresk</strong>
    by Brendel Informatik\r\n\r\nWSI & Brendel companies are both well known for their
    rip-offs, therefore if somebody finds a legitimate match, I will remove the above
    font names."
