body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm a Win 2000/FontLab 4.6 user.  Several years ago, I worked
  with a mac-only type designer to convert his commercial mac PS fonts to PS and TT
  for win.  Font technology has changed drastically since then!\r\n\r\nSome of these
  fonts are based on reverse images [solid-rectangle background with transparent glyphs].
  \ \r\n\r\nWin fully supports a solid-rectangle glyph in the spacebar cell--a very
  cool, intuitive feature to be preserved if possible.\r\n\r\nWhen these fonts were
  first developed c1997, the mac OS in use at the time did not support a spacebar
  glyph.  Experiments crashed the designer's machine.\r\n\r\nNow that OSX [theoretically?]
  supports win-generated TTFs, I'm concerned about spacebar glyphs after reading this
  info:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/30303\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/textfonts/TTRefMan/RM07/appendixB.html\r\n\r\n1)
  Is there a danger that a win-generated TT font with a glyph assigned to the spacebar
  cell would crash an OSX system?\r\n\r\n2) Would PS-favor OT do a better job of supporting
  this glyph than TT?\r\n\r\n3) Is there a FontLab setting, default character or CodePage
  combo for a win/mac solution with spacebar glyph support?  \r\n\r\n4) Is it likely
  that win support for spacebar glyphs will continue in the foreseeable future?\r\n\r\n5)
  In FontLab's Naming dialog, there is an option in the More Styles list labeled \"negative.\"
  \ This term is not defined in the manual.  If I chose it, it does not stay selected.
  \ \r\n\r\nIs it relevant to this kind of font?  If so, how can I use it?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks for your help, Anna\r\n-- \r\nThe Type Heritage Project\r\nHonoring the Genius

  body: "I just tested this on my OSX 10.3 system.  I made a font with a X-shaped
    contour in the space glyph in TTF format, and then installed the font on OSX.
    \ Using TextEdit (the simple text-editor that comes with OSX), I wrote out some
    text and then set it to use the font I'd just made.  It showed the contour that
    I'd put in the space glyph as you would expect, everywhere there was a space character.

    even better than I expected in my Wildest Dreams--seems too good to be true.  Thank
    you for your courage in testing your hypothesis.  \r\n\r\nDid you used FontLab
    to make this test font?  If so, what encoding options did you choose?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your generous input, Anna"
