  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just ran into the following idea and I wonder what you guys think of it.

Create a tool that would allow tracking and kerning a text, but it would also allow sharing the final kerning values with other people. The typeface and the kerning pairs will be submitted into a central "kerning repository", and this repository is going to be openly accessible by everyone else. Then, when someone starts on kerning text set in the same type, he can use the repository entry as a starting point. 

Multiple entries for the same kerning pair can be order based on certain criteria, e.g. give a higher preference to the submissions of a certain user or that with a higher "popularity index".

So it is in its essence <em>a crowd-sourced kerning improvement project</em>.

I am a programmer by trade and this is something that is not going to be that hard to write, so the prototype can be thrown together in a matter of few weeks.

Thoughts or comments ? 

Not considering the implementation details at the moment, does the <em>idea</em> have any practical value ? Or does it solve the problem that does not and will not exist ?

Most of the time we only kern anything obvious - the bigger the copy, the more obvious the kerning issues. It's a good idea - but only if we spent all our time kerning body copy. Which we don't. At least, I don't.

The downside to automating every detail is that designers become complacent and altogether ignorant of spacing issues. Kerning type allows designers to fine tune their abilities to read the space and negative space between forms; Gain greater sensitivity towards the rhythm between shapes and relative color/value - useful skills for any designer.</div>

OK, I was under the impression that it wasn't that common.

> Seriously, what’s wrong with just learning how to kern?

Nothing, I'm all for it. But if there are obvious kerning issues in a specific type that <em>everyone</em> needs to fix, why not automate the process a bit ? An example that actually got me thinking in this direction is a W-e kerning in [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/centaur/fonts/|Centaur]]. It's dead obvious that this pair should've been in the kerning table, but somehow it is not there.

Perhaps I'm seeing things from programmer's perspective - if there's a repetitive task, it's a prime candidate for automation. At the very least you are going to be helping yourself so that you won't need to re-kern things when setting another text using the same font (but, say, on a different workstation).

The other issue you run into with this type of automation is that the character of one face can be completely different from another and require a different kerning formula.      

Might be nice to have a baseline starting point though.

		<div class="commentbody">Sometimes hanging out with type designers -- and programmers -- is extremely frustrating. If only they had to use the products they make. If only they understood that kerning too must be an aesthetic matter.

"Must be" since there is so much bad kerning coming from the designers/programmers, at least from the perspective of those who set text. I'll pass on the look of advertising type -- much of it looks similar to how the (human) models look after going through Photoshop. A case of every mom thinks her child is great?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@phrostbyte64: the idea is not to develop universal kerning formula, it's the opposite - collect a set of manual kerning pairs sorted by the type (and perhaps by the size). At the very least this should allow tackle most obvious kerning issues in popular types.
