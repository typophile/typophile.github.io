  Final Major project. I'm redesigning a book most of you will know; G u l l i v e
  r ' s    T r a v e l s .  I'm choosing a typeface/font, and wanted some advice as
  to what would be best..\r\n\r\nThe story is based in the 1800s, the book reads in
  the first person. Gulliver is educated, has a passion for voyage and shows no Emotion
  - A suitable typeface, in my opinion, would be a Sans Serif, possibly found in Geography
  text books?\r\nAnother option could be - Serif typeface found in Dictionaries from
  the 1800s?\r\nAnother - A readable, monotone, Serif typeface from that period?\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions welcome..\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!"

    not the 1800s. It was published in 1726 (revised 1735). \r\n\r\nHere's the <a
    href=\"http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JSW003_31.jpg\">titlepage
    of the first edition</a>, predictably set in Caslon's types (with perhaps engraved
    letters used for the largest sizes on the page). If you wanted to move away from
    that obvious model, into perhaps something that captures the mid-1700s rationalist
    culture that Swift satirises in the book, consider <a href=\"http://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/new-fournier-bp/\">New
    Fournier BP</a>.\r\n\r\nBTW, your Random Capitalisation is very 18th Century."

    body: 'Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I''ve read the book, and thanks for pointing
      that out. To be precise, the book is set in the late 1600s into the early 1700s.
      Could you explain how ''New Fournier BP'' captures/reflects the mid-1700s rationalist
      culture? I''m not quite sure I see you what you mean, I don''t see Swift''s
      parody for the mid-1700s. '

    \r\n\r\nFirst of all, there aren't very any of \"them.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, \"they\"
    have a lot of varying opinions about \"what's right\" or \"what's best.\" Just
    read these pages. All you'll occasion is \"Well, <cite>I</cite> would have used...\"\r\n\r\nBeyond
    that:\r\n\r\nHere's the analogy. You are a set designer. You want to use an open

    to work? "

    at university for over 40 years. Of course, I've spent the last 30 setting and
    designing books for university presses, but they do care about sales...\r\n\r\nThe
    point about the set analogy is, you don't usually build the production around
    the set. The set designer has to adapt. But if perchance you do build a production
    around the set, don't stop there. It is, after all, a whole."

    doesn't mean nobody else will buy it. There <em>is</em> the content, after all!
    \ :-)  Also, designers don't just buy/acquire things with which they agree; the
    good ones also acquire things they don't agree with (in order to learn) especially
    if other people think it's culturally significant.\r\n\r\nRamping up HVB's idea:
    choose different -but harmonious- fonts for each of Gulliver's voyages. There
    are typeface systems with multiple styles. Hmmm, what about Compatil?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
