body: "Hello Arabic font experts, \r\n\r\nI am working on creating an Arabic version
  of an American corporate logo which uses \"Helvetica Neue 85 Heavy\". I found the
  font \"Neue Helvetica\xAE Arabic Bold\", which matches stylistically. My question
  is...would this font be considered appropriate for a somewhat conservative corporate
  application, or is it considered a more modern face? I have been asked to show both
  a modern and a more traditional example. \r\n\r\nFrom the small amount of research
  I have done on the subject, I have heard mention of Helvetica, Universe and Adobe
  Arabic under the more modern category and fonts such as Emiri, Karim, Amiri and
  Lotus in the more traditional realm? But since I am in unfamiliar territory, I thought
  I would reach out to the type community before proceeding any further.\r\n\r\nI
  would love any modern vs. traditional recommendations that you guys may have, using
  Helvetica Neue 85 Heavy as a stylistic guideline.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelvNeueArabic_Sample_5089.jpg]"

    \ :-/\r\n\r\nLinotype does have an Arabic expert in the person of Nadine Chahine,
    but even her great sensitivity cannot always totally overcome customer expectations...
    and customers are rarely sensitive enough to this topic. What I'm getting at is,
    no matter what the marketing people might tell you the Arabic companions to those
    classic Latin designs are indeed too modern - they don't say the same thing the
    Latin is saying. This doesn't mean you have to go full-on conservative (which
    is likely to backfire, irrespective of any stylistic discord). The good thing
    is you're not designing an entire harmonious typeface! That's a supreme challenge.
    You only need to make a logo. Although I assume you do also need to set extended
    text in Arabic?\r\n\r\nMost of all, the actual nature and intent of the corporation
    you're dealing with will determine what direction to take. You might not be at
    liberty to disclose too much specific information here, but if you could elaborate
    a bit that would help greatly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks you so much for your reply, Hrant.\r\n\r\nYes, I definitely do nor
    want to offend by going to the extreme in either direction. Luckily, all I need
    to typeset is the name of the company and a small tagline. So no need to dive
    in to an entire typeface. True that I am not at liberty to go into too much detail.
    But to give you the general idea, I would like to convey the same feel that Helvetica
    Neue conveys here. Which is, in my view, traditional, clean, classy, slightly
    conservative and corporate...something a financial institution, lawyer, power
    company or high-end retailer may use. By no means cutting edge, but not overly
    official and stuffy either.\r\n"

  body: "So yes, Neue Helvetica Arabic would be way too \"hip\" here. But if you just
    throw in a traditional Arabic style, it would be like an argument at the UN.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    some interesting stuff to contemplate here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/sets/72157626939559953/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
