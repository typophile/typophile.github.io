  letterhead, business cards, etc) do you select a face that pairs well with face
  used in the wordmark? I've always tried to incorporate the logo's type in much the
  same way I would a header but frankly it's becoming restrictive. It's not like they're
  read together or anything. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nTim"
