body: "Dearest Lords and Ladies,\r\n\r\nThis isn't a type ID request, but more of
  a foundry request... Does anyone have any recommendations on a good source(s) for
  Urban/Painted/Graffiti faces? Snowboard/skate punk cultural stuff.\r\n\r\nI know
  there are 10,000 auto-traced beasts out there, and some might even look ok, AND
  one could argue that the \"distressed\" cr*p on the net is emblematic of the culture
  -- but I'm starting a project that will need a reputable foundry with a storefront
  that won't be out of business next year, and faces that won't kill an imagesetter.
  Ideally, the fonts will be Opentype, have contextual and stylistic alternates, and
  still look good.\r\n\r\nI've looked at a couple of sites already, but they've tended
  to be smaller, independent foundries -- not a problem, but I've been burned by purchases
  before.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any recommendations/ideas/notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    know who specializes in fonts by \"real\" graffiti artists. \r\n\r\nBut I'm not
    quite clear on your request. Are you looking for fonts to buy, or a storefront
    for selling your fonts?"

  body: "Sorry, I thought I mentioned that. I'm looking to buy (& use)... and it's
    the type of project (branding) where I will have to refer others (licensees) to
    purchase the fonts as well, in addition to any graphic work we supply (posters,
    logos, etc.)\r\n\r\nI've been cornered in the past by font choices that didn't
    consider that the fonts would have to be available online for others to use; most
    notably, a major studio project that (initially) used ravenscroft, a lovely font
    that has Disney/Haunted Mansion Logos in it (the studio was NOT Disney). Oops.
    \r\n\r\nIn the good old days (15 years ago), I did a lot of custom work along
    these lines - if I needed a particular look, I'd whip something up in Fontographer.
    But even though I have FontLab, I'm a lot rustier than I used to be."

  body: Ok, got it. Can you show me some examples of the kinds of typefaces you're
    seeking?
