  any suggestions? \r\n\r\nAlso a font for the epitome of eclecticism and the avant
  garde movement\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate a modern, updated take for these periods
  though!"

  body: For modern versions of Baroque and Classical styles, Storm Serapion is (very)
    French Baroque and Smeijers' Renard and Arnhem are Dutch Baroque and Neoclassical
    respectively. Indigo Antiqua is subtly eclectic, and Frere-Jones' Nobel in its
    uncondensed light and book weights is a recent take on avant-garde puritanism.

  body: "<em>onsider the original designs for Aldine, Bodoni, Caslon or Garamond</em>\r\n\r\nOf
    these, only Caslon is baroque, but it owes a lot to pre-baroque Dutch oldstyle
    types. The Aldine and Garamond types are renaissance, and Bodoni is romantic.
    For French baroque, you should look at Fournier, not just the types but also how
    he used them in those small format, delicate and ornamented page layouts. For
    Dutch baroque, you should look at Fleischmann and Rosart."

  body: Fleischman and Rosart could equally (more accurately?) be called Dutch transitional
    or rococo, in their addition of newly formalised ornamentation and a tendency
    towards lightness to baroque predecessors. Fournier's usually considered neoclassical,
    though certainly he reinjected a welcome dose of baroque variety into the constructionist
    Romain du Roi. Terminology is not exact, though calling the Aldine (which refers
    to a specific italic designed in 1500) "baroque" does seem rather revisionist.
    Garamond's types were likewise made from 1530 to 1545; and in 1750 Bodoni turned
    10.

    done a lot of baroque or inspired-by-baroque designs as far as I know.

  body: "I agree with chri1753 about Fleischman and Rosart being more Rococo than
    Baroque, and I would put Fournier as well into this class of typefaces. In my
    mind, Rococo is more than a sub-category of late Baroque, since historically the
    former <strong>replaced</strong> the latter, not only in printing and type design,
    but also in architecture, painting, fashion, music and lifestyle.\r\nBy the way,
    Baroque being the style of seventeenth-century <strong>Catholic</strong> Europe,
    I've always found a bit puzzling to read it used for Dutch typography from this
    particular era \u2014 the Netherlands being quite a fiercely Protestant country
    at the time."
