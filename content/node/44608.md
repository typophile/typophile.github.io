  body: "Thanks Coles... I was even thinking it was custom job from FontShop. Hp commissioned
    some stuff from FontShop before (as you might know).\r\n\r\nI love Longhand too.
    The double quotes are not showing up on the fontshop site for this font. \r\n\r\nMikey

    quotes are in there</a>, you just have to add a space after because this font's
    outlines extend beyond their sidebearings.
