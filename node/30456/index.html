<div class=commentbody>Silenta is a wonderful face that looks like a near relative of ITC Korinna. (This face has more of a slab serif feel to it - and reminds me of Rockwell.)
In running your sample letters through WTF - it came up with 5 "similar" fonts -
of which I think if you are looking for a substitute - one of them might actually do the trick -
Eutheric Bold
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/eutheric/bold/
Please remember - this is only similar - not exact.</div>

<div class=commentbody>These are two intertitles from "PATHS TO PARADISE" (1925), starring Raymond Griffith, but I've seen this typeface used in lots and lots of Paramount silents from the early to mid-1920s. I already have Silentina, which is rather different from what I'm looking for, and which came into heavy use with all studios in the mid-to-late '20s.
Thanks for pointing me to Eutheric Bold. It is sorta close; kinda reminds me of a cross between bookman and silentina. It's possible if I try using Eutheric Bold and stretching it a wee bit I might get close.
Anyone else have some suggestions to match the typeface I'm looking for would be much appreciated.

<div class=commentbody><a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/MeyerTwo>Meyer Two</a> from Font Bureau's own incorrigible [[David Berlow]] is based on silent film era lettering. I recall he showed another font at a conference, Rome I think, that was even closer still.

<div class=commentbody>Not a match, by any means, but the thread brought to mind the lettering of Elizabeth Colwell from the early 1920s. Two fonts made from this are Nick Curtis' <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/mckenna-handletter-nf/ target=_blank>McKenna Handletter</a> and Andrew Lehman's <a href=http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html target=_blank>HPLHS Colwell</a>. There's also Fleisch & apostrophe's <a href=http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/lab_colwell.htm target=_blank>Colwell</a> from her earlier (1916) work - but that's even further afield from the type sought.
Thanks, Mark, for catching this ID.
Oh, and props to <a href=http://www.typodermic.com/ target=_blank>Ray Larabie</a> for the nice work on Silentina. Mark, perhaps you could answer a question about the Silentina pair that's been nagging at me. I've got a 1925 BB&S Catalog, so I know that Silentina Movie, including the alternates, was made from Pastel. Any idea where Silentina Film's different capitals come from?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mike - thank you for directing us to HPLHS - I LOVE the prop CD and can use it (alot!) for one of the theatre groups I work with. I've always re-created by hand, taking hours, and not charging them for that labor. What a nice treat this Wednesday morning...</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Any idea where Silentina Film’s different capitals come from?</em>
As a matter of fact, I do.
A guy named Rodney Sauer, a musician who is also involved with restoring silent movies, contacted me about five years ago about identifying the typeface used for the intertitles in a certain film (or series of films, possibly). It turned out to be Pastel, but in some of the samples he had, the caps looked more like Della Robbia.
I did a rough digitization of Pastel for him, but he really wanted the other caps. I said I would see what I could do, but got too busy with other projects and I ended up never finishing it.
Fast-forward two years and Ray Larabie releases Silentina. It turns out that Rodney gave up waiting for me and went to Ray. In the end I think Ray did a decent job of it and I tip my hat to him.</div>

Jackie - Good to see you here. I'm glad that HPLHS link proved so useful. Did you know that Andrew Leman also sells more revival fonts via MyFonts under the <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/ephemera/ target=_blank>Ephemera</a> label? I just purchased his <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/julius-klinger/ target=_blank>Julius Klinger fonts</a> for my wife's event fliers and inserts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>MIke, Satisfaction is one of my favorite fonts—when I must sign my name on an electronic piece that I've designed, I always use it as my signature...
In a different life, I would have used Harold's "imitation" font -- I'm a sucker for a great looking casual script.
I'd like to see some of your wife's event fliers. I can't imagine Julius Klinger set for more than a few words, and would like to see the use she made of it. :-)
And MIke, I've been here a long while, I just never spoke up. And then one day, I saw the dafont thread - and got pissed. And you know me when I'm pissed... LOL</div>
