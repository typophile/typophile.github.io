  body: "thanks Rob, nice looking site, and interesting content, thanks especially
    for the Alvin Lustig link, absolutely amazing site, and mindblowing designer.
    He died so young, I wonder why? I agree with you about the site, it stands out
    as far as design and content goes, way above the rest. \r\n\r\nhere is another
    link, my favorite on the web as far as design goes, you might be interested. \r\n\r\nhttp://designarchives.aiga.org/\r\n\r\nmike\r\n"
