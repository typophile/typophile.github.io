    (Normal, Condensed or sometimes Extra Condensed)\r\nNOVEMBRE-DECEMBRE: \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot|Peignot]]-like\"
    with main difference on /R; [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/euro-sans-pro|Euro
    Sans]] is close too; [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/g-type/accent-graphic|Accent]]
    is interesting and possibly closer for '1955' which actually throw me off.\r\n\r\nCouldn't
    find a match for the first one. Still searching... You could try to mix different
    styles of [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chaletcomprime/viewfonts|Chalet Comprim\xE9]]
    but that's far from matching.\r\n"
