  for my font and so far I have proportional and tabluar versions of lining figures
  and oldstyle figures. I am working on the superior and inferior numerals and wanted
  to also include numerators and denominators to make custom fractions.\r\n\r\nI've
  checked on the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/figures.htm|Microsoft
  Character Design Standards]] and the [[http://www.decodeunicode.org/|Decode Unicode]]
  pages but since the fraction figures don't appear, I'm assuming I have to put them
  in a private use area?\r\n\r\nI also wondered about using the same glyphs as the
  superior/inferior numerals with an Opentype pos routine. Would that work?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :)"

    how they handle it. If it works in Myriad/Minion/etc. it should work for your
    fonts, too.

  body: Yes, that crossed my mind too. They seem to put them in the Private Use areas,
    so I guess I'll use the same Unicode indexes. Thanks :)

    definitely wouldn't recommend looking at old Adobe fonts like Minion Pro or Myriad
    Pro. Look at new fonts like Arno Pro or Garamond Premier Pro for guidelines on
    good practice. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Thanks, Adam. In Arno Pro, only the superior and inferior numerals have Unicode
    indexes; the others (oldstyle numerals and fraction forms) appear as zero.v, zero.s
    and zero.u without encodings.\r\nGaramond Premier is a little better, with zero.denominator
    at U+F655 and the numerator at U+F661. (Private use areas)\r\nMinion Pro and Myriad
    follow the same pattern as GPP.\r\nThis is all a bit puzzling :S"

  body: "Here is my thinking, and the why -- the \"why\" because you may decide something
    else makes sense.\r\n\r\nI make up separate superiors, \"supers\" and denominators
    and numerators. The superiors are for direct entry, as with an equation, NOT to
    be used via an OT feature. The reason is that the text file is not changed via
    the use of the feature; if you want 10^2, that is what should be in the file.
    \"Supers\" in my fonts are for things like footnote calls.\r\n\r\nI work pretty
    hard on my footnote calls (\"supers\"). They usually ride higher than a numerator
    (or a superior, for that matter), as the sequence all)\" and a note call should
    not create a lot of visual bounce along the top (ascender, parenright, quote,
    footnote call). \"Supers\" are usually a touch smaller than numerators, too.\r\n\r\nNumerators
    and denominators should balance with the figures, both oldstyle and lining, in
    size, weight and vertical position. Denominators will usually be different than
    subscripts, as superscripts/subscripts should have the height/dept for use in
    an equation; equations are different than a string of just figures.\r\n\r\nAs
    for encoding, I don't. I use \"one.super\", \"one.numr\", and \"one.dnom\", etc.
    They have no Unicode number. But I work on fonts only to be used in our shop,
    with InDesign. If you want to give them PU Unicode assignments, that seems OK.\r\n\r\nIt
    is extra work to make up good sets of these numbers, but it pays off. Sidebearings
    differ for the sets, to keep them amenable to class kerning, with minimal kerning
    exceptions. As I said, I think size, height and weight are slightly different
    for the different uses. And by all means remember what will remain in the text
    file should it be \"repurposed\"; OT features don't change what is in the file."
