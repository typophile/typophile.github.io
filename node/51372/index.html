  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've actually been trying to conceptualize, for several years, a typeface to convey a particular idea (that I don't want to give away just yet) and it recently occurred to me that in order to achieve the desired connotation I'm shooting for, it would be desirable to do create a typeface combining several different aspects, one of which was the paradigm of the brush + a serif font. Once I realized this, I immediately thought of Underware's work and Dolly in particular. To be honest, I can't really think of another brushy serif that isn't compared to Dolly (Dederon often being cited as a clone). Of course I want to avoid aping someone else's work, but it almost seems that when it comes to designing a brush-informed serif typeface it is inevitable that it will be compared to the exemplar of the genre: Dolly. It doesn't seem possible that in the hundreds of years of type that Dolly was the first example of a brushy serif, but I can't think of one that pre-dates it or many other types that would fit into this category. Before I go any further, I'm curious if anyone out there is aware of other serif typefaces that that incorporate the brush-formed structure and still avoid the problem of looking too much like Dolly. Also, is it possible to create a brush serif that avoids Dolly comparisons? Will Dolly, in time, be seen as the father of the genre, much as Johnston's Underground has spawned so many humanist sans typefaces? If you're so inclined, please enlighten me! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">If there is any typeface to which Dolly would be indebted it would be DTL Dorian... especially in the italics. 
Dorian is brushy but not buttery soft like Dolly. However, Dolly is no chop-shop counterfeit job. It would be what Tiffany is calling an homage. Gingko mentioned in another thread should not even mentioned in amongst the same company.

Dorian came around 1997. Dolly 2001.

I think it's definitely possible to create a brush-inspired serif without cloning Dolly—you can exaggerate thicks and thins and experiment with more eccentric letter forms, which Rumba starts to do.

		<div class="commentbody">hmmm, some of these bring up another aspect that makes Dolly itself, the element of 'structure', especially in the Roman. Some of these other brushy faces, like Rumba, distance themselves from Dolly by incorporating a more eccentric character. That's probably why I didn't think of them to begin with. Also some of this other 'Dutch school' stuff is good to be reminded of. Actually, I should have investigated this area first, because my ideas started coming together when someone referred to Grandia as being 'Reading house style' and I was thinking of what would characterize the 'KABK house style' and thought that it would be this brushy stuff. Then I thought what would happen if I reconciled the two houses and incorporated elements of both in a typeface. Looking at the Kompilat thread actually scares me a bit. I know I looked at it before I started Reading, but I never referred to it when I was Designing Grandia, it must have become engrained in my unconciousness. Yet it's interesting that Ondrej and I made quite a lot of the same design decisions, espeically in the Roman. Thank goodness the italics are more divergent! His roman has a few brush elements (as Does Grandia), but is more calligraphic in general than brush-informed. Interesting, gives me a lot to think on. Thanks for your help, folks. Of course more comments are welcome, if you desire to make any...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I regard Peter Verheul’s work as the main inspiration for a lot of brushy typefaces from The Hague. This can be seen in his typeface [[http://www.farhill.nl/01_typefaces/versa.html|Versa]] which is used throughout the book Dutch Type. An even better example is the precursor to Versa, called Nardy, which he designed in the mid-nineties. Peter Verheul might be relatively unknown to most but he makes innovative and sometimes highly experimental designs and has a good hand for teaching.

The origins of this brush style can be attributed to the calligraphic exercises with the flat brush that he teaches at the MA Type & Media. I teach this technique to a group of undergraduate students at the KABK as well. The flexible brush is more difficult to control than the stiff broad-nibbed pen but it also invites playfulness and experimentation.

On a different note: I wouldn’t classify Lexicon (1992) as particularly brushy though (Trinité (1979) would suit that title better) but both of Bram de Does’ typefaces have inspired numerous (ex-)KABK students indeed.

BTW: Paul, calling Ondrej “from the house of KABK” doesn’t do him justice, does it? He only started at the MA Type & Media two months ago. All his work shown here on Typophile was made whilst he was still an undergraduate in Bratislava.</div>

Of course i find it silly to make stereotypical remarks myself, so all this talk of 'Reading style' and 'KABK style' is a bit tounge-in-cheek. I will have to buy some brushes and do some experiments of my own with them. Are there other implements that you experiment with in the courses you teach? I'm ready to start getting my hands dirty in this respect.</div>

I think I would describe this as a Dutch quality after seeing the traits in so many Dutch faces. 

Brioso also has a "wet-look" but reads more as pen than brush. 

Can you approach this by choosing a different structure (Modern rather than Renaissance)?

For an example of a brushy Clarendon, see Parry (Dutch, once again). </div>

Different surfaces produce different results too, or using (thin) gouache instead of calligraphy ink. I'd recommend using flat nylon brushes with widths between 10 mm and 20 mm.

Also check the pictures of Yomar Augusto’s workshop at the last ATypI conference. He practised his brush calligraphy skills already before he enrolled at Type & Media and his graduation work [[http://www.yomaraugusto.com/type02.html|Dendekker]] shows this influence clearly.</div>

From what I've seen, the French have the same affinity for the soft brush (again, correct me if i'm wrong), so i would avoid calling it strictly 'Dutch' as it is seen in other type cultures although it is quite prevalent in the low countries.

<em>Can you approach this by choosing a different structure (Modern rather than Renaissance)?</em>

I'm actually thinking a slab.</div>

I also saw [[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/images/front/Elena_Preview.pdf|Elena]] a while back (also a Reading face, from '07). And of course [[http://www.teff.nl/fonts/collis/collis.html|TEFF Collis]]. They aren't as rounded as Dolly, but I do see some similarities in structure.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry to resurrect this thread, but I just remembered something when thinking about the comments made in this thread if Gerrit Noordzij is the father of the brushy style. 

Check his typeface called Ruit. It isn't available for sale as far as I know, but there is a small sample in the book <em>Dutch Type</em> ([[http://books.google.nl/books?id=sR9g5xPPJVQC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=gerrit+noordzij+Ruit&source=bl&ots=V4oca6AqzH&sig=HWxEgdYNgS_MQUkD5gCWBQZpSf8&hl=nl&ei=3EnSScnbBcKy-QbN9sy2BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA157,M1|check here]]) and it's also used throughout the book <em>Jan van den Velde -- schrijfmeester 1569–1623</em> where it was officially presented.

I'm sure most of you have seen it, but I thought I'd add it to the thread anyway, since these kind of typefaces interest me alot.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Cooper Old Style, from the 1920s, pre-dates Dolly.

Here are some from the phototype era:
Caxton, by Les Usherwood, 1981, an update of his earlier Graphis.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brushy_5814.jpg]

A lot of Typsettra display work had a brushy quality:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BarB2_4527.jpg]

Usherwood's master artwork was done with a brush, caps 5" tall.
But really, the sharp-serifed Flange was also inherently brushy, as the fine points demonstrated a quality of brushwork.

And to repeat James' post: Garth Graphic (not by Usherwood), 1979:
