  to make a regular and light weight from. I am trying to do this by bringing the
  font into fontlab and make the other weights form the existing font using a multiple
  masters approach. Is this possible with just a single weight or will i need to make
  a light weight or hairline to provide a second master? Thanks in advance for any
  help. \r\n\r\n"
