    somehow it has a cheerful feel."

  body: "As with all Christian Schwartz's designs, it's a good solid, contemporary
    and sleek design. I like its rhythm and rigour and it has plenty of widths and
    weights to suit different purposes. I'd love to have the chance to licence it.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure the massive x-height makes it very useful for extended reading."

    don't know what would qualify as \"famous\" for you, but Amplitude has been used
    in a number of high profile publications, too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n<em>Wallpaper</em>
    was already mentioned. Another is <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine.\r\n\r\nSee
    also:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude/inuse\r\nhttp://www.christianschwartz.com/amplitude.shtml\r\n"
