  body: My Changeling won&#39;t match this exactly. I made the A and M wider and used
    a lower crossbar on the R. &#40;I consider these improvements :-&#41; I changed
    quite a few other things in it, such as adding a ton of alternate characters and
    new weights and styles.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know of any available digital versions
    of the original under its real name &#40;i.e., China&#41; but there are some out
    there with other names such as <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com/cgi-bin/castcraft/dc2.02?135%2C256"
    target="_blank">Camp Caps</a> if you need to match it exactly.

  body: One digitization that matches this sample is Southern Software&#39;s &#39;Eyechart
    Display Caps SSi&#39;, which is widely available on the web.

  body: Yeah, that&#39;s one of them. It&#39;s not very well digitized and has a very
    incomplete character set, but it may work for you.

  body: Chris, support the Indie community and buy Marks font. In the long run you
    will be happier with a complete font.
