  in my font. I deleted the glyphs, then I was able to \"Clean up\" my classes to
  remove the deleted glyphs from the classes, but the kerning pairs are still in the
  kern feature. Every time I try to compile, I get the \"one or more glyphs in the
  font are missing.\" error with an option to generate all the missing glyphs.  I've
  tried updating the kern feature without success.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to delete all
  the kerning pairs from the missing glyphs. I've done it before, but for the life
  of me, I can't find any answers out there.\r\n"
