  through old portfolio work for storage I came across this small passage I set for
  a letterpress class. It came directly from the Oxford English Thesaurus, hard copy,
  c 2000.\r\n\r\n"

  body: There is no comparable adjective for Art, Music, or Architecture, although
    there is <em>Engineering</em>, which has some similarly negative meanings, e.g.
    <strong>social engineering</strong>.

  body: "None of those end in \"-ing\".\r\n\"Designing\" is a gerundive,  a verbal
    form used as a different part of speech. That is the point of Christopher's <em>double
    entendre</em>, to recontextualize \"designing\", something which designers do
    every day, in a different light.\r\n\r\nSeveral of those other words carry double
    meanings, e.g. artiste, which is used to describe \"a member of the company\"
    (e.g. ballet), as well as perjoratively, but there is no \"arting\" or \"musicing\".
    Well, not much.\r\n\r\n I have also occasionally come across \"fonting\"."

  body: "\"Artful\" can also be used in the sense of \"mischievous\". Were people
    prejudiced against artists, or what?\r\n\r\nA few random phrases of Shakespeare
    using \"design\" in the sense of \"plan\" (usually in the negative sense):\r\n\r\n\"[...]

    too-\"\r\n(ordering a servant to keep his trap shut:) \"The third is that thou
    wilt be a voluntary mute to my design ..\"\r\n(About King Rick II, gone off to
    war) \"For his designs crave haste ..\"\r\n\r\n(to use on the \"Critique\" forum:)\r\n\"...
