  movie \"Avatar\"?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.avatarmovie.com/\r\n\r\nI've Googled \"avatar
  movie typeface Cameron\"\r\n\r\n2/3 of the hits were for any site with \"avatar,\"
  meaning someone's proxy.\r\nLots of hits for \"typeface\" and \"movie\" etc.\r\n\r\nA
  few hits specifically mentioned the font, calling it Papyrus. It's verrry similar
  to Papyrus, but there are a number of salient differences (and there are only four
  characters in the word \"Avatar\"). Perhaps it is Papyrus with these few differences:\r\n\r\n1.
  Crossbar of first A doesn't touch\r\n2. Apexes of other A's don't touch\r\n3. V
  has a calligraphic ending stroke on left leg\r\n4. Crossbar of T is less curved
  than in Papyrus\r\n5. Leg of R ascends above bowl. Bowl doesn't touch leg at the
  waist. Right leg of R has a different termination.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    quite closely to Papyrus. I would say that this is modified from Papyrus.\r\n\r\n

    of the font used, sure it don't seem there were a lot of work put in that logo.\r\nBut
    maybe they didn't use Papyrus after all (where have I seen that R already?), maybe
    they used a discarded Lord of the Rings typeface... or a free font."

    and shape as they are in Papyrus. It has to be a Papyrus mod.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
