  I came across:\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=tXCumMOvWRQC]]\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface in which it was set strongly resembled, at least to me, the rotunda of
  Peter Sch\xF6ffer. I Googled the book up by its title, and found it was an important
  book, and also that he was indeed the publisher of that book's <em>first</em> edition.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  on the \"About this book\" page, I found that it was not the first edition. Rather,
  it was an edition of 1479, printed by no less than... Nicolas Jenson. In <em>his</em>
  famed rotunda, no doubt."

  body: "Incidentally, in further searching, I found that a copy of this very edition
    was sold by Christie's... for a measly $5,300 or thereabouts. About what a nondescript
    First Folio used to go for decades ago.\r\n\r\nAnd, this time in the Internet
    Archive, I've found another incunabula by Jenson. However, their site is slow
    right now, so I don't know whether this is another Rotunda, or an example of his
    famous Roman, but it is praised as a beautiful book in the comments in any case.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.archive.org/details/augustinidecivitatedei00jensuoft]]\r\n\r\nAh,
    it's in Jenson's gothic type - so says a site asking $23,500 for a copy. And,
    having finished downloading it, it's not even his Rotunda this time.\r\n\r\nImproving
    my search skills, however, I found one book by Jenson in a Roman typeface:\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=zweEs0ylCfcC]]\r\n\r\n(Historia
    Naturalis en Italiano)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Griffo_1_4247.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
    another one by him on Google Books also in his famed Rotunda:\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=iIC-DowyTpIC]]\r\n\r\n(Incipiunt
    Capitula Prime Partis Summe Super Totam Theologiam Fratris Sancti Thome de Aquino)\r\n\r\nAnd,
    while we're at it, while neither <em>De Aetna</em> nor the <em>Hypnoerotomachia</em>
    is on Google Books, here is\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=nooXntOHyFAC]]\r\n\r\n(De
    Gradibus Medicinarum)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=8_NRSNHl1zMC]]\r\n\r\n(De
    Morbo Gallico)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Griffo_3_4375.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's a book from 1501 that seems to be in a beautiful Roman face:\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Py48AAAAcAAJ]]\r\n\r\n(Liber
    de Imaginatione, by Pico della Mirandola)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Griffo_2_5729.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    a book written by Aldus Manutilus himself, apparently - in his Greek typeface:\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=lUI8AAAAcAAJ]]"

  body: "Your Google Books searches prompted me to do a couple of my own, looking
    for works published by Marcolini, whose italic is of interest because Mardersteig
    reckoned it to have been based on the chancery hand of the calligrapher Francesco
    Alunno, of whom I am a fan. And from there I discovered that Nicholas Barker is
    also an Alunno aficionado, and in 2009 produced a major monograph and reproduction
    of all the known surviving calligraphic works (including the famous collection
    that was lost for over a hundred years, and then broken up by an auctioneer when
    it was rediscovered). Hurrah!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hesdegraaf.com/Book/Detail/the-glory-of-the-art-of-writing-the-calligraphic-work-of-francesco-alunno-of-ferrara\"><em>The
    glory of the art of writing. The complete calligraphic work of Francesco Alunno
    of Ferrara</em></a>\r\n\r\nClever two-way slipcase too.\r\n\r\nSo thanks for the
    diversion!"
