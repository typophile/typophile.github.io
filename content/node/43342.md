  body: I love big lunches, and over several days could easily have a hundred euros
    worth of coffee if I really, really tried. But I can't believe that 1000 euros
    covers just coffee breaks and lunches. If you said fancy dinners, too, I wouldn't
    bat an eyelash. But 1000 euros for coffee break and lunches? In Thessaloniki??
    And Sofia???
