  have the means to have a graphic designer revisit mine (which I'm trying to set
  up).\r\nNevertheless, maybe something can be done about the font, at least for the
  header/name (the rest I think I'll keep in Tahoma or courrier). Would you give me
  your feel about a font if I describe what is the aim of the site and what I whish
  to express?\r\nI know well it's a personal choice, but my range of font is extremely
  limited, so all advise, feel, any idea would be really  welcome!\r\n\r\nThe site
  will about saving a home/ historical, the subject serious, communicated mostly through
  pictures but also some text of course. The content Iam aiming for is clear, honest,
  and also aesthetic. The design and structure so far I wish as clean, simple, but
  significant - there should be an own identity to the title/  name. I haven't designed
  a logo yet, so for the moment I just wish to give as much meaning to the name by
  choice of font as possible, it's 'deeprooted'.\r\nI was going for Arial in size
  72, bold black, but maybe there are more fitting choices with a stronger identity
  - \r\n\r\nhave you alternatives in mind?\r\n\r\nmany many thanks - let me know if
  I should clarify\r\n"

  body: "If you're limited to system fonts I think Georgia and Constantia convey a
    mood compatible with what you're describing (partly because they have hefty Bolds,
    and you seem to want weight).\r\n\r\nBTW, Tahoma is flawed for extended text (too
    tight) which is why Verdana was created.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
