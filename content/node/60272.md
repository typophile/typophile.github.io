body: I'm probably just being ignorant, but we have a type spec here from the previous
  publisher of a publication we've acquired, and in some places it says things like
  "27pts b/b above to last text line" or "8pts b/b below to doi line" ... I know what
  everything else means but what does "b/b" stand for?

    out on anything by <em>not </em>knowing \u2013 and I was right, it would all make
    just as much sense without them having said that \u2013 but it's the sort of thing
    that niggles, you know?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver
