  to the right were moving scores. I am not sure if they were even a font. The Roman
  numerals were static. If I can find out what all three are then I will be so delighted!\r\n\r\nhttp://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1957score.png\r\n\r\nThese
  examples are from the year 1957, a show in Germany. I am not sure if that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much in advance for your help. If you need some more samples of this font do
  let me know.\r\n\r\nIs the font available online? Can I read about it and its designer
  anywhere?\r\n\r\n"

    I found this video:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O_kp7Ev0dc\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if the user has taken pictures and used then for this video or if (s)he
    has discovered the fonts. The Roman numerals also seem pretty accurate.\r\n\r\nYes,
    in the coming weeks I will have many questions about fonts used in the contest.
    Are you a fan?\r\n\r\nI found this: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/GMbUma_2r2s/0.jpg. Does
    it help? I can get more screenshots from the video of the contest if it helps.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a a video of the actual voting on the night: http://youtu.be/-NWB2x5Venw?t=3m23s\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your help!"

    video in the hope of 1) seeing the one or two frames that you're talking about,
    and 2) being able to pause at that exact point, capture the image, and compare
    or evaluate it.\r\n\r\nIt would be more helpful if you did those tasks, at least
    through the capturing the appropriate image. Note that at best, low resolution
    you-tube videos make very poor samples that are often almost impossible to identify
    - particularly if the typeface in question is at all detailed.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
