  in protest over the coming legislation here \u2013 the \u2018draconian\u2019 s92A
  Copyright Amendment Act. If you know or deal with any New Zealanders online (<em>especially</em>
  the creative ones), remind them to sign the petition at <a href=\"http://www.creativefreedom.org.nz\">The
  Creative Freedom Foundation</a> and write to their MPs this week. \r\n\r\nFor evil
  to triumph, good men and women need do nothing* \u2013 but if guilt upon accusation
  and the subsequent summary disconnection of one's online activities bothers you
  in any way \u2013 join the protest.\r\n\r\n*misattributed to Edmund Burke, apparently.\r\n\r\n[Edit]
  just in at midnight our time... <em>\"The Creative Freedom Foundation are celebrating
  tonight after National's announcement this afternoon that Section 92A will be scrapped,
  and that they will work towards finding an alternative.\"</em>\r\n\r\nNormal service
  has been resumed; please do not adjust your set.\r\n\r\n"
