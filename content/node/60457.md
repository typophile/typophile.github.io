  body: "Sometimes when no searches are getting anywhere it means something has been
    customized. This might be a common sans serif font with one letter redesigned
    and replaced, such as the R. Even if that is not the case, you might be able to
    duplicate it that way. Use the P to create a new R. Sometimes letter 'transplants'
    might be used to create a custom look. Depends on what your purposes are.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks Mike, you might be correct on this one.\r\n\r\nIt's similar to a medium
    weight Century Gothic as far as some of the slight peculiarities of the font (like
    the middle arm of the F and E and the leg of the R), but the M and S are very
    different shapes and some of the proportions seem rather different. The corners
    of the logo type also seem less sharp than Franklin Gothic, which makes me think
    it might be another typeface.\r\n\r\nGood thoughts in any case, thanks for the
    input."

    Initially, I'm leaning towards Fontbureau's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-nobel/nobel-regular/\">Nobel</a>,
    but with possibly the S of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/\">Avant
    Garde</a>\r\n\r\nLike this\u2026\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_3865.png]"

  body: "Thanks guys, and it's really really close. Looks like the original is a bit
    heavier weight and there's a slight difference on the bottom point of the M (not
    sure of the typographic term for that). Here's a bigger sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/info_big_6650.jpg]"
