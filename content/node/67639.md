  body: "Interesting!\r\n\r\nBut, like in many modular/geometric typefaces, some letters
    cause problems in terms of distinguishing them from another. Especially D\u2260O
    and V\u2260U. BTW, where has zero gone? ;)\r\n\r\nRegarding inconsistency\u2026
    In some of your glyphs you avoid diagonals at any cost (e.g. V), in others you
    don\u2018t (X, Z, 7). Maybe you could either find a way to avoid them entirely
    or let other glyphs also \u201Cprofit\u201C from breaking out of the strictly
    squarish grid.\r\nTo me, the glyphs with a single stroke instead of the paper-clippy
    doubled stroke tend to stand out a bit too much (esp. S, 2 and 8). Maybe you could
    try to include some paper clips on these? Or how about overlapping the two shapes
    of the 8?\r\n\r\nAlso, the glyph widths seem dissonant to me \u2013 e.g. X looking
    too wide, H, T and 7 too narrow etc.\r\nBut to judge this, a pangram or short
    sentence would be helpful.\r\n\r\nKeep it up,\r\n\r\nj\xF6rg"

  body: 'Nice.  I feel the letters should be really close together. This will create
    regular clusters of verticals here and there with the wide spaces of the letters
    in between.  As it is, the spaces between the letters seem like letters themselves..I
    have not thought this out completely but yes, sample sentences with various spacing
    would help. The 8 is clever, but it looks flimsy with its two large unconnected
    pieces - unlike the logic of the other letters. '

  body: "You should find a logic for over/under -lines. Think of direction of light.
    Now 'M' is symmetrical, so it looks odd. Figure out the logic. Also, your design
    is not monospaced, so look at the proportions:'T'looks too narrow, 'J' too wide,
    things like that.\r\n\r\nYou have a good idea, just follow it through. I like
    the basic design."

  body: 'In an attempt to work off of Tomi from Suomi''s advice and make the logic
    and application of the "clippy" things way more uniform JoergGustafs comments
    about modular/geometric typefaces having some real problem letters are becoming
    quite clear. As the "clippy looking things" become more uniform my O & D,   V
    & W,   K, H, X & 8 are kind of difficult to tell apart. I was wondering if anyone
    knows of some fonts that totally avoid diagonal strokes or have solved some of
    the problems i''ve encountered successfully. Just looking for some inspiration.
    Thanks for any help. '

  body: Nice overall effect of the font.  Flipping the D around a horizontal axis
    might make it more D-like since the outline will then 'start' at the gap top left
    as one naturally writes it by hand.  The tiny gaps where horizontal meets vertical
    in the black image gives an interesting 3D effect.  In the black panel also, the
    curve that joins the two parallel lines is slightly pointy rather than a perfect
    semicircle - a shape you might consider for the font as a whole.

  body: "Maybe if you extended the doubled up line to or above the top on the /D/
    and very little of that on the /O/ or maybe put it on the bottom....\r\n\r\nI
    don't like the /G/. It looks like \"...the lazy 009.\" You could easily make a
    capital G with your system, and especially since it is currently the only lowercase
    letter I would change it.\r\n\r\nThis is a really cool system that works well
    for a lot of the characters, but I'm sure you've noticed that the way the Q breaks
    the mold makes it stand out as the best letterform of the set. I think you need
    to break the rules more in order to make this a truly great font and to solve
    your differentiation issues. As it is now, I'd place this in the category of Electronics-inspired
    fonts\u2014of which there are thousands\u2014but if you are really going for string,
    paperclips, and neon lights, it should be a bit freer. At least use an angle or
    two.\r\n\r\nThat's my 2 cents..."
