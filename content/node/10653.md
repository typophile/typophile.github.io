  of the JAI-ALAY typography. I think it could be AVANT GARDE, but need confirmation.

    &#40;and maybe customized uc J, I don&#39;t know all the ligatures/alternates&#41;.
    I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve already managed to find a place where you can get
    the fonts with alternates though. Even <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=68KRNT2UX84G9GSGL1FK3WXN808GE9M0&amp;sku=ITC9109"
    target="_blank"> ITC themselves</a> don&#39;t carry them, believe it or not. <IMG

  body: Yeah, I know for a fact that 5 years ago FontShop carried Mannesmann Scangraphic
    fonts which included amongst others the ITC Avant Garde Gothic fonts <i>and</i>
    the Alternates. They were really good versions too, available in both &#34;Bodytext&#34;
    and &#34;Headline&#34; versions, which meant fine-tuned design, different spacing,
    different positioning of accents on capitals, adjusted ink traps and so on.  <BR>  <BR>Problem
    is, that was 5 years ago, and since then any reference to the availability of
    the Scangraphic versions of ITC Avant Garde Gothic has disappeared. Google is
    no help neither. You&#39;ll have to contact your local FontShop to inquire.

  body: Yay, three cheers for the Henster! Australia is a bit out of the way to go
    &#40;Font&#41;Shopping though! ;&#41; <BR> <BR>You see, the problem with these
    fancy Flash sites is that they&#39;re useless when you&#39;re trying to find something
    through a search engine.

    similar alternates for Avant Garde Condensed, Lubalin Graph, and Benguiat .
