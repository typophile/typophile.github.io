body: "I could use some of your font expertise!\r\n\r\nI am working on redesigning
  an outdoors magazine, geared towards older, male, conservative readers. \r\n\r\nCurrent
  serif fonts used for headlines/subheads/folio included Colossalis & Rockwell (Bold
  Condensed). (This combination I've inherited, not my choosing.)\r\n\r\nCan you suggest
  any fresh fonts? I need something with a squared serif preferably, and if it's available
  in various weights, that would be great. I've gone through our font library but
  I'm just not finding what I'm looking for. Undoubtedly you know of something I don't.
  I guess I kind of like Stymie, but I'm not completely sold on it.\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know if more information about the project would be helpful/necessary."

  body: "If it's a slab serif you're looking for Serifa could be a great choice. I
    once used it as part of a destination branding project where the focus was on
    rugged outdoor adventure. It worked really well:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=serifa&x=0&y=0\r\n.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want something more contemporary try Dispatch:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=dispatch&x=0&y=0\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nCaecilia
    could be another choice. I think Golf Digest uses it.\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=caecilia&x=0&y=0"
