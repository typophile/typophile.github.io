body: "Im doing a project for my graphic design class. The goal is to create 3 unique
  brochures sharing a common thread. individually these brochures are about a single
  typeface the common thread is the classification, Slab Serifs. My selections are,
  Rockwell, Chaparral, and Lubalin Graph. I know that these arn\u2019t the best and
  that serifa and stymie would be better choices but i\u2019m a student, and well
  that\u2019s all i can get my hands on. okay, so my question to you fellow type lovers
  is, does anyone know WHO created rockwell? I Keep Finding that Rockwell was created
  by Monotype Designs, But my instructor wants to know WHO created it. i assume it
  was a collective effort. the reason why its also important from a design perspective
  is because i need an image of the creator, and if the creator was a company instead
  of a single human being or a team, im going to need to find an image of a building
  and photoshop Monotype designs on the side of it. Not my style.\r\n\r\nOh and another
  question, does anyone know where i can find the three typefaces, Rockwell, Chaparral,
  and Lubalin Graph in use? I know that WHATTHEFONT.COM is useful at figuring out
  what font is used the only trouble is i have to HAVE the fonts in my cache, and
  i cant seem to find anything.\r\n\r\nId appreciate all the help i can get and i
  look forward to learning from you all.\r\n"

    uses Chaparral very well in \"The Solid Form of Language\", and Bicycling magazine
    uses it almost exclusively. I can't recall seeing the other two recently, but
    I'm sure they're around.\r\n\r\n\"serifa and stymie would be better choices \"...
    Why? These three are fine, and, to my mind, Chaparral is very good.\r\n"

    about a face called Rockwell Antique. But McGrew goes on to note \"English Monotype
    has several weights of Rockwell, a square serif family which differs from this
    face and should not be confused with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rockwell that most of us
    are familiar with is not quite the same as the Rockwell that originated as Inland
    Type Foundry's Litho Antique. But I suppose that the Salfords Works could have
    based their drawings on the American original, making changes as they saw fit.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "John -- Looking at this again, I think the relationship is greater than McGrew's
    statement might lead one to believe. It would probably be possible to trace a
    link from the English Monotype Rockwell (which gives us our current digital form)
    back to the original Inland Litho Antique. \r\n\r\nIn which case, for what it's
    worth to the original poster, Litho Antique is attributed to William Schraubst\xE4dter
    for Inland Type Foundry.\r\n\r\n-- K."
