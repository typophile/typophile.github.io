body: 'I have been so impressed by the depth of knowledge people have about typography
  on this site. I was wondering if there is an appropriate board here to list projects
  (smaller logo/brochure projects) and recieve quotes or if the members prefer to
  keep that marketplace out of this area?  '

  body: I would think it was very logical - given the global nature of this establishment
    - to keep such local things on more appropriate sites made for exactly such things.
    I can however understand that a client would come here for a top quality product,
    but in such a case they should contact the member directly. In so many words,
    please don't turn Typophile into a trivial marketplace.

    looking for freelance work watch those two sites.

  body: "this question came up in another thread, a request for pro bono work.\r\n\r\naside
    from the somewhat disturbing turn which that thread took, i asked if there is
    a general policy on typophile for job or project postings. one might think that
    if solicitations were going to be common there would be a forum just for that
    purpose. but since there isn't, it seems that typophile is not currently a marketplace
    per se, which is fine with me.\r\n\r\nit was nice of you to ask, logotype, and
    i assume anyone interested can contact you.\r\n\r\nmoderators ? i'm totally winging
    it here and i apologize if i'm out of line. \r\ntypophile rocks !"

    are sites where you can get freelancers, I am sure members will post them, like
    Krop (as above) or Behance or another creative forum... though I don't see why
    someone cannot ask as nicely as Deborah has, then to be directed to those freelancers
    for hire sites.\r\n\r\n@ James: how is the spam working out for you? although
    those spiders pick up on everything now"
