  suggest things that I would never think of on my own.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago,
  I initiated a complete rebranding of my very small company. Along with updated colors
  and logos, I selected a sans and a serif typeface to use consistently in all our
  material. I ended up picking FF Unit as the sans and Dolly as the serif. Both of
  them are excellent faces.\r\n\r\nOver time, I've grown more comfortable with Unit
  and less so with Dolly. Dolly's tone is a little too casual, and its overall color
  a little bit dark.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something contemporary that is a little
  monolinear, and has some character  without being too mannered, esp. at display
  sizes. Most of all, it needs to play well with  Unit.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm leaning
  towards Chapparal. I also really liked Chronicle Text from Hoefler. Any other suggestions
  would be wonderful. Here is a little sample of Chapparal, too low-res to be that
  helpful, but it should give you a feel of the color:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chaparral_4290.gif]"

  body: "That would definitely be the obvious choice, and would most likely work.
    I would go slightly for more of human/handwritten feel running through the serif...
    say Galliard could be nice (so a real contrast to Unit, but an underlaying concept
    they both have in common). You could go with a storm typeface, either something
    more conservative (baskerville) or more out there (serapion)\r\n\r\nH "
