  on-line. Order now and support those in need.</strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bl3magazine-on_6312.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  third issue of Building Letters is dedicated to Sri Lanka and Thailand, and it features
  interesting articles by Tom de Gay, [[Nick Shinn]], [[Max Kisman]], [[Fiona Ross]]
  and [[Donald Beekman]]. As usual, it contains a <strong>CD with 25 free fonts</strong>,
  this time donated by [[Pieter van Rosmalen]], Seonil Yun, Jos\xE9 Scaglione, David
  B\u0159ezina, Jos\xE9 Louis Coyotl Mixocatl, [[Stefan Hattenbach]], Bram Pitoyo,
  Tom\xE1\u0161 Brousil, [[Richard Kegler]], [[Veronika Burian]], J\xFCrgen Weltin
  and Ludmila Lorenz. All fonts are [[OpenType]] and with one exception, they contain
  glyphs necessary for typesetting of all Latin-script European languages (complete
  [[Unicode]] set Latin Extended A), so you can set Maltese, Welsh, or Esperanto in
  them; some faces contain special features, alternate glyphs, decorative glyphs,
  alternative numerals, ligatures, or small caps.\r\n\r\nAlthough the TV cameras are
  long gone from the places hit by the tsunami, aid is still needed. This is why all
  profit from the sales (after deduction of hard costs) will be donated to a respected
  charity Direct Relief International (http://www.directrelief.org), which will use
  the money to help those hit by the 2004 tsunami.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/building-letters-3-cover_4288.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  magazine size is A5, it has 64 full colour pages, it is published in a limited run
  of 1000 numbered copies, and it is <strong>on sale now for 35 \u20AC</strong> (aprox.
  $43) at http://www.buildingletters.org. Also, the site will publish information
  on how much money was collected, and finally, it will publish a report from Direct
  Relief on the use of the donation."
