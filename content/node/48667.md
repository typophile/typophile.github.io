  been wanting to become a graphic designer but, lately I\u2019ve been having doubts
  about having that as my major. Not because it doesn\u2019t seem fun but when I look
  online I see that they get paid very poorly that may or may not be true but, I was
  wondering what I should I move towards.\r\n\r\n here is my gallery (portfolio is
  under construction right now) \r\nhttp://izacchemical.deviantart.com/gallery/\r\n\r\nI
  do those painting for fun and for friends I don\u2019t really plan to take those
  much farther so i am shooting towards my photoshop and illustrator capabilities
  please tell me your input on this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to all who reply.\r\n\r\n"

    you go into. I'm a freelancer and there is tons of potential in my city, although
    I'm not where I want to be financially, I'm still pretty new at the game.\r\n\r\nGraphic
    Design may not be as 'fun' as being a fine-artist, or an illustrator, but it definitely
    pays the bills better in most cases. \r\n\r\nOverall, theres tons of opportunities
    in different graphic fields (animation, branding, website design, publication
    design). Do some more research. Your portfolio is nice.\r\n\r\nOh and punctuation
    is your friend in message boards, especially this one."

  body: I had a similar conversation with a fine art professor once. He pointed out
    that if I look at the parking lot, the fine art faculty were driving beat up vans
    from the 1970s and 80s, and the design faculty were driving new Volkswagons, Beemers,
    and even Porsches. The starting salaries in design do suck, but so do plenty of
    other jobs, but at least as a designer you get paid to do creative work and not
    schlep coffee and bagels all day so you can go home and do illustration work on
    your kitchen table all night.

    years in art school will leave you looking back at everything you did before and
    shaking your head. Styles and attitudes change, and you\u2019ll never know what
    happens. I started as an abstract painter, switched to digital media design, and
    finally ended up falling in love with print and type design.\r\n\r\nThe important
    thing to do is choose a school where you can experiment with everything and  where
    the fine art and design departments overlap. Take a look at the work of seniors
    and recent grads\u2014if it looks like most of the work was done entirely with
    a computer, that means you be stuck doing most of your work on the computer, and
    trust me, you\u2019ll miss out on a lot. And think about big schools so that you
    don\u2019t miss out on important classes because of scheduling conflicts or course
    cancellations due to low enrollment."

    and I am now working for a Fortune 500 company with plenty of room to move up.
    \r\n\r\nI was a fine arts major with a focus in design... It's definitely a good
    avenue to travel. I find it extremely fulfilling. \r\n\r\nMake sure to take some
    business or marketing classes on top of your design classes though, those will
    be extremely beneficial. "

  body: "How much money you make typically depends on what you're designing. If you
    design album covers and concert posters, you're most likely going to make a fraction
    of what someone designing annual reports for the medical industry is making. Of
    course, most people would find the former more fun than the latter. Where I live,
    designers right out of school would make somewhere between 30K and 45K a year,
    with most people somewhere in the middle. If you need more money than that, going
    down the motion graphic and/or interactive path might be what you want to do --
    a lot of people bill $60-100/hr after a few years in these industries. If you
    live in rural Mississippi, those numbers would be much lower, though.\r\n\r\nThe
    most important thing, though, is to not listen to \"experts\" too much, whether
    they're random people on the internet or teachers at your school. I had a million
    people tell me \"you have to get into web,\" or \"you should do more illustration,\"
    etc. while I was in school, and I took them very seriously for a long time. If
    you love doing something, you can figure out a way to make money with it."

    on the work in your portfolio, I think you should also consider studying illustration.
    It looks like you have some real talent for that, and the work in your gallery
    is closer to what an illustrator would do than a graphic designer.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not discouraging you from studying graphic design, I'm sure you would do well
    in either profession. Your best bet would probably be to take introductory courses
    in several disciplines and see what you like best."
