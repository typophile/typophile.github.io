  to it.\r\n\r\nI\xB4m trying to figure out how to set up the TOC the way I want it.\r\n\r\nIts
  a catalogue of about 130 artists and designers, sorted by the last name.\r\n\r\nHowever
  I would like to sort the table of contents based on their profession (for example
  designer) and their speciality (for example spatial design)\r\nBasically a hierarchy
  based on the steps: \r\n1. profession (which is base on paragraph style found on
  every left side page)\r\n2. speciality (which is based on paragraph style found
  on every right side page)\r\n3. last name and page number. (based on paragraph style
  found on every left side page)\r\n\r\ni.e. since all the artists/designers are spread
  out in the catalogue I want collect them based on profession and then arrange them
  by their last name. \r\n\r\nDESIGNERS\r\n       graphics\r\n              Susan
  Adamsson     5\r\n              Steve Benton            19\r\n              John
  Burton             11\r\n\r\nARTISTS\r\n       textiles\r\n              Wendy Britten
  \      17\r\n              Sam Williams         97\r\n\r\n       Ceramics\r\n               Steve
  Andersson    101\r\n               Liv Lastname          9\r\n\r\netc (more professions,
  and specialties than this, these are just examples...)\r\n\r\nIs this do-able using
  indesigns toc?\r\n\r\nFor example it seems like I can't put \"graphics\" before
  the names of the persons since \"graphics\" paragraph style is found on the page
  after the name of the designer?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know how to do this, please help,
  I\xB4m starting to think I might have to do this manually...\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
