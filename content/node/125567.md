  body: "Without knowing the age of your sample (late 1940s, early 1950s?) or country
    of origin (metal and phototypesetting faces were often copied and renamed from
    country to country), I can\u2019t be exact.\r\n\r\nAmateur Aces appears to be
    a close relative of Stymie Black Italic:\r\nhttps://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/4509/stymie\r\n\r\nPor
    OLIVERIO is Cheltenham:\r\nhttps://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/89/cheltenham\r\n\r\nHard

  body: Body looks like it could be similar to New Century Schoolbook Bold, or Bitstream
    New701 (Bitstream's version of Ionic No.5), Bitstream 702 (Bitstream's version
    of Excelsior).
