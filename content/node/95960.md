  body: "These double posts are no fun at all. It's obviously the result of a faulty
    site design.\r\n\r\nI have trouble even finding the original posts. My searches
    always have zero results. Even when I search on the subject of the *second* post,
    the search doesn't even turn up *that* post, when I can see it right in front
    of me."

  body: "skyfein, there is an easier way to check for duplicates:\r\nclick on  username
    on top (i.e. Posted by \"username\") and check the recent activity of the user
    profile.\r\nThe duplicate posts are usually located one after each other.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that the forum design is faulty. I already proposed, if the forum-software
    allows specific permissions per user group, to forbid  normal users (non admins)
    to post new topics in the FAQ & Solved sections and allow them only in the main
    Type ID Board. \r\nPosting a reply to an existing topic should be allowed for
    all, and admins off course will have full access on posting both new topics and
    new replies in any category/forum.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this can be done with
    the current forum software, but it will save a lot of energy of many people.\r\n\r\n"
