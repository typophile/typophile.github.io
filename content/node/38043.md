    \ :) \r\n\r\nOk, I see both directions -- most of the time clockwise, if I'm reading
    the text, she switches directions (to counter-clockwise) in the corner of my eye.
    \ If I look back, and stare for a moment, she switches back.  It seems my left
    and right brain are arguing (I just wish the yelling would stop.) \r\n\r\nI have
    no idea how or why it works. It does seem to accurately describe me, though, because

  body: "Well, the ambiguity is akin to the Necker Cube illusion: A silhouette with
    no depth cues makes front and back indistinguishable. \r\n\r\nI am highly skeptical
    of the claim that it tests left- or right-brained thinking, because  the whole
    idea of left-brained or right-brained people comes from a gross oversimplification
    of neuroscience.\r\n\r\nI had to struggle for several minutes to see counterclockwise
    motion, because there <i>are</i> a number of depth cues present that favor clockwise:
    the circles that the figure's hand and foot trace in the air are seen from slightly
    above, and she spends more time facing toward you than away from you, just as
    a real dancer usually would when pirouetting for an audience. So clockwise is
    more aesthetic, but also more logical. Interpreted as counterclockwise, the spinning
    figure is seen from slightly <i>below</i>, and therefore does not appear to be
    perpendicular to the floor (which we are certainly seeing from above or there
    would be no reflection), but tilting backwards, and so the motion does not look
    as much like natural human motion following the laws of physics as the clockwise
    view does."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild1_3786.png]\r\n\r\nIf you look at
    a single frame of the animation you can easily see her turned away or looking
    towards you. Whatever you choose to see. Since every frame can be viewed in two
    ways it's up to you. \r\nBut within the animation the brain has to decide for
    one direction. Otherwise the change of the black figure would make no sense. It
    is a known fact that the brain, presented with a decision with two equal choices,
    will rather \"invent\" slight differences than make no decision at all. It's part
    of human's survival strategy. \r\nThe decision making in this case is somewhat
    \"chaotic\", this is why the results may be different each time you try. But when
    the brain has decided for one direction it usually sticks to that direction. Again:
    this is the only logical way to make sense of the animation. \r\nThe connection
    to brain sides makes a nice headline, but is not very plausible. "

    perceive an anti-clockwise spin.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? It would be better
