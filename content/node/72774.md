  critique and advice on how get the letterforms to fit with each other a bit better.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ult_5232.png]"

  body: "Seems to me like fit between letters will require, first off, some work on
    optically balancing the weights. \r\nI think you've got quite a challenge to get
    a two-story /g/ into this weight of a font. Presently it looks like a bold glyph
    dropped in among ultra black letters. You can see why so many designers resort
    to a single story structure at this kind of weight--there's just not the vertical
    room to stack up four thick strokes.\r\nTerminals of /C/ and /c/ are also worth
    reviewing. Getting enough breathing room under the tittles in confined ascender
    space is another problem ahead of you.\r\nBasically these are the classic challenges
    of an ultrabold sans, and reviewing how they are addressed in others' previous
    attempts will be helpful."

  body: "Thanks Craig.\r\nDid some more work on that two story g. I can see why one
    would resort to a single story g here, but I think it's important enough to the
    character of the face that I want to stick with the two story.\r\nHave been looking
    at both Titling Gothic Black and Franklin Gothic Heavy as example of successfully
    dealing with such heavy gothics.\r\n\r\nMostly worked on the /S/ /o/ /O/ /G/ /Q/
    and numerals since last posting\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ult2_5937.png]"
