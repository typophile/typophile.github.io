  body: Looks like standard-issue Helvetica at first glance. I&#39;ll check.

  body: Yeah, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-97-black-condensed-oblique/testdrive.html?s=BUSH%2BCHENEY&amp;p=72">Helvetica
    Neue Black Condensed Oblique</a> &#40;vertically squished&#41; looks about right,
    the apostrophe doesn&#39;t match though.

    Black, stretched horizontally and slanted. Here&#39;s a recreation done in Illustrator:

  body: Not really. Distorted fonts are tricky to identify, even common ones. We&#39;re
    just so damned sharp. :-&#41;

  body: And as Franz and Mark pointed out &#40;simultaneously, I might add&#41;, Neue
    in any form is not, as I first suggested, what I&#39;d call standard-issue. I
    always think of Neue as a more sophisticated approach to Helvetica. It even survived
    the distortion in this case.
