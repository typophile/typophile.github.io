  body: "As for what to call the style, the inward curving vertical strokes are a
    feature of the mid Victorian fonts called Tuscan [Gothic] Concave. The font for
    Home Brew Good God is a later style that mixes this with features from other styles
    such as the extended flat bottoms & tops on D and B first found in a font patented
    by James Connor in 1878 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/D9433_18780808Connor_4473.jpg]\r\nDon"
