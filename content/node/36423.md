  body: "It\u2019s great to see a face this fat with a design that doesn\u2019t feel
    dated. Most faces I see in this category, regardless of how new they are, scream
    of some past era, usually in the vein of late 70s-early 80s arcade cabinet letting.
    \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s something about the dots on i and ! that distract me every
    time I see this face. I don\u2019t see a similar juxtaposition of squared and
    rounded corners in the letters, so I just can\u2019t keep my eyes off of the dots.
    In the second same, the strings of majuscules without round corners look like
    they\u2019re part of a different font than the minuscules. Being really nitpicky,
    the horizontal part of the counter in e looks wider than all of the other counters,
    which appear to be the same size."

  body: This might be one of those faces that would benefit from a unicase style.
    When it is smaller I don't mind it in two lines, but when it is bigger and the
    line length is so short the descenders seem to break the text up too much.

  body: "Fat Squeeze looks pretty well thought out. The y is an especially nice (and
    unique) touch for this genre. The left side join looks a little week though. maybe
    a more abrupt curve in to add weight? The W used he same solution, but less succesfully
    for me. What if the two counters angled the same way instead of both pulling to
    the center (more like 2 V's)?\r\n\r\nThe dot on the i and explamation seems out
    of place. Seems like it should be either a rectangular, or rounded rectangular,
    or fully rounded.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if the cap height shouldn't be the same
    as the assenders for something like this which will be used 100% (hopefully) in
    display settings. I'd lower the ascenders rather than raising the caps.\r\n\r\nThe
    trouble with dense and tight fonts like this (to me at least) is the varying density
    inherent in roman letters. Some letters present a very dense presence like the
    HIME, but letters like T and L break that up and look weak. It's a constant battle
    between desity and conistency.\r\n\r\nWhat do the A. Xx and Jj look like?\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: 'I had been wondering for months what it was that bugged me about this and
    I think I finally figured it out. These glyphs seem just a little too simplified.
    They have been denuded of some small details that would help you to identify glyphs
    more rapidly despite heir enormous girth. Let begin with a positive example :
    the lc t retains it''s tail. That makes the letter for me. The z too has great
    detail & feeling. But the lc a in contrast seems to me to be in need of a notch
    cut out of it so it can have a tail again too. Similar things might be done to
    the u & n. It may be that this kind of thing is besides the point or takes you
    in a direction you don''t want; in which case that''s fine. But that''s what occurs
    to me. Add in some small identifying detail to joust with the mechanical/modular
    heaviness.'

  body: "I think the lower case letters are pretty much all home runs. The only ones
    I would question are the k and x. I would like to see them in text. \r\n\r\nThe
    diagonals are the most difficult thing to deal with here. I like your solutions
    on the VWY.\r\n\r\nFor me the most problematic letters are the KMN. The K isn't
    bad, but isn't as great as the others.  The M looks awkward. I think part of the
    problem is that the middle stroke is thicker than the two outside ones. Maybe
    try making this thinner, rather than thicker, if you haven't already tried this.
    The N doesn't work, whereas the Z does. As Tiffany said, maybe with shorter cut
    in strokes?\r\n\r\nHave you considered also rounding the outside corners of the
    spurs on the EFT? The top inside corners on the M? \r\n\r\nThe 1 needs a new solution;
    it looks out of place. Should the right stroke on the 4 go to the top? Should
    the spur on the 7 be bigger? \r\n\r\nGreat Work!"

    Much of the lower case (see i m q r h, etc.) has this theme of a curve corner
    and a sharp corner. \r\nThis was my building concept, mixing soft and hard with
    very linear counters the sharpest feature. I was trying to find a way to make

    slice into the stem of the N. The idea I think was to make them less deep. \r\n\r\nOn
    your new M's, #2 seems to work with the rest of the face best. But I still worry
    about those diagonal cuts on the new M's and N being a little out of character
    with the rest of the face, and thus distracting. \r\n\r\nI would try thinning
    the diagonal of the N and having no cut, and thinning the middle stroke of the
    original M--you'd probably have to adjust the depth of the 'v' cut at the top,
    too. Another way would be to go with #2 and shorten the diagonal cuts in both.
    Wow, the M and N are tough!\r\n\r\nRandy's y idea is a definite improvement. I'm
    not sure about the W--did you also try the bottom of both cuts falling from the

    why I was suggesting trying the curves on the outside corners, which you said
    doesn't work. \r\n\r\nWhen I look at the whole alphabet, the N really stands out
    as discordant, and the M as clunky. I'm wondering if you don't find another better

    at least have them as alternatives. This is the kind of unicase thing Tiffany
    was suggesting. This would harmonize better than anything so far. \r\n\r\nAlso

    \r\n\r\nI don't like the new curved inner corners of the EFTL serifs. I think
    you violated the look of your other characters, where the counters are all 'slots'.
    To me breaking the slot shape hurts both the strength and unity of the face. It's
    going too 'soft', and less coherent. Seeing the new and old set in more text will
    tell the story. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure on the H. I guess I want to see it in text.
    Also if H is the only cap stem with that treatment I'm not sure it makes visual
    sense. "

    something present in the original has been tampered with. One possible solution
    - make lemonade. \r\n\r\nInstead of two families there can be 2 or more. It might
    strike you as cheating at first but I honestly think it would be at all. These
    little things make a huge difference. You might look at Hoefler's Proteus Project.

    :-). Knitting little whites is one of the best learning experiences I've had.
    \r\n\r\nMy largest concern in designing a face so fat as to challenge the very
    existence of certain features, is to be very hierarchical in determining the size
    of the tiny little \"white\" spaces. The micro-counters of \"a\" and \"e\" must
    be finely balanced by slight variation to \"equal\" those of \"p\" and \"d\",
    which must be finely balanced by slight variation to \"equal\" those of \"hnmu\"
    and so on, so that all, and their inter-letter spaces create the proper clicketty-clack
    amongst themselves (lowercase), and then with all the rest...\r\n \r\nAdditionally!
    in a dangerously fat \"some-sans\" like this, one introduces in the \"F\", \"J\"
    and \"L\", \"vast\" spaces relatively, and though you've managed to minimize these
    in the \"VWXY\" there is still a relatively vast (and unkernable) white space
    left. Where this and the slightly varying counters leaves one is with a need to
    space very precisely, to ensure less space between a character under spacing consideration
    and any other, than there is in the counter of the character under consideration,
    on both sides, always!\r\n\r\nThis whole area of style, naturally, is a serious
    challenge in a one-size fits all outline...but again this looks really good so
    far.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    to differentiate between spacing variations (curve to curve/curve to straight/angle
    to straight) and the only way I could get it was by opening up counter space.
    David Berlow's comments helped me to see that. His exercise really helped me see
    limitations. After much trial and error--a zillion revisions later, I settled
    on adding 6 units of space to the counters. This may move the sweet spot of the
    type size down a few points for high rez printing and allow better results for
    poor conditions like newsprint where spread is an issue. The only other out is
    an optical sizing structure. I will also double the UPM to 2000 to give me what
    I need for better kerning. At this point, I really need some 2400 dpi output to
    really see what I have to do.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
