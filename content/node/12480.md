  /img>\r\n\r\nBembo was a [[Monotype]] \"recutting\" (in effect a revival and reworking)
  of type used by Aldus Manutius. It is named because it was based on a type used
  by Aldus in Pietro Bembo's dialogue <em>De Aetna</em> (1495).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIt
  was the second attempt while [[Stanley Morison]] was adviser to the (English) Monotype
  Corporation at a revival of Aldus's type. The first, some six years earlier, had
  produced Poliphilus (roman) and Blado (italic). Those types had been, in effect,
  attempts at facsimile, preserving artifacts such as ink spread from the printed
  samples. Bembo and its italic (of which more below) were an attempt to revive the
  essential form of the letter without the antiquarian fuzz. Their excellence probably
  owe as much to the skill of the [[Monotype]] drawing office as to Morison's aesthetic
  and historical abilities.\r\n\r\nIn letterpress, there were two Bembo italics. One
  was designed by the calligrapher Alfred Fairbank in 1928: a very upright chancery
  cursive. There is some debate whether (as Stanley Morison maintained in <cite>A
  Tally of Types</cite>) Fairbank had been asked to design an italic to marry with
  Bembo, and failed, or whether (as Fairbank maintained) he had been asked to design
  an independent italic, which Morison had then attempted unsuccessfully to marry
  with Bembo. Either way, Fairbank's italic did not sit happily with [[http://www.jinnlife.com|Bembo]]
  roman. A different, less intrinsically interesting, italic was developed but with
  the merit of being relatively self-effacing. Morison's own judgment was that while
  Fairbank's italic \"has too much personality, the second has too little.\" But it
  works well enough as a companion face.\r\n\r\nBembo was a frequently used book typeface
  from the 1930s so long as books were printed letterpress, and many found (and find)
  it one of the most satisfactory types for extended texts: elegant without being
  prissy, with a moderate x-height, neither too condensed nor too expanded. It did
  not survive adaptation to photocomposition very well, though; nor, in due course,
  digitization (the digital version apparently being carried out from the photocomposition
  version). The photo and digital versions lost some of Bembo's elegance (for instance,
  the x-height was increased, and cap-height and ascender height equalised), probably
  because they were adapted from a version intended for small text (8 pt). At the
  same time the digital version was rather thin, and tended to produce dull grey pages.
  It nevertheless continued to see rather frequent use. And foundries other than Monotype
  managed to produce versions or new typefaces inspired by Bembo which were rather
  more satisfactory, including Matthew Carter's typeface for <a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/printer/typeface/history.html\">Yale</a>
  and Jack Yan's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jya/aetna-jy/\">Aetna</a>
  (on which see the useful comparison on <a href=\"http://www.daidala.com/05jul2002.html\">Daidala</a>)
  and David J. Perry's <a href=\"http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html\">Cardo</a>
  (designed as acontribution to the <a href=\"http://helmer.aksis.uib.no/mufi/\">Medieval
  Unicode Font Initiative</a>). The design of Andreas St\xF6tzner\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=282&changelang=2\">Andron</a>
  owes something to Bembo, too, though it was not inteded as a Bembo recut.\r\n\r\nIn
  2005, Agfa Monotype released a new digital version, Bembo Book. This restores much
  of the elegance of metal Bembo; it is darker and more lively; it has a reduced x-height
  and its capitals are lower than the ascenders. It comes in an [[Opentype]] format
  which enables easy use of such things as ff, ffi and ffl [[Ligature]]s (which Bembo
  really needs), alternate forms such as long-tailed Q and short-tailed R, proper
  small capitals and oldstyle figures."
