  body: "Your sample is Graham Meade's [[http://www.dafont.com/gm-hiptop.font?a=1%3E%3Cimg|Hiptop
    (or Hightop, it's ambiguous)]]. Graham has made many fonts for free distribution
    over the years. He also now sells some of his designs under his latest foundry
    name: [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/typotheticals/|Typotheticals]]. This doesn't
    seem to be in that collection.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
