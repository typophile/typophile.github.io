body: I would be very thankfull to anyone who can help me with this one. I tried online
  font recognision, but no result. I consider it is not a full font and thought the
  'e' looks almost italic, while the rest is so rigid.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/waddenhaven_6624.jpg]

    make an different 'a' and the italic 'e' to make a straight 'e'?\r\n"
