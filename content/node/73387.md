  font. I've got some idea how to do that, but would like to ask you, where there
  could be some tricky points I'll have to deal with. The cyrillic glyphes do allready
  exist. But all the other letters want to be created!\r\n\r\nI'm new in that forum
  so I'll just keep asking everybody for some time to learn, but I'll try to enrich
  this forum too! It's a great one!\r\n\r\nGreets Jasmin"

  body: "One question is what are you going to do with the font? Even if you can update
    it, I seriously doubt you'd be allowed to sell it. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    if you're setting type, esp. for print, there could be solutions. Starting with
    this one: if the accents themselves are already in the font, how, from reading
    a print edition of a text, could anyone tell whether you had added glyphs or simply
    done a lot kerning with existing glyphs? Or used a layout program that supported
    floating accents, such as TeX?"
