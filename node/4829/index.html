How much have you studied readabilty? <BR> <BR>&gt; parafoveal vision is used to provide a rough set of options <BR> <BR>Have you been listening to Larson? Too much, it seems. <BR>His view is certainly convenient: it makes type design much easier (and more artsy). <BR> <BR>Letterwise reading fails in the light of both empirical and anecdotal evidence. <BR>It cannot explain for example how: <BR>1) Empirical: saccades span about three times the coverage of the fovea, with the parafovea unable to convey individual letters. <BR>2) Anecdotal: Serifs helps readabililty, and loose letterspacing utterly destroys it. <BR> <BR>And there's something even worse about the letterwise model: it goes against the general heuristic mechanism of the brain, which is a fuzzy, guesswork-based system. Reading is like Chinese cuisine: nothing gets wasted - even the chicken feet are consumed. With the aid of linguistic context, the parafovea provides enough clues to identity <i>clusters</i> of letters (which is all it can convey anyway), speeding up reading - why not use the available information? <BR> <BR>Immersive reading is a liminal, performance-based task: there is no time for separate letters (most of the time). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;How much have you studied readabilty? <BR> <BR>Hrant, please zip your fly. <BR> <BR>You present your reading theories as if they are reality supported by all the latest scientific research, when in fact the issue is wide open. As Matt Davis of the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at Cambridge University put it, citing various recent scientific research, <BR> <BR>&quot;Clearly, the debate about whether we read using information from individual letters or from whole words is far from over. <BR>  <BR>In this thread, I suggested that the &quot;ligebility&quot; phenomenon presented in the hoax could be explained without recourse to the deep level of physiological reading theory, which is contested, but at the level of the problem &ndash; which is solving anagrams. <BR> <BR>It's Occam &ndash; the simpler explanation is better. <BR> <BR>But I don't think we're so far apart as you would imply with your &quot;letterwise little-boy&quot; diss. <BR> <BR>Consider these two statements from earlier in the thread:  <BR> <BR>1 (mine) In the &quot;letter sequence&quot; model of reading, parafoveal vision is used to provide a rough set of options as to how many letters there are in a word, and what the individual letters might be. If the context of the sentence does not provide closure on a particular interpretation, then foveal examination is used to determine the word. <BR> <BR>2 (yours) With the aid of linguistic context, the parafovea provides enough clues to identity clusters of letters <BR> <BR>What's the difference between a sequence of letters and a cluster of letters?</div>
