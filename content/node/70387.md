    us up with an invite?  I have heard nothing but amazing things.  Thanks!

  body: "It was not ever for invitation only. And yes, I am member. If you want to
    have free access to 50% of all commercial fonts, it is amazing. And that\u2019s
    the only thing, which is amazing there. If you want to know anything about typefaces,
    (type) design or font software, typophile is amazing. And that\u2019s the only
    thing, which is amazing here. The operators of the site, to which Rosko requests
    an invitation, mess this up. I neither can comprehend absurd comparisons with
    stolen cars on typophile, nor I can comprehend, what makes the operators and some
    members of the said warez website think, they would know anything about (type)
    design and typefaces. I will for sure not fill a request for an invitation to
    the said site, at least not, if it is requested on typophile. Not because I dislike
    people, that collect fonts just for fun or that use pirated fonts for test purposes
    (Then I had to dislike myself.), but I dislike naive and boldfaced people. And
    if you know, that the said website is a warez website, it is either naive or aggressive
    to request an invitation here. So I wanted to make Rosko know, that the said site
    is a warez website.\r\n\r\nI hope, this will not end in a long discussion about
    piracy again."
