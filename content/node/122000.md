body: "Yesterday I downloaded AFDKO for the first time. It seems like a useful tool,
  so I decided to give it a try. I've just got a couple of questions for those of
  you more experienced with it than me...\r\n\r\n1. When checkOutlines is run, I'm
  getting a few <em>\"Need to inspect for possible loop/inflection\"</em> warnings.
  Nowhere can I find, however, what a loop/inflection is. I'm guessing that it might
  be reversed control points on a node causing the outline to loop back on itself,
  but I don't have any of those issues, nor can I find anything wrong with the flagged
  outline segments. Of course it's only a suggestion to check the glyph outline, so
  maybe there's nothing wrong at all. Even more likely, is that I don't understand
  the warning.\r\n\r\n2. The second mystery notice says variations of, <em>\"Need
  to fix point(s) outside triangle by 0 units in X and 1 units in Y.\"</em> Again,
  I can take a wild guess that this might be telling me that both control points need
  to be on the same side of the curve. Again, I'm likely wrong, but if not, why does
  it matter? I see no particular reason why this would cause a problem as long as
  it doesn't cause any un-noded (is that a word) extreme points. FontLab has no warnings
  about this, and I've never run into any issues because of it.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  shed a little light on this cryptic stuff?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
