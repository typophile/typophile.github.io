  and most interestingly. Is it a 6,7 or 12 column grid any extra info would be great.
  Some of the best I can think of are, Esquire, GQ, popular mechanics, GOOD, Monocle
  and Plastique.\r\n\r\nHere are some samples from Anthem magazine's recent redesign\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feature286_5950.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feature287_5309.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feature288_3907.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feature289_4291.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feature290_5536.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feature291_4142.jpg]"

  body: XO, I am more interested in the grid, than the layouts. I find it interesting
    to dissect the foundation of the magazine, as it shows the designers true craftsmanship.

  body: "Koop, I am aware of that, however, the way you worded it was a bit too close-ended.
    It seems you fixed it though.\r\n\r\nIt's amazing how something as simple as a
    well-thought-out grid can be used to arrange an assortment of objects to have
    visual flow."

  body: "Another magazine that does a great job is oddly enough Field & Stream. I
    don't have any examples of thier grid but here are some images, from a past issue
    after the re-design.\r\n\r\nArt Director Neil Jamieson talks about the process
    as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spd.org/2009/09/field-stream.php#more"
