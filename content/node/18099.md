  Bliss </a>  in a newspaper ad and it reminded me again how important [[Edward Johnston]]\u2019s
  Railway type (1916) has been to the sans world. It\u2019s easy to forget that [[Gill
  Sans]] got 95% of its genetic material from Johnston, and that Johnston preceded
  [[Futura]] by 12 years.  I can\u2019t think of any sans of note that predated it
  except [[Akzidenz Grotesk]]. Even though Johnston was not available as a commercial
  face for more than 80 years (<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/johnston/\">ITC
  Johnston</a>, 1999) its influence was immediate and worldwide \u2013 since, then
  and now, many of the world\u2019s educated people seem to pass through London. Johnston\u2019s
  influence can even be seen in <a href=\"http://www.clearviewhwy.com/ \">Clearview</a>,
  coming soon to a road sign near you if you live in N. America. P22\u2019s <a href=\"http://p22.com/products/london.html\">London
  Underground</a> is faithful to Johnston\u2019s original and has some cool extras,
  but also has a very restrictive license.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/itcjfortypo.gif]"

      take this to limit most commercial uses of the font. No such limits appear on
      the ITC agreement - at least that's the way I took it. Would you take the above
      as restictive? Maybe I've taken it wrong. My primary use is for signage and
      packaging. I wasn't so concerned about the embedding issue."

    actual EULA is difficult to discover: the only way I've found is to initiate a
    purchase, and scroll through the display in a ridiculously small frame. \r\n\r\nIt
    restricts \"embedding\" of the font to \"a static graphic image (for example,

    body: I have licenses for both the P22 package and the complete ITC Johnston family.
      I bought the ITC after P22 because it seemed less restrictive. But I am a novice,
      may be totally naive here. I know there's little chance of getting caught either
      way and there are lots of gray areas - but if we restrict a product we produce
      we want others to abide by those restrictions, so I try to do the same where
      possible. I'd love some help here.

    the term \"allowable\" is left hanging without clarification and that it sounds
    like the \"may require additional licensing\" is the norm rather than the exception.\r\nSomewhere,
    in ALL foundries' EULAs, there needs to be a place where the legal-speak is translated
    into language that is clear to the end user.  I will grant you that users need
    to \"Read and reread\" if you will grant me that EULA writers need to reread and
    rewrite as well.  The danger to the foundry is that there is a potential for confusion

      But see some helpful clarification from P22''s Kegler at the bottom of the posts.
      Quote from P22 owner Kegler: "A font is licensed as a tool to design with. We
      have no interest in hindering that...Packaging by itself does not require additional
      licensing beyond just the proper licenseing of the font to begin with." - not

    more how much education is needed in regards to font licensing and their EULAs.\r\n\r\nI'd
    say this confusion comes from people only surface reading the EULA. I had the
    same confusion about their EULA until I actually sat down read it and then asked
    Rich and Carima what they meant. These foundries are run by people not robots.
    They can answer questions and most of the time will take the time to do so right
    away just to make sure you don't get stuck on a slippery slope. Most situations
    where you must additionally license a font are for extreme cases which most small
    companies rarely enter. However, if a small company does find themselves needed
    more licensing, chances are they are going to be doing a large enough project
    to cover most instances of the needing more licensing. \r\n\r\nIf it is an icon,
    dingbat or illustration typeface design you shouldn't be surprised that you need
    additional licensing. Most if not all foundries that have typefaces like this
    will require it. "

    in Justin Howes' book? My understanding is that there was a little bad blood between
    them but that Gill acknowledged his debt to Johnston. Italics and weight varieties
    not withstanding, I find that where Gill and Johnston differ (lowercase t, w's
    that stand on stiletto heels) I prefer Johnston.

    Grotesk.</em>\r\n\r\n19th century sans serifs (like other 19th century type genres)
    don't get much respect, although they have certainly been noted in design histories;
    Meggs gives appropriate space to the first flurry of releases in London in the
    1830s. They were in frequent use in all kinds of typesetting, lettering, signage,
    and architectural inscriptions. Rian Hughes has just released a face based on
    British cast iron street name signs, which are all over the place and looking
    damn fine (although he has kept things grungy rather than cleaned them up).\r\n\r\nThe
    foremost (1989) digital sans based on a 19th century model is David Berlow's Bureau
    Grotesque, after types of the Stephenson Blake foundry, and at the request of
    art director Roger Black. Another face in the same genre is Jonathan Hoefler's
    Champion. These faces have been very well used, especially in magazines and newspapers.\r\n\r\nIn
    comparison to the Victorian Grotesques, Johnston's work, like his calligraphy,
    is a little rough around the edges, naive, even. But that is part of its appeal,
    linking it to the arts and crafts movement, and it's as part of that return-to-basics
    philosophy that Johnston's work resonated across Europe.\r\n\r\nFor a typeface
    family, the Johnson idea worked well in many branches, including regular text,
    but the condenseds were not as good as those of the Grotesque. \r\nNB: The bold
    sans serif condensed all-caps face was a massive pillar of 19th century Victorian
    jobbing typography -- Caslon & Livermore showed 15 pages of it in their 1837 specimen.

      of his face comes from the calligraphic influence I suppose. Keith Tam has an
      excellent paper on the sans/calligrahic influence.\r\nhttp://keithtam.net/documents/sanserif.pdf\r\n\r\n<em>Naive</em>
      is a wonderful way to describe Johnston. I think the lowercase can also be described
      as friendly."
