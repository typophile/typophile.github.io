  a very neat font used on all of their publications.  I searched for it on the internet
  and still have not found it. I am designing a website for a web design class and
  would love to incorporate it in my layout.   Any information on the name and where
  I could obtain it would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/salamanca_font_sample_3644.jpg]"

    had the chance of seeing the awesome Universitas Studii Salamantini designed by
    Typerware (Andreu Balius and Joan Carles Casasin) specially for the Universidad
    de Salamanca.\r\nThere is a very interesting article (sorry, just spanish) about
    the whole thing in <a href=\"http://www.andreubalius.com/andreubalius/type02_universitas.html\">Andreu
    Balius site</a>, don't miss the last link at the bottom of the page for more information.\r\nI
    don't believe it is available for purchase though."

  body: Thanks Ignacio and marcox.  While I was over there I did see the Salamantini
    type, but I thought it was just a ancient font from the Universidad.  Glad I now
    know where it really comes from! As for my website I decided to go with Patzcuaro.  Thanks
    again for all your help.
