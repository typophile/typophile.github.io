  if this Bobo is a rip-off of another font? You know, like Dawn Castle/Dom Casual.
  I'm sure I've seen it elsewhere under some other name, but I can't remember what
  it was.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow, thanks Rainer. So, it seems like it is a legit design. Well, there you
    go. Thanks for the Ziggy link, Mike, but I don't think that's the one I was thinking
    of. That little curly foot on the cap A looks so familiar. You know when one character
    just jumps out? I just can't link the context.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again for
    your help."
