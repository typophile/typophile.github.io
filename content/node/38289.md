  body: "It is a hard one because it isn't a font. It was created by hand. The same
    letters don't match -- and even though many fonts have alternative letters (OT
    for a lot of scripts, and typositor in the old days) I don't think someone would
    have made this with the three different Es. \r\n\r\nPerhaps someone can figure
    out something similar and suggest it."
