  a tool that would allow tracking and kerning a text, but it would also allow sharing
  the final kerning values with other people. The typeface and the kerning pairs will
  be submitted into a central \"kerning repository\", and this repository is going
  to be openly accessible by everyone else. Then, when someone starts on kerning text
  set in the same type, he can use the repository entry as a starting point. \r\n\r\nMultiple
  entries for the same kerning pair can be order based on certain criteria, e.g. give
  a higher preference to the submissions of a certain user or that with a higher \"popularity
  index\".\r\n\r\nSo it is in its essence <em>a crowd-sourced kerning improvement
  project</em>.\r\n\r\nI am a programmer by trade and this is something that is not
  going to be that hard to write, so the prototype can be thrown together in a matter
  of few weeks.\r\n\r\nThoughts or comments ? \r\n\r\nNot considering the implementation
  details at the moment, does the <em>idea</em> have any practical value ? Or does
  it solve the problem that does not and will not exist ?\r\n"

  body: "The problem with this is that kerning is relative to size (among other things)
    and most designers aren\u2019t doing much kerning at text sizes. So the kerns
    I might output using Hypothetical Grotesk (I\u2019m trademarking that name, nobody
    use it!) at 24 points probably aren\u2019t relevant to Hypothetical Grotesk at
    120 points."

  body: "Seriously, what's wrong with just learning how to kern?\r\n\r\nMost of the
    time we only kern anything obvious - the bigger the copy, the more obvious the
    kerning issues. It's a good idea - but only if we spent all our time kerning body
    copy. Which we don't. At least, I don't.\r\n\r\nThe downside to automating every
    detail is that designers become complacent and altogether ignorant of spacing
    issues. Kerning type allows designers to fine tune their abilities to read the
    space and negative space between forms; Gain greater sensitivity towards the rhythm
    between shapes and relative color/value - useful skills for any designer."

  body: "> The problem with this is that kerning is relative to size.\r\n\r\nOK, I
    was under the impression that it wasn't that common.\r\n\r\n> Seriously, what\u2019s
    wrong with just learning how to kern?\r\n\r\nNothing, I'm all for it. But if there
    are obvious kerning issues in a specific type that <em>everyone</em> needs to
    fix, why not automate the process a bit ? An example that actually got me thinking
    in this direction is a W-e kerning in [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/centaur/fonts/|Centaur]].
    It's dead obvious that this pair should've been in the kerning table, but somehow
    it is not there.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm seeing things from programmer's perspective
    - if there's a repetitive task, it's a prime candidate for automation. At the
    very least you are going to be helping yourself so that you won't need to re-kern
    things when setting another text using the same font (but, say, on a different
    workstation).\r\n\r\n"

    issue you run into with this type of automation is that the character of one face

  body: "Sometimes hanging out with type designers -- and programmers -- is extremely
    frustrating. If only they had to use the products they make. If only they understood
    that kerning too must be an aesthetic matter.\r\n\r\n\"Must be\" since there is
    so much bad kerning coming from the designers/programmers, at least from the perspective
    of those who set text. I'll pass on the look of advertising type -- much of it
    looks similar to how the (human) models look after going through Photoshop. A
    case of every mom thinks her child is great?"

  body: "@phrostbyte64: the idea is not to develop universal kerning formula, it's
    the opposite - collect a set of manual kerning pairs sorted by the type (and perhaps
    by the size). At the very least this should allow tackle most obvious kerning
    issues in popular types.\r\n\r\n@charles: I can see it's a rant :-), but frankly
    I just don't understand what's it about."
