body: The image here is the back of a document from the mid 19th century. You can
  see that the page is blank except for a little sketch in the bottom corner of the
  page. We think someone was sketching out the imposition arrangement for a sheet
  for a printing job. Can anyone help interpret what imposition arrangement the sketch
  may be showing?

    side of it (bottom right hand corner) mark the front and back covers of an 8-
    or 16-page booklet. Or not: it might be an imposition layout for business cards,
    too...'

  body: "I agree with Nick -- it looks like a sketch for a 16-page imposition sheet
    (16 pages, as it shows half, then half, then half again, marking first and last
    page).\r\n\r\nIt looks much like the sketch I'd make for clients when they asked
    me what I was doing, back when I did manual imposition."
