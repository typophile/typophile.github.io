  the Serjeant gallery in Wanganui New Zealand.\r\nI am pretty sure the Rs and the
  J were customized-- but what typeface or font do you think was used as a reference
  to make the sign?\r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: "Lettering on building -- vintage one that is, not modern signs -- is often
    either custom designed or painted using models that often have no equivalent in
    'type'.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we can probably find similar stuff."

  body: Pieters right -- it is hand done -- -- but it must have been origianally drawn
    based on some font. I found Daily News and thought it was-close but no banana.

  body: "<em>(...) but it must have been originally drawn based on some font.</em>\r\n\r\nNot
    necessarily. Some of the models used by sign painters had absolutely nothing to
    do with fonts -- typefaces used in the printing industry. As those models may
    have had no equivalent with printing types, they could possibly be unknown to
    that (our) community. The same problem exists with alphabets for rubber stamps,
    license plates, road signage, sewing and other specific applications."

  body: "Even if it wasnt a font and it was a model-- I wish I could find that model...\r\n\r\nThe
    wedge shaped serifs, the point at the top of the A and the way the serifs on the
    E the T and the L point outwards-- remind me of the font Della Robia-- which was
    designed in 1902-- and the Serjeant Gallery was built in 1912. But Della Robia
    is much more expanded.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DellaRobbia_5043.gif]"

  body: Personally the classic structure and sharp serifs made me think of [[Nick
    Shinn]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=NS.112080.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SARJEANT+GALLERY&sampleSize=32">Beaufort</a>.
    Finding a match for that wonky R and J would be nice though. :^)

    way of forcing the letterform to be more like a Maori Koru---- maybe -- its done
    a lot here in New Zealand. \r\n\r\n"
