    about it... <BR> <BR>Could you put up a large character set? <BR> <BR>The Cyrillic:
    I&#39;m not qualified to say much, but I wonder, is this the &#34;cursive&#34;
    hand that&#39;s no longer in fashion? It reminds me a little bit of Pertsov Skoropis
    &#40;which won at the Kyrillitsa &#39;99 awards&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Beautiful, indeed! It&#39;s really quite lovely, and  <BR>for some reason,
    <A HREF="http://www.psyops.com/html/services.html" TARGET="_top">PsyOps</A> comes
    to mind if you&#39;re <BR>considering distribution. RXC doesn&#39;t just run a
    <BR>foundry, I hear he acts as a mentor for designers  <BR>with potential to produce
    some premium final  <BR>products. Give it some thought. <BR> <BR>I like the raised
    period for added handwritten <BR>feel, but maybe it&#39;s just a tad too high.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant is right, we need to see a full character <BR>set and maybe a bit
    larger to make up for the <BR>low-res of the Web. <BR> <BR>Great work, Andrij.
    There is a real shortage of <BR>modern handwritten scripts that really look like
    <BR>they were made by hand and not a computer.  <BR>Keep working toward that end
    and you&#39;ll have  <BR>something unique.

    <BR> <BR>i see that my love for curved ends of stems make for my bad effect especially

    for idea about PsyOps, very interesting link. but i think they haven&#39;t big
    interest for non-latin fonts. <BR> <BR>Hrant, about Pertsov Skoropis. Pertsov
    i think makes a modern look on old-styles &#40;before 1700&#41;official cyrillic
    writing.  <BR> <BR>i want make new script over traditional ukrainian handwriting,
