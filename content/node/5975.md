body: Help! Fontographer is driving me crazy because it keeps striping the dash between
  the typeface name and the style name on any font I modify that had the dash there
  originally. This is a huge problem because we need the fonts for Adobe Distiller
  which has to see the same font name as the input source to properly do font substitution.

    name window. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D
