body: "This is my first post... sorry to start off by just asking questions and looking
  for Font IDs, but apparently, that's how I roll. :)\r\n\r\nI am trying to find two
  different typefaces. \r\n\r\nThe first would be the typeface used in the \"district
  five\" logo. I am trying to find the typeface used for the \"american advertising
  association\" and word \"district\". I believe they are the same.\r\n\r\nThe second
  is the Rapha logo. I'm thinking it might actually just be handmade, like the Titleist
  logo (titleist.com) was... but thought I'd ask.\r\n\r\nAny help you might give would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nFlickster"
