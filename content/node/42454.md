  from a variety of sources and so quality varies greatly. Often I wonder if I should
  leave people alone or whether I should help nature out a bit: removing pimples,
  whitening teeth and generally make things look a bit more presentable. Is there
  an unspoken industry standard along the lines of, we do pimples but don't whiten
  teeth, we remove stray beard hairs but we don't take off kilos etc? \r\n\r\nIt's
  probably important to point out this is a pretty straight newsy newspaper \r\nvery
  curious,\r\nthoughts?\r\n\r\n--N"

    can remove it, not you. Remember the photog that was fired for adding an additional
    missile to a photo of an attack in the middle east. He no longer works there.

    you work for has a policy on the matter, and if it doesn't, maybe they will start
    one because of your question. And you don't own the newspaper, so the decision
    is not up to you. Also, don't forget that this forum is called Typophile -- you
    might find more knowledgeable opinions on a blog or forum about news design (for
    example, http://www.newsdesigner.com/blog/). \r\n\r\nLast but not least, I think
    that what other people have been saying here is pretty much the same: You don't
    make people look prettier for a news photo. It's not fashion photography, and
    it's not celebrity photography, nor is it some glossy magazine."

    newspaper, my feeling is that it is one thing to do color correction or contrast

  body: "<em>outside of the range of optimization for print and cropping,</em>\r\n\r\nThere's
    also a bit of design-driven \"cheating\" on optimization, which you can see by
    comparing the same shot (as occasionally happens) on the front page of different
    papers. Typically, there is a figure in the foreground which the editors would
    like to stand out from the visual noise; so a cropping mask is drawn, and filters
    applied to the differentiated areas, adjusting blur/sharpness, colour and tone.\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of enhancement, *focus*, or selection may be compared with the shooter adjusting
    depth of field to get the subject to stand out."

    That means you may offset the ten pounds the camera adds, and lighten the teeth
    so they look as white as the do in person, but no more.\r\n\r\nSo, basically,
    remove artifacts if you want, but nothing else."

    stuff seems OK to me as well. From Nick's suggestions it seems to be a rule of
    thumb that anything that could conceivably done (within reason!) in camera is
    probably OK to replicate in the 'shop. I imagine there is a certain degree of
    flexibility to be creative with feature stories / analysis but perhaps it needs
    to say somewhere that it's manipulated art and it also probably needs to be a
    significantly and obviously new creation rather then the Vanity fair nip-tuck.\r\n\r\nScott,
    maybe your point gets back to the original question of whitening teeth and removing
    blemishes. It is true that you can do this with makeup (maybe not the teeth) but
    it seems that most people so far wouldn't do this with newsy stories. \r\nI still
    wonder whether the designer can resist the urge to have a quiet tweak...\r\nthanks
