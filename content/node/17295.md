body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : Graham Type Foundry</strong>\r\n\r\n\t\r\nThis
  foundry was founded by type designer [[John Graham]] (1851-?). Graham originally
  worked in a printing office and later went to work for [[MacKellar Smiths and Jordan|MacKellar,
  Smiths & Jordan]] working on specimen books. At night he studied drawing and letter
  design, and bought engraving tools and taught himself type cutting. The foundry
  encouraged his efforts and in 1882 he joined the [[Marder Luse Foundry]] in Chicago
  where he cut Spinner Script and Spinner Script No. 2, and some sizes of Inclined
  Program. He cut a minion size map font for the Illinois Type Foundry, and eventually
  started the Graham foundry, cutting borders and ornaments primarily, which were
  highly successful. "
