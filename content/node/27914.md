  body: "In general, I like what you have here, but I have a thing for fonts that
    are constrained by a geometric rule. Indeed, I do most of my own desigining with
    one. Casual and Club intentionally, flow from one character to the next and, in
    most cases, make a word to appear as a single undulating form. Which, in itself,
    is not a bad plan, but it does hinder legibility.\r\nAlso, the ascenders in Club
    look like penises."
