I have got no clue, though, as to which is the price range for fonts. Can I get some insight into this? I would appreciate it a lot.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Viejo, how much money you make from a font usually depends on how popular the font turns out to be, i.e., how many copies of the font will be sold. <BR> <BR>Most foundries pay a specific commission to the designer for each sale they make; a percentage. The important thing to keep in mind is the question: &quot;how much mileage is this foundry going to give my font?&quot; Let's say that one foundry offers you 25%, and a second just 15%.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I couldn't agree more. When I was just getting into digital type sales in the early 90s, I assumed that any reasonably decent font would sell at least 10,000 copies at retail. Even then, I was told, 200 copies was considered hugely successful at retail.  <BR> <BR>Given how hard it is to sell large numbers of fonts retail, your royalty isn't the important thing: getting promoted is. Yet who is really doing promotion today?  <BR> <BR>Corporate sales are the way to go, but do you have  a product that a corporation will like well enough to pay let us say $80,000 for a 10,000 seat license?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I'm going to try and guess what Stephen is talking about. <BR> <BR>FontShop Berlin publishes a large, many-page full color newletter. Often. Maybe every month even. German designers seem to swear by these things, although all other German foundries cut these out of their budgets years ago because they did not generate sales anymore (yeah internet!). I must admit that the FS Berlin mail is very well designed, and presents the typefaces of many foundries, not just FontFont's, in a very good light. <BR> <BR>Perhaps this will be picked up by FS SF.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your commments. Do you have any good or bad experience with the Scriptorium foundry? That was my first choice due to the nature of my project. I am doing some analysis on mexican hand-lettering and on mexican/spanish vintage type and lettering (from the previous three centuries). I want to make an interpretation of those letters in order to create a set. The people at Scriptorium were interested in the project, but I want to know a little bit more about the normal price paid for such things. <BR> <BR>Allan Haley, at Monotype, kindly answered to me on this subject: <BR> <BR>&quot;Hello Mosh, <BR> <BR>The price of font can range from &quot;free&quot; to over $100. Generally, they run from $22 to $49. We price the new releases into the ITC and Monotype libraries at $39 and $55 for OpenType. <BR> <BR>Royalties are paid on fonts sold. We make royalty payments quarterly.&quot; <BR> <BR>Is this an OK price? I had thought that it would be more, but if that's the standard, I'll accept it. <BR> <BR>I am still doing my first sketches on this project, though. I am mexican, but I am living since six months ago in Munich, Germany, so I am resourcing to my personal photo archive for sources. <BR> <BR>And H</div>
