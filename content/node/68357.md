  in 'Arial Unicode MS' font gets rendered correctly in Firefox, IE, MS Word etc,
  text is rendered incorrectly in Photoshop CS3 (using the same font).\r\n\r\nPlease
  see visual differences in this image. Please scroll it horizontally.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unicode-error-photoshop_3932.PNG]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
  irony is that this text is rendered correctly in 'layer name'. Please see this image.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unicode-error-photoshop2_6717.PNG]\r\n\r\n\r\nI've
  also tried all the combinations available in 'opentype' menu but still no luck.
  In fact most of the options are grayed out. Please see this image.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unicode-error-photoshop3_4143.PNG]\r\n
  \r\n\r\nIt truly seems some problem related to 'Ligatures' but only one ligature
  option ie 'Standard Ligatures' was available. Turning on/off that option didn't
  help either."

  body: Have you tried this in Illustrator using the glyph palette? You might then
    be able to copy the type or the outlines over to PS.

    supports Indic scripts from version CS4 and beyond with the aid of specialized
    templates.

    because the \"layer\" name is rendered via XP renderer.\r\n\r\nIf you only need
    those two words, you should use our backwards compatibility non-Unicode font \"Sanskrit
    99\" downloadable at my Sanskrit website here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/#SANS99\r\n\r\nAfter
    having installed this font, which also works with non-Unicode-savvy Adobe applications,
    enter the following\r\n\r\nijteN\xD4 k\u2026mar\r\n\r\nand mark it up with the
    \"Itranslator 99\" font. That's it.\r\n\r\nThe result should look like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chillingeffects.de/temp4.jpg\r\n"

  body: what do you need to recreate? you can use the existing templates and save
    them as documents that preserve the correct script shaping or as new templates
    according to your specifications.
