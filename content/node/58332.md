    Maybe because it feels more retro and the latest feels too modern for the Lakers.
    \r\nKeep in mind though my largest exposure to the Lakers was in \"Look Who's
    Talking 2\" in the early 90's."

    huh!</strong>\r\nDamn straight man!  Lakers are the shiznit.  They give meaning
    to my life.\r\n\r\n<strong> >>>> I\u2019m not liking the silver though. Earlier
    version is better...it much cleaner & straight forward.</strong>\r\n I somewhat
    agree, but I'm trying to make 'Lakers' and 'Ground' stand out from one another.
    \ I haven't found a great way to do it yet, especially against a dark background.\r\n\r\n<strong>
    >>>> btw...you run lakersground.net forum?</strong>\r\nI'd like to think I do
    but there's a number of people who put more time and effort there than I do.  But
    in my head they all do my bidding for me."

    I guess it'll be ok if you're only changing the logo not the entire website and

    larger than LAKERS in this last version.\r\n\r\nIs the K a little narrow?"
