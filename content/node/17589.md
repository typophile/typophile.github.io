body: "although this is a logo (attempt), it really represents my first foray into
  non-pixel based type design.\r\n\r\nthe result of this first effort is nothing spectacular,
  and yet i need some feedback to see if my instincts are good or bad.\r\n\r\nitem
  1 is a direct adaptation of one of my pixel fonts.\r\nitem 2 adds perfect circles
  into the mix\r\nitem 3 airs everything out\r\nitem 4 adds some flair to the interior
  shapes and trims the horizontal elements\r\nitem 5 is a step in the wrong direction\r\n\r\ni'm
  going to continue working on this logo until i get it right: i'm not going to shop
  for a font that might fit the words. why? because i need to make the leap into bezier
  designs sooner or later, and i've been putting it off for a long time.\r\n\r\nthat
  said, if anyone has suggestions on creative directions i might take, i'm all ears.
  i'm looking for something modern, but not necessarily cold. i want panache, without
  being cute or clever, and i want a semi-bold look.\r\n\r\ntrust me when i say i
  do not mean to imply that this first step of mine embodies all the qualities i just
  listed. it is, as i mentioned, just my first stab at things.\r\n\r\nthe logo and
  tag will probably go something like this: set your image apart. the idea being,
  a uniquely edited photo catalog is available here.\r\n\r\nany help, as always, is
  considered a supreme act of friendship.\r\n\r\n:)"

    member dimensions.\r\n\r\nsee logo 3"

  body: "more changes.\r\n\r\nplaying with spacing, possible lowercase forms, and
    in item 10, slight rotations of the inner elements of the characters.\r\n\r\ni
    think item 10 has the most style, even if it is a well-worn type style. didn't
    photodisc have a logo in the same letter style? i tried to google it, but came
    up zeros."

  body: "Without knowing what the logo has to do, the nature of the company/product
    etc. I think item 7 is a good starting point, the change of case aids pronounciation.
    I am not keen on the tails of the 'lit' group they are too contrasted and uniform
    and I wonder if they are all necessary, if you amended them to a heavier stroke
    and more of a geometric shape to match the characteristics of the others, the
    'l' tail should be shorter than that of the 't', you might even be able to lose
    it on the 'i' (which seems too tall and looks better with the round dot). The
    'n' needs some work on the inside of its counter and I think you should look at
    the relation of vertical element and counter in the 'p' and 'a'. Finally, Photopolitan
    has some of the properties of the OHOHO kerning exercise, the kerning will have
    to be loosened a touch, especially for small use.\r\nHope this of some use.\r\nTim"

    body: "tim,\r\n\r\nthanks for your help. i've done the best i can interpreting
      your advice, but there are a few areas i'm sure i've missed the mark, despite
      my own efforts.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure how this is all working. i liked it at first,
      but there isn't a real flow within the word visually, and i don't know how to
      fix that, other than to try a completely different style.\r\n\r\nthe name is
      a stock photography and illustration brand. i am hoping to find a balance between
      strong geometric shapes, with a little flair thrown in; a few sexy curves.\r\n\r\nhence
      my first attempts.\r\n\r\nplease, anyone who can offer some suggestions or perspective,
      please send them: i need the help!\r\n\r\nlatest versions are up."

  body: "I quite liked the very first version of the logo type shown in the first
    image\r\n\r\nWith the latest versions I think you have to be careful with the
    widths at the joins of the 'p', the 'a', as these currently look too black and
    too 'blotchy' / blurry\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "dav,\r\n\r\nyou are the master of the style i'm shooting for here. your letterforms
    in many cases strike me as barren in their origin, mathematical. but by the time
    you are done sculpting them, they strike the perfect balance between algorithm
    and poem.\r\n\r\njust my opinion, of course, there are many here on these boards
    who are more in tune with our work than i, no doubt. regardless, i am glad to
    have your feedback.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\ni'm thinking that photopolitan might be both
    too long and perhaps a little to clever (or maybe not clever enough) to work as
    i'd like it to. so as of now, i'm changing the name to 'phoda'. two syllables,
    and a little better symmetry within the word.\r\n\r\nof the designs on the latest
    post, i think i like 1a the best. it's funky (the stems), impersonal (outer bowls),
    and yet, still curvaceous in the inner bowls.\r\n\r\ni'm looking for the suggestion
    of individuality through an otherwise faceless environment."

  body: "To me the h is too wide and the stroke contrast is too great. The top right
    quadrant of the a looks a bit light. The d seems to have a shorter ascender than
    the h. As Dav says, the stems are creating dark areas, which is making the o look
    lighter than the other characters. I think that overall you can reduce the stroke
    contrast and reduce the angle of the stems or adjust the counters to compensate
    for the weight and angle of the stems.\r\nTim"
