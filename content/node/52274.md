body: "I am looking for a font to use for the identity of a new boutique hotel that
  is all about a modern take on 'old world' it needs to be a great family that is
  versatile like Mercury by Hoefler Frere Jones. I need a capital M with diagonal
  legs like the capital M in Calligraph 810, but don't like it to look like it was
  calligraphy.... Please help?\r\n\r\n\r\nEben\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2d92ecd53cfbf34193836eb106e01a_6313.png]"

  body: "- What city?\r\n- What kind of people are supposed to stay there?\r\n- What
    does the building look like?\r\n\r\nBTW, if you find a font that you really like
    but it has a non-splayed \"M\", you could always just make a splayed one - or
    pay a pro to do it, since it's tricky - in fact it's technically the most difficult
    Latin cap letter. Usually I myself make complete fonts, but last year I made a
    custom \"C\" for a restaurant in Singapore: http://www.manic.com.sg/work_macaron.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
