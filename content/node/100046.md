  or Bodoni modified?\r\n\r\nAnyway the main font I really want to know about is the
  sans-serif font that they have in their magazine and all over the place. It's wide
  and reminds me of ITC Avant Garde but then the \"R\" looks much different and the
  overall appearance is not exactly the same. What font is it?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n"

    masthead is, as you said, most probably a custom job and Didot is probably the
    closest you could get. You can try [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/italian-didot/|Italian

  body: Thanks! Do you know of any fonts that are similar to Vogue Avant-Garde? I
    like that it mixes the ideas of Avant-Garde and Futura.
