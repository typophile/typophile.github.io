body: 'The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society &#40;NPLHS&#41; are constructing a &#34;complete
  17th-century version of the fabled <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/contest.html"><i>Necronomicon</i></a>!
  Using a comprehensive set of custom-designed vintage fonts, artwork and text.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>While the contest is related to writing passages, it&#39;d be interesting
  to see &#40;from a typographer&#39;s standpoint&#41; whether their version would
  stand up to the rigorous scrutiny of the Typophiles. <BR> <BR>Their goal is to make
  it a downloadable PDF that could be printed and bound &#40;so I guess it&#39;ll
  be only so realistic&#41;. But they have some example <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/woodcuts.html">woodcuts</a>,
  <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/deccaps.html">decorative intitial
  caps</a>, <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/pagedecs.html">page
  decorations</a> and some example <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/NconSamples.pdf">PDF
  pages</a>. They seem to be mining the real thing for their facsimile, but I&#39;m
  sure they&#39;re slipping up a few times. The PDF is a good way to scrutinize. <BR>
  <BR>If you&#39;re not familiar, here&#39;s some <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/9879/nechist.htm">info
  on <i>The Necronomicon</i></a> from the man himself, H.P. '

  body: One of the people involved with this &#40;possibly the only one&#41; is the
    talented prop maker <a href="http://www.ahleman.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Leman</a>.
    He&#39;s really into this stuff, so I would think it would at least <i>appear</i>
    to be authentic, even if it&#39;s completely concocted. <BR> <BR>I heard from
    him after writing my article about the use of type in movies &#40;<a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/typecasting.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>&#41;. He seems to be one of the few people working in
    Hollywood who cares about type. He recently started selling some of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/ephemera/"
    target="_blank">his fonts</a> on MyFonts, too.

    <BR>Anyway, Aren&#39;t you supposed to go crazy if you read it?

    <BR> <BR>Nope, but last time someone read the Necronomicon, shadows fell over
    the quiet city of Dunwich...'

  body: You only go crazy if you &#42;understand&#42; it. Luckily for me, I don&#39;t
    read Latin at all. <BR> <BR>As for the HPLHS and fonts, I&#39;ve evaluated some
    of their freeware stuff, and it was pretty abysmal. Bad enough that I decided
    not to give them feedback because I didn&#39;t know where to start. They needed
    basic ideas like sidebearings sorted out. You can see this in the sample above.
    Compare the b-long-s pair with the &#34;is&#34; or &#34;os&#34; pairs. <BR> <BR>That
    aside, these folks are great, and some of their other stuff is truly wonderful.
    I have bought quite a few copies of the &#34;Shoggoth on the Roof&#34; CD &#40;though
    beware of imperfect reproductions&#41;. They also have tons of cool resources
    for live-action Call of Cthulhu role-playing. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: The long s, just like the f, was kerned in old typefaces. That's why there
    were lots of ligatures involving the long s.
