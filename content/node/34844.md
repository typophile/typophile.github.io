  like to collect some interesting and unusual uses of theses fonts beyond the usual
  web, and on-screen use. For example Tahoma in Dutch passports seems a wonderfully
  out of place usage given the country\u2019s own type design heritage. Any examples
  you could share, or loan (pics or the real thing) would be appreciated. Heck, I\u2019ll
  even throw in a prize for the most obscure!"
