body: "I came across this sign in Zurich, Switzerland. It's not one of the official
  signage typefaces used in the past. The sign is for the real estate administration
  of the city, but is not using Helvetica, the official typeface used by the city.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for the typeface in the middle, although the title seems to be the same.
  It's not Aurora Grotesk, by the way.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://thierryblancpain.com/files/grabup/9p/nx4vkj75s0sg4.png\"

  body: "The bolder letters may not <strong>be</strong> Aurora Grotesk Bold, but they
    certainly appear to be <strong>based</strong> on it\u2014or, at least, the 1928
    C. E. Weber release of same.\r\n\r\nThis sign was most likely silk-screened, so
    whoever cut or burned the stencil for the sign may have made a few amendments
    to an existing design\u2014most notably, rounding the D a bit."

  body: thanks. do you have a scan of that 1928 release? the scans i've seen (and
    dada grotesk, which is based on it) have quite the different lowercase 'a', although
    there's a definitive relation between aurora and this.

  body: "the specimen of the Weber release in <em>Encyclop\xE6dia of Type Faces</em>\u2014which
    reads <strong>Das Bauhaus De</strong>\u2014shows a slightly flatter top on the
    /a/, and a more pronounced trap at the bottom where the bowl meets the stem. But\u2014again\u2014if
    the stencil was hand-cut, the artist may have taken a few other liberties besides
    making the /D/ less boxy."

  body: you're right, there are quite a few irregularities in there. i guess it was
    a sloppy hand-cut of aurora then, most likely. thanks!
