  than a name of a specific font, so i know what to search for for other examples.\r\n\r\nIt's
  the typeface used in the Harley Davidson Fit Shop logo (I think now former logo)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.americanharley-davidson.com/images/SlideShow/promo-SlideShow/image2.jpg\r\n\r\nI've
  tried things like gothic sans, vintage... even 'motorcycle fonts' and 'manly fonts'\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot\r\n\r\n"
