  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, I'm working on a mark for a contractor that installs high quality custom kitchen and bathroom counters, Stone & Wood Concepts. They lean towards a look that incorporates a monogram so I've been playing with these ideas based loosely on the "counter" idea with S & W, I like the concept but none of these seem to be quite working. Any thoughts/ideas to possibly tweak these or take it a different direction? Thanks.

		<div class="commentbody">To me, these are a little too modular- and techno-looking to represent "high quality". I'd go in a different direction.

If I were creating a brand for a company with such a generic name, I'd have some fun with a (non-typographic) mark, and use very simple typography. But if they requested a monogram, then...

Try playing with type that defies expectations. Granite is heavy and rigid, so maybe go with a thin, rounded sans. I don't know... just a suggestion. Let's hear what the others have to say.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Lex. They haven't specifically requested a monogram, but several examples they liked were marks incorporating monograms. I like the idea of a a mark with type, just a matter of finding a way to represent granite/counters.

Agreed that it does come off as a bit too modular, this is one of those that looked much better as a napkin sketch than drawn mark :) </div>

See if you can make the 'S' look like an 'S' when viewed from the southeast, and a 'W' when viewed from the southwest.

Also, make sure you have a version that works in one colour.

Also, to help with it reading as a 'w', you might consider cutting the left corner at a 45 degree angle. Could be a bad suggestion, but might be worth a shot.

Concept-wise I don't think this approach's working. This logo seems to be about etching, or at the very least precise metal work. Certainly not the granite countertops.

Have you considered abstracting a (round) lip of a countertop into a mark somehow ? </div>

I've actually been sketching a variety of attempts on that (counter lip) for a while now. A few rough ideas, any of them grab you?

IMO, it needs more breathing room overall. Those white slivers won't hold up, and currently it feels more crowded than it feels fitted together like cabinets. Have you thought about making the bottom of the s and the w feel more "cabinet-like" somehow? Perhaps subtle faceted corners? Or off-black inlaid panels? I might surf around on Home Depot and look at cabinetry a bit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your last one, sans the mark in the middle is likely a more appropriate solution for the problem.

Going back to my earlier comment, I think the mark's aesthetic should hint at craftsmanship. 

I like a lot of the SW monograms you created, but I don't think that approach makes as much sense as a nicely typeset mark.

I'm not sure you need to literally represent countertops, either. Could a tagline along the lines of 'fine cabinetry and kitchen surfaces' work? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree on the aesthetic, I feel like the client really wants some sort of a mark go to with a typographic treatment, however. I do like the general feel of the type on these later ones, however, you think there's a way to integrate a mark into that? I think the craftsmenship/quality idea is on the right track, but I'm having a hard time visually representing that.

When talking with the client, they were key to emphasize that they weren't the cheapest option out there, but they were quality and did things right the first time (as the contractor business here in Houston, post-hurricane, is filled with a lot of fly-by-night operations). A tagline might work, but their business is primarily in the countertop part of the job and not the cabinets/carpentry aspect.

Marco, understand your thought there, thanks. Think I'm kind of looking away from that direction now though.</div>

Special-K: I'm definitely not opposed to trying a different ampersand with a bit more visual mass, but that one is a bit too decorative for the overall identity I think.

Sounds like no one is big on the icon, which is at least good to know. I'd like to offer them a choice with a mark as well as just the type, however, we'll see what turns up with some more sketching.</div>

Ed, good observation, I'm still playing with the kerning a bit and will definitely tweak the final and get some feedback before moving on the business card and site design. And I've been back and forth on the optical center as well, I think it may be as close as I can get it there unless you've got ideas?

The client liked the ampersand and "concepts" but wanted to see a few more type options so I gave him a few, these do still have some kerning issues that I'll work on once we've chosen a final direction. Here's hoping he stays with the original.

What if the ampersand was set inside a slice of log or carved into a stone (perhaps used interchangeably).

That might bring back the literal icon a bit.

I think the client is smart to go light colored for note taking and like your idea of 2-sided card (if budget allows, but b-card printing is so cheap these days one would think that would be doable).

Or--if I may toss out even more ideas way late in the game (and this one might be very cheesy so take it with a grain of salt)--what if one side was set with some element of wood grain and the reverse some element of stone texture?</div>

You can always laminate black onto white. Black for presentation, white for the notes.

Wouldn't this look a bit cheesy though ? I mean it can be pulled off, but it is going to be rather hard.</div>

(I don't think letter pressing would be an option anymore)

Also, I don't know what they charge for custom jobs, and I don't know how many cards you're looking at having printed, but this place seems to be pretty reasonable for their letterpress jobs: [[http://themandatepress.com/|The Mandate Press]].

Playing with a bit of a different color palette in the same format as the other card. Probably need to brighten up the tan color a bit.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card_4886.png]

Alternatively, start with the same padding on the left and at the bottom, right-align WOOD and .com and then set the top padding to that at the right edge.

Also, color-wise - I think the & is still a bit too dark, though the perception of it certainly depends on the calibration of the monitor.</div>

Where they did f#ck up is in placing your logo on the website and impersonating another company. This is fraud and it is typically sufficient to file a complaint with godaddy.com (their domain registrant) and have their registration nullified.

In short - take the screenshots of the website, archive them and file a complaint with godaddy.com, detailing the exact circumstances. Talk to your lawyer.

I've been talking with a good friend of mine who just happens to have recently graduated law school with a specialty in intellectual property (convenient).
