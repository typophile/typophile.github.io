  body: "First, let's define workhorse. For me, it means (a) there are at least three
    weights with italic for each; (b) it's a serif family, because sans-serifs, in
    corporate work, are used as a secondary or highlight font, one that harmonizes
    with the primary serif family; (c) the x-height is high enough to permit the base-weight
    roman to bloom at 9 pt, whereas many of our flavor-of-the-month fonts bloom at
    10pt or higher; (c) the base weight is strong, contrasted, and dark enough to
    be crisp and legible at 6pt, which similarly leaves off many fashionable fonts:
    in particular, the finer serifs have to hold up clearly as the point size goes
    down; (d) the italics have to match the romans in their proportions, unlike, say,
    Gill's Joanna; and (e) both oldstyle and liner figures are available and can be
    alternated easily.\r\n\r\nFor me, the perfect workhorse, fulfilling all these
    requirements, is Stone Serif (from ITC, not Adobe), with Stone Sans as the perfect
    sans-serif foil. It blooms at 9pt, there are three weights, all well contrasted
    from each other, and the italics look even better than the romans. Also, the letterforms
    are fat instead of slightly condensed. Warnock, for instance, is a fine workhorse
    for all these reasons, but I place it below Stone because, like Minion, its letterforms
    are slightly condensed in look producing, for my eyes, a cramped look in texts.
    Galliard would be a workhorse for me if its italics were not so fussy--but otherwise
    I admire it greatly.\r\n\r\nYou choose a workhorse family for organizational work
    because coherent corporate design requires one primary serif text family for everything,
    punctuated by one well-matched sans-serif text family for highlights and sidebars.
    This is the classic approach, and it's classic for damned good reasons that hold
    up over time."

  body: "What are the reasons that a lot of Slimbach's faces are considered \"workhorses\"?\r\n\r\nThere's
    little to criticize, all of them being utterly consistent and clean in their details
    and their construction. They hold up well under almost all situations, and if
    push came to shove, any number of them could be relied up to do a steady, serviceable
    job on almost any job.\r\n"

  body: "For me a workhorse font also has to have either open type or a full expert
    set. (As I've said before) I design a lot of cookbooks and art books and the former
    especially can require a lot of different variations within the font, fractions,
    small caps, various weights. A workhorse font (for me) also doesn't call too much
    attention to itself.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the Stone family aesthetically. Depending
    on my purposes I might use Adobe Garamond or Caslon or Jensen Pro. I might also
    use Thesis, which nicely has both sans and serif. Other fonts that serve this
    purpose for me have included Bembo, Bulmer, Dante, Columbus, Fournier, Perpetua,
    Sabon. There are plenty of others that I don't have licensed. Stefan Hattenbach
    has fleshed out his font families very nicely.\r\n\r\nFor sans I often turn to
    Meta (haven't purchased the Serif yet). Klavika if I want something more modern."
