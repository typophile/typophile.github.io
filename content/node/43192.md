  just graphic designers? \r\n\r\nWhere is their point of view?\r\n\r\nMikey :-|\r\n\r\nPS...
  this is not about the African American brain or anything like that- so don't go

  body: This comes up now and then and I have to say it is kind of surprising that
    African-Americans seem underrepresented in the field of design. I think it seems
    especially conspicuous because of the gargantuan contributions of African-Americans
    in just about every area of American culture in the Twentieth Century.
