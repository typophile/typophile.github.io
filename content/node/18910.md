  had to share it. If you can stand to actually read the copy, it gets funnier (and
  in many ways sadder) as you go.\r\n\r\nI remember years ago there was a big concern
  about \"desktop publishers\" proliferating the world with <strong>bad design</strong>
  and undermining the design profession's reputation and cankering the value we provide
  our clients. I think it is pretty obvious that clients that would use the type of
  service above, aren't the clients I/we look for. \r\n\r\nMaybe it has been simply
  my own maturation process, but I think it there has been an industry wide shift
  in our definition of ourselves, and subsequently the way our clients perceive our
  value. We are not wrists that simply push type and pixels around on a screen, but
  we are strategists, visual and emotional anthropologists, interpreters and above
  all communicators. \r\n\r\nSorry for the mini-manifesto.\r\n\r\nJ."

    You don't really need to have \"great artistic talent\" to create junk-mail."
