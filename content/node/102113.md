body: "Hello Typohphiles,\r\nI am pretty new as a contributor to the font world and
  was hoping some more experienced members could point me in the right direction.
  I recently released a font which has gleaned a lot of attention and now a major
  US broadcaster is requesting to license it for use as a logo for a television show,
  for US audience only, for one season for now.\r\n\r\nI really have no idea how I
  should be calculating licensing fees for something like this, or what is appropriate.
  I neither want to overcharge nor undersell myself on this. The only point of reference
  I have found is the broadcast license [[http://www.typotheque.com/licensing/broadcasting|calculator
  on Typoteque]], which feels high to me, but at the same time I am sure the broadcaster
  is dealing with huge budgets.\r\n\r\nCan anyone provide insight, or point me in
  a direction with more info on licensing and fees?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

    need to actually license the font for broadcast. Thanks for the answers! I am
    still curious to know the pricing standards for that sort of licensing though..."

  body: "So they're not actually licensing the font, right? They just want to pay
    you to use a logo made with the font. Which I presume makes the Typoteque reference
    moot.\r\n\r\nSatya, many font EULAs don't require any special permission for that
    sort of thing* but let's assume Eli's does. So, how much to charge? I think a
    beginner should think of it this way: if you ask too little, you just lost some
    money; if you ask too much, you just lost some highly valuable exposure, including
    a chance for more business from the client. Also keep in mind that big companies
    got that way by not wasting money. How unique is your font? Remember, there's
    no copyright protection for actual font designs. If it costs them less to start
    from scratch, using somebody who's already on salary... The work for Disney that
    I once used to do (before they had to tighten their belts) always involved fixing
    a mess made by an in-house \"type designer\" (using the term loosely); whenever
    I pitched the idea of a custom font they looked at me funny.\r\n\r\n* Which however
    doesn't stop some companies from insisting on paying you something for some sort
    of official agreement, so you can't sue them later.\r\n\r\nBTW please do share
    your results here!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I have not come across many (if any) foundries specifying broadcast licensing,
    so the Typotheque example is intriguing. In a lot of cases licensing outside of
    predictable and well understood environments varies greatly between foundries,
    at least partly as a result of the font data often being distributed with the
    content it is being used to display. I am not familiar with the technology used
    to generate broadcast typography and whether this puts the font data at risk,
    so perhaps it comes down to a matter of exposure? House Industries take an approach
    to logo usage that considers the gross revenue of a company or of a movie that
    the font is used to promote:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><em>Logo Usage and Product for
    Sale</em>\r\n<ul><li>There is no additional charge for companies under $5 million
    (US Dollars) in annual gross revenue. If the logo has a specific application for
    a business within another company, then use the estimated gross revenue for that
    venture. For example a logo for a major motion picture would be priced on the
    movie gross, not the studio gross.</li>\r\n<li>$5 million to $10 million: $5000</li>\r\n<li>$10
    million to $50 million: $10,000</li>\r\n<li>$50 million and over: $15,000</li></ul></blockquote>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/licensing/pricing"

  body: Yes, I still don't quite understand the intricacies of licensing. From what
    I have read on the forums here, whatever price is paid for the EULA should allow
    the font to be used to produce unrestricted any sort of printed product, so long
    as the font software itself is not distributed with the product. With that said
    though, I recently had a large music publisher approach me to license this same
    font for use on an album cover for a significantly greater price (of their own
    naming) than the typical EULA cost. The licensing was not for multiple users or
    anything like that, but pertained specifically to the font's use on the cover
    of this album, which makes me wonder if this is common practice for large corporations?

  body: We have had fonts used as title logos for TV, books and comic books as well
    as being used for secondary titles in programs. We have always just charged the
    shelf price. Of course we would like to charge more. Who doesn't want more money
    for the same product. It just doesn't seem wise or appropriate.

  body: "I don\u2019t charge extra or require a special broadcast license either.
    Same for logos. \r\n\r\nI sort of get why people do it, that one should treat
    fonts like stock illustration or photography, that fonts should cost more when
    they are central to a design or product. But it seems shortsighted. \r\n\r\nI
    strongly believe that prominent use of a font is the best ways to create demand.
    Therefore, I <em>want</em> people to use my fonts in logos and on TV shows and
    movies. Why would I risk discouraging that by charging more? I don\u2019t believe
    I\u2019m \u201Cleaving money on the table\u201D in the long run."
