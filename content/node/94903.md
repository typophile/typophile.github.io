    further inspection, the typeface itself might reasonably be described as advertised,
    but only if you're talking about Orange Sunshine, and only if you're talking about
    half a tab.\r\n\r\nIf you know what I mean, which you shouldn't if you're well
    behaved, but\u2014hey! Hrant is in the house, so you know \"good deportment\"
    is off the table...\r\n\r\nJust trying to help you keep in the competition, buddy\u2026"

    don't always go hand in hand\u2014especially if you happen to drive in really
    scary traffic, like we have in the Washington, DC area.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not,
    there are some people who believe that, if traffic laws are not strictly enforced,
    neither are the laws of physics. Which would be okay if such scofflaws might end
    up killing only themselves; unfortunately, that's not always the way it works.

    discovered the fonts you have designed.  You are quite good at this thing.  I
    have always loved the American speed limit sign font, as you riffed off of for
    your Outer Loop.  Those letters are very elegant, but not fey; smooth, but not
    playful.  They are incredibly legible as well, even at the smallest point sizes.
    \ The offical URW version doesn't come with any lowercase, though there is Saa
    EM D, that does have miniscules, though the font is slightly wider and bolder.\r\n\r\nI
    also think your Decimosexto is very good."

  body: "Ryan,\r\n\r\nThank you for those kind words. My core mission is to share
    the love\u2026and make a few bucks doing it\u2026because you gotta eat\u2026and
    pay the rent\u2026and all of the other stuff which, unfortunately, you need money
    to buy.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of sharing the love, I gave a lot of free fonts away for
    awhile\u2014as did a great many other folks\u2014to share the love (and let me
    perfect my craft without charging people to buy my mistakes), until the good folks
    at ITC taught me that there was a buck to be made\u2026because you know why. And
    a wonderful lady named Ilene Strizver taught me how the pros did it. More love
    shared, more opportunities to spread the love.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are
    people ought there who thought that THEY ought to make a buck off all this love-sharing.
    For a time, I offered all of my free fonts on my website. The crooks, rather than
    simply downloading the fonts and posting them on their ad-supported sites, instead
    hot-linked to my site\u2014which, at the time was metered. When it ended up costing
    me $800 in one year to share the love because these assholes were hijacking my
    bandwidth, I called off the lovefest. I know it sucks, but I get the message:
    \"No good deed goes unpunished.\"\r\n\r\nSo, live and learn. But, I am thinking,
    it would be really nice if some\u2014if not all\u2014of the folks I shared the
    love with showed a little of THEIR love by sending me one lousy dollar as a token
    of their appreciation.\r\n\r\nHow many people is that? Hard to tell but, best
    I can figure, it's about three million people\u2014maybe more, but certainly not
    a whole lot less. Since that number will be multiplied by one, it is not hard
    to do the math. If everyone who benefited from my love-sharing ponied up a lousy
    buck to show their appreciation, I could give ALL of my good stuff away for free\u2026every
    last bit of it, and STILL have more money than I could possibly spend sensibly.\r\n\r\nIf
    it comes to that, however, I will be sure to program it http referrer, and keep
    the jerks from making me pay AGAIN for simply sharing the love.\r\n\r\nSo, as
    you can see, MY experiences with Orange Sunshine have left me a little loopy\u2026\r\n\r\nP.S.
    If I ever do initiate this cockamamie scheme, I have GOT to get PayPal to turn
    off email notification below a certain threshold, because I DO NOT want to end
    up being pissed off because THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH GOOD NEWS in my inbox. If you
    catch my drift\u2026\r\n\r\nWhich you will, Ryan, because you have been there
    and done that\u2026"

    yet. Consider this fair warning.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for people to end up
    scratching their heads and saying, \"What the HELL just happened?\" virtually
    anytime I pass on through, spreading the love. Or the fertilizer. Take your pick.
    I prefer the former. But, WYSIWYG\u2026\r\n\r\nTwenty-three skidoo!"
