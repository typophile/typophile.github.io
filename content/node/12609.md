  designer, typographical theorist, type designer. Born 1902. Died 1974.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nTschichold
  was born in Leipzig in 1902, the son of a signwriter. He trained in graphic arts
  and book crafts in Leipzig. Working in Munich in the 1920s, Tschichold was a pioneer
  of the so-called \"New Typography\"--a modernist, Bauhaus-inspired movement which
  had no truck with \"artistic\" typography, preferring plain sans-serif letters,
  rational assymetric layout, strict functionalism and industrial standardization.
  Tchichold's book, <cite>Die neue Typographie</cite> is still a readable and instructive
  explanation of this approach.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi party came to power in Germany in
  1933. Tschichold was arrested and lost his teaching job. In due course he emigrated
  to Switzerland, where (with brief interludes) he spent the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nFrom
  the 1940s onwards, Tschichold's style changed: he turned away from asymmetry and
  modernism towards \"classical\" typography in a style inspired by the renaissance
  printers: centred layouts, serif typefaces. Between 1947 and 1949 he established
  the \"house style\" for Penguin books in the UK: it was in the classical mold.\r\n\r\nTschichold
  himself tended to stress the gulf between his later classical typography and his
  earlier modernist style, which he came to condemn. In retrospect, however, the contrast
  is not perhaps as great as he made it. His later work is classical, but it is not
  fussy or artistic; it remains strongly marked by intense attention to detail, lack
  of fussiness and concentration on function.\r\n\r\nTshichold was primarily a user
  of type: a designer of books and printed matter. He did however design some typefaces,
  of which the best known is [[Sabon]], which continues to be much-admired as a text
  face.\r\n\r\nFor biographies see: Ruari McLean <cite>Jan Tschichold, typographer</cite>
