  to identify the font on this t-shirt. I've tried several methods of font identification
  and none can give me objective results. It appears to be similar to the OCR fonts,
  but it's not quite it.\r\n\r\nI'm not talking about the Sword Art Online logo.\r\n\r\nI'd
  be very helpful if someone could identify it for me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."
