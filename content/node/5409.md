body: I&#39;m struggling to find some well-designed &#40;Latin&#41; typefaces that
  have either an Asian flavor or are Asian-influenced. Specifically typefaces that
  would reflect the sophiscation and complexity of the Asian culture. My searches
  so far have yielded only a handful of &#34;take-out&#34; faces -- Sum Dum Goi, Chow
  Fun, Won Ton, Katana or AGFA Miyama, etc.; as well as techno-flavored T26&#39;s
  Fung Foo and CS Takahashi. None of these seem to reflect the elegance or intelligence
  that I&#39;m looking for. <BR> <BR>I vaguely remembered a study of Yakuza by Jared
  Benson here somewhere. Although I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s out for distribution
  yet.

    <BR> <BR>Neither is specifically Asian but both have an eastern brushwork sort
    of feeling.

  body: Orchidee is an excellent option. Present, Compliment, Calligraphic 421 and
    Koch Antiqua are great also. They have the sutle Asian feel without being too
    stereotypical. Kaneiwa Alp Regular is stylistically nice, however, it has some
    legibility issues. Thank you everyone for your help.
