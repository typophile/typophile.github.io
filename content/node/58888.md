body: "So I decided to finally try my hand at designing a typeface. I don't really
  know what I'm doing, but I've been reading and piecing together a technique based
  on what I see other people doing. My ultimate goal for this project is for it not
  to be awful. My initial plan was to design a multi-purpose sans serif typeface that
  is neutral enough to be used for virtually anything, but with enough personality
  to not be bland. \r\n\r\nI only have capital letters A-P drawn so far, but I would
  like to post what I have so I can correct any obvious blunders before I get too
  far into it. Be critical, but be nice!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_4505.jpg]"

  body: "Interesting. Its distinctiveness comes from its square proportions, I think.\r\n\r\nThe
    curves of your B are going to need more work, as the weight is pretty weak in
    places.\r\n\r\nThe G is giving me a strangely strong \"that's from Helvetica\"
    vibe, and I think it might be because a G without a spur would fit the style better."

  body: "Yes, the A, M, and O are all perfectly square \u2013 the remaining letters
    are varying degrees of rectangular.\r\n\r\nI can see that the B isn't quite right,
    but I'm not sure how to go about fixing it. Do you think it doesn't have enough
    weight where the bowls meet?\r\n\r\n<cite>The G is giving me a strangely strong
    \u201Cthat\u2019s from Helvetica\u201D vibe, and I think it might be because a
    G without a spur would fit the style better.</cite>\r\n\r\nGood eye. I used Helvetica's
    G as a visual reference. I didn't take any actual parts from it (stealing is bad),
    but styled mine after it. I think you're right though; it might jive better without
    the spur.\r\n"

  body: 'B: That, but more importantly, they don''t flow equally into the crossbar.
    You ought to be able to imagine removing either bowl and seeing that the other
    is continuous with the horizontal on the outside. (It won''t actually be so, but
    when the glyph is whole it should look that way.) The top almost is, but the bottom
    definitely is not.'

  body: The curves on the uppercase "D" look a little clunky, it feels as though the
    character has been stretched horizontally. I would bring it in a tad and reconsider
    the curvature. Good luck with your project.
