		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s just a usability issue; you don&rsquo;t have to follow my formula (which isn&rsquo;t even mine) for your fonts to work.</p>
<p>The reason to use an EM of 1000 is probably a legacy thing - maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter any more. But just in case it does, on some backwards app on somebody&rsquo;s old computer, you might as well use it, since it doesn&rsquo;t have any drawbacks (that I know of).</p>
<p>But the reason to use a nominal point size of 8 has something to it: it&rsquo;s what some users are most used to in pixelfonts (although calling it a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; might be pushing it), and you don&rsquo;t want people fishing for the size your font snaps at (without you putting the size in the font&rsquo;s name). Also, its 3/4 is a round number, which makes it work in &ldquo;native Windows&rdquo;*. And 12 might seem like a nicer nominal size to use, but it doesn&rsquo;t divide into 1000.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is however another problem with using a grayscale pixelfont in native Windows: the gamma gets thrown off (for some strange reason). Basically you need a separate (darker) version for that (which I provide for my stuff). The good news: Ultrafonts has this process automated; and the darker version is exactly what you need when you set the type light on a dark background!  :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then the 125x125 comes from 1000/8 of course.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have asked around a bunch about the 1000 UPM thing and have been given many excellent answers. To summarize what I have heard- while there is no hard &amp; fast rule everybody seems to agree that unless you have some overiding reason - like that you are making the font for microsoft and need to follow their UPM standard ( 2048 I think) - or you NEED more precision (maybe for a fab display face - in which case you might want 2000?)-  that you should just use 1000 UPM.</p>
<p>I guess the part that I still don&rsquo;t understand is since 75em usits seems to map to a pixel so well ( on a PC not a mac ) and double that is 150. Still, I suppose that the outline scales as it goes from 8 to 9 &amp; to 10 pt. I have been working to hit a 10pt target. So okay this is making some sense if 8pt=125em, 9=100em, &amp; 10=75 em then maybe 11= 50? 12 might be 25?</p>
<p>Or if not then - 1000 divided by 8 does equal 125, but 1000 divided by 10 = 100 ( which doesn&rsquo;t work as an idividual pixel on the PC ), and I think Zuzana Licko talked about using 84em for 12pt (really 83.333333333+   and so on but font programs don&rsquo;t allow that kind of coordinate number, just whole numbers ) but these all sound like Mac usable em numbers to me. Still, maybe 125 scales the 72/96 dpi issue better than the others.</p>
<p>The thing is fonts change size on screen ( but no in print ) when you go from mac to PC - I don&rsquo;t think pixel fonts are immune from this. So if you are looking for identical <em>screen</em> behavior you would need two fonts - or at least as far I can see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to try your number &amp; see what happens.</p>
<p>Still if you are making a tall/skinny font you would run out of vertical space with that 125 pretty fast!</p>

<p>Yes, it comes out to 10 points in native Windows. But why choose something that causes problems on a Mac, when you don&rsquo;t have to? And why deviate from the pseudo-standard of 8?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s better just to make users aware of the difference. That&rsquo;s a lot less hassle for everybody.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>My experience is that you&rsquo;re OK upto a span* of 16 pixels. Anything more and you really should use a larger nominal point size, probably 16. The thing is, above around 22 PPEM it&rsquo;s hard to justify pixelfonts anyway (since the OS renderers start doing a decent job).</p>
