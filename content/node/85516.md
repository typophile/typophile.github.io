body: "Hi there, I'm a new member to these forums as it's the first time I've needed
  to elicit the help of you guys, previously I was content to just peruse through
  the archives and find information there. So currently, I'm researching for my third
  year dissertation, and surprise surprise, it's on typography. \r\n\r\nOne of my
  case studies is based around typography acting as an identity for a city/region.
  There is already quite a bit that I've managed to gather on it, for example Metro
  Letters: a typeface for the twin cities - but all this is fairly recent. One of
  my themes of investigation is how type and cultural identity have changed over time.
  So my questions really are...\r\n\r\nIs it a recent phenomenon that cities feel
  like they have to have an almost corporate brand feel?\r\nIf so/if not, then when
  did it begin? \r\n\r\nN.B. I say \"history\", but even going back as far as the
  20th century is enough to compare. \r\n\r\nThanks very much in advance if anyone
  has any nuggets of information to part!"

    although \"trademarks\" have been around since at least 1777, when the Bass Brewery
    registered Great Britain's first \xAE, and longer than that in the form of the
    \"hallmarks\" used by craftsmen from medieval times.\r\n\r\nCity\u2014or, perhaps
    more properly, Empire\u2014\"branding\" is much older: in witness whereof, consider
    the iconic statue of Romulus and Remus and the SPQR banners carried by Roman legionaries."

  body: "Thanks oldnick for the pointers, I didn't think of looking at it from the
    \"empire\" point of view, it definitely sounds interesting, but may be straying
    a bit too much from my topics of discussion. So it's something to look in to at
    some other point I hope! Also I've since discovered it is claimed that Peter Behrens
    was the father/founder of corporate identity in 1907 for AEG. \r\n\r\nJamesM:
    There is quite a nice book which exhibits the whole process of the project. It's
    called Metro Letters: A typeface for the twin Cities. Basically back in 2003,
    in conjunction with the Twin Cities Design Celebration (TCDC), a type project
    was started inviting a handful of well established type designers/studios to create
    a unique face for the Twin Cities. The winning entry was by LettError, and I must
    admit it is a beaut, so do check it out. To this day, I don't think it has been
    implemented which is a shame, but there is mention in the book that it was mainly
    to brand any publications/literature derived for the TCDC and to get people interested
    in type and design, more so than to brand the two cities. Kind of like the stuff
    Erik Spiekermann did for Glasgow quite a few years ago, I guess."

  body: "Thanks for the additional info on Metro Letters. \r\n\r\nOffhand I'd think
    that cities have far less ability to brand themselves than private companies do.
    Branding a city's official website and literature is certainly feasible, although
    in many cities (especially smaller ones) some of the city's publications are put
    together by departmental staffers who clearly aren't designers and who may not
    understand or care about typographic guidelines.\r\n\r\nRegarding signage, city
    council members may be hesitant to vote the money to redo all the city's signage
    just to update the typography. And some signage may be impractical to change or
    may need to be retained for historic reasons.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying branding doesn't
    happen, obviously some cities do try to brand themselves. I'm just saying it's
    more difficult, for a variety of reasons, than for a corporation to do so."

    Although thanks for the mention and I now see that you were the one who started
    that discussion. Do you mind if I ask what your research was for and how did it
    go in the end? \r\n\r\nAs my question states I was more interested in finding
    out the how far back city's started this \"effort\", but through my research it
    does seem like something recently adapted in the past two decades maximum. However
    there has always been an intricate non-corportate relationship with city and typography
    obviously which is still very interesting. "

    of LettError's winning family. I did wonder whether since the project in 2003
    there have actually been any propositions to officially use it in the Twin Cities
    - I don't suppose you have any idea? There was no follow-up online which I found
    to suggest this. \r\n\r\nInterestingly Yanone's work for Amman, the capital of
    Jordan, although starting off in a sense as a university project, actually manifested
    into a typeface officially used by the city which is great news and with good
    coverage of the project as well."

  body: Using type to visually define a place may work best if you leverage design
    that is already associated in the public's subconscious mind with that place.
    The classic example is businesses who highlight their Maine roots by using Cheltenham,
    a face that is already synonymous with Maine because it's been used in the LL
    Bean catalog for decades.

  body: Hi this is my first post, but I personally have dealt with ideas in relation
    to this. I am a geography student here in Utah (Western U.S., Rockies, Great Salt
    Lake, etc.) and completed a paper awhile ago on my town's "Sense of Place". In
    reference to that I would like you Google "Welcome Arches", the Western U.S. is
    dotted with them. Most famous might be Reno, Nevada. My hometown (Brigham City,
    Utah) has quite a good looking one as well which has been there since the mid
    1920's. Also something that might help...Google or Wikipedia "Hillside Letters"
    or "Mountain Monograms" these are letters that represent High Schools and Colleges.
    I find one in most every town with a decent hill or mountain nearby, including
    my own. I don't know if this is in the direction you are heading, but here's a
    nickel in your hat.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4230595_4229.jpg]

  body: "Ah right, yes now you've brought it to my attention, I do remember that Las
    Vegas sign featured in films and whatnot, it didn't cross my mind to think of
    that when looking at welcome \"arches\", but I agree it pretty much does the same
    job. \r\n\r\nWasn't there some celebrity uproar when there were talks of disposing
    of the sign? I remember reading that actors were paying ridiculous amounts trying
    to save it. Anyway, it's interesting that you bring it up actually, obviously
    the Hollywood sign is one of its kind and instantly recognisable, but I wonder
    whether it's the whole backdrop and context as well that contribute to that. For
    example, if you were to replace the lettering, particular the \"O\"s with a rounder
    form for instance, do you think people would notice? \r\n\r\nQuestions like this
    are surfacing in my mind since I'm also looking at the London Underground and
    Johnston's infamous typeface, and I found out a while ago that one of the roundels
    at Euston Square (just an underground station for people unfamiliar with the tube)
    actually have the wrong typeface, I believe they used Gill Sans instead of Johnston's,
    yet I don't think people bat an eyelid when they look at it. May have something
    to do with the two faces being quite similar, or also just because it's not a
    big deal. "

  body: 'Hi, I don''t know what parameters you have, but the idea of associating visual
    symbols to places can be quite far reaching. Have you considered the concept of
    landmarks in relationship to communicating place. Using made up symbols to communicate
    might be a nice  venture, consider the hobos who placed notches on fence posts
    to communicate a friendly home. [[http://www.vagabondish.com/the-secret-language-of-vagabonds-and-traveling-hobos/]]
    The prominence of structures also can create significance thus creating a sense
    of language without the use of the alphabet. I apologize if I keep finding examples
    from my region but not only was Independence Rock in Wyoming a landmark of significance
    to the pioneers, but they carved and tarred their names in it! I have been there
    and it is quite a sight! This might be a little in left field (I tend to be a
    divergent thinker) How about "Metes and Bounds" which communicates property lines
    using natural features. All I''m saying is don''t limit yourself to the alphabet,
    visual communication is everywhere! If I saw a picture of Big Ben I wouldn''t
    think, A big clock. I would think, Big Ben=London. You can''t force that type
    of communication. Typography is interesting because it''s one of the few arts
    that tries NOT to be noticed...well, generally. Question? Do you have an actual
    hypothesis in mind for this dissertation, or is this an exploration. (I should
    have started with that question to begin with.) Thanks for your consideration. '

  body: 'Thanks, TurtleType, I love diverse thinking myself as usually better ideas
    follow but I''m afraid my time is limited in this venture and I just need to press
    on with what I already have and not diverge too much. Obviously there is communication
    on all levels and it''s not limited to type and letterforms, but that is my main
    area of interest and if I branch out too much I might as well be looking at visual
    communication as a whole. Also just to establish that it''s an explorative study
    I''m doing rather than proposing a hypothesise and then looking for findings etc.
    Basically I am focused on the relationship between typography and culture, and
    investigating this on three levels: national, local/regional and in metro systems
    with time as a parameter, so my research spans from the last century. This was
    actually through the suggestion of my supporting tutor, however I''ve come to
    regret it as with such a wide scope it doesn''t seem feasible to get really in-depth.
    I would have definitely done it differently had I not already gone this far. '
