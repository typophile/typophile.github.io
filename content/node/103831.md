body: "Hello friends!\r\nI'm writing because I feel I'm lost with my project.\r\nI
  need your eyes here, because I'm tired of trying things and it seems this font has
  no solution.\r\n\r\nI want to make \"the boldest\" didone out there, so I started
  experimenting and this was my result.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/help_boldest_5629.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is that some letters (ie the \"e\" or the \"v\" etc) don't work in small
  sizes.\r\nIn the lowest part of the image I wrote \"Mexico and Pistilli\" So you
  can see what I mean. \r\nPistilli turns really black (and that's what I want) but
  Mexico has so many white space between letters that it drives me crazy.\r\n\r\nIs
  there something you suggest?\r\nI tried making the stems of those \"open\" letters
  bolder, but it seems it's not the solution.\r\n\r\nAny referent?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMax"

    It would be like curing the king's headache by chopping off his head.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks hrant;\r\nYes, it's not easy to see a solution here. I also can't
    find too many referents, no more than one ore two, which actually are not this
    black.\r\nEven in Bodoni Poster (Adobe)\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bodoni-poster/\r\nIf
    you write Pistilli - Mexico, there's difference of weight between the words...
    Am I too crazy?"

  body: "Tough problem indeed. I do think that in the case of the word \u201Cbeautiful\u201D,
    the \u201Ca\u201D in the lower example works much better than the upper. \r\nWith
    \u201Cpistilli\u201D, in a didone typeface I'm working on I increased the spacing
    between the letter pairs ll, lh, and lb by kerning them. I think that could be
    done here slightly, to keep a more even texture if you want."

    I've got this question.\r\nWhich of these CAPS do you think that work better?\r\ntaller
    medium shorter?\r\n"

  body: Not certain that one stands out, though I prefer the taller caps. They seem
    more impactful at these display sizes.
