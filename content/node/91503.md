  body: "I could be wrong but I think old film titles does not necessarily correspond
    to a specific font -they were usually custom lettering- and even if there was
    a font used, it's highly probable that this font is not converted to a digital
    era font.\r\n\r\nRegarding the lowercase letters of \"Sviluppo e stampa - Tecnico\"\r\nyou
    can take a similar look and feel with <strong>[[http://www.houseind.com/t/a5948c|Neutra
    Display Bold]]</strong>\r\n\r\nFor an approximation of the capitals \"ISTITUTO
    NAZIONALE LUCE etc.\" \r\nyou could combine <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/|Interstate
    Black]]</strong> \r\nwith the /S and /C of <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/|Helvetica
    Black]]</strong>\r\n"
