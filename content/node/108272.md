    , albeit upside down. Unfortunately, it does not contain an X or Y.\r\n\r\nIt
    has no internal copyright and I didn't find it on any reputable download site
    - so I'm not linking to it."

  body: "Hi Mike, the Firenze initials that I found -- presumably the same as your
    copy -- consist of auto-traced images, with little if any editing and the date
    1998. The auto-tracing is fairly accurate, as these things go, but I suspect that
    this is the work of an amateur font enthusiast. As to what it can be used for,
    this is a very grey legal area. Neither a copyright claim nor an open font license.\r\nDon "
