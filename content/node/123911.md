    [see third paragraph]\r\n\r\nWithout a larger, clearer sample, it will be difficult
    to ID."

  body: Neither version of Palatino that you referenced has the angled serif you see
    at the top of the capital |F| in the sample....

  body: "Per Jan's suggestion here are the Nike lower case letters in Palatino BQ
    extended 120% vertical [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PalatinoBQ@V120pctAshelight@48pct_5806.jpg]\r\nNike
    image is fuzzy, but from what I can see this is pretty close. Most noticeable
    difference is the diagonal stroke on _s_, as already mentioned by Jan.\r\nI leave
    it to someone else to check the Nike upper case letters against the Linotype UC
    extended 120% vertical.\r\nDon"
