  please note, we will be sticking with Sugar Bakery & Cafe as the brand (not switching

    showing 30+ concepts/variations and asking for opinions gives me the feeling that
    you're really shooting in the dark.  \r\n\r\nYou really should consider getting
    a professional graphic designer to help you out. Perhaps one of your customers
    is a designer, or some fellow business owners could suggest someone. It's money
    well spent. And perhaps they'd even be willing to do some of the work in trade.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Number 1 or 2 for me, but I agree with what others said about you needing
    to rein things in a bit. Try actually sketching out ideas on paper (if you haven't
    already) before looking at typefaces. Get a feeling in your head of how you want
    it to look first before actually looking. \r\n\r\nIt appears that you're suffering
    from typeface paralysis\u2014you have a ton to choose from and the more you wander
    through your type library the less and less certain you are about your choices.

  body: "It would help to see it bigger, but my first impression is that the 2 lines
    are fighting for dominance, with the 1st line (sugar) being larger, but the 2nd
    line being bolder.  If the words are not identical in importance, then you want
    to have a clear hierarchy of importance. So if you want \"sugar\" to be the focal
    point of the logo, I would tone down \"bakery & cafe\", perhaps by making it less
    bold.\r\n\r\nAlso the letterspacing needs work. For example, compare the narrow
    space between SU with the wide space between GA.\r\n\r\nThe vivid pink stripes
    in the background seem overpowering.  I know you use them as a background on your
    website, so perhaps they aren't part of the logo itself, but either way you might
    want to experiment making them more pastel."

  body: "I like it. I agree with JamesM that you need to make BAKERY & CAFE thinner
    so it doesn't outcompete Sugar. Also, try looking at the logo without the striped
    background - you won't always be able to use it with the background (unless you
    can afford fancy full-color-printed paper bags, cups, stickers, etc., and only
    advertise in full-color publications).\r\n\r\nAlso, the dotted outline collides
    with the solid outline in a few places. Try printing the logo very small and see
    how those dots look. You might need to make the dots bigger/farther apart/farther
    from the solid line. Are you doing this in Illustrator? At some point you'll have
    to convert everything to outlines, so if your borders are single vector lines
    with a thickness and/or dotted pattern applied, you'll need to settle on a relative
    dot spacing/line width that will work at all sizes. (I didn't explain that very
    well).\r\n\r\nIf/when you do place the logo over the stripes, it might look nicer
    if the edges of the logo don't collide with the edges of the stripes (i.e., make
    the edges of the logo fall in the middle of a stripe).\r\n"

    for dominance, and decided that actually, I want bakery & cafe to be the dominant
    \"take away\". Maybe that's wrong? Comments?\r\n\r\nThe logo will be on our stickers,
    our business card, and web site which are full color so they will appear with
    the pink stripes. I will certainly tweak the size/scale of the stripes to minimize
    the awkward positioning. the \"bone\" color will simply be toothy natural stock,
    and so because we're using that paper, the stripes will also hopefully look a
    bit more rustic or distressed. "

  body: The name is Sugar, no? Bakery & Cafe are generic terms that describe what
    they do. So Sugar should be the dominant part. Never ever let your ego come before
    the client's needs, just because you happen to like a certain font or something
    like that. At that point you're no longer a designer.

    If you haven't tried this already, print some actual-size mockups and ask a few
    folks if the small type is legible. If any of your customers are middle aged or
    older, include those age groups in the test. \r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that there

    is a web address / phone number necessary? If after deep thought on that question,
    your answer is yes, have you thought about just putting the web address and phone
    number on the sticker alone? (sans logo?) Just floating some ideas out there."
