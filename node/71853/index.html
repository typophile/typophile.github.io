With changes at work I need a bit of advice.</p>
<p>We have developed a new product and as such have/are going to receive an equity investment. As part of the deal we need to set up a LTD company. Currently my  business partner and myself are a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). Moving to the LTD Company we need to transfer our business assets across into the LLP, part of these for myself would be my type collection.</p>
<p>I have no problem finding out the value of my hardware but I can&rsquo;t seem to find any value for my fonts? 
How do you value fonts in a situation like this?</p>
<p>I currently have the Adobe type collection (around 7 years old) and approx  £1000 (at purchase price) of additional fonts.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Martin</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the thoughts
as for the transfers of license, there is no transfer as it is effectively just a change of name (more of a accountancy exercise). 
does not accurately represent the true value of an item, especially with Apple hardware, 
i.e According to my accountant my MAC Pro should be worth 1/3 its value now (based on depreciation over 3 years), however Ebay and secondhand site suggest it has only lost £300 of value?  Most confusing especially when my 3 year old G5 recently sold for £800 This leads to a problem calculating how much my font collection is worth&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it would be hard to quantify as you only own the licences for the fonts, not the actual fonts thselves.&rdquo;
This is true but since I am still the licensee I simply need to know how much these are worth to the new company (tax reasons), are fonts worthless once bought? or do they change value? For instance my upgrade to CS4 has been valued by our accountant at £800  even though it is only valid on my one desktop?</p>
<p>most confusing

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think hardware or usual software depreciation are suitable here. Their depreciation rates are very high due to quick obsolescence.</p>
<p>But a font license would be used without any kind of obsolescence for many years. Just after a long renew in general technology one finds a font really deprecated –and even in this case, this may be surprisingly slow.</p>
<p>Take the Type1 transition to OpenType: after a decade, OT is still under adoption and T1 is still perfectly usable.</p>
<p>This, of course, is from the technological point of view. In terms of design, culture and marketing, a new font is more valuable than a massively used one. But even in this case, the velocity is slower than you may find in other design areas. Trends in car, web or clothing design become &lsquo;old&rsquo; after two or three years (in some case, even earlier). A font surely not.</p>
<p>An annual 7% depreciation seems to be a logical rate (so you&rsquo;re estimating the font has about 14 years of usage). In accounting practice, for example, hardware/software are depreciated at a 20–30% annual rate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Depreciation rules vary from country to country. For instance here in Canada the &ldquo;Captial Cost Allowance&rdquo; for software was recently changed so the full value of software could be depreciated in one year rather than over 3. However assigning a value for legal purposes may be different from those used for tax calculations. You need to consult an accountant. Usually you&rsquo;d use &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; (what you&rsquo;d expect to sell it for on eBay, for instance) or &ldquo;book value&rdquo; (the asset value you have identified in your accounts).</div>
