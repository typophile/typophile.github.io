  body: "Suggestions: \r\n\r\nDrop the Personal Statement. Unless it's truly unique
    and highly specific, it's pretty much pointless. \r\n\r\nExpand upon both your
    Experience and Education. You have the room. Elaborate a bit more on details,
    highlights, etc.\r\n\r\nHTML and CSS are acronyms (should be all caps)\r\n\r\nJavaScript
    (note spelling). Also, drop 'very' or drop the whole line. \r\n\r\nMinor pet peeve...switch
    from the hotmail address to a gmail one."

  body: "You don't need to say \"Contact Information\" and keep your website with
    your other contact info.\r\n\r\nThe ital you are using looks smaller and somewhat
    condensed compared to the roman and thus of less importance. Perhaps switching
    your job and schools to be roman and the following info in the ital. Or try setting
    the italic a little larger.\r\n\r\nOverall it looks unbalanced with a narrow margin
    on the left and a very wide margin on the right. \r\n\r\nAs Aluminum said HTML
    and CSS should be ALL CAPS not large and small caps.\r\n\r\nDelete the duration
    of your internship and \"Hope to hear from you soon\" the later can be the sign
    off of your cover letter but it's not appropriate on a resume.\r\n\r\nIf you want
    to keep your name centered with the rest of the copy flush left there should be
    more space between the two. It's not a rule but often you will see resumes have
    the name and contact info centered and then the body of the resume is set flush
    left.\r\n\r\nThere should be more info about your job and colleges; where they
    are and the year you worked/graduated. List the few design classes you too at
    SDSU rather than say \"took several design classes, but mostly arts and crafts\".\r\n\r\nYour
    interests don't tell us anything new. Either delete entirely or list your specific
    arts and crafts here."

  body: "I suggest dropping the Interests section. Also, I think the headings need
    a little more to set them off from the content; centered headings works, or you
    could place the headings to the left and the content to the right.\r\n\r\nEducation
    typically refers only to degrees that you have earned; if you want to discuss
    specific classes, I think a Coursework section would be more appropriate. \r\n\r\nI
    would avoid sub-headings such as \"Experience,\" \"Duration,\" and \"Responsibilities.\"
    Instead, simply state what you did: \"Designed fliers for several Latino Film
    Festival events, as well as banners for the company's website, mediaartscenter.org.\"
    Always use \"strong action words\" in the past tense. Also, I'm fairly certain
    URLs technically should be italicized.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'd advise dropping the
    \"Duration\" sub-heading, how long you've done things should be included, in the
    form of start and end dates. Include the month and the year: \"August 2005 to
    May 2007.\" This applies to any jobs, internships, education, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's
    good that you dropped the Personal Statement section; however, a similar Objective
    section may be in order. Remember that you should never submit a generic r\xE9sum\xE9!
    Each one should be custom-tailored for the specific job you want. In which case,
    stating a description of said job is easy, eg \"An entry-level document design
    position,\" \"An entry-level web design and development position,\" or something
    along those lines. If you're just writing a generic r\xE9sum\xE9, then omit the
    Objective section.\r\n\r\nWhen you write your cover letter, be sure to refer to
    the r\xE9sum\xE9 (eg \"As stated on the enclosed r\xE9sum\xE9...\"). As Kris10
    points out, the \"I hope to hear from you soon!\" would be a good conclusion for
    your cover letter, but I'd advise staying away from words like \"hope,\" \"want,\"
    \"if,\" etc, as these do not convey confidence. Its a good idea to give them your
    contact info to close the cover letter, and close confidently: \"I can be contacted
    by phone at 619-757-7310 or by email at etahchen@hotmail.com. I look forward to
    meeting you soon.\"\r\n\r\n Be sure to print both on r\xE9sum\xE9 paper as well\u2014the
    person reading this will be very busy, and likely has a bunch of other applicants
    to go through. Its likely that they will look at your r\xE9sum\xE9 for 3 to 5
    seconds, so you have to make an excellent impression!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with all of
    my posts, take it with a grain of salt, but those are my suggestions.... and sorry
    to be so lengthy; I'm just a bit of a stickler when it comes to r\xE9sum\xE9s.
    Good luck!\r\n"

  body: "Eh, I think you're giving too much information.\r\n\r\nUnder work experience,
    nobody cares that you only worked 2 months because school etc. Just put the months
    you worked. When was it? It should read:\r\n\r\nWork Experience\r\n\r\nMedia Arts

  body: "Looking much better! If you could include dates for your time at Southwestern
    and SDSU, that would be good. Also, for the schools, you don't need the whole
    address. Just the city and state will be fine. For dates, the exact day isn't
    necessary; just put the month and year.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to make it longer,
    you could include a Coursework section, describing specific courses you've taken
    that are relevant for the job you are applying for. Write it in the same way you
    write the work experience section.\r\n\r\nIn the previous version, you had a lot
    of writing under each section. As Steven said, that is too much information\u2014for
    a r\xE9sum\xE9. Don't trash those thoughts altogether, because they may well be
    appropriate for your cover letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note, please make sure
    that the entries under each heading are sequenced <em>from most recent to most
    long ago.</em> It's a bit of a pesky detail, but I'd advise paying attention to
    it."

  body: Just a thought, I recently did a resume for my current job and I did something
    that included graphics that went over pretty well. If you are planning to hand
    this to creative-types, it could go over well. I would say to line break at "Festival
    events and ... etc" and use that half of your resume for an image that really
    showcases your work. Simple, clear, precise work. Maybe even an image similar
    to your website header, but black and white. Just some thoughts!
