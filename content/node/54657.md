  | Myfonts.com]].  I regard Sabio as an evolutionary face. By this I mean that it
  merges elements of script and Roman design into one elegant whole.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sabio_Poster_4214.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  design was \u2018evolved\u2019 somewhere between these two classic approaches. The
  resulting family of faces makes an excellent display family, but is also clear and
  legible at small sizes and can be used as a text face with a distinctive flair.
  More\u2026\r\n\r\nSabio is a wonderfully flexible face that can sit happily alongside
  artwork that owes its inspiration to any era from the Art Deco onwards. The regular
  form is gently and subtly oblique, and the glyphs have a slight hint of swash about
  them. Alternate and perpendicular forms are also offered. The regular, alternate
  and perpendicular forms are all in turn offered in regular, and bold weights as
  well as in a condensed form.\r\n\r\nMore samples of Sabio in action can be found
  on Greater Albion's [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n"
