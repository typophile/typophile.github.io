  even what it's called.\r\n\r\nI remember it being a Java program where you set the
  values of certain parameters (pressure, ductus, complexity, etc.) and it generates
  a font full of glyphs that look kinda like strokes made by hand.\r\n\r\nIt was like
  a handwriting font generator, without actually using real letters.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know what I mean?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Amy"

    except I looked twice and couldn't find it. I know it was a thread on Typophile
    with virtually (or maybe literally) zero replies. Is there a way to do a Search
    for that?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    been great if it created a real alphabet, instead of jibberish.  =)"
