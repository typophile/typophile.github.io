    and 600 are free if you want something bolder.\r\n\r\nIf not try Archer at www.typography.com\r\n\r\nGed\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Stymie Light is close (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/stymie/ef-light/),
    as is Lubalin Graph (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-lubalin-graph/) --
    though I don't know if there's an extralight version.

  body: wow I am intrigued by this one it is like a combination of Lubalin Graph vs
    Museo... I quite like it

  body: "The old Image Club version of [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_s/stymie_hairline_full.gif|ITC
    Stymie Hairline]] is almost exactly like this. The M seems to be the only letter
    I can see that is different, and the serifs seem removed from the one used in
    'Meta'. (The sample shown is from the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]])\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Hi the lowercase 'l' is way different hence the cross between Museo and Lubalin
    or Stymie... the 'l' is what really has me searching, though I would maybe think
    a customised typeface?.. or a commissioned?
