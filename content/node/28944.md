  school i started studying. i already ordered some books and magazines (reproduction
  of frutigers woodcuts, for example) but am mainly looking for samples of early grotesques.
  with early i mean everything from royal grotesk (if there is any sample of that
  in any book) over scheltersche grotesk to akzidenz grotesk, including american grotesques
  like franklin gothic.\r\n\r\ni can also get typographische monatsbl\xE4tter and
  similar magazines, but only in yearbooks, so i'd need to know year and month if
  you know any interesting editions of those.\r\n\r\nunfortunately they dont have
  too many type specimens, so im trying to find books to find samples. im working
  on my own grotesque design (fun only) in which i mix \"the european and american
  models\" a little bit (inclundg a two story g for example). plus you all got me
  infected with typophilis ;)\r\n\r\nif im already at it, another question: does anybody
  here know what \"Sp\xE9cimen g\xE9n\xE9ral tome\" is? they have four books of it,
  nr. 2 being sansserif and slabserif designs, i'll get that one anyway but maybe
  you know if they're interesting enough to also get the three other volumes.\r\n\r\nsorry
  for the lengthy post.. i hope someone will answer!"

    You can read a lot on the subject, and find great samples, in the Akzidenz-Grotesk

  body: "i know both threads, but forgot about searching them for book references,
    thanks. i found a 2-volume Deberny & Peignot specimen book from 1922. i made copies
    of the interesting faces, but i dont have a scanner. if im able to get a scanner
    from my school i'll put them on typophile.\r\n\r\ni found an extra-bold weight
    of VAG rounded (a specimen book by niggli in 1990, but i have never seen it in
    digital form). some reprints of original jenson-type, and maaaany strange grotesques.
    im happyyyyy ;)"
