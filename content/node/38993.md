  the brush of Angel Koziupa and the technical expertise of Ale Paul go face to face
  with the art deco aesthetic, you end up with a beautiful face like <strong><a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000299\">Bellas
  Artes</a></strong>. The sensual curves provided by Koziupa become players in a game
  of equals, where there is no such thing as the better half. Both sides of the characters
  complement each other like lovers in a perfect romance.\r\n\r\nBellas Artes is an
  excellent choice for packaging design, book covers, and music-related artwork aimed
  at the feminine demographic and classical tastes.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com\">Sudtipos</a></strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I figured as much, but each of your scripts is so complete and well-drawn
    that it's hard to grasp how you maintain such a high output. One script each year
    from you would still be awe-inspiring. :-)
