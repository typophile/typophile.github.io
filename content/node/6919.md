  body: '&#62;If the pleasure is mutual, and not selfish and objectifying, it is not
    lust. <BR> <BR>You are defining lust in a way that is &#39;politically correct&#39;
    now, but I challenge you to find in any traditional Christian source, including
    St. Thomas, your view that if pleasure is mutual it is not lust. Here is the Catholic
    Encyclopedia definition of Lust: <BR> <BR>&#34;The inordinate craving for, or
    indulgence of, the carnal pleasure which is experienced in the human organs of
    generation.&#34; <BR> <BR>It is the strength of desire that is objected to, not
    whether it is mutual. The plain reading of my earlier quoted passage of St. Thomas
    is that he objects to having sex with one&#39;s wife for the sake of satisfying
    powerful sexual desire, rather than procreation or other noble purpose not related
    to your own pleasure. Pursuit of carnal pleasure is in no way seen as legitimate
    in itself.    <BR> <BR>&#62;forms of contraception are permitted in family planning
    <BR> <BR>The traditional approach was to permit birth control fairly liberally
    on behalf of the woman&#39;s heath and the welfare of her children, while prohibiting
    it on the part of the man. This was part because of the biblical passage about
    Onan, but also because of, as you note, the mitzvah to be fruitful and multiply
    - and I suspect the belief that men had a limited supply of sperm. I think this
    belief, which is false for men and instead true for women&#39;s eggs, was based
    on Galen&#39;s mistaken theories of procreation. <BR> <BR>Only the Orthodox &#40;10-15%
    of Jews&#41; are guided by the traditional analysis, and I don&#39;t honestly
    know what the current application of the tradition is, especially as the Orthodox
    sometimes differ radically among themselves. The Orthodox are definitely more
    influenced by the &#39;pru urvu&#39; &#40;be fruitful and multiply&#41; commandment,
    and many have large families.'

    <BR> <BR>That is the point I have made several times: reducing sex to carnal pleasure
    is illegitimate. I&#39;m not sure what you think I&#39;m disagreeing with in this
    traditional teaching. I don&#39;t think the fact that you really, really want
    to get it on is actually a good enough reason for sex. My own view of sex is that
    one should always be seeking to maximise it; that is, to put as much in and get
    as much out of the experience as possible. Quite simply, I&#39;ve found this leads
    to better sex. This means emotional and spiritual investment, vulnerability, openness
    and generosity, not just satisfying powerful sexual desire. <BR> <BR>I have to

    or scotch to taste good the first time they tried it? It seems to me that these
    are acquired tastes, and the primary reason they are acquired is because of the
    effects of the alcohol in them.</i> <BR> <BR>But lots of the things we eat and
    drink are acquired tastes, especially to immature or inexperience palates. There
    are lots of things that people eat that are not immediately delicious to most
    people, but many of them are ingredients in the world&#39;s great cuisines, without
    the need for any psycho-chemical effect to encourage people to consume them. People
    try them and develop a taste for them because they&#39;ve learned -- if they&#39;re
    fortunate to have been raised on something other than junk food -- that a varied
    and sophisticated diet is a good thing and that many &#39;difficult&#39; tastes
    are worth acquiring. I write this with a glass of Ardbeg beside me: the most complex
    and atypical scotch I&#39;ve ever drunk. It has taken me the better part of a
    year to make my way toward the end of the bottle, and I&#39;m just beginning to
    really appreciate it. Obviously, at that rate, I&#39;m not getting even a little
    bit drunk. But I&#39;m having a great time! Cheers.'

    or less&#41; which clients would you be willing to quit your job over so as not
    to have to do work for them? This is a more serious question, I think. The truth
    is, for me, I do work that I don&#39;t want to show others all of the time because
    I think it doesn&#39;t show my true potential. On some level, the proud/arrogant
    designer level perhaps, I feel pimped doing some of it. But, I don&#39;t quit
    my job because of it. Would you, all who are reading and have posted, quit your

    perspectives there. <BR> <BR>An excerpt from my post which I think is relevant
    here: &#34;The point is that Design is complicit in the expression of sex and
    sexuality in our world, particularly in the mainstream and in popular culture.
    So how do we address our own roles? I doubt that most of us will ever lay out
    a porn spread, but how many of us have worked on or will work on a women&#39;s
    magazine, or a perfume ad, or a movie poster, or a beer commercial... ? How do
    we address sexuality in our work, which is often the vehicle for expressing/communicating
    these ideas? Is it appropriate to voice your dissent in the face of a client or
    employer about sexuality as a marketing device, or should we back off and do the
    job? Is sexuality a legitimate marketing tool because it is part of everyone on
    Earth? Or is it something we should avoid because we are sexualizing material
    objects and manipulating our fellow humans&#39; most basic motivators for profit?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think anyone here would work on child porn. It&#39;s the
    grey areas that are the most interesting to/challenging for me.'

    I don&#39;t put animal welfare right at the top of my list, but as a vegetarian
    for twenty-something years, its not something I&#39;m unaware of either. With
    the whale situation there&#39;s also the problem of &#39;over-fishing&#39; &#40;or
    is it over-mamalling&#41; which upsets the delicate balance of the oceanic eco-system,
    and could have dramatically undesirable effects. <BR> <BR>Well, &#39;what do we
    do about it?&#39;, you ask. <BR> <BR>Well, you could campaign against it. You
    stated that many Americans don&#39;t know about it &#40;I don&#39;t think many
    people in England do either, but I couldn&#39;t speak for the other countries
    you name&#41;. <BR>Perhaps if more people knew about it they would join you in
    the campaign. <BR>If you get enough people to be outraged at the situation,then
    you might only need that number of people to boycott the companies involved in
    order to have an impact. <BR>&#40;Of course, it might be difficult to convince
    people that eat cows and pigs and lambs that eating horses is worth objecting
    to. I don&#39;t know, you would have to ask them&#41;. <BR> <BR>If people boycott
    a company, its probably ten times more effective if they write to the company
    and tell them why they are doing so. It doesn&#39;t have to be the &#39;producer&#39;
    or slaughterhouse or whatever, it could be any company involved in the trade.
    <BR> <BR>You might not have any impact with this approach, although it would be
    difficult to run a campaign like that and not, at least, make a few people think
    about things a bit more. <BR>You might have some impact. There are many instances
    of improvements over the years due to consumer pressure.

    <BR> <BR>&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;leading to the destruction of love&#34; <BR>---I
    hope it has not to do with television, &#39;cause it sounds <BR>like a romantic
    sentence. Also, lies &amp; deceitful indulgences <BR>goes against delighting in
    tenderness, love &amp; work. <BR>If you try to make your work a prayer, it makes
    you happy. <BR> <BR>&#34;P.S. Not all porn is created equal.&#34; <BR>---I find
    salient that the only time Jesus wrote something <BR>it was in the sand, when
    a prostitute was accused [Gospel]. <BR> <BR>&#34;In fact, that brilliant yet extremely
    repressed man <BR>spent his entire life avoiding pleasure.&#34; <BR>---Did you
    read &#39;The Magistro&#39;? <BR> <BR>&#34;make it less important to their happiness,
    <BR>and the religion more important.&#34; <BR>---Yes, I still don&#39;t know who
    is people, but they can be <BR>very funny, wasting energies in display rituals.
    <BR>To pray is a 8 pt matter to me. <BR> <BR>&#34;If it feels so good, why am
    I so sad?&#34; <BR>---Maybe it is the misconception of the time. <BR>I observed
    that a &#39;moment&#39; is a part of the process <BR>of the time, like a frozen
    word. However we have <BR>an heart which is located somewhere, in this world.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;encourage tenderness between them and favour the education
    <BR>of an authentic freedom;&#34; &#34;emotional and spiritual investment,  <BR>vulnerability,
    openness and generosity, not just satisfying <BR>powerful sexual desire.&#34;
    <BR>---Very nice. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fun! Bible versus and porn! Woohoo!&#34; &amp;
    &#34;the thread could <BR>easily be changed to &#34;what wouldn&#39;t you watch
    on tv.&#34; <BR>---That is rather very interesting to me. I think of &#39;porno&#39;
    <BR>as an intimate place, not as an image on a screen. If there is <BR>something
    funny maybe that is because those things get swapped <BR>within the money &amp;
    laundries. <BR> <BR>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t work for Santa Claus.&#34; <BR>---LOL
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Is sexuality a legitimate marketing tool because it is part <BR>of
    everyone on Earth?&#34; <BR>---I see sexuality as a good joker in the marketing
    &#39;game,&#39; <BR>just its visualizations stink when &#39;designed&#39; by ideas-anaemic
    <BR>persons. <BR> <BR>&#34;last night i dreamt that an imaginary boss made me
    use drop <BR>shadows so i quit.&#34; <BR>---LOL <BR> <BR>&#34;He chose the wrong
    religion.&#34; <BR>---I gave up on my idea of rasta dreadlocks on 1994, although
    <BR>I am quite curly. By that time I read the biography of Malcolm X, <BR>which
    was also the first book I read in my life. <BR> <BR>&#34;yes, vienna is dreamland,
    at least where i am, because there <BR>is still the possibilty to dream... and
    if you cared, you&#39;d see <BR>some dreams come true.&#34; <BR>---Thank you,
    I needed to read your words. <BR> <BR>&#34;Look at yourself as a conduit. You
    control the flow.&#34; <BR>---Cool. Only the love and the death change all the
    things. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nothing generates interest like sex&#34; <BR>---But sex
