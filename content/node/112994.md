  body: I think you should carry the equally weighted balance of X, x, n, u, m, w
    through to A, U, W, Y, y, where there's no longer much sense in the thin sides.
    Definitely the A if not the others. This may leave the distinctive v (and presumably
    V) in a category by itself but I think it's strong enough for that.
