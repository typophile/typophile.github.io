  expert but Caslon came to mind but then I noticed the other characteristics, so
  I'm curious as to what this could be?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions/answers will be highly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to my example:\r\nhttp://i26.tinypic.com/oshimg.jpg\r\n\r\n(I
  tried attaching the picture but the connection seemed to time out for some reason,
  didn't before).\r\n\r\n- Alyssa"

  body: I was going to say it's <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/didoni/>Didoni</a>,
    but Didoni's serifs are bracketed unlike your sample's. It's pretty close, though.

    Didi</a>. The closest digital font available for retail is probably <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/paratype/didona_book_ot/?sample_text=Goya&sample_size=144">Didona</a>.
