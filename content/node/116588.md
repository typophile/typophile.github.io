  body: "I would love to see more lettering in this style -- a very evocative expression
    of Germany in 1931 -- heavy, crisp and jarring letters that somehow still have
    a disciplined structure,  that look like they were written with bamboo or a broad
    pen nib.  Would make a superb font.\r\nA few substitutes:\r\nMatura http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/matura-mt/
    Designed by Imre Reiner in 1938. \r\nMercurius  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/mercurius/
    Designed by Imre Reiner in 1957  \r\nLotto http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/lotto/\r\nDesigned
    by H. Thannhaeuser in 1955 \r\nTime Script Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/time-script-lt/
    Designed by G. Trump 1956. \r\nGneisenauette Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gneisenauette/
    Designed by G.A. Grinbergs in 1977.\r\nKompakt http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kompakt/
    Designed by H. Zapf in 1954.\r\nFox http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/fox/ Designed
    by W. Rebhuhn in 1955.\r\nI would also include India Ink CP, already mentioned
    by Dick Pape.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks for the replies!\r\n\r\nDon, I agree completely about this style,
    and if no one else designs something based on it I will myself. It occurs to me
    that although not as cute, this has similarities to some of Lucien Bernhard's
    scripts, and their derivatives, such as: \r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/bernhard-brushscript-sg/]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/didgeree-doodle-nf/]]\r\n\r\nAny
    other leads would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nTaylor\r\n"
