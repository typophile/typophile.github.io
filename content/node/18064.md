  below is no later than 1971 or 1972.  The type looks very much like Univers 65 Bold,
  yet it is a bit more condensed, but not to the extreme of Univers Condensed.  It
  has a more rounded condensation. (I'm looking at the S and G).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/underground3.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnybody
  have ideas as to what this can be?"

  body: It's not that condensed, and all of the letters are somewhat rounded, which
    leads me to believe that it's an overexposed phototype Univers or one of its clones,
    maybe with some optical condensation  / vertical stretching applied.
