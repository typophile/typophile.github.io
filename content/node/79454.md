  \r\nWhat specific uses do you know besides for logos. I know things such as the
  nutritional facts,MTA signs and the USPS signs. "

  body: "Thank  you for trying to help. The other thread talks about  the history
    of helvetica and it compared to other fonts. The wikipidia link I have seen and
    it gives great examples of logos and a couple other uses which I have already
    mentioned. \r\n\r\nI have seen the Helvetica movie twice and will try to watch
    it again now to see the examples they show. \r\n\r\nI want non-logo uses of helvetica. "

    book spines, on the signs in the subway (here in Stockholm), it's guaranteed to
    turn up at least once in every magazine. :)
