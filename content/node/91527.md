  body: The closest I've found is [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection|United
    Sans Condensed]]. As [[http://dribbble.com/super_furry|Simon Walker]] (in charge
    of [[http://dribbble.com/super_furry/projects/2508-Austin-Eastciders|Austin Eastciders'
    identity]]) is very well known for his ability to work, customize and create fonts,
    it could also be a custom typeface (and may be based on United).
