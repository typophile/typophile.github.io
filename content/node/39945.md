  body: Please don't post into multiple forums. Also, consider putting your survey
    into an online survey tool like surveymonkey. You'll get a lot more responses.

  body: "I am doing a similar idea for my dissertation, I found that their are too
    many assumptions on typefaces, everyone has a different opinion and is hard to
    show a positive outcome on the feeling of the typeface.\r\nThere seems to many
    surveys and research of typefaces and their persona, Eva Brumburger to name but
    one.\r\n\r\ncompanies use Helvectica like Orange, American Airlines, Natwest,
    Panasonic, Jeep, iPhone, and 3M, from my research i found out that this font communicates:\r\n\r\nStraight
    Forward and no-nonsense, stability, Safe, Serious, a quote from the BBC:\r\n\r\n
    \"Helvetica's message is this: you are going to get to your destination on time;
    your plane will not crash; your money is safe in our vault; we will not break
    the package; the paperwork has been filled in; everything is going to be OK.\r\n\r\nTo
    me it seems boring, plain, no character or personality, just like everyone else.\r\n\r\nI
    felt no matter how much research i done, i could never really change anything,
    but instead add to the debate and discussion.\r\n\r\nWe describe the appearance
    of type in a very humanistic way, almost like how we describe people, just from
    how they look. This took my idea further.\r\n\r\nI decided if we could see more
    character within the typeface if we looked at certain individual characters from
    within. My results suggested that if we look at the components of each letter
    in more depth, we revile more answers, we begin to see their individual detail
    that we may of missed if they were arranged with other letters.\r\n \r\nI asked
    what human characteristics do these type characters have, and my results started
    to come back with actual human descriptions. Describing letters as people just
    from their form. The audience began to take notice of their individual components
    such their serifs, ascenders, descenders, loops, ears, counter, weight and overall
    shape much more.\r\n\r\nI am now in the process of creating a story with human
    characters being represented by letters! it seems a fun idea, and something that
    hasn't really been explored!!\r\n\r\nI created a  online questionnaire, and believe
    me i agree with  Aluminium, people don't like hassle, so make it easier for them.
    it really does help.\r\n\r\ncheck it out if you like:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.woodymedia.co.uk/uni/crabby/typequestionnaire.htm]]\r\n\r\n\r\n"
