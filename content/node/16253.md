  body: "Jack was proud of his lack of teeth. They got knocked out while he was slamming
    his head into a running back.  He also would chew an amalgum of garlic, onions,
    and Limbureger cheese before each game so that when he breathed on his opponents
    they would feel unloved. :-) He was not a gentle man.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
