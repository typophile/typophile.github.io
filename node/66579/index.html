<p><strong>Recap.</strong> It’s a conflict of interest if one:</p>
<ul><li>runs a commercial Web site (this site is commercial; it solicits money and runs ads) <em>and</em></li>
<li>accepts pay from a company that is in the same industry and is an occasional advertiser</li></ul>
<p>None of the other cases listed in comments above meets those criteria.</p>
<p>A really attentive reader, if there is one, which I doubt, will have noticed I did not set out any remedies, nor claim that the conflict of interest was (for example) deliberate, egregious, or untenable. Any number of options are available to rectify the matter. Two that aren’t available are doing nothing and denying a conflict of interest exists.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joe, I think you&rsquo;re the one deliberately avoiding the glaringly obvious problem: No matter how correct or authoritative your suggestions, your attitude and manner, conveyed in nearly every post, is one of disdain, condescension, disrespect and hostility. Go back and look at what you write. Witty, yes, but also highly repellent. It&rsquo;s more distressing to me that you often have a good point, and yet can&rsquo;t articulate it in any positive or civilized way, than it would be if you were just a tiresome and ignorant complainer.</p>
<p>Many have pointed this out: you have valuable input, and it&rsquo;s always coated in bile. You insult and belittle others on this board relentlessly, then cry hurt kitten paws when you perceive a slight or discredit (as in the Toronto subway font thread, among others). If you are unaware of this hypocrisy, please make yourself cognizant. Meanwhile you have no business lecturing us that we&rsquo;re ignoring the plentiful flaws in Typophile. Those problems are acknowledged.</p>
<p>You push others away with your negative and hostile approach. This is not irrelevant to your argument; it colors and impedes it. This is the sticking point, not a mass denial about mechanical problems with Typophile. This is not an evasion of the more pressing problem of non-compliant code. Your sour attitude is an unnecessary and unwelcome ingredient in every discussion you join. Stop pretending to be so offended and stop being so offensive. Stop sidestepping what must by now be a leitmotif of your correspondence. Nobody else brings as much judgement or bitterness to discussions here.</p>
<p>It has been noted that some of your suggested changes would deaden or scramble discussions here. Since discussions are the lifeblood of Typophile, and you clearly have only web standards compliance on your mind, who has the conflict of interest?</p>

<p>&ldquo;we see the world not as it is, but as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>you might be reading more into joe&rsquo;s posts than
he writes into them, or at least something different.</p>
<p>i mean, if there was &ldquo;disdain, condescension, disrespect
and hostility&rdquo; in all his posts, there wouldn&rsquo;t be room
for a good point or two, and even you have admitted
the presence of those, if only on the rare occasion&hellip;</p>
<p>what i see is &ndash; no matter how much sense he makes &ndash;
there are always people here who will tear joe down,
so i&rsquo;m not surprised he&rsquo;s adopted a confrontational tone.</p>
<p>and yes, i know that joe&rsquo;s tone is not limited to this arena,
and i&rsquo;m not blaming anyone here for the attitudes they hold
toward joe, but if you think you can beat his tone out of him,
then you&rsquo;ve got another thought coming.  i&rsquo;d suggest instead
that you playfully adopt him as your local curmudgeon and
try to learn as much from him as you possibly can.  won&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>i mean, seriously, if you want to be a spokesperson against
&ldquo;disdain, condescension, disrespect and hostility&rdquo;, please
don&rsquo;t exhibit them in your own posts.  that only makes sense&hellip;</p>

<p>In other words: there is no problem. At least not for me. But then: I am a relaxed middle aged guy, living comfortably in what is probably the best place in the world, with just some minor worries (What to eat tonight).</p>

<p>There very much is, and it&rsquo;s not Joe&rsquo;s tone.
The problem is something much worse: he doesn&rsquo;t know where he is.</p>

<p>Which I personally don&rsquo;t give a crap about,</p>
<p>&hellip;but when joke lark turns his frustrations on new bees who just walked in the Typophile door, I think it discredits the whole forum.</p>
<p>I assume joke lark wants to be stopped so he can complain about something more. Attention, attention, attention, he&rsquo;ll never get enough.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
