body: "I'm fairly new to type design and I have been using FontLab's TypeTool program
  which is great.\r\n\r\nI've been developing a font with a client and they have asked
  if the font could be restricted to a single color or multiple colors when used.
  \ I know this probably isn't possible, but I'm quite hopeful that someone may have
  found a way. We want to do this because non-designers will be using the typeface
  and it makes for easier 'policing' of the brand colors, I'm not a dictator I promise!\r\n\r\nWould
  greatly appreciate anybody's help."

    I doubt if it can be done). Just wanted to mention making making employees stick
    to graphic standards (such as colors) is a common problem, especially when they
    have no design training. Teaching them the rules is one thing; getting them to
    understand the importance of sticking to them is often the bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nYou
    need to educate them on the guidelines, have someone high up in the organization
    impress upon them that the company is serious about this, provide templates when
    you can, and have someone review documents they produce and tell them when they're
    doing it wrong."

  body: "The short answer is no, this is not possible, short of exotic or experimental
    font formats. You can't do it with TypeTool.\r\n\r\nWhat may be helpful to you
    is to define a palette of character and paragraph styles in your layout application
    and then instruct your designers to use those styles rather than build up their
    typographic formatting from scratch. Do the same thing with colors \u2014 add
    your corporate colors to the swatches menu and then remove everything else.\r\n\r\n(Especially
    if your designers are not experienced or not professionals, it may actually help
    to make them use InDesign or some other program they're unfamiliar with, rather
    than Word, as it may deter them from trying to mess with the settings. You can
    point them to the styles window and say, \"You choose what the type looks like
    by clicking on one of these styles.\" Of course, the better idea is having well-trained
    and intelligent designers who can both inhabit the brand guidelines and also adjust
    them as necessary in sensitive and appropriate ways. But since you asked about
    restrictions \u2026)"

    tools they're using. It'll be getting managers to enforce the rules. And many
    managers just won't care unless their bosses tells them it's important.\r\n\r\nI
    once saw a secretary modifying her company's logo with a marker pen (it was an
    outline logo and she filled it in). She told me she did it on every piece that
    left her office because she thought it looked better that way. Her manager didn't
    care. It didn't stop until someone higher up finally put their foot down."

    magic (and impossible) answer. I think the main application it's going to be used
    by employees is Microsoft Office ,so I think the best thing to do is look at some
    template themes/styles that can be easily saved and applied by the employees.\r\n\r\nAnd

    just aren't concerned about identity standards, they consider it nit-picky nonsense.
    That's why it's important for upper management to get behind the rules and expect
    compliance."
