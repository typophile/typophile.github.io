  body: I was initially confused, because Hangul Day for me is 9 October, but it seems
    in North Korea it's 15 January. I should have remembered that North Korea has
    a different date for it... Well, I guess it's an excuse to celebrate twice a year.

  body: "BTW, I'm very interested in \"progressive\" fonts in scripts I don't have
    nativity in (which is, like, all of them except three) and the Glendale area happens
    to have a huge Korean community, with their video rental stores exhibiting a dazzling
    spectrum of liberated letterforms. The other day I saw a pretty amazing rendition
    of Hangul - it almost looked like a totally different script - and I went back
    to take a photo... Well, that poster is gone, but I took the following four photos,
    and would be very interested in learning of how a native sees the type.\r\n\r\nSeeing
    as what day it is...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HangulPoster1_5651.jpg]\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTibetanized?
    Or just Euro-medieval?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HangulPoster2_5408.jpg]\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nCouldn't
    bear to chop off that pretty scalp.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HangulPoster3_4251.jpg]\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HangulPoster4_3873.jpg]\r\nIs
    this last one easily readable? That would a pleasant shock.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, that last one is indeed easily readable. (It says, literally, \"salt
    doll\". I was intrigued by this title, which I haven't seen before, and a quick
    bit of googling tells me it's the name of a TV drama series.) Informal lettering
    written with a brush is all the rage these days in South Korea, appearing on everything
    from food packaging, signs on restaurants, and TV titles.\r\n\r\nIt's fascinating
    for me to imagine how Korean lettering and fonts must look to those who don't
    read Korean. Being a native reader, it's not something I have had a chance to
    think about very often. I wouldn't have stopped to think that yes, it makes sense
    that someone who doesn't read Korean would wonder whether an example like the
    one above would be easily readable. I can't be completely objective in judging
    how my own familiarity affects how I read different scripts, but I think it's
    a credit to Hangul (and good news for Korean lettering artists) that the glyphs
    can be so playful and informal without hurting readability.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    ugh on that first example with all the pink and all the hearts. Though I just
    possibly may be bitter about having to do an all-night shift on St. Valentine's
    Day."
