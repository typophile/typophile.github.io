  body: "These are hints that are used to control vertical alignment of features that
    do not involve horizontal stems. The obvious example would be the top and bottom
    of a <em>sans serif</em> letter I. There is no serif to function as a horizontal
    stem, and hence nothing to which to link a standard stem hint. Ghost hints are
    used here to attach the top and bottom of the letter to vertical alignment (blue)
    zones.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ghosts_6193.png]\r\n"
