  \"Euro Sign\"? When is which one used? I live in Europe but never heard of the \"Euro-Currency
  Sign\" before. I just came across it here: http://alanwood.net/unicode/currency_symbols.html\r\n\r\nCan
  someone enlighten me please?"

  body: The 'Euro Currency Sign' preceded the Euro and was used to indicate the virtual
    European Currency Unit that was used in conversion rate calculations within the
    EU prior to the introduction of the Euro. When the latter was introduced with
    its official symbol, Unicode decided to give it a new codepoint rather than reusing
    the one that had been assigned to the virtual currency unit, to avoid possible
    confusion when dealing with older documents. The Euro Currency Sign character
    is effectively deprecated, since it is no longer in any regular use.
