  body: "A lot of interesting points, especially about scale.\r\n\r\nHowever, I disagree
    that \"...We are also seeing a gradual return to typeface design being a team
    enterprise ... the sheer volume of work required for text typefaces have driven
    a growth of mid-size foundries.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the 21st century
    has seen an explosion of entrepreneurial one-person foundries. A mid-sized foundry
    is a bit of a misnomer, as all foundries are small. Is the Reading course more
    geared to production workers than entrepreneurs and original-typeface designers?
    It would be interesting to know the whereabouts in the type industry of the majority
    of former students.\r\n\r\nI also don't believe that the origin of a type design
    is a brief. How about \"a crazy idea that just might work\"?\r\n\r\n(Sorry for
    not pursuing this on Ilt, I'm just more comfortable here.)\r\n"

    of the last century, and it is some of those foundries that have now grown into
    what I think are fairly called mid-size foundries -- in the relative scale of
    things --, in which the owners or senior designers collaborate with a number of
    design and technical employees. Hoefler & Frere-Jones is a good example of such
    an evolution.\r\n\r\n[At Tiro, we took a somewhat different direction, creating
    a network of associate designers with whom we collaborate on specific projects.]"

    to team enterprise\", but a situation where the majority are independents and
    solo part timers (e.g. also teaching or with an agency job), and a few foundries
    have split the work up.\r\n\r\nI'd say that both historical paradigms -- the industrial
    production model and the craftsman model -- are valid in the digital era.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Mark,\r\n\r\nBringhurst wrote that \"A script in itself is not a language\"
    (voices, languages and scritps around the world, Language and Culture).\r\n\r\nI
    think that the question is not if the designer does not know the language, but
    mainly what the designer does to overcome this obstacle. So, when Gerry writes
    that \"a typeface arises in response to a brief, which by definition taps into
    wider design problems\" I think that he missed  an important aspect:  a script
    is not  an OpenType font, nicely done.\r\n\r\nI would expect to read that the
    first task by the student would be to learn the history and culture of that specific
    script, or language, explore different historic resources e.g. MSS, old-old books,
    talk & meet native speakers. So the brief or any design problem related to that
    script is secondary. \r\n \r\nWhen we say that a specific non-latin design is
    \ successful, then the question is successful by whom? by native speakers?\r\n\r\n
    Moreover,  I don't agree with this statement: \"the  examples are so numerous
    it would be difficult to choose.\" On the contrary let's examine the examples. "

    At typefacedesign.org, you can see the names (and typeface designs) of all the
    students from the classes of 2000\u20132009 [with the exception of 2001 and 2002,
    which are still missing]. Many of the former students have blogs or websites,
    and I think that you can ascertain which of them are actively working in the font
    industry via simple google searches. But I suspect that you are already familiar
    with most of these names, or at least those who employed by\u2014or regularly
    work with\u2014Adobe, Dalton Maag, H&FJ, Linotype, Monotype, Porchez Typofonderie,

  body: "Reading a script, in my view anyway, is not about reading letters, but reading
    words, and if a designer doesn't have personal access to that psychological processing
    of proficient readers, I wonder if a designer isn't at a critical disadvantage.
    \r\n\r\nFor example, I believe all of the most popular typefaces in Israel were
    designed by Hebrew readers. David H., is this correct? I also was struck by the
    critical remarks of Satya Rajpurohit on Devanagari designs by students who don't
    read the script.\r\n\r\nI sure an excellent designer with study of the script
    can do a good job, but I wonder whether reading proficiency is not a big advantage. "

    are a lot of crap typefaces designed by native readers of any writing system --
    including plenty of Latin examples --, so I don't think reading proficiency can
    be counted as a <em>big</em> advantage or, indeed, a critical skill in type design.\r\n\r\nFurther,
    I can't read German or Spanish or Navajo or Wolof or the overwhelming majority
    of language written in the Latin writing system, but that doesn't prevent me from
    designing typefaces that are readable in those languages. [Note that this is a
    different matter from designing typefaces that are culturally appropriate to the
    typography of those languages in particular places.]\r\n\r\nSince you mention
    Satya's earlier remarks, it is worth calling to mind that some of the most famous
    and celebrated Indian typefaces were designed by someone who was illiterate even
    in his own language."

  body: What I intuit from my attempts at designing both non-latin scripts and glyph
    sets in languages that I do not read is that I am more tentative about deviation
    from what I have seen. I am less tentative about Greek than I am of Cyrillic because
    I spoke Greek as a child albeit not well. I even feel less confident in pushing
    the envelope with certain diacritics like cedilla or ogonek. I don't think it
    is not that I don't READ the language but I have yet arrived at the "Plato's Republic"
    level of "seeing forms" with those diacritics but now that I have been at it for
    6 years, I feel much more confident than I used to at my first  attempt in 2004.
    Increased confidence in other scripts and languages is mostly thanks to numerous
    interactions here on Typophile or offline with willing teachers like Maxim, Filip,
    Miguel, Adam, Gerry, and Klimis.

    perspective, not picking nits. After all, that brief article wasn't a detailed
    explanation of how teaching and research at Reading work \u2014 that would be
    a different and much longer thing \u2014 but just an overview of some themes that
    have emerged over the years.\r\n\r\nDesigning type for a script you can't read
    or write is really, really tricky, and it definitely involves a lot of research
    and enough modesty to realize how much you rely on the feedback of others with
    a better feel for it. But it can be done \u2014 and done well \u2014 by designers
    who take the time and care to learn how a script works and then add to that the
    less script-specific understanding of how to get letters to work as type."
