    there that care about the opening credits sequence. long gone are the good old
    days of Saul Bass and the like, but at least we still get a few of these nuggets
    each year.\r\n\r\nanother recent great opening title sequence was in Kiss Kiss,
    Bang Bang, which had a very Catch Me If You Can meets Saul Bass-esque quality
    to it, while still being unique enough to be something of it's own. <a href=\"http://www.sixteentwenty.tv/movies/qt_kkbb.html\">check
    it out here</a>."

    is the TV show Medium - unfortunately can't find it on the web easily (try googling
    \"medium\" and you'll see what I mean). But it's beautiful, plays with Rorschach
    images."

  body: "Ooohhhhhh I was <em>so</em> excited for this movie. This is one of my favorite
    novels. One of my high school teachers knew Chris Buckley personally, and every
    year, after he made us read the book, would get the class artist (guess who it
    was my year?) make him a poster. So I like to think that somewhere in his house
    is a very creative cigarette (I rolled mine up, clever clever). \r\n\r\nWe almost
    crossed paths again when Mr. Buckley was the guest on the Colbert Report when
    I saw it taped a couple of weeks ago. \r\n\r\nHowever, the movie was a bit of
    a letdown for me (aside from the titles), only because I knew the book so well.
    The person I saw it with assured me that it was enjoyable and they hadn't read
    the book, but I urge you all to do so. It's much more... I won't say because I
    don't want to spoil anything, but the book is excellent.\r\n\r\nSorry, I had to
    get that off my chest. Love the titles. I bet whoever made them had fun."

    about which typefaces they're using in opening titles; this film was no exception.\r\n\r\nQuestion:
    Any thoughts on how they achieved the wonderful look of flexographic printing?
    Surely they didn't actually print these and then scan them in. Some sort of Photoshop
    filter? Any ideas? I'd love to be able to replicate the look."
