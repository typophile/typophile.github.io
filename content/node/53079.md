  body: 'I really like version 2.jpg I would suggest integrating the leaves on top
    with the rest of the design. Maybe you could use the styling you have on the middle
    section (the yellow with white interiors) or create the outlines out of dots so
    it''s a little more organic looking. And it seems like you could get away with
    placing a seed in the type to dot the i so that if the type were used outside
    of the logo there would be a reference to the overall idea. '

  body: "I like your drawing but somehow this feel like a logo for a product not a
    store.\r\n\r\nLike something you would see on a bag of candied strawberries.\r\n\r\nBut
    all the designs are very cute .\r\n\r\nThe text set in maze yellow is too low
    contrast against white. try a darker color.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
