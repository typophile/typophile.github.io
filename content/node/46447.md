body: "Greetings all!\r\n\r\nBelow are some sketches for a new serif font that for
  the moment is called Ibis. It is inspired by ancient Egyptian art and architecture,
  though it's not based on any specific model. I did not start on it with any particular
  function in mind, though I guess it might find use as a display font.\r\n\r\nThis
  is my first serif typeface, and my motivation for it is partly to learn, so any
  and all feedback is welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ibis_draft_4680.gif]"

  body: 'This font has an interesting feeling but there is not enough consistency
    of weight between characters. So M & N are heavy, but the O is light. Why? It
    is almost always a good idea to make the glyphs seem to have a similar optical
    weight meaning the look like they are rather than being literally the same weight.
    How do you think someone might use this? '

  body: "Eben, I agree the weight was too inconsistent in that draft. I guess I was
    too anxious to get feedback. I have now done more work on the weights and added
    new samples to the first post - I hope these look better.\r\n\r\nI wrote in the
    original post that I thought \"it might find use as a display font\". Now I believe
    the font could also work for shorter paragraph text (see pdf #2). What do you
    think?\r\n\r\nAs before, all suggestions are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nM\xE5ns"

  body: It is getting better but I have my doubts about it becoming a text face. But
    I suppose it depends on where you take it. Especially if you are aiming at a text
    oriented design in time I think you will have to continue to look at the weight
    that each character seems to have. I say seems because it's just perception. Following
    a plan and measuring won't get you there. You have to do it by eye. The bottom
    of the i & m and so on still catch my eye. They are so heavy compared to the bases
    of letters around them!  In contrast the top & bottom of the s are very light.
    This makes the type seem to flicker as you read it which is not comfortable over
    a paragraph. Keep on going. But also look closely at other designs. I am not saying
    copy them but between styles you may see that similar approaches are used to solve
    for an even feeling or look. Consider using those.
