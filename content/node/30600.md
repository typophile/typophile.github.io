  body: Definitely <em>not</em> <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.6439.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=jetlag+travel+guides&sampleSize=24">Alternate
    Gothic No. 2</a> as it is too narrow and the sides are too straight. It might've
    been <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.6439.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=jetlag+travel+guides&sampleSize=24">Alternate
    Gothic No. 3</a> but the lc 'a' shape doesn't seem to match perfectly. Mike's
    suggestion on the other hand <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.108133.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=jetlag+travel+guides&sampleSize=24">perfectly
    fits the bill</a>.
