body: I'm designing business cards and I would like for the kerning/letter spacing
  of the letters to look right.. i dont have 2 much knowledge on the subject so thought
  I would ask here.. is there any tips/guidelines I can look at? I'm concerned about
  some letters like V,K,W,A.. letters with slants in them confuse me so before I go
  ahead and submit the design to have these cards printed I would like to figure this
  out.. Where can I find information on which letters should get tighter kerning than
  others? What about spaces in words? is there a way to figure out how big the space
  should be?

    kerning as a matter of course...
