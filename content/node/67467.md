body: Hi all, I'm working on a logotype using [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typetogether/bree_complete/|Bree]]
  and am trying to find a complementary font for use in the rest of the identity package.
  It's a somewhat unique face so I'm thinking maybe something fairly non-descript?
  I'm leaning towards wanting a sans but I'm not entirely set on that. Any suggestions
  very welcome, thanks.

    really fitting Bree) and some very appealing serifs.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.type-together.com"

    from using a serif as they've already shown a preference for sans typefaces thus
    far in the project. Any thoughts on a sans that might fit Bree? Or I wonder if
    using Bree with the alternate characters (i.e. not the unique g, k, y, z) might
    actually work?"
