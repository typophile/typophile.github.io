body: "Hi everyone \r\n\r\nCould someone please explain to a soon to be first year
  student Graphic design when to use the optical kerning and when to use metrics (Indesign
  CS4)?\r\n\r\nIs it so that when using like headings it would be wise to use \"optical\"
  kerning and for plain text in small size corps to use Metrics? or does this depend
  on the font used?\r\n\r\nAlso  how about justification function in Indesign, is
  there like a golden tip as to what percentage to use for word spacing (minimum,
  desired, maximum) someone once told me that minimum should be always at 70% and
  maximum at 120%, is this true? \r\n\r\nwhat about letter spacing? Is it better to
  just leave everything at default, and when do you actually change letter spacing,
  i never really touch the letter spacing (minimum, desired, maximum)function and
  leave it at 0%, thinking that the guy who designed the typeface knows best and thus
  i leave it at default.\r\n\r\ndo you guys have like settings you almost always use?\r\n\r\nThank
  you again for all the help, learning a great deal here at Typophile!"

  body: "When the type designer did his/her work, he took decisions about kerning:
    if you trust him, stick to the Metrics option. I only use Optical kerning if I
    have two different fonts and/or very contrasting point sizes in the same line
    (for instance, the rare case when the first letter of the word is a Script font
    and the rest is set in a Roman typeface), or if the spacing and/or kerning of
    the font is terrible. But, if this is the case, it is better to forget it and
    choose another font.\r\n\r\nNow, for headlines you must check letter spacing and
    adjust slighty (trust in your eye, not in the Optical kerning option). That is
    because the type designer probably didn\u2019t think about the particular word
    and the point size you are using.\r\n\r\nAbout justification: depends on how perfectionist
    you are and how much time you have. Typically, my minumum is 90% and my maximum
    110%, but if I have narrow columns I allow more flexible values."
