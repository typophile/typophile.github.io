body: "I think the following might be of some interesting to both type and web designers.
  \r\n\r\nThe context is the appearance of @font-face embedded fonts on Windows with
  ClearType disabled, and Standard smoothing used instead. As you probably know this
  tends to make a few fonts look somewhat anorexic and illegible. After a bit of experimenting
  I found two simple CSS tricks that can help with this issue. Clearly nothing can
  be done about reshaping individual letters, but their appearance <em>can</em> be
  improved. Have a look:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cleartype_5892.png]\r\n<code></code>\r\n\r\nFrom
  top to bottom:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>ClearType\r\n<li>Standard smoothing\r\n<li>Standard
  smoothing, CSS trick #1\r\n<li>Standard smoothing, CSS trick #2\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nTrick
  #1 is to place a semi-transparent copy of the text on top of the original. Here,
  for example, the opacity is set to 80%. Optimal opacity value seems to depend on
  the text color, the darker the color - the more transparent the overlay needs to
  be.\r\n\r\nTrick #2 is to use text-shadow with 0px blur radius and slightly lighter
  color. This is limited to every normal browser that supports text shadows, meaning
  that it won't work in the IE.\r\n\r\nLastly, this can be combined with JavaScript
  detection of font smoothing to conditionally enable these tweaks depending on user's
  anti-aliasing setting. Again, on normal browsers it is possible to tell ClearType,
  Standard and no smoothing apart. On IE it is far more murkier. It has <em>fontSmoothingEnabled</em>
  variable, but it is effectively useless as the IE does not smooth fonts if ClearType
  is not enabled, and yet it would set this variable to <em>true</em>... erm, yeah.\r\n\r\nIn
  any case, it's a curious hack that may come handy in some cases. Thought I'd share
  it.\r\n\r\n<img src=http://swapped.cc/img/sig.png>"

    Also tried pushing IE into changing the size of the rendered text when switching
    the CT on and off (by using tiny font sizes, odd letter spacing and characters)
    - no luck. I have all but given up on this, and resorted to looking at the IE

    that is true, often they simply don\u2019t know, that they can profit from changing
    the defaults \u2013 and not only when they visit your website. You naturally cannot
    expect, that they install anything only because of <em>your</em> website. So I
    think, that it won't do any harm to teach them in a friendly and motivating way.
    And if the visitor ignores your before-and-after-images, it may be, that he either
    is not really interested in the content of your website, or he is contented enough
    with the actual look of your website. You could store some instructions on a central
    place of your website, how to improve the look (of your and other websites) with
    Cleartype. Not only with Cleartype, but with the Cleartype tuner, which I have
    installed on XP. From a certain point of view you support lazyness, if you contaminate
    the markup. It is comparable with the following: One of your friends does not
