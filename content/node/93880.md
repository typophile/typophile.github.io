  Retina Display), seems like good time to restart this question:\r\nWhat do you see
  as the future of TrueType hinting? The short-term value is obvious. I get it. I'm
  with you.\r\nBut when breaking out the checkbook, how do we measure the value of
  hinting in the context of improving rasterizers, iOS's limited appetite for hinting,
  screen resolution, etc.? \r\n\r\nThis is an honest question, not a statement. It's
  a wonderful, daunting, inspiring, confusing time of possibilities and pitfalls.
  \r\nLove to read some thoughts on this, in light of Apple's news. Many thanks.\r\n"

  body: "I was waiting for this thread to be started.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest impact
    of the new hi-res screens is going to be how pixels are seen by web designers.
    Up till now, a pixel was a fixed measurement, equal to a point (on most screens).
    Whereas in print, pixels (or printed dots) have always been of different sizes
    and therefore irrelevant as far measuring things goes, in the world of the web,
    the length of something in pixels has always dictated how big it is, in terms
    of real-world size (inches, etc). Now, finally, that will have to change, as 220
    pixels on one screen will be the same actual size as 72 pixels on another. The
    only difference will be that the first is a higher resolution \u2014 an attribute
    that now, for the first time on the web, is independent of actual size.\r\n\r\nSo
    I'm waiting to see a paradigm shift where web designers will have to specify the
    size of things in real-world terms, and let the browser sort out how big to make
    each pixel. In other words, the concepts of \"resolution\" and \"size\" on screen
    will start to be understood more like the way they always have been in print."

    -- up to a certain point, at least.\r\nOn an iPad 3, if you used 'regular' interface
    commands, dimensions in \"pixels\" are silently doubled. However, if your software
    generates a bitmap in memory and copy it \"manually\" on to the screen, the image
    will be too small.\r\n\r\nFrustratingly, Apple still calls their old resolution
    \"1 pixel\" -- to make sense of high-resolution coordinates you are now supposed
    to deal with \"1/2 pixels\" as well!"

    prepared in a paint program, for example on [[http://www.quadibloc.com/crypto/te0302.htm|this
    page]]. They would not be legible if displayed at an arbitrary resolution where
    1 pixel in the image translated to 1 1/8 pixels on the screen.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    specifying image sizes in inches, for example, is not an option, since then, although
    the images might be legible enough on a very high-resolution display like the
    Retina display, they wouldn't be legible on different resolutions (60 dpi - old
    Macintosh, 72 dpi - common Windows, 96 dpi, 144 dpi, alternate Windows) on conventional
    computers.\r\n\r\nInstead, Apple's current solution, of having a real pixel be
    equal to 1/2 or 1/4 of a virtual pixel, does work.\r\n\r\nIdeally, in future,
    I would have to change how I specify image sizes, but how it would be done would
    be to specify image sizes in pixels, but then also note a base screen resolution:
    above twice that resolution, each pixel would be replaced by an integer number
    of pixels.\r\n\r\ni.e., if I specify the base screen resolution as 72 dpi, then
    at resolutions from 144 dpi to 215 dpi, each pixel becomes a 2 x 2 square, at
    resolutions from 216 dpi to 287 dpi, each pixel becomes a 3 x 3 square, and so
    on.\r\n\r\nThat would combine resolution-independence with the ability to control
    the relationship of image pixels to screen pixels.\r\n\r\nNaturally, for things
    like photos, it should also be possible to specify image size in inches, where
    resizing will not injure visibility."

  body: "There is some confusion here. At least with iOS and OSX, there is no 'thinking
    different' (pun not intended) about pixels for web designers.\r\n\r\nDesigning
    something 10px square in mobile Safari, and setting type to 8px will result in
    the same physical sized elements on a retina display as on a non-retina display.
    \r\n\r\nAs previously stated, this is because apple now treats a 'pixel' as a
    more virtual concept. On retina displays, it uses 4 device pixels to render the
    one 'code' pixel.\r\n\r\nSo, generically speaking, a web designer has to do nothing
    to accommodate retina displays. \r\n\r\nIf they do want to give retina users higher
    resolution images (Again, displayed at the same size) there are a few steps they
    need to take care of, but it's nothing daunting.\r\n\r\nWhat is frustrating for
    web/mobile designers, however, are the other high-density screens being developed
    that don't do what Apple does. Instead they just use smaller pixels. Some of the
    BlackBerries do this and it causes issues in that the designer sees everything
    smaller on the device compared to the iPhone so insists that we resize everything
    for the BlackBerry. However, they often fail to realize that EVERYTHING is smaller
    on that user's BlackBerry so the user has already likely taken steps to change
    the defaults to their liking to begin with. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that high
    density screens are going to cause weird problems going forward--at least until
    all OSes start using resolution independent rendering. But Apple is the one place
    where we shouldn't see too many problems. "

    your typeface, but isn't it something you consider when making the decision to
    invest lots of time and resources at your foundry to add hinting information?
    If better screens improve the display of the typeface, that would seem to lessen
    the motivation of designers and publishers to invest in hinting. Wouldn't that
    affect your decisions?\r\n\r\nLikewise, there are third parties who can do this

    draft:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/\r\n\"Note that this definition
    of the pixel unit and the physical units differs from previous versions of CSS.
    In particular, in previous versions of CSS the pixel unit and the physical units
    were not related by a fixed ratio: the physical units were always tied to their
    physical measurements while the pixel unit would vary to most closely match the
    reference pixel. (This change was made because too much existing content relies
    on the assumption of 96dpi, and breaking that assumption breaks the content.)
    \"\r\n\r\nGranted, it's still up to browsers to decide what to do and not all
    care. For instance, there are several high-density BlackBerry devices where the
    pixels are simply smaller. Which is unlike the iOS reitina implementation where
    the 'real' pixels are much smaller, but the 'virtual' pixels remain the same offering
    a more predictable rendering in terms of physical size.\r\n\r\nAt some point the
    operating systems/OSes will have to just do away with the concept of pixels altogether
    (at least from the perspective of the content authors). As we approach much higher
    density screens, adopting a resolution independent system would make more sense.
    That way 1\" = 1\" regardless of the particular screen. Fingers crossed. "

    back to the first iPhone. Web pixels (\"px\") almost never correspond to device
    pixels. The page is scaled to the device based on the nominal width of the page.
    Sites designed for narrower widths will appear bigger than sites designed for
    wider widths. All images and text are scaled accordingly. (This can be annoying
    when you are trying to look at screenshots posted on a website.)\r\n\r\nThe only
    way to force exact pixel correspondence in Mobile Safari is to set the page width
    to the same width as the pixel width of the view (vertical or horizontal orientation)

    don't think so. Low level hinting is already obsolete without the high resolution
    hardware, because the latest Apple, Microsoft and Libre font rendering system
    software can render unhinted fonts well enough. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that the
    old Microsoft rendering system software (\"GDI\") is hard-coded by many Windows
    applications - so the new DirectWrite system software isn't used even if it is
    available (c.f. Google Chrome today) \r\n\r\nI expect plugging in an Apple Retina
    screen to a Windows 8 computer that is running such 'legacy' software is unlikely
    to render text any better than the previous screen. The Retina display drivers
    will use 4 or 8 hardware pixels to represent 1 pixel in legacy software, so it
    will look the same as it always has. \r\n\r\nBecause that is what businesses want;
    change on their schedule, which might be never. \r\n\r\nWhen you peek at the computer
    on the checkout stand at the grocery store, you'll often see a Windows 7 computer
    running a VT100 terminal emulator with a UI that looks like this:\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Linux-menuconfig.png\"
    />\r\n\r\nIf the software using GDI rendering is updated to use DirectWrite, then
    even on old screens an unhinted font will render fine.\r\n\r\n<em>But when breaking
    out the checkbook, how do we measure the value of hinting in the context of improving
    rasterizers, iOS's limited appetite for hinting, screen resolution, etc.?</em>\r\n\r\nIf
    you are going to pay for hinting, my suggestion is to make a contribution to the
    http://freetype.org/ttfautohint/ project and use it to bridge the gap between
    now and the time when most people are no longer using applications linked to GDI."

    hinting be necessary when 300dpi high-res screens are the standards?</a>\r\n\r\nReally?
    This conversation again? Yeesh.\r\n\r\nPosted elsewhere:\r\n\r\nhttp://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2010/06/apple-retina-display/\r\n\r\n\u201CSo,
    if a normal human eye can discriminate two points separated by 1 arcminute/cycle
    at a distance of a foot, we should be able to discriminate two points 89 micrometers
    apart which would work out to about 287 pixels per inch. Since the iPhone 4G display
    is comfortably higher than that measure at 326 pixels per inch, I\u2019d find
    Apple\u2019s claims stand up to what the human eye can perceive.\u201D\r\n\r\nSee
    also:\r\n\r\nCurcio, C. A., Sloan, K. R., Kalina, R. E. & Hendrickson, A. E. (1990).
    Human photoreceptor topography. <em>Journal of Comparative Neurology, 292</em>,
    497\u2013523.\r\n\r\nLong short, there\u2019s only so much detail the human eye
    is physically capable of detecting. Sure, if we get in an look at the type 1 cm
    away we\u2019ll see a difference, but at 12 inches, ~300 DIP is our threshold.
    Beyond this neither resolution nor hinting make a significant difference. \r\n\r\nTake
    the hint. It\u2019s pretty much dead (and before you say it, yes, there will always
    be a crappy ATM in a third-world country airport).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also important
    to point out that the people arguing for the importance of hinting are quite possibly
    the most biased population you could ask. The bulk of them stand to pro\uFB01t
    from its significance. You\u2019d be hard pressed to get a type designer who gets
    paid to hint to admit what they do is makes no significant difference aesthetically,
    in measures of human performance, and will eventually become extinct.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cof_5544.jpg]"

  body: "What Si said.\r\n\r\nI've no problem with the notion that hinting gets less
    relevant at higher resolutions and will eventually be either unnecessary or easily
    automated for the kind of resolutions we're looking at in an increasing number
    of mobile devices. But we're not there yet. \r\n\r\nI'll also point out that hinting
    isn't just a technology for making type look nice in otherwise friendly conditions,
    which seems to be all you're thinking about. Hinting is also a tool for addressing
    frankly unfriendly conditions, such as inherited vertical device metrics. We spent
    a lot of time over the past year trying to squeeze ten Indic scripts into the
    vertical metrics of a Latin UI font -- don't ask! -- and hinting was essential
    to the process of making the forms legible at target ppem sizes.\r\n\r\nIts not
    like we're going around the place selling hinting services to people who don't
    need them, Christopher. Clients come to us because they discover problems that
    need hinting solutions."

    standard screens, concave stems becomes visible at about 40px or up.\r\nIn retina,
    you see the concave effect at 16px.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to remove anything,
    but below a certain threshold details becomes invisible.  In retina, instead,
    that threshold is much smaller and much more details are now visible (for good
    or worst :)\r\n"

  body: "I would tend to think that 300 dpi is enough <em>for a display</em>, because
    we know from our experience with laser printers that while 60 dpi is crude dot-matrix
    printing, 300 dpi seemed indistinguishable from the product of fully-formed character
    printers.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is also true that this initial impression was flawed,
    because 300 dpi was still a tad fuzzy, and certain types of subtle detail in some
    typefaces - notably the flared stems of Optima, for example - were lost.\r\n\r\nBut
    in a display, unlike with a laser or ink-jet printer, one can control the color
    of each pixel exactly. So if one combines a technique like Microsoft's ClearType
    with a 300 dpi display, which, unlike hinting, can be carried out in an automated
    fashion, I think the results will meet any reasonable standard of <em>adequacy</em>.\r\n\r\nThat
    doesn't mean that there's anything <em>wrong</em> with pursuing higher resolutions
    when the technology gets to the point that they will be easily available, but
    it does mean that at 300 dpi, there will not be any <em>pressing</em> need to
    seek further improvements in display resolution... and, thus, there will be a
    disinclination on the part of consumers to pay premium prices for higher resolutions
    beyond this level."
