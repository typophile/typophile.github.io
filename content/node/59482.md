  brush title. I am co-designing or consulting on the overall layout of the cover
  and font choices. The title is now final. Early layouts tested Lithos and Optima
  for the subhead directly below the title, and now people are leaning towards a version
  of Copperplate Gothic (no serifs). \r\n\r\nIt's not bad, but what to put WITH it
  is challenging. What is the vernacular with this font? Serif fonts like Bodoni or
  Times have been tried but seem to have no relationship at all and are jarring. I'd
  love thoughts on this. "

    Maybe I'll re-post with a more general but equally burning question about vernacular
    in general. But focused on Copperplate and its 1400 variations. Surely there is
    someone out there who is a fan of this face and how to mix it into contemporary
    design?????\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you so much! I did do a search for articles before posting but missed
    this one. It is just amazing to have such a resource here at typophile. I went
    to all the links, and was fascinated to learn more of the history of the face
    and the obsessive connection people have to it on the Speak Up Archive. The conversation
    about what makes a font used or \"tired\" is pretty eternal. I have always loved
    Copperplate and considered it one of the eternal greats. But I'm hugely outnumbered.\r\n\r\nAs
    I looked more closely the font the designer is considering is bafflingly like
    CP but without serifs. I had thought there was a sans serif version out there
    but can't find it, so I have no idea now what it actually is. Which opens up the
    box of vernacular in another way: what does it do to the idea of family or logical
    historical relationship/context when something is old but stripped of some essential
    identifying feature? Years ago a young designer came to me to show her book, and
    I couldn't fathom the font choices. When I asked why she had mixed the particular
    stew together she told me it was \"on trend.\" The conversation sort of stopped
    there.\r\n\r\nI'd like to learn a lot more about the design philosophy that guides
    other Typophile members in their choices of what to companion with what. I'll
    do some browsing, but if someone can send me to specific previous threads that
    would be great."

  body: Good idea! Unfortunately right now it is in development, and I probably shouldn't.
    But it is a brush calligraphic script. Soft subtle italic, not too fancy. Sets
    off well with sans serif snuggling up, but then they wanted a serif contrast below
    the sans serif Copperplate mystery font, and it seems to me maybe a serif font
    that is soft and influenced by brushwork would be good. That would relate back
    to the title style. I could use some suggestions for fonts that have some calligraphic
    relationship to contemporary scripts styles. My font base is old--Trajan and Hiroshige
    are not going to cut it for this century!

    by Inland Type Foundry in 1900, predating Goudy's Copperplate Gothic by three
    years. Later part of the ATF library when Inland joined ATF. \r\n\r\nJim Spiece
    did a digital version for ITC back in the 1990s."
