  body: I checked their homepage but it&#39;s just too small. I&#39;ll  <BR>have to
    wait for you to post a big enough sample.

  body: Sorry about the broken upload. I uploaded a PNG, which previews okay but then
    the real thing doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve just done the same again in this post,
    and although I can edit this post the relevant &#92;magic&#123;word&#125; codes
    don&#39;t seem to work from an edit. I&#39;ve temporarily put the file up at <a
    href="http://www.ma.man.ac.uk/~rhouston/UM_logo.png"> this link</a>; hope that&#39;s
    not too inconvenient.

  body: The easy way out would be to say this is a custom  <BR>designed logo inspired
    by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/perpetua-2/perpetua/testdrive.html?s=UNIVERSITY%20MANCHESTER&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Perpetua</a>, but maybe somebody  <BR>else has an idea. It&#39;s
    just past midnight and I&#39;ve got  <BR>to catch up on some sleep. I&#39;ll check
    tomorrow how the ID  <BR>is faring.

    Seminar</a> is a better match. It&#39;s good you have to sleep sometimes Yves,
    it gives the rest of us a chance too ;-&#41;

  body: Thanks for the Gill connection, it&#39;s a good one. &#40;I&#39;ve just realised
    that&#41; the university uses Perpetua Bold for letter headings and so forth,
    so - assuming that someone planned it all at some stage - it makes sense that
    the logo would be related. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/gill-facia-mt/regular-display/?s=UNIVERSITY%20MANCHESTER">Gill
    Facia</a> is tantalisingly close, even has the <b>A</b>.  <BR> <BR>The <b>T</b>
    isn&#39;t right though. Perhaps &#34;custom logo in the style of Eric Gill&#34;
    is as good as I&#39;m going to get; or is there more to say? Have I overlooked
    another Gill design?
