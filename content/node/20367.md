  body: "Incidentally, the font that is seen on the Coudal site depends on what you
    have installed on your computer. Here is part of the style sheet for the headings:\r\n\r\n<code>font-family:
    times, Times New Roman, times-roman, georgia, serif;</code>\r\n\r\nUsually some
    version of Times, but not necessarily, and not necessarily the same version of
    Times as other people are seeing.\r\n\r\nAlso, the reason it looks different than
    Times usually looks (and the probably the reason it shows up in the Type ID topic
    sometimes) is that they made the spacing tighter (via the style sheet)."
