  body: "Can you get images of any of these papers for us to see? Prior to Linotype,
    they would have probably used some basic body type from one of the smaller foundries
    that eventually became part of ATF. I don't recall which individual foundries
    had offices out west. By the 1920s, at least, ATF had a branch sales office in
    Portland.\r\n\r\nFor text, probably something in a Modern or Century vein. For
    headlines, there are a number of typical faces. Most of these would have gone
    by pretty mundane descriptive names at the time -- things like Headletter Condensed,
    Adstyle Headletter, Modern Roman Condensed.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of faces
    in the Font Bureau library that are derived from some of these turn-of-the-century
    headletters. If you want specific recommendations to replicate the Lebanon papers,
    we'll need some visuals to go off of. Can you print out from microfiche and then
    scan something in to post?\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"Barreled Berries\" and \"Local Strawberries\" looks like ATF's Extra Condensed
    Title Gothic No. 12 to me. Do you mean Red Rooster's Block Gothic? That's got
    a similar turn-of-the-century headletter gothic feeling. But use all-caps only.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas
    1925\" is Cooper from Barnhart Brothers & Spindler. The \"mushroomed\" serifs
    are a dead giveaway.\r\n\r\nThe smaller dark headline looks familiar, but I can't
    place it offhand. I thought it was ATF Miehle Extra Condensed, but not quite.\r\n\r\n\"Published
    Every Wednesday\" looks like a Cheltenham. \r\n\r\nHard to say what the text or
    the subheads are from these lo-res samples. Maybe someone else will want to take
    a stab at it.\r\n\r\nThe line in \"L\" seems to be part of the style. Blackletter
    is not my area of expertise, so I can't tell you why that element is part of the
    style.\r\n\r\n"
