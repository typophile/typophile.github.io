    like a ten fold espresso shot at once ;-)

  body: hey jos, thanks. again. But your type is the foundation of that work. i'm
    not sure it looks so nice with "Comic sans" type instead of the Diavlo. ahhah.

  body: Jos, your fonts are some of my favorites to use, and I love seeing them used
    in settings like these. This is one of the reasons I want to design type; that
    feeling when you see your type in use must be fantastic.

    they have little horns and the overall look is quite sharp I wanted some devilish
    name for it. My first working title was Diavolo but a font by that name already
    existed ... hence the name Diavlo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g_6536.png]"

  body: "I just want to say : I've used this one for that exhibition because Victor
    Prouv\xE9 was an \"Art nouveau\" artist. And well, i think Diavlo suggests perfectly
    the interest of that artistic way for Nature. It makes me think of twigs, leafs,
    etc..."
