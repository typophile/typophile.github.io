body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am seeking some clarification on a couple of different subjects,
  if you can bear with me. [FYI: I am using FontLab Studio 5, and Microsoft's FontTools
  on Windows Vista in production of an OpenType TT font]\r\n\r\nFirst off, let's start
  at the beginning...of the font, that is; Microsoft's <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm\"><em>Recommendations
  for OpenType Fonts</em></a> states that in TT(-OT) fonts, the first four glyphs
  must be .notdef, .null, CR and space to allow for the same version of the font to
  work on both Windows and Macintosh.\r\n\r\nHowever I haven't seen this followed
  in any of the other fonts I have referenced (ACaslonPro, ChaparralPro, and others
  of the sort). I haven't decompiled the font files and looked at the tables, I merely
  opened the font files in FontLab. Have I overlooked something (besides the fact
  that they are Adobe fonts and not Microsoft), or are these fonts really without
  the specified glyphs?\r\n\r\nI have added the above mentioned glyphs to my font
  already, but I was just wondering, for future reference (and dependent on the answer
  to the above): a) if FontLab Studio will add these glyphs automatically and in the
  correct placement if they are missing, or b) these requirements are only recommendations,
  and only need be followed for cross-platform compatibility? In other words, if one
  or more of these glyphs are omitted or missing, will that cause any problems (either
  for generation or usage)?\r\n\r\nMy second question is also about the Microsoft
  Recommendations; it states <em>\"Character U+000D (carriage return) should map to
  a glyph with a positive advance width.\"</em> This also is not present in the fonts
  I have referenced. Should I make CR's advanced width; a) just a couple of units
  wide, b) make it's width something like the space character for example, or c) just
  not worry about it and leave it at zero?\r\n\r\nMy third question is in relation
  to building the kerning classes for an OT font. This is actually the question I
  wanted to ask, but I figured I would ask all of my silly questions at once in order
  to minimize your exposure to my ignorance. ;)\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, how
  do you folks set up your kerning classes? Do you follow the convention of setting
  up an 'alphabet' styled set of classes, like this:\r\n_a: a' aacute agrave adieresis\r\n_c:
  c' ccedilla\r\n_e: e' eacute egrave\r\netc...\r\n\r\nOr do you follow Adam Twardoch's
  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16413\">theoretical example</a> and use something
  like this:\r\n_flatflat: n' m h u ntilde uacute ugrave\r\n_flatround: p' b\r\n_roundround:
  o' oacute ograve\r\n_roundflat: c' d e q ccedilla eacute\r\n\r\nI understand that
  it is largely a matter of preference, and I would probably use the first example
  myself [mainly for aesthetic reasons], but the second example seems to me to be
  just a bit more efficient.\r\n\r\nAlso, Karsten, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/38773\">in
  another thread</a>, stated the following:\r\n<em>\"For my fonts, I strictly set
  up classes as either leftside or rightside classes in FLS, even if some leftside
  and rightside classes share the same set of glyphs -- and upon generating fonts
  I automatically 'merge' classes with identical content into a single class. This
  may illustrate that the separation helps avoid (or track down) errors during production
  but is not at all a requirement as regards OT fonts.\"</em>\r\n\r\nI am fairly comfortable
  with the concept and execution of classes in FontLab and I'm about to embark on
  creating my kerning classes, but was curious about the statement <em>\"...I automatically
  'merge' classes with identical content into a single class...\"</em> above. I scoured
  the manual fairly well, but found no reference to this being a feature or option
  in FontLab Studio.\r\n\r\nIs Karsten referring to something done manually when preparing
  to generate the font, like if I said; <em>\"I automatically go through each glyph
  and set the reference point to 0,0 as a fetish\"</em>? Or is this actually a \"feature\"
  somewhere that I have missed? Having that done programmatically would save a lot
  of fussy work after the classes have been set up, and avoid classes like these (in
  case I forget to 'merge' them):\r\n_a_1st: a' aacute agrave adieresis\r\n_a_2nd:
  a' aacute agrave adieresis\r\netc...\r\n\r\nAny clarification on any of the above
  would be most appreciated. Sorry for the huge post, and thank you for your time
  and your insight.\r\n\r\n-Duncan"

  body: "In answer to your first question, about the required characters, FontLab
    will add them automatically by default if they are absent. The reason they were
    missing in the fonts you mention is because they were not TT-based.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to kerning classes, I think the important thing is to set them up in a
    way that makes the most sense to you. My own system is similar to what Adam describes,
    but I try to make the groupings easy to remember and avoid including glyphs with
    different ascender and descender attributes."

  body: "@Mark: Thanks. Yeah, being non TT-based would make them not conform to the
    TT specs, I suppose. :) I knew I had missed something!\r\n\r\nAlso, I went through
    the FLS5 manual again, and and found something I had overlooked in the \"Font
    Header\" section, under the TrueType Mapping Settings [cmap Table]:\r\n\r\n\"If
    the <code>Automatically Add...</code> option is on, then FontLab Studio will analyse
    the font and add characters that are necessary for complete font compatibility.
    In Windows only two characters are really necessary: the \".notdef\" and \"space\"
    characters. On the Mac a couple additional characters are required: \"CR\" and
    \"NULL\". Note that FontLab Studio will generate these characters only if they
    do not exist in the font, so you can create them manually and control their appearance.
    We recommend leaving this option on, especially if you are developing Macintosh
    fonts.\"\r\n\r\nSo that clears that question up. Thanks a bunch.\r\n\r\nConcerning
    classes, I agree that it is largely a matter of preference, and I would probably
    use the first example myself, but would still like to hear everyone's preferences
    and particular techniques; you never know what you may pick up from a casual comment.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    clarification on Karsten's <em>\"automatically 'merge' classes\"</em> comment

    treatment of i-accent characters) is something I probably would have never thought
    of.\r\n\r\n@Mike Jarboe (et al.): So you generally keep your 'left' and 'right'
    shape classes separated? What about when you get overlapping content? Do you just
    accept the redundancy in the code and keep the shape classes separated, or do
    you keep them separate during production and then go back and 'merge' the identical
    content into the same class?\r\n\r\nThat's basically the heart of my inquiry;
    In order to keep the code as quick and clean as possible, is it acceptable to
    have redundancy in the [left/right] classes, or should the classes with identical
    content be merged whenever possible? (And is that a 'feature' in FLS5?)\r\n\r\nI
    tend to be excessively fastidious with my coding, so I may be sweating about nothing
    here. I just always look for the most efficient way to craft my code (efficient
    for the parser that is), even if it means a lot more work on my part.\r\n\r\nI
    also know that every typeface is treated differently, so I'm basically talking
    generalities, but any information is welcome.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n-Duncan\r\n"

    It sounds like extra work. I try to plan out the best strategy for the kerning
    classes (usually based on identical or closely similar shapes) before I start
    kerning and then stick with it. The classes depend a lot on the genre of the type
    design.\r\n\r\n(That said, I've been using Metrics Machine to do the kerning in
    my more recent designs. In that program, there are only left and right groups

    completely agree. This is why, in my post which you cite, I wrote:\r\n<cite>...
    and upon generating fonts I automatically 'merge' classes with identical content
    into a single class.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe important part is \"upon generating fonts\".
    Merging happens outside of the vfb and will leave the vfb's original leftside
    and rightside classes intact.\r\nIt is not a feature of FLS5 but part of my own
    font generation method/automatism. When doing Litteratra which has a lot of kerning
    and classes I noticed that AFDKO would produce a slightly smaller GPOS table if
    classes are merged. I should test this again with newer versions of AFDKO. Most
    of the time merging is mere cosmetics and not worth the effort.\r\n\r\nSo if you
    keep leftside and rightside classes separate this is fine and makes it easier
    to extend the glyph set later. In so far, as Mr Simonson said.\r\n\r\n    * *
    *\r\n\r\nAs to the first four glyphs, the spec recommends them <em>only</em> for
    TT-OTFs (i.e. OTFs with TT-outlines, in a 'glyf' table), not for CFF-OTFs (or
    PS-OTFs in Adam's terminology, i.e. OTFs with PS-outlines, in a 'CFF' table).
    Adobe's fonts are CFF-OTFs, so they are not affected by the recommendation.\r\nWith
    CFF-OTFs, the first glyph is expected to be '.notdef', usually followed by 'space'.\r\n\r\nIf
    you make TT-OTFs, it may be better to add the first four glyphs manually rather
    than relying on FLS5. Then you have a chance to adjust their widths. Advance width
    of 'CR' usually is the same as with 'space'; '.null'/'NUL' has an advance width
    of 0; and advance width of '.notdef' is up to you.\r\n\r\nBest wishes, Karsten"

    I can group all of my Es in to one for being on the right side, then drag them
    to be with the class \"_BDEFHIKLNPR_R\" to kern all of them the same, because
    the left side is exactly the same on all of these letters in my design. By keeping
    the individual classes too, I can always just go back if there are instances that
