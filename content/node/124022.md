  body: "Strokes thicker at the top than the bottom (top heavy tapered strokes) are
    a 1920s fashion for lettering.\r\nRudolph Koch and then Morris Benton did some
    fonts in this style. For example Morris Benton\u2019s 1928 ATF Paramount, which
    is included with Jim Spiece's series of Rudolph Koch's Eva (Locarno) designs.
    Here it as as Eva Paramount [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EvaParamountAsMahe_5263.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/eva-sg/\r\nIgnore the serifs and the
    similarities of concept are similar.\r\nAnd for a very sharp version of the idea
    check this old poster for the film Metropolis \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MetropolisPosterSM_4649.jpg]\r\nwhich
    is the inspiration for a font called Metropolis [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MetropolisSharp_6212.jpg]
    by Alphabet and Type http://www.alphabetype.it/metropolis_font.html\r\nWith some
    digging it should be possible to locate a rounded hand drawn sans with this thick
    top style.\r\nDon"
