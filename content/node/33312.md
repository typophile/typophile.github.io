  at London College of Communication. Being Welsh, I'm keen to explore my national
  identity with visible words, type and language. \r\n\r\nMy field of study is Typography,
  Welsh National Identity and  Culture. And the questions I'm exploring are: \r\n1)
  Can typography enhance national and cultural identity? \r\n2) Can a typeface communicate
  the special character of a national  identity? \r\n3) Can typography reflect the
  richness of the way we speak, through  accent, gender, age, speed, rhythm and geography
  in order to  preserve meaning and identity? \r\n4) How does a personal identity
  get constructed and reflected  through typography and graphics? \r\n5) Could a typeface
  be engineered with sense-of-place somehow sewn in? \r\n\r\nI noticed there was a
  discussion David Earls posted some time ago about the lettering on the front of
  the Millenium Centre building in Cardiff, and I'd very much like to talk to him
  further about this.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else has some thoughts/adivse on my field of
  study, Id appreciate it also!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSiaron"

    body: "Hi David, Im so pleased to get hold of you. I dont think I remember receiving
      your email.\r\n\r\nI'd be really interested to talk to you more about the lettering
      on the Millenium Centre/David Jones/and Welsh typography. I've also been in
      touch with John Hudson who's been really great. He sent me a link to the Gododdin
      the other month, which sent me on a quest to the British Museum to meet a Prof
      of Illuminated Manuscripts to try and understand more abouc what we term \"Celtic\"
      lettering.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have a chat with you? Im attempting
      to make a typeface for the Welsh language at the moment, something I've never
      done before.\r\n\r\nAny advise/comments would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSiaron"
