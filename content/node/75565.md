  signage etc.).\r\nAt first sight I think to Helvetica black o Gotham but I appreciate
  your suggestions, also if you suggest any reading about this matter (readability
  of sideways layout) because I have no relevant books or articles in my library."

    Frutiger (and Hans-J\xFCrg Hunziker, who executed the drawings) did some interesting
    work in this field when designing the \xABAlphabet Centre Pompidou\xBB, which
    was exactly intended to be set vertically for signage; the optical corrections
    (like making verticals very slightly thicker than horizontals) would be applied
    correctly for setting at *90 degrees*, so technically the \xABwrong\xBB way round
    if you look at the type horizontally (but it's really very subtle). This is mentioned
    (though frustratingly briefly) in <em>Frutiger: Typefaces. The Complete Works,</em>
    pp. 248/249 (for the German edition, not sure if it's on the same pages in the
    English one)."

    who drew that but also lots of other stuff."
