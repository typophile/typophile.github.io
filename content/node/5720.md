    target="_blank">Futura Condensed Extra Bold</a>, but they altered the M. It&#39;s
    also been condensed slightly.

  body: Thanks for the quick reply. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right, it does look like Futura
    Condensed Extra Bold, however, the M isn&#39;t just condensed, it doesn&#39;t
    have sloping sides.  The Marvel M is straight-sided. <BR> <BR>Are you sure? <BR>
