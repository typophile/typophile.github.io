  I just bought a used G4 tower and I am looking for a used copy of Fontographer 3.5
  or similar vintage.  Specifically, I need to be able to convert font data to postscript
  absolute for the purposes of US Copyright filings. I  am not looking for a favor
  and will pay market value.  Warmest regards, <BR> <BR>Frank Martinez'

    on the omnipresent closing caveat &#34;but I&#39;m not a lawyer&#34; in the Typophile
    archives you&#39;ll see how badly we need you around! Of course you should get
    paid for &#34;formal&#34; legal advice, but if you could chime in now and again

  body: Let me also put in another plug for <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">FontForge</a>,
    a free software font editor which is also quite useful for converting font formats
    and related tasks. There are packages for Mac OSX. You&#39;ll probably need the
    Apple X11 server to run it, but that really isn&#39;t any more hassle than running
    a program in Classic. <BR> <BR>Oh, and welcome to typophile! You may not realize
    what a can of worms you have opened with your offer to help on legal questions

  body: In the spirit of making solid files and remaing current most <BR>people here
    would suggest FontLab. It&#39;s all I use but... <BR> <BR>Three years ago in a
    last ditch effort to stick with FOG I found <BR>Fontographer 3.5 and FontStudio
    2 on Ebay for a mere $4.95 <BR>each. After placing my bid I recieved a call from
    a software <BR>clearence place in Californing asking if actually wanted this <BR>stuff
    as it was still on floppies. Of course! So a week later <BR>they arrived stil
    in the box. Both work on OS9 and I ended <BR>up paying something like $15 total
    with shipping. I never use <BR>them though. Kind of like collector automobiles
    for the poor.

  body: Frank, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve located a spare Fog 4.1 for Mac if you want it, but
    I only have one copy of 3.5 for Mac &#40;in a classy black and gold AltSys box&#41;.
    If you have no luck locating a used copy I&#39;d be happy to loan it to you, on
    the condition that you send it back if we ever need it.
