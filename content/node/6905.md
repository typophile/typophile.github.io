  conditioner worked after all, and it wasn&#39;t so hard to apply. Thanks William.
  In more good news: to save myself from having to apply <i>three</i> coats on this
  darn thing I got a stain-varnish combo deal, and it&#39;s great. The bad news? It
  doesn&#39;t look like this will have any typographic angle to it at all... :-/  Sorry.
