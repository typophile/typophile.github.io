    about CorelDraw as I have never worked with it.

    very useful.  it will create a bunch of layers/shapes.\r\nplay around with the
    settings to see what you want.  often times, i find it the best solution when
    needing to do something like this.  then you can import into illustrator or corel
    draw and save as to a different file format."

  body: Then you'll just have tell your client that not all the "effects" of the original
    could be captured because of the file format they chose and simplify your Illustrator
    artwork (don't use any of the effects, blending modes, or opacity).
