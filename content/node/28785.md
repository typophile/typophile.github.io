  body: From a quick glance, Baskerville that's been somehow abused?

  body: The closest fonts I've found so far are Goudy Old Style, Hoefler Text, and
    Palatino... but none of them are quite right. Still looking...

  body: You're right, it's not Baskerville. It's Red Rooster's Century New Style Medium.
    Looks like the teardrop on <em>J</em> is swallowed by the bottom white bar.

  body: Red Rooster's Century New Style Medium is about the closest I've seen, but
    the <em>a</em> looks a little different, and I'm still not sure the <em>J</em>
    has the teardrop. We may just have to use Century New Style Medium in place of
    the old font, if we can't get it exactly right. Thanks!
