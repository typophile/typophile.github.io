  body: The font is <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=206446"
    target="_blank">Estro</a>. Image Club had it in their collection, but this is
    the Mecanorma version at Agfa that I have linked. URW also has a version at MyFonts.
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately T-26 also has a font with this name, but it is quite different.

  body: Mike, I think the above sample is similar to Estro, but it&#39;s not the same
    face. Specifically, the serifs and the consistency of the stroke weights are quite
    different. I&#39;m thinking this is a freeware Estro-inspired knockoff. <BR> <BR><img

  body: My thought was that it had possibly been outlined in the same color as the
    background, making it look &#39;slimmer&#39;.  Did you see if the Mecanorma Estro
    is identical to the one from Image Club? &#40;I have them both, but I don&#39;t
    have time right now.&#41;

    a possibility, but it looks to me that many of the characters are simply a different
    shape. Compare the bowls and curves of the lowercase &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; <i>Did you see if the Mecanorma Estro is identical to the one from

    isn&#39;t possible. Other than perhaps the extent of the character set &#40;there
    weren&#39;t any ligatures in the Image Club version, for example...&#41; the two
    faces are nearly identical.'
