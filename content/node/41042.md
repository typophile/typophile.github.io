  be used for body copy or even headlines. Any recommendations?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    - but never knew where they were from.\r\n\r\nP22 is an excellent choice, so many
    good scripts.\r\n\r\nI thought I'd throw in Ovidius. Whenever I have a project
    that calls for \"historical\" (though sometimes more like hysterical) I lean toward
    the Demibold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/ovidius/\r\n\r\nJust a thought...."
