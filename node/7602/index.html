  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, <BR> <BR>As a recent graduate I would like to ask for some advice with my first piece of work please. <BR> <BR>Could anyone recommend a typeface suitable for information text panels within a local museum/gallery space? The brief states I must use &quot;Arial&quot;. I really don't want to mainly because I don't feel it is appropriate for the gallery content (18th century photography)I would like to use a serif, but I'm sure there are other suitable sans serif faces I could suggest?  <BR> <BR>Maybe this is the norm, and maybe I should use this typeface but I would prefer to argue the case for another.  <BR> <BR>The gallery is very conscious of legibility issues which I feel is right, but leaves me unsure about the legibilty of other typefaces due to my lack of experience in the field. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions or is my question a little vague? <BR> <BR>Thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Photography was invented in the early 19th century, by means of simultaneous developments among a number of researchers (Daguerre, Herschel, Niepce, Talbot) who were all exploiting Schulze's 1727 discovery of silver nitrate darkening on exposure to light. <BR> <BR>The French government considered the invention so important that they bought Niepce and Daguerre's patent(s) and put them in the public domain. <BR> <BR>The first book containing photos was Talbot's &quot;The Pencil of Nature&quot; (1846). <BR> <BR>Many further big technical breakthroughs in portability didn't come until the early 20th century. Portable flash photography (developed in large part by my great-grandfather, George R Lawrence); the 35mm camera in 1925 (Barnack) was another huge advance in portability; and then faster films made it possible to do away with the flash altogether. Then you got color, and the Polaroid, all before 1950. <BR> <BR>Any museum/gallery using Arial for exhibit labels didn't have a decent typographer involved in their development. I'd agree with most of the above suggestions, except that stuff like Bulmer and Walbaum is probably not best for readability under sub-optimal conditions (which exhibits usually are, in my experience). <BR> <BR>Personally, I'd go with a good humanist sans serif, if the client is hung up on sans serifs. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the info, really helpful. <BR> <BR>Perhaps I should first clear something up, I wasn't really very clear in my first post. I was refering to various artists who had photographed /illustrated 18th century culture for the exhibition, I didn't mean to say that it was photography from the 18th century. Wasn't very clear sorry. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I have been looking at using a serif for the header text and a sans serif for the body text. Most books I have been reading through, (mostly page layout) recommend the opposite. Would I be making a mistake attempting this?  <BR> <BR>Anyway I will experiment with your suggestions and see how it sits with a Serif header. Something with small, subtle serifs? I originally wanted something from the 18th century, but now I am searching further a field, after little success. <BR> <BR>Thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I'd avoid sans if you can. I think it'd seem a bit incongruous. And, if the museum uses Arial (unwisely) everywhere else, the sans's character will pop more in that context. Also, if the focus is 18th century culture, I'd go with something period-specific that seems, to the average viewer, more related. <BR> <BR>geraint, is Caslon's Egyptian for sale on Font Bureau's site? I can't find it. <BR> <BR>I'd recommend Kent Lew's <a href="http://kentlew.com/Type.html">Whitman</a>, for a variety of non-historical reasons, but it doesn't have a bold italic, which I imagine you'd need in a museum setting.
