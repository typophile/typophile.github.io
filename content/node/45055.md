  body: "No, I find \"Sch_ei&szlig;e\" funny too!\r\n\r\nIt looks quite slick and
    it is Arial, but since Arial necessarily trades on the Helveitca aesthetic it
    all looks rather Helvetican to me.\r\n\r\nBranding a school is an odd concept
    too!"

  body: " I have a 5-year-old daughter that only gets to see Comic Sans and 'child-like-handwriting'
    type in her school surroundings.\r\nAnd her school is \"branded\" too... I guess
    you are referring to an able designer getting the job that normally someone's
    cousin (at least here in Spain) usually would \"handle.\" I'd think her school
    would rock if it had anything as cool as this in the corridors.\r\n\r\nI like
    the idea that the children will be able to produce their own branded items straight
    out of their old PC's. And they may even get to think about tracking/kerning when
    trying to emulate the items they've seen on the walls?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Branding is...  Well, cattle get branded. it kind of creeps me out to see
    to too slick a branding job on a school...  Although this one is nicely executed,
    subtle and not so in-your-face. \r\n\r\nAll schools <em>I've</em> ever seen are
    branded. Some (a few) professionally. Some by students, some by school board members'
    cousins. Often team mascots are involved. (go team go!)\r\n\r\nI think I prefer
    the variety where the kids have had some input. \r\n\r\nThe fact that it is Arial
    just goes to show we can all get a little too bent out of shape over typefaces.
    Sure I hate Arial, but like any other typeface, it has a purpose and can be used
    effectively. (Besides, every typeface is somebody's baby... )\r\n\r\n.-=\xAE=-"
