		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have to admit this made me laugh. I would tell her with a high degree of confidence that an absolute no-hyphenation rule would be seen as extreme by typographic experts. There are many books with a variety of closely related by no means identical suggestions about how to handle when &amp; how to hyphenate. What is seen as the desirable sweet spot is something that has moved over time. Still, why not show her two or three? Maybe you can agree to something if she has some postive examples to look at rather than just an idea to cling to. Also, to my (admittedly non-encyclopedic) knowlege there are no major publications use that rule either.</p>
<p>This said, I personally think rag fear is overstated. I like a left aligned text with a light rag very much. But this sort of thing enters the realm of taste. Without seeing a sample it really is hard to say what I think. What do you mean by &lsquo;fairly short&rsquo; BTW?</p>
<p>What do my fellow typophiles think? Could any case whatever be made for an absolutely unhyphenated treatement? In either Justified or Unjustified mode?</p>
<p>Wait! I just though of one situation in which such a rule might make sense: A children&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re a college student. Your client probably thinks that she knows more than you, and regardless of whether or not she does, she&rsquo;s probably not going to change her mind for you. So just be happy that you&rsquo;re in college and you can actually find paid freelance work; here in DC the only students I know getting freelance work are either doing it for free or for so little money that they&rsquo;re probably spending more running comps on their own inkjet printers than they&rsquo;re making on the jobs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t look to newspapers for elegant typesetting, I have seem some pretty appalling rivers, loose lines and widows even in the paper of record (the NY Times). Setting justified type in a narrow column does create problems - but so does ragging and in a multi-column design like most papers rag right could get ugly. I notice they use rag more for opinion pieces, reviews, commentary rather than reporting.</p>
<p>I have noticed a bias on this site against justified type which I don&rsquo;t think is quite fair - in many instances it is easier to read and cleaner than rag. I am leary of anybody - designer, teacher or client - who establishes absolute &ldquo;rules&rdquo; to govern design. The only rule should be what works best for that particular job, given its content, purpose, constraints.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a student, you will learn as you continue to work that you need to pick your battles. Some things are worth going to the mat for, others not. Which is not to say that you shouldn&rsquo;t want each job to look as good as it can. But not every job will end up in your portfolio and maybe your time is better spent looking for new clients than arguing hyphenation with the one you already have. Sometimes a client just wants to piss on a job too, and you have to let them. They feel like they aren&rsquo;t getting their money&rsquo;s worth if they don&rsquo;t put you thru your paces. Decide what you can and will concede and what you will fight for.</p>

<p>Setting in narrow columns causes problems whatever rule you follow with respect to line endings. My point in citing newspaper practice is just to indicate that the burden of proof, given the overwhelming practice to the contrary, is on those who claim that justified text is inherently inferior. I could have cited also almost all extended text in books&ndash;which with the wider measures is easier to set well.</p>
<p>The perfectly even word spacing you can get by rags is a definite plus, but I agree with you that this advantage is often outweighed by the advantages of justified type.</p>

<p>Justified type gives a cleaner, more formal appearance. It looks better under centered heads. Ragged type is more friendly. To a student my advice is to try both where applicable and learn how they work for you. They can both be used in the same job: for example in book design I&rsquo;ll often justify the main text and use ragged for sidebars or captions to set them apart.</p>

Since the problem with not hyphenating arrises when long words are used in narrow column widths, you may see if she would be willing to opt for a shorter word in place of one that creates a large gap in the rag. That is of course if the rag is worth it to her. It is hard to imagine that
if she is so bothered by a hyphen, she wouldn&rsquo;t notice a really awkwardly shaped column created by a bad rag.</div>

She just thinks that a hyphenation is more unsightly than a rough rag.
I agree. 
Evenness of word-spacing is not the only reason for ragging &ndash; it also does away with hyphenation, and consequently any ragged copy that still has hyphenation looks wrong.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. Personally I feel that hyphenation is much more of a disruption to reading than is slightly varying word space from line to line. So now I will pay attention to the difference between rag right without hyphenation vs justified with hyphenation, and see if it changes my ideas about this.</p>
<p>Still, I think other variables&ndash;like measure and leading&ndash;have a bigger impact.</p>

The variables are immense but in the end it boils down to familiarity with the reader. Who&rsquo;s reading it and are they used to hyphens, does the hyphen read confortably with the audience? of course it does. It&rsquo;s everywhere and anywhere. Use it with the satisfaction of knowing that it will not hinder leagibility. What does become problamatic is extreme short lines with less than 30 characters, under 50 is scary in itself.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, hyphens are removed when the copy is short, sweet and for advertising purposes only&hellip; a quick scan read if you must. ( outdoor, posters, magazine ads, etc) but when it comes to brochures or copy in which the audience will be dwelving into an informatic zone than I hyphen  it!</p>

<p>To my students interested in this subject I always recommend two nice pieces by John Berry, written for creativepro.com: <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/8656.html" target="_blank"><em>The Justification for Hyphenation</em></a> and <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/8868.html?origin=story" target="_blank"><em>The Hyphenation of Justification</em></a>. Read them, they are pretty good. And try to make your client read them. Of course, I am not sure that reading those short essays could change her mind, but it never hurts to try, no?</p>
<p>My own take on this issue is fairly simple: hyphenation is beneficial for the readability of the body text (justified <em>and</em> FLRR), and a no-no in display typography.</p>

<p>I tried to say that hypentated nouns, verbs, and adverbs (generally long words) are not disruptive when reading because they are easily predicted using syntactic information.</p>
<p>On the other hand pronouns, conjunctions or prepositions (mostly short words) can be more disruptive when reading if they are found at the end of a line because the sense of the text breaks.</p>
<p>Short words at the end of the lines tend to appear much more in hard rags because of the attitude commonly assumed when setting them, mostly if you think that a rag doesn&rsquo;t need to be tuned.</p>
<p>One of the most annoying things for me is to find a short word of the aforementioned kind at the end of a long line.</p>

<p>It is impossible to change a client’s mind on something like this. Don’t try.</p>

<p>I do not agree that. As graphic designer we&rsquo;ve to educate client or anybody else. Sometime it&rsquo;s nice to do a job without hyphenation and sometime it&rsquo;s not. At my opinion, the client pay for our knowledge, so he has to have confident in our hyphenation suggestion. Personally I do not accept the client come over my shoulder to direct my graphic design choice.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to compromise what you&rsquo;ve been taught in order to try to make a customer&rsquo;s idea happen. Even when you know what the customer is asking for will not work, you have to show it- where your talents come in is making it look good. It&rsquo;s not always easy. That&rsquo;s just how it is sometimes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that if that sort of thing became standard in English, readers would take it in stride. After all, the convention of spaces between words doesn&rsquo;t bear much relationship to where people actually break words when they&rsquo;re talking.</p>

The non-hyphenation seems perfectly logical and at home, as you&rsquo;re getting a &ldquo;rough&rdquo; rag anyway from the short one-line entries, and because many entries are two- or three-line paragraphs that end in short lines.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, have you considered incorporating true italics and small caps?

<p>I typeset the book in TeX Computer Modern, which includes true small caps, slanted, and italic. I used italic for things like titles of books and movies, and slanted for things like the comments at the top of some of the pages, also for names of pathogens such as Cryptosporidium parvum.

<p>I was looking at the country abbreviations, where the small caps are set at a smaller size than the adjacent roman, and jumped to the conclusion that because they are thinner, they&rsquo;re faux. My mistake.</p>
<p>I note that you are using a double-f ligature, a very proper typographic nicety. If there&rsquo;s one thing that looks out of place &ndash; even though with a specific hierarchical meaning &ndash; it&rsquo;s the slanted roman. However, not an issue with your readers.</p>
