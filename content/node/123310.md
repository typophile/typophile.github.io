  body: "At least some are William Page Chromatic [multicolor] fonts dating from around
    the 1860s and 1870s.\r\nAs Nick says, these were usually identified by number.
    However, in later years some were given names, particularly when metal type versions
    were released.\r\nSome of these might match your mystery fonts https://www.myfonts.com/person/William_Hamilton_Page/\r\nDon"
