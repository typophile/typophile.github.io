  body: Looks a little like 'Bookman Old Style' with some slight alterations to the
    serifs, especially on the "L" and "T".

  body: "It may have been patterned after a typeface, but as handmade letters anything
    could have been altered for practical (manufacturing) reasons. I doubt Bookman
    was the model, because the T shape is way off, and except for the R the other
    letters are rather generic (come to think of it the R is pretty generic, the way
    most people would make one, I'd say). \r\n\r\nI think your guess is as good as
    anyone's, since no font was involved, technically speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "To give you an idea about what I mean, there are at least 995 serif fonts
    (per my [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif Guide]])
    with an R with the leg coming from the bowl like this one. A certain percentage
    of them have a half serif on the leg. (There were five fonts with a similar R
    between Aalborg and Agora (14 listed fonts to that point), to give specifics.
    At that rate there could be 200 fonts or more with a similar R.)\r\n\r\nEspecially
    without other letters, and some assurance that these weren't made-up letters,
    it seems problematic to search for an ID.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
