  (or similar dingbat) reminiscent of something you'd expect plastered all over the
  studio of a 70s game show in shades of orange, yellow and avocado. Here's something
  along the right lines:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni-asterisk_4614.png]\r\n...but
  I'm hoping for something geometrically stronger. I realize that's not entirely in
  keeping with my 70s game show description ... think of it as a modern remake of
  a 70s game show."

  body: The asterisk I posted was a Bodoni, and I prefer the curves of it to Caslon.
    I'm hoping for something that makes a stonger impression, perhaps with curved
    spokes (arms? tentacles?) that balloon out into geometrically circular ends (but
    not circles on sticks)...

  body: A belated thanks! That works well. If anyone has any other suggestions, please
    give 'em. Also, I'm looking for a diamond with slightly concave sides ... I think
    I'm getting more into dingbat territory.
