    Gothic Extended #2 (or something like that). Its a trade gothic. ;)\r\n\r\nThe
    first three are Copperplate Gothic."

    3, however -- after being directed to Trade Gothic for sample 4, I found one that
    looks like it might be a match (to my admittedly unpracticed eye):\r\n\r\nTrade

  body: Last two could also be Sackers Gothic, but I suspect they are all Copperplate
    and the lack of serifs is just spread in the printing.

  body: I'm not going to agree that the latter is a Copperplate. There is just no
    evidence of serifs. That, and it is very close to a Trade Gothic (or sackers Gothic)
