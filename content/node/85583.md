  one font. But I've got the bold, italic, roman and small caps version. When I activate
  the font and select it in InDesign. InDesign shows only the Dolly Roman version
  as option, but it uses Dolly Bold.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me, please?\r\n\r\n\r\nBUROBRAAF/\r\nRobbert

  body: "My suggestion could be the fix.\r\n\r\nBTW You can take it out of that folder
    after usage : )\r\n\r\nRe using Suitcase or any other font manager: that\u2019s
    just for ease and comfort, but these apps can be picky and have problems with
    certain fonts."

  body: "These are issues that you should probably take up with either Extensis (Suitcase
    not handling PST1 fonts properly) or with Underware (Dolly fonts not name-linked
    properly).\r\n\r\nOr, the other possibility is that InDesign has a corrupted font
    cache. \r\n\r\nThe first thing to try in order to isolate the culprit would be
    to see if Dolly behaves this way in any non-Adobe software. Trying it in TextEdit
    is usually a good neutral choice. Testing in Word is often another way to distinguish
    an Adobe problem from a broader system-wide issue.\r\n\r\nIf Dolly behaves well
    in non-Adobe software, then it is a problem with InDesign. Delete your Adobe font
    caches (and restart for good measure).\r\n\r\nIf Dolly still shows the same mixed
    up problem, then take it out of Suitcase and put it in one of the system font
    folders. If it no longer shows problems in non-Adobe software, then the problem
    is with Suitcase\u2019s handling of the fonts. Contact Extensis.\r\n\r\nIf the
    problem persists when Dolly is loaded via one of the system font folders, then
    the problem is probably with the fonts themselves. Contact Underware."

  body: "Problem solved.\r\n\r\nI've got now 3 folders in suitcase with the name Dolly.\r\nEvery
    folder contains: \r\n\u2022Dolly-Bold\r\n\u2022Dolly-Italic\r\n\u2022Dolly-Roman\r\n\u2022Dolly-Smallcaps\r\n\r\nThe
    difference?\r\nThe first folder contains TTF files\r\nThe second folder contains
    OTF files\r\nThe Third folder contains Postscript files\r\n\r\nOnly the last folder
    works. TTF or OTF gives both the same problem."

  body: "Then the issue was probably due to problems in the name fields. \r\n\r\nI
    didn\u2019t think that Underware provided formats other than the original Postscript
    Type 1. If the TTF and OTF were not generated by Underware from original sources,
    then I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the name fields got mucked by the translators."
