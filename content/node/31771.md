  reading? And how long is the code for the carrier? \r\n\r\nI am with Orange, so
  do I split it like this (no, this is not a real number):\r\n\r\n<strong>0781 61
  11 111</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>or</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>07816 11 11 11</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>or</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>?</strong>\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    me flows easier to read ( British mobile phone user :) ) But of course just my
    opinion ;)\r\n\r\nKarl"

  body: "You're right, there are rarely hard rules when it comes to making information
    easy to read, but there are basic rules about which part of a phone number is
    'area code' and which part is 'subscriber number'.\r\nA London number has a three-digit
    area code and an eight-digit subscriber number.\r\nMost towns have a four or five-digit
    area code and a six or seven-digit subscriber number.\r\nSome small towns have
    a six-digit area code and only a four-digit subscriber number.\r\n\r\nNothing
    like keeping it simple ...\r\n\r\nAs long as you keep your UK mobile phone 'area
    code' together (07816 or 7816 for international), it wouldn't really matter how
    you arrange the subscriber number;\r\nxx xx xx would suit some numbers more than
    the more usual xxx xxx.\r\n\r\nit may have been a typo in your post but you only
    need one '+' to denote an international number"

  body: "From the Ofcom Telephone Numbering Plan (via that Wikipedia link above):\r\n\"It
    is very common to see the + notation being misused \u2014 +44 (0)xxx xxx xxxx
    is not an uncommon occurrence even in official documents. For international callers
    the number between the brackets is dropped. For callers within the United Kingdom
    the +44 is dropped and the number between the brackets used. Calling +44 0xxx
    xxx xxxx will not work from most operators, and the +44 (0)xxx notation is incorrect
    and should not be used. The correct usage of the + notation in this example of
    the three-digit geographic code is +44 xxx xxx xxxx.\"\r\n\r\nAs more people start
    to use mobile phones as their primary telephone, it makes sense to use the correct
    international number \u2013 no (0) \u2013 so that you can dial it from anywhere
    in the world without having to add or remove digits. If you dial +447816111111
    on a mobile phone it will work in the UK as well as globally.\r\n\r\nI noticed
    that some pages on the Ofcom site \u2013 including the contact page of the Welsh
    language version \u2013 use the numbering scheme: (+44) (0)20 7981 3033 so it's
    clear that these are only guidelines and even the regulators can't stick to them.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think it really matters if you prefer to use the (0) but I was glad to read
    that it is unnecessary as I always found it cluttered and a little ugly.\r\n\r\nMore
    information here:\r\nhttp://paulm.com/how_to/write_a_phone_number.html\r\n\r\nMy
    initial comment\r\n<cite> but not\r\n+44 (0)7816 111 111</cite>\r\n\r\nwas really
    in response to maxack's request for the 'correct' way. I was working on the assumption
    that it's good to know the rules so that you can break them well ...\r\n\r\n\r\n(sorry
    for the rambling essay, I need a cup of tea) "

    their Paris office number, Barclays numbers on that page are only for international
    use, and the FOE shows both 020 and +44 20 forms of their main number.\r\n\r\nI
    suspect for the moment at least, the man in the street is likely to be confused
    by a UK number in the +44 (0)x format and even more by +44 x. Not everyone makes
    international calls. "

  body: "How are my citations \"dubious\" ... the links I gave were specifically to
    illustrate <em>international</em> standards for <em>UK</em> numbers. So, for all
    the reasons you point out, those links were good examples of that. The fact that
    some sites used different standards for national calls is probably to avoid the
    confusion you mention in you post* and the phone numbers for other countries may
    follow the numbering conventions specific to each country.\r\n\r\nThose were not
    links in an attempt to prove that \"I'm right\", just links for Tim if he felt
    like he needed examples to back up his designs for a specific client.\r\n\r\nI
    have no agenda here. I am happy to concede that the most common way to format
    international numbers in the UK is +44 (0)... but I was only pointing out that
    while the (0) is a convention, it is not necessarily correct.\r\n\r\n*I chose
    the FOE link precisley because it used both +44 20 and 020 numbering. The aim
    of contact details are usually to make the information clear and easy to understand;
    sometimes dual numbers for local and international customers is easier to understand
    than one hybrid number that is correct for neither.\r\n\r\nCrumbs! I feel like
    I am on the defensive about telephone number formats ... I am (thankfully?) not
    an expert, I was only trying to help.\r\n\r\nI'll get my coat.\r\n"

  body: One alternate way to write this would be +44 (7816) 111111. While not so useful
    for mobile numbers, it becomes useful when using geographical (+441XXX_, +442X_)
    numbers in some applications like Microsoft Outlook. I specify the national access
    code as '0' and the international code as '00' (so area codes should be, for example,
    '121' and not '0121'). This method makes it crystal clear the international, national
    and local parts of the number.
