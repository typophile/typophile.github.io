  Evolette A Light</a> which is supposed to contain 2 different sets of stylistic
  alternatives, but when I go to find these in the OpenType menu they are greyed out
  with only the options of Ordinals and Fractions. \r\n\r\nAny idea why?"

    support in applications</a> (where I simply got by following the links on the
    page you provided), Photoshop CS5 does not support Stylistic Sets 1-20.\r\n\r\nJust
    checked: Stylistic Set 1-20 don't appear as a selectable option in P'shop either,
    grayed or not, but they <em>do</em> in InDesign."

    Adobe forums quite often. Even a simple Glyphs panel would allow you to access
    all alternates ... Walk down the street to <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform\">Adobe's
    Feature Request Form</a> and add your voice to the choir, I'd say."

  body: "hello,\r\n\r\nthe <em>stylistics set 01</em> and <em>stylistics set 02</em>
    to get access to the alternate letters do only work in InDesign.\r\nBut we added
    the features <em>stylistics alternates</em> and <em>titling alternates</em> to
    get acces to the alternate letters even in Photoshop and Illustrator.\r\n\r\n->
    have may have a look at http://26plus-zeichen.de/wp-content/uploads/TJ-EvoletteA_how-to-use.pdf

    you have bought the font right after its release \u2013 we updatetd the features
    for photoshop a little later than the fonts first release (cause \"titling alternates\"
    is a kind of work-around which is not the \"true\" usage for a stylistic set)\r\n->
    if you have still the old version, just send us all your weights at tj{at}26plus-zeichen.de
    and we'll reply with the newer font-files. (in that case, we do really feel sorry
    for the circumstances)"

  body: I downloaded it the day I posted this (5 days ago). I downloaded the free
    for personal use 1 weight file, but it says that it includes the different styles,
    but does it actually?

    really weird, caus you are useing the same photoshop-version as me and having
    the same font-file installed - but, as i see you do not have the sylsitics sets
    nore have any kering.\r\nif i would have your fontfile, i could solve the problem
    (wich i do not understand so far, because the light weight contais all sets nevertehless
    if you buy it as personal-free-font or as commercial font)"
