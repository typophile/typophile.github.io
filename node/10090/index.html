<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am a doctoral candiate at Hong-Ik university, Korea. My interest is a certain typographic composition which, assumably, started in the early twenties(1920's). But it is not easy to find some available references and even know of the accurate term for it. <br> <br>Belows are typical samples, which show the certain structure that use the same alphabet among two or more words. <br> <br>In fact I am in trouble because I am planning to set it as a thesis theme. My thesis is about some possibilty that this can be adapted to Korean Typography. It has not been considered because the Korean, Hangul structure is quie different from the English's. <br> <br>In the early stage of my thesis, the terminoloy and references about it is absolutely in need. It will be thankful if you give me even a simple comment on it. <br> <br>Bjornz Li <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/68650.jpg alt="sampes of the structure"></div>

<div class=commentbody>>assumably, started in the early twenties <br> <br>In a way. Crossword puzzles were a huge fad at that time, which is probably related. <br> <br>But actually, they go right back to ancient Rome: <br> <br>SATOR <br>AREPO <br>TENET <br>OPERA <br>ROTAS <br> <br>...and have a long cult history. <br> <br>I've recently seen an astonishing Christian "poster" from 1500(?) years ago which was composed of a massive grid-field of normal-reading text from which various significant diagonal and vertical phrases are highlighted in different colours. Unfortunately, I am not the world's best note-taker, so I can't give you any further information, other than it was in an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge about 4 months ago. <br> <br>There is also the traditional genre of "acrostic" verse, where the Initial character of each line, read vertically, spells out a message. <br> <br>Check out "The Oxford Book of Word Games" and Willard R. Espy, "An Almanac of Words at Play", to approach this phenomenon from the literary angle, which is, I believe, equally, if not more relevant than that of design.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you for your help. <br> <br>I guessed it can be considered as "crossword puzzle, word game, and word play". But I meant it was revealed in the 1920's in terms of typography(printed type). <br> <br>Now I am checking out more about your mentioned references. And I'd like you to suggest more relvant information in a typograhic way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thinking about it purely from a functional standpoint (rather than its uses in games), you might call it "intersecting typography." Though in the Cinzano ad you showed, there's an extra element: the fact that (in that typeface) what's an N on one axis is a Z on another. <br> <br>John Berry</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi John, welcome to Typophile. <br> <br>Bjorn, you might want to do a spot of research on Prof. Michael Twyman's 'Schema for graphic language', as I recall it covers every conceivable form of text layout. He did talk about it (most recently perhaps) at the 2002 Thessaloniki conference. <br> <br>Cheers, Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mistress of patterns and mean Scrabble player Marian Bantjes prepared this test setting of Restraint, a sort of nouveau Victorian display face that she designed in collaboration with Tiro partner Ross Mills.

<div class=commentbody>For those of you who missed my earlier post: <br> <br>Traditionally, going back centuries, the genre of characters doing double duty in horizontal and vertical words is known as "Acrostic", in poetry. <br> <br>Since the 1920s US puzzle craze, (still well established in one's daily paper), the common usage is "Crossword". <br> <br>No need to reinvent the wheel merely because some graphic designers "revealed" a "new" kind of layout; of the two "Crossword" seems to be the no-brainer.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi NIck, thank you again. <br> <br>I know that typography is closely linked with poetry, as Lissitzky's "About Two Square" was kind of a typographic interpretation of Russian Futurist poetry. <br> <br>In 1920's the notion of orthogonality was influential. So we can see it at the every(not some) other famous graphic work. Muller Brockman's work is typical case which spreaded Swiss international typographic style. <br> <br>I think that your "Acrostic " style has played a major role to maximize typographic vision without help of image. So it is ubiquitious. I am focusing that it is a typographic view/phenomenon/principle, not merely a word game for no brainer.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bjornz, I don't know if there is an existing term for the sorts of thing you show in your posted images. You might try the term typogramme, which has links to the para-typographical experiments described in Herbert Spencer's _The Liberated Page_ under the term 'calligramme' (Guillaume Apolinnaire) and 'id</div>

<div class=commentbody>>I am focusing that it is a typographic view/phenomenon/principle <br> <br>Yes, this is more apparent with your second set of illustrations, where the layouts are driven by Constructivism. <br> <br>>Did Lissitzky want to get the most out of "Acrostics" to make his monumental work? <br> <br>I suspect that the acrostic element was serendipitous, and followed from Lissiztky's adherence to his constructivist/suprematist principles. <br> <br>If he had set out to produce a constuctivist work with plastic elements composed purely of meaningful words running up, down, and diagonally, he must have been confronted with the problem of what to do at the intersection of perpendiculars: the acrostic would have strongly suggested itself to his receptive mind. <br> <br>BTW, I'm now liking "acrostic" more than "crossword": -- it sounds more intellectually impressive, ennit?</div>

It should be also manipulative, serendipitous in making it's samples with Korean. <br>Recently my friend showed me various sampes which ancient chinese poets did in the similar ways. It was gorgeous! As you might know, Chinese itself is very expressive and meaningful. <br> <br>Anyhow I'd like you to show some Korean samples someday.</div>
