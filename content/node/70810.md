body: "I'm designing a publication about Gender equality in Iceland for teenagers
  and young adults for the Ministry of Education and Culture. I'm having a debate
  how I should treat the endnotes in the document.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI much prefer
  having them close by where they can be easily found, and I do love having marginalia
  floating about to give life to the margin. But at the same time, most of them are
  book and internet references and a lot of them don't look so great. Bringhurst advises
  us to use sidenotes whenever possible, but here I'm not sure. But I feel that endnotes
  are more disruptive to the reading of a text and a bunch of them in the endmatter
  make it look kind of ugly.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?"

  body: I think sidenotes just work well for subtitles or captions. References works
    terribly with this format. And endnotes, although let the layout clean, are harder
    to read due to their distance to the main text. My choice would be footnotes.

  body: "I've always preferred footnotes at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nUnless
    URLs are short and memorable, they will not be used as links by print readers,
    so there is no practical reason to include alphanumeric gobbledegook. (I have
    come across research which had this as a finding, but can't remember where.)\r\n\r\nPeople
    will just google to find a website.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose clunky URLs could, indeed
    go in the back of the publication, where they will never be read, like legalese."

    intended audience?\r\n\r\n<cite>most of them are book and internet references
    and a lot of them don't look so great</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's something I really
    despise. \r\nThe best way would be to separate references from notes, in order
    to place the former in the back (as Nick said) and the latter either as sidenotes
    (my favourite as well) or footnotes."
