body: "Is it possible to do ligature substitutions right to left in OpenType?\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a special monospaced typeface with ligatures, you can check it out [[https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig/|here]].\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to separate zeros in groups of three with a ligature. Examples: 1000000 ->
  1 000 000, and 10000 -> 10 000. The substitution should be done right to left, or
  otherwise the 10000 becomes 1 000 0, as with the following code:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
  liga {\r\n    sub zero zero zero by zero_zero_zero;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI'd also
  appreciate information on how one would use kerning rules in a situation like this,
  though I'm not sure if they would apply to a monospaced typeface."

  body: "You can use contextual substitutions to replace a zero, or a digit, with
    a variant; for instance a digit followed by three digits but not a fourth can
    be replaced by a digit with a larger right side bearing. Knowing that lookups
    are applied on the input line one after the other, that gives the impression that
    the processing is right to left though it is not. Here is some code that I just
    checked in FontForge and that groups digits in groups of three.\r\n<PRE>\r\n@dgt
    \   = [\\zero \\one \\two \\three \\four \r\n          \\five \\six \\seven \\eight
    \\nine] ;\r\n@dgtrsp = [\\zero.rsp \\one.rsp \\two.rsp \\three.rsp \r\n          \\four.rsp
    \\five.rsp \\six.rsp \r\n          \\seven.rsp \\eight.rsp \\nine.rsp ] ; \r\n\r\nlookup
    addspace1 {\r\n   ignore sub @dgt' @dgt @dgt @dgt @dgt ; \r\n   sub @dgt' @dgt
    @dgt @dgt by @dgtrsp ;\r\n} addspace1 ;\r\n\r\nlookup addspace2 {\r\n\tsub @dgt'
    @dgt @dgt @dgtrsp by @dgtrsp ;\r\n} addspace2 ;\r\n\r\nlookup addspace3 {\r\n\tsub
    @dgt' @dgt @dgt @dgtrsp by @dgtrsp ;\r\n} addspace3 ;\r\n\r\nlookup addspace4
    {\r\n\tsub @dgt' @dgt @dgt @dgtrsp by @dgtrsp ;\r\n} addspace4 ;\r\n\r\nfeature
    calt {\r\n   script DFLT;\r\n     language dflt ;\r\n\tlookup addspace1 ;\r\n\tlookup
    addspace2 ;\r\n\tlookup addspace3 ;\r\n\tlookup addspace4 ;\r\n   script latn
    ;\r\n     language dflt;\r\n\tlookup addspace1 ;\r\n\tlookup addspace2 ;\r\n\tlookup
    addspace3 ;\r\n\tlookup addspace4 ;\r\n} calt ;\r\n</PRE>\r\nOf course, if you
    wanted to group digits after the decimal point, you would consider left contexts
    and use digits with a large left side bearing instead.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed above
    that the glyph zero.rsp is the glyph zero with a right side bearing increased
    by some constant value and similarly for other .rsp glyphs. It is also possible
    to keep all .rsp digits the same width as  digits and then to add a kerning equal
    to that constant value (for you, the character widths) between the .rsp digits
    and the digits; that has the same visual effect."
