    are two \"negatively-sidebearinged\" nut bars, one for single-digit denominators,
    and one for two-digit denominators. There is a class of numerator characters with
    extra sidebearing width, to centre over double-digit denominators. This system
    works perfectly for everything from 0/0 to 99/99, but only in InDesign!\r\n\r\nIn
    the same font, users can build slash fractions by selecting numerator and denominator
    features. (This is possible, because the nut fractions use the smaller superior
    and inferior figures). I have also included the basic fractions in the font, as
    composite characters, in the nut configuration.\r\n\r\nThe reason I put the nut
    fractions first is because they are appropriate to the style of the typeface (a
    scotch modern revival)."

    'frac' feature, is to NOT access pre-composed fractions (onehalf, onethird, etc.)
    via OpenType layout substitutions. The glyphs are included in the fonts (where
    applicable) and assigned Unicode values accordingly, but there is not reference
    to them in the features.\r\n\r\nOur goal for taking this approach is to preserve
    the character stream as it was input by the user, i.e. <strong>U+0031 U+002F U+0032</strong>
    (1/2) won't be replaced by <strong>U+00BD</strong> (&#x00BD;). This means that
    all fractions are by default arbitrary, and therefore the elements that compose
    them need to kerned as needed."

  body: "Your logic is impeccable as ever Adam, but given the scenario you describe,
    I think that the tendency would be towards word-free icons, as in the Illustrator
    OT menu. And I really do prefer words -- as I mentioned, I have never warmed to
    the OS X interface, and still rely on the pop-up words to distinguish InDesign
    from Photoshop in the \"Dock\". I am still confused between \"paragraph leading\"
    and \"paragraph indent\" in the InDesign menu, despite many years of almost daily
    use. \r\n\r\nWhat I would really like to see:\r\n\r\n* First, the Fraction features
    should be properly conceived, named as \"sfrc\" and \"nfrc\", not \"frac\" and
    \"afrc\". In other words, they should be Slash and Nut, not with a designation
    that assumes the Nut is the alternate. \r\n\r\n*Secondly, I'd like to see two
    options in the OT menu, Slash and Nut, with icons and pop-up names, as in Illustrator.
    \r\n\r\n*Thirdly, where a feature is absent from a font, no greyed-out or unchecked
    menu item, just nothing.\r\n\r\nEven if fonts don't have an arbitrary nut fraction
    feature, which is problematic to implement, it would still be feasible for foundries
    to include the basic fractions (halfs, quarters, eights and thirds) as composite
    glyphs, programmed to the \"nfrc\" feature.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the logic
    of standardization, I also find that typographically it makes too many assumptions
    about what the default feature should be. Why does every typeface have to have
    tabular lining figures as the default? Why does every typeface have to have slash
    fractions as the default? Why not two figure styles instead of one or four?\r\n\r\n"

    understand your question.\r\nFrom my perspective which currently is: use inline
    in a set text- I am working on fractions themselves that will consist of numbers
    approximate in design to (scaled down) lining Figures. These wouldn't naturally
    line up with Text Lining figures as shown above. If they were to do so, would
    make the nut fraction too small (surely [untested]). I know it would be difficult
    to beef up the small numbers to match the density of Lining Figures. [I would
    hope there is no need for nut fractions in Bold surly]\r\nThere lies the challenge.
    \r\n\r\nHowever this is exactly how the Liza Pro has them for table use... which
    I like the idea of.\r\nI have just seen in the User Guide PDF that the nut fractions
    extend both up (above the Cap height) and down (below the base line) by quite
    a bit, making them not so good for annual reports but great for 50s style advertising
    vernacular ephemera.\r\n\r\nI was thinking this is also the way (Nut-style) to
    have fractions for a titling alternative style.\r\n\r\n"
