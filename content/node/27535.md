  an idea that was bouncing around my sketch book for a while. Obviously, I am having
  a bit of trouble envisioning the \"Z\". Any thoughts? Any references which might
  get me over the hump?"

    Text</a>. You could start there.

    body: Thanks. That is very similar in feel. Perhaps i should push this in a different
      direction. Why reinvent the wheel? I'm thinking maybe making this a set of small
      caps, with a very large x-height. A set of coordinating dingbats might round
      out the font for poster usage. Should be done just in time for Halloween :)
