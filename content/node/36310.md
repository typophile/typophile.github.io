  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know any interesting story's about the making of this font and/or

  body: "Akzidenz Grotesk originated from the  H. Berthold AG type foundry in the
    late 19th and early 20th century. Newer versions were produced for the phototypesetting
    industry and the computer age. The new Akzidenz Grotesk version were designed
    under the direction of Gunther Gerhard Lange. The type face was released in in
    America under the name of Standard. Mainly the features were copied for the Helvetica
    halbfett grotesk was pattern after Akzidenz Grotesk.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough
    to have worked with the Berthold Fotoype group in Berlin while all this was going
    on."

  body: "yo.. x-y thanks for the links. turns out there is quite a bit in this site
    about this font.\r\n\r\nand cheers Robert, that was helpful too. That wuda been
    interesting working there too yeah?\r\n\r\nSo basically this typeface was designed
    by a group of people who kinda remain anonymous?? \r\n\r\nThey were all situated
    at the H. Berthold AG type foundry, but there is no real story behind the actual
    people tho ay?\r\n\r\nI reckon this font is like one of the Gods of Sans Serif's
    no doubt."

    to know research the Akzidenz story.\r\n\r\neg: like the word \"Grotesque\"? when
    it was first released people saw it as a grotesque font.. quite ironic dont you
    think? As it is quite beautiful.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I did a paper on Akzidenz last year and came to the conclusion that unless
    one knows German, and feels like spending a lot of time in central Europe digging
    through old books, the Typophile threads on Akzidenz are really the only in-depth
    examination of the history of the face. Erik Spiekermann confirmed that for me.

  body: "Martin Majoor\u2019s article in eye magazine no 63 is undoubtedly fresh and
    interesting, but it definitely should not be used as the only resource for research.
    Some of his assumptions are just that \u2013 assumptions \u2013 and there are
    some actual flaws in it.\r\n\r\nIn this article he writes:\r\n> As there was no
    other sans serif design available at that time, any model would have been a serif
    typeface, but which?\r\n(and he is suggesting that Walbaum might have been a major
    influence on the design on Akzidenz Grotesk by showing the lowercase a of both
    typefaces in comparison)\r\n\r\nFirst:\r\nHis assumption that there weren't any
    other sans serif typefaces around when Royal Grotesque and Breite Grotesk (which
    later became part and/or predecessors of the Akzidenz Grotesk family) were designed
    is simply wrong. There were already some other sans serif typefaces available.\r\n(And:
    why should the sans serif have been necessarily modelled after a serif typeface?
    Reading Nicolette Gray's 'Nineteenth Century Ornamented Types and Title Pages'
    one could also come to the conclusion that there was some connection between early
    sans serif typefaces and ornamented 19th century typefaces. I know that for us
    nowadays this may sound surprising, as we tend to see a sans serif typeface as
    something without any ornaments, but contemporary reactions to the first sans
    serif typefaces seem to indicate that people with taste and distinction saw both
    ornamented typefaces and early sans serif typefaces as something crude and quite
    uncivilized \u2013 and they said so. The connection between moderist thinking
    and sans serif is a phenomenon of the 20th century, not of the 19th century)\r\n\r\nSecondly:\r\nThe
    caption for the illustration of the lowercase a of both typefaces (Walbaum and
    Akzidenz Grotesk) in comparison says:\r\n> A comparison between the basic character
    shapes of Walbaum (1800) and Akzidenz Gotesk (1898)\r\n\r\n(Now you would have
    to pick up eye magazine no 63, p 32, because the online version doesn't show any
    illustrations)\r\nThe shape of the a is indeed quite similar in both typefaces,
    but the thing is that what we are seeing is not the original 'a' of the metal
    version of these two typefaces, but the digital versions (which were actually
    re-creations, done much later). In the design of both these versions, Guenter
    Gerhard Lange was quite involved (he was artistic director of the type design
    unit at Berthold at this time). So, what Majoor is actually comparing in this
    illustration is not (original) Walbaum and (original) Akzidenz Grotesk, but Lange's
    redesign of Walbaum with Lange's redesign of Akzidenz Grotesk \u2013 and suprise,
    surpise, there are similarities! \r\n\r\nThe article in eye continues:\r\n> If
    Helvetica was regrettable, then there is a whole range of typefaces that were
    designed in the 1950s that deserve the same criticism. Again, as in the 1900s,
    all the type foundries followed one another, afraid as they were of losing market
    share. The result was a range of neutral typefaces such as Folio, Venus and Mercator\r\n\r\nWell,
    Venus was around about 4 decades earlier. Already the guys at the Bauhaus used
    it sometimes.\r\n\r\nMartin Majoor's article is a fresh polemic against Helvetica,
    but for serious histoical research you have to find some other resources as well
    and draw your own conclusions. (If you find anything new, please let us know.)"
