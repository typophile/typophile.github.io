    federal trademark registration for this design was filed on September 20, 2011\r\nhttp://www.trademarkia.com/kc-masterpiece-85427596.html\r\nI
    believe this is lettering/artwork and not based on a single font.\r\nIn some ways
    the letters are similar to a sans with Clarendon style serifs added to the base
    and top of the vertical strokes. Check for example the letter-forms and terminals
    for C, c and e in Euro Sans Cond Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/euro-sans-pro/
    There are also similar features with some serif fonts, such as  the lobe on r
    Jakob Erbar's Candida, as suggested by Fivos. Also, Walbaum or Sirba http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/sirba/
    for the top terminal on the s. The diamond dot on the i is a feature of some Fraktur
    designs.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
