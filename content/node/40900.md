body: "hi everybody,\r\n\r\ni haven't seen this font in too many other places, and
  i can't seem to find what it is called. don't really know how to describe it except
  to say that it seems like a sexy script font with curves but also some hard edges?
  (or do i just think it's sexy b/c it is used for this pin-up artist?)\r\n\r\nanyway,
  any help is appreciated! thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13782578_5456.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/9783822829301_5165.gif]"

    faithful reproduction of the common French Ronde of the nineteenth century; the
    design originates at the Inland Typefoundry in St. Louis as French Script and
    was revised by Morris Fuller Benton in 1905 and made popular by ATF under the
    name Typo Upright. Stephenson Blake also had a version available as Parisian Ronde.\r\n\r\nhttp://images.google.com/images?q=Parisian+Ronde&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hutchings2_6719.jpg]"
