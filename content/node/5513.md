body: I am working on the mechanical for the paperback version of this book cover.
  The printer looked in their files from the hardcover version and said the typeface
  being used is Courier. So there is some kind of mix-up. And I haven&#39;t been able
  to identify the font. The closest I have come is Amasis. But this isn&#39;t it either.
  Any help would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40085.jpg"
