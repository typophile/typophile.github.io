body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMy local pub (near my letterpress printing studio) has decided to
  expand to a new (second) pub that'll be just round the corner from a couple of big
  publishing companies. \r\n\r\nAll the houses in the area were originally built for
  printers, so it would only seem right to have a printing related name for the new
  pub.\r\n\r\nThe landlord's current pub (my local) is called the Rusty Bicycle and
  they'd like a similar name (quirky adjective followed by printing term) for their
  new place, without the printing name being too obscure (preferably, the non-designer
  public will know what it means).\r\n\r\nCurrent favourites:\r\nThe Wonky Press\r\nThe
  Inky Fist\r\netc\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? \r\n\r\nThanks"
