body: "I am mac based at work and I had an issue with a font.\r\nI opened a pdf in
  acrobat and the font on my screen was different and printed out different than a
  co workers computer did.\r\nI went to my font library in my macintosh hd and loaded
  the font that they said they had. Then the font showed up after i restarted acrobat
  and opened the file. I run suitcase as well. What is the deal? Do i have to have
  all the fonts i use in suitcase in this font library in my hd. I mean i go through
  a lot of different fonts during the year with different jobs.\r\nCan anyone give
  me advice on this?"
