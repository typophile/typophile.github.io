    alt=""> <BR> <BR>I am working on cleaning up all the small imperfections, and
    I am playing around with the e, i, r, and j to make them look more cohesive. Do
    any others look unfit?  <BR> <BR>

  body: I like the idea, but it almost looks like there are 2 different fonts here-one
    set with black dots and another with straight lines.  For comparison, look at
    the m and n.  There are some nice forms though, I particularly like the letters
    styled like the a, b, d, etc.  Nice work.

  body: I have changed many of the letters to fit the style much better. I have also
    taken the &#34;dots&#34; out because I think they were rather cheezy looking.
    I  still think the r is not fitting, so I will work on that one still. Does the
    x look fitting? I still see it as a little off, but better than before. Any suggestions?

  body: Angie, what sort of genre do you think of your font as being a part of? The
    reason I ask is that it looks kind of techno-ey in a way, but also it seems to
    have some Art Deco elements to my eye. <BR> <BR>Keep going with it!

  body: In response to John, I also noticed it has some art deco and techno-like feel
    to it. It wasnt my intent at all though. I began this assignment thinking I would
    create a typeface that juxtaposed the disco era with hieroglyphics. After playing
    around with many different forms I noticed that they all had a &#34;space-like&#34;
    feel to them.  <BR> <BR>Disco &#43; Hierpgyphics = Spaceballs?    <BR> <BR>sweet!
    <BR> <BR>But now I need to name it, and I cant decide on a name at all.  Any ideas?

  body: Much better.  Save your old ideas, too, maybe you can extract another font
    from those ideas.  I think the x is fitting.  You may want to print out a copy
    at 14 point, just to see if the strokes thin out too much.  Overall though, it
    looks pretty darn good.
