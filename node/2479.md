  body: 'I should point out that from books I see, Trade Gothic has  Light, Regular,
    Bold, and Bold No. 2 weights &#40;that is the term you were looking for, I think&#41;,
    with an Oblique version of each. It also comes in two additional widths: Condensed  and
    Extended. Both have a Bold &amp; Regular weight, and the Condensed has both weights
    in Oblique form too. That makes a total of 14 fonts. <BR> <BR>However, I applaud
    the idea of looking for a fresher alternative to a design from 1948. Eduardo suggested
    <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10663172097593320&amp;fontname=BentonSans"
    target="_blank">Benton Sans</a> from Font Bureau &#40;which I think is a retail
    version of Benton Gothic, a 1995-2000 Font Bureau Studio Font, available only
    by special licensing from them&#41;. Both are new takes on Morris Fuller Benton&#39;s
    News Gothic and related designs produced for ATF in the period before 1910. There
    are 26 fonts, so there would be more variety, but not much noticeable difference
    in appearance to the average reader &#40;I don&#39;t mean the font fanatics you
    find at this Board&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you are truly looking for something to set
    you apart from Trade Gothic, which is itself a near-copy of News Gothic, it seems
    you might want to consider something different from either of them.  <BR> <BR>There
    are too many fonts being designed to keep relying on the same designs with new
    names and more weights.  <BR> <BR>What are the features that Trade Gothic has
    that you like so much? The 2-storey g? The simple monotone weight? The machined,
    precise look? The x-height? The mostly-closed C?  Do you want a &#39;transparent&#39;
    typeface? These are all questions to answer in your own mind and then start looking
    at font families. <BR> <BR>Some newer families you may want to look at: <BR> Hoefler&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html" target="_blank">Gotham</a>.  <BR>House
    Industries <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO" target="_blank">Neutraface</a>.  <BR>Terminal
    Design&#39;s <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/retail_specimen.php?ID=1001&amp;viewFam=1"
    target="_blank">ClearviewOne</a>.   <BR>Storm&#39;s <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/jsans.html"
    target="_blank">John Sans</a>. <BR>Or for something more different, Storm&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/sebastian.html" target="_blank">Sebastian</a>
    <BR> <BR>These are only a few families. LucasFonts and FontFonts also have a range
    of sans serif designs.  <BR> <BR>Go explore them all and see what attracts you.

  body: 'I was searching high and low for a different sort of gothic as well, and
    I&#39;m very happy to have settled upon <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=aaux">Aaux
    and Aaux Office</a>. You can see it in use <a href="http://www.impacttheatre.com">here</a>.
    In addition to the weights there, Neil Summerour is either about to release or
    has just released black and poster weights as well as small caps/OSFs. One thing:
    if you do decide to purchase Aaux &#40;this doesn&#39;t apply to Aaux Office&#41;,
    make sure you ask T26 for real quotes/apostrophes -- Neil had decided against
    it when he designed the face, but in my view it severely limits its application.
    When I asked, T26 was kind enough to supply me a version with angled quotes &#40;Neil
    was completely fine with their doing so, by the way&#41;.'
