  Gilda. It's from the title sequence. I've attached a link to the image, and a website
  with the image. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nhttp://annyas.com/screenshots/updates/gilda-1946-charles-vidor-rita-hayworth-glenn-ford/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gilda-title-still_3860.jpg]\r\n"

    link to move the thread up to the main Type ID Board, someone could give some
    suggestions on similar ones, like Spire for \"Gilda\"."
