body: What are you all using? I had been using Font Explorer. Love the interface but
  it's been giving me lots of problems. I'm doing a demo of Suitcase Fusion, trying
  to decide whether to buy it. Hate Font Book, that's not an option. I'm pretty anal
  about organizing my fonts, it will take me half a day, so wanted your thoughts before
  I commit.

  body: The only font management app in the Apple Store is Fontcase, which freezes
    up miserably on me every time I try to use it. Honestly, I'm still stuck on the
    free version of Font Explorer, because it works.

  body: On a PC, your options are even more limited.  At work I use FontNav, which
    doesn't even support OpenType, and at home, I just install everything in Windows
    (7) which might go some way to explaining why my computer keeps crashing all the
    time!  In terms of organising them, I don't.  I think the best method is to hang
    around Typophile day in day out until you can recognise every single font ever
    made, and you'll always have the perfect font for any job stored in your brain
    ;)

  body: Extensis Suitcase Fusion 3 has been more than adequate for me. I'm running
    it on Windows 7.

  body: Some folks literally do manage their fonts manually, which is nuts. It's a
    ton easier these days without having to worry about font suitcases and screen
    fonts vs printer fonts, but still.

  body: "Hi Patty\r\n\r\nFontCase under Mac OSX 10.5.8. Plenty of options for your
    own organisation, good interface seems to understand how anal we might be about
    this kind of thing, and includes customisable options for pangrams and body copy
    for comparison purposes (I seem to recall that you do a lot of text setting).
    I bought my copy in 2009, have never looked back, and would recommend it to any
    other Mac-using typophile. More details <a href=\"http://www.bohemiancoding.com/fontcase\">here.</a>"

    It would be a step back. \r\nWhat are your problems with FontExplorer? Are you
    using the latest version? I am sure these problems could be fixed. "
