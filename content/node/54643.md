body: "We are happy to announce the release of two new font families.\r\n\r\nOne is
  the award-winning [[http://www.type-together.com/ampl_font.php?idpuente=21| Skolar]],
  by David B\u0159ezina, a 4 weight family which has been designed specifically for
  scholarly multilingual publications. Prominent serifs and low-contrast modulation
  give the typeface a fairly robust character. Its relatively large x-height sets
  the typeface proportions somewhere between book and newspaper typefaces. The capitals
  are rather low in comparison to the ascenders to give the typeface even texture
  and more space for capital diacritical marks. These characteristics were introduced
  to improve readability in smaller sizes. Additional 2 weights are planned for April
  2009.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Skolar_6316.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe other
  release is the beautifully poetic [[http://www.type-together.com/ampl_font.php?idpuente=20|
  Aliz\xE9]] by Tom Grace, a three-weight typeface inspired by the chancery italic
  of the 16th century. It is a high-contrast face, created with syncopations in axes
  and proportions and subtle irregularities that form a lively and delicate weave,
  suitable for setting a single word, a special expression, or a short block of prose.
  The family does not contain a roman, and instead promotes the italic as a primary
  style, a common printing convention in the 16th and 17th centuries. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alize_4112.gif]\r\n\r\nFor

  body: 'I really like Skolar. The ink trap (A, v, etc) is surprising me, but probably
    pretty efficient. I also like the subtle broken line between curves and straight
    lines. Nice typeface to use in corporate or advertising document. Good work! '
