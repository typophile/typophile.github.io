body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nNot so much an I.D query but in need of suggestions.\r\n\r\nAm
  looking for a font in this kind of vein - http://www.hypefortype.com/browse-fonts/font-categories/exclusive/sawdust-newmodern.html\r\n\r\nI
  don't feel this works with the headline I am using, 'young blood' very well. I'm
  after something that is super elegant, unique and suitable for a high fashion context.
  I want something a little understated and delicate but with a bit of a twist and
  am currently a bit stuck. \r\n\r\nOpen to any suggestions at all, would be much
  appreciated, :) thanks. "

    feel...I think a Didone is what I have in mind, something with strong contrast
    in the thicks and thins...thanks for your suggestion.!
