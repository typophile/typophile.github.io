  you\u2019d probably still be checking your phone, don\u2019t lie), I\u2019m likely
  not the first person to tell you about Matthew Butterick\u2019s <em>[[http://practicaltypography.com/|Practical
  Typography]]</em>, a new read in a long line of essential reads on typographic rules.
  Butterick\u2019s writing is especially refreshing and particularly useful for explaining
  these sometimes confusing and cryptic details to the novice or the first-year design
  student. \r\n\r\nThe suggestions on [[http://practicaltypography.com/how-to-pay-for-this-book.html|how
  to pay for this book]], however, are leaving me indecisive and guilt-ridden. Paying
  for the book by purchasing a font doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea\u2014I wish
  I could buy everything in fonts! However, with my options ranging between $90\u2013120
  (for one weight of Concorse or Equity) and $5 (suggested cash payment), should my
  payment level be based on my intended use of the book? My bank statement? My Klout
  ranking? \r\n\r\nDoes the type community suffer from an embarrassment of [free]
  online riches (*cough* Typophile *cough*) so that paying for a good one seems impractical?
  While much effort in the industry is focused on educating users about investing
  in licenses to quality fonts, are we giving away too much of our expertise on the
  web? Who hasn\u2019t benefitted from these resources?\r\n\r\nSo, here\u2019s my
  experiment in reader-supported publishing: I\u2019m going to let you, dear Typophile
  reader, decide what I should pay for <em>Practical Typography</em>. [[http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/K36T5QM|Feel
  free to take this survey]], which will close on Friday, August 2, 2013. \r\n\r\nWhat
  if fonts become a new digital currency, like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin|
  bitcoins]]? Now that\u2019s the most practical idea I\u2019ve come up with today."
