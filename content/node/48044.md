body: "Hi, all. I'd really appreciate your critiques of this wordmark I'm working
  on. It's Helvetica Neue with the l borrowed from DIN Mittelschrift and slightly
  altered, and a single story a built from Helvetica's d.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Let me ask you this, why would you want the Clashmore word mark as opposed
    to the avatar you have. It, the avatar, is much more interesting, individualistic
    and thought provoking than a series of san serif letters strung together with
    no distinguishing marks other than some of them are altered characters.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: The wordmark and the monogram in my avatar are actually for two separate things.
    Also, the wordmark is only part of the logo. I'm looking to get some thoughts
    on how it could be improved from a technical standpoint.

    some distinction. I rather like his avatar and yours Eileen!\r\n\r\nThe Clashmore
    is JUST fine.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "And I would not make fun of either of your symbols. \r\n\r\nEileen, does
    your avatar/logo appear on your printed ephemera? IF so/not why/not. Perfectly
    lovely, as is Robert's.\r\n\r\nIf it is inappropriate, for purpose, then it should
    be changed. I was under the assumption that Robert's avatar could have been his
    logo and thought he did not need to change a thing.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "No problem Robert. I know a nice mark when I like one. : ) \r\n\r\nAnd I
    liked yours. \r\n\r\nI am just soooooo done with the sans as the definitive modifier
    in the identity environment.\r\n\r\nUnexpressive at best. Unless it is expressive.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I would not appreciate me too much cause I am about to catch a ration for this
    remark.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I agree with you, Michael, on both the aviatar comments and also on sans.
    Clashmore's aviatar is excellent. An aviator is an important part of a typophile's
    clothing.  My own aviatar is crap, but it will do until I get around to doing
    something better and more appropriate.

    our last contact.\r\n\r\nNow you guys want to see some talent see this guy. \r\n\r\ntyperror@aol.com\r\n\r\nSend
    me your info and I promise I will have the package off to you in less than 1 hour,
    provided the post office is open. \r\n\r\nAs to your avatar, being the illustrator
    you are I am sure it will be brilliant, no magnificent. But what you have is DISTINCTIVE
    as is Robert's. It is so good to see your name. You were a voice of reason on
    the calligraphic site.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    path.\r\n\r\nI am not sure they are ready for the tour de ink. No pumped sans,
    just expressive nuance. Something that is sadly lacking in a lot of contemporary
    design.\r\n\r\nLet us start a new thread in the a.m. Your a.m. Oh hell, you are
    on the down side of the work day! Ok, I will start it and you and some others
    can pick it up. I will nudge them. I got dirt on the calligraphers. That will
    be the title! OK?\r\n\r\nMaybe Miss Tiffany will give us our own little corner.
