  body: "If you like this one maybe also take a look at [[Font Bureau]]'s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/barcode/\">Barcode</a>.\r\n\r\n<em>\"The
    five-part Barcode series offers an ultra condensed design where successive styles
    are all the same weight, an experiment for the type designer and user in character
    interaction as the form of the typeface is varied by style and/or size. In each
    new font, the characters are not wider but taller than the last, opening opportunities
    for stacking, change by change, line above line.\"</em>"
