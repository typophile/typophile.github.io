  body: That's not really based on ITC Avant Garde Gothic methinks. Too many differences.

  body: "very odd proportions with narrow S, U, and V, yet very wide N. P,  and B.\r\n\r\nDoes
    not quite have that art nouveau thing going either. Probably custom. I don't care
    for it much. There are far better hairline caps out there to be had. the latest
    one-liner catalog from Font Bureau has a few decent ones.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
