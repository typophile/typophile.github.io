  is an all-cap \u20183-D\u2019 display font which automatically alternates positive
  and negative tiled characters, by means of the Contextual Alternates feature.\r\n\r\nChecker
  is an attention grabber suitable for logos, titles and short headings. With its
  tiled construction, it\u2019s a natural for colorful interpretation. The letters
  are properly italicized and back-slanted, and adjusted for maximum readability within
  the constraints of the font\u2019s concept. The letter style is bold grotesque,
  so Checker will mix smoothly with any other fonts in a layout. \r\n\r\nAfter I had
  completed the typeface, I came across the old <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3Rc6Tb9etmc/SrOPO-9HQ2I/AAAAAAAABwQ/Mqr5sT5tXcY/s320/This+Is+Cinerama+Program.jpg\">Cinerama</a>
  logo (1952-1974), which has some resonance. When working on the face, I was aware
  that I was channeling nostalgia for a kind of counterpoint layout that was popular
  in the early 1950s, involving bold type and large areas of spot color, without referencing
  anything in particular. Memory and imagination have interacted to bring a half-grasped
  style, exotic in its vague recollection, into sharp reality, further informed by
  themes explored in recent work:\r\n\r\nContextual Alternates (it's my fifth typeface
  to explore this OpenType feature), monowidth (Panoptica, 2005), ambiguous perspective
  (I spoke on linear perspective at Typo Berlin in 2009), extreme italicization (Figgins
  Sans Italic is at 20\xB0), and the tension in readability between letter perception
  and word perception (an issue much discussed at Typophile).\r\n\r\n<em>\u2014Nick

    the \"Victorious Underdog\": it starts from an unlikely or oddball concept, and
    then, through sincerity and hard work, wins you over. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cinerama_5119.jpg]\r\n\r\nSorry
    about the atrocious lighting. This original Cinerama signage has miraculously
    survived near the corner of Sunset & Vine in Los Angeles, near where I live.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally
    it's right next to the former site of [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/53061055@N05/4899192676/in/pool-721766@N24/|my

    the white letters to counter the "eating-away" effect of reversed-out text. Nice

  body: "James is correct, this principle is well known in signage (FF Info, for instance,
    IIRC, provides differently weighted versions of the same \"weight\" for positive
    and negative use).\r\n\r\nIt is further complicated by the issue of reflective
    vs. backlighting.\r\n\r\nIn this thread, I made my specimens in Photoshop, and
    was more concerned with getting the colors to work well with one another, than
    preserving the absolute weight of the type. Two Photoshop actions affected the
    weight:\r\nFirstly, the choice of type antialiasing mode.\r\nIn the following
    sample, it goes Smooth, Sharp, Strong, from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bergaults_Flat_5856.png]\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    I used the paint bucket (Fill) a lot, and again, the anti-aliasing setting came
    into play, eating into edges.\r\n\r\nHowever, even recognizing the effect James
    mentions, I'm not sure it would apply to Checker, because it's debatable, for
    a particular character, whether the letter or the tile is the figure or the ground.
    That's particularly apparent in the first specimen at the top of this thread (with
    the black and red check background), where the yellow negative tile space behind
    the black letters really jumps out much stronger than the yellow letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    role of the border and background plays a significant role in the viewer's perception
    of the type in a sign; in James' specimen above, there is:\r\n\r\n- Ample space
    between type and frame\r\n- A keyline around the frame\r\n- A grey background\r\n\r\nThese
    all serve to focus attention on the weight of the type.\r\n\r\nIn my specimen
    immediately above, the absence of a keyline around the solid tiles makes that
    setting recede, weaker, so the other style, black lettering on \"white\" tile,
    does not need to be emboldened to hold its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
