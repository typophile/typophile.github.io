body: I'm curious to find out what other typophiles think of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bembo-mt/schlbk/">Bembo
  Schoolbook</a> with it's altered a, g & y. I know that some people believe that
  these letterforms are easier for children to read. I am not among that number. But
  is there any good reason to make these alternates available? are there better-looking
  versions that what we see in Bembo Schoolbook?

  body: "I wonder if any writing teachers start their pupils out with binocular \"g\"s.\r\nSurely
    the single storey g and q are too similar -- a fact attested by the addition of
    a check-mark to the q, which has to be later unlearned, a pedagogic kludge if
    ever there was one.\r\nWhat can be so hard about drawing two circles and connecting
    them with a short line?"

    looks good.\r\nApparently children say they prefer the g, y and a forms of schoolbook
    fonts as they are now the handwritten forms, though they read no faster with them. "

  body: The altered glyphs in Bembo Schoolbook are ugly. That is what I think. They
    go against the rest of the typeface.

  body: "Oh, ecch! What is that? I agree with Paul. \r\n\r\nI think the least appealing
    aspect is having the same shape descender on the 'g' AND the 'y'; so much for
    distinct letterforms. What's wrong with a diagonally-tailled 'y'?\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I write single-storey 'g's, (surely they're easier for cursive writing, and therefore
    for speed), doesn't mean you have to abandon the double storey 'g' for typefaces
    derived from designs created in the metal days... \r\n\r\nHaving said that, we
    were all taught to write those single-storey 'a's as well, and at about the age
    of twelve I spontaneously switched to doing double-storey 'a's just because I
    felt they looked better. I still know they're slower for me to write than single-storey
    ones would be but what the heck it's a habit now...\r\n______________________________\r\nEver

  body: "I think such \"primary\" glyphs are useful (although certainly not in such
    a bookish face as Bembo) but only for absolute beginner readers (and only because
    they form the -sad- standard of current alphabet instruction). Once they've been
    learned, and the child (or foreigner) can read them quickly, they should be replaced
    by full print forms.\r\n\r\n> the addition of a check-mark to the q, which has
    to be later unlearned\r\n\r\nWell, I wish it didn't. (And does it really? I'd
    say it depends on us a bit.)\r\nTo me the best \"q\" for reading is the one with
    a single-sided bottom serif.\r\n\r\n> these alternate glyphs give a juvenile feel
    to the design.\r\n\r\nWhich however is lost on the target readership, so that's
    not so bad.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Alternate forms don't need to have a special purpose. They can be purely aesthetic,
    make a typeface new. When I saw <a href="http://typographi.com/000490.php">Plantin
    Schoolbook used in <em>Wallpaper</em></a>, I said "Wow, that looks and reads great.
    What is it?" Turns out it was just the old standard with primary forms.

    complexity might help learning, eg \"that's the letter that has two shapes, normal
    and superhero\"."
