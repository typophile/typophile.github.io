body: 'What''s everyone''s opinion: bullet points vs. paragraph ad copy?  I''m talking
  about a full page ad here, and meaningful communication with the reader.  Are bullet
  points boring?  Is paragraph-style copy too intimidating to read?  Does it depend
  on the situation?'

  body: David Ogilvy was not averse to bullets, if the "points" to be made in the
    copy were sufficiently unrelated that putting them in paragraph form would result
    in cumbersome prose with no flow. If there were a lot of them, he used numbers
    rather than bullets. --<em>Ogilvy on Advertising</em>
