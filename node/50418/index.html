  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone!

I'm desperately curious to know your opinion about this logo made by local designers for the fast food chain- russian fast food- we paid them good money and they try to convince us it's a master peice...but i doubt for some reason...


sorry for Cyrillic font...but general look is what matters i think...
the name of the venue is BOLSHOY KUSH which can be put into english as KING'S RANSOM or SCOOP or BIG ROLL...smth like that


well so every opinion will be of great value to me


thanx in advance

It is showing a single, raw, cooking ingredient. If the logo really needs a pictorial element you need something that looks more appetising. It doesn't have to be food itself. It could be some kind of dish food is cooked in or served from.

but just going off the information you've presented I reckon it's pretty lame.

first, and most of all - it doesn't say 'fast food'.

I'm guessing there wasn't a whole lot of research done into demographics etc.

Should it? At least here in the US, fast food is *not* synonymous with healthy food.

This logo 'feels' more like an artisan bread shop/cafe, so maybe it's in the right direction.

All that said, it's nearly impossible for us to give you anything but gut reactions on the aesthetics without a lot more details. 

My pure gut reaction: these are hardly the worst logos I've ever seen, though perhaps not the best either. But not knowing the budget/process, I can't really say if they were a good solution for your needs or not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. The combination of "fast food" and "healthy" - at least in the U.S. - would have been an interesting and different design project for any designer. (To be able to convey good-quality food, available fast-food style.)

Maybe they could have experimented more with the concept of "fast" in combination with "quality" in the type design. It is an interesting combo, since the two concepts don't inherently go together...

Any update on a new design? I'm curious to see the final logo.</div>

Not necessarily ... but if it's "fast food" it's gonna have to communicate with people in a different way (to the way it does) - in my opinion.

As you say it's feeling more "artisan bread shop" at the moment - which might be fine. The original info we had to run with was "fast food." It doesn't say fast right now, which seems to be the key message.

Although healthy has been added to the mix too now.
