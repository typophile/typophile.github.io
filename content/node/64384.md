body: "Hallo everyone. I have an interesting question.\r\n\r\nI am designing a photo
  book with lots of photographers contributions from different countries. It is a
  dutch publisher, but the book is in english only.\r\n\r\nOne section contains one
  contribution per photographer, and it is in alphabetical order according to the
  names of the photographer. \r\n\r\nThere are a few of them which have last names
  starting with W, and one of them is W\xE5hlstrand.\r\n\r\nMy dutch colleauges sorted
  it as if the \xE5 was an a, but the photographer is swedish, and \xE5 comes almost
  lasst in the swedish alpahabet. While it is not in the dutch and english alphabets
  at all. \r\n\r\nSo my qusetion is, should I treat it as an \xE5 or an a? The book
  is in english, the photographer is swedish, the publisher is dutch. How do I treat
  an \xE5 in english alphabetica order?"

    you can find the alphabets of the euro languages in their native alphabetical
    order. Since the book is in English, then the order should be in the English alphabetical
    order: http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/english.pdf\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nClaus"

  body: Yes isn't it nice. You will have to Google how to properly deal with the alphabetical
    order of non-English characters in English.

  body: "As this book is targeted at an international audience, rather than Swedish,
    one would use \"international\" sorting. That comes down to simply ignoring all
    accents, treating \xE5 and \xF8 as a and o, respectively.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about
    \xE6: \"a\" or \"ae\"?"
