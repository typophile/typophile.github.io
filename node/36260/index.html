  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's some samples of a new pointed brush font I've been working on. It's being drawn on the wrong side of Epson photo paper with a Japanese Pentel brush pen and of course redrawn (I do ok with a brush but I'm not that good yet) and edited in Illustrator to create the connections. I've redrawn the upper and lowercase about 5 times now to get to where I'm at. I'm unsure about the L, k, s and z and I'd like some opinions on what everyone thinks about the direction it's going.

		<div class="commentbody">i think it's quite nice! the lowercase seems a bit too tight in places, esp the right side of the o, but in many other places as well. i think the lettershaps you're questioning are just fine, but i found the u a bit ambiguous i stopped reading when i came to it because i couldn't decide if it was a u or an en. The S seems wonky, something just not quite right about it. overall it feels very nice though, keep up the good work!</div>

Could that be because of the very thin spine?

I understand that the tool dictates the shapes in this case, but maybe if the weight would be on the spine a bit more, it might look better.
I think most writing tools put the weight on the 'ears' of the S (because of the angle), so to speak, and that historically speaking, the weight was shifted to the spine, to balance the shape. Or am I mistaken?</div>

Thanks everyone for the advice and compliments! Here's a new sample with loosened up spacing and also the reworked S and u. I also reshaped the s and made a few other minor changes.

		<div class="commentbody">I like this very much. It has a nice loose flow, but still looks a bit tight - you could easily make the lead-outs a bit longer to get more inter-character space. For a more authentic handwritten look you could also introduce many two or three character ligatures in OpenType, (especially duplicate characters together), and also have some replacement end characters without the long lead-out stroke.

I'm having a spacing dilemma. Everything looks ok to me except the double s combination. Would it be a bad idea to use kerning to move them away from each other instead of how a kern normally works? Here's an example of how that looks with the double s kern:

At small sizes the exit stroke on the s (the little half loop) is a little flat. Or maybe I should say it is sharp. And the terminus on the e seems flat, perhaps the t as well. I assume you're working on alternates?

This is fun. (I know I said that already but I couldn't help writing it again.)</div>
