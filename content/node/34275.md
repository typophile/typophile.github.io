  body: "Ah yes, I remember that thread well. Of course, it would have to be one of
    the available digitizations, and I would guess <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/wiescher/newyorkertype/\">FF
    New YorkerType</a>. Nick's right about Desdemona = Quaint Gothic (Spiece) = Quaint
    Black (Solotype p. 47). Microsoft did have a digitized 'Desdemona', but it was
    the Open (Quaint Open) version.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
