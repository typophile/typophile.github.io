body: 'Before Rob Janoff designed Apple&#39;s famous logo, they had a, to put it mildly,
  _less_ professional logo... <BR> <BR>It looked like this: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.mactechnews.de/user_images/forum/__AppleFirstLogo.jpg"
  target="_blank">http://www.mactechnews.de/user_images/forum/__AppleFirstLogo.jpg</a>
  <BR> <BR>It was hand-drawn, so I&#39;m not sure there is an established typeface
  that looks exactly like the one used in he banner, but I would still appreciate
  if you could attempt to classify it. <BR> <BR>It looks similar to some versions
  of Caslon. Many of the characters are pretty close to Big Caslon included with Mac
  OS X. On the other hand, the &#34;R&#34; is very different, the O is drawn with
  an almost constant stroke width, while in Big Caslon it is elongated. The difference
  in weight of the two strokes in the &#34;A&#34; is greater in Apple&#39;s logo.
  I browsed some Caslon-related typefaces on [5] &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon/"
  target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon/</a>&#41;, but couldn&#39;t
  find a better match, though. The Caslon at the very end of this page &#40;<a href="http://graphicdesign.sfcc.spokane.cc.wa.us/tutorials/process/type_basics/type_families.htm#oldstyle"
  target="_blank">http://graphicdesign.sfcc.spokane.cc.wa.us/tutorials/process/type_basics/type_families.htm#oldstyle</a>&#41;
  looks like an excellent match too, but the page doesn&#39;t specify exactly which
  font was used. <BR> <BR>Is there some other family that&#39;s a closer match? I&#39;m
  researching this so that I can add it to my article on Apple&#39;s typography on
  Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography</a>'

  body: I would say it is more or less in the Caslon vein, but idiosyncratically executed
    by the artist. The R is the most unusual departure. I can only think of a few
    typefaces with an R like this &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bodoni-twelve/bodoni-twelve-itc-bold/testdrive.html?s=APPLE%a0COMPUTER&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">ITC Bodoni</a>, for instance&#41;. The C is also a bit exaggerated.
