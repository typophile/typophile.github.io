  myself slowly falling in love with the delightfully quirky Cheltenham family.\r\nThe
  only digital version I could find (ITC) seems to've lost much of it's charm (along
  with a handful of ligatures and text figures.) I recognize the merits of the new
  design, homogenizing upper and lower cases for modern sensibility, but miss the
  quirk. At least they kept that funny lower-case g :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chal_4865.png]\r\n\r\nAre
  there other recreations, more faithful to the original design?"

    But be careful when shopping, because Bitstream also did an ITC Cheltenham with
    the goofy x-height."

    onto Matthew Carter's Cheltenham? Because I love it.
