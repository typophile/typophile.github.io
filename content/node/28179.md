    (available with its text counterpart Classica), and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=waters%20titling">Waters
    Titling</a>, and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=CA.6676.0.0">Mantinia</a>
    have many titling ligatures, tho I'm not sure if this particular set is included.
    At least they can get you started.
