    to a 1995 collection by Panache.  I couldn't get to any actual sales site - what
    google found leads to a  'page not found' at FontHaus.\r\n - Herb"

    The font says it is copyright 1995 by Panache Typography\r\n\r\nfrom Font Haus:\r\nBased
    in London and founded by the legendary and talented British typologist Dave Farey,
    Panache Typography has been a part of FontHaus since the early 90s. This great
    collection of period revivals and exclusive designs have always been popular.
    Some have ranked in our top 50 sellers every year since we first introduced the
    library!\r\n\r\nBut no Aries at Font Haus site that I could find."
