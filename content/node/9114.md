  body: I&#39;m sorry. I told you my mistake. <BR>AmarilloUSAF is right. <BR><a href="http://www.tlai.com/med_des/amusaf.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.tlai.com/med_des/amusaf.html</a> <BR>The R&#39;s hole&#40;?&#41;
    of B-52 is square. <BR>But the R&#39;s hole of your sample is hexagonal, not square.
    <BR>The AmarilloUSAF&#39;s hole is hexagonal.
