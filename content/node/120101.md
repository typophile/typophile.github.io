body: "So this is a custom logotype done by <a href=\"http://inhousedesign.co.nz\">Inhouse</a>
  but I'm trying to find some similar style typefaces. It seems to be a blend of a
  face like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura-black/\">Futura
  Black</a> and some other angular <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/latin/fonts/\">Latin
  faces</a>.\r\n\r\nThough they don't have a stencil flair to them I am liking <a
  href=\"http://velvetyne.fr/#bluu\">Bluu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/matrix-ii-ot/\">Matrix</a>.
  Feel free to throw out some favourite typefaces in this category."
