  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi typophilers,</p>
<p>New time poster on typophile from Brighton UK here attempting a typeface based on a logo designed for our company - a design studio in the UK. Attatched is the typeface which is to be printed in a black foil and embossed, but for the moment i have added some lighting effects to give you the idea of the final outcome. Here i am attempting to create a typeface that is of a heavy weight and resembles latex when used as a logo.</p>
<p>I have developed the typeface for a mailout and am now extending the face into a full working typeface. I believe it could be fairly interesting when completed. The face uses influences from rhythmic calligraphic stokes and from heavy weighted Caslon faces. I have added a humanist element to the face as well.</p>
<p>I am doing okay with square based characters such as M and N, however v,w,s are all proving difficult and wondered if I could get a critique and advice from you all. Ill supply more artwork too when i can. Cheers!</p>

<li>You have both ball terminals (as with f) and teardrop terminals (r, v, y, w) - maybe try using just one kind. :)</li>
<li>The top of the t is very pointy.</li>
<li>The round glyphs need to overshoot upwards and downwards mathematically from the non-rounded ones to look right optically. Try moving those up or down until they look &ldquo;equal&rdquo;.</li>

<p>I&rsquo;d agree with the previous post — and I think the teardrop terminals are much more interesting. I can see why you had the ball terminal in the logotype but the key in type design is harmony.</p>
<p>Re overshoot, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure the arched letters and in fact any curves overshoot the x-line and baseline until those shapes appear the same size. Oh yeah, that was already mentioned.</p>
<p>Counterspaces of /e/ are not happy. Crossbar of /t/ should not come to a point — square-ended would look stronger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit difficult to judge when the letters appear in different posts. Could you set an alphabet and post a pdf?</p>

<p><strong>to Brian</strong> – Re: Ball terminal-I cant find a good example of an &lsquo;f&rsquo; with a half decent tear-drop terminal, would you suggest using a similar tear-drop terminal to the v, r and w?</p>
<p>The pointed t - would you match the top of the &rsquo;t' more to the solid width of the l and h rather than coming to a point?</p>
<p>The round glyphs - the e, o and t - these overshoot the x height by 2% at the moment- is that enough? maybe it doesnt show in the visuals. I will play around with them though.</p>
<p>The extrema of the &lsquo;e&rsquo; - do you mean pulling out the bottom left area? its already pretty weighty?</p>
<p><strong>to Bendy</strong> - Greetings, im on kensington gardens, glad brighton is being well represented here.</p>
<p>Do you not thing the rounded shapes are optically correct? any area in particular?</p>
<p>the e - Is the counter space too wide/large?</p>
<p>cross bar of the t - I agree, I think ill try to match it to the serif, still not sure what to do at the top though, it looks ugly if I match the top of the &rsquo;t' to the vertical stem of the &lsquo;l&rsquo;</p>
<p>I will amend the f crossbar too. Ill send out a pdf of the typeface to date later on tonight, got a few other projects to busy myself with today. My personal website by the way is <a href="http://www.breakandassemble.com">www.breakandassemble.com</a> if people are interested. Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>would you suggest using a similar tear-drop terminal to the v, r and w?</em></p>
<p>No. While it needs to flow in similarly, I&rsquo;d recommend starting by smoothing that ball terminal into a teardrop shape. If that needs work still, you can put the other teardrop terminal glyphs on another layer and compare them to see what&rsquo;s up. Minion and Garamond probably have something similar to a teardrop terminal by the way. :)</p>
<p><em>would you match the top of the &rsquo;t' more to the solid width of the l and h rather than coming to a point?</em></p>
<p>You could try adding another control point and sort of softening the pointy top area.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/t_bold_4546.png] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/t_reg_4097.png]</p>
<p>Note the top on both glyphs has softened apexes.</p>
<p><em>The round glyphs</em></p>
<p>Play around with them. :) The problem is most especially with, say, the r - it&rsquo;s arm looks much lower than the stem. Step back a few feet. Squint. Do the tops and bottoms of letters look equal?</p>
<p><em>The extrema of the &lsquo;e&rsquo; - do you mean pulling out the bottom left area? its already pretty weighty?</em></p>
<p>It looks &ldquo;lumpy&rdquo; in a way, you can pull the bottom point a bit to the left and open open the inside some if you think that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Great progress! 
Here are my observations; I&rsquo;m not a professional so be wary of taking my comments too meaningfully.</p>
<p>Widths: /s/ is rather wide especially next to /h/ as /h/ and /u/ are quite narrow. I&rsquo;d recommend previewing more words with those letters and bring the widths into harmony a bit. Look at the relative counter sizes. /r/ may be a bit wide, but it&rsquo;s a great design.</p>
<p>/f/ and /t/ I think I&rsquo;d make the crossbars wider and define the foot of /t/ more. It looks a bit shy. Could you add more weight to the teardrop of /f/?</p>
<p>Love the curved downstroke of /v/ and /w/. I think you should draw /y/ the same way. Also that downstroke starts below the x-line, making it look low. Try putting the vertical centre of that entry stroke on the x-line. Love those big blobby terminals. Perhaps pull in the final upstrokes, it&rsquo;s pulling the counter to the right somewhat. Put some overshoot at the baseline of all these (perhaps not /y/).</p>
<p>Your hyphen seems large enough to be an emdash.</p>
<p>Perhaps a hair more overshoot on the rounds?</p>
<p>Some swash alternates would look very groovy.</p>

On weight, thicks of the rounds need to be thicker to optically match the thickness of the straight stems (e.g., /o/ looks much lighter to me than, say, /h/). Diagonal letters are also relatively light compared to the vertically dominated glyphs. (Or, of course, you could narrow the vertical stems instead of widening the curved and diagonal strokes.)</div>

<p>Thanks for the compliment on Ambicase Modern. The foundry is my own, Teeline Fonts, and I&rsquo;m distributing through resellers—right now it&rsquo;s just at FontShop but that will expand to others in the coming months. [[http://typographica.org/2008/on-typography/taking-your-fonts-to-market-foundry-reseller-or-go-solo/|Stephen Coles&rsquo;s 2008 overview]] answered many of my questions about taking fonts to market, including the typical percentage cuts taken by resellers.</p>
