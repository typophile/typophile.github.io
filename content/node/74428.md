body: "Hi everyone. I'm a student at Savannah College of Art and Design and I was
  hoping you guys could help me out. For my digital page and web graphics class, I
  have to make a new ad for a campaign. I am doing the \"Perfect\" Patron ads. Here's
  an example of what I mean \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fadingad.com/blog/manhattan/nyc_patron_34th_street.jpg
  \r\n\r\nI need to match up all the type that is in there so I could make a similar
  ad. The type at the top I think is a transitional style serif so i was thinking
  of using something like Baskerville or even Caslon (even though it's technically
  not transitional). I would like this project to turn out as best as it can, so I
  would like the exact face. The faces used at the bottom of the ad like for \"Simply
  Perfect\" would be appreciated as well. Look forward to taking part in discussion
  around here, just really busy and need some help right now. Thanks\r\n\r\n                                                                                                         -
