  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I&rsquo;m, new here and relatively new to the wonderful world of typography. I&rsquo;ve spent the past weeks reading up on the topic and watching some Lynda.com courses on typography, but I&rsquo;m still very much a beginner.
I&rsquo;m designing two book covers and would like some suggestions regarding the font. One is a novel and the other one a popular philosophy book, both written by me, both containing the same philosophical message.
The genre of the novel is &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo;, a bit like the books of Paulo Coelho, with a romantic as well as philosophical slant. 
The philosophy book uses the same inspirational philosophy as the novel, but is written as non-fiction, even though it is still accessible for a general audience, i.e. it&rsquo;s not dry, academic stuff. 
On the one hand, I would like the fonts for both the novel and the philosophy book to be the same - that way readers would recognize &ldquo;the brand&rdquo;. On the other hand, I would like readers to see from the font that the novel and the philosophy book are different genres.
I thought that maybe using a sans-serif for the novel and a serif font for the non-fiction could do the job. Is this a good idea? And, if it is, which fonts would be a good choice?
The kind of qualities in the font I&rsquo;m after are light-hearted as well as serious, with an emphasis on elegance, a ballance between masculine and feminine. 
Because the books will be sold primarily on Amazon, the font has to be clearly legible, as the thumbnails people see tend to be small.
I&rsquo;ve already formatted the novel in Indesign, using Adobe Garamond Pro for both body and headings - after a lot of experimenting - just because it is so readable. However, if there is a better solution, I&rsquo;m open to it.
I don&rsquo;t have lots of money for the fonts, but many fonts are quite reasonable in price, so that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.
Thanks,
Antonie</div>
