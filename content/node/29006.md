body: "Ok I just moved to a really expensive part of town and I'm having trouble paying
  all these bills (where are they coming from and didn't I already pay that one last
  month??). I am employed full time and yet, they aren't paying enough. I really love
  my company and don't feel that leaving is an option just to pay the bills (I'd rather
  like who I work with). \r\n\r\nSo I'm asking anyone who has any freelance opportunities,
  please look at my portfolio, www.studio513.net and contact me if I can help. I really
  really really really really really need the work. My specialties are but not limited
  to publication layout and logos. Thanks!\r\n\r\nKim :)\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm located in
  Maryland but can work via email or phone for instructions."
