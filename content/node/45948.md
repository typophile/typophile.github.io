  I was wondering what fonts you've set r\xE9sum\xE9s in before, and what typefaces
  work best for that sort of thing. I did my sister's r\xE9sum\xE9 recently in Garamond,
  at her request.\r\n\r\nDo you know of any great or outstandingly beautiful r\xE9sum\xE9
  designs that stuck with you?  I'm under the impression that a r\xE9sum\xE9 should
  be a beautiful classical design, but I'm curious to see how more contemporary typefaces
  can be integrated.\r\n\r\nThanks a million!"

  body: "I always set my r\xE9sum\xE9 in something like Caslon - even when applying
    for design-related jobs; and pay extra attention to the margins and general layout
    of the page.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t the place for you to shine as a designer or
    typographer, this is the place to try and convey the information with as little
    distractions as possible. (If you're setting a designer\u2019s r\xE9sum\xE9, you
    have the portfolio that can take care of that other bit.) Go for too much color,
    too much ornamental bits or too creative typefaces; and it looks like you're trying
    to take the attention off of the content.\r\n\r\nMake it instantly scannable and
    readable, and let it be up to the content to grab the attention, not the typeface."

  body: "I use to typeset resum\xE9s for many designers in New York City during the
    1980s and 1990s. One thing that was always asked for was a simple, easy-to-read
    format. We'd use a display type or even logo for the person's name --and then
    a clean cut serif font. \r\n\r\nI was always asked to make the resum\xE9 fit on
    one side only. No matter how much experience the person had. There were many different
    theories but this made sense. The resum\xE9 would be the first thing looked at
    by someone who doesn't know you and is being bombarded with everyone's resum\xE9
    for the same job. The designers I dealt with believed their portfolios would speak
    up and be different enough to make them stand out - but that first piece of paper
    to introduce them was extremely important. It was the ticket in.\r\n\r\nWhen it
    comes to creative resum\xE9s there are several great examples. Dewine's Bogart-look-a-like
    resume -- Would you hire this Art Director? Another well known one I think may
    have been a Chas. creation -- of a fold paper -- that when opened (all folds lead
    to the center - sort of looked like a camera lense) confetti popped out of it.
    Sure made an impression, but didn't want to be the person who cleaned up the confetti!\r\n\r\nI
    think there may be a thread already on typophile on this topic where many ideas
    were brought forth."
