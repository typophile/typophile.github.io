The first thing that I would relate relate to my family in means of text would be old letters that were written to my family in the early 1900's. These letters were written in Sicilian dialect, and for any person not educated in this particular slang would have been thought to be a reproduction of a poem.The artistry in the handwriting was beautiful, having masterful stroke and an artistic swagger about it. However, at the base of the letter, I could not help to notice a large stamp of a black hand. Through further explanation, my father told me what that black hand print meant...It was la mana nera, also known as the black hand.(The "black hand" is the enforcing side of Nandrangita, aka. "the Mob" according to American standard)The letter was actually a warning letter that insisted on "certain" demands or "certain" repercussions were sure to follow. Evidently, someone in my family made someone very angry years ago in the old country. All I can say is that I'm glad my Nono made it here and lived a very long life, all the while avoiding any "black hand".

<div class=commentbody>Louie,
This is a wonderful story. Do you have a copy of the letter? It would be fantastic to scan and share it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wish I did! However, all of my documents, including my birth certificate and all family records were covered in three feet of mud that was delivered to us by our visitor almost three years ago.

<div class=commentbody>Louie,
This is the beginning of a short story! I, too, wish I could see an example of this letter and the "black hand." Since you can not find the letter maybe you can recreate it as one of your digital sketches. It seems as though you remember it quite well. Thank-you for sharing this. You are seeing how typography is all around you.</div>

<div class=commentbody>That was a very wonderful story. I could actually formulate a picture in my mind from the use of your words and description. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes m'am, I wish that I could show you, yet I have no tangible forms of the letter since the storm. There were actually five or six different documentations of it, I'll try and look it up....not too sure if it can be found..I actually would like to find it my self, especially being that I lost my connection after my Nonna died during the evacuation from Katrina.
If I could find it, I will definately post it.
Btw... at a time, my ToTo was the oldest living immigrant in the state, I could possibly find the interview that the Times Picayune did on him in the late 90's...I would enjoy other people hearing his story. My only grief with that would be the " the "!true!" story of what actually happened concerning his life. I'd like to talk to you outside of the internet for that.
