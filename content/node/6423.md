  body: Your second sample is similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/lithos/">lithos</a>,
    but lithos is kind of a cliche in this context. <BR> <BR>Look at the suggestions
    in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;topic=83&amp;page=11974">this
    thread</a>.

    CC-Regular</a>.

  body: The first one might be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/copperplate/ef-light/testdrive.html">Copperplate
    EF Light</a> slighty modified &#40;squashed and a modified &#34;O&#34;&#41;. If
    not, you still could obtain the same result starting from Copperplate.

  body: You could also see <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=LFT2354400"
    target="_blank">Phoenikia</a> from Letraset, or <a href="http://www.unifonts.com/intropag/p_intro.htm"
    target="_blank">Pompeia</a> &#40;serif or sans&#41; from Unifonts. <BR> <BR>These
    probably fit the cliche category, but I think at least these avoid the pseudo-Greek
    Latin lettering of Acropolis at P22.
