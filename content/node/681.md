  body: KPT didn&#39;t have that function. There&#39;s a couple ways to do it. The
    best way is to create your halftone screen in photoshop, and then run it through
    Streamline, or another autotrace function. The roughness of the autotrace can
    lend a good look to that, but I wouldn&#39;t use it with anything over say 20
    lpi or so. The dots would just be too small, and have too many points. <BR> <BR>The
    second way, which is less likely to work consistantly, is to use the set lpi function
    in Freehand. However, a lot of imagesetters will just override that, and you&#39;ll
    end up with a flat field or gray or color.

  body: thanks sean, youve given me a few ideas. <BR> <BR>pity there isn&#39;t a program
    or plugin out there that can do this in vector, as i would have liked to be able
    to do all the halftone screen effects; round, lines etc. without the chunkiness
    of a bitmap.

  body: 1 iota -  <BR> <BR>Besides what Sean said...here&#39;s something else you
    can do. <BR> <BR>After you convert, select all the points and go to <BR> <BR>Edit
    &#62; Convert to &#62; Circle <BR> <BR>Actually, you will have to deselect the
    &#34;main piece&#34; <BR>or pieces. <BR> <BR>the surrounding halftone blips will  <BR>become
    decent looking circles instead <BR>of malformed globs, a&#39;ite mate. <BR> <BR>bj

    i&#39;ll have to pick up a bit of freehand.
