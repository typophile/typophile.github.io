body: "I've recently decided to get a small tattoo of the Latin phrase \"plus ultra\"
  in all lowercase italics (I haven't quite decided where yet) but I'm having trouble
  coming up with a typeface that is quite what I'm looking for. I know very little
  about typography, but I feel like I'll know it when I see it.\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for something that is simple and clean, but will not be without visual interest
  on its own. I don't want something very bold nor something flowery but I'm hoping
  to find a balance between delicacy and strength. It's a motto I live by, and I want
  the font I display it in to reflect that. I want it to convey futurism and optimism
  without being gaudy or trendy. I've seen fonts capture an emotion brilliantly before
  and I'm hoping to find one that can do that for me too. \r\n\r\nI typically like
  serifs, but I'm flexible. My favorites so far are Cochin and Perpetua, but they're
  not quite interesting enough to me (although I love the italic lowercase \"s\" of
  Cochin). I also like Helvetical Neue Ultra Light, but it doesn't really have the
  gracefulness I'm looking for. Cursive seems too self-conscious, if that makes any
  sense. \r\n\r\nSorry I can't be more specific than that. =/ Any thoughts? I'd be
  interested in having someone design it for me if the price is right and they know
  what I want, but I've never commissioned an artist before, so I wouldn't know what
  to expect of the process. I just figured typophiles would get what I'm looking for
  better than a tattoo artist. :)\r\n\r\nThanks so much for any advice you might have!"

  body: "Arno has a particularly fine italic. Chaparral's italic might also have some
    of the characteristics you're looking for.\r\n\r\nWhen I got my tattoo, I wanted
    it in a typeface that wasn't going to go out of style anytime soon, so I got it
    in Garamond Premier Pro Semibold, since Garamond's been around for 500 years and
    probably isn't going anywhere in my lifetime. Something to consider. Also, in
    retrospect I should have gotten the regular weight; I got semibold because I thought
    the characters in the regular weight would be too delicate to tattoo precisely.
    I should have realized that my artist was really skilled, and he wouldn't have
    had any trouble with it."

  body: Thanks for the great ideas! I hadn't even considered difficulties for the
    artist. I'll definitely have to keep that in mind. :)

  body: "When you mention \"futurism and optimism\", do you mean it as a theme or
    a concept? As in do you want the font to have a modern feel to it as well, or
    you prefer a generally conventional looking typeface. And does it have to be Italic?
    Is it because of how it can relate to the meaning of the phrase \"plus ultra\"?\r\n\r\nI
    personally would choose Eplica because of its elegant and yet structured form.\r\n"
