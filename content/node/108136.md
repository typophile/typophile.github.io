body: "I have been selling a font family for over a year now, and just recently received
  a few emails from users saying they are getting a System Validation Error in Font
  Book, and are advised to not install this font. It's only happening to a couple
  people, but I want to fix the problem. The font has always worked perfectly for
  me so there isn't really a way for me to test whether I have solved the problem
  or not.\r\n\r\nI've read some other forums on the subject... one solution was generating
  the font with hinting enabled. I checked my settings and this was already done.
  \r\n\r\nAnother suggested a solution that was on the user side:\r\n1. Deleting the
  file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist and then log out/in\r\n2.
  Install the 10.6.2 combo update\r\n\r\nI can't test this as the issue doesn't apply
  to me, but is anyone confident enough in that solution that I should email it out
  to consumers? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!"

  body: 'An age-old problem: the end-user. Not all users keep their systems in the
    cleanest shape nor do they all use their computer in the same way, so no one answer
    will fit all. Since you don''t have a problem with the font then the font is probably
    OK. The simplest solution might be to have the users put the "problem" font in
    ~user/Library/Fonts rather than use Font Book to manage them. Font Book has never
    been known to be the best of font managers anyway.'

    in fonts. Looking at the style of CPL Kirkwood it maybe worth investigating to
    see if you have some overlapping contours or multiple nodes on the same co-ordinates.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Malcolm and George. Font Book drives me nuts, it seems to create
    issues where there is none. I've been trying to research what System Validation
    Error even means, but haven't found any real answers. Which makes it really difficult
    for me figure out if it's something I'm on wrong on my end. I hate going back
    to consumers and telling them that's an issue on their end, so I really want to
    find a solution.\r\n\r\nI will go through and see if there are any overlapping
    contours / nodes as well, maybe that will help. Thank you so so much!"

  body: "Grzegorz may have a point regarding the hinting of the font especially if
    you auto-hint on output. If FontLab is creating many, many hints for each glyph
    it maybe too much for the system, you may need to just insert a single ghost hint
    at the baseline position for each glyph.\r\n\r\nAlso for a distressed style of
    font you should turn off 'Use subroutines to compress outlines...etc'. FontLab
    may try to create thousands of small contour subroutines that will not be of any
    benefit and may cause errors.\r\n\r\nI am happy to run some diagnostics on your
    fonts for you if you wish (mwooden at dtptypes dot com)."

  body: "In a more general note, if your font is more about distressed texture than
    particular curve control, why not distribute it with TrueType outlines? Both problems
    Malcolm\u2019s just mentioned are of PostScript nature, so they wouldn\u2019t
    apply. TrueType outlines are in some measure also more \u2018native\u2019 technology
    to Microsoft and Apple, and both companies deal with it very well. Font Book,
    for example, would list the table with TrueType outlines and indicate it specifically
    in case of any problems, whereas the CFF/PostScript table didn\u2019t even show
    up in the report."
