  would like it to have a Korean feel and base it on a traditional yin yang, please
  see the attached image.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/klogo_4098.jpg]\r\n\r\nCould
  anyone please suggest any western typefaces that have a similar feel to the Korean
  symbols surrounding the yin yang in the attached image? (I would like to have the
  exhibition title going around the yin yang) Thank you very much in advance and any
  help is greatly appreciated!\r\n"
