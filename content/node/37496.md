body: I have a printer that can spit out some really sweet-looking stuff, but it lacks
  Postscript support. Is there a way to make Indesign and Illustrator provide high-quality
  rendering on GDI printers?

  body: "I asked around a little, and found out that from InDesign there are 2 fundamental
    paths to print to non-postscript printers from OSX:\r\n 1) print postscript and
    the print driver will use Adobe's distiller to rasterize the page.\r\n 2) have
    InDesign print a bitmap.\r\nThere is an option in the advanced panel (I think)
    that controls this. Some other controls may become active/inactive based on this
    control. You probably should experiment. "

    also speeds the printing from Indesign as it just sends PostScript to the spooler.\r\n\r\n"
