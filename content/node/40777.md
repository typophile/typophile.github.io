    ago quite a bit. I venture a guess that it is an old form of Copperplate, but
    it is NOT Copperplate Gothic.\r\n\r\nEnjah\r\n\r\n\"With identical bricks, one

  body: "Hi Enjah and David\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help. I've looked at
    the fonts that you suggested (Palatino, Copperplate Classic Round, Block Gothic)
    and unfortunately none are an exact match. They're all pretty close, though; I
    may wind up using them if I can't find the real ones.\r\n\r\nI've used all the
    usual online font-identifying websites as well as looking at some (gasp!) actual
    font books, but so far no luck. Usually finding a font isn't nearly this difficult.
    These two have me stumped, though...\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\nT"

  body: Thanks very much, Akira. There's also a version of Sackers that might work
    for the 2nd font that I needed.
