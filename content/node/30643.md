  graph notebook with a grid of 5mm (subdivided into 5 units of 1mm).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  had a fruitless trawl of the internet. <strong>Moleskine</strong> do a nice range
  of <a href=\"http://www.moleskine.com/eng/_interni/catalogo/Cat_int/catalogo_notebooks.htm\">notebooks</a>
  with a grid of simply 5mm (no subdivision). <em>Close but no cigar.</em>\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have an idea of where I could pick up something like this?"

    in it, but at the rate I doodle/draw I\u2019d need about six of those a year.\r\n\r\nTa."

    for sketches. Didn\u2019t enjoy that though \u2014 I\u2019m too neat.\r\n\r\nI
    might just design my own."

    can create PDF graph papers to your requirements, including grid colours. I've
    done this and put then in my Moleskine notebook. Plus you get to choose the paper
    stock that you print on."

    what I\u2019ve been using for A4-sized sheets up \u2019til now. A very handy resource
    tool.\r\n\r\nGraphic Image\u2019s notebooks\u2019 grid looks ideal (always wondered
    why folk paint the page edges gold), but they are slightly too big for my pockets."
