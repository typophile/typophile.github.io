body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ncomplete newbie to the site - my first post in fact ;o) Stumbled
  across it while looking for a solution to a problem which you may be able to help
  me with - yes you!\r\n\r\nOK, I'm redesigning my company logo, after years of freelancing
  in my spare time I decided to take the plunge and start out working for myself full-time.
  The logo I'm currently using was knocked up just before I sent out my first ever
  invoice, to actually go on the invoice letterhead itself and as such was a bit of
  a rush job. I'm now looking to change the image and have created something i think
  is a bit more classier and, well \"designed\" (i hope)!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/infrared_4722.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  this is what I'm going for - I target mainly large businesses who do alot of advertising
  and producing literature (brochures, catalogues etc) and therefore want to portray
  myself as a serious, professional in the design industry.\r\n\r\n\"What has all
  this got to do with me\", you may be asking yourself? Well - I need to find a complimentary
  typeface to go with this logo. I have tried so many that now I am utterly confused
  and fed up trying to decide so I thought I'd throw it out there to some other pro's
  and see what you guys come up with.\r\n\r\nThis font will be used for the details
  on my stationery as well as the main body copy for any promotional literature in
  the future. I want something classy yet modern-ish (maybe?) that plays well with
  Bank Gothic and is easily legible. Open to serif/sans serif suggestions - have ruled
  nothing out yet.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts and comments on the logo also appreciated.
  Cant wait to hear some thoughts...\r\n"

    do you think of the spacing between the RAR?"

  body: An edgy option is Emigre's Cholla Wide with oldstyle figures. Or, if you want
    a clean, neutral wide-ish sans serif, try FF Bau with oldstyle figures, similar
    in feel to ITC Franklin Gothic.  Or FF DIN, or Adobe Folio, or Univers.

    not complimentary.\r\n\r\nI like your logo a lot, but question the type. The cyrillic
    R is too commie for your target market. The logo is subtle and classy, but the
    wordmark ain't.\r\nI don't think you need a symbol AND a wordmark.\r\nWhy not
    have the company name in understated boldface of the main company typeface?"

  body: "Hi peeps!\r\n\r\nSorry i haven't been answering any posts - been v.busy with
    work so no time to play with my own stuff ;o( but much appreciated all the same
    ;o)\r\n\r\nI had already been looking at Univers and Din, but i definitely like
    Bau, especially the numbers, hmmm. More food for thought, not sure if i done myself
    any favours offering this out there, just gives me even more to choose from, lol\r\n\r\nNick,
    thanks for pointing out the spelling, i live by my spellchecker and crumble without
    it unfortunately. Interesting thoughts though. I kind of liked the idea of having
    both symbol and wordmark so i could use either or both depending on the area of
    application, but I will have a play with your suggestion, am always happy to receive
    constructive advice ;o)\r\n\r\nBut hey, if any of you suddenly sit bolt upright
    in your sleep with divine inspiration for a suitable font, scribble it down because
    i would love to hear them - might leave this open for a while, not because i'm
    indecisive or anything but..."
