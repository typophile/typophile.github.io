  body: 'Articles about type that show up in (relatively) mainstream media are interesting,
    because they help us understand how the general populace (read: people who aren''t
    on typophile) thinks they relate to type. It''s easy to scoff at the uneducated
    opinions (the commenter who said that she uses Arial on her husband''s website
    and Impact for photos comes to mind), but there is still something we can learn
    from articles like this. I''d be interested to know whether Colleen can recognize
    Georgia when she''s not selecting it out of a drop-down menu. Do the positive
    associations she has with Georgia (probably the second- or third-most common font
    on the web) carry over past her own writing?'

    get angry.
