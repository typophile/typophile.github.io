    be custom.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the look, you could play with the proportions and
    soften the edges of a Clarendon Black (you'd also need to add the serifs to the
    top of the A:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/clarendon/\r\n\r\nIronmonger
    would require more work (rounding off the sharp edges, adding the serifs), but
    it has very similar proportions to your sample.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/ironmonger/"

  body: "UPDATE:\r\nIn my original post I suggested a Clarendon for possible modification
    to match.\r\nOn reconsideration, I see that this would be a rather daunting task.\r\nMy
    current opinion is that this is lettering not based on any specific font. I note
    that the stroke thicknesses and other details vary more than is generally found
    in digital fonts.\r\nOut of curiosity I vectorized the letters and here are the
    results, standardized for a font with an X height of 686 points. I cleaned up
    a fair amount of the variation but it it is still lettering:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PalliniVectorized_6266.jpg]\r\nThe
    dimensions might be of some use in making a digital version of the letters.\r\nDon"

    mentioning that the letters in this sequence could be interpreted as trademark
    infringement. So that's not recommended.\r\nDon"

    body: "Hi Don \r\n\r\nFirst off, hats of for the feedback - Thanks so much.  This
      has been playing on my mind working this one out. \r\nIt's been like a Sunday
      crossword puzzle.  \r\nAt first I saw the A and thought it was a strange take
      on a sort of rounded Rockwell, then the L threw me in the direction of Clarendon
      like you pointed out but nothing came back when i searched for it.  I think
      you are absolutely right in that just these specific letters were drawn out.
      \ \r\nI was invited to do a project for this company and saw their old Italian
      logo as a starting point.  I have since resolved that project but the detective
      work on this lettering has continued - for reasons of curiosity and fun.\r\n\r\nThanks
      again!\r\nT\r\n"

    Similar letterforms -- if one one ignores the differences in the serifs -- independently
    evolved.\r\nDon"
