  of my favorite foundries, Sudtipos:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/la-portenia/\r\n\r\nMy
  questions are: \r\n1) Who customized it (t, i, and l)?\r\n2) What led to the tight
  crop?\r\n3) Isn't it time to let go of the \"temp\" violator and to carry the branding
  over to the Twitter page?\r\n\r\nModerators (or others in the know), thanks for
  your consideration...."

  body: "Unfortunately not a juicy story here- I customized it. The tight crop is
    a byproduct of wanting to fill the space, and simply typing in the font was not
    distinctive enough.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, removing the temp marker is long overdue.\r\n"

  body: "Jared, I find the logo great and hope there is no intention to change it.
    You've done a good job! How long ago it was designed? \r\nBecause of black and
    white colour, I think the red should stay somehow (twitter instead of temp?).
    It is more lively this way and adds a nice touch to the logo.\r\nForgive my ignorance,
    but what is \"temp\"? Of course, I should have asked myself a long time ago this
    question!...\r\nAnd Kevin, thanks for opening this topic. I thought the logo was
    custom made. I didn't know there is a whole font behind it, and a beautiful one,
    by the way!"

  body: '"Temp," short for "temporary." The current iteration of Typophile (including
    the branding) was, as I recall, a sort of stop-gap replacement of an older, broken
    system, and was not intended to stick around this long. Is that correct?'

    the then-current broke into million pieces.

    regard to the issue of content, I find our redesign playful because of the way
    the optical suggestions visually and conceptually activates the substructure of
    critical thinking."
