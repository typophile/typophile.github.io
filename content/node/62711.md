  Doorn, definitely printed in typopress. \r\nFollow the link: http://www.martinaflor.com.ar/martinaflor_design/others/research.html\r\nIt
  seems like a didot but please take a look at the details in the f and the j. I post
  both version regular and italic.\r\nSomeone recognize this typeface?\r\nThank you
  for the help.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's more of a Scotch Roman than a Didot, but as you say the indent on the
    'f' and 'j' make it not one I recognize immediately.

  body: "About the oldness of the book, I've been doing some research about the editorial
    (J. Heijnis Tsz. - Zaandijk) wich no longer exists, and I think the book might
    have been released around late XIX century.\r\nThe author is Johan van Doorn.\r\nThank
    you all for the answers."

    en Schipper Drukkerij]] - maybe there is an shop's archive - maybe they are even
    able to identify the types used. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a similiar font
    for the serif, you may try Augustea BQ.\r\n\r\nWolfgang"

  body: "Jan Middendorp's book \"Dutch Type\" makes it sound as if the latter part
    of the 19th century saw the Dutch copying typefaces from other countries. Only
    Ensched\xE9 and Amsterdam Type Foundry were in competition by that time. It seems
    that not much new Dutch design happened until the time of De Roos in the 1920's.
    I'm sorry if these details are wrong, but this is based on a quick scan of the
    text.\r\n\r\nI was trying to hunt for Dutch typefaces, and maybe that is not where
    to look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
