body: Hello again! <BR> <BR>I was wondering if somebody would be able to ID the 2
  or 3 fonts used on the covers of the Harry Potter books. The sample is a cut-up
  of the 3 text pieces on the cover of book 6. Books 1 through 5 use the same fonts
  if I&#39;m not mistaken. <BR> <BR>I wanted to make a mock-up Harry Potter cover
  with some sketches a friend did, and these fonts would make it look more authentic.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance guys! <BR>~Luke G<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67750.jpg"
