<p>We are proud to announce the new release of Veronika Burian’s multi-award winning Maiola. Originally released in 2005, Maiola was an immediate success. It won the renowned TDC competition in 2004 where it was also recognized as a “judge’s choice”. The update to this beautiful font family includes the addition of over 240 glyphs to the original character set covering Latin A, Cyrillic and Greek. Maiola 2.0 features new ornaments, stylistic alternates, ligatures, superior letters, fractions and more. Furthermore, several glyphs were significantly improved and the kerning was fine tuned for better performance.</p>

<p>EDUCATION Type design workshop in Ljubljana</p>
<p>Veronika Burian was invited to hold a type design workshop during the &ldquo;Festival of Letters&rdquo;, organised by Marko Drpić, tipoRenesansa, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The workshop covers many areas of the typeface design process and aims to jumpstart both beginners and amateurs into alphabet-drawing. The first day, students did some sketching exercises and developed their own design. On the second day, followed by a basic introduction to Fontlab, the students started to digitise their design and expand the character set.</p>
