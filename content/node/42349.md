  is new to me, so please excuse me if I'm totally out to lunch here. \r\n\r\nWe're
  doing a two page ad that runs at the bottom of each page. Pretty simple, but the
  units given to us are a little perplexing, 40 agates high by 21 columns wide. Agate,
  at 5.5 pt each give me 220 pts high, but I'm at a loss as to what the \"21 columns\"
  implies.\r\n\r\nI stumbled onto something that indicated that 1 column was equal
  to 14 agate, and something else that implied that this is not set in stone.\r\n\r\nThe
  rep at the paper seems MIA and we need to get this to them today and is further
  complicated by the fact that I am stepping in for another (now gone) designer who
  has created single page ads in the past, but the dimensions of those files don't
  ad up either.\r\n\r\nAny insight?"

  body: Are they printing this newspaper on a Vandercook? It's been a long while since
    I've done newspaper ads, but from what I recall, they used good ol' inches and
    centimeters for their ad sizes. You'd think a newspaper would make it as easy
    as humanly possible to help people get paid ads into their publication.

    been told that here in DC some newspapers even vary their definition of Agate!).
    If I were you I would call the switchboard and not get off the phone until someone
    provided an answer."

  body: No matter what units a publication uses, I always insist they translate it
    into inches for the particular ad I'm designing--and if they resist, I get my
    client, who's paying for it, to lean on them. Luckily plain old inches seem to
    be more common now for newspapers and magazines.

    the newspaper industry, it is. 1 column inch (not 1 column) = 14 agate lines (exactly
    ... forget the 5.5 point stuff).\r\n\r\nAnother term you might run into is double
    truck, which is two full facing pages. Sort of what you have, but not the full
    height.\r\n\r\nBack in the days when newspapers were kings, many papers had a
    rule that your ad could not be more than one column wide per 10 agate lines of
    height. These days, they will sell pretty much whatever they can."

    used to be 11.5\" x 21.5\" now it is 10.88\" x 21.5\".\r\n\r\nInk coverage has
    dropped also - LA Times is now 220 Dmax. I guess when you add all that up you
