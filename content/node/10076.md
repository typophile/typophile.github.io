  the center of the &#34;M&#34; does not reach the baseline in this font, and the

  body: It sure looks like &#39;Gridnik&#39;, beside what you mentioned about the
    &#39;M&#39;.. &#40; And the &#39;I&#39;.. &#41; <BR><i>&#40; Maybe they just modified
    and customized &#39;Gridnik&#39; for their own uses.. &#41;</i>
