    history, but i think  <BR>this is nice. just try to rework &#34;a&#34;, &#34;g&#34;,
    &#34;s&#34;  <BR>and perhaps make &#34;t&#34; taller.

  body: I&#39;m on WinXP and I just installed the Flash6 player for both NS4.72 and
    IE5, but neither will display the link... Could there be a problem with the new
    Typophile&#39;s delivery of Flash to Windows? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The file has a .unk extension. <BR>I wonder if this is some sort of bug with
    the web uploader used by Typophile... Flash should be .swf, otherwise Windows
    users will get a &#34;file download&#34; dialogue.

  body: I&#39;m on a Mac, IE 5.1. I exported the file in Flash 3 <BR>format and it&#39;s
    showing up as a .swf  in my <BR>browser, so there may indeed be a problem <BR>with
    the uploads...

  body: OK, it works now... Thanks. <BR> <BR>I normally hate this kind of thing, but
    for some reason this one has some appeal. Maybe because the collage isn&#39;t
    so literal, there&#39;s a lot of &#34;noise&#34;, which makes it more cynical,
    less hyprocritical. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I usually like this kind of thing &#40;really, it&#39;s fun how me and Hrant
    get along so well!&#41; but I appreciate it mostly when the surgeon&#39;s work
    does not show. The earliest example, besides Dead History, was Fudoni by Max Kisman.
    <BR>As Paul Shaw has written in an essay for my &#34;Letters&#34; book &#40;coming
    out before the end of the world&#41;, in Fudoni the letters were not collaged
    but &#34;smashed together&#34;. <BR>Bodolive does a similar thing and the result
    is not unpleasant, in my opinion.

  body: Looking at the uppercase B alone I think it&#39;s a good start. Then I look
    at the other characters and think they&#39;re too messy - the lowercase d, for
    example. I would take the B and start from there, don&#39;t just merge the two
    and say that&#39;s that.
