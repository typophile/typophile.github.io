  answered before.\r\n\r\nI'm setting a book for a student group I'm part of. Many
  of the essays have endnote citations. Is there a hard and fast rule about the amount
  of spacing that comes after the superscript character and before the next? I can't
  quite discern if a single space suffices, or if two spaces are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe
  text is Sabon 10/12 x 23 if it makes a difference."

  body: "Usually the superscript reference comes with no space from the text and separated
    with a single space from the following character \u2013except if it's punctuation,
    when no space is used.\r\n\r\nSometimes this single space after the referece seems
    very small because it's also formatted as superscript. The correct is to have
    just the reference as superscript.\r\n\r\nWith InDesign, you can fine tune this
    (for example, separating the number and the precedent text with a thin space)
    and automate the format through styles and footnote settings.\r\n\r\nAvoid the
    use of two spaces. An en space is the choice when additional blank is needed."

  body: "One does not use spaces for this, one uses tabs. The (superscript) numbers
    are aligned with a right tab (because they can consist of one, two, three\u2026
    figures), based on the widest case, and the beginning of the text with a left
    tab, so that the resulting spacing between the two is consistently vertically
    aligned. Any other approach leads to a messy, amateurish result."

  body: Ton, I understood the question as spacing the reference number in the main
    text (not the footnote number itself) because Hallock said "after the superscript
    character and before the next". But if the question is about the footnote numeration,
    I completely agree with you.
