  body: Do more with the central black rectangle. Because it is a regular shape with
    so much negative space it looks like a strange mistake, as if the artist accidentally
    dropped a black block into the design.

  body: The black background does not equate with children playing cards/having fun.  Loosen
    things up; lighten them up.

  body: "Vyaz\u2019 is not just another decorative style. It finds its use in, and
    is generally limited to, the opening pages of the clerical books (including Gospels),
    icon painting, various holy vessels, church bells, gravestones, monumental lettering,
    and the like. Both Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches strongly disapprove
    gambling. I personally find the use of vyaz in playing card design rather inappropriate."

  body: "@Maxim  \r\nMaybe I have not explaining this right . I am working on heritage
    language educational material for kids growing up in the US from different countries.
    The main objective of the playing card / flash card is teaching the alphabet for
    kids. I called it playing card because you can play the cards by matching the
    colors . BTW the image has to be as authentic as possible . \r\nThanks , \r\nAleme

    don't have to be used for gambling. And if I were into\r\npromoting religion I
    would find this to be a clever avenue. Like\r\nhow Apple donates computers to

  body: "I must say that, as an adult, my personal taste appreciates the complexity
    of the design.  And yet,  one can only wonder why such an esoteric lettering style
    was chosen as a backboard (of sorts) for the most fundamental level of learning?
    \ Would this not be similar to writing complicated mathematical equations on the
    back of flash cards for children learning basic addition?  \r\n\r\nIn this design
    case (still applies):  Loosen up; Lighten up.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTheo"

  body: "@ Hrant , How are you ? Long time Hrant ... (What was your personal e-mail?)\r\nI
    always like what you have to say .  I chose to do play cards to give parents and
    kids  to do  something together. I thought Parents can teach their children their
    heritage language in non formal setting and incrementally thru a game. \r\n\r\n@
    Theo Thanks, nice suggestions, will post my latest work this week . \r\nAs designers
    sometimes we have to design things out of our cultural boundaries,  Which should
    appeal to the intended audience. In this project I have to do Persian and Kenyan
    teaching material too. I think it would be nice to have  discussion here on typophie
    what is authentic ,what is global and what is universal . By universal I mean
    like a comment you made \"the black background which does not equate with children
    playing card\" \r\nWhat do you think? \r\nThanks,\r\nAleme     "

  body: ">\"the black background which does not equate with children playing card\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is just the backs, isn't it?\r\n\r\nIt looks \"serious\", as in those expensive
    Magic the Gathering cards or some high stake poker game -- not \"fun\". \"Serious\"
    <em>does</em> appeal to children, but I would say it depends on the design of
    the fronts (*). Are those featuring low-rez Little Doggy/Red Ball/Happy Sunshines
    in primary colours, or do they match the stark design of the backs?\r\n\r\n(*)
    Design-wise. I assume you know who your target audience is -- if this is for 6-8
    yrs old I would totally advise against yellow/white-on-black, geometric, bleak,
    uncompromising, astute, \"serious\"."

    like the concept, but I don't like the execution. The radius corners, the hollow
    corner flourishes, and I imagine those central things are a place holder for now?
    And the exaggerated ascender(?) seems gimmicky. Is that done simply to frame a
    central whatever?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your revisions."
