  campaign in which some railway coaches were specially decorated.\r\nCould any of
  you identify the typeface of \"Amsterdam 1992\" here? It looks a bit like Franklin
  Gothic Condensed (angled terminals, variations in stroke widths) - but that doesn't
  seem to be fully accurate, for example the \"1\" in Franklin Gothic is totally different,
  having a big serif at the base.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Amsterdam1992_4792.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Amsterdam1992_detail_3693.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Amsterdam1992_side_5580.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  and greetings! I'm planning to make a model of this.\r\n(edit: added two more photos,
  better angle/size)"
