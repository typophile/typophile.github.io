body: "Apple defines the decimal 189 entry in the codepage MacOS Roman as follows:
  U+03A9, so it references the Greek Omega sign rather than the Ohm sign in the codepage.
  Adobe in their Glyph List for New Fonts (AGLFN) recommends that the glyphname \"Omega\"
  maps to U+2126 (Ohm sign), which means that the Greek Omega sign should have the
  glyph name \"uni03A9\". Most older Type 1 fonts used the glyph name \"Omega\" for
  the Ohm sign, and Adobe Type Manager on Mac OS 9 did indeed map the the glyph named
  \"Omega\" to MacOS Roman decimal position 189. This resulted in the fact that currently,
  the MacOS Roman encoding and the MacOS Roman codepage shipping with FontLab products
  are not compatible with each other. \r\n\r\nWe at Fontlab Ltd. would like font developers
  to participate in a small <strong>poll</strong> to answer the question: Should Fontlab
  Ltd. modify the MacOS Roman encoding file (mac_roman.enc) so that the mapping \"Omega
  189\" is replaced with \"uni03A9 189\", which would meet all current recommendations
  by both Apple and Adobe?\r\n\r\nThe poll and more detailed explanation of the problem
  is posted on the FontLab forum: <strong><a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio/'omega'-vs-'uni03a9'-glyph-naming-controversy/\">\"Omega\"
  vs. \"uni03A9\" glyph naming controversy</a></strong>\r\n\r\nPlease visit and give
  your vote! \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
