body: Hi everyone <BR> <BR>here i am posting a stencil type developed in a 2 day workshop
  with the guys of B&uuml;ro Destruct in santiagop Chile. We went to a photo tour
  to &#34;LA VEGA&#34;, a place were you can find any kind of fruit and vegetables,
  and also a lot of handmade and stencil fonts. <BR> <BR>after like 2 hours walking
  through LA VEGA i realize that a stencil type was painted in a lot of wood boxes.
  <BR>here i send you the type and its inspiration. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41388.gif"

  body: I really like this stencil face. I don&#39;t think there are any real legibilty
    issues within any of the characters. I especially like the B, D E and P - I think
    these letters will help distinguish it from any other stencil face, such as Optimo&#39;s
    Cargo face.

  body: 'I think thats one rad stencil type.. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0> <i>Likeworthy..</i> <BR> <BR>What I especially love about it, is that
    its a &#39;soft&#39; stencil.. <i>&#40; It got a very nice organic, mellow, smooth
    and rounded look and feel to it.. &#41;</i> <BR> <BR>There is only one, single,
    character that &#39;bothers&#39; me, or that I dont think matches the other ones,
    that well.: The &#39;W&#39;.. <i>&#40; The middle part of the &#39;W&#39; seems
    too bold, too dark.. &#41; <BR> <BR>I also seem to notice the &#40; heavy &#41;
    influence of B&uuml;ro Destruct, as well, but maybe thats just me, and maybe thats
    a good thing, too.. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/plain.gif"
    border=0> <BR> <BR>Like John already stated, thats a whole lot of lovely found
    type photos, maybe you should submit them to the &#39;<a href="http://typophile.com/gallery/foundtype/"

    give it away for free! <BR> <BR>What was the B&uuml;ro Destruct class like, I
    was looking at some of there type today, and it seemed amateurish... <BR> <BR>Your
    Origen font seems better then anything I have seen from them. So maybe you should
    have been teaching the class...hehehe.. <BR> <BR>BTW. Did you see the samples
    of Origen in use I posted on Union : <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.unionfonts.com/2004/origensample1.html"

  body: Jim, I don&#39;t think you can class B&uuml;ro Destructs type as &#39;amateurish&#39;
    can you? To me there are some similarities in the style of fonts you stock at
    union.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Cristian, any new developments with this face?
