  Turner 08 text in the middle is what I'm trying to identify.\r\n\r\nlook similar

  body: I believe this is a custom typeface by James Goggin of Practise, but can't
    find it on his site at the mo. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_netto_ot/?affid=99346">FF
    Netto</a> is close, tho without the swashes. For the small stuff, consider <a
