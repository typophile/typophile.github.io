  in InDesign 2, and that the only proper way to get printable pdf:s was to print
  ps:es and distill them. When the cs version came, I was told that the problems were
  gone and that InDesign cs actally does everything ps+distiller did. However, when
  I analyze all possible problems with pdf:s created with cs in Acrobat, it still
  says that fonts are cdi type 0. Why? What are cdi fonts anyway?\r\nJesper"

    a discription of CID fonts.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that some printers (book printers,
    not laser printers) refuse to take PDF files that have mixed CID and \"non-CID\"
    Type 1 fonts. They report that characters drop out, & we've seen it happen. Whether
    this is a problem due to a non-Adobe RIP or an older RIP, I don't know."

  body: "CID's (also called 'double byte fonts') are used by InDesign to facilitate
    the use of another-language-typesets. They are supported by PostScript since 1999.\r\nDue
    to a bug in older versions of InDesign even typefaces with only Western-encoding
    were converted to CID's during the PDF-ing process. This has been remedied in
    the last version of InDesign (CS2 or 4.0).\r\n\r\nMind: All up-to-date RIPs should
    not have any problem processing CID's. It is known that some of the third-part
    ones do, eg Harlequin (upto the last update, I guess).\r\nUsing Distiller on a
    PS-dump removes some of the CID-encoding (mostly that on those Western-encoding
    fonts), but possibly not all of it, depending on the kind of font(s) you are using.\r\nBeste
    way to ascertain a problem-free work flow is to use up-to-date RIP's, preferably
    one with the real Adobe'flavour'..."
