body: 'My studio is designing a number of documents for a client. The client is exhibitng
  at a major trade show in Europe and would like each document in a number of European
  languages. They will be providing us with the translations from thier European offices
  and we will be applying the translated copy to our layouts. <BR> <BR>We are working
  with InDesign. Most of the translations will come back from Europe as MS Word docs.
  <BR> <BR>Languages involved will include German, French, Spanish, Italian and Irish
  &#40;Gaelic?&#41; <BR> <BR>My question&#40;s&#41; is what is the best option with
  regard to creating an accurate document. Specifically, do we need a copy of each
  language version of InDesign to successfuly import the word doc and retain the integrity
  of the copy? Or is there a translation plug in? <BR> <BR>Obvious issues would be
  special characters, ligatures ...etc. <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance for your help.

  body: ALl of those languages are covered under unicode, though Gaelige coverage
    is spotty.  Also, I&#39;m pretty sure all of them, except Gaelige have dictionaries
    included in ID for hyphenation and such. <BR> <BR>Fonts shouldn&#39;t be a problem
    as long as they have the required accent characters.  Ligatures should sub fine
    if they&#39;re included in the font as well. <BR> <BR>The only languages I believe
    the normal version of InDesign has problems with are the Middle Eastern ones that
    go right to left, otherwise everything should work quite well. <BR> <BR>Cheers
    to Adobe for realising that people shouldn&#39;t have to pay through the nose
    for &#34;passport&#34; versions of ID.

  body: Chris -  <BR> <BR>Thanks a million. You confirmed what I &#42;thought&#42;
    but was not certain of. I am the Non-Creative in our studio and thought I should
    ask before I assume. <BR> <BR>Are you aware of any issues regarding this and Quark?
    Same set-up or do they impose the language versions?

  body: 'Quark is limited to 8-bit encoding and font support: no Unicode support.
    You shouldn&#39;t have any trouble with the languages you mention, since they
    are all supported by the ANSI codepages &#40;so long as you are using the modern
    Irish orthography instead of the traditional one&#41;.'

  body: All of the above. Apparently Quark are working on adding Unicode support in
    version 7. They are also making noises about OpenType Layout support.

  body: Oh! One question about Quark, then. <BR> <BR>Am I correct to assume that hyphenation
    is covered as long as I am using the matching dictiony to the language I am importing?
    Or is that an issue for Quark?

  body: You need the dictionary for Hyphenation. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately Quark doesn&#39;t
    come with any unless you buy the Passport version, which is like twice as much
    as the normal one.
