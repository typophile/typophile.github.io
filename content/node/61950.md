  name: and
body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am looking for fonts for character charts like [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0370.pdf]]
  (only the grid/table on page 2 is relevant). More precisely, I need (1) a font suitable
  for fairly large glyphs in isolation, and (2) a font to use for small hexadecimal
  numbers of up to 6 digits (0-9, A-F).\r\n\r\n(1) Many of the charts will contain
  both Latin and Greek or Cyrillic characters, so these should all come from the same
  font. My current favourite is [[http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/ITC-Bodoni-72.htm|ParaType\u2019s
  ITC Bodoni 72]] for Latin and Cyrillic. Do you think the lowercase Greek letters
  from [[http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces20th.html|GTS Bodoni]] would
  work? (Most of the Greek uppercase letters are identical to Latin or Cyrillic letters,
  and many of the remaining can easily be constructed from similar Latin/Cyrillic
  letters.)\r\n\r\n(1) Other alphabets are also needed, most importantly Hebrew and
  Arabic, but fonts for those will obviously differ from the Latin/Greek/Cyrillic.
  Suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n(2) The hexadecimal numbers must be readable in
  a small size, and the font design should go well with the Latin/Greek/Cyrillic (possibly
  ITC Bodoni) as well as with letters from other alphabets. I was thinking of London
  Underground, but I am not at all sure about that. Part of the reason for using a
  sans serif rather than ITC Bodoni 6 is that it would presumably be more difficult
  to find fonts for Hebrew, Arabic and Asian scripts matching the latter.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help and ideas."
