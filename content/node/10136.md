body: I posted this in another section, but this area seems to get a little more traffic,
  so after a little bit of additional work, I thought I&#39;d re-post here. To be
  honest, I&#39;m getting to the point where I&#39;ve been looking at it for so long
  that I can&#39;t where things are and aren&#39;t working. <BR> <BR>I am currently
  working on a wordmark project for a faculty within a university. They have used
  a logo previously, but have decided to get rid of the logo as it was cumbersome
  to incorporate two logos &#40;the university&#39;s logo is required and standardized
  across campus&#41; all the time. The budget does not allow for a custom font.  <BR>
  <BR>The focus is intentionally shifted to emphasize &#34;graduate studies&#34; in
  order to distinguish them from not only the university as a singular entity, but
  also from other faculties within the university. <BR> <BR>I am by no means a highly
  experienced typographer, so I would love to get some feedback with regards to what
  we have so far. The powers that be seem pleased with it overall, but I would rather
  be nit-picky and ask the experts now rather than once it&#39;s too late. Thanks
  muchly!  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68896.gif"

  body: I&#39;d tighten up &#39;graduate&#39; a bit. Also, maybe try not justifying
    the top and bottom lines. Bring the UBC to the right a bit and studies to the
    left a bit.

  body: Agreed. <BR> <BR>Also, reduce the space between the R and A in graduate.  <BR>
    <BR>Reduce slightly the space between the T &amp; U in &#39;studies&#39;.  <BR>
    <BR>Maybe Make the word studies a bit smaller &amp; &#40; maybe &#41; open it
    up a little afterwards. The smallest letters &#40; UBC etc&#41; have big spacing
    &amp; Graduate less so - so &#39;studies&#39; should maybe be in between &#39;Graduate&#39;
    &amp; &#39;UBC...&#39; spacing. <BR> <BR>I tried to show you what I mean &#40;
    roughly &#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68904.gif"
    alt=""> <BR>  <BR> <BR>Ideally you might slightly increase the weight of Studies
    too so it ties into Graduate better. That would be tough without some training
    though!  And this is a little bit postmodern in design anyway so maybe it doesn&#39;t
    matter at all. <BR> <BR>my 2cents.

  body: Thanks so much for the quick response! <BR> <BR>To be honest, I&#39;m not
    sure just how subtle/dramatic some of these suggestions are meant to be. <BR>
    <BR>I agree that &#34;studies&#34; is a bit underweight, so to speak. No matter
    how much I wish I did, I do not have the training to adjust the weight of the
    font so that it better ties with &#34;graduate.&#34; Given that, I&#39;m concerned
    that bringing down the size of &#34;studies&#34; just exacerbates the balance
    problem. Not sure how to grapple with it, though. <BR> <BR>At any rate... is either
    of these looking better? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68907.gif"

  body: A! <BR> <BR>B looks confused to me - or maybe just too casual.  <BR> <BR>Maybe
    push the Studies back out a tiny tiny bit. The advice I gave about moving the
    word had to do with getting the type to be optically even on the right which is
    a judgement call &#40; rather than litterally or actually mathematically even
    &#41;.  <BR> <BR>I thought of 2 ways to deal with the weight issue without becoming
    a type designer &#40; or hiring one - you can&#39;t can you?&#41; <BR> <BR>Use
    a multiple master type face. Then you can specify the weight  for gradulate &amp;
    studies in small increments until it looks right to you? Not sure what this is?
    Seach on the board or at adobe or google. <BR> <BR>The other possibility &#40;
    evenb easier&#41;  is to use a Font with Small caps. Use regular CAPS for graduate
    &amp; the SC - small caps &#40; already designed to be used together &#41; for
    the Studies. <BR> <BR>Does the font you are using have a small cap? <BR> <BR>Really
    though I think you have done a decent job!

  body: The font is Stone Sans and Informal. It has a small caps, and that is a suggestion
    &#40;we don&#39;t currently have the full family, but will be getting it shortly&#41;
    that I will definitely try. Thanks! I never would have thought to try that on
    my own. <BR> <BR>Definitely no budget to hire a type designer. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t
    find anywhere that talks about an MM version of Stone, but if anyone knows of
    one, let me know!

  body: Cool. I didn&#39;t recognise the face &amp; had benn wondering.  <BR> <BR>I
    should also say that you may need to make the face 1 or 5 point sizes bigger or
    smaller to get the feeling you are looking for &#40; when using the Small caps&#41;
    but hopefully it should be just right at the same point size!

  body: Here is is using small caps for &#34;studies&#34;. I think it really helped
    balance with &#34;graduate&#34; so much better.  <BR> <BR>C uses a slightly smaller
    point size with more spacing, D uses the equivalent point size, with tighter spacing.
    I think I prefer C. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/69043.gif"

  body: I think you could be more aggresive with your positioning of the top and bottom
    lines. It was suggested to nudge UBC in from the left and Studies in from the
    right, but I think it can be done significantly more to dramatize the logo. It
    still feels a little too rigid for me, then again, this is faculty we&#39;re talking
    about.

  body: 'Yes.  <BR> <BR>This is better in general &amp; I agree that C is better.  <BR>
    <BR>I have been going back &amp; forth to look at the differences &amp; at first
    glance they seem quite similar but the &#42;feel&#42; different. Why? <BR> <BR>I
    think in tightening up the spacing some of the relationship between the UBC &amp;
    the Graduate Studies has been lost. The fonts are different &#40; obviously &#41;
    but there was a subtly implied realtionship between UBC &amp; Gradualte because
    of the spacing - which I liked. Don&#39;t get me wrong it isn&#39;t ruined or
    anything but I miss the connection.  <BR> <BR>Here is my suggestion: What if you
    took Graduate down by 3 pts &amp; Studies by 1pt &amp; opened the spacing slightly.
    Keep watching the alignment of studies. I think it might need a &#42;slight&#42;
    push to the right. It will feel a bit more refined &amp; shout less.'

    bottom more and although I like the effect, part of me wonders if it&#39;s too

  body: The only thing that really sticks out to me is that UBC F... seems to be too
    far to the left. It feels like it is going to drop off that cliff that is the
    G. Could you play with moving it to the right some? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: Yah, I think Kyle&#39;s right. Look at how the individual letterforms relate
    vertically as well as horizontally. Moving the top line to the right a little
    more will help the U-G relationship, but it should also help with how the F &#40;in
    OF&#41; relates to the U-A. Also, nudge the STUDIES back and forth to see how
    the E-S fits best with the T-E above it. I like where your logotype is going.

    <BR> <BR>Ok, I&#39;m working quickly since I&#39;m on deadline... but I think
    the U to G relationship is more solid now. <BR> <BR>I also played with shoving
    &#34;studies&#34; way farther left after Scott&#39;s comment about seeing how
    the E-S fits best with the T-E. Is it crazy that despite my &#34;too casual&#34;
    concerns previously that I am attracted to the triangulation effect in H between
    the T-E and S? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/69188.gif"
