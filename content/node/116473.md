  body: "Scale is small, but I'm seeing variations in repeating letters, particularly
    _J_, which suggests hand lettering.\r\nThis style of lettering is sometimes called
    faux oriental and has become politically incorrect for most purposes. Perhaps
    it's still o.k. for a Jiu Jitsu club? Here is a link to Luc devroye's page on
    oriental simulation fonts http://luc.devroye.org/o-sim.html Plenty of choices.
