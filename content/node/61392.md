  in [[Serbia]] (and perhaps Montenegro)? \r\nApart from [[http://jankojs.tripod.com/SerbianCyr.htm|that
  instructive discussion]] regarding mainly Italics I\u2019m interested in possible
  other special customs which differ from standard (Russian) practice. \r\nAny images
  of old type, street lettering, shop signs etc. known?\r\n"
