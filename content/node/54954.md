  blog post and probably also the most embaressing, but im going to post it anyway.
  With Valentines day just passed came a wave of fantastically creative gift ideas
  from all great designer partners out there. So the purpose of this post is to show
  some of the (hopefully) creative ways in which I have spoiled that special someone.\r\n\r\n101
  reasons to fall in love\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jo1_4282.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jo2_4420.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jo3_6068.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jo4_5028.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jo5_5725.jpg]\r\n\r\nOK,
  so there are tones of 100 reasons why I love you, so I wanted to do something a
  tiny bit different and added 1. I also did vector illustrations for 50 reasons and.
  The book was professionally printed with a hard back front and back cover. I stuck
  with avante garde throughout and with primary colours of black and pink consistent
  to maintain the identity.\r\n\r\nA chapter of a story every day\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book1_5112.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book2_4076.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
  this was for a woo week thing type event we had at work. The idea is that you draw
  someones name from a hat and spend the week wooing that lucky someone in secret.
  I teamed up with the creative copywriter of the company, and together we made and
  illustrated stories with a different chapter everyday. The story featured that lucky
  girl in question as the hero as she enjoyed an underwater adventure. I used one
  basic illustration style and make tweaks to the layout and colours on everypage
  to offer some variation. The primary colours also changed daily, but because of
  the consistent elements it kept its identity. Style wise I kept it prtty simple
  with vector style geometric shapes. Was very influenced by Keane under the sea album.\r\n\r\nCards\r\n\r\nThis
  should be a standard for all Graphic Designers as far as im concerned. These are
  a couple of examples I have done for friends. They are out of an A3 card on a heavy
  HP media paper. The paper is so nice and textured that a simple design works best.
  Add a message on the flap, fold three ways and tie with a ribbon. The fact that
  all thirds of a three way folded card are the same makes it pop up which gives the
  ribbon a really nice effect. Ultimately the result is a lovely hand made card, personalised.
  What more could any girl or boy want?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cards_5681.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
  thats it from me...thats what I have done...any thoughts, feedbacks or opinins welcome!\r\n\r\nany
  one else done anything graphically romantic recently, would love to hear about it?\r\n\r\nseen
  anything great that would work on a special occasion?\r\n\r\nAll the best and keep
  the design love alive! x"
