    like a good way to check if a typeface meets some minimum spacing/kerning standards.
    Of course, why not let the designer/foundry know?\r\nMore interesting though are
    actual uses of a typeface, things you designed with it. If you find that spacing/kerning
    is wanting you could do this: (1) Export a PDF of the document, including kerning
    adjustments you did e.g. in InDesign. (2) Then select all text and switch back
    to \"Metrics\" so the typeface's original spacing/kerning is applied and generate
    another PDF, and point to combinations you think are not ok. This is quickly done.
    It is useful for the designer because it also helps evaluate whether these are
    real spacing/kerning errors which need correction, or the designer and you just
    have different 'spacing philosophies'."
