  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Something new has happened here at Typophile. We've added a new membership section and it is only for the girls! Several of you heard about it at TypeCon, and tonight Jared made it so. Before we open up the floodgates, so to speak, I wanted to hear from the girls. What do you think it can become? What do you want it to be? Should it be exclusively X chromosome? I've already got a t-shirt contest in mind. We are discussing different possibilities for membership, so let me know what you think it is worth.  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Haha! Good reply Paul. One of the main reasons behind forming this &quot;club&quot;, is to get more girls/woman to participate. As much as I love the odds, I'd much rather share with other girls. Take TypeCon for instance, I heard someone mention that this year had more girls than ever participating. I think that is wonderful. The idea of being an Alphabetty is simply to show our presence, as a group, in the the bigger group of typographers, type designers, visual communicators and artists. Anyone can tell you that I'm one of the least sexist people on the planet. (long pause) I suppose the way I objectify Jude Law isn't healthy though. ;)</div>

By and large, women have their own conversational style [see the studies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dbooks%26field-keywords%3DDeborah%20Tannen%26url%3Dindex%3Dbooks%26store-name%3Dbooks/102-5443600-8270563" target="_blank">Deborah Tannen</a>, et al.] and I think many of the threads here quickly diverge from an environment where they care to participate.  <BR> <BR>I don't have a problem with exclusivity &ndash; you go, girls! I do hope, however, that from time to time you'll return to join the rest of us floundering plebes and share your wisdom. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I love what I'm hearing from Tiffany, Dyana, Kristin, and Kent!  There are some very important women's issues in typography and design, and there absolutely must be a forum in which women can freely discuss them.  <BR> <BR>I don't see this as being about divisiveness at all; rather, it's about women communicating with and assisting other women. And I think that, for this to work best, the Alphabetties forum has to provide for exchange among registered women users only. Whether men can lurk should, in my opinion, be entirely up to the Alphabetties. <BR> <BR>We're not going to lose Tiffany, Kristin, and Dyana; but there will be occasional moments when they will step out amongst themselves to chat. And when they do, let's not cry &quot;foul,&quot; but rather say instead, &quot;good for them!&quot; <BR> <BR>Jon <BR> <BR>P.S.

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, killer idea. Minorities naturally need to  bind together more. Majorities simply need to understand that, and not use it as a license to amplify their own exclusivity. Just make sure you don't get too cute or pink. Don't try to be &quot;as good as the boys, but different&quot; - be <i>girls</i> - leverage that to the max. <BR> <BR>BTW, if we ever have a Male-only type club, we should be called Finials. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
