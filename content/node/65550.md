  think they are spot on in their promotion and look and feel. Even if the imagery
  is a little 'Pret' styled. 7 out of 10 for  kARMARAMA \r\n\r\nUse of this typeface
  is what makes it for me..\r\n\r\nFind it here... http://www.costa.co.uk/  (actually
  not so keen on appearance on screen)\r\n\r\nbest use is in printed media see http://www.karmarama.com/casestudies/costa/default.aspx.\r\n\r\nor
  see attached file.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone can find it ..Thanks\r\n\r\nDavid_C"

  body: "Thanks. Note that Rosewood is a chromatic font and has been designed to complement
    the Fill version, for two-color printing. (So is Pepperwood and Zebrawood, too.)\r\nUsing
    it without its companion might be considered a bit, well, apish.\r\n\r\nSee this
