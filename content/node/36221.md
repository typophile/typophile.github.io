  we love the alternate flourishes it provides (besides it being a beautiful typeface).
  However, I'd like to know if there are any other typefaces out there that have lots
  of flourishes, etc that you can chose from similar to the way you can in Bickham
  Script. Does this make sense?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBethany"

  body: "Patty I recently got a license to Zapfino, the entire suite.* I have to say
    that the Zapfino we are sick of seeing \u2014 used inappropriately most of the
    time \u2014 is not the sum of the face. It really is beautiful and I'd love to
    see someone, besides Linotype, use it in a way that speaks to this beauty. \r\n\r\nThis
    is just in response to Patty and I'm not sure Zapfino could be a replacement for
    Bickham as they are two completely different script styles.\r\n\r\n*A preview
    only copy of the license I should add."
