  body: "If you mean the logo 'VISA', it looks like Myriad Bold Italic with a gold
    'wing' added to the V. It could be a number of sans serif faces, with that 'S'
    almost the only thing to use to make an ID.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It's <a href="http://typography.com/catalog/whitney/index.html">Whitney</a>,
    and it's not new. Their <em>Worldwide Association Report 2004</em> done in 2005
    uses it.
