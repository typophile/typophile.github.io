  body: "A bit of clarification here ...\r\n\r\nYour AKAs, Yves, are actually several
    slightly different fonts. All are based upon what were originally Filmotype faces.
    I'll give the original names in bold:\r\n\r\n<strong>Apache</strong> was digitized
    as your URW Apache and Panache's <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=stanley\"
    target=\"_blank\">Stanley</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>August</strong>, then, was a little
    heavier and wider. Fontbank's <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/toledo.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Toledo</a> (and Brendel's Cochise) are digital versions - and
    some version of August is what I think was used for your graphic, Roy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Beaver</strong>
    was still slightly heavier and wider. Sixpack was made from that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Avon</strong>
    and <strong>Parade</strong> were just plain different in lots of little ways.\r\n\r\nIf
    quality of digitization is a consideration, then keep in mind that the Fontbank
    and Brendel offerings were made way back in the earliest days of computer fontmaking.
    I can guarantee that the URW font is much better made. I don't know enough about
    Panache or have any of their fonts, so can't speak to the quality issue there."
