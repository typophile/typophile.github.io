body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hideko_typofile_4784.png]\r\nHideko is
  a visually unique font that has the essence of both serif and san-serif fonts through
  integrating the body structure of san-serif while retaining the calligraphy from
  serif. Hideko was inspired by synthesizing Japanese calligraphy and western letters.
  During the process of creating Hideko, I attempted to make a font only for oriental
  use, but the result is a font with versatile uses. This multicultural font is most
  effectively used for oriental restaurants but is also ideal for western cafes, posters,
  books, etc. Along with the cultural synthesis of Japanese and western letters, Hideko
  features various ligatures, stylistic alternates, fractions, and languages as well.\r\nHideko

  body: "There is a tradition of brush lettering in the West, and typefaces derived
    from such lettering.\r\nMaiandra and Baker Signet come to mind. Recently, Capucine.\r\nWestern
    \"brush\" types suggestive of Eastern culture: Papyrus, Hiroshige.\r\nAuriol was
    made in France at a time when there was a Japanese influence on art there, and,
    with its disconnected strokes, has more of the look of Japan\u2014at least, the
    clich\xE9d national image that exists in the West.\r\n\r\nAlthough this face doesn't
    overtly signify Japan, which would be unfortunate anyway, it could certainly be
    used for things Asian, and it would be good for \"organic\" uses too.\r\n"

  body: "Yes, Nick, I was about to say this would be a nice substitute for Maiandra,
    which may be a bit overused. Very legible for text, informal, graceful, just different
    enough to attract a closer look at the piece.\r\n\r\nI had a customer who unfortunately
    considered Comic Sans(!) her \"friendly signature font.\" With difficulty, I persuaded
    her to accept Maiandra for her trifold business advertisement (a Bed & Breakfast).
    Hideko would've worked well. Like you, I don't see it as particularly Asian. "

  body: "Thank you for the comments both of you. and yes, I actually agree with you
    guys about Hideko does not signify Japan well. I am from Japan, and I've been
    writing Japanese for more than 20 years, and I applied the stroke of Japanese
    letter, and especially at the end of the stroke. but when I made the font it has
    lack of legibility... so I took in more part of western letters in order to keep
    legibility.\r\nmaybe I should make true Japanized english word with Japanese calligraphy
    brush. Do you guys think it'll be demand for that kind font?\r\n"

  body: "Hideko reminds me of some Japanese faces I have seen, true, but also of a
    bouncier Fontin Sans with a touch of Optima. Calling it Japanised isn't that crazy.\r\n\r\nLooks
    pretty readable and universal to me. Would have been nice to see this in ads for
    the Suzuki Fox (the SJ410's Icelandic name)."

  body: I too enjoy the feeling of this, and I agree it seems to fill a useful and
    welcome niche (BTW, I also quite enjoy the detail of how the terminals are drawn).
    Meanwhile, I do have to say, and I'm sorry to be the partypooper here, but for
    it to be universally useful, I'd wish the spacing was less uneven than what it
    looks like from the previews.
