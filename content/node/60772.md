body: "On December 31, 2005, I drove from Dallas to New Orleans.  This was no run
  of the mill road trip.  I was on my way back home.  Hurricane Katrina damaged my
  house; the Federal Government destroyed my home.  During the eight-hour road trip,
  anxiety and anger overcame me.  To be honest, this rancid, emotional state had been
  pulsing through my veins for every second of every day since I found myself alone,
  stuck on this identical interstate in gridlock-traffic, evacuating from both the
  city that I live/loved/grew-up in and my family that stayed behind.\r\n\r\nMind
  racing\u2026.>\r\n\r\n\u2026What happened to my generation?  What happened to this
  country?  WHY ISN\u2019T ANYBODY DOING ANYTHING?  WHY DOESN\u2019T ANYBODY CARE?
  \ WHERE ARE ALL OF THE PROTESTS?  WHERE IS THE JUSTICE?\r\n\r\nAs if in a manic
  state, these questions repeated in my brain and the aggravation swelled to my limbs
  until I shook with anger.  My hands clung to the steering wheel.  My knuckles turned
  a severe shade of white.   I suddenly realized I was shouting out loud.  STOP!  I
  know what you are thinking\u2026 \u2018this girl must be crazy..she is talking to
  herself\u2026she definitely has lost IT.\u2019\r\n\r\nI am not really crazy, or
  at least completely.  (In New Orleans, multiple-personality disorder is not a disorder\u2026it
  is a high art.) There was actually another in the car.  A ghost.  A spirit.  A legend.\r\n\r\nHer
  name is Marie Laveau, the Voodoo Queen of New Orleans.  The spirit of Marie Laveau
  has followed me since I was a child.  She was the most infamous voodoo practitioners
  in the beginning of the movement from slavery practices in New Orleans to the high-era
  of the \u201Cfree people of color.\u201D  People visited Marie Laveau looking for
  spells to make someone fall in love, make a fortune, or even to kill a neighbor.
  \ This Voodoo Queen paraded through Congo Square, dancing to the Vodun rhythms and
  chanting spells.\r\n\r\nMarie Laveau became a household name.  Stories of her life
  are still told today.  What made this Voodoo Queen different from the many other
  Voodoo Queens is that she used her innate womanly power and charisma to influence
  an entire movement towards freedom and the empowerment of women in New Orleans.
  \ To me, she is an inspiration and a gift.  She taught me the invaluable lesson
  of how to influence others to bring about change.  Her medium was word of mouth.
  \ Her message was the strength of the media.\r\n\r\nIf old Marie Laveau could bring
  about such extreme changes in society, spark the popularization and development
  of jazz as a genre, and still have the ability to keep children behaved hundreds
  of years after her death by the threat of her spirit doing evil, I could at least
  do SOMETHING to influence at least one person to bring a change in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nI
  knew that if I was going to be in New Orleans, I would have to raise money for New
  Orleans by selling something that had the personality of New Orleanians and that
  would not be just another rubber-wristband with a fleur de lis.  I had to come up
  with something funny and even a little inappropriate because at the end of the day,
  New Orleanians will always make laughter through tears at inappropriate times because
  laughter is the best life raft.>\r\n\r\n\u201CIF THIS FEMA TRAILER IS\u2019 A ROCKING\u2026DON\u2019T
  COME\u2019 A KNOCKING!\u201D\r\n\r\nIn two weeks, I sold $13,xxx worth of buttons
  with this phrase.  I contacted a man named James Taylor who was in charge of actually
  purchasing materials to \u201Crepair\u201D the levee systems.  What did this buy?
  \ A pipe.  Not so great.  But was much more valuable and what needed to be repaired
  far more than the levees (they aren\u2019t even repaired anyway now!) was the laughter
  of New Orleanians.  For two years following the storm, I gave a button to anyone
  with tears in their eyes and of course\u2026at no charge.  These people were not
  hard to find.  With each button came a crack of laughter.\r\n\r\nMarie Laveau\u2019s
  legacy was the Voodoo Queen of New Orleans.  My legacy is \u201CThe Button Lady.\u201D
  \ I have arrived!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/funbutton_4944.jpg]"
