  a mark for an abstract strategy board game. The game is called Pivit, which references
  the game's basic mechanics\u2014upon making a move, the player's piece must be rotated,
  or pivoted, toward an opposing angle, which dictates the direction of their next
  move. \r\n\r\nI chose to draw the logotype as an ambigram because it reflects the
  game's distinguishing play characteristics, ie. the logo can rotate, just like the
  game pieces. But as I'm sure many of you know, ambigrams require skill and deep
  knowledge of typographic history to execute well. I feel like the basic shapes of
  the characters have been established, but I'm well aware that there is a level of
  finish currently missing in the attached comp. So I'm calling on my fellow type
  junkies to point out the flaws and opportunities you might recognize in the attached
  mark.\r\n\r\nThis project represents a leap in my knowledge of typography, and has
  made me realize just what a novice I really am. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.
  So please don't hold back.\r\n\r\n"

    does here. \r\n\r\nFrom a lettering standpoint, I think what you have is pretty
    great. From an overall composition, though, I think the rounded dots are distracting
    and don't fit in to the overall vibe of the letters which are much more blackletter.
    I'd suggest playing with some more wavy diamond-shaped forms for the dots. \r\n\r\nI'm
    also not sure a circle is the best form to lock it up with. Again, there's a bit
    of dissonance between the circle and the letterforms. \r\n\r\nOverall, though...nice
    work!"

  body: "Very nice, I agree.\r\n\r\nI think you could easily make the finial of the
    /t/ longer and more balanced without sacrificing the readability of the /p/."

  body: "I think the circle lends an appropriate sense of rotation. Should the dots
    be raised a little (in addition to experimenting with different shapes)? \r\nWill
    the word in a more legible lettering accompany the mark? This is brilliantly done,
    but in the end it's not really readable, especially given that the name (in this
    spelling) is a new word rather than something recognizable."

  body: One more thing - spacing. I think /pi/ and /vi/ (which of course is the same
    space, really) could come in a bit tighter.

  body: The horizontal stroke at the bottom of the bowl of the p (and the crossbar
    on the t, obviously) could be more balanced, like written with a broad-nibbed
    pen.

  body: This is brilliant! I wouldn't change a thing about it, but I think that somewhere
    in the identity of 'pivit', apart from the logo, you should make sure the name
    is easily legible.

  body: The tittles doesn't relate to the rest of the strokes. To me they looked like
    ornamentation. To increase legibility you might want to do a diamond tittle.

  body: After seeing your logo, I was surprised and appreciate your knowledge of typography
    and its difficult to point out the flaws. It was more than a professional design.
    I am interested in making a logo of [[http://www.bestessayservicereviews.com/|best
