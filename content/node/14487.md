  out West and yes the city in mind is of course San Francisco. It has been on the
  agenda for quite some time and now the timing is perfect. It won't be forever, but
  6 month will give me (and my family) the opportunity to experience daily life in
  this fantastic city. And since SF also is a good community regarding type design
  and graphic design, this will probably lead to new connections one way or the other.
  Already having some close friends there, I would still like to point out to all
  you other locals here on typophile, that I look forward to meet some new faces during
  my stay.\r\n\r\nCheers & long live San Francisco!"

    open to collaborate on typedesign with some local design companies. Please step
    forward \u2013 I'm all ears!\r\n\r\nSalute!"

    just as mean in our kind, "it's all good" way).

    to surround the Pentagon, hold hands, and raise it in the air. The East Coast
    contigent, led by Abbie Hoffman, looked at it as a great media event. The West

    live in New York, but leave before you become too hardened. And you should live
    in San Francisco but leave before you get too soft.\"\r\n\r\nI always thought
    that was about politics, which could be true. But after my return to NYC for [[TypeCon]],
    I think it's all about the weather.\r\n\r\nOne thing about New York though, to
    my relief I didn't see one pair of Birkenstocks or Doc Martens. SF could take
    a lesson from NYC in the shoe category. =)"
