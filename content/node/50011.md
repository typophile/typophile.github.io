  Conan Doyle</a> named his story <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em> after his
  compatriot John Baskerville's well-known and much-venerated typeface. In my current
  photo op, Boroondara Kew Cemetery, last week I stumbled across <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/arboghast/2898366374/\">what
  looks to be the grave of a Baskerville</a> who lived in the late 19th century, one
  George Baskerville.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/george_baskerville_4480.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  plan to go back this week and take loads more pix of George Baskervile's fallen
  tombstone. Many thanks to <strong>flickr</strong> pal <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-margie/\">Tom
  Margie</a> for noticing the name on the monument.\r\n\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
