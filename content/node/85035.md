  A - Specimen\">\r\n\r\nwww.evolette.26plus-zeichen.de \r\n\r\nAn interpretation
  of Art D\xE9co meets straight lined shapes of ancient runes \u2013 the experimental
  type design from Timo Titzmann and Jakob Runge is available right now. It goes hand
  in hand with a specimen fresh from the press.\r\n\r\nThe geometric constructed all-case
  grotesque comes along with two additional integrated extravagant stylistic sets
  for the whole alphabet and some astonishing special characters as well. The plain
  linear-antiqua with classical proportions offers numerous combination possibilities
  between the ordinary alphabet of TJ Evolette A and the two alternate alphabets.
  This variety encourages unusual and extroverted creation in editorial and poster
  design.\r\n\r\nThe font contains seven closely graded weights (form hairline to
  bold) to keep all options open while designing with the font. All common character
  sets of Central and Eastern European as well as Western Europe are supported. By
  Open Type features all 446 glyphs can be used optimally.\r\n\r\nOne weight http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/26plus/tj-evolette-a/light/
  TJ Evolette A is free for non-commercial usage or testing purposes. Moreover, the
  completely font family is available free of charge for student projects.\r\n\r\nThe
  specimen, printed monochrome on a Traditional Colour offset press, contains a 59,4
  \xD7 84,1 cm poster, which can be fold to a DIN A 4 booklet.\r\n\r\nFont styles:
  Hairline, Thin, ExtraLight, Light, Book, Normal, Bold\r\nDesigner: Timo Titzmann

  body: "Really lovely, Tiiimo. Very elegant proportions and some inspired alternate
    characters. Comment, if I may: it seems to me that as a family, it would benefit
    from one or two heavier weights. Something really substantial, to offset the lighter
    weights.\r\n\r\n(Love the specimen book, too ... )\r\n\r\nK."

  body: "Great!\r\nWe need more experiments, and this is very focused, unique, and
    typographically quite profound.\r\n\r\nBut I would have made one of the runic
    variants the default, not the plain sans, which is OK but not a particularly desirable
    typeface, given its lack of a lower case, and the number of well-established deco/geometric
    styles already available, many with greater weight range, as noted.\r\n\r\nI also
    wonder how much work typographers are prepared to do in playing around with inserting
    alternates manually.\r\nPerhaps a few more stylistic sets that offered settings
    somewhere between the two extremes.\r\n\r\nOK, make that a \"lightly spiced\"
    style as the default, with plain retro and total weirdness as the alternates?\r\nAfter
    all, that is the style you show on the specimen cover as representing the face.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I could be wrong, and your strategy of making the plain font free may be effective!"

  body: "thanks for your detailed comments!\r\nwe feel really honored.\r\n\r\nas you
    both mentioned, a bolder version for the typeface would be great. timo and me
    we started with the lighter weights to avoid problems in the nooks of the alternate
    letters, but anyway we have to find an solution for bolder weights :-)\r\n\r\nto
    nick shinn's position about mixing the alternate letters right into the plain
    appearance: this would be great \u2013 i agree, currently not every user now how
    to add alternates or has the tome to give his text an nice mixture of plain and
    alternate letters.\r\nWe are not so familiar with programming <em>faux randomism</em>
    to simulate an always unique mixture of the three alphabets.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "well, if you have <em>bought</em> this font, you should have \"tj evolette
    Light\", \"tj Evolette Hairline\" etc. \u2014 variants like \"TJEvoletteA-_ss1\",\"TJEvoletteA-_ss2\"
    and \"TJEvoletteA-_ss2\" are for our private process only (we use them at www.26plus-zeichen.de,
    because there are not much opentype features working for sure in the web. in this
    version the font-files are containing just one stylistic set, so just 1/3 of all
    glyphs, and they are named all equal. this might cause the problem.\r\nbut as
    already mentioned these files are not for sale \u2026\r\n\r\nif you have bought
    the normal TJ Evolette via Myfonts or YouWorkForThem, all alternative glyphs (ss0,
    ss1, und ss2) are included in one font file, like \"light\". so you do not have
    to install one weight tree times at once.\r\n\r\nfor me all features are working
    in photoshop-cs5 - but not as \"stylistic sets\", cause these can be interpreted
    by InDesign only \u2014 did you took a look on http://26plus-zeichen.de/wp-content/uploads/TJ-EvoletteA_how-to-use.pdf
    ? there it is explained how to the access to the different letters in the adobe
    creative suite.\r\n\r\n\r\nanyway you should send me your font files, so i can
    may solve the problem.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\n   jakob"
