  body: "Six hours & no pronouncement from the true font cognescenti! \r\nDespite
    the fuzzy image, I can see a regularity in the lower case that suggests that this
    is could well be a font -- although some of the old time letterers were pretty
    consistent. The lowercase scripting is open and conventional with high legibility.
    But the uppercase of slanted plain letters, at least for the WNOT shown is unusual.\r\nIt
    would help if you could provide some information as to the source of the image,
    particularly the approximate year, or decade, in which it was originally created,
    and the country where it appeared. Wild guess, based on the text of the image,
    your explanation,  & profile info, WWII RCAF in England? But then again, I could
    be completely off base & this is a brand new font created by one of the up and
    coming foundaries.\r\nDon\r\n "

    simply go with the most similar that I find."

  body: "Ok. Then consider using two fonts. A plain sloped lettering for the uppercase
    and a high legibility script for the lower case, e.g. a school script. Should
    work fairly well.\r\nDon"

  body: "For lowercase you might be happy with Billy Argel's <a href=\"http://billyargelfonts.blogspot.ca/2011/05/billy-argel-blessed-day-font.html\">Blessed
    Day</a>. Far from a perfect match, but the ascenders & descenders generally fit
    the sample's form and length, the weight and slope are about right, and most of
    the letters are not too far off the sample's cursive.\r\nDon "

    upper & lower case that come close! It's the Filmotype Lucky, a fairly low contrast
    script like the request image, released on MyFonts last month.\r\nDon"
