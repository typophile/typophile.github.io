  part of a Visual Communication/International Studies double degree, and have been
  living & studying in Bordeaux, France for the past 9 months or so.\r\n\r\nThe deadline
  for my final research project -- a 5000-word research project on an aspect of France
  or French society, of your choosing -- is a few months away now, and what I've decided
  to do is explore/investigate the links between traditional Basque lettering styles
  \ (mentioned <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19079\">here</a> on Typophile,
  and here's a <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/neregauzak/5738933/\">cursory</a>
  <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/neregauzak/5768745/\">flickr</a> <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/adamrice/272394970/\">search</a>)
  and concepts of Basque nationalism.\r\n\r\nWhile there's a wealth of stuff on Basque
  identity and nationalism in its various guises, I've struggled to find information
  on the Basque lettering/type in journal databases and magazine archives and <a href=\"http://backspace.com/notes/2004/10/10/x.html\">this
  post on Social Design Notes</a> was almost all Google would give me). So if anyone
  could point me in the direction of books, journal articles, or even people that
  might be able to shed some light on this, that would be great. I'm open to resources
  in French and English (and I have some <i>very</i> basic Spanish).\r\n\r\nAnd an
  aside, while I've got you here:\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to maybe do a few comparisons
  -- any tips on other contemporary or historical connections between type and national
  identity? I ordered a copy of Shaw & Bain's \"Blackletter: Type and National Identity\"
  the other day -- a contemporary Basque country/WWII Germany comparison seems like
  it could be quite interesting both visually and ideologically, but off the top of
  my head that's all I've got so far, and it's been written about so many times before
  in theses etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway. This is getting a little longwinded. Love to hear
  your thoughts/ideas!\r\nAnd I've attached one of the flickr photos I linked to above,
  just in case you're unfamiliar with the style (although there can be quite a bit
  of variation).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/272394970_e9bad05ed9_3941.jpg]"

    properly. Contrasting with the way Uncial type is used to denote Irishness might
    be more apropriate? The bonus would be the research involving various Irish pubs
    in your area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and the Gaelic script (more than the uncial style of the Latin script). BTW, I
    remember one or two other cases of discussion concerning Basque lettering on Typophile,
    but can't find them.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I might try and get in touch with the guy who runs that site.\r\n\r\nHrant & Sii,
    I think you're both right here: the Germany/blackletter thing was just the first
    thing that came to mind when I started thinking about type & nationalism. I might
    still mention it in passing though.\r\n\r\nThe Uncial/Gaelic script options do
    seem like better ideas.\r\n\r\nWondering though: has a lot been written on Gaelic
    script? This could turn very niche very quickly -- especially since I'm writing
    this for an arts/sociology-type degree, not my design one. Also wondering if the
    political associations are as strong here? This is all pretty uncharted territory
    for me.\r\n\r\nAll this said, I'm not sure how big the \"comparative\" part of
    my piece is going to be, given that the whole thing is relatively short."
