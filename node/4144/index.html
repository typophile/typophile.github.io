  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The Asian Art Museum in San Francisco is publishing a major catalogue of classic Thai art from the former kingdom of Ayutthaya, to be called The Kingdom of Siam. The desire is for the catalogue to reflect the style of earlier Western writings from around 1700 (in other words, around the time of the Romain du roi and early Franco-Dutch typography). A sample page of one of the models is provided. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The typeface must also accommodate Thai diacritics, which have a couple of peculiarities, notably a backwards cedilla that has to combine with a macron, and a breve-like finishing stroke to some of the glyphs, which also must combine with a macron. I will upload funky approximations of these from a poor-quality source. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm prepared to create the special characters if I have to, but I would prefer to find an existing typeface that meets the project needs. To further complicate things, all of my work is postscript but some people need to work with the diacritics on non-postscript Windows machines. Maybe open type is a way around this? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any suggestions much appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for teaching me the word <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ogonek.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I will be sure to use it soon! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course Thai has its own script but it also has a romanization system, which uses the special marks I described among others. We mainly need these to render titles in the bibliography, where I guess they are critical. We are using the system approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library Association and published in a document imaginatively titled ALA-LC Romanization Tables. Following up on Hrant's suggestion I looked on-line for this and found it here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/thai.pdf">http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/thai.pdf</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree about the sample. I considered Adobe Garamond and may still go with it, since we already own that font, but was afraid it wouldn't read as having the archaic quality that is being looked for. Also, this is only one of several model texts, and others are more RdR or Dutch in flavor than this one is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could afford to commission a special face! I doubt that would be within our budget, however (not having any real idea what it would cost). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for your help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been peeking around typophile for a long while, basically since I started having an interest in typography (was it typography?) when I was looking/learing how to make my thesis, report, and slide presentation look more interesting. I got bored with Knuth's Computer modern, Times with MathTimes, and Lucida with LucidaNewMaths on a standard TeX system. There are not many choices there for mathematical oriented typography: Adobe just ditched a mac support for FrameMaker; hopefully, InDesign will have a built-in functionality to typeset mathematics and long documents to the level of previous FrameMaker. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the font &ndash; I don't have any training in type design at all &ndash; the first line looks nice; it probably is a bold/black weight of a text face. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The eyes of &amp;#3648;, &amp;#3604;, look optically imbalance, not sure why though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the second line, I have seen this type of   typeface used often in a magazine.

IIRC, it looks similar to one that Microsoft includes in their OS. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I notice some spacing problems here &ndash; un-even spacing; I don't know how to solve it from the font perspective without hacking into the algorithm of the text setting software though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chanop</div>

Too romanized (e.g., 5th consonant, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ro rua<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is too much like an 's'.).

Even for running copy at small sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lines 3-4: The Latin is too heavy. Arabic numerals are too heavy and too tall.

While it might look like the left bearings on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sara o<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sar ai<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are too big, that's what I usually see. And what usually seems to be accepted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although, as I mentioned, all the head (loops) that make a face 'look Thai', they seem to hinder efficient reading.

Let's say we have a typical Latin face at 1000 emsq design size (Type 1); Caps hight is ~700, x-height ~450, and the length from the highest point to the lowest point (ascender-descender) is within 1000. To match this face with Thai alphabet that has a regular height between Caps and x height, let's assume it to be 550-600. That is fine until we look at some characters like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sara o, sara i, sara u, tonal marks,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and etc. When we combine the total design size from the top to the bottom, it goes well beyond 1000, quite ofen 1300-1500. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is there any real specification for this issue? Thomas? I have looked into Adobe Type 1 spec book, but found no concrete answer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TrueType Font distributed with Microsoft OS tend to reduce the size of Latin alphabet; the exception probably is Tahoma which is designed for screen reading.

Besides, the stroke weight of Thai alphabets does not quite match the weight of   the Latin ones, especially the bold weight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let's see how I can post the image&hellip;.

About 60 years after the end of the Ayutthaya period. Before that every book used the romanization scheme you've got.

So now Angsana is Angsana New. As are all the Thai fonts in the OS. Although, perhaps the UPC versions are still used in Thailand.</div>

Chanop asked: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is trere any other Thai romanisation standard around?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is also an ISO standard for Thai romanisation, ISO/FDIS 11940, but I have not examined it because ISO want me to pay 79 Swiss francs for the privilege. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding combining Latin and Thai in a single font, it is necessary to reduce the size of the Latin considerably if you want to balance it to the Thai and still allow adequate vertical space for the latter in the body height. Quite apart from the tall Thai glyphs, including three frequently occuring tall vowels, there are vowel and tone mark stacks to be accounted for, although the taller of these can reasonably extend beyond the body height. When working on a new Thai design, Fiona Ross, Tim Holloway and I examined a number of bilingual publications to get a sense of the conventional relative height and weight proportions of Latin and Thai when used together, and to see what works best. Sorry I can't show the result yet; suffice to say that I can confirm Chanop's observation that 'bo-height &hellip; should be somewhere between x-height and caps-height'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had no idea Nathan was into Thai type.

		<div class="commentbody">Chanop: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only tone marks can double up, sometimes we have multiple slots for the same glyph (think Type 1), in order to accomodate the typograpical need i.e. top vowels have two variants: a normal position and a left-shifted position for letters like BB, BD, and BF; tonal marks have four variants, a normal position for combining with the top vowels , a lower position when combined with the normal consonants, and two left-shifted position.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tone marks used in stacks are traditionally made slightly smaller than those used directly above a letter. This both saves vertical space and ensures that the whole combination does not become top heavy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even when using something like the OpenType GPOS &lt;mkmk&gt; feature to build stacks, rather than having multiple non-spacing characters at different heights, a well made font will include these small tone mark variants that will be contextually substituted when preceded by a vowel mark. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is it offensive to move the second (higher) mark to the left of the first one, to save vertical space?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Questioning whether such a thing is offensive only addresses its acceptability to native readers, whose acceptance or rejection <!-- raw HTML omitted -->may<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be conventional. More interesting is to ask whether such an innovation is actually useful, and whether it makes sense within the structure of the writing system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The answer to the question 'Is it actually useful?' has to be no. Apart from a small number of what may be termed double-width letters, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tho phuthao<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no nen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the Thai letters are not wide enough for diagonal left+down shifting of a stacked tone mark to reduce the total height: there simply isn't enough space in which to lower the mark. If you look at the first two pairs of letters in the example above, which are typical of the majority of Thai letters, it is clear that the vowel mark occupies most of the width of the letter. Even if one were to shift and lower the stacked tone mark on the wider letters, the total height required for stacked marks is necessarily determined by the narrowest base letter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also think your suggestion does not make sense within the organisational structure of the Thai writing system. If you look through the Font Book PDF that Chanop provided, you'll see that a lot of consideration is given to correct horizontal alignment of marks to letters (see pages 61-79). There is very clearly a correct way to position marks, which is relative to the right-side vertical stroke of the base letter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The most common element in Thai text is a vertically organised grapheme consisting of a letter, a letter + vowel, a letter + tone, or letter + vowel + tone (some letters may also take modifier subscript marks). Because the 'sub-atomic' elements of the grapheme are arranged vertically, the verticality of the grapheme becomes an important structural concern. The verticality of the grapheme is established by the right-side vertical stroke of the letters, which is a feature common to all Thai letters: there are some letters that have no left-side vertical, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ngo ngu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wo waen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but there are no letters that do not have a definite vertical stroke on the right side, even if some of these strokes do not ascend to the 'bo-height', e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ro rua<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and in some letters elements, such as loops or flourishes, may extend horizontally beyond the right-side vertical, e.g. the loop in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no nen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in some styles and the tail of the ring in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so rusi.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In order to maintain the verticality of the grapheme, marks above and below the base letter are aligned relative to the right-side vertical stroke. The only time they are shifted to the left is for the tall letters, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fo fa<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in which the right-side vertical itself rises above the bo-height. It is worth noting that when a tall vowel such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sara o<!-- raw HTML omitted --> follows a letter with a mark or mark stack above, it is the tall vowel that is letter-spaced (positive kerned) to avoid a collision with the mark(s): the marks are not shifted to the left to avoid the collision, because this would disrupt the verticality of the grapheme. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One might ask, why is the verticality of graphemes important? Why is it a strictly maintained aspect of the Thai script? I suspect it is a response to the Thai orthography and, in particular, to the length of visually unbroken strings of words making up phrases. Apart from light kerning to reduce white space caused by some combinations of letters, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no nen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> followed by &lt;/i&gt;cho chan&lt;/i&gt; in styles where the lower right loop on the first letter extends beyond the right-side vertical, well-typeset Thai text consists of discreet, vertically arranged graphemic units that do not interact horizontally with their neighbours. This makes a lot of sense in terms of clarity when one looks at the long strings of such graphemes between phrase breaks. The verticality of the graphemes is an aid to breaking these long phrases into words, by preventing horizontal interaction across what may be word boundaries. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;about the DC character: why is it missing from the Unicode Thai encoding?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The zero-width space is not specific to Thai, so Unicode encodes only one, U+200B, which is used by various scripts and mapped to the appropriate decimal codepoint in 8-bit codepages.</div>

If Thai people really don't have much of a problem with hyper-Latinized fonts, I think they might be able to handle some shifting accents too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But to some extent you have to choose your target. And as with any culturally progressive effort, it makes more sense to target the natives and not the learners - for the latter one should just use the &quot;normal&quot; fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, different scripts have different proportions of people learning (and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->needing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to learn) versus natives simply reading. For a script like Thai (and unlike English) which might need to provide for its natives more than learners, a progressive approach makes more sense (as long as there's no strong threat of assimilation) than it would elsewhere. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; More interesting is to ask whether such an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; innovation is actually useful, and whether <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; it makes sense within the structure of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; writing system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, of course that has to be established first - otherwise it's just change for its own sake, which I tend to see as a sort of hooliganism. The advantage of taming the vertical span of Thai is obvious: it allows for a better balance of apparent size and economy. Your issue of Thai letters &quot;not being wide enough&quot; I think is not only secondary, but possibly even a reason to explore improved readability through the introduction of greater width (especially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->variability<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of width) into the script! Or maybe you could vary the sizes of the accents (which you're doing anyway) - this size variation might even introduce more room to improve readability (in the way Hangul does). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are many avenues to improving any script - you have to think from outside in, because that's where true functionality (as opposed to merely following potentially half-baked rules) comes from. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There's also another -probably more practical- advantage to taming the height: the need to reduce matching Latin (and other) fonts in size would be made less important. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basically the way in which Thai is using the Cartesian space is somewhat inefficient: the extreme vertical spikes in a body that's mostly of uniform height throws a wrench in leading, hence economy. Imagine writing English where just the &quot;h&quot; goes up to double its height. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; There is very clearly a correct way to position marks <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the ever-present question in writing reform is exactly this: what is &quot;correct&quot;, to whom? Is what's correct to a writing scholar correct to the layman reader? Not as a rule, no. Some people think there's only a certain way a Latin &quot;r&quot; can be correct, but when you corner them they have no real defense of their position. And you know what I think about them&hellip;  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->People -especially as they get older- tend to like to apply what they know, instead of keeping an open mind. This is especially true in a craft, where there's constant pressure to simply and quickly produce more instances of something that works OK.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, just to clarify: when I talk about Thai type I am expressing things that I have learned and ideas that I have developed in the process of working on Thai type design with experienced colleagues. I don't claim any great expertise in Thai, but my thoughts are grounded in the practical experience of making a typeface that has been described as 'extremely readable' by a fluent reader and expert in the Thai script. I mention this because, in your enthusiasm, you sometimes seems to assume that other people are beginning from the same level of ignorance or knowledge as you, and proceeding on the same theoretical and imaginatice basis. I think this can be a problem in our discussions, because I'm almost always commenting only from direct experience. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, your comments regarding the different sensibilities of natives versus learners are not at all in line with my experience in working with a number of scripts. Very often, I find I am much more concerned about the cultural authenticity of a design than native readers are, many of whom have grown up in a period of debasement of their national typography due to technical limitations, influence of outside fashions, or cultural uncertainty, and who may accept as normal things that are actually alien to or at best uncharacteristic of the longer traditions of their script. Unless they are themselves type designers, and working outside of contemporary fashions in graphic design, native readers are unlikely to do much research into such traditions, and so remain ignorant of what might be termed deep authenticity. I am not speaking here specifically about Thai; indeed, apart from some deplorable, latinising fashions in display type, Thai typography is in relatively good shape. But your generalisation regarding learners being unable to discern cultural authenticity does not seem to me to hold true. Cultural authenticity is something that can be apprehended from knowledge of a writing system and its development; natives and learners alike need to learn this, and can. This is not to deny that there are very insensitive non-native type designers making a hash of various scripts (there are also native designers doing the same thing), but they're just not doing a good job; they are, in fact, neither natives nor learners: they are not bothering to learn.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, of course I don't assume everybody knows as little as I do about Thai! But I do believe that different approaches and requirements allow for different types of &quot;solutions&quot;. You generally make highly-usable fonts that &quot;distill&quot; conventional ideas into a highly polished -and not unoriginal- whole. That's very useful, no doubt about it. But then there's a parallel need to always doubt existing practice, to revert to the true nature of functionality and try to rebuild/redirect a script. Of course tradition is part of that functionality, but the lines you cross will depend very much on your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intentions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For example, I think this is why you advocate breaking the Latin x-height bounds for Hebrew (which has varied conventions in that respect), but not for Cyrillic (because virtually no other type designers do it). Following the expectations of other type designers (and really not much anybody else, as far as I'm concerned) helps ensure greater adoption of your designs. If you made a Cyrillic font with an &quot;x-height&quot; greater than the one in the/a corresponding Latin font (clearly a much better solution for the Cyrillic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->user<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), the General would not be pleased, and the Bee would give you no honey!  :-) But I do hope that soon will find yourself in a position to innovate more. Admittedly (assuming one has the patience) first establishing a reputation for solid conventional design might help more people eventually accept one's innovations, but many designers do seem to get stuck in a rut, never leaving the comfy (and materially more rewarding) practice of simply giving people what they're used to. I really really wish Slimbach for example would start leveraging his commanding position to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->push<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at least just a little bit, already. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for your point about the types of sensibilities of different groups, I think you have to note how exceptional you are! Certainly, proportionally more non-native than native type designers have insufficient respect for a given script. I remember asking a few attendees of the Greek conference in 2002 what they thought of the current state of Greek type, and virtually all them disliked it as being inauthentic. Also, when you say that the average layman doesn't do any &quot;research&quot;, you're right, but he doesn't need to! The point is that his sensibilities are built implicitly over time; he doesn't need to know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that second line in my sample is problematic to simply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it is. This is the difference between pleasing other designers versus the -more important- users. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, I think this is why you advocate breaking the Latin x-height bounds for Hebrew (which has varied conventions in that respect), but not for Cyrillic (because virtually no other type designers do it).<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are mischaracterising my reasons for harmonising features of the Cyrillic and Latin scripts. I have explained, at length, that within the specific sub-genres of post-Petrine text types in which I have worked to date, the Latin and Cyrillic scripts are historical and natural cognates. You can reject that style if you want, but the harmonisation with Latin is a feature of that style and has been for 250 years. If I were designing Cyrillic type in a different style, e.g. one of the Old Church Slavonic styles, I would not feel any need to harmonise x-height or any other feature to Latin, even if the font were to contain both scripts. Similarly, I can imagine new Cyrillic styles that would not naturally harmonise with Latin, but I'd rather leave these developments to the Slavs: I am in every sense a 'learner', and don't think it is my position to teach <!-- raw HTML omitted -->except<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when my work uncovers authentic but neglected traditions that contemporary practitioners are ignorant of. One might put it this way: you seemingly never met a writing system that you didn't think you couldn't improve; I never met a writing system that I didn't think could improve me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, when designing Hebrew type my choice about whether to align the head to the Latin x-height depends on the intended use of the font. I do prefer to make the Hebrew taller, and am happy that this convention is most common in Biblical scholarship, but when designing bi-scriptal fonts for modern office use in Israel I will align the heights, because this has become the prevailing convention in that setting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding Greek, I think you should ask non-Greek type designers who work with Greek what they think of the current state of Greek type design. I think you will find that most of them are very much aware of the issue of authenticity, and tend to be much more concerned about it than the average Greek graphic designer or typographer, who are the people responsible for the use of inauthentic, latinised types. I recall that your visit to the conference was fleeting, and that you missed much of the most interesting stuff. Were you there for the raucous open forum at the end, when Jean-Fran</div>

Furthermore there are two aspects to what I'm saying, and you shouldn't bundle them: one is indeed script reform (like moving Thai accents around), while the other is clearly within the context of type design (like making the Cyrillic &quot;x-height&quot; bigger than the Latin). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding Greek: yes, you have a point. But overall it's pretty obvious that non-natives generally care less than natives. This is common sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thomas, you probably weren't asking me, but: I find that the Paratype Cyrillics are the same as most any other Cyrillics: way too harmonized on the superficial level, but as a result discordant on the true functional level - the bane of Modernism in fact.

In the case of Cyrillic and Latin, these are have developed side-by-side since the 18th Century: this is the post-Petrine norm. There is a Latin letter a and a Cyrillic letter a: and in the post=Petrine styles they are the same form, weight and size. The fact is that, for better or for worse, the Petrine Civil Type was specifically designed to harmonise Cyrillic and Latin in this way: i.e. to make the same use of Cartesian space. This is the point at which I enter Cyrillic type design, with 250 years of dominance of this particular style, and with customers who want to pay me to develop useable, readable typefaces that conform to accepted norms for the script. Within this framework, I will make recommendations against prevailing norms <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they are demonstrably contrary to the authentic development of the script within that culture. Quite apart from the longevity of the post-Petrine style, though, one has to see that 18th Century innovation in the context of a changing but still specifically Russian culture and its involvement with a larger European culture.</div>

This is important because the visual information conveyed by text (and expected by the reader) is totally dependent on how often ascenders and descenders pop up for example - and of course Latin and Cyrillic are very different in this respect**. This is in fact why the problem with a congruent x-height comes up: because Cyrillic uses the ascender and descender space far less, it ends up having a smaller apparent size (same as in Thai, like Chanop pointed out). And in the case of a book in both languages for example, this will cause the Russian setting to look &quot;less important&quot; - which is clearly more of a problem than lack of geometric congruence at the mico level (something only designers notice anyway). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Although even in the formal realm (not to mention the practical, &quot;user&quot; realm) it does seem problematic.

Although the sample I showed was Garamond or something like it, there are also examples of early English printing that are in the general spirit we want to evoke, and I am tending more in that direction. This is black and white but the actual page will use color: the word SIAM maybe in a burgundy red and the fleurons in a very faint blue perhaps &hellip; or possibly the whole thing will continue to evolve. (&quot;SIAM&quot; is a little faint here because it was in color.) I've never used fleurons like this before, and they're a bit in your face; my plan is to tint them back to where they're barely visible. Not sure the best treatment for the rules.

If either the top or the bottom accents were very rare, there would be less of a problem - because you can never <!-- raw HTML omitted -->totally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> avoid collisions (unless economy is a non-issue). Think of the accented caps in Latin. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I guess it's a matter of thresholds, and an accent would have to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rare to be safely ignorable. Looking at the frequencies, mai_han-akat/mai_tho isn't rare enough either, so fooling only with the sara_ii/sara_uee might be pointless.

If you work your way down and start fooling with the worst cases first, and eventually stop at a good threshold, you can gain some room.

I certainly understand that there's an issue with apparent size versus vertical span limits (which is why some people scale down the Latin part of a Thai/Latin system), but making the Thai bo-height match the Latin x-height sacrifices functionality for no good reason. On the other hand maybe you're saying that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->system<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (or &quot;UI&quot;) fonts have to be set flush (no leading), so I guess it's a special problem.

		<div class="commentbody">The current MS Thai engine (Office 2003), handles this glyph substitution in two ways, either by doing a buffered character substitution to the PUA codepoint or by applying OpenType Layout features. The latter is preferable; also one can use OpenType for additional substitutions, not handled on a character-to-PUA basis by the basic engine (e.g. ligation of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->po pla<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mai han-akat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and substitution of small stacking forms for tone marks). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The kind of buffered character substitution used in the older approach is the most benign kind of PUA use &ndash; certainly much better than actually using PUA characters in the text stream &ndash;, but it is still reliant on wholly private agreement about which PUA codepoints to use.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t offer much help with AFDKO syntax: I do all my OTL work in VOLT. But if AFKDO follows the font table structure in this regard, the process marks flag would be inclusive, rather than exclusive, i.e. you define a group of marks that you want to be processed, not to be ignored. So, for example, I define a group of &lsquo;above_marks_main&rsquo;, which includes only the full-size vowel and tone marks that apply directly to the base letter, and not the small variant tone marks that would sit above the main marks.</p>
<p>I apply the kerning between tall vowels and preceding marks as a DX and Width adjustment to the second glyph, i.e. to the tall vowel, rather than as a width adjustment to the mark glyph. Windows likes glyphs classified as marks to be zero-width, and while it is possible to use a separate GPOS lookup to give width to individual mark glyphs, in pair positioning adjustments they should remain zero-width. This is how it looks in VOLT:
