  of a museum in Belgium that opens September 27. On a window I've set an \"In Memoriam\"
  in Plantin MT Pro, which is the font that is used troughout the entire museum.\r\n\r\nNow,
  this \"in memoriam\" will be placed in lettering. My printer says that the serifs
  are to small and the letters might peel off. Can you recommend me a certain font
  style of Plantin with thicker serifs or a alternative sans serif that fits well
  with the look of Plantin? I'd rather not use an extra font, but if it's the only
  way... :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nJeroen Migneaux"

    applied to the window, or are you silk screening onto the glass?\r\n\r\nPlantin
    SemiBold may be a solution.\r\n\r\nAs for a sans serif to pair with Plantin, Monocle
    magazine uses Plantin and Helvetica together:\r\nhttp://fontfeed.com/archives/in-use-plantin-for-monocle/\r\n\r\nBut
    if Helvetica is just too overdone for you, I'd choose something with a tall x-height
    and a bit narrow (like Plantin), say Avenir or Telefon. I've even seen it paired
    nicely with Tempo, Frutiger, and Neutraface. "

  body: "Hi, thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nThe text will be cut in vinyl and applied
    to the windows. \r\n\r\nI'll send an example with Plantin SemiBold to my printer
    and see what they'll say. \r\n\r\nI really love the pairing Plantin/Helvetica
    in Monocle, but for this \"In Memoriam\" I need something elegant. Helvetica won't
    do the trick here. :(\r\n\r\nI'll check out Tempo. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
