body: "Gentle forum-goers, presented here is the first rendition of a future typeface.\r\n\r\nI
  have never designed a font before, so these humble trials are unlikely to receive
  anything but righteous scorns from seasoned and experienced typographers. Still,
  I feel that this task might be a good learning experience.\r\n\r\nTo make things
  easier, I decided to settle on an orderly geometric san-serif display face, largely
  composed of simple repeating elements, and a slight nostalgic quirkiness. I'll try
  posting the scans of the original sketches when I get home.\r\n\r\nWhat is the intended
  purpose of this face? Aside from practice, I was thinking about a unique display
  font to be used in the title of a hypothetical magazine dealing with computer history
  and retro-gaming. But that was just to give myself some kind of a direction, as
  I don't think this font would ever see the light of day.\r\n\r\nI am treading in
  uncharted (for me) waters, so I'll greatly appreciate any critiques and suggestions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oxfordhire_4419.gif]"

  body: "Is there any specific purpose of having the strokes monolinear_? \r\nYour
    horizontals must be a little thinner than the vertical strokes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I
    found \"s\" and \"r\" a bit problematic. \r\n\r\n"

  body: 'OPen up the spaces between the Glyphs. That way you can design it to work
    in more that one way. The openess of the counters and the tight spaceing don''t
    seem to go together to me eye. Also, making your face geometric doesn''t absolve
    you of needing to compensate ( in non-geometric ways ) for the needs of the eye.
    This means tapering joins. It can still appear geometric. But this way it will
    look less clunky. Look at the join on the r. I would open up the mouth of the
    e. Make the D wider. Consider what widths look best for each letter. This isn''t
    a monospace so take advantage. A full character set would help too. '

    managed to give this face its own personality. Keep at it.\r\n\r\nYour rounds
    overshoot the baseline a little too much, I think."

  body: "There's too much re-using of common elements, and you should pay some more
    attention to the way the curves turn into straights \u2014 that oughta be more
    flowing.\r\nOther points that needs attention are the overall rhythm (relationships
    in widths of the glyphs) and the balance of outer and inner spaces (ideally the
    inner space of o should be equal to what's between two o's, but also in line with
    the innerspace of an m, for instance).\r\nLook for balance.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert
