<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Well you learn something <a href=http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/cronos.html>new</a> every day. <br> <br>To me, Cronos looks substantially different to Today Sans, unmistakably a Slimbach design (check out the lower counter of the 'g', similar to his Garamond, Warnock and Minion). The angled brushed-like ends of strokes, stronger modulation of stroke width, and abscence of annoying ink traps make Cronos the superior of the two in my book, and set it far enough apart to clear it of the above-linked charges.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think Cronos is different enough to make it too small of a fish to fry - there are some narwhals out there. But it does have some telltale signs of <i>structural</i> plagiarism, and it would have been nice if they would just give due credit. That's all. <br> <br>> annoying ink traps <br> <br>TodaySans's ink traps are pretty subtle, and this benefits any text face. Looking at a text face at 200 pt is something a <i>reader</i> would never do. Don't believe those who say traps are unnecessary. All the <i>really</i> good designers use them (when needed). Not using them might be economically smart for certain markets (in the same way I think making smallcaps is largely pointless for most users, economically), but never technically so. <br> <br>> superior <br> <br>I think in a vacuum Cronos could be seen as superior. Certainly its MM axes make (or used to make) it more versatile. But it is also less pure, and less original - less culturally significant. Which is what people remember. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I was browsing at a magazine store yesterday, and I saw Cronos used in Mac Design as a text face. The display face is Trebuchet... Cronos reads really well as a text face, owing to its 'humanist' characteristics (!). Cronos is also used for the brochure the publishing courses at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. <br> <br>Cronos does work quite well with other Simbach's types. For my slab-serif paper I used Warnock with it. I got the Type Classics for Learning pack while I was still a student. It's terribly good value for some excellent types. A great way for a student to start up a really useful type library. <br> <br>Never thought Todays Sans was the source for Cronos, but now that you've mentioned it, I do see the similarities. Hrant: just how does one measure the 'cultural significance' of a typeface? I think it would probably take years for any type to become 'culturally significant'... Cronos is still pretty young. So Todays Sans is culturally significant you say? Didn't realize that...</div>

<div class=commentbody>> just how does one measure the 'cultural significance' of a typeface? <br> <br>Who knows! <br>But I would say that innovation is the main ingredient, although it does have to be tempered with usability, because real-world usage -hence exposure- is very important in type culture. <br> <br>My opinions on Today-Sans are frankly derived in large part from those of Bill Troop (who tends to get very passionate about plagiarism, especially the covert kind). Although my own historical insight is limited, I do see certain innovative traits, and in combination they make Today-Sans highly unique. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>But I would say that innovation is the main ingredient...</i> <br> <br>That's a Romantic view of culture. Without denying the role and importance of innovation, and the kind of individual genius that usually produces it, a Classical view would reject the idea that such innovation is the main ingredient. Rather the aggregate of human activity defines culture, and the most important element is not innovation but tradition, not individual genius but collective engagement (civitas). As Ezra Pound said, in a rare moment of lucidity, 'Civilisation is not a one man job'. <br> <br>I don't think it is possible to describe a typeface as 'culturally significant' if no one is using it. And, yes, this does mean that Arial is a culturally significant typeface, proving that not all culture is good culture and that culture can exist because of commercial or technological accident rather than creative inspiration.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the aggregate of human activity defines culture <br> <br>Agreed. I guess I meant significant in terms of cultural <i>progress</i>. <br> <br>Usage: again, agreed. But if let's say Today-Sans and Cronos are about equally [under]used, and the latter is largely inspired from the former, than the former would be more significant. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

Ideas are not copywritable, only the embodyment of them. If Cronos uses ideas from TodaySans, but embodies them in a significantly different way, then it deserves the copywrite it got." <br> <br>Well say! <br> <br> <br>Please Hrant, stop follow all the time, some statements about Cronos, who are definitely built to make a mix up of the reality.

<div class=commentbody>>It took me little time to type up "Or its original source, TodaySans." and hit the button. <br> <br>Ah, yes, hitting the button is easy. But there is more than one ethical issue here. <br> <br>One is the question you consider: proper acknowledgement of inspiration for your work. When and where should you do this? I think it should be done, but if it has been, then repeating it in advertising material it seems to me is asking too much. <br> <br>The other ethical issue is: when it is legitimate to disparage another person's character? This is regarded as a grave sin in both Buddhist and Rabbinic ethics, even when what you are saying is true. In Rabbinic ethics, it is especially a problem when a person's professional reputation is being potentially stained. There are, however, occassions on which a compelling reason overrides this prohibition, such as that another person will be cheated if you don't speak, or a serious injustice will be perpetuated. <br> <br>Ethically, people are really in a different category than typefaces when it comes to criticism. </div>

<div class=commentbody>> repeating it in advertising material it seems to me is asking too much. <br> <br>I agree. <br>I don't think there can be a strict threshold, but certainly in any material of more than two or three paragraphs any strong inspirational sources should be mentioned. <br> <br>> This is regarded as a grave sin in both Buddhist and Rabbinic ethics <br> <br>Fortunately my religion is Fairness. <br>And I have a particular disregard for the "professional" aspect you cite. <br> <br>Anyway, I don't think it's a "serious injustice" (Bill Troop does, and he's supposedly considering setting up a website about type design plagiarism).

No? <br> <br>And as, from the first day I looked at these two fonts, there is NO relationship between them. I see more relation between Today and Syntax than in Chronos and Today. I see more relationship between Chronos and all other Slimbach typefaces than any others. Just look at the figures structure in Adobe Garamond and Chronos. Same applies with his Minion compared to Chronos. <br> <br>That it, its a plain Slimbach typeface. Chronos is not a first type attempt from a young guy, it came after already many very good key typefaces. I really don't understand why a guy like Slimbach will lost his time to make a copy of Today, when he have the skills he have. Designing a typeface from scratch for Slimbach is matter of minutes, hours for a quite perfect result (for other eyes, not for him, as any others artists, its why he continue to design typefaces after all), as any master in this art. <br> <br>I clearly see the philosophy of RS on Chronos: How to emulate handriting roots in a Sans, as we can do in a Serif typeface. His answer is Chronos. Handwriting his the key of all (special cases are Adobe Garamond 1989 and Myriad 1992 for good reasons) of his typefaces. Little like Zapf in some aspects, but in different results. I see more influence from Zapf and Schneider and others master calligrapher in Slimbach typefaces than anything else. If the people who kept going stupid accusation such TodayChronos don't understand than basic fact, they really not in position to understand anything in typeface design philosophy, and all the hours, us typeface designers when spend in front of our designs. <br> <br>As usual, some people seems to close their eyes, stop to built their own analyse and lost their "bon sens" in front a of problem. They prefer to listen any stupid BIG words without any senses from people who just have a jealousy problem, as its with Trajan drama or some others typefaces with good reputation. <br> <br>Built your own thinking rather than built it from others fake comments without any feelings and open eyes on the typeforms themselves. <br> <br>Or, quickly you finally to put in same basket Slimbach and others with Mr King and others. This is dangerous and, its too me, what behind this eternal stupid accusation. <br> <br>Joyeuses P</div>

<div class=commentbody>To my amateur typofile eyes, the italic of Cronos in the posted sample has a quite different structure than Today Sans. The roman is similar, but for example the bent tops of the 'r' and 'n' stems is also in Meta, which I think is earlier than TodaySans. <br> <br>The larger question here is this. R.G. Collingwood, in his book 'What is Art?' points out that the periods when the greatest work has been done, such as Shakespear in literature or the Renaissance in visual arts, the people took from each other pretty freely. The community is helping even the best people to be better. At the same time, people do need to get credit and earn money for what they have produced. How do you serve both these goals? </div>

An individual's views seem to depend much less on "The Truth" and Logic than personal circmstancial background/upbringing. For example, one of the people defending Cronos hates Bill Troop (for an unrelated issue - although that has to do with plagiarism too). It's the old "The enemy of my enemy is my friend", which I consider a very short-sighted way to make decisions. In this case for example it has produced a highly awkward alliance with somebody who makes Bill look like a wilting lily. <br> <br>> Is this just an excentric view of a couple of guys? <br> <br>1. I'm nowhere near as rabid as Bill about this. Considering things like Extreme Sans, Cronos is a small fish indeed. <br>2. Some other designers (at least one of them pretty famous) do actually agree that at the very least credit was due and was not given. <br> <br>> the legal side <br> <br>Which is such a farce that to me it's not even worth talking about. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The design of Cronos has not been <i>copyrighted</i>. It has been given a design patent, which is a limited protection (14 years?) granted to novel designs, based on a detailed submission that must include reference to 'prior art' that may have influenced the design. I have not seen Adobe's patent submission for Cronos, but my understanding is that they acknowledged Today Sans as prior art. Is this giving adequate credit? I don't know. <br> <br>Hrant mentions that one of the defenders of Cronos hates Bill Troop because of an unrelated issue). It is worth bearing in mind that Bill Troop hates Adobe because of an unrelated issue. <br> <br>I've looked at Cronos and Today Sans pretty closely. The similarities are mainly in the proportion of the letters and in the overall appearance of text set in both. A page of text in Cronos looks a <i>lot</i> like a page of text in Today Sans. Comparison of the individual letterforms reveals, of course, all sorts of difference in detail and, as Jean-Fran</div>

<div class=commentbody>BTW, John, I still think it's important to see the text of the Cronos patent.

<div class=commentbody>Ok, let set up a rule (perhaps a game in fact): For each new typeface, list ALL influences (including thoses you suppose others will imagine too as influence) you can have on the specimen showing. And ask to put it at the end of the publisher catalog too. At the end theses lists will take more space than the fonts showing themselves. <br> <br>And some people will start a new topic on typophile.com and discussing why all typefaces showing are nowadays so small in catalogs and start to complain about them, for whatever reasons. <br> <br>More later, couple of years after, some old guys (the same who have very very long list of influence) will tell young guys why all theses small showing started to became more and more smaller. all of this came from a 2003 topic about how two different typefaces can be related each others. <br> <br>In same time, during some annual type conference, the type designers with the most long list of influencers will be honored by a prize (given only every three years), perhaps called "Cronos prize" in memory of the good old days of catalogs with big typeface showing perhaps? <br> <br>In reality this is not funny at all. <br>So, my new problem is why Comic Sans is so influence by Souvenir?

<div class=commentbody>>Let's get a link to that, so it can be really public. <br> <br>OK, here it is: <br> <br><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=D400%2C913.WKU.&OS=PN/D400%2C913&RS=PN/D400%2C913" target=_blank>http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=D400,913.WKU.&OS=PN/D400,913&RS=PN/D400,913</a> <br> <br>I had trouble opening the link to the full images on the site, but the following was on the page: <br> <br>The primary patent examiner was Cathy Anne MacCormac. Included with the patent application were samples of: <br> <br>Cable Light & Heavy, Futura Medium & Bold, ITC Legacy Sans, Gill Sans, Charlotte Sans, Lucida Sans, Agenda, Syntax, ITC Stone Sans, Today Sans Serif <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I wasn't suggesting that John or JFP are unequivocally right. <br>I'm just glad opinions are being intelligently expressed <br>here -- without the allegations.</div>

<div class=commentbody>So opinions are OK as long as nobody is offended? <br>Like is "I think Madonna's new hair color is rad" acceptable? <br>And what if I'm offended by uselessly bland opinions? <br> <br>Heraclitus, baby, Heraclitus. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>William, thanks for that link. <br> <br>So I don't get it, what does it say about Today-Sans, exactly? And how is the reference to Today-Sans different than the one to Gill? Certainly no mentally stable type designer would pretend Cronos is too close to Gill for comfort. It seems like a sick joke to even mention Today-Sans in there... Or maybe they needed to mention the closest design to it out there, so that in the future nobody could bring that up to invalidate the patent? I guess that's what happens when a patent officer has an average of 90 minutes to approve a patent (and his outfit makes more money by approving a patent than not). Not that they have the necessary typographic insight anyway... BTW, what does "ornamental design" mean?! Lastly, what exactly happens 14 years after 1997/8? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I couldn't open the 'image' at the bottom of the linked page. I assume this has much of the patent application, though I don't know. If someone else can get it open, we can learn. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Those images only show samples of Cronos. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>BTW, Joe, what about the -admittedly obtuse- allegations against <i>me</i> in this thread? <br>So are allegations OK as long as they're weasely? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
