    Warhol, <em>Songs for Drella</em> there's a line (I'm assuming it's a Warhol quote)
    in the song <em>Images</em>: \"If you think technique is meaning, you might find
    me very simple\". \r\nAnd juxtapositioning may well be a classic surrealist clich\xE9,
    but this kind of decontextualization is also something we see in post modern art
    and design. Peter Savilles work for New Order (case in point, the  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(album)|Republic]]

    IS meaning, and artists such as the Velvets went out of the way to disappear theirs,
    Sister Ray says, which is a technique in its own right. Isn't that what Ruscha
    was trying to do by designing his own \"type\"? That's why it is deliberately
    amateurish/vernacular (that, and the fact that he is no Wim Crouwel).\r\n\r\nAndy
    Warhol was technically brilliant in many media, and he was an accomplished commercial
    illustrator before he dropped the a. One would have to say that any apparent lack
    of technique in his work is quite intentional, and that it does require skill
    to make something brilliant while looking like you're not really trying.\r\n\r\nDamien
    Hirst's \"nutraceutical\" packaging is a terrible parody of commercial design.
    Bad art direction: he should have hired a branding agency to do the work, not
    Barnbrook, whose sensibility is far from corporate. But then, if it had looked
    like the real thing (see below), what would have been the point? So it's just
    a bad idea.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0_285_427_http---offlinehbpl_5414.hbpl.co.uk-news-OMC-EDCE9194-EA98-9236-485949777B8ADE0B.jpg]\r\n\r\n"
