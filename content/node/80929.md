body: "\r\nTrying the find the name of the serif typeface used in the link below (i.e.
  so not Futura which is also used). I have seen it a few times and even took a note
  of the name once - but have lost this, so has been really frustrating me. What makes
  it tricky is that it is obviously a pretty bold variant of the typeface (assuming
  two weights up from the regular/roman weight). But I am sure it is a relatively
  common typeface. Anyway, any help is much appreciated. I am normally very good at
  identifying so will try and help other posts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.becausestudio.co.uk/projects/findingzion/"

  body: Oh thanks. That is pretty weird eh? Looks like you just can't buy it. Luckily
    I have it on a font disk (just a large collection of many fonts, perfectly legit
    of course)
