  a science film about atoms and molecules.\r\n\r\ni'm seeking recommendations for
  fonts, font families, or font designers/vendors with a distinctive science/sci-fi/futuristic
  feeling.\r\nwhen i use these keywords in myfonts.com i get surprisingly same-old,
  blocky, 80's looking examples.\r\n\r\nany recommendations ? i'll be choosing a few
  to experiment with. \r\n\r\nfully legit protocols will be followed, including obliging
  the distributor/client to license their own copies (after design approval) for extended
  packaging use."

  body: "It's really hard to recommend futuristic fonts, since there have been so
    many different perceptions of what type will look like in the future, almost all
    of which, in a different context, look very retro. My favorite version of the
    future is a movement back towards Art Deco, so something like [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000122|Mostra]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-anna/|Anna]] could be what you're
    looking for. Anna is pretty prevalently used in Tomorrowland in the Disney parks.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/|Bank
    Gothic]] is pretty popular for conveying a futuristic feeling, but it may be too
    closely associated with Chipotle and sci-fi movies.\r\n\r\nYou could go for something
    like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?params[boolean]=and&params[searchtype]=fonts&search[text]=computer|Computer]],
    which has kind of a 1960s perception of the future.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/search?params[boolean]=and&params[searchtype]=fonts&search[text]=handel%20gothic|Handel
    Gothic]] is what the future looked like in the early 80s.\r\n\r\nOr you could
    do the ironic \"World of Tomorrow!\" look, which you can achieve with almost anything
    from [[http://www.fontdiner.com|FontDiner]].\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "thanks everyone for the suggestions ! these chiseled solids are consistent
    with what i was thinking... that's encouraging. i'll be experimenting with several
    of these. \r\n\r\npaul: feisar is supercool ! \r\n\r\none thing that has become
    a rather daunting issue (switching over to a license thread) is the standard EULA
    i'm finding regarding film usage. yes, i read them completely. there's rather
    unclear clauses in the the font bros, house, and font diner EULA's about annual
    broadcast schedule and mandatory renewal of the license annually... not sure i
    understand the clause but i have written to the foundries seeking clarification.
    i love the house 3009 package but the EULA may be prohibitive. this drives me
    nuts. i don't want to show a design to the client if it comes attached to a maintenance/renewal
    issue. i'm not sure there's an entity in place to deal with that once the film
    is distributed. it's a science film, not a hollywood blockbuster.\r\n\r\ni'm also
    going to take a shot at designing my own title - not a font per se, but a custom
    type treatment. \r\n\r\nany further suggestions are welcome!"

  body: Oh, Bank Gothic is  wonderful typeface. You just have to use it with a bit
    of love, and maybe not set it as is, out-of-the-box, so to speak. There are a
    lot of Bank Gothic alternatives if you still can't get over its boxy-ness or its
    all-caps-ness.

    Nob by Ian Anderson (presented in FUSE 6) could be a tool to construct \"molecular\"

    become difficult to buy. I have found something [[http://www.fontshop.de/sukr.php3?ch=%2Ffontproductdetailc.php3%3Fns%3D1%26sns%3D0%26ns%3D1%26sns%3D0%26co%3D%26co2%3D%26id%3D6034160|here]].\r\n\r\nAnd
