Good eye David. The ad is from 1965, and she was a model then.

I like the way the stripes in the typeface go with the stripes in the fabric print and the planks and the girders in the tower.
It was a stripey time.

		<div class="commentbody">Coney Island’s pretty much closed for the season now, yes? And on top of that Astroland and a good chunk is going permanently, right? The way I hear, out east a ways, is that only the Ferris Wheel and he Cyclone will survive. As Landmarks. Oh, yeah, and the parachute skeleton. The boardwalk has to also, yes? Or is whatever developing there will to be going to make the boardwalk off-limits somehow? Damn! There goes the old haunts. Once and for all.

A buddy of mine, my now-82-year old dad, and I make a pilgrimage there and to the old neighborhood once a year. Usually right after Labor Day. it’s delayed this year, maybe a week or two more, because my buddy's ill--but we're going to have to do it soon, because I figure the face of it starts to change again any second.

I'm reminded, however—because of where this has come up, on this forum—that for years and year and to this day, there’s something about getting to where I can finally see certain distinctive types—the ones that spell out “Wonder Wheel,” “Nathan’s,” “Cyclone,” “Shoot the Geek” (not one that was there when I was a kid, but that always sadly cracks me up now).

Thanks for reminding me. Got to make some phone calls today and get this year’s little expedition scheduled.</div>

Yves, you're right. Cringe-inducing Helvetica's curves may be, but nobody can deny the success of its design. I can't be the only person with good taste who thinks Helvetica in bold weight looks decent.

Whatever happened to the mega bold weight?

Unfortunately I chose something along the lines of good fonts as my subject, and was later told that I can’t dwell on esoterica or other such boring stuff. So I’m going to pad it out with clips from Helvetica.

And taking photos at Coney Island after Labor Day is a great idea. I wish our mayor had built one of those, instead of a new ballpark for a sucky team that chargers too much for tickets.

Yep, hockey season can’t start soon enough. It’s funny, I’ve become a Caps fan, and now I know how Cubs fans feel.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Coney Island in the off-season is fantastic. Don't forget to grab a drink at Ruby's. It's great on a foggy fall day. But I think it's a very sad sign of the direction NYC is headed that Astroland is closing for good to be replaced by condos, a hotel, and a Disnified, Vegasized version of the old Coney. Problem with Coney is that tourists don't go there much. Which is of course why we locals love it. Where else can you ride the teacups with your kids right next to a junkie and her kids? It's the real deal, honky tonk and all. They even had a real freak show (not a side show) until recently, which cured me of any interest in freak shows.

But all that means it has no value for Mayor Dollarsign. 

First sign of trouble was when they tore down the Thunderbolt coaster (featured in Annie Hall) followed by shutting down the flea market - which was really a junk sale. And now Astroland. The city no longer has a soul.

James, I am so sorry about your dog.

I think this has already been done. I've found what looks like Helv megabold on at least one LIFE magazine cover from the 1960's.

I drew face below from scratch in about four hours. E and F are too narrow, and the weight distribution is patchy, but you get the idea.

That effect was HARD to get in the old days. I wonder if it was planned, or an accident. I remember getting something like that when I processed negatives in water that was too hot. I can't imagine the effort it would take to get the effect deliberately.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Ricardo. I decided to make this font before reading your suggestion. It's more an exercise than a serious font, but I had fun making it. That's why I didn't post it in the Critique forums (for those wondering).

Thanks I'm glad you like it :^)  Thankyou for saying so.

Glad you like the quote Dennis.

For Nick Shinn, Patty Fab, Zara Evans, Yves, sii, James Puckett and everyone other typophiler who's around at the moment---have I said or done something to offend you all? 

Tell me about it.

If I'm being subjected to the Silence Brigade because you think I haven't got a clue, that's one mother of an assumption, and seriously in error. I've known since Nick started this thread it isn't really about Helvetica, the title being used as a euphemism for boredom. If my essaying Helvetica has bored you that's wasteful. I only posted the comps because Ricardo suggested I do some drawings.

The question is---can you dig it?

I don't think that's asking a lot.

Oh don't tell me, I hijacked the thread. You think so? What happened to typographic collaboration, the slogan Typophile doesn't live up to?

I wonder. I wonder sometimes what motivates you people. You appear to be fixated with certain things---and only certain things---at the expense of everything else.

I am happy and have plenty of other places to be :^)

When I say something and get no responses. Not every post I make, just certain posts. Nevermind.

<em>James, if you want comments on your font, post in the Critique section.</em>

It's not seriously a font. It was just a bit of fun with Helvetica, as I explained a few posts above to Ricardo. I thought you were bored and tried to alleviate that with something interesting.

Nevermind.

And I like the many directions other posters have pulled this thread. I certainly don't perceive any ill will toward you (here or anywhere else on this forum). That you're not getting comments about your experiment I think is merely a function of the wackiness of this thread. As you say, if you'd posted it in the Critique section you would have gotten constructive criticism; here the conversation may flow anywhere.

Patty, all I wanted was some feedback. Your book jacket designs are great by the way; looking at them makes my toes tingle with delight :^)

Nick, if the response to people who post material on the "wrong" forum(s) is derision and slagging, that's just rude. People will always do it, either consciously or by mistake, and the only fair way of responding is with a bit of courtesy. Sending good vibes your way.

Thanyou for your attention, Typophilers.

James, I'm not much of a font-critiquer. I also don't often use Ultra Bold fonts. I think your 'g' needs some work, it pulls strangely to the  lower right, and the 'a' is also a little awkward, but otherwise I think - especially given how quickly you did it - that you've done a nice job. Nick is right tho, if you wanted constructive crit on the font, the Critique forum is the way to go. It wasn't clear you were expecting comments on your font, it just seemed like a bit of fun.

I like this thread too - I tend to come here when I'm bored too. Be thankful sometimes when you don't get responses, there are some sharp tongues on this forum (including, sometimes, mine).</div>

Tingling toes---you are a very, very talented artist. Seriously good taste.

<em>Be thankful sometimes when you don’t get responses, there are some sharp tongues on this forum (including, sometimes, mine).</em>

Understood :^) My tounge gets pointy too on occasion. Typophiles are passionate people.

Completely changing the subject: in the advertising biz I have to do a lot of research. The other day I did a Google image search for "sassy", and this pic came up. Love that k-S ligature.

I didn't really got it that you wanted crits on your Helvetica-experiment. I doubt it that people are purposely ignored here. Eventhough my thread on the crit board is also way too silent. I would like to have more crits as well. But people probably just think they don't have anything useful to add. Or I just tell that myself, lol. ;)</div>
