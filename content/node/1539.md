  body: I&#39;m not saying that these logos you are posting do not use digital type,
    but I will say that Ms. Fili has old type books and it would not surprise me if
    you had difficulty finding these type digitally. Why the interest? Just curious.
    You should also ask about the script type on the cover of her last book, &#34;Counter
    Culture&#34;.

    feel, but it&#39;s not a perfect match.

  body: Does it not look like the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/15494.html"
    target="_blank">Georgian Initials that Mike ID-ed</a>? I know the C is not a perfect
    match, but it looks pretty close. And like Tiff said, not digital as well.

  body: The Emerald Gity Fontwerks font Decadence Condensed is also similar.  I don&#39;t
    know anything about its inspirations -- perhaps it is based on one of the fonts
    mentioned above. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~ecf/alphabet.htm"
