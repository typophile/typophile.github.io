  the fonts I've used I'm not completely sure that they gel together perfectly. Although
  it's too late to change the design of the poster (it's been printed) I'd be interested
  in any comments. I began the design with the intent of using Machia (from Flat-it)
  for the section titles and chose the other faces around it.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe poster
  is 22\" x 37\" (trimmed) and was offset printed CMYK on glossy paper (with a glossy
  coating / varnish over the ink). The images are approximately 20 dpi, 90 dpi, and
  200 dpi. The poster is intended to be displayed in schools and the homes of geometers.
  Earlier versions of the poster can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.peda.com/posters/archive.html\">http://www.peda.com/posters/archive.html</a>."
