body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhen multiple keystrokes are entered to represent an OpenType composite
  glyph that is referenced with a 'sub' feature, such as typing option-e e on OS X
  to get an eacute, are the individual unicode indexes from the keystrokes recorded
  in the document or the unicode index for the composite? \r\n\r\nFor instance, an
  option-e e is U+02CA and U+0065. If an OpenType feature does a sub of these keystrokes
  to U+00E9 is the U+00E9 saved in the document or the 'e' plus the acutecomb? What
  about a ccmp feature that doesn't point to a specific Unicode index?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What you are talking about are so-called dead-key combinations. The first
    keystroke changes the state of the keyboard to \"attention, now follows a special
    keystroke\", and then the latter genenrates a codepoint. It's usually only one
    codepoint, the precomposed character. \r\n\r\nOf course you can write your own
    keyboard driver that produces any keystrokes you need. On Windows, there is the
    free Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC). \r\n\r\nOpenType features such
    as ccmp work on glyphs. From the perspective of an OpenType Layout feature, it
    does not matter if a glyph has an Unicode codepoint associated with it or not.
    \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"

    body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\nWhere I'm going with this topic is related to spell checking,
      the order that the gyphs are appllied and how to transliterate a document created
      with a prior font to a unicode font. Many years ago I used ResEdit for keyboard
      layouts. Now I use Ukelele or the MS keyboard creator. As an example, one character
      that may present difficulties is with what our group calls a 'glotallized, wedge
      C'. The character is composed of a 'C' with a caroncomb above the C and a commaabove
      above the caroncomb. I guess my choices are to use a 'C' with separate glyphs
      for the caroncomb and the commaabove. Or, I could use the glyph at U+010C with
      a commaabove. Or, I noticed in the Character Palette tool on OSX a single glyph
      in the PUA F728. Since I want to use spell checking, the last option is probably
      not usable. What I'm trying to determine is how the glyphs appear at the text
      level for spell checking. So, does a dead key with OpenType record an option-e
      e as two indexes or just one in the text file. I'm pretty new to all of this
      and trying to dig into specifics.\r\nThanks,\r\n"

  body: My opinion is that dead key technology is becoming obsolete. It is really
    only useful for arriving at precomposed diacritic characters, so while it will
    get you to your C with a caron (U+010C), it will not get you any further. My recommendation
    for dealing with Unicode text entry is to avoid the dead key method and instead
    design keyboards to enter sequences of base plus combining marks as discreet characters.
    These can then be resolved using either character level mapping in a text engine
    or glyph level substition (ccmp) or postioning (mark and mkmk). This is the approach
    I've taken in the new polytonic Greek layout I am working on, since I need to
    be able to support non-standard combinations that might occur in early manuscripts.
