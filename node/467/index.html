<div class=commentbody>Hmm. Sorry to contradict, guys, but that sans doesn't <br>look like Metro to me. Granted, it's a small sample. But <br>the tail of the Metro g continues further around the <br>curve, and so does the top of the a; the Metro s has <br>a more closed aperture top and bottom; the Metro w is <br>slightly narrower and quite idiosyncratic, with unequal <br>interior and exterior angles; and the overall x-height <br>of Metro is proportionately a little larger. <br> <br>This looks more like an import to me. I'm thinking <br>probably Erbar. Unfortunately, there are no good online <br>samples, as there has not yet been a digitization of the <br>original Erbar, not that I'm aware of. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Funny, I thought we were trying to ID the masthead font but then I noticed all these posts about Metro and figured out everybody was shooting for the teeny little font below it. <br> <br>Regarding the masthead, it could be Coronet but the cap 'T' is so home rolled, I wonder if it's a one off job that somebody did a while back to slightly alter Coronet - That 'D' is unmistakable. <br> <br>Now regarding the font below, I got another chuckle since it so closely matches my Lionel Family which was inspired by lettering I found in an old Lionel Train repair manual. I'm attaching a sample for your consideration. It's my first serious text face and I'm quite fond of it. <br> <br>Upon a critique by Matthew Carter, he insisted there was no reason for this font to exist because Futura already existed :D <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12264.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>(Insert sound of exasperation here) <br> <br>Sure, while the Lionel lower-case bears a lot of similarity to Futura, the upper-case and numerals have a very distinctive (and pleasant) personality. <br> <br>And perusing Matthew Carter's faces, especially the slight differences between <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-century-schoolbook/>New Century Schoolbook</a> and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/>Miller</a>, I think what we have here is a slight case of the pot calling the kettle derivative.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>MSS by WAD</i> was the Typophile Chapbook XVII, 1947. <br>(The original Typophiles, that is.) But that was pretty <br>much just essays by Dwiggins. Your Metro sample is <br>from page 224 of the second volume from the set of <br>Typophile Chapbooks XXXV and XXXVI, <i>Postscripts on <br>Dwiggins</i>. This was begun shortly after WAD's death <br>as a commemorative and was published a couple <br>years later in 1960. <br> <br>-- K. <br> <br>BTW, I'll probably be showing images of some of WAD's <br>original ink sketches for Metro as part of my TypeCon <br>presentation. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh, and my guess on that nameplate is that it was <br>done up as a logotype (original meaning of the word), <br>one piece of metal (maybe a zinc?), based on Coronet, <br>but taking advantage of the single piece to make the <br>script fully connecting. (Look at the ending curves of <br>the two n's -- each slightly different.) I suspect that it <br>would have been impossible to space this tight as a <br>font of individual sorts. Even on an angled body. <br> <br>Middleton designed Coronet for Ludlow in 1937, so <br>it would have been <i>au courant.</i> <br> <br>-- K. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>This is slightly off topic, but as Kent mentioned the original Typophiles... <br> <br>I've got a friend who works down at the New York Public <br>Library as an archivist.

<div class=commentbody>Tim: <br> <br>The sub-line, I have as Intertype Vogue Bold. A very popular sans right through to the end of letterpress in the late sixties in our area (newspaper). Mac McGrew dates the light and bold weights as being made by Intertype in 1930. Medium and Extrabold coming in later years. Mac's book, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, is an Oak Knoll publication, still available, case bound and perfect bound. It's a fine thing to have if for no other reason than to be able to satisfy one's self about identifying the naggingly familiar types that show up and drive us crazy. <br> <br>My guess is that the masthead proper is a piece of good hand-lettering. <br> <br>Jim</div>

<div class=commentbody>Karen -- <br> <br>This here Typophile is certainly original -- i.e., nothing <br>else like it. But for those who are familiar with the older, <br>New York Typophiles club (they figure prominently in <br>the history of mid-20th-century American typography <br>and printing, with many notable members), it's a little <br>odd to reconcile the similar use of the name. That's all. <br> <br>Thanks for the link, John. I knew they were still active. <br>Didn't know they had finally put up a site. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The script seems to be handlettered. Look at the repeated letters: n, a, e, i. (Plus, from my persuals through my college newspaper's archives, I've noticed the masthead was handlettered/illustrated up until they went with Avant Garde in the '70s.) <br> <br>It's sad they don't use something like that now instead of trying the WSJ look. My college newspaper uses Utopia caps for its banner. Boring.</div>
