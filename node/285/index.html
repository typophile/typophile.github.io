  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">For my thesis i intend to create a typeface library on the web in which users can search for fonts (free, commercial, not really sure yet) by entering a keyword or creative concept (as well and name, style, designer etc). <BR>I guess it would function like the stock photography sites (imagebank, photonica). <BR> <BR>I believe this is a more effective and more relevant way to search for fonts and would remove the need to scroll through screed of alphabetised pages.  This process would also be accompanied with a new waay to browse through the search results - this is omething i am currently working on. <BR> <BR>I'm just gonna put my idea out there. <BR>What do guys think?   <BR>Do you reckon a tool like this is needed for the type community? <BR>Any feedback would be great!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think there's a basic problem. As soon as you start categorising fonts by &quot;creative concept&quot;, you are in effect stereotyping the use of the font. Anyone who used such a system as a way of selecting fonts would be stuck with cliches, because the system would be (in effect) a giant cliche reproduction machine &hellip; which is not what anyone needs. <BR> <BR>You can go only so far with reasonably &quot;objective&quot; categories (serif, sans serif, text, display etc). They end up being too large to be really useful. As soon as you start trying to sub-divide them into specific &quot;styles&quot; or &quot;uses&quot;, you enter the realm of subjective judgement. Nothing wrong with that. But a system that tries to allow you to make choices like that by relying on the crutch of how others use or see type is not really going to produce &quot;creativity&quot;, but bland uniformity. <BR> <BR>It's tempting to think this would work because it works in some other areas (like choosing books or restaurants or whatever). There is some value in those fields to being guided by what other people think. But they are about consumption not production. Once &quot;creativity&quot; becomes the replication of what is generally accepted it is going to be stale.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some people like cliches. What one has to look at is the use for the engine. If I need to identify a typeface, then cliches are <i>good</i> in that they can help me identify a particular font. <BR> <BR>But what about for a new font selection. The world of type is immensely large, just like music - it is unlikely that someone will listen to every album on earth in the hope of finding new music to listen to. <BR> <BR>To beat that similie into a bit more shape, look at Amazon. If I have a look for a Crass CD on amazon, I'll also get peer recommendations for other bands - some of these will be close in style, some will be close in politics, some will be close merely in that the people who like that band may be more <i>inclined</i> to like other completely unrelated bands, but of a similar <i>statue</i>. <BR> <BR>Back to a font example - if I did a search for a 30s typeface, in with all that chaff of art deco nonsense, I might come across Gill Sans. Further exploration could tell em that other people who liked this also liked Perpetua (which is a 30s font, but does not necessarily look like the cliche of one, at least, not to Joe Bloggs). Suddenly, because of the use of human beings in all this, I have a few items presented to me that may be fitting, but do not extend the cliche. <BR> <BR>Just a thought.</div>
