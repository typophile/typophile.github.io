  people like me, who are in design or development, often face a big problem in choosing
  right font. As the internet has many free download sources, so we have thousands
  of fonts in our PCs. Once I used to face problem to find the right font from my
  huge collection. And it took a very long time as well as it was a hassle because
  I didn\u2019t have any Font Explorer. Finally I found a cool tool called \u201CFontExpert
  2007\u201D and it\u2019s really great and handy. That\u2019s why I want to share
  this cool tool with my friends.\r\n\r\nYou can easily download it from here: http://rapidshare.com/files/152867112/FontExpert_2007.rar\r\n\r\nAnd
  if you have a better one then feel free to share with us :-)\r\n"
