    culture. Greek fonts: I think non-Greeks did a lot of damage in the past &#40;like
    Porson, and even Aldus&#41;, but in the computer age the Greeks themselves made
    things worse. But it looks like in the past decade there&#39;s been a lot of discontent

    the &#34;latinized&#34; of greek letters by various non-greeks made damage &#40;to
    me the most horrible example was Van Krimpen&#39;s &#34;Romulus&#34;, but I like
    Porson&#39;s types&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I guess, you propably know Yorgos Matthiopoulos
    and the Greek Fonts Society. People like Yorgos and Klimis Mastorides are our
    hopes for this  renaissance you mention...but to be honnest, maybe 1 in 10 graphic
    designers in Greece really care about the identity of the form of the greek letters,
    not to say that adjusting the forms of latin fonts seems ideal to them...and that&#39;s
    why I think Matthiew Carter is one of the great designers of our times, but he
    did make damage in the development of the greek design identity. '

    <BR>I was only at the conference the day I was on. Your town simply had too much
    to offer! <BR> <BR>Romulus was indeed a monster, but even in this age of &#40;supposed&#41;
    cultural sensitivity it has admirers. And it&#39;s interesting to note that some
    of our best Latin designers made some of the worst non-Latin fonts. Why is this?
    I think the reason is pride, a dangerous two-edged sword: it motivates creativity
    in what&#39;s your own, but also causes you to look down on what isn&#39;t. <BR>
    <BR>The problem I see with Porson is one of my main contentions with the whole
    of western philosophy, and its love of simplification; humans are not simple things
    - ligatures are &#42;useful&#42;. Plus the one thing he should have &#34;simplified&#34;
    &#40;removing the slant that Aldus so wrongly implemented&#41;, he didn&#39;t.
    <BR> <BR>There seems to be a lot of Greek type designers these days, but my acquaintance
    with them is as limited as my understanding of the script. That said, the person
    who has so far impressed me the most on the ground is Katsoulidis; there&#39;s
    also Gerry Leonidas, who has great depth of knowledge. <BR> <BR>As for most Greeks
    not caring, yes, it&#39;s a problem, since change comes quickest when people have
    awareness. But as long as there&#39;s less people who favor Latinized type than
    those who want to return to authenticity, that&#39;s not so bad. In the 70s, when
    Carter was making those Latinized fonts, he was following the direct wishes of
    his Greek clients. He really couldn&#39;t have said &#34;shame on you for betraying
    your culture&#34;... Who wants to become a martyr for somebody else&#39;s culture?
    &#40;Well, I guess the idle bourgeoisie does, with their &#34;Free Tibet&#34;
    bumper stickers...&#41; I think it&#39;s a very high reflection on Carter that
    he had enough of a reaction to the cultural bankruptcy of his Greek clients to
    make Cadmus &#40;and then Skia&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' greece&#39;s problem is its complex to highlight its relation to ancient
    greece and to insist that it has been the cradle for western culture to which
    we want to belong now, &#34;forgetting&#34; that for a long period greece belonged
    to the east... <BR> <BR>that&#39;s why we regard anything imported from the west
    as something divine and consider some eastern traditional achievemets as not so
    cool... <BR> <BR>there is a need for us to understand the evolution of greek fonts...  <BR>
    <BR>if you think of the fact that the design of greek fonts until the end of the
    20th century was an import, you&#39;ll understand that there is no greek history
    at all... <BR> <BR>so we come to the dilemma for &#34;new&#34; greek font designers:
    to start again with the bycantine legacy &#40;historically correct, but difficult
    to introduce&#41; or to follow the achievements of the foreign teachers &#40;also
    difficult, if you work with a criteria&#41;?.. <BR> <BR>there is also a third
    solution, which is being followed by new greek font &#34;designers&#34; and which
    is the most common habit here:.. to take a latin font and use the latin lc &#34;n&#34;
    as an lc &#34;eta&#34;, the latin lc &#34;s&#34; for the final lc &#34;sigma&#34;,
    the latin lc &#34;z&#34; for the lc &#34;zeta&#34;, et al...  <BR> <BR>this is
    happening, because there is no historical self-conscience and, as a bigger reason,
    it is faster to implement and faster to be sold &#40;if sold, because the greeks
    seem to admire burt lancaster in &#34;the red corsar&#34;&#41;... <BR> <BR>and
    when you see that the need for new fonts in the greek market is concentrated mainly
    in the lifestyle magazine and advertising sector, then you&#39;ll understand the
    &#34;need for speed&#34; of a font design... globalization happens also here...
    <BR> <BR>and as long as greek designers will be profit-oriented followers &#40;but
    kings in their village&#41;, there will be not much correct font development here
    in greece...  <BR> <BR>not to forget that in the only public eductional faculty
    in greece &#40;tei of athens&#41;, where you can &#34;study&#34; for three semesters
    font design, you are taught by architects and painters... bright font designers,
    like katsoulidis and matthiopulos, teach graphic design and computer graphics
    in the same faculty... <BR> <BR>&#40;so i guess from pumpkins to porson, we have
    got now to greece&#39;s problems in the sector of education&#41; <BR> <BR>as far
    as for your excuse that dolmades are not suitable for the greek version of your
    bitmap font, i don&#39;t understand why you tried it on dolmades and not on pumpkins,
    which can also be found in greece... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: According to John Bowman, &#34;The most important Greek type ever was that
    designed for the Cambridge University Press by Richard Porson.&#34; &#40;Greek
    Letters, p. 131&#41; Although I wouldn&#39;t necessarily dispute that, I would
    certainly add that Porson&#39;s work was also in some ways a very important step
    <i>backwards</i> as well. In a textbook Modernist manner&#42;, he banished ligatures
    from Greek, in the naive desire to make it easier to read. As if humans are computers.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; If way before Modernism was an &#34;official&#34; movement. To
    me Modernism is actually the natural thought pattern of Western Civilization.

  body: 'In Britain, Porson may be seen as the turning point in the sense that before
    his new type almost all Greek set in Britain used the Aldine style, with or without
    diacritics. On the continent, the Didot romantic style had already spread rapidly,
    and this too was generally set without ligatures. But I think the absence of ligatures
    in both these styles needs to be seen as a response to the decline in the use
    of ligatures that had preceded their development. <BR> <BR>It should be noted
    that the Porsonic style remained an almost purely British phenomenon: it was never
    takem up on the continent, nor in Greece.'

  body: 'Scholderer&#39;s New Hellenic is definitely not Porsonic. New Hellenic refers
    back to the Complutensian Greek and other pre-Aldine styles, a development that
    began with Robert Proctor&#39;s Otter type. Proctor&#39;s <i>The printing of Greek
    in the fifteenth century</i> had a big influence on Scholderer. <BR> <BR>The Porsonic
    style is very distinct from the later developments of Proctor and Scholderer.
    Like the Aldine style, the Porsonic has upright caps and slanted lowercase. The
    most distinctive characteristic of the style are the lunate epsilon and the very
    round, full alpha. The Porsonic style is a kind of hybrid of the Aldine and Romantic
    styles but simplified and regularised. It looks like what it is: Richard Porson&#39;s
    meticulously neat Greek handwriting, which North Americans would call &#39;printing&#39;
    because with few exceptions the letters do not join up.'
