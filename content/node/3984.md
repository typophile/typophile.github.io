  contains roman numerals? &#40;I think roman numerals is the right name, by this
  I mean: I, II, III, IV, etc.&#41;. I&#39;ve checked experts sets and couldn&#39;t
  find anything. Any input? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Em <BR> <BR>PS: Already posted this

  body: Roman numbers are simply combinations of certain Latin letters used as numerals.
    That is, there is no Roman numeral II, there is only a Roman number II written
    with the numeral I. Similarly, there is only a number IV, written with the numerals
    I and V. The same two numerals are used to write the number VI, in the same way
    as the Arabo-European numerals 1 and 6 can be used to write the numbers 16 and
    61. It is a good idea, when talking about numerals and numbers, to be clear about
    the distinction. <BR> <BR>I think what you are looking for is a font that permits
    a stylised representation of a subset of Roman <i>numbers</i>, perhaps with a
    line above and below?

    but understandably few fonts fill them. <BR>

  body: 'Yes, I think Emilie is talking about the style with the rules, probably the
    one most often seen in pre-typographic writing, before expediency caused the adoption
    of a simple string of &#34;X&#34;, &#34;V&#34;, etc. The difference between normal
    caps and barred Roman numerals isn&#39;t just the bars though: I think the Roman
    numerals have to be smaller too - like smallcaps. <BR> <BR>There must be some
    fonts like that, but I know of only one: ND Fontana &#40;by Ruben Fontana&#41;.
    <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/fontana-nd/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/fontana-nd/</a>
    <BR>But I&#39;m not actually sure if the retail version has the Roman nums. All
    I know is that tipoGrafica magazine uses them, and they look sharp indeed: <BR>
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/32168.gif" alt="Fontana">
    <BR> <BR>Interestingly: <BR>1&#41; They&#39;re in a sans font. <BR>2&#41; The
    bars are not full. But look at the bottom of that &#34;V&#34;! Wonderful. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, I think one reason for the presence of Roman numerals in Fontana is that
    they&#39;re needed much more in Spanish than English &#40;where things like &#34;15th
    century&#34; are the norm instead&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; there are Unicode code
    points for roman numerals <BR> <BR>Hey, I didn&#39;t know that! <BR>Maybe &#34;true&#34;
    Roman numerals will become the new black... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Cool, thanks for all the input! <BR> <BR>I wasn&#39;t too sure if they were
    usually written together &#40;with the top and bottom bars&#41; or spaced.  <BR>
    <BR>I was using Courier in pretty big size and it looked kind of weird with the
    serifs, especially that the spacing was so wide. I switched to FedraSans and now
    it doesn&#39;t look &#34;off&#34; if they don&#39;t touch each other. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the distinction between numbers and numerals too, I&#39;ll try and remember
    that =&#41; <BR> <BR>
