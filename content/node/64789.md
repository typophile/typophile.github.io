  of a design piece than your typical comic book. Part of my role is to do the lettering
  for the speech bubbles, but as a graphic designer I'm used to picking and using
  'nice' fonts. If I stray too far from the typical stuff found on the likes of [[http://www.blambot.com|Blambot]]
  it won't be accessible to a lot of the readers, but by and large these fonts are
  crap. Any suggestions as a middleground?

    thing I would try to define the reference points. I.E.: are you going the way
    of classic comic books (all caps)? The way of the more mature comic books (like
    Sandman and others, in which some characters use different treatment of typeface
    and/or speech bubbles)? The french (and other european comics) way (upper and
    lower case)?\r\n\r\nThat said, if you really want to make a post-avant-garde-retro-futurist
    statement, you can always typeset all in Comic Sans! ;-)\r\n\r\nP.S.: I suppose
    you already checked http://www.comicbookfonts.com/home.html"

  body: "Wow... Blambot has a craaazy large collection of very usable fonts. Glad
    I caught this post.\r\n\r\nIf you find something better or more appropriate than
    Blambot... definitely post what you find.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, these are script/handwriting
    fonts. And the conventional wisdom is that \"fonts\" will always struggle to match
    the personality of actual handwriting. What you see as mediocrity is largely the
    limits of how close fonts can get to handwriting.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think you underestimate how accessible a non-"comic" typeface can be to
    comic readers. I've seen fine comics with speech set in all kinds of fonts (Kabel
    in all lowercase, for instance) and nobody ever thinks to mention it as long as
    they can read it. Your primary concern should be complementing the style of your
    art, and depending on your art, the question of whether it resembles hand lettering
    is not always high on the list of criteria by which you do that.

    what I used to love about the (French!) comics of \"Valerian\". The alien races
    in, for example, \"Heroes of the Equinox\" have very distinctive speech bubbles
    and lettering."

  body: "Thanks for all your feedback people, some really interesting thoughts. I
    think I was both hasty and misunderstood with my comments on Blambot. I know these
    are good comic fonts, but they're very typical of the genre and I was hoping to
    do something a wee bit different. More importantly though, whenever I've read
    a post like this in the past everyone's just been directly referred to Blambot.
    I wanted to avoid that easy answer and get some discussion/debate and that's what
    I got, so thanks again and sorry if I offended anyone!\r\n\r\nThere are two key
    points you guys raised that have made me think:\r\n1. These are replicating hand-written
    styles and that's key in how appropriate they are for the artwork. It might be
    a huge undertaking and I've worked with comic artists before who wouldn't recommend
    it, but one idea I've had is to choose a font I like with lots of weights and
    versatility, typeset everything as it would be, then trace it to bring a hand-written
    element in. Madness?\r\n2. Many of the styles on Blambot are very American in
    nature. I neglected to mention this, but the project is European and perhaps the
    use of upper and lower case lettering would reflect that better? Something like
    Herge's work with Tintin?\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n"
