  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i have just started to redesign a logo  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for a &quot;chateau&quot;. The company is very famous  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in Greece for their hotel in an amazing landscape <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in Chalkidiki (northern Greece). Wine production  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is a secondary activity of the company  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and the &quot;chateau&quot; is placed in the same  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->landscape to the hotel. There is no need  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to be a connection between the two -i just  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mention the whole thing for the story. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tried to make the design as clearer i can,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->though i kept all the basic shapes in the buildings  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->since i don't know how much i can omit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the moment i prefer A though i am not sure  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about the sizes (that's why A1 and A2). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am looking forward for comments about  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the typography and the clarity of the design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was trying to find a good combination to make  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a ligature but i couldn't see such a case.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If anybody have a suggestion on it i will be  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very pleased to know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks in advance and have you all a nice day. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->christos <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like very much the way that you have used the thinning lines to convey the landscape, but I wonder if the oval shape retained from the original isn't keeping the whole design somewhat rigid. Is that oval shape a requirement from the client? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Otherwise, I don't like the versions with the borders around the image as I find that they make the design heavy. If pressed, however, I would prefer the borders in B, C, D and F because they mirror the lines in the image.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Generally I prefer the versions without the thin-thick line at the bottom as they are more open and welcoming, although the F and H are fun. My favourite example is G. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope that these comments are helpful; I look forward to seeing the final decisions for this project.</div>

No border on the oval and the double rule below the type looks both fresh and modern to my eye but also provides a nice foundation for the type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In general the oval is very active and is eyecatching.

Were it bothers me is in how the oval shape isolates the image  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from the type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe it is just me, but I would put the type aound the oval (like in the original) as that would unify the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two, however I didn't want to suggest that when I put up my first post (as I felt that it would not be  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting for you to be too similar to the original) so I wondered about modifying the oval instead. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, I like the modifications you made; they have lightened everything up considerably. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Italics in III are to my taste; they go very well with the other elements. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just a question, what kind of applications will this have other than letterhead etc. Will this be on signs,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wine bottles, menus?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And best of luck to the Greek team today!

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, these look great! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It occurs to me that by removing the &quot;sky&quot; the image has opened up, which really lets the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->type into the image.

		<div class="commentbody">This design has progressed very nicely, terrific job Christos. From your last posting I prefer the logo (in the grouping of five with no type) that is in the middle. It has the sky (?, I thought it was more landscape) and the land on the left breaks out of the rectangle shape. to me, it makes the overall design more interesting and dynamic. As for the type I like the version on the left, with the swash K's. One thing that looks off to me is the swash k next to the cap T and then small caps for hma. I don't read Greek so I'm assuming that is gramitically correct, but how would it look with thma all in small caps?</div>
