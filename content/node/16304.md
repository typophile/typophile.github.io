body: "I've been using Adobe Caslon Pro and noticed that the old style figures have
  these almost perfectly round 0's. Is this specific to Caslon? What's the history
  behind this glyph? I rather like it.\r\n\r\nI should note that I am but a humble
  undergrand student...so if this is obvious...be gentle. \r\n"

  body: this is a fairly typical form of the oldstyle zero. it is often seen as a
    unmodulated circular shape to distinguish it from the lowercase letter o.

    this same technique to differentiate between zero and lowercaseo o? "

  body: "According to Walter Tracy, 'Letters of Credit,' the round 0 in old style
    numerals follows scribal tradition, which was done to avoid confusion with the
    letter o. \r\n\r\nIncidently, as is usual in type design, what looks geometrical
    isn't. In Adobe Caslon old style 0 the inner circle is an oval, and consequently
    the vertical arches are fatter than the horizontal ones.   "

    (although its default figures are old-style), but it has this feature -- even
    in the sans."

  body: "On the roundness, I seem to recall something in Smeijers' Counterpunch about
    0 being traditionally cut using a drill (not a counterpunch) so that it truly
    was a perfect circle. I don't know whether, apart from the typographical convenience
    of distinguishing 0 and o, there was also some sort of almost mystical attraction
    to using a perfect circle to represent zero.\r\n\r\nI really like the circular
    and monoline 0, but I think I'm in a minority. The current fashion at least seems
    to be to use some other device to distinguish oldstyle 0 and o."

    me and never seems to resolve itself as part of the type forms to me. This is

    every page of a book. On smaller documents, however, i feel that it can often
    be the thing that livens up the page. \r\nI also like dashed zeros. Not enough
    typefaces have that."

  body: "I agree with H\xE9ctor here. Sometimes the weight is too light. But for it
    to work, the zero also must be not really uniform, but only appear to be so on
    first glance. Adobe Caslon--and the originals of William Caslon--are not uniform
    circles, but just give the impression of being so. \r\n\r\nThe 'bulls eye' ring,
    as Chris illustrates with his usual humor, is disturbing. To me the on-screen
    version of Georgia's 0, which looks circular, also works, as you can see in the
    following. Zero: 0; and oh: o. Alternating in a row: 0o0o0o   "

  body: Another technique to distingush lower-case zero from a lower-case o is what
    Hermann Zapf did with AMS Euler. He made the zero slightly egg shaped. Admittedly,
    Euler isn't a text face, but I think the idea has merit.
