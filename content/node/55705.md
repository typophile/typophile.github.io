  on a typeface design project for school. So this is the typeface I'm working on
  for school, currently these are all the letters I have finished in vectors and am
  moderately happy with. \r\n\r\nThe sketch at the bottom is what I've based the lower
  case off of. \r\n\r\nAny criticism would be a appreciated. Be ruthless. \r\n\r\n[[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v642/AdamJones0405/letters.jpg|sample

  body: 'I suppose originally when I sketched out the G I had envisioned it for use
    with large amounts of text/body copy. I think the idea I had in my head was a
    old style typeface with some modern mixed in. Now as I keep looking at my original
    sketch vs. what I''ve done with the lower case, it seems to have moved away from
    my original style. '

    moved away from what I wanted it to look like. I've started working on my sketches
    for the other letters and I've pretty much hit a wall with it. So I'm meeting
    with my prof tomorrow to discuss what I can do and get myself on the right track. "

    guidelines you should go through, especially about metrics, strokes contrast and
    weight, counters, serifs and figure proportions.\r\nI agree with you that the
    initial result has nothing to do with the original sketch \u2013BTW, it seems
    more interesting, and it would be the most if it was even rougher.\r\nOne more
    thing: <strong>trust your eyes</strong> better than geometry and math measurements;
    they can find here and there where strength and weakness are; type design seems
    to be a matter of modelling and shaping \u2013in the sense of sculpting\u2013
    more than of building.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: Reading 'The Stroke' is a good idea, and personally I wouldn't bother too
    much with the salt. Hrant doesn't like the theories described in it, but I did.
    Plus, using the very same theories as a basis, the students at Type & Media keep
    designing very nice typefaces.

  body: "Yes, very nice, salable typefaces. Kudos to them - that's no mean feat. But
    they are also very <em>safe</em> typefaces*, and not the way forward culturally.
    Something like Legato is.\r\n\r\n* Except for Klimax - that's awesome.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason I dislike so-called \"ductal logic\" isn't because of anything emotional*;
    it stems from my understandings surrounding reading. They may be wrong, but at
    least I have some and I use them as a basis, instead of the other way around (if
    that).\r\n\r\n* I can't say the same for GN.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Yeah, I understand your reasons, and I agree with them in a way. Especially
    when seeing something like Legato. But I also have a soft spot for typefaces which
    have that ductal logic very strongly, I don't know why, I just do. ;) That has
    nothing to do with legibility/readability, but purely aesthetics.

    invitation). And I think that's a very human preference, and one that has a relevant
    place in display setting. But for text face design, I have to force myself to
    see the problem.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
