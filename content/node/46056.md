  version of FontLab Studio on Mac OS X 10.5.2 (Intel).\r\nWhen I try to print from
  FontLab the program crashes.\r\nThe software is my own, academic purchase.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  familiar with this problem?\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is something obvious I have overlooked,
  any help much appreciated\r\n\r\n\r\nAndy"
