body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nI had come across a well detailed explanation on why Otl
  Aicher chose Univers over Helvetica when he designed the 1972 Munich Olympics. I
  don't remember if it was on the Internet or printed (maybe Markus Rathgeb's book
  \"Otl Aicher\"). Now I have scoured the web to no avail; I'm probably missing a
  keyword.\r\n\r\nAny information you are able to provide on Aicher's thought process
  of choosing Univers over Helvetica for the 1972 Munich Olympics would greatly be
  appreciated. Even though I'm primarily looking for Aicher's reasons, your insight
  is welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\nRG"

    thread</a>.\r\n\r\nPersonal insight: I worked with Otl Aicher during the development
    and release of Rotis. There was no mistaking his long term closeness and admiration
    of Adrian Frutiger and the Univers matrix."
