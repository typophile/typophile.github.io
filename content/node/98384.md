  \"must have\" books? Books you'd recommend in general?\r\n\r\nthanks."

    I don't know if he has a Typophile account, but let me alert him to this thread.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    so that's an option.\r\n\r\nI found this one book online called \u05E2\u05DC \u05D8\u05D9\u05E4\u05D5\u05D2\u05E8\u05E4\u05D9\u05D4

  body: "Oded mentioned Solomon Birnbaum's classic work on Hebrew palaeography. If
    this is an area of interest, there is now a number of substantial works on the
    development of mediaeval Hebrew script. Searches on 'mediaeval hebrew manuscript'
    should come up with good resources.\r\n\r\nRecently, I obtained a copy of Izzy
    Pludwinski's _Mastering Hebrew Calligraphy_, which seems to me a very good introduction,
    showing both norms and variations for the principal styles, and a good chapter
    on how to analyse historical styles."

  body: "An essential book on Hebrew type and design is by Ismar David. Anyone who
    seeks great books on Hebrew type and design should get it.  My copy belongs to
    Ari Davidoff (I lost my copy); Ari, you'll get back soon.\r\n\r\nAnother great
    collection is by his main \"secretary\", xxx xxx (I forget her name now), and
    type expert, Sol Malkoff. I will post it soon. The collection is like Ismar David's
    book: great Hebrew type samplers, some from wood type. Many of Hebrew wood designs
    have been lost. So, this collection is very important. Also, great articles by
    Malkoff."

    I own many of them listed here, and I may have an addition to make. But, I left
    most of them at the office. Will see tomorrow.

    all of these highly. I have also read and would recommend most of what was posted
    by Oded Ezer.\r\n\r\nYou can also find other books about Hebrew calligraphy. This
    knowledge will come in handy in type design, giving you a deeper understanding
    of the letters. Also reading about type design for other languages (and practicing
    some of these) will help when you get back to Hebrew. Hope this helps!"
