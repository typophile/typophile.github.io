body: "I suppose that every keyboard layout is capable of typing the 95 ASCII characters,
  since these are used by default in programming and such, but in some keyboards at
  first sight don't seem possible.\r\nI've heard that keyboards for non-Latin script
  can alternate to the latin script via some key or key sequence but I don't know
  any.\r\nI know that japanese keyboards have a clear way to alternate from the latin,
  hiragana, katakana, fullwidth and halfwith characters, but it uses an special layout
  of 106 keys.\r\nI've used and hebrew keyboard where Latin characters can be typed
  pressing Caps Lock, since Hebrew characters hasn't caps, but only caps Latin characters
  can be input.\r\nI have no idea how the Greek and Cyrillic keyboards work, and I'm
  curious to the Cyrillic one since it doesn't seem to include the ASCII number sign
  (#), (they use the n\xFAmero sing instead). \r\nRight now changing a keyboard layout
  to another thought the OS is easy, but I'm not sure if always was."
