  body: "I believe this is Carola Grotesk (H.Berthold and Bauer), also known as Boutique
    (Haas Type Foundry), which dates from the early 20th century. \r\n\r\nThe only
    somewhat faithful digital version (though seemingly no longer available) was from
    the less-than-reputable Castcraft Software Inc. under the name Boutique:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27506.html\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Boutique_4061.png]\r\n\r\nParatype
    created a version called Karolla. PT Karolla Narrow Bold comes awfully close to
    your sample (save for the C):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/karolla/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Karolla_6661.png]"

  body: "Edited:\r\nOpti Boutique is an accurate digitization of the metal font used
    in your Mexican publication. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OptiboutiqueOrigHaasBoutiqueInUse_3530.jpg]\r\nThe
    publication used Boutique by the Haas type foundry of Switzerland or Carola Grotesk
    of H.Berthold and Bauer, or a metal-type era clone. \r\nBTW the Paratype Karolla
    Narrow Bold, although similar, is a different design.\r\nAs for Opti fonts, they
    are font orphans and there is no legitimate way to acquire them.\r\nAs far as
    I can determine Opti Boutique was an original digitization by Opti rather than
    a clone of of digital work done elsewhere. Most of the Opti fonts were pirated
    clones.\r\nDon"
