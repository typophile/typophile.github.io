body: a while ago I made a trademark for <a href="http://www.klim.co.nz/content/logos_elizabeth.html">Elizabeth
  Horne</a>. I am now about to print a &#39;sale&#39; poster for their store window.
  dimensions are 530mm x 1400mm. Any comments? <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56444.gif"

  body: Kris, could you investigate using a bright promotional color rather than funerial
    black. Thats my only suggestion.

  body: The actual colour is more of a dark aubergine. The screenshot didn&#39;t quite
    register!

  body: It looks really somber to me. I would use something a little lighter. Even
    the dark aubergine you speak of sounds a little dark. It is really beautiful in
    itself- I like the stark contrast. It just doesn&#39;t fit the store. I would
    keep experimenting.

  body: That is an intersting comment, Sarah. As it goes, I have already printed them,
    and they are currently hanging in the store. The owners like them, and get lots
    of positive feedback on them. I would like to know why you think it doesn&#39;t
    fit the store. <BR> <BR>kris.

  body: Kris, can you take some photos of them hanging in the store? I always like
    to see stuff like this in use.

  body: Hi folks,  <BR> <BR>Sorry for being so slack, but I have been in the midst
    of moving house. I can&#39;t get you a photo, sorry, because the shop is in another
    town, which I don&#39;t visit often enough. I also don&#39;t have a digital camera.
    Bah. excuses!
