  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello typophilers,
I have been designing this typeface for quite some time. My intention was to create a very humanist design, that captures some of the classic features of Garalde and Venetian faces. 

Metrics and kerning still need some attention. I also just spotted some of my diagonals are producing uneven colour.

Before I start punctuation and other glyphs. I would appreciate any comments that you guys may have.

Thanks
-M Foley

		<div class="commentbody">I love Gill Sans, so I like this a lot.  I like the right-angle terminal at the top of the G and the bottom of the C. You've tried to do the same on the top of the C, and the S, c, and s, but it's too subtle there -- even at very large sizes, it just looks smudgy.  And why not make the curves in J, a, e, j, 2, 3 and 5 terminate in the same way?   The rounded terminals of the f, the ear on the g, the r, 4, and 7 look horrible. They really don't match the feel of the rest of the font.  The zero is too wide compared to the other numbers.  The ear on the 1 is too short -- should be two or three times as tall.  The S, s, and 5 look like they are about to tip over to the right.  The 8 should be more asymetrical -- the top should be smaller than the bottom.

I like the slight curve at the ends of the lowercase verticals, but you seem to have only halfway done it on the q.  I really like the open P, 6, and 9. 

Hope that helps. :)

Glyphobet: Thank you for the very indepth critique. It has certainly helped me out. I also didn't particularly like the terminals. I thought I could justify them by slightly incising my design. In the end, the terminals still didn't work.

bpotstra: I guess it has taken me about three months so far. I have attempted a san serif three times. I don't worry about the time it has taken me. In total I would say around two hundred hours. I try to work slowly, it helps me concentrate harder on the areas that need the most attention. 

I have have attempted to move away from the Gill, Johnston look. To help give the design more contrast, I have incised the stroke endings, allowing a little more contrast. I also wanted to make sure I avioded Optima. My type face is mainly based off Galliard.
