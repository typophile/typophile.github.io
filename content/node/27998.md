body: This is my body of work from my first Illustration class, ever. Thought I'd
  share the trials and tribulations of different mediums with the community. I enjoyed
  the class thoughroughly and will most likely take the second iteration of the class
  before I graduate in June. Questions and comments will gladly be entertained.
