  body: By the way, I know Typophile search isn't working, but you can search for
    previous IDs from Google by entering, for example, "site:typophile.com syfy".
    That's how I found the above link. Friendly tip. :)

    Neo Sans:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/neo-sans/\r\n\r\nor DIN Schriften\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/din-schriften/\r\n\r\nand
    not given it a second thought."

  body: Stephen, thank you very much. I've searched "syfy" on typophile forums, but
    I was naive and ignorant enough not to know that Typophile search is not working.
    I will do in the future.

  body: No worries. I'm sure it'll be back working soon, but in the meantime that
    Google trick is a nice little work-around.
