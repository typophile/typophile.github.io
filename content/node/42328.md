  into using <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=565&subpage=viewfontspecimens\"
  target=\"_blank\">Burbank</a> from House Industries. However, it appears (I'm still
  waiting clarification) that it will cost us $7500 to embed into our Flash experience.
  I should also mention that this site needs to be translatable into 18 or so different
  languages, so a robust character set is needed.\r\n\r\nThe client feels that this
  price is too steep, and I'm wondering if anyone could point me in the direction
  of a similar typeface that would have a similar feel.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    not slated for another two years or so. As of right now we are only launching
    in western based languages.

  body: You won't find a font like this that has both Latin and Chinese characters,
    I'm afraid. Will have to use a different typeface for the Chinese side.

    has one, for instance:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5457\r\n\r\nI
    agree, you're probably better off just buying two typefaces...one for roman and
    one for Chinese.\r\n\r\n"
