body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Until now I used to draw my fonts directly in the computer but
  I have now a new idea for a font and want to draw them on paper before scanning
  them into the computer. <BR>What paper do you use for that? Ofcourse I need linings
  and a certain grid. Do you use transparant paper on a basis underground? <BR> <BR>Can
  someone shed some light in my darkness? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren

  body: Hi everybody, <BR> <BR>thanks for the fast reply. That was exactly what I
    needed. I had something similar in my head, but it&#39;s always better the ask
    the more experienced ones.  <BR>I tend towards Josephs and Hrants method. I like
    to scetch and make drawings, now I will have to do it for my typefaces. I think
    I will also use up a lot of paper, therefor the simplest way is the best way.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m on the lookout for a light box, but they are hard to get. I imagine
    that&#39;s very easy if you want to reproduce serifs and stemwidths. I would like
    to make the font as far ready on paper as I can, and than digitize it. I will
    see very fast what works best for me. <BR> <BR>Hrant, nice font by the way. <BR>
    <BR>Have a nice weekend, <BR>Ren

  body: Hi Tony, <BR> <BR>would be great if you could send me your directions. Than
    I can descide to build one myself. The one I found is not that expensive, about
    50 EURO. With a homebuilt light box I can increase the size a little. <BR> <BR>Ren

    rarely simple digitizations of calligraphy.
