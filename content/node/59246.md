  which is two column with 7/8 word per line justified serif type. I'm not using hyphenation
  so there are considerable rivers. At the moment I am not using any letter spacing,
  it's all justified using word spacing. \r\n\r\nIt's too large a job to set every
  paragraph individually - does anyone have any suggestions for reducing the rivers
  (should I be setting up 10/20% maximum letterspacing setting in inDesign justification
  etc?)\r\n\r\nMany Thanks"

    that in first...)\r\n\r\nSeriously though, you can have justification, you can
    have a short measure, and you can have no hyphenation \u2013\_it's just that rivers
    in the settting will be a natural consequence of these factors; the quickest way
    to reduce the rivers is to get rid of one of these parameters (as Florian points
    out)."
