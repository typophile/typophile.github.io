Trying to keep an eye in printed materials also from &rsquo;60s, &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s, I think the list is:</p>
<p>Times New Roman
Helvetica (Arial as a variant introduced with Windows dissemination)
Courier New
Palatino
Bookman
Souvenir
Futura
Frutiger
Copperplate Gothic
Garamond (in its many variations of weight and style)</p>
<p>Other relevant ones: Century Schoolbook, Century OldStyle, Sabon, Commercial Script, Minion, Avant Garde, Brush Script, Caslon, Eras, Bembo, Gill Sans and Univers.</p>
<p>(My perception is based on Latin America, US and UK printed materials.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like your idea of &ldquo;famous fonts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>By focusing on fonts that were honored and acclaimed (rather than just being used a lot), it narrows the field to fonts that were well-respected and discussed, and which had something of a story and aesthetic theory attached to them, and whose designers may even have been known by name, in the professional fields of graphic design and typography.</p>
<p>It also means fonts that were used by typographers and designers to create layouts, not merely being used by readers (end-users).</p>
<p>You may have to say something about fame vs. notoriety.
Certain typefaces which were much discussed were more vilified than respected, e.g. Souvenir, ITC Garamond, Comic Sans and Papyrus.</p>
<p>Certainly Helvetica and Univers were central to design theory, as practised and taught in the late 20th century.
And Futura (although designed in the 1920s).</p>
<p>That raises a good benchmark: did a typeface have a book written about it, or its designer?
(Renner, by Christopher Burke, centres on Futura).</p>
<p>Some of the best-known typefaces were well-known because their foundries were great publicists, or because their designers were well-known.</p>
<p>For instance, in the 1990s, Emigre magazine, published by Emigre foundry, was the focus of an intellectual movement, in which faces like Barry Deck&rsquo;s Template and Zuzana Lickpo&rsquo;s Matrix became iconic. Dead History was also quite famous, theoretically, although little used.</p>
<p>Neville Brody&rsquo;s Industria was symbolic, in many ways, of design in the 1980s and 1990s, first as the face of the influential magazine he art directed (The Face), then as one of the most-used early DTP faces. &ldquo;The Graphic Language of Neville Brody&rdquo; was a best-selling graphic design book, further cementing the fame of Industria and its designer.</p>
<p>Similarly, Avant Garde was famous because of the iconic (that word again), eponymous magazine, and its much-awarded designer, Herb Lubalin.</p>
<p>And Meta, by Erik Spiekermann, perhaps owes something of its fame (quite apart from its popularity in use) to its designer&rsquo;s career and celebrity as a graphic designer, author, conference speaker, and founder of FontShop.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Georgia and Verdana are landmark typefaces, IMHO. These were a concerted effort to address mostly screen use, the Web, and across the board interoperability. Something out of the Emigre fold is also landmark. Add to that Garamond, Caslon, Bodoni, and Baskerville, which were all quite a bit older but workhorse types used for quite a bit.  Bodoni more for display than text. I would also add OCR, Times and Futura</div>
