body: "just a quick question. For a simple book design i am obliged to use times.
  I think Plantin would be a subtly better option. Is this just my opinion (caused
  by the over-use of times?) or do i actually get the thing right for once? The book
  needs a regular, an italic and a bold italic (possibly also smallcaps) in 10pt.\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your response."

    sort of thing most people want to stare at for long stretches of time. And the
    italic is sort of ugly."

  body: 'I agree, the distinction is subtle (do you know how the faces are related?),
    and I think Plantin would be better. I think it has a little more character, and
    its sturdy serifs and color make it more comfortable for reading. Times is another
    face that looks spiky in digital format. Get the size and leading right and Plantin
    will look classic. The advantage you have is that they are similar in proportion,
    and few laypersons will know the difference. '

    I think they both look truly awful, and of course are overused by the formatters
    of Word documents.

    instead of Times New Roman, especially when printing stuff in the office environment

    from the Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n\"On 2006-11-20, Times newspaper unveiled Times Modern,
    as the successor of Times Classic.[9] Designed for improving legibility in smaller
    font sizes, it uses 45-degree angled bracket serifs. The font was published by
    Monotype as EF Times Modern. The font was designed by Research Studios, led by
    Ben Preston, Deputy Editor of The Times, in partnership with Neville Brody, former
    art director of The Face, and lead designer on Actuel, City Limits and Arena magazines.
    The design team included Ben Preston, David Driver, Mike Prowse, Chris Davalle,
    Kathleen Wyatt Research Studios: Neville Brody, Jon Hill, Luke Prowse.\"\r\n\r\nSince
    Dux = Luke Prowse [[http://www.typophile.com/node/29521|drew Times Modern]] he
    was evidently indulging in a bit of wry inside humor that I totally didn't get

    And the italic is sort of ugly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can't agree with that. Times is a
    fine face for books. It is extremely readable (in the right size, measure, margins
    and leading). And ugliness of the italics is a designers opinion (with which I
    fail to agree). Many, many books (generally 20 years or more ago) were set in
    it, and I have never heard of people having trouble reading it \"for long stretches
    of time.\"\r\n\r\nAll that said, I will agree that the font is overused, and therefore
    would not use it unless forced to somehow. But it is not a poor font based on
    other merits."

    several \"Times\" versions to choose from, and when a typographer works out how
    a book is to look, and looks at all the versions and chooses the right one, a
    fine looking book can be made.\r\n\r\nThe thing most people don't \"want to stare
    at for long stretches of time\" is poorly-set type. Do not decide against Times
    or any other typeface because it is overused. Choose typefaces that are right
    for the project. That's the only criterion.\r\n\r\npowers"

    and snappiest Times on the market, and being able to shift globally to oldstyle
    figures makes it right for books too. It's the only one with OSFs, as far as I
    know. But that's if you have to use Times at all; it is, after all, the most over-exposed
    typeface on earth now.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Plantin is choosing between the
    light weight, which is too light for reliable use under 11 pt, or the regular
    weight, which is a little too black and clumps up. But I love the look and proportions
    for Plantin and always have. Depends on your point size and the paper. Plantin
    Light works with smooth or coated stock but not below 11pt. The toothier the stock
    the better the regular weight looks.\r\n\r\nBe sure to buy your OpenType Plantin
    from Monotype...they have OSFs; Adobe's OT does not."
