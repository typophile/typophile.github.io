<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>The logo I have done is for an industrial park in a small village in Germany. The park consists of some larger companys like an engineering company or a window-builder but also a gym, chips chops and a children's playground. The industrial park would like to print some flyers in a few days when they have an open day! They dont want to make advertisement for themselves but for the companys which are in the park. But therefor they first need a logo. However they want to win some new customers/lessee too.
I made a new font for their logo. It has rounded corners that looks friendly but not too childish and has large counters. For the icon I made a simplified depot which is almost similar to the german road sign for an industrial park.
Any thoughts would be very helpful especially on the spacing :)

<div class=commentbody>I would say that BO of Borchen is just about right in terms of kerning and that should act as the basis of the kerning for the rest, nearly every other pair needs to be a touch tighter. I wonder if the icon is too industrial (as opposed to retail), but I would amend the radii of the curves around the roof, maybe use the sharp corners on the inside and rouunded on the outside.

<div class=commentbody>Hey Tim,
thank you for your hints. I changed the logo a bit that it doesnt look like a logo for a heavy industries park anymore. Unfortunately I didnt had time to make the kerning yet.

So! Any criticism is welcome :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the shape of the mark in the first example (the factory silhouette) better than the cubes. You might want to give it a 3D treatment like in the left hand side of the latest post.

<div class=commentbody>Hey Lex,
I also like the shape factory more, but it is a bit too industrial for the park. There are amongst others an engineering company, a window-builder but also a gym, chips chops and a children’s playground. The shape of a factory would disregard the gym and so on. The park has more than just heavy industry. But maybe I try what you mentioned.

<div class=commentbody>I like the open cubes. I might expand on the cubes and make them multidimensional looking as expansive. I would make the type a different weight than the mark. You need some separation, make it bolder or lighter. Everything feels the same weight. Make priorities to your message. Ask yourself what is most important. Is it the graphic (I doubt it) is it the name (I think so) and the location (a throw away). Make each element stronger or less strong to stress the message.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you all for your hints so far. I send them the logos with two cubes. It is something like a small pitch for what i done that. So I will start working on it when they choose one of my logos. If they want me to change something on it!?

<div class=commentbody>I would have a look at the perspective of the smaller box, in comparison with the larger box it is wider and the lefthand side is going toward a different vanishing point. I do like the concept of the new mark though.

<div class=commentbody>I just got the message!
They dont want my concept. Im not very sad about that because I have a new concept for a font now. Im just a bit amused when I take a look at the designs that won. Taht happens if you arent able to be on location and the presentation only happens via e-mail :)
Thank you once again for the hints you all gave me. Greetings: Steven</div>
