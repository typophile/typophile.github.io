  logo was made with a generic illustrator \"ink brush.\" I am looking for some fonts
  that would pair nicely that are ink-like, curvaceous, not mocking asian characters
  or look like Wonton. \r\n\r\nA script or sans would work nicely. Any suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nTyp\r\n"
