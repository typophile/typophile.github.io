  but no fail. Maybe it was set to close that it formed a script or so, so those sites
  couldn't read them as font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GD-typeface_3750.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
  if anyone know and care to share what typeface this is? :)\r\nThank you."

    you must prepare the image by separating each letter manually and ensure you have
    a vertical white strip between the letters.\r\n\r\nPS2: I found it using Find
