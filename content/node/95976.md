  body: The saturation of type snobbery is overblown by the general public. "Fonts"
    are a universal humor shorthand for "stuff that doesn't matter." Having any opinions
    at all about type makes you a type snob. It <em>offends</em> people that someone
    thinks about typefaces. People who readily acknowledge a common understanding
    of what is good or bad taste in music, and who will pick apart the slightest deviations
    from their ideals in a person's physical appearance, will deliberately use "hated"
    fonts "just to piss off hipsters."

    offends others by his/her air of superiority.  A snob can be knowledgeable or
    can be clueless; it's their attitude that makes them a snob.

  body: Knowing that a "font" is a particular style and or type size "within" a "typeface"
    makes one a bit snobbish I guess....Most use the word font where the word typeface
    should be used. But of course all here already know that ;) ;) ;)

    folks even when it isn't the correct term.  \r\n\r\nAnd this has nothing to do
    with typography, but my pet peeve is folks that use \"less\" when they should
    use \"fewer\" (such as \"I have less books than I used to\"). I even see well-educated
    folks making that mistake, so I guess the rules have just changed over time."

    designing type and making fonts, the distinction is useful and aids clear communication;
    that isn''t snobbery.'

    has long looked down its nose at \"trade\".\r\nFor the longest time, book types
    have held the privileged position.\r\nFor instance, 19 th century sans serif (and
    other commercial genres) were omitted from type histories until quite recently.\r\nSimilarly,
    the historicist movement of the early 20th century, which completely dominated
    graphic design, has played second fiddle in most design narratives to modernism,
    which was rarely seen in mass media."

    get that. But my point is that ordinary people see the word \"font\" much more
    than \"typeface\", and that's even true when they look at the names of the places
    selling type. \"Font\" is also much more common than \"typeface\" on computer
    user interfaces and in application menus. Microsoft Word doesn't have a \"Typeface\"
    menu, it has a \"Font\" menu.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it's not an important distinction,
    just that \"typeface\" has become somewhat marginalized compared to \"font\",
    whether we like it or not, and that it's probably too late to do anything about
    it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I don't think the word \"type\" is in the same danger."

  body: Speaking for myself, I am always going to regard "typeface" as a practical
    description for a design family of raised mechanical letters that press or strike
    directly against paper. The term is useful and correct as it relates to letterpress
    or typewriter printing, but it is not more educated or professional than "font"
    when applied to photo or digital typography.

    a font is a set of letters of a particular style, in a particular size: e.g.,
    10 pt. Clarendon Bold. 12 pt Clarendon Bold would be another font. Since the digital
    versions can render the typeface in a very wide variety of different sizes, \"font\"
    simply doesn't work..."
