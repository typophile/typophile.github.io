body: Hi, <BR> <BR>This is a logo &#43; 2 colors &#34;outdoor street&#34; poster&#40;printed
  on white plastic&#41; &#43; tshirts for a &#34;small&#34; rock Festival to be held
  this month. <BR> <BR>The &#34;dirty rock&#34; logo for the festival was done last
  year and has migrated to this years event joined with an 8. The red &#43; black
  colors are also final ones &#40;same as last years&#41;. This year I wanted to give
  a really rock/headbanging mood to the event, and traced a typical rock pose and
  added some amount of long hair to it. The tshirt has another element on the back
  featuring a vocalist but I guess I&#39;ll drop this illustration and keep the whole
  image to the main illustration. There is also the backstage/staff pass that has
  the poster element along with the Cercal Rock logo. <BR> <BR>As for the poster,
  as I said it will be printed on white plastic and will be placed outdoor, so it&#39;s
  important to have a memorable poster with it&#39;s info &#40;event &#43; logo &#43;
  date &#43; bands&#41; &#34;readable&#34; or on the best of it&#39;s purpose to get
  the drivers attention. <BR> <BR>The white stripe on the bottom is for the sponsers
  &amp; support logos. <BR> <BR>I wish I had budget for Psy/ops Oxtail. Maybe next
  year <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: 'Ah, wait! Stop the presses! A minor detail: I think you should try to work
    out the left side of the guy&#39;s guitar - it seems a little bit strange.  <BR>
    <BR>Other than that, congratulations it looks very nice and &#34;rocky&#34;! <BR>

  body: That happens all the time with photograph based vector silhouettes, some shapes
    just don&#39;t look right in the silhouette, even though they&#39;re just like
    in the picture...

  body: yes I agree. I use this method a lot and have to draw &#34;imaginary lines&#34;
    to get a more easy shape that the eyes can understand. Obrigado <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
