  body: ' Nathaniel - A lot of people have tried this type of dotted typeface &#40;myself
    included&#41;, and I think you&#39;ve got some cool &#40;read: different&#41;
    forms. Somebody did it first, I&#39;m not sure who, but yours is certainly a fresh
    take. It&#39;s hard to see exactly what&#39;s happening with each letter, but
    if you can post a Flash sample, it&#39;d be easier to give feedback on the individual
    letters. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: ' Nathaniel - favorite forms: the lc &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39; <BR> <BR>least
    favorite &#39;s&#39; and &#39;k&#39; <BR> <BR>this could be a usable specialty
    face, but in my humble opinion it could be improved. <BR> <BR>you wanted gentle
    but honest criticism, so the main thing: <BR> <BR> I would clean up the face.
    Spraytrix light looks like a mishmash of diff. circular shapes but none of them
    look clean. The repeated shape could be a circle, square, star, whatever, but
    clean and uniform seems like it would work better than misshapen. <BR> <BR>it&#39;s
    not a bad first attempt so keep on trying new stuff, <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: ' I feel the opposite, bj. It&#39;s the irregularity <BR>of the dots that
    makes Spraytrix different from <BR>the other dotted grid fonts. I really believe
    <BR>the Light is marketable as a worn face printed <BR>by some arcane machine.

  body: Great!, the irregualrity gives the font a human look. It&#39;s more like a
    humanistic interpretation of those very rigid forms. The difference between the
    light &amp; bold is good; it makes the typeface diverse, and interesting to watch.
    It gives the typeface a certain personality. <BR> <BR>I love those capitals;the
    S &amp; K are beautiful. <BR> <BR>I think the next step is to transform it to
    a typeface. Spacing, Kerning etc... <BR>&amp; designing al the other elements;
    all the punctuations etc. <BR> <BR>the typedesigner &#39;Peter van Blokland&#39;
    designed in the early eighties the font &#39;vijfzeven&#39;. Look at it at &#34;<A
    HREF="http://xml.petr.com/buro/products/vijfzeven//nl" TARGET="_top">http://xml.petr.com/buro/products/vijfzeven//nl</A>&#34;
    <BR>or try finding at &#34;http://www.petr.com&#34; There are a lot of similarities
    between his and your design. Though his font is more cleaned up &#40;as what bj
    suggested&#41;, I think you should try to keep it more rough. <BR> <BR>Making
    it clean is easy, keeping it rough, but also usefull is the tricky part. <BR>
    <BR>good luck <BR> <BR>&amp; try to do what you think is best <BR> <BR>&#40;it&#39;s
    your design, in the end&#41;

    large so i made it heavier. Bold versions <BR>are just to add a bit of versitility.
    I like fonts you  <BR>can overlay to get 3D/misregistered styles. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1690.jpg"
