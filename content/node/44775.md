body: "Hi Folks!\r\n\r\nWe have an urgent question belonging to PC fonts.\r\nWe have
  derived a font (working on Mac FontLab) and want to create a font usable on PC.\r\nI
  have found so long options fpr creating the classic Mac suitcase fonts, another
  for Macintosh TrueType.\r\nBut I didn\u2019t find anything for making PC fonts (actually
  we tried the Mac TrueType- doesn\u2019t run on PC)\r\nWhat is the solution?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so far!\r\nStefan"
