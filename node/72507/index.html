  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I'm working on a set of packagings in different languages and I'd need to know what difficulties I could find in terms of type, composition, if it's written from left to right or top to bottom.  If there's a wiki or a site where I can read information about it please let me know. Here's the list of the languages and what I know so far:

- greek: left to right, no problems with Myriad

- indonesian: from left to right, can work it out as english, no problem

- corean: top to bottom, no problems in terms of type but wondering how to work the text direction

- hindu: not sure if it's left to right, problems with type

- thai: not sure if it's left to right, problems with type

- chinese: from top to bottom and columns from left to right, I've tried with different types and I still keep getting the empty squares of missing character. If I move the text from horizontal to vertical in illustrator will it have the proper order?

- malasian: left to right, no problems

- arabic: from right to left, I have the world ready illustrator template and I can work it out with myriad

- japanese: top to bottom, no problems with this type:Adobe 명조 Std M but wondering how to work the text direction

- turkish: left to right, no problems with myriad

- tagalo: left to right, no problems


Thanks a lot!

By the way, the "japanese" font you mentioned seems to have a korean name. A Japanese font isn't any font which contains a full set of hiragana and katakana, it needs to contain a large set of Chinese Characters (Kanji) in the proper Japanese style. I'm not familiar with japanese typography, however.

		<div class="commentbody">What font are you using for the Chinese text? It is apparently missing some characters that you need. Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese use different fonts, so you need to choose the correct font for the writing system.

Regarding some of your other questions, although vertical writing is traditional for Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, horizontal left-to-right writing is now normal in Simplified Chinese and Korean, and in a context like international packaging, horizontal left-to-right writing is entirely acceptable in Japanese and Traditional Chinese also. You do not need to set any of them vertically.

The Hindi language is written in Devanagari script, which is left-to-right but has complex shaping behavior. The Thai script is also written from left to right and has complex shaping behavior. The World Ready template may help with both, but they will need to be checked carefully.</div>

However, I encourage you to try the excellent Nanum Gothic, available at [[http://hangeul.naver.com/nanumgothic.nhn]] for free under the Open Font Licence.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Are you really sure you want to mix a Latin font with the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text? If you use the full-width Latin characters in the East Asian fonts the text will automatically “justify” itself since the full-width Latin glyphs have the same width as the other characters. The box size of a character, called the “Q”, is the same as other characters for full-width Latin and punctuation in East Asian fonts. It looks very weird to me to have characters not lined up in a perfect grid.

The annoying thing is of course that the Latin glyphs in most East Asian fonts are fairly lousy, although the Adobe offerings and the Hiragino family have good Latin designs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Instead, the full-width latin characters inside running chinese text look really ugly.

Some fonts (for example, the free WenQuanYi ZhengHei Mono, or SimSun that comes with Windows), do provide monospaced Latin text at the width of a half grid. I personally see no good in gridding latin text, and would rather just use proportional Latin text, though. (but again, I'm just a Chinese guy who does not learn a lot about typography.)

By the way, does Hiragino Sans contain features about character width? I heard that Hiragino Mincho Pro supports latin character width to be "full", "proportional" and "half", while supporting more options for numbers.

Finally, would you consider using full-width brackets?

Latin version: ()[]{}
Full-width version: （）［］｛｝

I'm not sure whether using them is good, but they are worth a try...</div>

I have to strongly disagree here, at least for Korean. You don't want the letters to line up in a perfect grid unless you are intentionally going for the typewriter/fixed-width look. Korean uses spaces between words that are typically less than half the width of the hangul letters, so even a Korean text containing no numerals or Latin text will never line up in a grid in good typographic practice. The full-width and half-width forms are never used in horizontally-set Korean typography. In fact, hangul letters have uniform width in most available fonts only because of technical limitations. Some newer text faces for Korean have different widths for different hangul letters.

And for what it's worth, for the few products I have at home using Chinese-only packaging, I don't see a perfect grid either. It may be different for Chinese novels and the like where Latin letters and numerals are rare.

For this project, it's best to use the same Latin font for all the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text, as Alexandra is already doing, while of course taking care to harmonize the weights and adjusting the vertical alignment if needed.</div>

Right now I'm taking it one step at a time and trying to see if the text in the packs I'm working on matches the translation texts I've been given. These designs are only for printing mock-ups to be shown to potential clients but either way, if you make the effort to design something in a totally different language at least it should look right.

Adobe arabic is working really well for arab and Apple gothic for korean. Or at least it seems to me!

In terms of gridding, I'd rather not try to mess around with characters I've never worked with before because I'm sure I won't be able to make them look ok. In the other hand, I expect the client to give me specific indications of composition and grammar.

The big issue here is I don't know how to read the texts. I recently worked with polish, rumanian and other eastern languages and although I don't know the exact words I'm able to adjust the type because it looks almost as the characters of the languages I speak. Has any of you faced something like this before? Have you ended up contacting designers from other countries?
