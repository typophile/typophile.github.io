  haven't been conclusive even though below fonts don't seem to be very exotic; part
  of the problem might be that the specimen derive from texts imprint, thus figures
  are somewhat imprecise.\r\n\r\nad 1.: IV might just be an extended version of font
  II\r\n           with I it is obviously th R and the K that stand out\r\n\r\nad
  2.: 2 and 1 III. / 3. are similar but not the same, if one looks closely. (i am
  somewhat amazed that\r\n           during an  era of fierce patent battles corporate
  branding seems not to have been a priority)\r\n\r\nad 4.: II. has some very interesting
  Bs and Rs\r\n\r\nad 5.: the A certainly hints to a condensed cheltenham; the R,
  the 3, the a and the iin the shape of a \r\n           minoan pillar are way off
  however\r\n\r\nmay i say: good hunting?! :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11111_5017.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/222222_5112.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3333_4066.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/444_3485.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/55555555_3907.jpg]"
