  body: "If there is one then lots of Japanese designers is ignoring them. \r\n\r\nfrom
    what I know, basically it's cap Y with the first cross stroke touching the arm.\r\n\r\nbut
    since I didn't go to school in japan I am not 100% sure (95% maybe)"

  body: "The yen symbol was invented overseas by Western journalists who needed a
    symbol to use in financial articles. At the time, typewriters were the main writing
    tool in use, so something that could easily be typed \u2014 a Y followed by a
    backspace and a hyphen or equal sign \u2014 became the convention. Thus, there
    is no official description of \xA5 any more than there is an official description
    for $ or @ or &.\r\n\r\nIn Japan itself, the \xA5 is not used terribly often,
    being essentially a Latin typographic symbol; and it does not appear on currency.
    Instead, the ideogram \u5186 is used. This character also means \"circle\" and
    has the same origin as the character for the Chinese yuan.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    \"dollar\" can be written \u5F17 in Japanese, a rather clever innovation since
    it is otherwise rarely used and resembles a dollar sign."
