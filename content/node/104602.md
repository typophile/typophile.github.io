  body: "FontWorld discontinued as we knew it. I founded Font World, Inc. with my
    late father and my late brother, Mark, in 1989. Different corporate incarnations
    of Font World, Inc. transpired many times over the years until last year, when
    Mark passed away from a long sickness at an early age. He was well loved, and
    will be greatly missed\r\n\r\nA new corporate incarnation brings many of FontWorld's
    and GoHebrew's qualities and products to the public at the under construction
    web site, called: www.fontsfurnitureandmore.com.\r\n\r\nAdobe InDesign ME can
    be had by downloading the latest version of Adobe InDesign CC from www.adobe.com.
    The Hebrew user must however first edit the preferences in the Adobe download
    program to enable Hebrew or Arabic text processing. This is explained in the Adobe
    Support Forum for Adobe InDesign for Hebrew text input. I will post the specific
    instructions here soon.\r\n\r\nAdobe offers substantial educational discounts.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have any technical questions, you can email them to me at info@fontsfurnitureandmore.com.\r\n"

    Dov Isaacs, Nov 3, 2013 12:42 AM   in reply to gohebrew1390 Report\r\nOK. The
    first thing you do is to uninstall InDesign 9.\r\n \r\nIf you want the English-Hebrew
    version (the equivalent of the old ME versions), you change the language preference
    in the Adobe installer to English-Hebrew and then reinstall InDesign. If you want
    only Hebrew, you set the language preference to Hebrew.\r\n \r\n(I assume that
    this is being installed by the Adobe Application Manager for the Creative Cloud!)\r\n
    \r\n          - Dov\r\n \r\nPS:     Same procedure for Illustrator and Photoshop!"

  body: "Creative Suite ME or InDesign ME is now defunct. Perhaps, you seek an older
    version. The drawback though may be that they are not compatible with newer versions
    of operating systems. Many older versions of software programs can not be run
    on newer versions of operating systems. For example, since there were ME versions
    of  Creative Suite or InDesign, many versions of Macintosh and Windows operating
    systems have been released.\r\n\r\nI have used the very latest versions of Creative
    Suite or InDesign with the Hebrew right-to-left features enabled. I have found
    these newer versions able to everything the ME versions could do, and much more.
    New versions of Creative Suite or InDesign are of course much better than the
    older ME versions.\r\n\r\nRemember however to enable these features BEFORE you
    download these later versions from Adobe, as explained earlier by Dov Isaacs."
