  body: I do not think that we can. We do not share standard encoding files, or in
    some cases, even agree on what glyphs constitute support for languages. And trying
    to create standards will no doubt attract advocates for constructed and fantasy
    languages like Esperanto and Klingon, which are of questionable use at best, and
    do not necessarily have orthographies that have been agreed upon by users. Then
    there will be the nationalist arguments over the names of certain languages claimed
    by bordering nations. I expect that the hassle would mean only a few designers
    would even see the process through, and plenty more will just ignore it.

    to MetaPlus; best thing that happened to me that year (what year? can\u2019t remember\u2026)."

    termed \"Expert\" fonts."

    CE suffix (Central European).  Helvetica CE for example.

  body: "As In recall, the term \"Pro\" came about years ago in the early opentype
    era when Adobe was retro-fitting their legacy fonts with the old \"Expert sets\".
    The name was pulled out of the thinking that the only people who ever used the
    Expert Sets were design or publishing professionals.  It was also only 3 letters
    long.\r\nSeveral years ago, I was asked by SoTA to write an article for their
    supposedly annual \"Interrobang\" publication on OpenType.  They never published
    it for some mysterious reason which I have ever been privy to.  Part of it addressed
    the \"Pro\" question.  I will try to dig up the old file and post the \"pro\"
    related part of it here if anyone is interested."

    term.</cite>\r\n\r\nThen we should probably educate our customers better about
    these terms. Often such information are missing on foundry websites or buried
    deep with the support section. \r\nTo me, \"Light\", \"Basic\"/\"Standard\", \"Pro\"/\"Premium\"
    are pretty universal terms for separating different versions of software products
    or bundles. Coming up with even more new abbreviations would only make things
    worse. "

    latin support. Some mistook that for meaning a font had rich typographic OT features,
    others took it to mean non-latin support.\r\n\r\nAs I remember, 'Pro' was used
    to imply that the OT font had 'some' additional OT features incorporated into
    it to distinguish from other standard fonts. The only way a user could find out
    'what those features' where, was to use the font and poke around to see what OT
    features where available from within an application.\r\n\r\nThe 'Pro' at the end
    of font name meant nothing. Some understood it to mean 'Professional', whatever
    that means.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's the whole problem with the way we all name stuff.
    Myself included. We are all guilty of this practice.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that
    at least within the 'typophile' group, we could all discuss the entire 'font naming'
    structure and come up with guidelines that we can all follow. At least, come to
    some sort of general consensus, and try to clarify what all these terms should
    mean.\r\n\r\nIf we don't, who will?\r\n\r\nHere is previous link with some of
    my other concerns. Thank you.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/88327"

    Keegan\u2014 You say to use \"ML\" for 'multi languages. Not a bad idea. But,
    what 'multi languages' are we talking about.\r\n\r\nI know what 'greek' or 'cyrillic'
    means after the font name. But what does 'ML' imply? It's not clear.\r\n\r\nIf
    we do this, and I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but then we have to supply

    or 'expanded' by the numbers alone. Maybe, down-the-road, we can start to drop
