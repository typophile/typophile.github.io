body: "I've been wanting for some time to somehow combine my love for movies and posters
  (ok, I'm also writing my thesis on that subject :), but all that \"alternative movie
  posters\" thing seemed too obvious and trendy (many great designs, though). That's
  when the idea of doing an (educational?) \"Who's who in a film crew\" poster series
  came to my mind.\r\n\r\nI remember having lots of discussions with friends, after
  the credits of a movie rolled, on things like \"Well, what does a producer really
  do in a movie?\" - and I didn't really know how to explain it, either. But through
  some wiki-consulting :) I tried to find what is the core of each profession, and
  then present it visually, with just a few simple words of explanation...\r\n\r\nThere
  are six posters for now; new ones possibly on the way...\r\nWould like your feedback
  on these ones, though. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenwriter_novi_okvir_4876.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DoP_novi_6219.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FilmEditor_novi_6178.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FoleyArtist_novi_6655.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MatteArtist_novi_3737.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Producer_novi_4353.jpg]"

  body: Me too. I admire the fact that you have limited the number of colours (and
    the way you handle it). Good work!

    to give it a try. It did make the process harder, but also more fun. :) "

    Key Grip, etc? :)
