  highly condensed sans fonts.\r\n\r\nI posted this a long time ago but an re-posting

  body: "I think the top counter of /A/ needs to be bigger, whether by lowering the
    crossbar or spreading the vertex or some combination of the two. You could also
    spread the top vertices of /M/ to help even out the counters there, too.\r\nYou
    might consider extending the ends of /C/S/c/s/ to reduce the admitted white space."

  body: "Take a little more care in positioning your diacritics consistently. The
    diereses in particular are scattered all over the place. \xEB looks like the right
    height to use as a model for the others.\r\n\r\nThe percent and the perthousand
    should be of the same design. But that percent... well, let's not talk about it.
    The perthousand is better but still a bit weird. Consider shorter o's that are
    not as scaled down."

    I'll post a revise in a few.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\ndglen"

  body: seems like, optically, the descender loop and the x-height bowl of the lowercase
    /g/ could be switched. I don't know if this breaks technical rules but the vertical
    weight seems top heavy.

  body: "Your diacritics is really, really bad. But as I come from a language that
    don't use diacritics other then in some loan words, I won't make any suggestions
    about what to do with them.\r\n\r\nYour \xC4\xD6\xE4\xF6, is neither characters
    with umlauts, nor characters with diaresis, nor the Nordic characters.\r\n\r\nI
    would suggest you study typefaces popular in languages where either diaeresis
    is used, or typefaces that is popular with German, Swedish and Finnish. Some typefaces
    succeed with using the same glyphs for both characters with the diacritic umlaut
    and the Nordic characters (the Nordic characters have evolved from blackletter
    ligatures, similar to how W an Y came into existence, the German diacritic umlaut
    came later as Germanophones was later with using Roman letters in writing and
    print).\r\n\r\nThe two glyphs that looks like an a or A with a ring above is used
    as a character in Swedish, Danish, Norweigian and Finnish, or as an A with a  diacritic
    in some African and Asian languages (but your font lack many other glyphs needed
    to support those languages). It is also used as a symbol for the SI-unit \xC5ngstr\xF6m
    (from a Swedish name).\r\n\r\n\xC5 is badly designed in almost all digital typefaces.
    The Ring and the character should give the impression of sharing the same blackness
    (it is ONE character, one unit, not a character with a ligature). The two parts
    should be close enough to look like one glyph, but not so close that the ring
    and the A look like they touch each other (it should not look like they where
    doing the hanky panky), this cause trouble because a digital font give different
    impressions when scaled to different sizes. Almost always is the ring either to
    large or to small, it is usually to thin, especially in bold fonts. The ring and
    the A should match each other the same way the dot and the stem in an lower case
    i do (all the Nordic characters (\xC5\xC4\xD6\xC6\xD8\xE5\xE4\xF6\xE6\xF8) should
    give this impression of being ONE character, one glyph, just like i). As there
    is lack of good digital type designs of \xC5 to study, it is best to look at either
    old lead type prints in Nordic languages, that use \xC5, or the handwriting of
    natives from the Nordic countries.\r\n\r\nIf you will use your font <strong>only
    with Nordic languages</strong>, then the space between the \"diacritics\" and
    the base character don't need to be at the same level in lower case or upper case,
    neither do they need to be at the same visual distance from the base characters
    in the two cases, but they absolutely <em>must be positioned the same in glyphs
    within each case</em> (like they where threaded on a straight line). If you will
    use the font with <strong>German</strong>, then the umlaut <em>must in both upper
    and lower case, either be positioned at the same visual distance from the base
    character or be at the same level above the base character</em>, either way, the
    same rule apply within the cases as with Nordic characters (germans also use \xDC,
    but not \xC5). Native German type designer can use other trickery, but you are
    obviously not a German, so don't.\r\n\r\nI don't know what rules apply if the
    glyphs will only be used in logos for US metal bands.\r\n\r\nAlso, your w looks
    heavy on the bottom (to much blackness there), and the blackness of \xC6 and \xD8
    is not the same as in the other glyphs.\r\n\r\nPS. As I read my post, I realised
    I sound was waay to negative, Your basic English characters already look better
    then in any font that have ever been shipped with MS Windows. I wouldn't even
    have bothered to comment on the bad parts if the font didn't look promising. Also
    Nordic \xC4\xD6\xE4\xF6 (but I'm uncertain if this is allowed for umlauts)can
    use dots that are not perfect squares or circles, I think your font would look
    really good with dots that are higher then they are wide, perhaps 2-5 times the
    height then the width (the Nordic dots are residues from a blackletter E rised
    above an blackletter A or O, you could say that  Nordic \xC4 and \xD6 is \"variations\"
    of \xC6 and \u0152, but with the E on top instead of at the side)."
