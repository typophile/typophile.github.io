  photos from my recent visit to Per\xFA. I was looking for a typeface that would
  match the region \"look and feel\" but I haven't found anything interesting. So
  I started sculpting something that would remind of Inca style or their stonework.
  What do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/peru_shaded_4006.jpg]\r\n\r\n________\r\n<a

    and the photoshop effects which somehow don't look very Inca to me. Right now
    it seems vaguely Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n  "

  body: "Yeah, I have to work on it to be clearly recognisable as \"Per\xFA\".\r\n\r\nSwastika
    sneaked in accidentally, true, however, I don't see a problem in the symbol present
    in different parts of the world for thousands of years. And I wouldn't be surprised
    if Incas had their own swastika as well... Actually, after quick googling:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"The
    origin of the swastika symbol is unknown. For thousands of years, it has been
    used as a symbol of the revolving sun, fire, infinity, or continuing re-creation,
    as well as a decorative motif in the Americas, China, Egypt, Greece, and Scandinavia.
    Swastikas have been found in the catacombs of Rome, on textiles of the Inca period
    (...)\"</cite>\r\n([[http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/ctg/swas.htm|source]])\r\n\r\n<cite>\"The
    presence of Swastika is evident in various civilisations such as the Egyptians,
    Mayans, Aztec, Inca, Native Americans, Romans, Greeks, Chinese, Japanese, ancient
    Troy and Celts to name but a few and that derived from the Vedic Dharma of Aryans
    of Bharat or India.\"</cite>\r\n([[http://www.ivarta.com/columns/OL_050314.htm|source]])\r\n\r\nAs
    for the photoshopping - as I mentioned before I wanted to get close to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Inka_mauern_cuzco.jpg|stonework]]
    effect but not sure if it works actually... The red colour is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Escudo_nacional_del_Per\xFA.svg|quite
    Peruvian]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tupa-inca-tunic.png|Incas
    didn't avoid it as well]].\r\n\r\n________\r\n<a href=http://www.lenart.pl>AL</a>

  body: "What I found remarkable about the Incas' stonework was that they didn't use
    any mortar, they fitted the stones so perfectly to each other that you can't even
    stick a piece of paper between the stones. Perhaps you can work with that idea?\r\n\r\nHere's
    the most famous example:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incan_architecture\r\n"

  body: "Pattyfab, I've seen this stone in Cusco. The logo above was inspired by the
    shapes of Inca stonework rather than the fact that there's no space between the
    stones (the lettering need to have some weight, I think).\r\n\r\nI don't know,
    after my experience in Peru, if I think about words that could describe that style
    I think: rough, ancient, geometric, colourful, simple...\r\n\r\n________\r\n<a

  body: "It's an improvement, but the forms still look rather frail. Perhaps you should
    try heavier strokes. You might even look at reversing it out so that it conveys
    a greater sense of volume.\r\n\r\nBtw the website you quote for the origins of
    the swastika looks like one of a number of sites affiliated to a certain right
    wing movement in India - perhaps not the most impeccable of sources when it comes
    to these things :)"

    the image in the Typophile RSS feed. I find it quite effective as a logo. If you
    were asking critique about a typeface you were drawing, then I would say it's
    not the best for readability. But as a logo, I find it imaginative and striking.\r\n\r\nMy
    2 cents, of course.\r\nr."
