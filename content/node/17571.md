  body: "I've used Verdigris</a> for various projects and never been disappointed.
    It's a wonderful workhorse serif. Neither too old or too modern, nor too eccentric
    or too boring, the right fit for almost any project. The only (small) drawback
    is its lack of bold and italic small caps.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/verdigris/pk_verdigris.htm\">Verdigris

  body: I'm not sure about Verdigris for poetry - it's designed for small sizes, and
    all the best poetry should be set fairly large to slow down reading. Small x-height,
    small counters and substantial interest and delicacy in the details are the things
    to look for. It's a pity Lutetia with the Porter-Garnett e isn't available, but
    you could try lengthening the extenders on Spectrum (a very quick job).

  body: I'm not sure why poetry needs to be set in large type. Help me understand.

  body: I don't get the large type and poetry thing either. The only thing I notice
    about poetry is designers tend to allow a lot of white space around the poem to
    create focus on the stanzas.

  body: The easiest way to help a reader slow down from the pace suited to most reading
    is to enlarge the type, because more fixations are needed to cover the greater
    area.
