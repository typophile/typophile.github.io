  is the time between [[saccade]]s where the eye remains relatively motionless. It
  is during a fixation that the eye processes the information being viewed through
  either a word based or shape based (often referred to as [[Bouma]] on Typophile)
  recognition process or part based letter recognition process. \r\n\r\nThis information
  is processed in the [[fovea]] of the eye."
