body: "As the title says...\r\nLet me explain what I mean: I need the elegance of
  a serif font that will be used for titling on very large formats. So I want to have
  some innovative elements, to add more personality.\r\nTake a look at the attached
  image. Is the Didot Elder by Optimo. I was tempted to use this one, just because
  the small \"g\" and some caps are very interesting, but some serifs are a litte
  \"diabolic\" (look at the \"s\" and \"z\").\r\nMaybe can you suggest me another
  serif typeface with cool personality?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/didotelder_5003.gif]"

  body: thank you, but too vert/horz contrasted for my purpose. is very similar to
    didot elder without the devilish elements. i'm ready to consider other style also.

    The reg. is nice and thin but the text version has a good heavy feel and no quirky
    details. Very short descenders. Maybe not enough personality for you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: <a href="http://typographica.org/000815.php">I feel exactly the same</a> as
    you do about Didot Elder. I knew the arrow serifs would prevent it from being
    widely used. Ambroise is really your best alternative.
