body: "Does anyone know a website where I can learn a bit about combining different
  fonts?\r\nFor example which serif goes with other sans serif. Or how to use script
  fonts properly. I am working on my wedding invitation these days, and I'm going
  for vintage navy style. Being client to yourself is a nightmare :/ This is something
  what I really like: http://ohsobeautifulpaper.com/tag/palm-papers/\r\nEven a book
  about this could help too. Thanks in advance if anyone can help."

  body: Oh wow so many information, thank you, I am starting my research today. Recently
    I discovered a beautiful font called Key http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/key/bold-lf/
    and want to use it but don't know how to combine it with other fonts. Great, thank
    you again
