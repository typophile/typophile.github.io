  body: "I'd definitely say keep going with this. \r\n\r\nLooks like you haven't decided
    on a variable-width or constant-width style. The <em>c</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>o</em>
    and the tails of the <em>g</em> and <em>e</em> are constant-width, and the rest
    are variable-width. I think the variable-width looks better. \r\n\r\nThe top of
    the vertical in <em>b</em>, <em>d</em> and <em>h</em>, and the bottoms of the
    <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> seem like they should be flatter. "
