body: "I have to find some text and signage type to go with an identity that uses
  Doyald Young\u2019s Finesse Light. It actually looks OK with the symbol that another
  designer sold to the client. (I have been given far worse.) But, what to use with
  this? Any ideas? I am stumped\u2026 The signature portion of the identity uses all
  caps, which helps and makes it look more classical. A bit like Trajan, before it
  was overused. Finesse Light is more similar to the heavier Berthold Christiana in
  design.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/doyald-young/young-finesse/light/"
