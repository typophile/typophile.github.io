body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone knows what font the Old Vic Theatre (in
  London, UK) use in all of their signage and communications. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldvic_6522.gif]\r\n\r\nMore
  examples can be seen at http://www.oldvictheatre.com\r\n\r\nI have tried to search
  to discover who designed the identity, and whether it's a custom typeface, but haven't
  had any luck! Any information would be great.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nVlad"

  body: Spacey Theatre - it is indeed custom and named after The Old Vic's artistic
    director, Kevin Spacey. More details in the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/4440">archives</a>
    and <a href="http://www.r-d-co.com/case/case_tov1.html">R&D&Co's website</a>.

      you so much. I'm confused, though, that searching for \"Old Vic\" kept giving
      me zero results. Is there a secret to finding things in the typophile archives?\r\n\r\nThanks
      again\r\nVlad"

  body: Same here but for the older stuff, I tend to use a google site search e.g.
    site:typophile.com "old vic" will return old threads.
