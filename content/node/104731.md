body: "Hi guys, can anyone identify this 20s style font? I've tried before but the
  thread got out of sight. ;-)\r\nI need it for a client that's waiting for my reply.
  I've browsed everywhere but can't find it. WhatTheFont can't identity it because
  it's too blurred.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could help me out here.\r\n\r\n\xAEene"

    helps sometimes. When the message gets bumped to the bottom nobody sees it anymore.
    ;-)\r\nI'll try to get some more background info on the usage, but I think the
    client also doesn't know much.\r\n\r\nStrange that nobody can recognize it. But
    hey, I also can't."

    manuals.\r\nYou could try to get some help from the experts at the Zuiderzeemuseum
    in Enkhuizen. There is a crafts-and-arts live exhibit there, if I recall correctly."
