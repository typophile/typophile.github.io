body: It's Garamond/Plantin-like but doesn't match the versions I have. Any ideas?
  All help greatly appreciated! (Expect to be kicking myself once it's ID-ed).

  body: "I haven't had any luck with this one either. I agree it looks very Garamond-ish,
    but the J has an odd serif on the hook that looks triangular. I have basically
    been searching for that J and haven't found it anywhere. I think it has the look
    of an independent (small foundry) Garamond version, although it's possible it
    is a heavier weight of something familiar, and doesn't show up in font searches
    because all weights aren't usually shown. I've been counting on that J design
    being common across the family weights, but that isn't always true.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Going by the vertical stress on the "o" and "g", I'd suggest it isn't a Garamond
    but perhaps a transitional face.

    any suggestions? I thought the 'a' and 'g' shapes looked like Garamond, but I
    didn't notice the stress.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I see the resemblance, but the width of the s and of the m/n counters is different
    there.
