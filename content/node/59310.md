  that is a recording of some music by a Spanish composer called Pablo de Sarasate.
  Does any one know of any fonts that are similar to any of the fonts used in this
  image? \r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions would be great, cheers!"

    and pick some that you think will work. I doubt if you will exactly match these,
    but you could be true to the feeling of the time period.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
