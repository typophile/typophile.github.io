  body: correct. But it makes it hard to design though because the fonts will look
    and balance completely differently and it ends up changing the way I design.

    InDesign both antialias type (and as far as I can tell, they appear to do it the
    same way), and anti-aliasing becomes less of an issue the more you zoom in (since
    it's only affecting the edges of the letters).\r\n\r\nCan you post screen shots
    of what you're talking about?"

    will look when printed. You need to print the page(s) using a good-quality printer
    to see more exactly how the fonts actually look when printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I've

    InDesign to lay out the pages, and if you needed to create vector artwork you'd
    make it using Illustrator and then import that graphic into your InDesign layout."

  body: This is not an anti-aliasing issue; it has to do with the way most programs
    render type vs. the way they render vector graphics. Generally, you can "soft-proof"
    the finished look of your type by converting it to outlines temporarily

  body: "Nick, if you're correct it still is an anti-aliasing issue. I'm fully prepared
    to believe that high-speed text rendering is done with another drawing engine
    different from the \"main\" drawing program -- but they both ought to be antialiased.\r\n\r\nSee
    Acrobat for a case in point; the type and 'lines' drawing engines yield very different
    results for a small font when rendered as text or as outlines.\r\n\r\nEven with
    different rendering engines, I stand by my point any screen rendering issue is
    primarily a <em>screen rendering issue</em>."

    another way to do this; however, thanks to CMD/CTRL+Z, the outlining can be easily
    undone, so changes aren't a problem. And, yes, Photoshop has different anti-alias
    settings because Photoshop <sttrong>rasterizes</strong> the type--the functional
    equivalent of converting the font to outlines in Illustrator, but with a great
    degree of user control over the finished output."

  body: "\u201C Photoshop has different anti-alias settings because Photoshop rasterizes
    the type--the functional equivalent of converting the font to outlines in Illustrator\u201D\r\n\r\nMy
    understanding of this is a bit different than yours, I think.\r\n\r\nPhotoshop
    has different (more) anti-alias settings because it chooses to do so. The underlying
    text rendering is the same between Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign: all three
    apps use Adobe\u2019s CoolType font engine. The other apps have the exact same
    anti-aliasing options available to them, and could expose them to end users if
    they wished.\r\n\r\nCoolType rasterizes the type in order to display it on screen.
    The type must be rasterized because the screen uses pixels, not vectors; ALL type
    you see on a computer screen must first be rasterized. To the best of my knowledge,
    Photoshop does not do anything that is the equivalent to converting the font to
    outlines in Illustrator, and in any case, that would yield different (and arguably
    worse) results, because of the loss of hinting information prior to rasterization.
    This is exactly why it is often a bad idea to convert text to outlines prior to
    making a PDF.\r\n\r\nThe difference in rendering of text converted to outlines
    results from two effects:\r\n\r\n1) Hinting information is lost. This results
    in more irregular and arguably simply worse rendering.\r\n\r\n2) A completely
    different set of code is used for rasterization, as the outlines are rendered
    as graphics rather than text. At small to medium sizes this results in bolder
    text. It can also result in some unfortunate side effects as for example in PDF
    Acrobat tries to beef up thin straight lines, which can affect letters such as
    el and eye in sans serif typefaces, making them heavier than the letters around
    them....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas,\r\n\r\nThanks for the background information; however, the original
    post raised the concern that, in Illustrator, fonts \"seem to look thinner than
    they really are, especially when you are zoomed out,\" which I suspect is due
    to smooth anti-aliasing being the default setting. The \"fix\" I proposed was
    simply for soft proofing: in my experience, converting the type to outlines <em>momentarily</em>
    gives them an appearance more in line with how they will appear in the final,
    printed piece (note the reference to UNDO).\r\n\r\nAlso, once Photoshop rasterizes
    type, I suspect that an engine different from Cool Type renders the image, eliminating
    the latter's softening/thinning effect.\r\n\r\n"

    font-based to graphics results in the text getting significantly heavier. The
    main reason is that font-based rendering only turns on a pixel if the center of
    the pixel is within the outline, while graphics rendering turns on the pixel if
    any part of it is touched by the outline.\r\n\r\n\u201CAlso, once Photoshop rasterizes
    type, I suspect that an engine different from Cool Type renders the image\u201D\r\n\r\nOf
    course, if the text has been permanently converted to pixels, then it later becomes
    a graphics engine displaying it... but the pattern of pixels is still one that
    was laid down by CoolType.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    body: "Further to my earlier comments, I had some email with the lead engineer
      responsible for the actual font rasterizer part of CoolType. We'll call him
      Dave, mostly because that's his name. (There used to be two such engineers,
      but the other insanely senior guy, Terry, got laid off a couple of years ago
      and now works for Google.)\r\n\r\nI asked: \u201CIs there one of the four anti-aliasing
      settings in Photoshop that will get text rendering that is the same as what
      InDesign and Illustrator users see? If so, which one?\u201D\r\n\r\nDave's reply
      below, with some comments interspersed from me....\r\n\r\n[Edited on Apr 8 based
      on further research/discussion.]\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There\u2019s not a simple
      answer. Each of our applications have historically done its own thing regarding
      anti-aliasing. (This is gradually improving.)\r\n\r\nI don't have InDesign installed
      to check, but I think I remember that it uses the same modes as Acrobat, including
      both Gray and Color DDR with linear blending.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDDR is short
      for \u201Cdevice-dependent rendering,\u201D and Color DDR is LCD-enhanced sub-pixel
      rendering, roughly equivalent to ClearType. You only see this last in two places:
      Acrobat, and InDesign\u2019s story editor. Both have Color DDR by default, but
      can turn it off. A pity it doesn\u2019t see broader use, because it is really
      quite fabulous IMO.\r\n\r\nWhen first introduced in Acrobat this Color DDR was
      called \u201CCoolType\u201D (misleading as heck, given that was the name of
      the entire library that did all forms of text rendering going back many years
      earlier), but now it is just labeled as the option to \u201Csmooth text\u201D
      \u201Cfor laptop/LCD screens\u201D in Acrobat prefs, or \u201CLCD optimized\u201D
      anti-aliasing in InDesign story editor prefs.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>At one point
      Illustrator was doing their own downsampling, but now it looks like they're
      using gray DDR with some kind of linear blending gamma (I don't know what value).\r\n\r\nPhotoshop
      \"Sharp\" mode is using Gray DDR. By default, there is no linear blending. But
      if you're willing to set a blending gamma for the entire document (not just
      the text layers), you can do so in the \"Color Settings\" dialog. Blend using
      a gamma of 1.22 should match Acrobat [in Gray DDR mode only, not Acrobat\u2019s
      default text rendering].</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAll this just goes to show how
      complicated all this is; the applications have a lot more virtual \u201Cknobs\u201D
      to twiddle compare to what is exposed to end users, and choices like the blending
      gamma affect what the user gets. Even though the same underlying text rendering
      engine is used across Adobe apps, with default settings you pretty much never
      get identical text rendering in normal use, because they have not coordinated
      their approaches.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
