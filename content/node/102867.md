body: "Dear Everyone,\r\n\r\nI exported a document for PDF print that contains several
  paths in which I used Type on a Path. There is no fill or stroke on the path, yet
  the PDF consistently shows a light pink background color around the path area (see
  attached image). I don't see anything wrong with the PDF settings, but I may not
  recognize the problem - suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you!!\r\nChava Drummond[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pdf_problem_path_background_4052.png]"

  body: "This looks like this is being caused by the drop shadow you have on the type.
    I believe the portion of the image that corresponds to the area bounding the type
    path is being rasterized in order to implement the [multiplied] raster shadow,
    and that is leading to slight color shift.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t say offhand the
    exact fix, but it will have to do with either color settings (make sure the image
    is the same color space as the Indd doc and the PDF output specs), or the drop
    shadow settings, or possibly with flattening settings. Something like that. If
    the type and image are not on the same layer, then perhaps combining them on one
    will help solve by getting the entire layer to rasterize as one."

    setting to save the PDF in a newer version (like if it's 1.4, change it to 1.5),
    and see if that makes any difference.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pdf_6455.png]\r\n\r\nOlder
    PDF versions are more compatible, which is good if someone views the PDF using
    old software, but newer versions are better at handling transparency and other
    things."

  body: "Interesting. I would actually suggest the opposite. Export as the lowest
    version of PDF you have available \u2014 probably 1.3 \u2014 and make sure to
    choose the high-resolution transparency flattener in the Advanced tab. This will
    \"flatten\" your drop shadow into an opaque object, which will guarantee it will
    print correctly, though your file will be larger."
