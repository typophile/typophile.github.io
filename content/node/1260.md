  body: 'Bienvenido Sergio, from one from Madrid... <BR>At first sight I like it but
    3 ideas: <BR>I think you should work with &#34;UA&#34;, even though I like them
    with &#34;UN&#34;, but this is the problem, I read UN &#40;la Universidad de Navarra...?&#41;
    <BR>25 ok in the same color, have you tried in the blue one? <BR>I like the text
    in gray but it is kind of hard to read for me, maybe becouse the gray is too light
    and the font thin, I don&#39;t know if this could be more legible in Upper case.
    <BR>Well, I hope it helps, y bienaventurados aquellos que pueden trabajar al lado
    del mar .... algun dia lo conseguire.'

  body: when the &#34;25&#34; is dark blue, it takes too much attention.  it&#39;s
    best in dark orange or dark gray. <BR> <BR>the best one might just be the bottom
    left one for me.  the colors are nice, and i can come closer to being able to
    read that thin font.  but i think that thin font should change..to something legible.  maybe
    it should be dark dark gray too. <BR> <BR>actually, i like the one to the right
    of that one, because the &#34;UA&#34; is orange and yellow, similar in color.  just
    make the text readable, and it&#39;ll be much better.

  body: Watching the logo of  the university...  why don&#39;t you take the first
    or second of the first row &#40;Red Yellow Gray&#41; and put it in an outline
    rectangle with blue lines, just a thought.

  body: For me the third on the top row is the most appealing.  It has a fresh appeal
    to me, celebratory and sunny <BR> <BR>But the text below it need be darker

  body: the type in the bottom &#40;Aniversari...&#41; is extremely hard to read,
    especially with such a light color
