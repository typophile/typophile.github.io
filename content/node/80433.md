  Hungarian\u2026 something like that.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "I\u2019ve found some problems with the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Finding
    sections of text that show every diacritical found in a large character set can
    be real pain, especially because some mark/letter/position-in-a-word combinations
    only seem to turn up in names of people and places. Many languages have a low
    ratio of marks to total text, requiring a lot of text to be proofed, so using
    the declaration eats up lots of time and paper and introduces lots of opportunities
    to miss over a problem after the fifteenth language out of thirty. It\u2019s a
    good source for testing actual text settings in a lot of different languages,
    but for general use I find something more stripped down works better."

  body: "You don't have to go beyond the first paragraph of the Preamble in Polish
    to get plenty of ogoneks and l-slashes, and get a feel for what the overall look
    of the language is.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration is prose, not isolated words. When
    you copy a text string from the Declaration and set it in bundled Adobe/Microsoft
    faces (which generally have full CE support), then you see how the language looks
    in different styles\u2014and this will give you an idea of how to execute the
    accented characters in your typeface. How much weight to give to the ogonek, for
    instance, and how low it should hang. "

  body: "The Preamble in Polish has probably a \"slight\" statistic overrepresentation
    of aogoneks due to the use of certain forms of style and grammar and word repetitions.\r\n\r\nPS:
    I would advise changing two or three instances of the word ZWA\u017BYWSZY to lowercase.
    Both forms contain important letter pairs. \r\n"

    job vex'd cwm finks.\"\r\n\r\nWhich, it says, is an abbreviation for:\r\n\"The
    act of carving symbols into quartz irritated ruffians from a Welsh river valley.\"\r\n\r\nUnless,
    of course, \"fink\" is synonymous with ruffian in Welsh.\r\nIn early and mid twentieth
    century American English slang, fink meant a snitch, a tattle-tale - in gangster
    parlance, a \"rat\". And now ruffian, too?\r\n\r\nA fine and noble surname, smeared!\r\n"
