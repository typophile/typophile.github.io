body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe currently have on hand both the new Fontographer and FontLab
  4.6. My tech team needs me to provide a business justification before upgrading
  FontLab up to 5. Can those who have the upgrade tell me what the improvements are
  and why I might need them?\r\n\r\nOur team is currently using font manipulation
  programs to alter existing fonts or to create fonts from existing artwork. We are
  not creating fonts from scratch. If the changes between 4.6 and 5 are geared more
  to those who create fonts from scratch, I probably don't need the upgrade.\r\n\r\nYour
  advice is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKristin"

  body: "We do have a changelog from 5.0.0 to 5.0.2: \r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/The-News/Announcements/FontLab-Studio-5.0.2/\r\n\r\nA
    \"changelog\" from 4.6 to 5.0 would be 250 pages long since version 5.0 includes
    two years of intense development. The highlights of 5.0 compared to 4.6 are listed
    in the preface to the manual that you can download from our website (http://www.font.to/downloads/manuals/FLS5MacManual.zip).
    The highlights are also summarized in my introductory article (http://www.font.to/downloads/documents/FLS5MagTypo14.pdf
    ). \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio 5 definitely offers improvements for people who do font
    modifications. FontLab Studio 5 is the first version of our font editor that can
    handle OpenType Layout features in an non-destructive manner (i.e. you can change
    some glyphs or names without touching the compiled OT tables), the handling of
    composites has been much improved, many bugs and problems have been fixed in handling
    of OpenType fonts, support for non-BMP characters of Unicode 3.2 was added, new
    aspects of the OpenType font format specifications have been incorporated, autohinting
    has been improved. The new automatic classes generation tool allows the user to
    take existing plain kerning and fully automatically convert it into class-based
    OpenType kerning. That's just for a start :) \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab
    Ltd.\r\n"

  body: Thanks Adam. A full version number changelog needn't be comprehensive. Just
    a simple list of improvements from 4.6 to 5.0 posted directly on the site would
    help 4.6 users make the jump.

    a week, it is almost certainly worth upgrading.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas is right. Since 5.02, my crashes have been vaporized.  Stable is a
    really good thing.  Also, if you figure your hourly rate, you can compute time
    savings from the new features.  Opentype is way easier in version 5. I would say
    it pays for itself in 3 weeks. The upgrade is a nobrainer.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
