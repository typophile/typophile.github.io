body: "I am having an issue with a font in development, and it is this: The vertical
  stems are too irregular in width/colour/weight when they are rendered in webbrowsers
  like Safari or Firefox in OS X. Firefox is marginally better than Safari. A PDF
  has the same issue, but to a lesser degree. All the stems in question are of exactly
  the same width. Other fonts like Ariel or other webfonts do not show this issue.
  I tried both CFF/OTF and TTF, but they both have the same issue. This leads me to
  think there is some hinting setting I have borked, but OS X does not use hinting,
  so huh? What can be wrong? I'm working with a UPM of 2048, but I seem to remember
  making a test in 1000, and that had the same issue.\r\n\r\nI'll be grateful for
  any pointers, hints, puns."

  body: "Just a quick guess; could be that different stem values are assigned (by
    mistake if you auto hinted the font) to stems that should have the same width.
    And on top of that perhaps the ppm size change are different, so the rasterizer
    thinks that *this* stem should be thicker at *that* size and a similar stem should
    be thicker at another size. I could take a look if I had the VFB of course, now
    it\u2019s just a guess.\r\n\r\nI know people say OSX doesn't read hints but I
    see a lot of differences when hinting TrueType fonts even on Mac\u2019s. Acrobat
    uses Adobes rasterizer I think..."

  body: "I've opened a bat-channel to Apple and they confirmed that it was a bug.
    It's both in OS X and in iOS, and can occur with all fonts. Take a look at this
    screenshot from an iPad. The font is Georgia, and I've put some red pixels under
    glyphs to indicate the issue.\r\n\r\n[[http://i.imgur.com/mPIIh.png]]"

  body: "This issue is as old as OSX, we've discussed it here at great length, and
    I'm surprised someone called it a \"bug\". \r\n\r\nEven if your stems are identical,
    without x hints they will not remain so when rasterized on the Mac or Windows.
    In addition, the Mac is using sub-pixel positioning; each glyph may be positioned
    at one of three possible sub-pixel locations, giving each letter three possible
    renderings.\r\n\r\nIn your example, if you look closely, there are three different
    l.c. \"n\" renderings in the very first line. \r\n\r\n"

    (stems), the various left_gray + center_black + right_gray totals\r\nneed to fall
    within a tight range so as not to jump out as too light/dark.\r\nAnd \"unplanned\"
    gamma deviation is the first thing to throw that off.\r\nAlso, the narrower the
    center_black the more obvious it gets.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a friend with a virus-infested Mac took\r\nher system to an Apple store and managed
    to convince\r\nthem to fix her persona-non-grata machine*, but to the\r\nvery
    end they used the term \"unwanted software\". I have\r\nto think they get fired
    in 5 seconds for saying \"virus\".\r\nTo be fair many companies seem to do this:
    I remember\r\nin the 90s I called Adobe to report a bug (it was not\r\nincluding
    the correct Black and White in Indexed Color\r\nand Macromedia Director refused
    to import the images);\r\nthe woman actually congratulated me for finding a feature,\r\nand
    when I pestered her she wouldn't budge. Next release,\r\n\"feature\" is gone...
    I should have called and complained\r\nwhy they removed my favorite feature! The
    problem is, it's\r\nbest if non-employees don't engage in this sort of thing...\r\n\r\n*
    It took two trips. The first time they told her:\r\n\"Somebody hacked your email
    account. Go away.\"\r\n\r\nI don't care who calls it a bug, a feature, or a moot\r\npoint;
    it looks like somebody left dog puke in a ziploc\r\nunder the sun for a week.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n1)
    The stems are identical in width. Requiring them\r\nto have x-direction hints
    sounds like one of those\r\ngovernment forms where you have to enter your\r\nfull
    name in three places, on page 1.\r\n\r\n2) It sounds like Claus has hints anyway.\r\n\r\n3)
    Georgia looks fine in Windows.\r\n\r\n4) What's this about using subpixel positioning
    without\r\nsubpixel rendering? And if you're using subpixel positioning\r\nof
    any kind, you better get your shades of gray/color adding\r\nup to even perceptions.
    Maybe it's a gamma issue?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDoes an allegedly typographically-savvy
    tech company\r\nreally let something like this sit around for two years?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
