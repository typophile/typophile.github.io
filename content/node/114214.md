  body: "OK, so we exclude fonts designed after the 1970s. The G does not fit Rockwell
    or Stymie, but does fit Adrian Frutiger's Serifa [1966] http://www.myfonts.com/search/serifa/fonts/\r\nand
    his Glypha [1977] http://www.myfonts.com/search/glypha/fonts/\r\nScale is small
    so some guessing.\r\nAs for width, this was the era of photo lettering when shrinking
    and expanding of fonts for LP covers, books etc. was common.\r\nThen again, this
    might be something else?\r\nDon\r\n"

    close match. The request was for an ID for the font actually used for the LP label.

  body: "Hi Danny, as for private e-mail, I prefer to share my info with all readers
    of this forum. \r\nIn terms of reproducing the letter forms and width in a clean
    text, i.e. not a distressed, worn or aged typewriter style, I like ITC American
    Typewriter Cond or Cond Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-american-typewriter/cond/
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-american-typewriter/cond-bold/ If you can
    use a font editor to blend the two fonts 50-50 you should end up with a demi-bold
    weight that is really close to your sample.  Joel Kaden and Tony Stan created
    this  proportionally spaced typeface in 1974, four years after release of Tell
    the Truth. BTW, for the best Otis song  \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" you
    need another LP. Another candidate with almost the right weight, but not quite
    as close in letter forms and too wide, is Italian Typewriter Bold  by Leonardo
    Di Lena for Flanker http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flanker/italian-typewriter/bold/\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Back in the 70s we did most heads with phototype and you had all sorts of
    control on weight and slant etc. using optical means meant some of it was not
    a "given weight" but something one off for the job.
