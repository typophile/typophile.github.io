  that I'm hoping will give you a quick fantasy break:\r\n\r\nFirst, who's your dream
  employer? Assuming, of course, the job would be at least LOOSELY based in typography
  -- although I'm sure doing work for Rob Halford would, indeed, be pretty f-ing sweet.
  Oh and kudos if the answer is \"myself.\"\r\n\r\nSecond -- and I'm <em>really</em>
  excited to hear what you have to say on this one -- if you could have any typeface
  made (or , if you prefer, you could have infinite time to draw and dote over one
  yourself) -- what would it be?\r\n\r\ndeeeeeeeeeeeep"

    typeface: Will have to wait until the technology catches up but (after research
    by specialists outside the typefield: Neurologists, psychology etc.) a typeface
    that would make it easier for dyslexics to read (One that is adjusted individually
    to the needs of the specific person - adjusted by a new preference possibility
    in Open type 4.0 or something down that track;-)"

    to organize them, so I could find the perfect font for what I am doing at all

    and would provide a credit card for that purpose. \r\n\r\nWanting me to be relaxed

  body: My dream employer is the Vatican, but the job has nothing to do with typography.
    In the dream, I am the Holy See's official consultant to the makers of horror
    films, charged with ensuring that their plots are theologically consistent. The
    only trouble with the dream is that I don't actually like horror films, but of
    those I have seen only a very few have presented a consistent, thorough theological
    worldview, the absence of which undermines scariness by making me giggle.

    to the basic question though. The following is from the movie \"Office Space\"
    and will maybe offer a brief comedic break...\r\n\r\nPeter: Our high school guidance
    counselor used to ask us what you'd do if you had a million dollars and you didn't
    have to work. And invariably what you'd say was supposed to be your career. So,
    if you wanted to fix old cars then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.\r\n\r\nSamir:
    So what did you say?\r\n\r\nPeter: I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm
    working at Initech.\r\n\r\nMichael: No, you're working at Initech because that
    question is bull\"stuff\" to begin with. If everyone listened to her, there'd
    be no janitors, because no one would clean \"stuff\" up if they had a million
    dollars.\r\n\r\n[Later]\r\nPeter: What would you do if you had a million dollars?\r\n\r\nLawrence:
    I'll tell you what I'd do, man: two chicks at the same time, man.\r\n\r\nPeter:
    That's it? If you had a million dollars, you'd do two chicks at the same time?\r\n\r\nLawrence:
    Damn straight. I always wanted to do that, man. And I think if I were a millionaire
    I could hook that up, too; 'cause chicks dig dudes with money.\r\n\r\nPeter Gibbons:
    Well, not all chicks.\r\n\r\nLawrence: Well, the type of chicks that'd double
    up on a dude like me do.\r\n\r\nPeter: Good point.\r\n\r\nLawrence: Well, what
    about you now? what would you do?\r\n\r\nPeter: Besides two chicks at the same
    time?\r\n\r\nLawrence: Well, yeah.\r\n\r\nPeter: Nothing.\r\n\r\nLawrence: Nothing,
    huh?\r\n\r\nPeter: I would relax... I would sit on my ass all day... I would do
    nothing.\r\n\r\nLawrence: Well, you don't need a million dollars to do nothing,
    man. Take a look at my cousin: he's broke, don't do \"stuff.\""

    very much a back-burner project because I lack the skills to pull it off; I think
    it will end up being a 16-year project like Beorcana. I also wanted to do a simpler

    made that my senior thesis."
