    the first time one of us jumped the gun and only bothered to read the actual request
    afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlpha Headline, innit? I almost posted that as well. ;^)\r\n\r\nThe
    first thing I went looking for was [[Ren\xE9 Verkaart]]'s <a href=\"http://www.characters.nl/\">Nordic</a>.
    Quite different though."

  body: Alpha Headline indeed.. but the designer's website says it's exclusive to
    Mitsubishi? Or maybe these Cargo people got ahold of it before Mitsubishi exclusified
    it?
