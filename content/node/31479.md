body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nAnyone have some good examples or ideas of Briem Akademi
  paired with another font (text or display). I'm having a hard time getting some
  ideas going as it's a pretty unique font. I would really like to see some examples
  of this font in use if anyone knows of any.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\n***
  UPDATED ***\r\n</strong>\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/random/barnDance/\r\n\r\nI
  finally got my photos loaded into my computer, although you can't see much of the
  typography in these, I think you'll get the general theme I'm going for. I'll get
  some better photos as soon as I can get to my project. For now you can see the Briem
  Akademi used on the Front Cover (\"Barn Dance\") - it's altered to fit into that
  diamond shape. Univers is used on the Inside for the event information.\r\n\r\nThis
  project is based off a sophomore year assignment (family reunion invitation), and
  I've been working on it this semester (and last) for my senior portfolio. The \"invitation\"
  is basically a reminder and/or commemorative piece for all family members who will
  be attending our families annual barn dance :)\r\n\r\nI would love to hear any comments
  on the type, design, etc... I would call it 90% done at this point, so hopefully
  I can wrap this project up soon. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nMike"

    pretty tight (-25).\r\n\r\nI need a font I can use as body copy and smaller sub
    headings.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n"

  body: "Well I ended up using Univers - any suggestions on that? I really liked the
    condensed versions, they have a very tall x-height as well and it looks very clean
    next to the Briem Akademi.\r\n\r\nI'll get an image up of the printed piece either
    today or tomorrow (depending on when they unlock the building it's currently in
    :) )"
