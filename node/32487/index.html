I'm not sure I understand your comment. CS 3 may include some fixes too complex to include in a CS 2 update. However, it will also contain new features, and hence new bugs. Some designers are only recently switching to CS 2. InDesign 4.0.4 is going to be as good as it gets for a while....</div>

I would be surprised if the announcement date is the release date. Based on past announcements, it would be 6 to 8 weeks to ship date. But things are different this time. There never was a pre-announcement 1 year early, as Chizen did last year, and there was never a public beta before.

I suspect we will see a glyphs palette like ID has in Photoshop (or is that already in CS2 ... I skipped that one).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Anybody know what will be included in CS3? We all know the dramatic changes in Photoshop; what about Illustator and InDesign? Is Imageready being replace by Fireworks? What about Flash and Dreamweaver? 

I'm guessing there's going to be several different bundles. The Web Bundle, The Desktop Bundle, The Professional Bundle and the Educational Bundle, plus maybe even a Beginner's/Family Bundle.

It seems like only yesterday CS2 was being debuted.

I don't use flash, my partner does all our flash work.  I wish I could get Dreamweaver in the Design Standard package.  Maybe next upgrade it won't be so expensive.  I just hope for not too many bugs.

Adobe was smart to put out CS3 early.  I'm hooked.  No way would I go back to an earlier version.

		<div class="commentbody">I watched part of today's webcast. The new apps look very interesting and seem like worthy upgrades. There was almost no mention of new type features (if there are any), but some seem to be implied. 

For example, Flash can now import Photoshop and Illustrator files directly, and one of the options is to keep imported text editable. This seems to imply that Flash will now support OpenType. If not, then I'm not sure how this could work. The question is, if this is true, what is the extent that Flash users will have to OT features, etc.?

Also, I noticed on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/features/allfeatures/">feature list</a> for Illustrator CS3 a bullet point that says "Advanced typography." It has a little plus sign disclosure box, which usually means more information hidden below, but it doesn't do anything if you click on it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">According to MacWorld.com:

Adobe Creative Suite 3 Design Premium and Standard and Adobe Creative Suite 3 Web Premium and Standard will begin shipping in April 2007. Adobe Creative Suite 3 Production Premium and Adobe Creative Suite 3 Master Collection will begin shipping worldwide in the third quarter of 2007.

Creative Suite 3 Design Premium will cost $1799, Adobe Creative Suite 3 Web Premium will be $1599, Creative Suite 3 Production Premium is $1699 and the Adobe Creative Suite 3 Master Collection will cost $2499. There are also numerous upgrade paths available for Adobe customers.

My question: why the heck does Adobe seperate "Production" from "Design?" I can see (a little) where Web Designers wouldn't want to mess with a lot of pre-press stuff, but C'MON ALREADY -- Most of the world still needs ink on paper, and that means designers who know production!

Considering that A) the "art" of production (those professionals whose one-and-only job is pre-press) has continually dissolved over the years as more and more of the "production" burden is rolled into the designers' work ("just send me the file..." -- who cares if it's not color-corrected/separated/etc.), and B) Adobe spends so much of their press time hyping the concept of multi-purposing documents ("...your InDesign print job transfers seamlessly into Dreamweaver and displays on a Nokia phone!"), WHY OH WHY does Adobe kepp "crippling" their mainstream (read: affordable) bundles by leaving out real production tools?

		<div class="commentbody">Also, in the "Design" and "Web" areas, you can get the basic Photoshop/InDesign/Illustrator bundle or the Dreamweaver/Flash/Fireworks bundle for $1999 and $999 respectively. The three "Premium" bundles take, say the basic "Design" bundle and add a couple of "Web" apps (but not all the "Web" apps). The thing that seems to be missing in this line up is a basic "Production" bundle (After Effects/Premier/Soundbooth/Encore) without either "Web" or "Design" apps.</div>
