body: "Hello I was happy to see a Christmas card where the letters were made by Japanese
  school children out of folded origami paper. \r\nA photo of the card (heavily photoshopped)
  was the basis for my own Christmas card.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VladimirXmas2009_5666.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
  are online instructions on how to construct such letters, although the card I saw
  followed other patterns. Origami paper is square, colored on one side and usually
  white on the other. Have fun!\r\n http://www.origami-club.com/en/abc/index.html\r\n"
