  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Gah, I've never done this before and debated promoting the typeface here at all, but since you all give me inspiration and happiness with your new releases, it would be selfish of me not to share with you all. So sheepishly, here it is.

The other day I release Ne10, a new stencil typeface I designed, through YWFT. This stencil font takes its inspiration from a neon sign at my local pizzeria without being blatant in its reference. I found myself staring at the sign too often, so I decided to try to work it out digitally. While sketching it up I realized that this could work rather nicely as a stencil font, instead of a faux 3D neon looking thing. So although the inspiration is neon, the result is more modern looking. Hopefully some of you will like it. 

I don't understand the linking system here, so here is the link — http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0668

Also, make your image no more than 588 pixels wide, to avoid the scroll bar.

A nice play of neon, stencil, template and rounded influences.

Strangely (or perhaps not), while there are many types inspired by neon signs, AFAIK there are none which accurately translate such lettering.</div>

I tried to understand it, but it doesn't conform to any of the standards that I know. *sheepishly* And I was being a little lazy. 
I did edit the image to fix the scroll bar issue, thank you.

I think the problem with rendering it realistically is that you get stumped by either the physical 3D quality of the tubes, or you get it when you realize part of what makes it look correct is that it emits light. Well, probably it's both of those things. Which is pretty difficult to realize fully given the limitations of what a typeface is (or at least what a typeface is right now, maybe in a future iteration).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By "accurate" I mean that the font letters correspond to functional neon lettering, i.e. without strict geometricality and impossible overlaps and sharp corners, and with appropriate lengths of "tube" (not too stencilly).

It wouldn't necessarily make for a good typeface, I'm just observing that there is nothing that "real" in the way of fonts.</div>

Although  [[http://www.vllg.com/TypeSupply/Ohm#panel=poster|Ohm]] by Tal Lemming wasn’t meant to thruthfully replicate neon lettering, it got used as a neon sign eventually.
