		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure how you define "fame"; commercial success is one option, but the data is difficult to get to, and you should allow a few years for sales momentum to build. Another option is peer recognition; competitions, awards, and the like. So, with apologies for any I may have forgotten, the TDC has awarded: 
Nassim by Titus Nemeth, 
Tisa by Mitja Miclavcic, 
Calouste by Miguel Sousa, 
Maiola  by Veronika Burian, 
Noam by Adi Stern, 
Gentium by Victor Gaultney, and
Rayuela by Alejandro lo Celso. 

The Creative Review also awarded student projects: Veronika's Maiola and Malou Verlomme's Ficus. 

Not strictly an answer to your question, but laudable nevertheless is the work of Tim Ahrens, which has garnered considerable recognition while Tim is a part-time student. 

And, attempting foresight, I am sure that David Cabianca's Cardea will turn many heads when it is eventually released.

FF Strada - Albert Pinggera, while at the KABK / Royal Academy of Art, The Hague

<cite>talks about Jan Tschichold working out Sabon Italic [...] when they were students</cite>

Do you know to which drawings the book refers? <cite>Leben und Werk des Typographen J.T.</cite> shows a sheet with an italic alphabet, dated 1918 (he was 16 then), but it would seem a bit farfetched to consider it as an early Sabon. The footnote says: "Schriftstudie, vermutlich nach Granjons Kursiv" / "a type study, presumably following Granjon's Italic".
However, when 18, Tschichold was an excellent calligrapher -- impossible <cite>not</cite> to be jealous!
When looking into the small catalog, I wish I could have visited the Tschichold-exhibition at the Kunstgewerbemuseum Zurich in 1976. But I doubt the new-born that I was then would have understood what it was about ...</div>

Loxley doesn't offer a citation, but it sounds like the passage is referring to that drawing. 
<cite>Type...</cite> could definitely do with a few more illustrations, since it sounds somewhat like he is making the claim that the italic <cite>is</cite> an early Sabon Italic, as opposed to an unrelated precursor.

		<div class="commentbody">"Can someone tell me the name some famous typefaces were released/designed when the designer was a student."

Someone's already asked how famous, and I'm wondering at the definition of student*, but both these fellows were enrolled at RISD when they designed these faces and probably more for the last named:
FF Providence, Guy Jeff Nelson
FF Dolores, Tobias Frere-Jones

A little math indicates that one (*besides Knuth), must've been born after 1960, (or perhaps before 1640), and, before about 1980, to up-to-now have designed a font that became famous while they were in school. This may be further limited, as the glut of new designs made even the best school projects drown in the many-to-be-marketed by around 2000, (2000 - 22yrs.old - 2 yrs. marketing to make famous font = 1976 birth). bringing the range of possible fame in fonts in school to but 16 possible graduating classes. On the other side, one could not study with a public type design product until 1987 at the earliest, (- 22yrs.old - 2 yrs. marketing = 1963 birth) bringing the possible years down to 13 for anyone who adopted Fontographer as early as 1987...

...so I'd be interested in how many you find.

Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Josh Darden designed a bunch of typefaces while in high school. I think his first one was at age 14 or 15, like Christian. He partnered with his pal Tim Glaser on many of the early typefaces. His earlier faces were GarageFonts releases like Diva, OUT, and Locus, and Index and Profundus a bit later.

I was working at GF circa 1999-2000 when <em>Time</em> magazine chose Index to appear on the front cover of one of their special issues. That was a huge deal, as they rarely deviated from their standard typography.

The question was famous <cite>typefaces</cite>, not now-famous designers.
Which however wouldn't stop me from stating that I started at 13.  :-)
