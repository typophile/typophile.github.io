  seem to find the typeface for the word \"Caltrans\" in the logo itself. Can anyone
  help me or is this just a custom script made specifically for the logo. I seem to
  recall that there is a community outreach program in the Tenderloin in SF (can't
  remember the actualy name) but they have a logo that riffs off the Caltrans logo
  and they have the same script. Please help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/caltrains_typeface_5216.jpg]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  It's CityTeam Ministries! http://www.cityteam.org/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't think there is much resemblance between the two logos, except that
    they are both techno styles. Caltrans probably had theirs designed for them, the
    other outreach group probably used a freeware font for theirs. See the Techno
    categories at Dafont.com for possible styles that may be close enough to the Caltrans
    look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
