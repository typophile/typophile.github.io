body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out how to manage this in InDesign (CS4).\r\n\r\nI
  am currently setting a book. I want the book to have a running heading of the current
  chapter name. However, I do not want a heading to appear when the Chapter Name style
  is the first occurrence on the page.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can see this screenshot:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202012-05-25%20at%205.21.54%20PM.png
  (no idea how to make the img tag work)\r\n\r\nThe heading looks cramped when the
  Chapter Name style appears at the top of the page.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any advice
  on how I can achieve this?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    and apply where necessary.\r\n2. (the Bad way) Shift+Ctrl (or Cmd)+click on the
    running header and delete it.\r\n3. (the Ugly way) Add a thick white Rule Above
    to your Chapter Name paragraph style, thick enough and high enough to hide the
    running header."

    That way any style changes you make to your original master (adjusting the margin,
    moving the page numbers, or whatever) will automatically be reflected in the master
    used for the chapter titles.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/master_5485.jpg]"

  body: I would go with Theunis's ugly way! It's the least work, will print fine,
    and the "deletion" of the running head will move with the chapter title. This
    is actually what I was about to suggest, but I arrived too late.

  body: Thanks everyone for your advice - the "ugly" way seems cheating, but at the
    end of the day it can be reversed easily and the result is the same!

    it looked fine on screen it caused problems at the print shop. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    it was the printer's fault, it seems like the technique should work. But unusual
    workarounds can sometimes cause unexpected problems, so you might want to do a
    test.\r\n"

    There is little difficult in creating the files and it takes full advantage of

    where the text boxes on a spread were set up to allow for a larger inner margin
    - and inserting a new page threw out this margin as the page updated correctly
    but the text boxes somehow detached from the master"

    Users will see that obstructed heading flash for an instant before it is covered

    you can control the behavior of overflow text. Check the In-Program Help."

  body: Well the so-called "bad" method (manually deleting the header on those pages)
    isn't an elegant solution, but it's simple and will work fine. And if you need
    to change a title page back to a regular one later, just select "remove all local
    overrides" from the Pages palette fly-out menu and the deleted text box will reappear.

    it's the method as recommended by Adobe, \"Bad\" because manual overrides should
    be avoided whenever possible (I'm also neurotic about using proper paragraph and
    character styles for <em>everything</em>), and \"Ugly\" because ... well, it is!\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    rather than yet even more e-pub solutions you can only use with last years' products,
    I would like to have seen paragraph style-based Master Pages (or individual Master

  body: "Thanks for your comments - I will take them all into consideration. I am
    preparing to set a new section (I imagine some time later today) and will experiment
    with the Masters-approach.\r\n\r\nI will try to explain better the point I raised
    in my previous post.\r\n\r\nImagine I have a master spread of two pages. The master
    text boxes within these masters are set to allow for a greater inside margin than
    outside margin to allow for the curve of the page when the book is read. I then
    set the text. After the text is set, I find I need to place a new page (for instance,
    of photos or diagrams) half way through the document. I insert the page, and find
    that all of the text frames <em>after</em> this point are reversed in their layout,
    in that they have a greater outside margin than inside margin. InDesign correctly
    applies the master (I can see that the margins are still set up correctly), but
    for some reason the text boxes have delinked from the master and now need to be
    manually repositioned.\r\n\r\nDoes this have a simple workaround? Again, this
    is due to my inexperience with InDesign, so I suspect the answer is simple!"

    of pages added or deleted will make this happen.\r\n\r\nBut you can just delete
    the text frame on the page where you want to add an image \u2014 and then the
    text will just start reflowing from the page after that, and not change the layout."

    the text frame (with appropriate Text Wrap settings).\r\nDoing this would keep
    the text reflowing without the need to recreate the text frame in case you need
    to move the image to a different page."
