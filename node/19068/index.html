  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have recently seen several references to grids involved with t-shirts and magazines layout. I know there is an option for grids in Photoshop, but never really heard how they are used. I have always composed by eyeballing it (and this may be obvious to grid afficianados).</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a resource that would explaing the basic use of grids in design?</p>
<p>And when composing inside an image where the image dictates where some things have to go, are grids still useful?

<p>Photoshop is not a &ldquo;design&rdquo; software per se - it&rsquo;s used for images and image manipulation. For design, especially something like a magazine, you should be using Quark or Indesign, not photoshop.</p>
<p>You should also familiarize yourself with guides so you don&rsquo;t have to be eyeballing anything. This applies to p-shop and Illustrator as well as Quark and Indy.</p>

<p>How do you test your fonts without real software :(</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With some fonts, you don&rsquo;t have to do much to find out they are screwed up. Sometimes I consider it a challenge to make it display nicely (faking real quotes, or maybe kerning a little bit). But if it is too bad, it gets the boot. There are plenty more where they came from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are serious about working with fonts you really need to work with design software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe someday. I suppose it would be nice if I got good enough that foundries would start sending me some of their fonts to play with and feature on my site. A three relatively small ones already do, although I was a customer first. Someday I will probably start a commercial section, so I can play with more fonts that have fewer surprises.</p>
<p>Right now I have almost 20,000 IP addresses making over 4,500,000 hits a month, mostly for the free photos. At some point I am hoping I have enough traffic that someone that sells fonts and images, will also let me feature their images for a link to their site. I see some pretty cool photos in some of the magazines that somehow find their way to me in the mail. (I think Adobe may give away addresses).</p>

<dt>Anyway, I&rsquo;m an old dog, but I can still learn a new trick if I&rsquo;m dragged kicking and screaming.</dt>
