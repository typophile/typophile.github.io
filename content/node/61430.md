  alumni. Because of budget and the lack of visuals, I will be relying on mainly on
  typography. It would be great if I could pick the brains of the more experienced
  designers here.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering if there is any rules of thumb for determining
  type size when reading from a wall (or is it just a matter of testing it out?).
  In particular, how would one size lengthier blocks of text, such as the introduction.
  What other considerations should I keep in mind when designing in this context?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nE."

    it maybe depending on the space of the gallery, if the space is too small, then
    you won't have much space for bigger text, also depends on what kind of work that
    you will display."

    taping them together to test. But it's really hard visualize it as a whole.\r\n\r\nAny
    help would be appreciated."

  body: There is no substitute for testing. Besides type size, letterspacing is crucial.
    But if you are looking for a rule of thumb, I suppose 1 inch cap height for every
    50 feet of viewing distance is an old sign standard that may still be valid.

  body: "The AIA's Architectural Graphic Standards has some information on this. It's
    a relatively expensive book, but well worth it for much more than just that tidbit
    of info. There are some other books dealing specifically with exhibit graphics,
    but I'm not sure of the titles. The problem with the AIA book is that it deals
    strictly with size and not type selection and spacing. As mentioned above testing
    is the best way to go.\r\n\r\nMy key bit of advice, based on seeing this mistake
    many times, is to use a scale figure on any elevation drawings you make. Most
    designers are more experienced with print and page design. They tend to forget
    that a wall is not the same as a page and I've seen many exhibit graphics with
    text placed at the viewer's waist or even knees."
