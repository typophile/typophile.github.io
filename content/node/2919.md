    too much going on until all hours not to stay at the main party ... err I mean
    conference ... hotel. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    You only have to walk drunk and not drive drunk - the &#34;Law of Averages&#34;
    becomes much easier to handle. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ve stayed at a Nikko once &#40;Bangkok&#41;,
    and it was pretty classy, but very reasonably priced. But you don&#39;t want to
    know what &#34;niko&#34; means in Arabic. <BR> <BR>&#62; no rock garden can be
    seen <BR> <BR>You just reminded me of something funny that happened to me during
    the ATypI-Rome conference: the hotel I had found &#40;on the web&#41; said it
    had a roof-top pool, and I even remember seeing a photo of it. When I got there,
    the first thing I saw behind the check-in desk was an overly-prominent photo of
    the roof... with a huge flat area where the pool was supposed to be! I asked the
    guy &#34;What happened to the pool?&#34;, and he says &#34;We never have the pool.&#34;
    Very suspicious, I say. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>Is that a rock garden behind that sliding door? <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s just
    a rock-patterned carpet...
