  the finishing touches to my invitations. I'm tring to find a modern script typeface
  (such as Ministry Script) that can handle the name 'Lizzie' (my wife-to-be's name).
  As you can imagine the double z is proving to be a bit of a problem.\r\n\r\nI did
  have my heart set on Ministry Script but would welcome any suggestions."

  body: "Ministry Script is very nice indeed, and it has four variants for the letter
    \"z\". Another nice font from <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/home\">Sudtipos</a>
    has this \"zz\" ligature:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zz_5058.gif]\r\nThe
    font's name is <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000181\">Affair</a>;
    a tricky word indeed."

  body: 'if you feel brave enough, go ahead and tweak the type a bit. type (especially
    lettering-inspired type) is meant to function as a starting point. when i used
    Ministry for <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/14359">my sister''s invite</a>,
    i actually lightned the names a bit (as they are quite a bit larger than the regular
    text). '

    It has a few variations for z.

    z's.
