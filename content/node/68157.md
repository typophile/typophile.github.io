body: "I'm putting together some secondary logo fields for a healthcare system's new
  identity and having major problems with the \"rv\" and \"ry\" pairings. I've searched
  the interwebs and haven't found any standard ligatures for these. I've had to keep
  the kerning pretty tight because some of the names get pretty long (ie: Physical
  Rehabilitation), but I don't think it's too tight.\r\n\r\nThe font is DIN Next Regular,
  and I've gone ahead and created my own ligatures. I'm not a type designer so I thought
  I'd post what I've got and see if anyone has ever had this problem themselves and
  to get any general feedback on my solution.\r\n\r\nFire away! And thanks for any
  help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Outpatient_Services_6404.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Primary_Care_4995.png]\r\n\r\n"

    hole between the letters than it is with these unexpected ligatures. (\"SeNices\"?)\r\n\r\nYou'd
    be better off shortening the r and/or changing the angle of the v/y."

  body: "The first alternative is an interesting solution. Why not to let it available
    to users through a contextual alternate (stylistic set)?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion,
    Vesper Pro has the best solution for this: an arm-shortened /r/ and /v/y/ with
    smaller serifs, which are actived through contextual alternates \u2013 actually,
    the same as Eliason indicated. The serif family I'm building will adopt the same.\r\n\r\nThese
    /rv/ry/ ligatures are possible and seems to work, although I prefer a Vesper-like
    solution. I just would avoid to use them as default because they are out of the
    typographical standard.\r\n\r\nAnother experiments with ligatures for normal text
    (I mean, not with a lyrical/literary flavour) are found on Quadratta with /ch/
    and /ll/, digraphs largely used in Spanish."

    (and all the other counter spaces, such as Nick mentions) is why one might not
    want to track DIN so tight, regardless of how long the words are."

  body: "I am no expert(so you can get the layman's point of view) but I personally
    really don't give a rat's butt about the white space between the characters and
    neither does the 90%+ people who are going to read your typeface, as long as it
    is legible. If your modifications cause some distractions/disturbances to the
    flow, then it is bad. I personally consider a font to be a disaster if I stare
    at a pair of characters wondering why the designer did it. Acc. to me the best
    part of font design is ensuring that reader is never discomforted and doesn't
    have to wonder why you did what you did. \r\nP.S. I am novice and correct me if
    I am wrong.\r\nP.P.S. As a typeface designer one should be concerned more about
    the intended audience than their pet peeves."
