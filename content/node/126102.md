body: "\u2022 Omar Naskh is an amazing Naskh font having full Unicode support for
  Arabic script till Unicode version 9.0. The font covers all the languages of Arabic
  Script like Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki, Kazakh, Uyghur, Punjabi,
  Khowar (Chitrali), Malay (Jawi), Balochi, Brahui, Kurdi (Kurdish), Kashmiri (Koshur),
  Kirghiz, Ozbek, Turkmen, Gawri (Kalami) etc. etc.\r\n\u2022 The font also contains
  Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols. Range: 1EE00\u20131EEFF\r\n\u2022 The first
  true calligraphic Naskh font that has seven weights. Extralight, Light, Regular,
  Medium, Semibold, Bold and Heavy.\r\n\u2022 Control to use different shape alternates
  for marks.\r\n\u2022 Control to adjust space between words, normal spacing or condensed
  Naskh spacing or wide spacing.\r\n\u2022 The typeface provides three kinds of beautiful
  swashes for all letter shapes, smaller swashes, longer swashes and overlap swashes.\r\n\u2022
  An amazing feature of the font is 100% calligraphic tatweel (elongation and stretching
  of words) up to seven levels for all words shapes with auto-change of smaller marks
  to longer marks as tatweel extends,  so the Kashida distribution and frequence can
  be precisely controlled to create Arabic calligraphic documents without a calligrapher.\r\n\u2022
  Accurate marks positioning, horizontally centered, slightly above or below the letters,
  neither touching the letters nor colliding with adjacent marks.\r\n\u2022 Hundreds
  of kerning pairs for the fine adjustment of letters specially after Raa, Zaa, Waw
  and before Kaaf.\r\n\u2022 Special characters for modern and classic Arabic, such
  as Qur\u2019anic punctuation and Tajweed marks.\r\n\u2022 Beautiful justification
  alternates.\r\n\u2022 Proportional and tabular numerals.\r\n\u2022 An awesome and
  supreme Arabic font consisting of only 1800 Arabic glyphs."
