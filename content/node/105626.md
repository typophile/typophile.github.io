    seems to be a small size of type, which would explain the simplification of the
    blackletter to an almost monoline.\r\nI checked some of my reference files and
    I don't have a note for this one.\r\nAnyway, almost certain there is nothing digital.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Baskerville, Bodoni and Austin restyled and revived. These aren\u2019t strict
    revivals, for they are not accurate recreations, nor are they interpretations
    per se. Instead they reduce the historical models to their basic skeletal forms.
    Nine serrifed typefaces and one Blackletter reduced to their basic structure.
    This reduction strips them to their core, whilst at the same time retaining the
    life and spirit of the letters.\"\r\nDon\r\n"

    be trying to find the typeface in the Bruce catalog, Anglo Black is on page 179.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone finds an at least decent rendering of the Anglo Black alphabet, I might
    be interested in digitizing it into a font. Please let me know."

  body: "You're welcome Mike. I have seen additional letters but I can't recall offhand
    where this was. Anglo Gothic may have originated in England. It was registered
    by Miller & Richard in 1869. Perhaps one of our Typophiles in England, or elsewhere,
    has access to an old Miller & Richard  book with the font and could post a good
    quality scan or put it on a file hosting service if it is too large for a post
    at Typophile. \r\nUnfortunately for modern font makers, it was very rare for Victorian
    foundries to publish complete alphabets. This might be obtainable from the English
    registration or from a font acquired by the McBride Museum in England.\r\nDon"

  body: Can that catalog be downloaded? I'm not seeing a download button anywhere.
    This reminds me, do you have more sources of typefaces which have yet to be digitized?
    I would love to do a revival sometime.
