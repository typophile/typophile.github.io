  personality, characteristics etc of a typeface/font family. My typeface family is
  ITC Novarese.\r\n\r\nWhile I seem to have the font anatomy, origins and characteristics
  down pat, I am lacking any examples of where it has been used (advertising, magazine
  work etc). Does anyone know of any examples, brands, advertisements, buildings,
  etc that make good use of this font family?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
