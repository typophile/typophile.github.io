<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>When I've heard it from clients, usually there's merit in it, in that it implies that the client hasn't gotten what they want (now, what they want is another matter*) and they have something specific in mind. Then I have to gently tease the answer from them. <br> <br>If a 'creative' says it, then it usually means (in my experience) that they aren't good at their job or articulating what they should be able to articulate. <br> <br>With clients, I get it from people who almost inevitably say, "I'm not a very creative person. I mean, ::chuckle:: I can't even draw stick figures!" They probably have a style they're aiming for, but don't know what it's called. <br> <br>For me, it always comes back to client-designer communication. I spend a lot of my time at meetings encouraging the client to speak freely and openly, and have faith that their ideas have merit, even if they only end up informing the solution (rather than dictating it). They often end up surprising themselves, and end up liking something I've done that they never would've though of on their own, but feel they had a hand it creating. Does this get at what you're asking for? <br> <br>*sometimes my clients like crap, then it's a matter of trying to give them the crap in a well-made package.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Just round one of the corners. <br> <br>ROTFL <br> <br>Or add a lot of layers for a decidedly 90s design-y look. <br> <br>I think Chris' answer is excellent. Usually when you hear 'can you make it more designy' comments, it's from somebody who has a mental picture of something they think is particularly well designed or impressively designed. Sometimes to 'gently tease the answer from them' it's an exercise in doing something along the lines of 'Can you give me an example of something you think is particularly design-y?' <br> <br>I have found asking in advance for examples of things that the client likes or is impressed with gives a good clue about their level of expectations. It also affords you the opportunity to do a little compare and contrast if you think they have set their sights low: 'If you like that, maybe you'd like this even more (shows a better example)'. <br> <br>A lot of people think design (of anything) is decoration, and when they see austerity, plainness, clean and sharp layouts, they get scared that the designer hasn't been designing enough. If you tend towards rigorous minimalism or austerity, you need to educate the client about how hard it is to get meaningfully simple. <br> <br>Jon</div>

<div class=commentbody>We did a CD interface for a client recently, nothing cutting-edge, just a boring corporate presentation, constrained by their existing corporate ID.

<div class=commentbody>"<i>Sometimes to 'gently tease the answer from them' it's an exercise in doing something along the lines of 'Can you give me an example of something you think is particularly design-y?'</i>" <br> <br>A while ago, I had a meeting with a client who brought in examples (for a wedding invitation that was part print, part interactive CD) that were B&W photography under bright red type. This example scared me (not a very wedding-ish scheme, I had visions of U2's <i>War</i>), but it started an interesting conversation that ended up leading to something totally different (warm oranges, and muted color photography, with some graphic devices). <br> <br>It can be a double-edged sword, but I've lucked out. Have you had this technique backfire, Jon? I'm a bit hesitant to use this method, for fear of being boxed-in early on, even though it worked once.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I have generally been okay. I use this both in my job which is in-house at a major Canadian public library) and for my own projects outside of work which I am sad to say are very few and far bewtween. At the very first meeting (or before in an initial conversation) I outline my approach I ALWAYS express this request like this: <br> <br>In order for me to meet your expectations it's helpful to know what your expectations are, beyond the (specification/requirements/whatever). Can you gather some examples for me and make notes about exactly why you like the design. I'll meet with you and review them with you on (set a date at this point - don't leave it for later). This will help me understand your intent, and while I won't guarantee that you'll look EXACTLY like your examples I can assure you you'll look at least as good if not better in your own unique way. <br> <br>At that meeting when reviewing the examples make notes of words they say. They'll inevitably say stuff like "and thisa one because it looks so modern" which provide perefect opportunities to say "Modern? Is it the font (client speak) that makes you think that? The photographs?" And then write down the keyword MODERN. Over the course of 20minutes or a half hour you'll get a list of adjectives. These can be used to repeat back to the client and embedded in the specification and any reports. <br> <br>You'll be speaking their language. They gave you the words. You will have witnessed the equivalencies they will have shown you what they think is Bold or classic or friendly. All of this can be reinterpreted and when you show them your work you can show them how your design meets these expectations as well as meeting the spec. This is also helpful when you go: "We did thing A this way because we noted that all your competitors did thing A that way. We think this really stands out and looks keyword adjective) as well." <br> <br>You can expand this to include things they don't like but I did that once and backed myself into a corner because the design required the thing they didn't like. So I wouldn't recommend doing the negative thing. <br> <br>an example: <br>NEW <a href=http://www.infoaction.ca target=_blank>http://www.infoaction.ca</a> <br>OLD <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20011211232319/www2.vpl.vancouver.bc.ca/infoaction/ target=_blank>http://web.archive.org/web/20011211232319/www2.vpl.vancouver.bc.ca/infoaction/</a> <br> <br>Liked: <br>microsoft.com <br><a href=http://www.dnb.com/us/ target=_blank>http://www.dnb.com/us/</a> <br>some other business sites I can't remember <br> <br>Keywords that I still hear in my head: <br>Clean <br>Bright <br>Friendly <br>Dynamic <br>Clear <br>BUT business-like <br> <br>So there's an example, FWIW. <br> <br>Jon</div>
