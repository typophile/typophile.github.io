    and I wasn't involved with it last year. The client says it was sent in Freehand
    format, and I'm arguing for Illustrator. I know I'm repeating myself here, but
    the only reason I still have a PPC is my old friend  Freehand, that raises its
    ugly head every now and then, it refuses to die. Some of us are forced to use
    antique ;^)

    have to stick with the application it was created in. But I know Adobe was encouraging
    Pagemaker users to switch to InDesign a couple of years ago... <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/\">They
    had (or have) some sort of discount if you switched/upgraded to InDesign.</a>
    Besides, they stopped upgrading PM after version 7, if I'm not mistaken."

    book documents. I keep it on an older G4 along with other orphaned Mac software
    such as Streamline and Adobe Type Manager (for creating Multiple Master instances).
    \r\n\r\nInDesign (beginning with CS2) can convert PageMaker docs without problem
    except that it wipes out the kerning (actually a blessing). \r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    call PM \"crappy software.\" As I recall it WAS the page-layout program that started
    it all and has gotten us here today. Hmmm? I've done an awful lot of work with
    it and, quite frankly, typography and design have nothing to do with software.
    I've handset a lot of books in metal type as well so I think I could suggest that
    the execution of typography and design are also hardly dependent upon the newer
    than the newest technology.\r\n\r\nI do love working with InDesign (never liked
    Illustrator) but I can certainly do my work without it if need be.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n"

    is like pulling teeth sometimes.  \r\n\r\nAnd I absolutely hate that saved files
    have all the space hogging PDF crap tacked onto them.  I've saved files with and
    without PDF compatibility before and the size reduction from saving without PDF
    compatibility has been huge sometimes\u2014I remember one file was almost 18 megs
    with the PDF crap attached and without it went down to under a couple megs.  But
    if you save without the PDF compatibility you also lose the icon preview in the
    OS so it's one or the other.  Despite the fact that hard drives are very large
    now I do like to save space when I can."
