  that looks like rope. The reason is because it is fiber and so is textiles. Also,
  a bomb image is a common design element in the t-shirts, and the rope is supposed
  to reference the fuse of the bomb.\r\n\r\nHere are many versions I've played around
  with. \r\nAny ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, for I have spent
  so many hours on this already. Thank you.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention, the client
  also wants a sewing needle going through the C. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typofiles_4298.jpg]"

  body: 'Buddy, you should go for a logo which is simple rather than making it big
    and attractive. The Logo is something that reflects the brand name and simple
    brand logos always do the best. Anyway its your decision; I thought maybe sharing
    my opinion will help you. '

    with this."

  body: "I like the first one. But you should play a little more with the rope (it's
    pretty rigid at the moment, especially in the top right corner). Also, you should
    spell the name fully under it (including initial C).\r\nAs for illustrative vs
    simplified, it depends on display size and means of reproduction (that applies
    to the tiny type at the bottm too)"

  body: I like this idea, it seems to work.  I am not sure the distinction you are
    making between illustrative and simple shapes, in many ways I see this as both.  I
    would try to illustrate the ends of the rope rather than cut them.  Maybe try
    a cut perpendicular to the rope, or some sort of ends of the fibers.  I didn't
    get the bomb idea at all, but there seems to be potential to amp up that aspect.  Good
    start!  I do like the organic feel of rope weave together with a sort of geometric
    overall shape.  The needle feels a little like an afterthought.  Looking forward
    to seeing this develop.

    ideas aren't always the best solution. Maybe the \"rope\" idea is the best approach;
    maybe not. You might want to present other options too."

    is a problem that should be fixed?

  body: "That's my concern, too; the details are too small to hold up when the logo
    is small.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps it's just me, but the pin bothers me. I know pins
    are used in sewing, but I associate it with sticking myself and it really bothers
    me to see a sharp pin in a clothing logo."

  body: i would seriously rather use the middle/2nd C instead of the 3rd. i don't
    feel confident using the 3rd C. All those little details make it hard to control
    or keep track of. The simpler crafted D seems easier to control/handle. But I
    know the person I am designing this for is going to choose the 3rd because he
    likes those details. As for the pin, i know what you mean. It makes the logo seem
    kind of dangerous, like you might get poked.

  body: "> I know the person I am designing this for is \r\n> going to choose the
    3rd because he likes those details\r\n\r\nPersonally I wouldn't even show the
    client the third one.\r\n\r\nIf your client wants tiny details that you know won't
    reproduce well, you need to educate them about the requirements for a proper logo.
    Show them how the tiny details become a blur when reduced down to postage stamp
    size to fit on a business card or in a small ad. And show them examples of good
    logos which reproduce cleanly in small sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you do a Google images
    search for Rope Logo or Thread Logo (or similar phrases) you'll find examples
    of logos which represent those materials and yet are simple enough to reproduce
    cleanly in a small size.\r\n"

  body: This comment comes for an instruction writer for a needlecraft kit manufacturer,
    not a designer. However, I know fiber and needles. What you are depicting is not
    rope, it's a braid. Rope is a single twist; it is not interwoven. Look at a piece
    of rope, twine, or thread for that matter and you will know what I mean. It would
    also help if you had the "rope" go more convincingly through the eye of the needle,
    along with the needle actually piercing the rope. Enlarge the eye if need be.
    I think this is why some are reading it as a pin instead of a needle. Hope this
    along with the other comments helps.

  body: yeah. i should have never shown the 3rd sample. he told me that he and his
    friends like the 3rd one. not to be pessimistic, but I don't think my opinion
    is going to change the decision he and his friends have made.

  body: "What is the market positioning for the new logo, is there a specific demographic
    that will be targeted by the brand. To me the name seems to have 2 distinct connotations,
    the first is that this work is hand crafted, the second - now this may be a local
    perception - I am a New Zealander - to us, crafty means clever, cunning, normally
    with a negative spin. In the latter context, it would work well for a street label,
    in that case it would need attitude. Rereading the first entry I see that you
    mention a bomb symbol or graphic and T shirts so i assume it is a street brand.
    If this is the case maybe you need to get a bit more funky, especially if it is
    a label that you want to built a culture behind. The use of the letters C R F
    T Y reminds me of the very successful UK brand FCUK.\r\n\r\nDon't get caught up
    in the details before you have worked out the strategy and market positioning
    of the finished brand. I agree with the other responses that mention issues that
    can arise from being able to embroider the labels.\r\n\r\nI think the needle graphic
    has some great potential"
