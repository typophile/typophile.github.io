    part of the charme of an experiment that you don&#39;t know the results. Although
    it would be nice to have an ex-post-analysis of, say, the 80s/90s post-digital-typographic-experimentation,
    I don&#39;t think it should matter to those who DO the experiments what is the
    actual outcome of their work. I think in experimentating, the process, the finding-out-about-things
    or the plaing-around-without-things is very much in the foreground, it is very
    much an explorative, not a teleological animal. '

    <BR> <BR>Experimental is typically used, in reference to type design and typography,
    as a lazy term to <i>avoid analysis</i>. Unorthodox design is explained away as
    &#39;experimental&#39;, often as a means of ducking criticism of the results.
    There is a presupposition that all experiments are successful experiments, justified
    entirely by their experimental nature rather than by either their goals or their
    results. True experimental design follows an experimental path: hypothesis, procedure,
    analysis. <BR> <BR>If you want to see amazing experimental type design and typography,
    take a look at the work of the Didots and Bodoni.'

    process that leads from an idea to observation and conclusion &#40;not necessarily,
    nor even likely, a final conclusion, but a judgement&#41;. Playing-around, exploring
    and experimenting are three different activities: they may overlap insofar as

    play by suggesting a scientific rigour that it didn&#39;t possess. Lewis Blackwell&#39;s
    books about David Carson are prime examples. The same sort of thing happens when
    the jargon of critical theory -- itself an appropriation of scientific and pseudo-scientific

    underestimate the vacuity of much of the design industry, and should be wary when
    it starts using impressive sounding words. Erik Spiekermann made this point at

    <BR> <BR>How so? <BR> <BR>I guess we need a real-world example of a typeface that
    has <BR>been described as experimental: HTF Gestalt. <BR> <BR>From the HTF site:
    &#34;Gestalt is an experimental typeface &#40;that&#41; <BR>explores this idea,
    most of its letterforms being indecipherable  <BR>out of context but far more

    different, provocative&#34;. <BR> <BR>If Patria II was an experiment, let&#39;s
    say, and you followed some sort <BR>of Type Designer&#39;s Scientific Method,
    and the result was a text <BR>face that looked like Underwood, calling it experimental

    of stuff that <i>looks</i> experimental, i.e. novel and unorthodox. One way to
    clarify this would be to ask what is counter to experimental typography: presumably
    that which is based on known results, i.e. prior experiment or discovery. Above,
    I mentioned the types and typography of the Didots and Bodoni as examples of experimental
    typography, and if we no longer think of a block of text on a relatively narrow
    width, with generous leading, set in a Didot or Bodoni type as &#39;experimental&#39;
    it is because we have analysed and understood the results of that experiment.'

    funding. I don&#39;t know how familiar you are with American academia over the
    past ten years, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, but in my
    view &#40;and for many others&#41; lots of scholarship in these otherwise worthwhile
    subjects has been wasted on things like identity politics. I ran into this issue
    in pursuing my own degree &#40;in German&#41; and ended up having to make a rather
    painful decision not to go to grad school.  <BR> <BR>Nothing personal, but I get
    really tired really quickly explaining the problem, because it&#39;s been covered
    so well elsewhere already, so please just consult the Sokal book I cited if you

    in the humanities in North America. In fact, one could argue that the paranoid
