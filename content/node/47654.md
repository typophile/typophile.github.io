  body: "There are many directions you could take this in - perhaps a good place to
    start would be to dig up some old star maps and consider the language you find
    there? Just speaking formally, I would try to work with a typeface which features
    a weight complementary to the line width in the illustration. Your current selection
    is dominated, visually, by the drawing of the observatory.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
