  body: 'Hmm. I assume you mean relatively unknown female type designers? You could
    call Zuzana Licko or Carol Twombly, but they may be busy. If I might ask: why
    are you actively searching for female type designers? '

  body: hehe...I know it seems strange, but we are now representing 20 designers,
    and I find it odd that they are all male. <BR> <BR>I just wondered where all the
    young unknown female font designers are. <BR> <BR>Maybe they have there own secret

  body: Hey Jim,  <BR> <BR>I could be interested, I&#39;m really stuck with school
    for the next 3 weeks but then I&#39;ll be out and I&#39;m really planning to get
    my typography skills polished when I have more time and try getting some stuff
    out there. I have some stuff started but I didn&#39;t dare putting anything on
    the chopping block so far =&#41; <BR> <BR>Em

  body: 'Three very talented type designers come immediately to mind: Freda Sack &#40;The
    Foundry, UK&#41;, Shelley Winter &#40;UK&#41; and Jane Patterson &#40;Design Lab,
    Italy&#41;. But I don&#39;t think any of them are likely to be looking for representation,
    either because they have their own sucessful companies or, in Shelley&#39;s case,
    focus on custom work not retail fonts.'
