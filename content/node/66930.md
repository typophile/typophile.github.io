  body: "BE indicated that fonts were developed by Adobe; BQ indicates the data was
    developed by Berthold. I have to admit that the Berthold site doesn't clear up
    the matter for me. The various packages seem to all include the original small
    caps and oldstyle figures, but it isn't clear whether single OT fonts include
    all of them together. \r\n\r\nThere aren't any other versions of Christiana out
    there; they all come from Berthold. If you want to be certain, go to the source,
    and make sure to get a character map of the various versions for comparison. "
