  project on 60s/70s conceptual art in Amsterdam and need some help with typeface
  selection. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

  body: What about Museo by Jos Buivenga. I'd say that's a very clean typeface. Or
    do you want soemthing from the 60s/70s?

    a clean monospaced grotesque by Pieter van Rosmalen. Or if you\u2019re looking
    for a more humanistic approach check out [[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/flex/|Flex]]
    by Paul van der Laan.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
