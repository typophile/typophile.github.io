  body: "Do you mean <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_typeface_6_7/?&sample_text=QoMPENDIUM&sample_size=48\">FF
    Typeface 6 and 7</a>? Yes, they have that Mackintosh-style superscript O, but
    are too spiky and funky.\r\nIn overall apperance, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/p22/p22_underground_demi_small_caps/?&sample_text=QOMPENDIUM&sample_size=48\">P22
    Underground</a> comes pretty close.\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/duty/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D76%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DQOMPENDIUM%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D16\">Duty</a>
    has the flattened M vertex, but isn\u2019t geometric enough."
