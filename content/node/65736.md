  local guidelines \u2013 so that one could leave the global ones locked, but still
  edit the local ones? Or am I the only one who'd find that handy?\r\n(Or maybe it's
  actually possible and I just don't know how?)"

  body: That would be useful. I avoid using local guidelines because I have to remember
    to lock them afterwards.

    mistake, then I get fed up and lock them, but then I'm not as flexible as I'd
    like to be in working with the local ones."

    about such a feature.
