body: "I am in the process of making a book about my father's art. Some of his art
  has some reminiscence of renaissance while other more contemporary. Poetry and conveying
  of feelings are key elements. Hence my goal is to use fontfaces that share some
  of these characteristics. So far I have,after research both on this forum and other
  places,ended up with the following: \r\n\r\nEssay 8 pages:\r\nMain heading Frutiger
  Lt Std (45 Light 18 pt)\r\nCaption headings  Frutiger Lt Std (45 Light 12 pt)\r\nBody
  text  Kepler Std (Light 11 pt)\r\n\r\nI am most worried about the Kepler because
  it doesn't seem to be much used, for instance it is not on Linotype body text recommendation
  list. I want to be a little different, but still very reader friendly. Also I feel
  Kepler Std Regular is a bit too black and heavy, however the light version is maybe
  too light (especially the top of letters a, c and o almost fades away). My desktop
  printer is very good (Canon i9100) so that should not be a problem.\r\n\r\nDoes
  my Frutiger/Kepler combo make sense or I am doing something very wrong here?\r\n\r\nExample

  body: "\"I am most worried about the Kepler because it doesn\u2019t seem to be much
    used, for instance it is not on Linotype body text recommendation list.\"\r\n\r\nKepler
    has size variants specially designed for text, by Robert Slimbach of Adobe. Linotype's
    list is drawn from Linotype's library exclusively. It is also a very small and
    conservative selection of faces for text. Certain faces in their list are not
    really appropriate for extended reading. For instance Metro, Helvetica, and Bell
    Gothic were never intended for extended reading, and do not perform well in that
    setting. The list has almost no value except as a sales tool for Linotype.\r\n\r\nIn
    the US, designers follow extremely conservative conventions for the use of text
    type. New designs, often better engineered for extended reading, are passed over
    in favor of the safe classics like Garamond and Times. Times itself was designed
    for letterpress and was not carefully adapted for digital imaging. It is less
    than comfortable to read at small sizes. \r\n\r\nAs long as you are using the
    text versions of Kepler (or any other design), you should have no problems. An
    additional benefit is that your documents will have some visual distinction, as
    the use of newer text designs is still so rare. Please take a look at some new
    text typefaces; you may discover that they perform better and offer greater flexibility
    and range than older faces that seem more safe:\r\n\r\nKepler\r\nWarnock\r\nFF

    designs, often better engineered for extended reading, are passed over in favor
    of the safe classics like Garamond and Times.\"\r\nI tried Garamond(Adobe Garamond
    Pro), but found it too \"old\"looking. Warnock was a bit round for my taste. I
    want somewhat fresh look.\r\n\r\nAny input on Kepler Std regular versus Kepler
    Std light?\r\nI like Light the best, but am worried that it is too light(legible)?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I get the impression that many tweak the leading settings. Do you often go wrong
    on auto leading(InDesign CS)?\r\n\r\nSorry if my questions are elementary:)"

  body: "I think reading this would be more pleasant if the type were 10 or 10.3 points,
    with a point more leading, and if you selected the \"Caption\" optical size. That
    variant probably has looser letterspacing built into it, so you would gain clarity
    from that. The Light weight might still be a problem; depending on the audience
    for your book, and on the printing technology, consider using the regular weight
    as well. For the ultimate test, ask a 70-year-old to read it. \r\n\r\nI don't
    mean Linotype is conservative per se, but their list reflects their motive to
    sell their own fonts. It isn't a good general guide, as it omits so many useful
    typefaces. "

  body: My take on the combination is with the text, it could use more leading. The
    leading would create a better gray balance on the page.
