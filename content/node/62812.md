body: "I\u2019m a MFA student at Parsons the New School Of Design at NY, USA. For
  my Master\u2019s thesis I am pursuing a typeface design project -\r\n\r\nABSTRACT:\r\nEnglish
  + Hindi = Hinglish\r\n\u201CHinglish\u201D is emerging as a commonly spoken language
  in India and amongst Indians living in USA and UK. It is used vocally, while chatting
  and it is often seen in popular culture such as TV shows, Movies, Books, Magazines,
  Chat rooms, Song lyrics etc.\r\n\r\nI want to design TWO display fonts that reflect
  this notion of being Hinglish. - A Latin (English) font that is influenced by Indian
  Culture and a Devnaagri (Hindi) font that is influenced by Western Culture. I hope
  to create a scenario for compare and contrast with my two fonts that can both reflect
  the notion of being cross-cultural.\r\n\r\nPlease check my blog for progress, please
  feel free to comment-\r\n\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Thesis1\r\n\r\nThank
  you\r\nRohini\r\n\r\n"
