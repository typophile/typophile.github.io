  body: "I remember that in an earlier discussion of overused typefaces, such as Papyrus
    and Comic Sans, there was some controversy over whether it was fair to include
    Hobo on the list of faces to avoid.\r\n\r\nI was looking through an old Letraset
    catalog, and noticed two display faces whose names I had not previously known.\r\n\r\nOne,
    I thought, was a good candidate for the list - as a face that could easily be
    considered overused with only a little use. At the moment, though, it isn't often
    seen, which has saved it from that. I thought it was mostly associated with games
    like Dungeons and Dragons, but then I remembered its use as the original face
    for the logo of Creative Computing magazine: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/pretorian-dt/|Pretorian]].
    Originally a Letraset face, it has been revived.\r\n\r\nAnother Letraset face,
    Transmission, was used when [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/countdown-lt/|Countdown]]
    or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/data-seventy/|Data '70]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/amelia/|Amelia]]
    just wouldn't do for a modern, futuristic look for a computer product. I recall
    it, I think, from a line of inexpensive floppy disks. It does not seem to be currently
    available. (There is a plain sans-serif font called \"Transmission\", but it is
    unrelated.)"

  body: Transmission was by Martin Wait and was eventually adapted into his font called
    <a href="http://www.martinwait.co.uk/">Company</a>, wasn't it? I'll look it up
    in my catalogue later, but I'm pretty sure it was, though Transmission was lined
    or dotted or not-quite-black in some other way, I believe.

  body: Yes, Transmission was lined. It was a slab-serif font with the vertical strokes
    bowed out.
