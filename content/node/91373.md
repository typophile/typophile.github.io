  body: "I think it's the layout of the opening forum page that's confusing. It appears
    that the highest level is \"Type ID Board\" and that 'serif' is a sub-category.
    The intermediate level  'Solved IDs' is visually skipped over.\r\n\r\nI'd organize
    the display quite differently, putting 'Solved ID's at the same level as 'Font
    ID Requests', and at the same time restricting the ability to post to any of its
    subtopics to an administrator, OR by an OP's clicking on a 'solved' or 'solution
    accepted' button.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
