body: "Looking to ID the \"Piedmont\" typeface here. It's somewhat geometric (similar
  to Futura or Gotham) but the \"M\" has the sloped sides. Bureau Eagle is similar
  but has the pointed vertices for the \"M\" and \"N.\"\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, also would
  like to know what \"Garage Doors\" is set in as well.\r\n\r\nI think we all know
  the other typeface here. And the likely story behind it (\"Can you open this in
  Word and just add \"A Brenner Family...\" along the bottom? Yes! Perfect!\")\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image001_4818.png]"

  body: "Yep, I think you're right. The Extra Black looks like a match. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAnyone
    know what the \"Garage Doors\" face is? Close to Avant Garde but the \"G\" is
    different."
