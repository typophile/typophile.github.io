  I came up with very quickly. I figured some better trained eyes might be able to
  help me steer in the right direction before I get too far.\r\nAt this point I'm
  looking at the arms of the \"E\" and \"C\" and how they compare... I gave the c
  some added weight on the bottom to maybe compensate for the lack of weight that
  the e has in the middle? I'm not sure if that's wise, but I also don't want them
  to look cloned. (I'm also not liking that wedge on the e, which I attempted for
  the same purpose).\r\n\r\nTear it apart!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Echo_3602.gif]"

  body: I think the 2nd and 3rd from the top are both a good start. The 4th creates
    a very weird word shape. And maybe puts emphasis in an odd place too?

  body: "I think the 3rd is the best of them. I keep wondering how this would look
    in a non-allcaps solution (meaning The Echo, or the Echo) for more even flow and
    easier readability. Also you might want to look at underware's Fakir as an inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    second feels a little comic-book, but that could be me...\r\n\r\njust my 2C, with
    a grain of salt please.\r\n"

  body: "Ha, Fakir was a huge inspiration. I would actually like to use a fakir for
    the nameplate, but as a part money-saving method / part learning experience, I
    decided to try and go manual. The third is the best I think.. And maybe I'll give
    the lowercase a shot now.\r\nIs it too AC/DC?"

  body: The simplified shadow is better. Maybe pull back on the lowest bar on the
    E in the EC pair to keep letters from overlapping?

  body: "This latest version looks really nice. I'd pick up that paper for sure. \r\n\r\nThe
    left shadow works better not only because it's not blurred, but because it's less
    complex. See how many fewer bits are involved in the 'E', for example? This is
    a good example of how we can learn from signpainters. They rarely do shadows on
    the right, for just that reason.\r\n\r\nGood tip from Tiff. Also, now that you've
    lightened everything the crossbars on the 'H' and 'E' are probably a bit too light.
    From a distance you see TIIC or THC."

    I can understand the reasoning of this (the left sides of the characters are simpler).
    I've always understood is was more 'natural' to have the light come from the left
    side. The shadow cast on the right side will then make the characters 'pop' against
    the reading direction, towards the viewer (instead of away from the viewer)."

  body: Your last design is really, really good! I agree on Tiffany and Stephen's
    suggestions. The only other thing that bothers me ever so slightly, is the repeated,
    identical "E"s. (Not a fault, it's just a little boring.) But follow Tiffany's
    advice, and they'll no longer be identical. Great work!

  body: "Thanks for the pointers.. I'll try altering the weight of the crossbars,
    and messing with the e's.\r\nMaybe the double e wouldn't seem so evident if I
    stacked the words on top of each other? I'm also not liking that visual effect...\r\nOthers
    who I've showed this too feel like it's too gothic/rockband looking? Do you think
    that's an issue?\r\nHere's a mock of the top of a frontpage, just to see it in
    context. I don't mind the edge, really.\r\nAlso keep in mind I haven't made changes
    to the type itself...\r\nLet me know!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EchoWhite_4050.gif]"

    looks like a rockband really; not when it's in context at least.
