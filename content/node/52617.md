  sorry, but I have no idea of how else to describe it.) In particular, I'm looking
  for a nice \"and\". I believe that Adobe Wood Type Ornaments has one, but it is
  not exactly what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/and_5076.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: Thank you both. Still not quite what I'm looking for. I guess I wasn't really
    clear--I'm looking for something similar to the example I posted. Nothing in the
    FontBook really comes close (I looked in the "symbols" section).
