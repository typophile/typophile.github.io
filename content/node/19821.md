  body: I'm willing to take a look if you want. I'm not sure I can be of assistance,
    but the topic is interesting. Recently I came across a typeface that had really,
    really high ascenders; it wouldn't work properly in Quark even though it might
    have technically been legal within the PostScript specification. Is there anything
    unusal about your glyphs that you can think of?

      send them -- mine's john@bookcraft.co.uk\r\nIt's only 6 out of 40 new glyphs
      that are causing a problem; I suspect it's something to do with composite outlines\r\nAll
      best wishes\r\nJohn"
