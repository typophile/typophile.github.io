    body: For Mac OS X, use FontDoctor for diagnosis and repair, and FontAgent Pro
      for central font management, ignoring (but not disabling) the native Apple FontBook,
      which is good only for the fonts that come loaded in it (most of which have
      to be disabled so as not to junk up your Quark font menu). Keep all your fonts
      in a folder on the desktop; check them in FontDoctor while in that folder, then
      import them into FontAgent Pro from that folder. Don't load any fonts into a
      "system" folder inside your OSX Library; that's only for system fonts that come
      with your Mac.
