body: 'I have tried to create TTF and OTF fonts &#40;using FontLab for Mac&#41; that
  would work cross-platform. Everything is perfectly fine until I come to the part
  where the grouping in font families does come in. Is there a way to create a TTF/OTF
  font file that would show up with a submenu &#40;say Helvetica Neue as the main
  font menu item and then 33 variations of it as its submenu items&#41; so that it
  would work the same way in BOTH Mac and PC? <BR> <BR>I have tried many different
  combinations but there&#39;s always a problem on one of the platforms. If I get
  decent submenus on the Mac, the font won&#39;t work on a PC &#40;it can then only
  have 4 submenu items&#41;. And if I name the fonts so that they show up on a PC
  &#40;basically fill all the font info into all the name fields in FontLab - i.e.
  &#39;HelveticaNeue-LightExtended&#39; for every field&#41;,  the Mac font menu becomes
  huuuuuge. <BR> <BR>Is there some way to solve this problem? Maybe you can briefly
  explain the standards &#40;if there are any?&#41; of naming decent cross-platform
  fonts? Or point out some tutorials? <BR> <BR>Thanks! '

  body: Most PC applications, and indeed windows itself only recognise 4 members of
    any given family.  AFAIK, only Adobe programmes can recognise more, but they use
    their own font technology.

    to workaround this restriction is by using some &#34;font naming strategy&#34;.'

  body: 'Typical Windows apps have a fixed family size of 4 or less fonts: regular,
    italic, bold and bold italic. If you have a larger family, you need to creatively
    name the fonts into discreet four-font families, e.g.: <BR> <BR>MyFont <BR> MyFont-Regular
    <BR> MyFont-Italic <BR> MyFont-Bold <BR> MyFont-Bold Italic <BR> <BR>MyFont Light
    <BR> MyFontLight-Regular <BR> MyFontLight-Italic <BR> <BR>MyFont Bold <BR> MyFontBold-Regular
    <BR> MyFontBold-Italic <BR> <BR>However, while you still need to do this for any
    TT and OT font, the latest versions of the name table specification include a
    second set of OpenType preferred family and subfamily names, which are what Adobe
    apps reference in menus and what future MS and other apps will use. Using the
    same example as above, the OT preferred family name could be set to &#39;MyFont&#39;,
    with the preferred subfamily names as indicated in brackets below: <BR> <BR>MyFont
    <BR> MyFont-Regular [Regular] <BR> MyFont-Italic [Italic] <BR> MyFont-Bold [Semibold]
    <BR> MyFont-BoldItalic [Semibold Italic] <BR> <BR>MyFont Light <BR> MyFontLight-Regular
    [Light] <BR> MyFontLight-Italic [Light Italic] <BR> <BR>MyFont Bold <BR> MyFontBold-Regular
    [Bold] <BR> MyFontBold-Italic [Bold Italic] <BR> <BR>You can set OT preferred
    family and subfamily names in FontLab, on the second panel of the FontInfo window.'

  body: Hey, that old thread is pretty informative. I think I already said most of
    what I wanted to back then in July/August. <BR> <BR>I just remembered that I have
    a PDF from a presentation specifically on the name table that I put together fresh
    and updated for the OpenType workshop at ATypI Vancouver. I&#39;ll see about getting
    it posted here or on the Adobe Web site &#40;or perhaps both&#41;. <BR> <BR>T
