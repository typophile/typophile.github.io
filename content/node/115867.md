body: "This is less of a question, but more of an interesting read: [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1775|Fun
  with Fonts: Algorithmic Typography]]. The actual PDF can be downloaded from the
  link in the upper-right.\r\n\r\nFrom the abstract: Over the past decade, we have
  designed five typefaces based on mathematical theorems and open problems, specifically
  computational geometry. These typefaces expose the general public in a unique way
  to intriguing results and hard problems in hinged dissections, geometric tours,
  origami design, physical simulation, and protein folding. In particular, most of
  these typefaces include puzzle fonts, where reading the intended message requires
  solving a series of puzzles which illustrate the challenge of the underlying algorithmic
  problem.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)"

    all, PostScript, which is the medium in which almost all typefaces are now designed,
    is inherently algorithmic. Interpolation, for instance, is algorithmic.\r\n\r\nHere
    is an interesting area of \u201Calgorithmic\u201D type design, termed \u201Cparametric\u201D:\r\nhttps://www.typotheque.com/fonts/elementar/about"
