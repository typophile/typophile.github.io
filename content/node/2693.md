  It doesn&#39;t seem to affect anything, nor on screen or print, so I&#39;m not sure
  what it means, but nonetheless it&#39;s a bit annoying: <BR> <BR>Could not embed
  font &#40;FONT NAME&#41;. Protected fonts can not be embeded.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  using Fontographer 4.14, and Illustrator 9 for PC.'

  body: The problem is that your fonts have a font embedding setting that is either
    nonsense/garbage or says they can&#39;t be embedded. <BR> <BR>My first recommendation
    would be to get a real font editor, like FontLab, TypeTool or FontMaster. Fontographer
    hasn&#39;t been updated in about 7 years, so there&#39;s not much hope they&#39;ll
    fix this. <BR> <BR>Failing that, do a search on Macromedia&#39;s web site for
    a tech doc on font embedding settings. On the Mac version of Fontographer there
    is some sort of hack to fix this, and presumably there is on Windows as well.
    <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I had the same Problem with PDF embedding and I solved it with a little tool
    on the MS Website. You can edit all &#34;font info&#34; with it and also change
    the level of embedding. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the link <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/property/property.htm?fname=%20&amp;fsize="
    target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/property/property.htm?fname=%20&amp;fsize=</a>
    <BR> <BR>There is also a tech doc on the macromedia website, but it tells you
    merely to use the tool from MS. <BR> <BR>Servus  <BR> <BR>Dominik
