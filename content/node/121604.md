  cap A has a pretty unique diagonal crossbar but this hasn't helped me to identify
  the font so far. Also the 'inner' serifs on the cap 'N' don't look standard. It
  may be that someone has customised a font to create this look so if you know what
  it could be based on that would be really helpful too.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,
  G"

  body: "I suspect that this was customized, either using an A, or inverting a V.
    I couldn't find a serif font with an A like this. The serif brackets looked uneven,
    making me wonder if the whole thing has been 'tweaked' from an existing font.
    Using \"WhatFontIs\" the first font suggested as a match was Albert Boton's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/carre-noir/?refby=bowfin|Carre
    Noir]]. You might look at that as a potential starting point.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Actually, there is a hand-drawn serif font with an A sort of like this. See
    Victor de Castro's [[http://www.unifonts.com/h_pages/hudsonserifregular.htm|Hudson
    Serif]]. It doesn't match your sample at all, but I think it's a novel, stylish
    font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
