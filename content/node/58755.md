  Newest, and Hand Picked areas of the Flash box are just small red rectangles, and
  the text from the most recent post is taking up the whole screen. Anybody else seeing
  this?'

    properly yesterday either. Perhaps they're doing upgrades behind the scenes.

  body: '@Gus  That looks like it is failing to grab the three post categories properly
    from the database. When it can''t pull data, the flash player just leaves those
    little small red rectangles as it waits. Something might have been borked yesterday
    with the fixes to the search (or other bug fixings).'

    I get everything except the rectangles and posts. There''s that huge background
    quote (which currently featured your comment, aaronbell) and nothing else. '

  body: "Yeah, the background pulls in the most recent quotes and overlays them with
    decreasing opacity. Rather pretty effect (even though the usage of flash & database
    calls causes safari to crash).\r\n\r\nBut yeah, I'm seeing it on ff and safari
    on the mac.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the browser is getting back the XML from the
    server with the \"hot,\" \"newest\" and \"hand picked,\" but Flash isn't rendering
    them properly. Ah well, I'm sure the site admins will get around to fixing it. "
