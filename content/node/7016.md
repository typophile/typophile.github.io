  body: If you ask me, it looks like someone hand-traced and simplified Image Club&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?8F2">Paisley One</a> and then pasted clip
    art flowers all over it.

    <BR> <BR>My basic approach: if it looks like someone traced something, it&#39;s
    probably a free font.'

  body: DaFont, of course... no wonder it <b>looks</b> derived from Paisley. Hmph.

    link to the free-fonts-sie. I guess...

  body: On that note Yves, I went to a free font site and saw something called Hannible
    Lecture which was a direct rip-off of Cezanne, I contacted P22 and they of course
    were on top of it. It turns out that the guy who has the free font site touts
    himself to be a big time Christian and Richard&#39;s comment to me was it isn&#39;t
    a very Christian thing to do to promote ripping off other peoples intellectual
    property. FYI
