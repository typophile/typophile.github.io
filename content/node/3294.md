  body: I couldn&#39;t find it on MyFonts or DaFont, so I&#39;m inclined to think
    that they developed it themselves. It&#39;s pretty clearly derived from Futura
    Bold Condensed.

  body: 'On a similar topic, I wonder if someone here can illuminate something I&#39;ve
    wondered about for some time: a lot of grunge/distressed faces out there for sale
    are clearly derived from classic designs &#40;it&#39;s obvious that P22&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/fontasaurus/">Fontasaurus</a> is just
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/bold/testdrive.html?s=ABCDEFGHIJKLMN&amp;p=48">Optima
    Bold</a> printed out, scuffed up, redigitized, and posted for sale -- and this
    is only one of several examples I can think of&#41;. It&#39;s one thing to do
    that and put it out there for free &#40;or in the case with XSBlast, developing
    it for one&#39;s own use&#41;, but it seems to me to be quite something else to
    charge for piggybacking so heavily on someone else&#39;s work. <BR> <BR>Am I overreacting?'

  body: <i>Am I overreacting?</i> <BR> <BR>Not really. I seem to remember that some
    font companies had  <BR>quite strict guidelines about submitting &#34;grunged&#34;
    fonts based  <BR>on existing typefaces at the height of the grunge boom in the  <BR>nineties.
    I&#39;ll try to track down that document and post it.

  body: However, from what I know about copyright law in the US, it&#39;s perfectly
    legal to do it. Due to a really early ruling about typefaces, the only thing you
    can copyright is the name of the face, not the design of it. Thusly, that is why
    on every typesetting system there are fonts that look alike, but have different
    names &#40;Helvetica, Heldustry, Arial, etc&#41;. Sometimes the rip off wouldn&#39;t
    be blatant, but would contain subtle changes &#40;like Arial&#41;. Othertimes
    it would be pretty much a 100% grab &#40;Futura&#39;s clone 20th Century from
    Monotype&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think there has been good movement to protect typeface
    designs in Europe, but it will probably be years before that makes it&#39;s way
    to the US.
