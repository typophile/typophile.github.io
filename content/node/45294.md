  body: "Stefan, I love using Sophisto. Quirky in all the right places, and easy to
    work with. \r\n\r\nAs Linda mentioned, a lot of the May meeting will be about
    letterpress. And we'll talk about Linda's recent escapades in America, and the
    Typophiles she met with. Hopefully, we'll also get an update on Lex's movie.\r\n\r\nEverybody
    is welcome. (Though I realize a lot of you will have a bit of a commute.)"

    on the poster set in URW Bee....  ;-)

    that was some other font.
