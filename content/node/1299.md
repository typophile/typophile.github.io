  there, I think. I would welcome any suggestions. <BR> <BR>cr <BR> <BR><!-Attachment:

    this was discussed in another thread. <BR> <BR>What might be a fun discussion
    is the methodology / process of creating a text face. <BR> <BR>Maybe Hrant, Kent,
    Jacques, David, Christian, John Butler and others who have put together successful
    text faces can give us some insight as to where they start &#40;fontographer,
    illustrator&#41; and how they work. Is it all pen tool operations, or are there
    other methods, like Christian&#39;s.? <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: ' This design presents a dilemma. <BR>To me the centerpiece is the &#34;g&#34;
    &#40;although it could just be me&#41; - it can be argued that the join between
    the bowls &#40;in the traditional bicam structure&#41; is superfluous, and you&#39;ve
    gotten rid of it very nicely: on its own your glyph looks like a legitimate alphabetic
    character. <BR> <BR>The question is, how much of that approach do you apply to
    the other letters? The &#34;a&#34; works well, and the &#34;p&#34; has merit,
    but if you take it too far the font might become a parody. In fact it&#39;s not
    inconceivable to me to make &#42;only&#42; the &#34;g&#34; unorthodox, and build
    the rest as a traditional text face. The interesting result might be a font that
    some people will discredit as half-baked, some people will love without knowing
    -or caring- why, and &#42;everybody&#42; will have something to saw about that
    &#34;g&#34; - in part a promotional trick that Carter often mentions as Spiekermann
    having revealed to him &#40;concerning Meta, although it could very well have
    been post-rationalization&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you do that, you must not provide
    a traditional &#34;g&#34; as an alternate. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' There has been some discussion in these forums about faces that have only
    one or two odd-ball characters. It seems that some don&#39;t like them, but I
    really do. It seems like a good way to push the boundries of what&#39;s acceptable.
    They also makes for really interesting text faces, I think. I don&#39;t think
    that the &#39;speed bump&#39; created by some wacky characters really causes a
    problem, if they are done right. For some reason g&#39;s and Q&#39;s give a lot
    of room for expression, but I also really like the &#39;a&#39; and the &#39;k&#39;
    for their expressive potential. <BR> <BR>I am undecided about the a and the p,
    to be completely honest. They almost seem contrived, like they are an excuse to
    keep the g that I like so much. I don&#39;t think that I would provide an alternate
    g, though I did right here... <BR> <BR>Note to BJ- I think you still have a flash
    4 player. You can upgrade quickly and easily with the link in my last post. '

    to the driver. <BR> <BR>Could you set some text in this? <BR> <BR>&#62; a and
