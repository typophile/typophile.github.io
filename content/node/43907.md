body: "Hi, \r\nRecently my PC had a meltdown and I lost everything on it, unfortunately
  I hadn't backed up all my fonts. This is the Under Construction splash for my webpage,
  I would really like to use this font again, but I can't remember what it's called!
  Stupid I know but any help would be appreciated. Not sure of the origin, while at
  Design School a disc was handed around with alot of type foundry fonts on it and
  I'm pretty sure this was one of them. "

    sad but common story. If you want to use it for your commercial work, you'll need
