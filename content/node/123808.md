body: "Proudly announcing the completion of a type projected I started as a teenager
  in Palestine around 1961 - AlQuds ('Holy One' the Arabic name for Jerusalem) is
  probably the first Arabic San-serif type design. I discussed it with Monotype and
  Letraset in England in 1965. A special version for Deco Type's Tasmeem InDesign
  plug-in was released in 2007,  and now finally the OpenType version of two AlQuds
  families with 6 fonts each was just released by Monotype in 2015. Do the math -
  50 years later!\r\nGrateful thanks to all who encouraged, or offered invaluable
  technical advice in this work. Apart from the inspiration of Eric Gill's San-Serif
  and book on typography, a meeting with the late Nasri Khattar and correspondence
  with the late Hiromo Hara, most of you are here at Typophile:  Mamoun Sakkal, Nadine
  Chahine, John Hudson, Thomas Milo, Tiffany Wardle de Sousa, Karsten Lueke,  Saad
  Abulhab, Claudio Piccinini, Titus Nemeth, Aziz Mostafa,  Malcolm Wooden, Zuhair
  Albazi and others, and last but not least Hasan Abu Afash without his VOLT expertise
  the project could not have been completed properly! \r\nhttp://vladimirtamari.com/alquds/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlQuds
