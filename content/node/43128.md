  was recently assigned a research project for typography on a type designer. The
  designer that I received is [[John Downer]]. I am have some trouble finding the
  resources and information I need. The largest  issue that I am having is finding
  information that is considered an article. I am only allowed 2 internet sources
  the rest have to be from articles and books and I need 6 sources total. I was looking
  to see if some one could point me in the right direction of where to look. I would
  appreciate the help.\r\nThank You.    "

    book about John Downer coming out and teaching them some stuff, try playing that
    one up. Also, have you tried searching <em>The Design and Applied Arts Index</em>
    for articles? I find that it\u2019s often the only useful database for tracking
    down good stories about designers, especially type designers. If your school library
    doesn\u2019t have access to that database, get the librarian to direct to a library
    that does. Because you\u2019re in New York you have access to some great libraries,
    so get out there and ask the librarians to help you look stuff up. You should
    see if the <a href=\"http://tdc.org/\">TDC</a> library has some stuff!\r\n\r\nIf
    you still have trouble, try printing all the good internet articles you can find
    by or about John and showing them to your professor, and pointing out that in
    a field as esoteric as type design, sometimes the internet is a better resource
    than a library. Also, check online articles carefully, sometimes they are reprints
    of articles that appeared in obscure magazines that aren\u2019t in libraries,
    so you can just cite the original magazine."

    Old Style, Vendetta etc), as well as articles <strong>by</strong> John Downer.
    Emigre magazine must have a few of his articles. '

    article for the introduction of his Vendetta type in Emigre No. 50, Spring 1999.
    I don't know if it's also online.
