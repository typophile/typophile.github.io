body: "It's been stated here before, but it has really hit home to me with my experience
  of designing my first font: lowercase and uppercase are really two different animals;
  and figures are a third.\r\n\r\nHistorically they come from three different sources,
  so it shouldn't be a surprise. However, since our reading experience has always
  involved seeing them together, it's easy (as a reader) to overlook their different
  structures. But as a designer it's not: a solution for how to deal with lowercase
  has to be \"translated\" for caps, and then again for numbers. This feat of \"translation\"
  seems to me like one of the more challenging parts of type design."

    runs into. You really have\r\nto allow each case to be itself. And then there's
    the\r\npesky numerals!\r\n\r\nUnless you're reforming things of course. :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
