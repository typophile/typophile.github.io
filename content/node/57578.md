body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI just got put in charge of coming up with a little logo
  for my firm's 120th Anniversary party. Our regular identity font is Avenir Black,
  and I need some suggestions for fonts that would go well with it... particularly
  italics or scripts. Basically, the little logo will either be our standard firm
  name in Avenir Black with \"Celebrating 120 Years\" below that or our firm name
  with \"The Value of Commitment: Celebrating 120 Years.\"\r\n\r\nI've tried searching
  the Typophile archives, but searching for just \"Avenir\" even results in 0 hits,
  so I'm assuming the search function isn't working right now.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJustin"
