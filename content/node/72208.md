    a round corner on the upper left corner? Was it in fact 'HENAY'? But, after not
    too long, I decided that liked the design, and so I made my interpritation."

    is a headline font based on lettering on a plaque of an American forge" but it''s
    actually in Canada. Winnipeg, Manitoba, to be more precise.'

    my interpretation of those glyphs shown as a typeface. For example that upper
    left corner of 'R' makes it too easy to confuse it with 'A'. And 'V' was just
    too narrow to work with other glyphs.\r\n\r\nSo, this is my typeface influenced
    by those very cool characters from Henry Avenue Forge."

  body: "<cite>And how is that lost in the digital interpretation, which to me appears
    stiff and a bit flat?</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree with James on this. It feels too stiff
    and formulaic to me. There are slight variations in the stroke widths, specifically
    on the horizontals, in the sign that aren't there in the digital interpretation.
    This then causes the letterforms to generally have much wider bowls and counters
    in the digitization as a result. I think a more careful observation of the idiosyncrasies
    of the sign would have yielded a more honest & human typeface, rather than one
    that appears to have been made with fontstruct.\r\n\r\nI know you weren't necessarily
    trying to recreate the sign as a typeface, Tomi, and rather to simply use it as
    a springboard for your own exploration. But I think you could have explored a
    bit further, as James said, what it is \"about the original sign that conveys
    the charm that convinced the designer to interpret it.\"\r\n\r\n<em>penn</em>"

  body: "I did notice that most of 'farquarts' comments being rather on the negative
    side.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with both James and Penn; I did not capture those metallic,
    rusty forms, but just made a digital interpretation of the original. But then
    again, that was my intention. I was not looking for accurate reproduction of each
    individual glyphs.\r\n\r\nSteelworks is a font, not a sign. To be true to the
    original, 'V' would look way too thin, and 'W' and 'M' would just look weird,
    and I had to interpolate lots of glyphs. So, some compromises had to be made."

    that tree in vector form, you'll have the same effect as here. There's bevelling,
    shadows, texture, and imperfect alignment in the photo, which can't be replicated
    by a vector font."

  body: "<em>My guess is you don't draw that much type.</em>\r\n\r\nI do; however,
    that doesn't really address anything in the two sentences I wrote. Vector fonts
    cannot replicate real objects: they only mimic. I'm sure if Tomi took his font
    and put it into Photoshop and edited it to make it rusted, textured, etc. it would
    look perfectly fine, but that would defeat the purpose of representing the font
    he's selling, wouldn't it?"

  body: "It's strange that your interpretation removes the qualities that attracted
    you to this lettering, Tomi.\r\nWhy not retain the charming proportions (e.g.
    the squareness of E) and something of the legibilty-challenging idiosyncrasies?\r\nWouldn't
    the design challenge be to resolve that issue, rather than avoid it?\r\nSteelworks
    is a straightforward techno font, nothing wrong with that, but quite apart from
    whether or not it is stiff and a bit flat, and how useful the face may be, you
    have missed an opportunity to do something more informed by the source material
    and more interesting."

    for the design is unspecified. If Steelworks is needed for layouts that include
    images of the Henry Avenue Forge sign or similar signs, then the typeface is successful
    without idiosyncrasies.\r\n\r\nIf it is meant to stand alone and give the impression
    of this sign, then some idiosyncrasies are needed. Blatant errors should not be
    replicated and material textures ought not be represented in the type, but small
    bevels, rounds and curves should carry over. It is important to take advantage
    of your tools by creating what Fonstruct cannot."

    more to the proportions of some of the glyphs, as Nick also mentioned (I think).\r\n\r\n<em>Perhaps
    it is difficult to plan which idiosyncrasies to include when an application for

    much the point I was trying to reach. If I were to approach a project that needed
    the type to look like the original image, I would rather have the actual form
    of the type so that I could make the imperfections/idiosyncrasies myself, as opposed
    to having it pre-done inside of a font.\r\n\r\n<em>Why not retain the charming
    proportions (e.g. the squareness of E) and something of the legibilty-challenging
    idiosyncrasies?</em>\r\n\r\nThis part, although, I do have to agree with. I prefer
    the original \"E\"/\"F\" forms over the current versions."
