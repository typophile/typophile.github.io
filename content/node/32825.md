  body: Goudy? But maybe with a stroke added - as it's heavier than the regular and
    lighter than the bold. I can't find a semi-bold.

  body: "Goudy looks like a good choice Patty. I think adding (or subtracting) stroke
    thickness from either of those would give you an intermediate weight. The outlining
    method also changes the look somewhat.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    like though! Links?

  body: Now I've said that, I've found <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/goudy/t-medium-italic/index.html">this</a>
    that looks like it may be a good match after a bit of stroking...

  body: I think they stroked the regular, rather than using the medium.
