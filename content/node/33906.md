body: "So, we've gotten our upgrade to CS3 and there are many improvements.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  one thing I was looking forward to in the new ID find/change doesn't seem to behave
  as the manual advertises.\r\n\r\nI am using the great new grep tool to find situational
  changes - in this case, a hyphen between numerals, so that I can change the telephone
  numbers' style to period-separation. So far, so good.\r\n\r\nIf I then make the
  change to period, the found numerals surrounding the hyphen are changed too. Not
  so good. Manual says to insert the found text variables there, which is basically
  a stop-change order; I try that, and the actual \"found text\" string, automatically
  inserted by the program, is inserted into the text ($01, $02, etc). Not so good
  either.\r\n\r\nIf anyone here can guide me as to how to correctly use this tool,
  I would be much obliged. An illustration is included so that you can see my mistake."

  body: "Joshua, I understand your pain. Regular expressions (GREP) are a very powerful
    mechanism, but at the same time they're also hard to master.\r\n\r\nThe case you're
    trying to match is actually one of the sample queries InDesign provides. I tried
    it out and it worked like a charm :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID_grep_4823.png]"

  body: "BTW, alternatively to InDesign's provided expression on the \"Find what:\"
    field, you can use this one: <code>(\\d{3})-(\\d{3})-(\\d{4})</code>\r\n\r\nI
    think this one is more intuitive* and does exactly(?) what you want. Translating
    it to English it means:\r\n\u2014 Find a group of 3 digits;\r\n\u2014 followed
    by a hyphen;\r\n\u2014 followed by another group of 3 digits;\r\n\u2014 followed
    by a hyphen;\r\n\u2014 followed by group of 4 digits.\r\n\r\nThen the expression
    in the field \"Change to\" means:\r\n\u2014 What was found in group 1;\r\n\u2014
    follow it by a period;\r\n\u2014 follow it by what was found in group 2;\r\n\u2014
    follow it by a period;\r\n\u2014 follow it by what was found in group 3.\r\n\r\nSimple,
    eh? ;^)\r\n\r\n* The expression that comes with InDesign will match more cases,
    though; it will find and replace occurrences that have a hyphen, a period, a space,
    or nothing, between the groups of digits."

  body: "As far as I've seen, all the US phone numbers follow the format 3-3-4, but
    what if that's not always true? Then you can use this expression: <code>(\\d+)-(\\d+)-(\\d+)</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    plus sign (+) means \"Find one or more of the previous\". So in this case it's
    matching one or more digits.\r\n\r\n(I'll stop now :^)"

    use this feature. Comparing the two I see that the CS3 version does not have the
    option \"Create New Document\", which is what you're asking about, I believe.
    I don't know why that change was made.\r\n\r\nWas the ability to have your InDesign
    document in an imposed form an important feature for you? I assume you'd use such
    files just for printing, and that all the changes/corrections would be made in
    the original version, no? If so, then the lost of functionality is not that big,
    IMO."

    with CS2 and not upgrade until a plugin that handles this is available (although
