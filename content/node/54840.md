  at a poster for this movie while waiting for the subway, and was struck by the odd
  lowercase g, y and the slightly-off serifs on the cap C and S. Identifont and Whatthefont
  weren't much help, but I did learn that those lowercase oddities suggest a Vibert-influenced
  Didot. The closest I can find is [[http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Ambroise|Ambroise]],
  but there are some definite differences (t, K, and j to name a few). \r\n\r\nAny
  clues? Is this perhaps a custom mash-up of Didones?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\u2014Noam\r\n\r\n"

    but the lc s is not the same. I'll keep checking ...

      all.

  body: "Is it? I don' see it in the PDF specimen. It's not just the s. The cap K
    and lc k, f in Ambroise are funky in ways that this poster is not. The lc t has
    a different top, the Ambroise cap G has a downward-pointing spur, and all the
    ball terminals in the poster feel a tad more lachrymal than your average Didone.
    I'm going to try getting a photo of the poster next time I take the train.\r\n\r\n\u2014Noam"

  body: "@Cubic_DS, good call! Didot Elder accounts for those arrowhead serifs on
    the cap C and S. However, in the poster the lc s has lachrymal terminals on both
    ends, instead of an arrowhead at the top. I'm guessing the lc s is an alternate
    glyph. Thanks for the help, folks!\r\n\r\n\u2014Noam"
