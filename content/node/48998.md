  body: Not sure which symbol you're looking for. Is it one of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/linotype_audio_pi_std_regular/">these</a>?
    Any reason it has to be T1?

  body: There was also a font called 'Rainbow' filled with symbols pertaining to audio,
    records, copyright and such. I remember using it back in the nineties, and I have
    no idea who made it. It might come from a CD stamper plant or a record label.

    symbols below would be just fine;\r\nhttp://crystalcaisse.com/images/audio_symbol_white.gif\r\nhttp://www.iconspedia.com/uploads/536223819.png\r\n(or
    just only that 'play' triangle)\r\n\r\nI prefer T1 (perhaps a ttf might work)
    because I'm doing this project in 'good old' Corel Ventura. And this magnificent
    programm can be quite picky when it comes to exotic otf.\r\nThanks guys, Brieck "

    was \u2013 for obivious reasons \u2013 not an option for book design and Indesign
    didin't exist yet \u2013 for years. \r\n\r\nEver worked with Ventura Stephan?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the links, both, much appreciated, Brieck."

  body: "G\xFCnni, I picked the mac-dingbats. Thanks. I've searched dafont.com for
    a video symbol as well. Harder to define; is there like a global video symbol?
    Sure, Mac has its QT etcetera. \r\nGot an idea?"

  body: "The problem with the free font sites is that a lot of their fonts, especially
    the dingbats, are autotraced and look odd in certain sizes. I\u2019m sure you
    know this already, nevertheless I wanted to warn you :) Didn\u2019t check the
    MacDingbats, though.\r\n\r\nCan\u2019t think of a universal video symbol right
    know, but how about an eye symbol?\r\nAnd an ear for audio?"

    the bowed rectangle that looks like a TV screen (from the days before flat-screen);
    like the one two from the left and three down on the link Stephen Coles first
    posted above."
