    stroke? I don't know how big you need it, but way back when I worked at Kinko's
    we had a 36\" wide black and white banner printer that could enlarge black and
    white printouts for fairly cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Fontlab can just print the outlines at a good size using the "glyph sample"
    print option. You can probably even do it with the demo version.
