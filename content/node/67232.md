  [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/sommet/fonts/|Sommet family]] of typefaces has been
  updated with a new slab serif variant.\r\n\r\nExpanding on Sommet\u2019s successful
  design principals, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sommet-slab/|Sommet Slab]]
  is there when you need more impact and power.\r\nSommet Slab is available with six
  weights and complementary italics and plenty of OpenType features. Sommet Slab features
  a tall x-height, and its letterforms are compact, perfect for when layout space
  is at a premium. Over twenty OpenType alternate characters are available, including
  friendlier upright italic forms, and a unique simplified lowercase. Sommet Slab
  also includes oldstyle figures and small caps.\r\n\r\nUse Sommet Slab whenever you
  need a powerful and contemporary slab-serif.\r\n\r\n"
