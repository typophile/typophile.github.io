  body: "Ah, okay.\r\nSomeone must have customized it, see the two-storey \u2018a\u2019
    (completely inappropriate, if you ask me):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_4146.png]\r\nMaybe
    they did it in order to harmonize the \u2018a\u2019 with the \u2018\xE6\u2019.
    And they might have changed the \u2018\xE6\u2019 in the first place, because that
    really <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/hermes/?sample_text=\xE6&sample_size=144\">is
    kinda quirky in the original Hermes</a>. Nothing but presumptions. ;-)"
