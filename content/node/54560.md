  body: "I like the idea of imprinting a design on eggshells, frivolous though it
    may be. (I wonder how they do it? An impact type of printing would break the eggs,
    so maybe it's some kind of inkjet.) \r\nBut why would you print Disney cartoon
    characters on something you would never let preschool children play with--raw
    eggs?"
