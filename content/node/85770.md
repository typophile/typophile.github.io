body: "I'm helping my husband re-work the logo for his landscaping business.  He's
  used this logo on his trucks, business cards, collateral, etc before, but due to
  a computer crash, we've lost the font names and I can't seem to find them.  Any
  help is much appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/tshirt_4646.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  most interested in finding the name of the Celtic/Gaelic looking font. But if you
  know the one for \"C.B. McAuley\" too, that'd be great!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: Another view of the font - we prefer the "C.B. McAuley" on this truck - which
    appears to be a different font than on the other file.  Please help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/truck
