body: I know it's a really small sample but it's all I've been given. Sorry. Client
  wants me to match the font "pretty acurately" - the "2" looks strange. I think the
  small radiused corners are from a bad screenprinting job rather than by design.
  Thanks in advance for any thoughts.

  body: I looked at that Mike... and yes, it's kinda close, but the terminals on the
    "3" are perfectly horizontal on the saample. I suspect it's something that someone
    has mangled and tortured. I was thinking that it might have been originally a
    condensed black of some font that has been super s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d (hence the
    weird weight differences). But thanks anyway!

    target=\"new\">Avant Garde Gothic Bold</a> has a 2 and 3 that match even better
    than my previous pick (not the 1 however). Strangely, the '3' proportions changed
    to be more symmetrical at that weight -- something I hadn't noticed before in
    Avant Garde.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

      the Akzidenz is as close as we're going to get. No accounting for bad taste
      huh? Thanks for being able to pick your brain though. Have a good one!"
