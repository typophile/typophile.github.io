  body: "Franklin Gothic & other bold sans (Brokeback Mountain, Firewall, Syriana)
    seem to be vying with Trajan as font du jour on the movie posters these days,
    altho Trajan is putting up a good fight (Geisha, Tristram Shandy, Final Destination).\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I agree it's all wrong for Tristan & Isolde."
