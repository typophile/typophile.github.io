body: "Is there a way to keep unicode when I append a glyph? I drew a roman font and
  all unicode and naming work well. Now I want to draw the italic one. So, I start
  from an italic vbf file I've already drew as a basic file and I want to import the
  new glyph I've inserted in the roman one. When I import it I lost the unicode name.
  Is some typophile user has a solution to append a glyph without lost the unicode
  number? I hope the problem description is clear enough.\r\nThanks."

    glyphs window target. The glyph copied is imported without the unicode name. I
    will try your suggestion. Thanks

    Fontlab: if your target file is set to Unicode, and your copy (from file) is set
    to Names, then if you copy and paste to the correct Unicode position in the target
    file, everything works  fine."
