body: "I would love to get some weigh-in regarding the conversion of fonts across
  platforms. We have a little experience in this realm, but we are running into problems.
  We have a large office of creative contributors, both the PC and Mac platforms are
  represented here so because there is so much back and forth with files including
  the fonts, we have decided to install Extensis Universal Type Server so we can all
  be on the same page.\r\n\r\nWe have opted to convert everything to Opentype Postscript
  (.OTF) because, from the tests that we have done, the file size is considerably
  smaller. But frequently what's happening is that characters, glyphs or ligatures
  are not displaying in a variety of applications across platforms.  There doesn't
  appear to be a pattern to it, but when we convert the font to OpenType TrueType
  (.TTF) the problems seem to be diffused.\r\n\r\nThe main question we have is; If
  we convert some fonts to TrueType does that disable any of the advanced OpenType
  features in the font itself?  I have my assumptions, but i wanted to open it up
  for your input. \r\n\r\nYour help is appreciated, we are currently converting thousands
  of fonts (all above board) and would love to have this done right.\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

    of applications across platforms\", have you looked into which OT capabilities
    Windows based apps have vs. Macs. Some Windows apps are different than Mac versions.
    Ligature substitution shouldn't be problem in either flavor of OT, but other features
    vary a lot when it comes to OT capabilities.\r\n\r\nI'm especially interested
    in responses you get as I will soon be involved in a similar assignment. I work
    in a very large creative studio that is about to undergo major upgrades. We are
    migrating from Freehand as our layout app to Adobe CS4. We will also be migrating
    our Font Reserve Server to Universal Type Server. I will be responsible for most
    of that and converting our proprietary font collection to OT format. I won't be
    converting our general font collection as these will need to be repurchased. I
    will have to do fixes though, till new licenses are attained. UTS I'm told will
    automatically purge corrupt or orphaned PS fonts."

  body: "Yes, we're testing the same applications across platforms (Flash, Indesign,
    Illustrator and Word), so the opentype capabilities appear to be fairly consistent
    across platform.\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"other features vary a lot when it comes
    to OT capabilities,\" do you mean from application to application, or OTF vs.
    TTF? And if it is OTF vs. TTF, would you be able to explain?\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your response."

    we could find to do so. Also, Stephen, thank you for your input.

  body: Hi Sii, yes, that is happening now. But it appears to happen less or not at
    all when converting to TTF. I just wonder if we're losing in the long run by not
    converting to OTF (i.e., losing advanced font features that aren't available when
    using TTF).

    OTF. However, a wrong or sloppy conversion could potentially destroy the features.
    So only do it if you know what you are doing, or repurchase some fonts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "OK, maybe to put some people's mind at ease: There is absolutely nothing
    wrong with doing OT TTF, nada, njet, zilch. Larger file sizes are not really an
    issue, they should only differ by a few k. If it is very much more, then the TTF
    fonts are hinted!\r\n\r\nDalton Maag produces all its fonts in TTF format because
    they work reliably. We have never had any issues with TTF. This is particularly
    true for anything outside the standard ANSII char set.\r\n\r\nOTF (CFF) fonts
    did have some problems with older apps in dealing with Central European characters,
    and other non-Latins. The reason is that in TTF all glyphs map straight to Unicode,
    whilst with CFF you still have, in essence, a PostScript font based on glyph names,
    padded with a huge wrapper that makes it OT. The glyph names then point to Unicode.
    So, if your font hasn't got a clean glyph name table it won't point correctly
    to Unicode and it won't either display correctly or print. As it is, in essence,
    still all based on glyph names, the conversion tables in your printer drivers
    have to be fully compliant with your glyphs names in the font, otherwise they
    won't be recognised.\r\n\r\nYou may have found that when loading a TTF into MacOSX
    with FontBook you get a warning not to install the font as it is corrupted and
    will explode your system, followed by complete annihilation of the area you live
    in. This is due to a 'bug' in Fontbook that demands there is a 'fpgm' table present
    in all TTF fonts. This table is only needed if the font has been hinted. You can
    ignore the warning. Your font will work and life will go on.\r\n\r\nPhew, that
    was a rant. Again, use TTF. It works, there is no downside. \r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton
