body: "Hi all, I'm looking for some advice on choosing a body copy typeface...\r\n\r\nI'm
  designing a logo for a client based on the hebridean isles off the west coast of
  Scotland, currently in the concept stage and not far from presenting these back
  to her. The logo is part of an identity job relating to a bespoke tartan which has
  been commissioned, and will be sold through gift shops.\r\n\r\nThe hebrides and
  west coast of Scotland have strong ties to Ireland going back to the days of St
  Columba, who founded his famous abbey on the island of Iona:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrides\r\n\r\nThe
  client has expressed a wish for me to include a calligraphic, manuscript looking
  face like Ophelia (https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/ophelia), Omnia (https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=OMNQ10005000)
  or Carolus Magnus (https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-carolus-magnus/)\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I'm finding it hard to pair these blackletter/uncial faces with a legible body face
  for extended pieces of copy whilst keeping the same feel. Can anyone suggest anything
  which might be suitable?\r\n\r\nThanks, Lee"

    on constrains and design choices.\r\nThere are faces suitable for body text with
    more or less subtle references to celtic/uncial/insular styles.\r\nThe questions
    I think one should answer in order to narrow the search could be:\r\n- There need
    to be just one typeface, or there could be two (one more calligraphic for headers
    and such, and a \"tamed\" one for texts)?\r\n- How long would texts be (longer
    text = tamer typeface)?\r\n- There will be need of emphasis inside the texts?
    And, if so, it should be expressed with italics or it could be other means (darker
    weight, colour, a different style)?\r\n- As always, expected language coverage
    should be taken into account.\r\n\r\nA couple of typefaces that could fit the
    bill, devoid of any historical or stylistic accuracy (found looking for \"uncial
    text\"):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/farfa/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/delve/rieven-uncial-pro/\r\n\r\nFor
    a more modern take, SIAS' Hibernica could be an interesting choice. Perhaps paired
    with its elder sister Lapidaria for a wider range of styles and permutations:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/hibernica/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/"

  body: "Farfa looks like a reasonable choice for body copy.\r\n\r\nIf, however, by
    \"legible\", one means a <em>conventional</em> body type, with only a nod in the
    direction of keeping the same feel, maybe a Jenson of some sort is what is sought.
    Centaur, for example, might be considered.\r\n\r\nA conventional roman that just
    nods a little bit in the direction of the calligraphic... I can't think of one
    offhand. That is, I can't think of one that nods just a little bit <em>more</em>
    than Hermann Zapf's Palatino.\r\n\r\nOr a calligraphic typeface that is still
    <em>very</em> close to a conventional Roman - also something I've been looking
    for, and have not encountered.\r\n\r\nThere is Goudy Thirty, but while I'm definitely
    <strong>not</strong> going to recommend that, there could be something like that
    in Goudy's \u0153uvre.\r\n\r\nLooking for one, I came across \"Goudy Newstyle\",
    but that was apparently made for a Shaw Alphabet-style project, although it looks
    like a conventional typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Goudy_Newstyle_r_4421.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Hey,
    looking at the p and q, and to a lesser extent, the b and d, this could be pitched
    as a font for dyslexics!)\r\n\r\nAmazingly enough, it <em>is</em> available in
    digital form - or it was; the links I've turned up to fonts by Red Rooster and
    Richard Beatty are coming up dry.\r\n\r\nHowever, I <em>was</em> able to find
    [[https://www.fontshop.com/families/jenson-eusebius-new-style|Jenson Eusebius
    New Style]], which I think is even better."

  body: "It\u2019s OK to use a newer face for body.\r\nBack in the day, the principle
    was to use progressively newer lettering styles as one proceeded down the hierarchy
    of type size, on the manuscript page.\r\n\r\nI recommend two of my neo-incunabula
    styles, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/paradigm/webfont_preview.html\">Paradigm</a>
    and <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/goodchild/webfont_preview.html\">Goodchild</a>.\r\nParadigm,
    loosely inspired by Ratdolt\u2019s work, has a kind of built-in distress parsing
    the effect of letterpress, or looking like it was done with a calligraphic pen
    at the small size limit of its ability.\r\nGoodchild is a robust Venetian, a Jenson
    revival, with a large x-height.\r\nSo both styles will hold up very small.\r\n\r\n(For
    a fuller-featured Goodchild, please contact me directly.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
