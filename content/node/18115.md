  body: 'Keep in mind, if the fonts are standard Mac TrueType or Postscript, they
    will not work with Windows. In addition the fonts will likely have their resource
    forks removed if they are on a Windows box. I mention this, because if they were
    OpenType or TrueType, they wouldn''t have needed to be stuffed in the first place. '
