  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Generally, I'm interested in typography. Professionally, I'm a software programmer. Privately, I am, among (a few) other things, a lover of design with typography near the top of the list of favorite design disciplines. I'd been searching for a specific book for the better part of a year, when a friend suggested I look for a forum discussing typography to ask experts and enthusiasts my question:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is there such a book (or, hopefully, books) which look at:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- How cultural, social, economic, political trends have impacted the use of existing typefaces and design of new typefaces, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Conversely, how uses of existing and new typefaces have, through the course of history, affected communication and expression, and impacted greater cultural, social, economic, political trends? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My interest is pretty broad: a historical account, a contemporary analysis, theory. I'd be interested in a couple of other related topics, such as the crosstalk between typography and other design disciplines, or at what time and in which contexts were specific design elements and forms in specific glyphs or whole typefaces introduced.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A rather broad description. Any hits in the vicinity would be appreciated, as is your patience to simply read this post.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Much thanks,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->KLS</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's another: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Visible Word : Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923, by Johanna Drucker <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was reminded of it by Armin's post &ndash; like Heller, Drucker attaches great importance to the publications of early 20th C art movements. She also argues that the integration of text into (some) modern art which occurred at that time subsequently went missing, with the unfortunate result that Post WW2 modernism, especially the NY school, slipped into a polarized void, with critics supplying all the words, and the art becoming a dumb, shallow,  conceptual second fiddle.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, that's how I remember the book from reading it a few years ago, so she might actually have said something quite different.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">K.Lo &ndash; I'm not saying a book doesn't exist for your topic. But I will say that it sounds like you have a great idea for a potential thesis. &ndash; I'm not sure you will find a book with your wishes directly. I might start by finding books with excellent bibliographies and branch out in those directions. I think you will find that you are going to have to form many of the connections on your own.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wonder if you might find something or someone from the University of Reading &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/">http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; that might share your interests, Simon Eliot has done research involving economics and the history of printing. He might be a good lead. Dig around their site, they list all of the staff's research in bibliographic form.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll keep my eyes open. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a side note &quot;Typography Papers 5&quot; has been released. If ever there were five publications necessary to a serious typophile (with interests too broad to saddle) it would be these. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
