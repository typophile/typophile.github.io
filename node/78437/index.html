  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I'm taking over our Yearbook next year here at Newbury Park High School. I know it's early, but I'm working on mockups for next year because I'm reorganizing the whole thing. Currently we have a theme and each editor for each section applies that theme in their own method. This year it's digitized. I know. TERRIBLE. So next year, we're having a standard design. My co-editor Shanti and I have basic layouts done, but we're looking for the perfect fonts. We're a school, so we don't have a large budget for fonts. We need a title font (or as many as you want to name) and a body font. What has kept us stuck is pairing the two. Any ideas? Much Love, Christoph & Shanti!</div>

Not sure if you're using "theme" to mean a visual look, or something more in the editorial/philosophical sense. But if you're concerned that the sections will look unrelated, one way to add some visual harmony is to create a selection of fonts and colors, and then ask each editor to pick and choose what they want from those groups. Each editor retains some creative freedom and can lay out the pages in their section as they wish, but the common elements add some overall harmony.</div>

James, I'll have to remember that. That sounds really good actually as not seeming so "this is how it is" and authoritarian and stuff. Thank you as well, Mr. M.</div>

Yeah, if you give people a nice range of choices it doesn't seem as constraining to them. 

Just be sure that the choices go together reasonably well; for example choose a palette of colors that work together well rather than a bunch of random colors. (That's something your art teacher could help you with if you're not knowledeable about color theory.)

Another approach that's even looser is to specify one font family and 1 color (maybe a school color) that each editor must use somewhere on their pages, but they are free to also add any other fonts or colors. The result would be less harmonious than my previous suggestion, but would create a least a little bit of relationship between sections.</div>
