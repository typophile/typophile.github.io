  find/change feature. I'm trying to do a find/change on the section numbers of a
  document, and so far, I've only been able to get it to change \r\none number.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/31_6638.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  using ^9.(space) to find all instances of numbers, but it seems to only change one
  of the numbers to the new style I want to apply.\r\n\r\nAny secrets? Thanks in advance\u2026\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The wildcard <strong>^9</strong> only matches one digit. So for numbers composed
    of more than one digit, you'll have to use the wildcard more than once.\r\n\r\nIn
    your example, you'll have to do two Find/Change operations; one with the pattern
    you've used, and another with this pattern: <strong>^9^9.(space)</strong>\r\n\r\nFor

    find new ways to have my computer do the tedious work for me. This InDesignSecrets
    website looks interesting, gonna check it in depth.

    and with it I learned some things I didn't know about. Here are two:\r\n\r\n<strong>Delete
    Preference Files</strong>\r\nYou can delete InDesign's preference files when launching
    InDesign. To display this option dialog, launch InDesign, then immediately select
    Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) or Ctrl+Option+Command+Shift (Mac OS).\r\n<em>Eliot Harper,
    from InDesign Magazine Issue #7</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Zoom-sensitive Ruler Guides</strong>\r\nHold
    down the Option key (Mac) or Alt key (Windows) while dragging out a ruler guide
    to make it visible only at the current zoom level and larger. If you zoom out,
    the guide will disappear. When you zoom back to the previous magnification or
    above, the ruler guide will reappear.\r\n<em>Keith Gilbert, from InDesign Magazine
    #7</em>\r\n\r\nI'm also a subscriber of the <a href=\"http://www.indesignmag.com/idm/issues.html\">ID
    Mag</a> itself. It is quite good, for both beginner and advanced users. Unfortunately,
    I don't have enough time available to read it all (60+ pages!!), so I end up not
    taking full advantage of it :^("

    Scripting forum</a> at Adobe. F/C routines are a simple thing to script, and there's
    really no reason not to if you'll be doing this often. if you have trouble finding
    a sample that works, contact me and I'll dig up a sample to send you (assuming
    you're working on Mac).

  body: No, I want to ad a tab. It's replacing the numbers in my list WITH the wildcard,
    which is supposed to just be a numeral placeholder. ^9 is the wildcard for 'any
    number' It 'should' find a single number and add a tab.

  body: Did you assign the Section Numbers with a character style? If you do that
    then you can easily do a find/change to replace them.
