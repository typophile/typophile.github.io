body: "The combined structure and style of a letter or [[glyph]], its physical form.
  Basic Latin letterforms consist of the letters a to z, and A to Z, and the Arabic/Indian
  [[numerals]] 0 (zero) to 9. Letterform is analogous to letter structure.\r\n\r\nLetterforms
  are represented by sub-types. For example, capital Latin A letterform is a triangular
  structure mirrored by its gothic counterpart letterform, the straight-sided loop
  top A. In [[roman]] types, the  triangular lowercase [[v]] letterform has an alternate
  cursive v letterform. Each is treated as a ditinct letter form or structure."
