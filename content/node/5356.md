  body: 'This is great news, Fabrizio. I for one will certainly buy a copy of your
    book &#40;by the way, is it already available in Italian bookstores?&#41;. <BR>I
    didn&#39;t have the time to read carefully the PDF yet, but it seems very interesting.
    <BR>One thing I am very curious about is this: Italian typographic and editorial
    rules have many differences from other countries&#39; styles: I am wondering if
    this is stressed often enough in the English version of your book &#40;but I am
    pretty sure it is&#41;. <BR>As one of the few Italian designers who browse the
    Typophile forums, may I suggest to to edit the title of your post and possibly
    add an English translation, too? I am afraid very few people here are fluent with
    the Italian language, and it would be a pity if most people woud skip your post,
    especially considering your book offers a bi-lingual text. <BR>Looking forward
    to read your book! <BR>Ciao <BR> <BR>Paolo Colonna'
