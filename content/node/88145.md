  and I charge $25 for the commercial license fee.\r\n\r\nI received an email from
  someone wanting to create an embroidery version of my font and sell it on Etsy.
  I am not familiar with Etsy, and both the website itself and Google is unusually
  useless. What, if anything should I charge for commission?"

    arts and crafts for sale. Asking what to charge is impossible for us to answer.
    It depends on way too many variables, not the least of which is your own opinion.
    \r\n\r\nThat said, it's typical for most font licenses to have a clause that if
    one is primarily selling the typeface as the product, that the standard license
    doesn't apply. So you'd certainly be in the norm asking for a custom license for
    this use. "

    (don't know what, as she hasn't said what she planned on charging) from every
    sale. If the third party wishes to use the embroidery font for commercial reasons,
    I'd like there to be contact information so they can pay me the remainder of the
    license fee.\r\n\r\nWould that be too much? Or should I just forbid commercial
    use on the third party's part whatsover?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If the font is being embedded in an embroidery application that will be resold
    and loaded into computerized sewing machines, you could charge a flat license
    fee, which would eliminate a lot of royalty \u201Cpaperwork\u201D. But you would
    need to have some idea of projected sales.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not much different
    than licensing a font for use in an app for digital devices that output to a screen,
    only this outputs to fabric."
