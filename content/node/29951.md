body: Does anyone know where I can find any Tshirts that are (how do I say it) Type
  sensitive. For Example If a typographer or Hand Letter did a line of Tshirts this
  is where I would go. I know Ken Barber has a line House 33 but can't find anywhere
  to buy it. I tried his site but looks unfinished. I have also seen a shirt that
  has KERN on it but no clue where it is either. Thanks

    Susan Kare's website has a number of <a href=\"http://www.kare.com/shop.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">t-shirt designs</a> -- some of them are the original Macintosh
    black and white icons, like the dogcow (\"MOOF!\"), and some are the color icons
    she did for Windows. All of 'em have that retro bitmap charm.\r\n\r\nThen there's
    the tee that Khoi Vihn made <a href=\"http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/0719_coming_soon_.php\"
    target=\"_blank\">combining Helvetica and Fette Fraktur</a>...\r\n\r\nFontShop
    had some really nice t-shirts at the San Francisco TypeCon... They said things
    like <strong>Your Type</strong> and <strong>Semi Bold</strong> in the familiar
    yellow-and-black logo, using various FF faces... I'm sure they were only meant
    for the conference, but it would be nice if they were still for sale somewhere
    (hint hint!)... On the other hand, a quick Google search led me to a treasure
    trove of t-shirts from various foundries over at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com.au/tshirtsc.php3?sns=3&fsausess=9047652d6c1429859791615cd5073f94\"
