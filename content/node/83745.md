  \r\n\r\nI came across some typefaces and I really want to use them but I can't quite
  identify them. Maybe you guys can help. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/il_570xN_3714.149038042.jpg]\r\nThe
  Clover Farm portion in this picture is what I'm particularly interested in\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/home_5345.jpg]\r\nI
  love the way the crotch(Giggity) of the letter M in gold is made with the twist!!!"

  body: I still haven't found a font that contorts the letter M like the image above.
    Does anyone know the typeface used in the second image? I checked letterheadfonts
    also.

    a similar design.

  body: "Thanks Atwe! That one is really nice.\r\n\r\nI found another item that uses
    the similar style (particularly the M) that I'm looking for. I want to say it's
    Egyptian or a 1800s type. I'm not sure. What do you guys think?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wpid-nike-lebron-9-mvp-shoe-bag_5705.jpg]"

  body: The book with the golden letters on its cover is from 1878 (see [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mamluke/2080253327/|here]]),
    so it is certainly not digital type.

  body: Well, you said the "M in gold", so I thought you meant the lower M. Then you
    showed the hat, which has an M like the upper one in your original image. Assuming,
    then, that you like the geometric M like on the hat, do a Web search for the font
    'Ringlet' - a digital version of a Victorian era typeface.
