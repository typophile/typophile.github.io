  varying text sizes, thicknesses. but dont end up looking a mess! Or perhaps know
  of some good examples or tutorials for this, that I could check out\r\n\r\nI realise
  this could be a fairly broad typesetting question, but I'm sure there are some tips
  and tricks to do with grid layouts or and baseline shifting that I'm missing. I
  have loads of these to get through and currently they are taking hours to do...\r\n\r\nI
  have inserted a truly bad example of what I mean, this using Photoshop's paragraph
  text.\r\nUsing a basic Helvetica set (regular, bold, light), I then went in and
  simply adjusted font sizes on certain words, which in turn messes up the spacing
  between lines, so I started to adjust the leading for each line but this is done
  by eye and not very satisfactory. Is eyeballing it the only way??!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextHash_3665.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  help on this would be greatly appreciated, I like having hair!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEugene"

    more than one ways to go about this, but generally it doesn't look very nice.
    \r\n\r\n\u2022 I used a line height (leading) that would work with the largest
    point size. \r\n\u2022 Then I typed in everything in a smaller point sized without
    changing the line height, changed the size of the words decided and used baseline
    shift to center them on the line. \r\n\u2022 I picked a typeface with old style
    numerals to avoid them sticking out. \r\n\u2022 % is to tall, but I'll leave that
    to you to figure out.\r\n\u2022 I used the bold weight with small text to match
    the words weight better.\r\n"

  body: "Your design premise is flawed. \r\n\r\nIf you want to do mix and match, you
    should stick to the same type size, and vary type style, or completely \"eyeball\"
    much shorter sentences--where realistically the best technique is to put each
    word (or small group of two or three words) in a separate box and drag and size."

  body: A little off topic but, Why are you using Photoshop for text?

  body: "Hi, Thanks for all your commments and help, esp frode frank for taking the
    time to show an example of how to approach type layout, with varying sizes. Video
    is done now and just keeping consistent line height, shifting just the baseline
    on larger words did the trick, so simple and obvious really!\r\n\r\nI use photoshop
    for text as I rarely need to create large blocks of text in video, and also it
    is going straight into Aftereffects where you can edit photoshop text if need
    be (without rasterizing), and apply animation and effects to portions of the text
    etc..\r\n\r\nI was going to ask if there is a baseline grid in photoshop then
    I found this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thegridsystem.org/2008/templates/photoshop-975px-grid-system-12/\r\n\r\ncould
    be handy to some people at typophile?\r\n\r\nSo what is the choice app for doing
    text layouts after all? The graphic guys here reckon its illustrator? if so why?!\r\n\r\nCool,
    Thanks again,\r\nEugene\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: It depends on the use. Text handling is generally done in InDesign, while
    Illustrator handles tweaking and adjusting.
