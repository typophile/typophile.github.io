  use a particular font that I've seen before (or at least similar-looking fonts),
  but I can't seem to identify it.\r\n\r\nIt consists of blocky, solid letters with
  geometric forms... the upper-case \"C\" looks exactly like Pacman, i.e. a pie with
  a piece missing\r\n\r\nI've attached two images:\r\n1) a screenshot of the website
  with the font in question\r\n2) a screenshot of 'Black Boton Bold', which came up
  on Identifont, and is similar but not quite the same\r\n\r\n<b>Does anybody know
  this font?</b> And are there any similar, free versions of this type of fontface
  floating around?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
