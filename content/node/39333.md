  in the German language.\r\nIn English it seems straight forward enough:\r\n\r\n5\u201321
  September 2008 (close-set en dash)\r\n\r\nin German:\r\n\r\n5. - 21. September 2008
  (what kind of dash, spaces or no spaces?)\r\nalso, is it okay to abbreviate the
  year to 08? if so, does one add the apostrophe? '08\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated
  \r\n\r\nSeb"

    for \"to\" (as in \"from ... to ...\").\r\n\r\nAbbreviating to 08 is possible
    but I personally feel it looks a bit inappropriate if you spell out September.
    '08 can also be found in German but to me it looks a bit outdated, typically 70s
    style."
