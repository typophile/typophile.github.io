  to know the name of the font for Campbells, but if you could name the rest of the
  fonts from the can it would be nice too. Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/campbells2_4628.png]'

  body: This is lettering. I'm unsure about 'Condensed' and 'Chicken Noodle'. I'm

    fonts.The sans could be pretty close to different weights/widths of Futura.\r\n\r\n-
