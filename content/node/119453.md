    by Bob Newman [Letraset, Linotype] looks somewhat close but the /R is totally
    off"

  body: "ArtDeco fonts are so easy to make and so abundant, it's not surprising we
    did not find this exact one. For a well made Art Deco, with your _R_, I suggest
    Mark Simonson's Mostra Nuova http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/\r\nNote
    that it has your demi _C_ and something close to your _M_ as alt letters. I you
    want an exact match, Mostra Nuova can yield it with just a little tinkering.\r\nDon"

    also want to present [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/harry-pro/|Harry

    Harry has the better R."
