  unveiling of our new athletic uniforms. The video shows brief glimpses of closeup
  details of the new uniforms. Here is a screengrab showing only the letters \"M I
  Z\"  ...Can anyone help me identify the font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05-sm_5462.jpg]\r\n\r\nand,
  it looks like it could be the same font used at the beginning of the video:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4-14-12-sm_6013.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKampy\r\n\r\nhttp://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g230/Kampy1971/05.png\r\n\r\nP.S.
