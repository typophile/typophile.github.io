  body: "The basis is definitely a geometrical sans-serif, where the G is part of
    a circle. More like Futura than Avant Garde, while the M is more Avant Garde.
    Haven't seen a weight that ultra-bold with either. And you can easily build these
    few characters from simple geometrical forms, that's why I assumed \"inspired
    by\". Logos are often not made from a typeface. And definitely not Avenir.\r\n\r\nAndreas"
