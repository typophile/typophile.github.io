  it will probably look a bit crude. It&#39;s still in FreeHand at the moment while
  I read up on Fontographer.  <BR> <BR>I started off trying to make a more readable
  alternative to display typefaces like Sharp. I then amended the idea to include
  designing for dyslexics &#40;avoiding the double-storey &#39;a&#39;, making the
  &#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39; and &#39;o&#39; very different and making &#39;b&#39;/&#39;d&#39;
  and &#39;p&#39;/&#39;q&#39; characters that don&#39;t mirror each other&#41;. This
  was sparked by articles in Creative Review on alternatives to Comic Sans that are
  readable for dyslexics &#40;like Lexia - <a href="http://www.k-type.com" target="_blank">www.k-type.com</a>&#41;
  and the Read Regular font by Natascha Frensch &#40;<a href="http://www.readregular.com"
  target="_blank">www.readregular.com</a>&#41;. <BR> <BR>I realise the ascenders of
  my typeface may not be tall enough for dyslexics but wanted to get some feedback
  anyway. I especially wanted to know if there&#39;s anything similar to this already
  out there?  <BR> <BR><!--attachment: talon_draft3-64127.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*9.6*Talon+specimen*talon_draft3%2epdf

  body: I think that design for dyslexia is quite interesting, and that this design
    can become interesting, but the two don&#39;t mix, basically because this is very
    firmly in the display realm, and dyslexia is about reading. <BR> <BR>You can use
    science &#40;or at least analysis&#41; to make <i>any</i> font more legible or
    readable, but I think if you want to focus on such a singular &#34;disorder&#34;
    a texty design would have to to be the target. <BR> <BR>&#40;That took about 2
    minutes - not too bad a redistribution of <BR>time/efficiency if it might end
    up saving Derek a few hours, eh?&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I agree with Hrant; this is like an expanded ultra-black, and would not work
    at all in a text setting. It wouldn&#39;t even be that legible in a display setting,
    although I suppose it would be more legible than usual for dyslexics. This might
    be interesting if you treat it as a blackweight alternative to a much lighter
    regular textface, but if readability is your goal, you&#39;re probably going to
    need to play with serifs of some kind as well. <BR> <BR>On another note, has Natascha
    ever released Read Regular? It&#39;s a neat idea, and someday I&#39;d like to
    actually play with it.

  body: 'I take both your points. I think because I started this as a display face
    then thought about dyslexic issues later it will always be a secondary thing,
    not the main reason behind the design. I was going to take the dyslexia part out
    of the title of this post &#40;and attach a proper PDF!&#41; but didn&#39;t know
    how. <BR> <BR>I have started a sans serif face much more aimed at helping dyslexics
    so I think I will put those efforts into that design instead. Is it worth doing
    more work on this typeface or are there already faces like this available? <BR>
    <BR>&#40;PS: Read Regular still doesn&#39;t seem to be commercially available,
    unfortunately.&#41;'
