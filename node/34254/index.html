<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi I accidentally found <a href=http://typophile.com/node/32397>this article</a> (and many others following) while searching other typographic related stuff over your forums, and I was suddenly shocked by the general misunderstandings that westerner people have about [[Cyrillic]] language and alphabet, so I’ve updated the sections of your site concerning the disputed language and writing system. I found it very non-polite and offending that a group of people professionally involved in typography, which I may consider for high educated, have so little knowledge about a culture, for which they actually are trying to produce typefaces.
And two more remarks:
I’m not trying to produce a cultural scandal…
Don’t actually believe all those Russian authors, cited in your posts – do not forget that, in the time of our little (45 years) of Russian occupation of Bulgaria, a rumor was widely spread that the actual developers of Cyrillic alphabet were from Russian origins….
Kind Regards,
Kateliev
PS: in the coming weeks,when i have time, i'll try to upload some works of famous Bulgarian typographers that are worth mentioning </div>

<div class=commentbody>> Don’t actually believe all those Russian authors ...
I don't get it, is it us westerners who are the problem, or is
it simply anybody who disagrees with your personal views?
Participation, especially from "natives", is always highly valued, and whenever there really is something wrong with what we believe we're generally gracious and wise enough to admit/fix it. But pretending a single person knows The Truth is laughable. So please do upload anything you'd like (especially concerning Eastern European typography, which doesn't get enough coverage) but don't get too angry if some people think your views are incorrect.

<div class=commentbody>Sorry hrant, but now you are getting personal on the subject - it's not a matter of blaming somebody (person,nation) it's just simple truth, you have probably seen my update of the Cyrilic section which has nothing to do with my personal opinion, but it is a simple fact - a historical fact. And how actually, can I not get angry, when the original post (about cyrillic aphabet) was talking that the other slavonic nations were some sort of proto russian cultures...
But all that is no mather of discussion of this forums, cause they are typographically not politally oriented, so consider the theme colsed...</div>

You don't get to decide that.

i'm sorry that you feel this way. regarding the [[typowiki]], it is quite imperfect and incomplete and in some ways leaves much to be desired when compared to Wikipedia. However, those who contribute do so in good faith and with no malice or political agenda (i believe) and statements made in the wiki article that you changed were not meant to offend. i am sure there are several contributors here on typophile who understand the history of the Cyrillic script very well, but have not taken the time or made the effort to contribute to the article in question, so i am glad that you want to make sure that typophiles have access to the facts concerning the development of the Cyrillic script. However, as a rule, typowiki authors are encouraged to avoid copying from other sources and pasting directly to the typowiki as you did in this case. The article already linked to the Wikipedia article, which you copied and i felt this was sufficient for readers researching the Cyrillic script. Please understand that our wiki is still very much in a developmental stage, and in some cases, articles serve more as a repository for links to discussions on a particular topic and sometimes the actual article content is lacking, but even if somewhat inaccurate or incomplete, i usually let this stand in the hopes that someone will come along and improve upon the article (or until i have time to do that myself!) please continue to help us and welcome to typophile!</div>

<div class=commentbody>>I’ve updated the sections of your site concerning the disputed language and writing system.
It might have been better to have critiqued the posts on the forum rather than "update" them, so that the crimes of the "Westerners" and "Russians" on Typophile could have been properly exposed. Also as Bulgaria is in the EU, isn't it a Western country too? </div>
