    of this website to review the typefaces you have designed? You could start by
    posting a link or a PDF specimen of them for us to see. "

    consider using the appropriate Critique forum:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/1\r\n\r\nThat
    will likely get more views and responses than a blog posting."
