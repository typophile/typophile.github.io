body: "I'm looking for examples of stencil type that is less masculine and more neutral
  or even feminine in appearance.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? I thinking more about how the
  counters are bridged than the actual font itself.\r\nThis is for reference so if
  you are not quite sure it fits the bill, post anyway and I will no doubt get something
  out of it.\r\n\r\nI know this is based on a preconception of what is masculine etc
  but nevermind, that's the field on which we play!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Thanks all.\r\n\r\nIt's for a fashion label, to be laser cut. I will design
    it from scratch but I am curious to see how/if any others tackled a similar problem.
    Like I said before, it's less about the base style and maybe more about the way
    it is converted to a stencil."

  body: Thanks David, Typonine caught my eye as having some atypical solutions, which
    is good because it carries less weight in association.
