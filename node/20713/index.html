<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I have always struggled with the names of specific fonts and type designers, as I am sure many others have. Doing a search here, I came up with a few threads that were of good reference, but none that were specifically attributed to this subject alone. So, here, we can clarify once and for all those cumbersome pronunciations so that I for one won't ever say Benguiat incorrectly ever again.
Some of the below I am including for the greater good, and some I am including because I am honestly unclear on the correct way to say the name. Hopefully, everyone else will contribute their own key's to the difficult pronunciations as well. I think that the best way to do this would be to play the phonics game, spell out the sounds? Right? if not, someone else can make that decision.
Additionally, I was thinking that this could be included into the Typowiki somehow. Obviously it would be best to have the information included under the specific articles for the designers, but, maybe there should also be a commonly mispronounced typeface/designer article as well?
Typefaces:
Belwe
Benguiat
Caecillia
Cheltenham
Cochin
Didot
Hiroshige
Hoefler
Type Designers:
Edward Beguiat
Charles Nicholas Cochin
Firmin Didot
Tobias Frere-Jones
Jonathan Hoefler
Aldus Manutius

<div class=commentbody>> <em>Benquiat - Ben-goo-at</em>
EEEK!
It's BEN-gat, unless you are a Spaniard, then it's BEN-gee-YAT!
The threads listed by Tim D cover a lot of previous discussions.
The problem you will have with pronunication is that many typefaces were named after actual people and places... something that always gets confused in pronunciation depending on the language it is spoken in.
Key points to consider would be --
If it's the name of the person, it should be pronounced the way that person (or those who knew that person) would say it.
(Like the old Monty Python skit-- "It's spelled Luxury Yacht, but it's pronounced Throatwarbler Mangrove.")
If it's named after a place, then it's based on the designer's pronunciation, <em>n'est pas</em>?
Example: Depending on whether the designer is from NYC or Lyon, typefaces named "France" "Nice" "Paris" would all sound different.
Each language has it's own way of inflecting and pronouncing, so does that mean that "Frutiger" and "Univers" is pronounced wrong in a majority of the world languages?
For the most part, I think many of us do NOT want to sound like idiots, especially when speaking with learned or experienced type directors and designers. The thing is, even when you listen carefully at International conferences, pronunciations vary slightly.
I'm surprised you didn't have "Lubalin" in the topic thread list.

<div class=commentbody>"and 'Univers' is pronounced wrong in a majority of the world languages?"
In fact, you can pronounce Univers as you like, they specifically chose a name that is pronouncable in many languages, instead of "Monde" as it was proposed by Frutiger. After all, Univers was meant to be a "typeface for all people and all times" (or similar). This is also the reason why they introduced the numbers system: They only needed packaging and price lists in one language, which the French would read as "Univers cinquante-cinq", the English as "Univers fity-five" and so on.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Funny how English trying to do 'American' and visa versa regularly get it wrong in characteristic ways. English trying to affect an American accent pronounce 'very' as 'vurry' (rhymes with furry), trying and failing to get the American 'r'. Americans trying to affect an English accent pronounce 'very' as 'veddy', trying and failing to get the English 'r'.
Some English and Australian actors are brilliant at catching the American accent, though. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Not only Americans, Chris. I had the exact same experience in Scotland two years ago. The further north I went, the harder it was to understand anyone! After asking directions from a man on the road, I turned to my husband, blinked at him and said, "Just drive".
It's such an odd thing, isn't it? I mean, we enunciate correctly, speak slowly, what's the problem? Why can't we understand each other? Just as you wrote, I'm sure that gentleman barely understood me.
(And I don't say "Nu" but I do say "ey!". Ey? : ) )</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you've never seen Robin MacNeal's 7 (?) part series on English, try to track it down. It's about 20 years old. He covers English as spoken in the U.K., parts of the U.S., Japan and other places.
I am blessed with the ability to hear (and repeat) subtle aural nuances. At a party one time, I heard a guy say a couple of sentences and said "You're from Massapequa, aren't you?" He said "Do I know you?" He was indeed from Massapequa (LI, NY), not far from my hometown. But this was in Atlanta more than a decade after I'd moved. I love accents.</div>
