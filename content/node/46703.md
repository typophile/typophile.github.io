body: "I am so frustrated.  I have a client who would like no breaks in the words
  in the body of text for an ad with a preferably fully justified column.  That's
  fine by me, word breaks are irritating.  I am creating the ad in InDesign.  I try
  to correct the breaks by adding more spaces between some words or by using the enter
  key to send the broken word down to the next line in its entirety.  The problem
  is that every time I make one word whole, the program decided to break another word
  or  two or three in lines above it, or whatever is totally unrelated to the line
  I am messing with.  Messing with the tracking and kerning doesn't help either.  Is
  there any way to override this evil program's passion for broken words?  I mean,
  even in any justified format, the problem does not go away. \r\n\r\nI'm not perfectly
  versed in InDesign.  Maybe there is something I am missing.  I am using 7 pt Adobe
  Caslon Pro currently in a 1.375 inch text column.  I have a 2 inch column (1.75
  with a wee border) to work with but, I need room for an image on the side.  I've
  tried it in News Gothic STD and ITC Eras (it was too fashion magazine for my client
  but, he didn't know the difference).  According to him, I am not allowed to change
  the wording of his description so, for making things fit without word breaks, I
  am lost, and getting beyond frusterated.  I'd tell him I can't get rid of them all
  but, I think there has to be a way I am missing.\r\n\r\nThis ad is for a newspaper's
  classified section and of course, he wants it to stand out.  I'm trying to use the
  corporate Identity font he uses for the heading ( he had some idiot make a logo
  who badly based it off Arquitectura\r\n... probably from the late 80's... thats
  the feeling I get at least)  He has no interest in creating a new and more aesthetically
  pleasing logo.\r\n\r\nIs there something that better compliments Arquitectura as
  a heading in body copy?  Does anyone have a suggestion to a good professional businessman
  font personality.  I don't think I'm limited to Arquitectura as a heading if there
  are any suggestions.\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to present some arguements to my work with
  my client with quoted evidence on why I do something a certain way... I gather my
  education certainly isn't shining through when I explain the concept of legibility
  as I have been taught.  He wants me to make the ad smaller. It's already 2x4.5inches.
  With the font I'm using and the ligature the body is 1.375x3/3/4inches.  The contact
  info I have set in Helvetica nue 47 Light condenced is 3 lines taking up 1/2 inch
  height  and the titling taking a 1/2 inch height.  I could make the ad thinner if
  I didn't have to use an image that take up 1/2 inch column but, I don't think that
  would do me any good because I am working with 1 inch classified columns and allowed
  to  take 2... I have to work with the space to take 2.  \r\n\r\nNo image would be
  a great idea, then I could widen the text column and  shorten the height of it...
  Yeah, it's late, im tired, frustrated and rambling. "

  body: "Hi Pamela,\r\nswitch off hyphenation in the paragraph options palette (or,
    even better, via your paragraph styles).\r\nAdditionally, you can try using the
    Adobe Single-Line Composer (in place of the Adobe Paragraph Composer, see flyout-menu
    in paragraph options palette), for a better manual control over each line.\r\nF"

  body: "I cannot believe it - I can answer an InDesign question.\r\n\r\nYou can stay
    in paragraph composer - no problem. Where ever you want the typeset line to end
    place a \"shift return\" in. It breaks it and starts the next line. \r\n\r\nThen
    again, I've asked for the quark keyboard with the InDesign I work with - and it's
    one of those great features I couldn't live without.\r\n\r\nHope that helps and
    makes it a bit easier for you."
