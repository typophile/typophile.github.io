  Italic is a display typeface intended to be viewed at large sizes. Because of it\u2019s
  heavy weight and distinctive small serifs the typeface is best used on headings
  and titles. Inspired by latex textures, many characters use rounded shapes to show
  off the fluid forms of the letters. Please do let me know your thoughts. Please
  see our site for more examples of work: http://www.filthymedia.com .

  body: "It's really nice to see this finished \u2014 I often used to walk along Kensington
    Gardens wondering about progress :) Any plans to release, or is it just for in-house
    use at your studio?\r\n\r\nI can see a few problems with the rhythm, but it's
    hard to tell exactly without a printout. It looks like the counter areas vary
    a lot in different letters, so the whitespace is uneven. \r\n"

  body: "For display purposes I tried to use serifs much smaller than you would expect
    to use with a typeface like this. I just nabbed the copy text we used for the
    typeface, so 'distinctive' is probably the wrong word! :)\r\n\r\nI don't consider
    it completely finished, but its going to be a continual work in progress with
    a few other typefaces i'm working on - were just using it for posters / promotional
    work in-house at the moment - would love to release once I have some time to work
    on the problems..."

  body: "Hi,\r\nfor evaluating purposes, any effect like embossing is annoying. \r\nOk
    if you want compact serifs, but shouldn't they be higher/bolder?\r\nI feel especially
    uncomfortable with /a/A/K/S/\r\nfigures weight seems inconsistent;\r\nwhy math
    operators are upright?\r\n"

  body: "Love it as a screen font, but I ask myself how is this going to print?\r\nConsistency
    will be hard to keep for each user's experience of this font.\r\nYour zoomed in
    view of the <strong>\xE3</strong> and <strong>\xE9</strong> has a greater and
    shorter gradient run to white in the <strong>\xE9</strong> than the <strong>\xE3</strong>.\r\nThe
    <strong>\xE9</strong> will print with the intended effect because of the stronger
    white, the <strong>\xE3</strong> won't.\r\nThis might make some letters look patchy
    or not as strong with the faded effect.\r\nSome letters might print the gradient
    blend. Some will look posterized or sudden in the change from black to white.\r\n\r\nIt's
    too hard an effect to maintain in print. I'd stay a million miles away from trying
    something like that, but hey, on screen it looks fine.\r\n\r\nGood Luck "
