  body: I found [[http://blogs.library.ucla.edu/digitallibraryprogram/2011/06/24/armenian-and-ethiopic-manuscripts/|this
    interesting article]] which is the first time someone else has, to my knowledge,
    noted the apparent resemblance - no doubt entirely coincidental - between the
    Ethiopic script and the Armenian script.

  body: I do not think there was much written about it in English, except maybe in
    Iceland Review, but there was a case of the unknown manuscript in the news&hellip;
    last year, I think. I was sure from the pictures that it was Armenian, but it
    was IDed as Ethiopian.
