    his work?\r\n\r\nI just began studying Hebrew type design, and wanted to contact
    him.... I suppose that wont be possible anymore."

  body: "I contacted Henri Friedlaeder before his demise.\r\n\r\nItamar David (is
    he alive), Henri Friedlaeder zal, and \u1E92vi Narkiss zal, were supreme Hebrew
    type designers, each from Europe.\r\n\r\nFrederik Goudy claims the famous and
    extremely popular Romm family printing press Vilna and Rashi typefaces were cut
    by Bodoni's students in Italy, based upon ancient drawings from earlier periods
    of the disapora.\r\n\r\nThese designs predate the popular misconception of dating
    them from the invention of the printing press. Also, the so called invention of
    block print was actually much earlier.\r\n\r\nYet, there are those who prefer
    to believe all Wiki incorrect scholarship they read on the Internet.\r\n\r\nFor
    serious typography resource, dig into the collections at RIT's library (RIT is
    funded by the CIA for subterranean image tracking - nuclear weapons under ground)
    and those in Paris. Scott, where?\r\n\r\nI lived in Rochester, NY, very near RIT
    (NY's MIT - what MIT is in mathematics, RIT is in imaging, type, print, and paper.\r\n\r\nI
    saw actual historical documents, samples, and amazing maps, showing how nuclear
    weapons under ground for example could by determined from two images taken about
    ground in a jet at two opposite 45 degree angles, using custom plug-ins to Adobe
    Photoshop. The software could \"remove\" the surface dirt and identify the exact
    spot of the nuclear weapons under ground  by tracking its infrared 'heat'.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    this technology is used for 'reading' the Dead Sea Scrolls, and archaeology.\r\n\r\nI
    also gathered there information that my family ancestors supplied the Romm family
    printing press with a 50 year very multi-million ruble paper contract from the
    department head, who was the world expert on paper.\r\n\r\nBill, forget Wiki,
    and fly to Rochester for a week."
