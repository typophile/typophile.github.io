body: Sorry for the bad quality, but this is the new issue of I-D magazine and I was
  wondering whether any of you know what typeface they use on the cover (it's in white).
  You would really help me out, thank you for your time!

  body: Firstly thought it could have been a bespoke typeface. Was also hesitating
