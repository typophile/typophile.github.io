  body: "The lettering in your sample is hand-drawn, judging from the two e's that
    have different tails. The i dots seem to be different sizes as well, so it's no
    wonder you were unable to find it. You could also look at [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script08Pg1.html|Part
    8]] (or [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg1.html|part6]]) of my Script
    Font ID Guide for other similar styles.\r\n\r\nFlorian's suggestion is a good
    one too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
