  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have been dropped in the deep end and was recommended by someone to ask here for help.
My predicament is that I created a typeface/font a while ago and wacked it on dafont for free for personal use and left a note saying email me about commercial use not expecting anything. I have now received an email from an award winning ad agency asking for a quote for 15 users, print and web use. This is pretty great news to come out of the blue but I am really stuck on how I'd price this. It's just a singe weight font with a small amount of glyphs(bare essentials). I also would love help on how I'd find create an appropriate licence for this.

I really need help from someone with a lot more experience than me and this seems to be the place to be.

Thanks in advance,
xTeraa</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice!
I think the fee should depend most of all on how unique it is; if there are many similar fonts out there, you can't ask for too much... Could you show the font in question?

In terms of authoring a license, I recommend emulating –but not copying– my favorite:

It's nothing amazingly unique in terms of style just a handwritten typeface. It be nice to get something from the work I did. I don't even know the ballpark for something like this since I'm more of a Graphic Designer than a Type Designer.

Thank you for the links on licencing I will start reading through and creating one for this. Should I do a licence specifically for the deal (specifying 15 users and use on web/print).</div>

My gut feeling –that's all I can offer– says under $1000.

Something else BTW: your font is pretty unlikely to render well onscreen, at least at smaller sizes, FYI.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the sizing tip, I'm guessing this is something inherent with the font design and not the way it was made?

And as for pricing I was thinking around £300 for it all and that is way under $1000. I think it is a good price since as you said there are tons of other free commercially usable fonts or is this underselling it? I didn't even think it be close to $1000 and thought £300 might be pushing it.

I can't thank you enough for the help by the way.</div>
