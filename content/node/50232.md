  to post my own work up for critique.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logo for a company
  called TMA. They are a tool sharpening company for mostly custom/specialized tools
  and serve clients like Lockheed Martin. Their preferred direction was something
  simple, more modern, and clean looking so this is what I came up with. I tried to
  suggest a drill bit-like shape with the letterforms while keeping the elements \"sharp\"
  looking. Please let me know you thoughts. Logo design is probably where I'm weakest
  right now as a designer so any helpful criticism is welcome. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tma_5003.jpg]"

  body: "My first thought is that you are on the right track.\r\n\r\nMy next thought
    is that you might not have to force everything to fit together so tool-like. I
    think the letters T, M, A stacked vertically would still feel \"toolish\", even
    if they kept a little more of their letter-shapes. Router bits, or something that
    has been turned on a lathe, for example, don't necessarily have edges that are
    flat all the way down the sides, as this logo is. Luckily, the letters are all
    symmetrical, so part of your \"machined\" look is already done for you (aren't
    you glad the company isn't RPJ?)\r\n\r\nI would try some that open the space up
    between the letters a bit, so that the TMA is a little more clearly \"readable\"
    at a glance... of course that is just my first thought of suggestion\u2013you
    get to have the fun of playing around with it. Perhaps the point of the M could
    meet the upper point of the A?\r\n\r\nHave fun, and keep us posted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    set with a slightly ascending cropped baseline.

  body: "Maybe not have the left side of the \"A\" go so far over. Maybe just make
    a regular \"A\" with a crossbar. I like the T and the M but the A isn't readable
    to me and makes the whole logo not look like the initials.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: 'This is an excellent start. I think you are taking the drill bit motif too
    literally. You may have gone a little too far in abstracting the letters, especially
    the "A" - it is completely unreadable as an A. What I would imagine is very important
    in this kind of business is precision. Abstracting the letter forms is fine but
    their message still needs to be precise. '

  body: "I also think the letters are much too abstract but I like your approach to
    \"keeping it sharp\". \r\n\r\nI would definitely suggest doing a version that
    reads \"TMA\" left to right, instead of vertically. You also might play with the
    idea of sharpening up each individual letter. T could be soft, M could be a hybrid
    between soft and sharp, and A could be sharp. (Might be hard to do subtly enough,
    without looking silly and amateurish.) But the idea of making the type do what
    the company is about, is definitely worth pursuing.\r\n\r\n"
