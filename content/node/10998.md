  body: 'I don&#39;t think you can change anything to your trouble. Its because Stone
    use a name mixture of Medium who is close to Regular but not standard, and SemiBold
    who is close to Bold but not standard too. So, as none of the applications you
    use, use font names in same way, some built the names from some ressources, others
    from others, you can do anything more than don&#39;t switch all the time of appl.
    <BR> <BR>The reflow is done because: one time, the Medium is used and in other
    case, the Semi is used. no? <BR> <BR>You in are in front what contemporary type
    designers have in front of them when they built large families cross platform.
    No standard at all! ;-&#40;'
