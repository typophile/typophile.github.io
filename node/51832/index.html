  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>I think I posted this logotype here a while ago, but I wanted to run it by you again, as we&rsquo;re getting ready to do a little rebranding.</p>
<p>The Fort Wayne Dance Collective is a 30-year old non-profit arts organization in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which focuses on movement, rhythm and language as a performance art. Although the organization started as a modern dance studio, it&rsquo;s grown to be much more than just dance, and it incorporates a school with dozens of kinds of classes, a taiko drumming ensemble, a jenbé drumming ensemble, yoga, t&rsquo;ai chi, etc.</p>
<p>There has been talk of changing its name, since &ldquo;Dance Collective&rdquo; is no longer completely accurate, but since that has been our name for 30 years, and that&rsquo;s what everyone knows us by, that may not happen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re waiting to get a grant for a big rebranding campaign from a local Advertising &amp; PR firm, and although they&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of work for us, something I wanted some preliminary help with from you fine folks is our logo. It is (hopefully) going to get redesigned.</p>
<p>I have some background in design, but not so much as I think I could take on this task. I want to run our current logo by you and see what you might do to make it looks better, so when I go to them with some basic ideas, I won&rsquo;t sound like an idiot.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s the logo and the wording:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/FWDClogotype_6330.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Before I came, the little pair of people dancing were not enclosed in a circle, so everytime they were displayed, it looked insignificant and too engulfed by white space. I inversed the dancers and enclosed them in a purple circle, which is FWDC&rsquo;s main color. I haven&rsquo;t had the heart to nix the little spirally things and the confetti, as my director really loves it.</p>
<p>The type is in DaVinci, which was brought to the table by a cheap freelancer 8 or 9 years ago. I like what it is trying to accomplish, but I just don&rsquo;t like how the letters connect together. I tried to bring in the kerning a little bit, but it just doesn&rsquo;t do it for me.</p>
<p>I would like this to morph into something that is a really nice, tight, self-contained design. At the same time, though, I want to convey that the Dance Collective is a progressive, revolutionary arts org that is on its way up in profile, but still maintains its grassroots, something that&rsquo;s few and far between here in conservative northeast Indiana.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or ideas? I would love to hear any of them.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>-Andy Welfle</p>
