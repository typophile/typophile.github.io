body: I&#39;d like to begin working on a bitmap face design. I&#39;m not sure, though
  how one does that &#40;the technics, I mean&#41;. When I design &#34;normal&#34;
  typefaces, I usually draw vector letters in Illustrator, and then import them into
  Fontographer.  <BR> <BR>What is different with totally-bitmap designs? Are the letters
  first drawn in photoshop, and then imported into FontLab? Or are they drawn in FontLab
  directly? What about this grey-pixel stuff? From what I&#39;ve read recently in
  these forums, I gather that they are actually vector drawings, made to look like
  bitmaps but with varying shades of grey? This can&#39;t be done in FOG, can it?
  <BR> <BR>I have FOG, and can access FontLab via school and work. I haven&#39;t ever
  used FontLab, though. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    you&#39;ll probably be making pixelfonts: outline fonts that snap to the &#34;intended&#34;
