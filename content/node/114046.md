body: "Hello,\r\nI just started writing my master thesis in LyX and I am looking for
  an easy to read font. I am absolutely new to typography and I would like to know
  what you guys think about Palatino Linotype, Adobe Garamond Pro or Adobe Minion
  Pro? \r\nMy thesis is not very technical or mathematical. It is mostly plain text
  (default size 12) with some images and charts. There will be a printed version and
  a pdf. Which font would you suggest for my use case? \r\nThank you very much! :)

  body: "There are hundreds if not thousands of fonts that are sufficiently readable
    for most purposes. The tricky \u2013and rewarding\u2013 part is selecting a typeface
    with the right mood, to subtly \"amplify\" your content (assuming it also has
    a character set that covers all your needs, including those in the near-future).\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your thesis about?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for the quick reply! To sum it up I write about corporate communication.
    It is about the transformation processes in a web society with a special focus
    on the media and innovative journalism.  \r\nSo it is definitely not dry topic.
    The concept is a positive, forwardlooking view on the internet."

  body: Don't universities usually have rules regarding the typeface choice and point
    size when it comes to your thesis? Anyway, I've recently been using Freight Text
    for the body of school documents.

  body: "Thanks for all the replies! At the moment I am using Minion Pro (serif) for
    the body and Myriad Pro (sans-serif) for the headlines. In my humble opinion they
    go together. What do you think about this font pairing?\r\n@Martin Silvertant:
    Yes they have rules but I do not think they match my thesis very good. I thought
    about @hrant's \"...subtly amplify your content\" and I think Minion Pro is a
    good choice. I am not quite sure about Myriad Pro. Maybe Frutiger...  I try to
    match fonts from the same font foundry. I read that is a good idea? :)"

  body: "Minion and Myriad do seem to go pretty well together, though I usually prefer
    a higher contrast between body and titling fonts. I paired Freight Text with Brandon
    Grotesque.\r\n\r\nIf the font foundry is small it might be a good idea to pair
    fonts from the same foundry but not necessarily. Bigger foundries offer so much
    variety that pairing fonts from the same foundry has no impact on the quality
    of the result. I wouldn't let which foundry it came from restrict your choices."
