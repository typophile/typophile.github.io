  I've always been a fan of the old Mountain Dew bottles. As a junior designer, I
  realized that I don't know what in Sam Hill their typeface is, and I'm reasonably
  certain it's not a custom one. I know the one on the right is, but the three on
  the left--can anyone help? Thanks!"

  body: It may be custom as the two n I can see are not quite the same but that may
    also be distortion in the photo - will look for better photo

  body: Mike you may be right that it is photo type. In the back of the VGC catalogs
    were a  bunch of hand lettered looking fonts that had numbers and letters and
    no names (F-23, F14 etc). They seem to have been a staple of the photo type setting
    catalogs and even the type houses in New York had different ones than the VGC
    catalogs.

  body: "When I was looking at the Photolettering catalog for 1960 some time ago I
    was impressed by the very long list of lettering artists that had contributed
    work. I also recall that there were a large number of brush lettering fonts that
    looked similar to this. Most had names that I have not seen elsewhere. Very few
    are digitized.\r\nDon"

  body: "It is rather similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/dom-casual/
    ?refby=bowfin|Dom Casual]], but digital brush lettering rarely seems to have this
    double-story 'a'. It may have been a film type, or more likely done for them by
    a lettering artist.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
