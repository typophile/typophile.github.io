  webmaster. Alas, with him went all the information (color codes, fonts, etc) so
  i'm in a bit of a pickle.\r\nCan anyone recognize this font?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_5344.png]\r\nFrom
  what i've heard it is \"certainly a default font\" but so far looking through my
  system fonts haven't helped much.\r\n\r\nThanks"
