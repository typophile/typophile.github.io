  The poster will be folded open, but the content will not necessarily be neatly contained
  in each 5\" x 7\" section \u2014 some content takes over two panels, some all three).
  \r\n\r\nWhat is a best practice for creating a grid for such a poster? \r\n\r\nCurrently
  my grid divides each 5\" x 7\" section, with gutters that allow for room across
  each fold. While this ensures that small type near the fold will not cross it, the
  poster contains content that spans multiple columns and sections. This results in
  an uneven spacing of said columns (six columns appear more like three columns on
  one section followed by a large gutter and three more columns in another section).\r\n\r\nI
  can't have it both ways \u2014 either the typographic grid will align with the folding
  grid, causing some gutter issues, or the typographic grid will not align with the
  folding grid. What's the best way?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    column spacing less obvious.\r\n\r\nFor articles that span folds, perhaps a graphic
    element could be used to visually group together the related text. For example,
    put a tinted background behind the article's columns, or put them in a box, or
    have a rule span those columns, or group those columns via text style or color."

  body: "Thanks to you both.\r\n\r\nI had read the Vignelli cannon before, but confess
    I had forgotten about it. A re-reading had me re-consider my complex grid and
    come up with something more simple. I used 1 pica margins for the left and right,
    and 2 pica column gutters. Using James' advice on running rag right text, the
    large gutters seem less imposing, especially with a minimum type size of 8pt.
    \r\n\r\nThanks again."
