  20 pts and no body text. As a newbie in font design I would really appreciate any
  comments or earned wisdom. Especially thoughts on the v,w, and x and on the 8 which
  is giving me grief. <BR> <BR>thanks <BR> <BR>ka <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14317.jpg"

  body: 'Kathrin: Your font looks interesting, but it&#39;s difficult to tell what&#39;s
    going on at the size you posted. I see a number of inconsistencies, but perhaps
    they are intentional. Are you presenting alternate characters in &#34;Sprue Regular&#34;?
    My initial suggestions would be to a&#41; do some caps, b&#41; give the characters
    some air &#40;they are way too tight&#41;, c&#41; settle on a basic character
    set for &#34;Regular&#34;, then expand from there. <BR> <BR>Another thought would
    be to concentrate on the basic letter forms in &#34;Sprue Less&#34;, then adapt
    it later to &#34;Regular&#34;. <BR> <BR>My first thoughts are that you are too
    scattered. Try to simplify your processes. It will take a lot of effort, but keep
    at it and you may be surprised at how fast it starts taking shape. <BR> <BR>PS.
    I am especially fond of the lc &#34;q&#34;.'

  body: 'Hi Kathrin. Nice work. Most of the transliteration type fonts I see, especially
    in the Indian flavor have hard lines. This is much softer, original and I like
    it a lot. '
