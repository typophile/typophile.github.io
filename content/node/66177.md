  proud; Suomi Script is now number eight in MyFonts Hot New Fonts-list. It's the
  first of my fonts ever to climb that high. \r\n\r\nTee Franklin went pretty high,
  but never got to top ten. Suomi Sans and Suomi Slab Serif are on the list as well,
  but at the bottom half."

  body: Great for you! Some of that other self promotion of yours have all over the
    place hijacking threads and it really gives me a bad impression of you. I wish
    you'd let your work do the talking, because some of it is really nice.

  body: Thanks, for your comments, guys. They are very much appreciated. Frode, I
    already apologized in another thread, but once again, I am very sorry about hijacking
    the threads. I take your comments to heart, and I will try my very best to have
    some restraint from now on.
