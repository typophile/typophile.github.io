  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hiya, long time no see.
I recently had a font identified for me at myfonts, and someone came to the conclusion that it would have to be Castcraft/OPTIFonts' Eton. Now, first of all, I've been doing some research on this OPTIFonts and people on forums like these doesn't hold them in such a high regard, eh? ;)

Well, I'm with you. The website is just an outrage, because I can't reach their font catalogue and see if this Eton is the actual font I'm looking for. So now I turn to you guys & gals. Here's the text sample:
http://wtf.myfonts.com/images/4b/4baaa9e85b5ddbeb9fedba44e12035d6.43347.jpeg
Before the OPTIFonts information someone mentioned it was originally issued by VGC (Visual Graphics Corporation, http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/vgc-typefaces.html) as Wexford Medium and later on digitalized by the dreaded OPTIFonts, if this is to any help.

Any ideas? If you need more samples, I can get a hold of them for you, but they'll be relatively small. Thanks in advance!</div>

Oh well, perhaps we'll see it in the future. Are there any fonts similiar to Wexford (Medium)? Like Banjoman, Blippo, Argentica or Bernhard Gothic from that page bowpinpw provided.</div>

I'm looking for a font which I believe to be called Opti Schow Light. I have scoured the web though, and have had no luck in finding anything. Do you know of the existence of such a font? Do you have any idea where I may be able to obtain it? If not do you know of an equivalent?

Thanks so much in advance!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, I found another forum online where someone else was looking for this same font, in that thread (http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/27578/) they determined that the name of the font is in fact Schow Light by OPTIFonts.

Does anyone know where I might be able to find this font?

I've searched all over for both OPTIFonts and CastCraft who I believe owned them at one point, but I have been unable to find a working website for either of them. It's almost as though both companies have disappeared. Any ideas???

		<div class="commentbody">From what I understand Castcraft/Opti is defunct. I know from my past days IDing fonts at alt.binaries.fonts that there were copies of Opti fonts being circulated, but the RIGHT way to go about it is to find out the true identity for the font and find a legal version. Almost nothing offered by Opti was original, and most are available from other sources by other names.

Here is a sample I just made with the font.

BTW, the original post was about Wexford, and Harold Lohner has revived it as Wexley, I believe.
