    There's a digital font in the same style called [[http://myfonts.us/td-4pg5W5|Saturday
    Morning Toast]] (Nick Curtis, 2001).

  body: "If you are talking about the two-line nameplate that ran the full width of
    the cover, it was most likely hand-drawn\u2014not a typeface. That particular
    nameplate actually dates from the very early 1900s and was used for decades.\r\n\r\nAmerican
    Type Founders did release a typeface called Curtis Post in 1902. It was based
    on Post Oldstyle Roman No. 2, which was the model for hand-lettered headings in
    the magazine at the time:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-71374.html\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/EJKitson-or-GuernseyMoore-or-HermannIhlenburg--PostOldstyleRomanNo2--1901.png\r\n\r\nThere
    are a few digital \u201Ctribute\u201D typefaces:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/lamp-post/\r\n\r\nAnother
    typeface from that era that is very similar is Windsor:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/windsor-mt/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm not a fan of the \"rugged\" style of lettering used in the masthead --
    but if you are a fan of distressed and antique lettering styles, your mileage
    will differ. \r\nI prefer the polished version made by Nick Curtis.\r\nFor searchers
    of authentic versions of the letterhead the I concur in the  posted information
    on Curtis Post of 1902 and Post Oldstyle Roman No. 2.\r\nEvery major foundry of
    circa 1900 produced similar \"rugged\" rounded letter fonts of similar weight.
    If there is any interest I will post a list.\r\nDon."
