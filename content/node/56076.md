body: "Hello there, everybody! Been forever since my last post. Good to be back. Been
  busy.\r\n\r\nSo, my fiancee is working on a short animation film, and obviously,
  it will have titles/credits, etc. Being the designer, and her the animator, I thought
  I'd help out. However, her peers have been advising her about public broadcast of
  fonts used, stating there are certain restrictions one can get in legal troubles
  with. The last thing we want is to have her opus stifled by some legal restriction
  of a font used. \r\n\r\nMy question is this: If I buy my typefaces used at MyFonts
  (for example), paying the fee listed, are we able to use them for public/broadcast
  use, etc.? I guess I'm not sure if there are differences between print licensing
  for use, and broadcast licensing for use. I planned on designing a logotype of sorts
  to be used for her film, which could be used on the film, brochures, promos, t-shirts,
  whatever. It's possible these could somehow lead to profit, etc. But each and every
  font used, we will be purchasing for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI did find a post on here
  about this already:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/3701\r\nBut his case was describing
  a freeware font issue.\r\n\r\nSo....after all that....Thoughts? Legal reference?
  If I purchase them, are we in the clear?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Josh"

    any font you're interested in."

    Most just say not to distribute, etc. So I guess unless they specifically prohibit
    broadcast? \r\n"

  body: By 'distribute' they mean the fonts themselves (re-package, re-sell), not
    the product using the fonts, such as logo or typeset text, I think.
