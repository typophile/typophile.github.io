<p>In that case, you could perhaps be more specific about what kind of problems, because it is the nature of design to solve problems.</p>
<p>In saying that all my faces solve problems, I should admit that mostly they are problems I&rsquo;ve created, such as &ldquo;What would a slab serif  designed by Bodoni look like?&rdquo; Most type designs could be described like that, e.g. &ldquo;What would my version of a squarish sans serif look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I understand it, Erik Spiekermann&rsquo;s take on this is that types developed for use in specific projects have an inherent virtue.
So those would concern problems a client has created, such as, &ldquo;What kind of face would work best in this particular corporate branding, for its particular media uses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Different from both these are types which address problems of reproduction in specific media (e.g. Verdana) or problems of legibility in specific media (e.g. Clearview), or problems of readability with specific categories of reader (e.g. Century Schoolbook).</p>

<p>I have to mention the types designed for The Century Magazine, designed by father, then son Bentons, as being an incredible fall back collection for me. They were developed to work well with the magazine, tall x-height (appears larger on page), designed to fit space well, and as a result using up less paper in printing.</p>
<p>Century Old Style (and derivatives) are my &lsquo;copyfitting&rsquo; standby whenever space is limited and copy is rich!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fantômas,</p>
<p>I share your fascination with &ldquo;purpose-driven&rdquo; typefaces, designs like Bell Centennial, Georgia, Clearview etc. While Nick is right about all typefaces (and indeed all design work) solving some problem, I think you mean something a bit more specific, mainly dealing with physical/real-world constraints. I think his breakdown of these types of problems (reproduction in specific media, legibility in specific media etc) is a useful way to look at this stuff.</p>
<p>For a while I was working on a typeface meant for E-Ink screens, similar to how Georgia and Verdana were designed for monitors. Turns out there are E-Ink screens with good enough resolution that there wasn&rsquo;t really a need for the typeface, so I abandoned the project pretty early on.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve done which addresses reproduction in specific media was a [[http://exfishgeekgraf.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/first-test/|stencil typeface for easy cutting by hand]]. Most common stencil faces were designed to be produced by machines, and are very hard to cut by hand with a hobby knife. Gerard Unger gets close to a solution with [[http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns13.html|Decoder]]. Lots of folks in the street art community use computers for designing their stencils, thouhg most don&rsquo;t have access to laser cutters. I&rsquo;ve recently resumed work on this project, which was started at a time when I knew very little about letterforms and type design, and the results are naïve in many ways.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, what&rsquo;s been said here about &ldquo;all of the above&rdquo; seems to make sense, that there are many reasons that typefaces get made. I&rsquo;ve been doing thesis research on type revivals and there are many different motivations that go into reviving a face. Could be a client wants it, could be your own fascination with a historical form, could be for academic purposes&hellip;the list goes on.</p>
