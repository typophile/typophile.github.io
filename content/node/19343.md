  Real Kilbirnie Serif thread. Feijoa developed from that, and Karbon Serif as well.
  Here is an unspaced lower-case only sketch. I will be interested to know what it
  does to your eyes!\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

  body: "This is absolutely brilliant. \r\nI hesitate to criticise the two things
    I'm not sure about, because they're fine as they are and obviously part of your
    concept. Have you considered taking the triangular serifs on a, u, m, n and r
    half way towards slabs, and introducing a white wedge into the top of r, which
    is too much like the top of p for text comfort?"

    weights are you working on, are you going for the full family?

  body: "I will add my compliments to the heap, and then get down to what I see. \r\n\u2022The
    tail of the y is a bit lo-fi. I have this issue with Joanna too. I don't think
    any harm would be done by narrowing it at the baseline to the same thickness as
    the other hairline, and letting it flare out to the thickness it's already at
    on the descender line. (Perhaps let it flare just a bit less than that, so it
    doesn't look too handsome.)\r\n\u2022On the b, I might raise by just a little
    the point where the top of the bowl meets the stem (make it flatter).\r\n\u2022The
    quotation marks are totally out of character. Give them a point. Harmonize them
    with your lowercase finials.\r\n\u2022I see nothing wrong with the bottom part
    of the s.\r\n\u2022While as a standalone the r looks pretty lousy, when I read
    it I didn't get stuck at it. This may be just me. I'm not sure if a more \"normal\"
    r would diverge from the font. But you never know until you try: invent one you
    think would harmonize, and then test it out side-by-side with the current. I'll
    think about this r and other possible forms.\r\n\u2022The t seems lifeless. A
    sort of t I've been using a lot in my sketches of fonts is the kind in (for lack
    of a better font that comes to mind) Slimbach, only with a right, not isosceles,
    spur on the top. I think you could make use of this. Also perhaps make it a bit
    wider. Worked for Galliard.\r\n\r\nThat's all I've got for now. Bring us the rest
    of Karbon (tremendous name)--capitals, numerals, italic...\r\n(when you can.)"

  body: "What I love about Kris' typography it's I see it like something it could
    have happened should I have had the opportunity of seriously designing typefaces
    for a living.\r\n\r\nI mean, when in 1994 I had the basic idea which ended up
    in the release of Ottomat, it was all about the reversed relationship between
    vertical and horizontal strokes, in certain letters. In typefaces like Prokyon
    (is that the name? the one from the Dutch Type Foundry), the thing did not work
    so correctly applied in a textsetting face.\r\nWith Kris' work here (and I see
    Salamanca shares some of this \"building grammar\"), the thing has a degree of
    consistency previously undreamed of.\r\n\r\nI agree. It looks like something from
    the (early) 22nd centuty. While, maybe, Ottomat looked like a dream induced by
    peyote of the 1930s of an alternate reality.\r\nAnyway, if Kris likes my opinion,
    this is more worth pursuing than Salamanca, to reply Paul's question on the approaching
    works order."
