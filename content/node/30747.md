body: "Hello all.  I am a cartographer (well, cartography grad student) with a keen
  interest in typography and type design.  I was wondering if you knew of typefaces
  designed specifically for cartography, or at least with an eye to cartographic usage.
  \ I know only of <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2276/cisalpin.html?PHPSESSID=1298682fc3cee7d2c05788eaa248e93c#bild03\">Cisalpin</a>
  by Felix Arnold.  A cool face, but without enough weights/varieties.  Many of my
  fellow map-makers rely heavily on Garamond, Helvetica, Frutiger, Meridien, Sabon,
  Gill Sans, Univers, and Stone for labeling and annotation.  These are great faces
  and surely sufficient for most map designs \u2013 just wondering if any cartography-specific
  faces are out there.  I look forward to continuing my typographic education here
  on Typophile!"

    and you can set it very compact because of its short descenders. Furthermore it
    has a few more weights than Cisalpin including Smallcaps also the weights differ
    noticeable from each other.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/parable/"

  body: "I just got finished reading <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/site/index.php>Typotheque's</a>
    amazing Fedra Sans and Serif type specimen. As Fedra is so incredibly well-done,
    comes in four weights and three widths, and can be serif, sans, small cap, and
    italic, it might be ideally flexible for cartography.\r\n\r\nWhile they're not
    necessarily made for maps, both <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000074#specimen>Incognito</a>
    and <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000069#specimen>Zanzibar</a>
    (by Gabor Kothay) come from the spirit of antique, exotic maps. Incognito is especially
    cartographic, taking its ornaments and swashes from a book of maps. I'm desperately
    in love with both of them."

  body: Dan, those cartographic typefaces are really cool, especially Kursivschrift.
    But why do most of them have such strong obliques and "reverse" obliques (which
    I've never seen before) -- is it a German thing or a cartographic thing?

  body: "I think this is a cartographic thing.\r\n\r\nIn cartography, creating a hierarchy
    of information is very important. Not-upright text has to instantly visibly different,
    hence the sharp incline. Reverse inclines allow you to add a third dimension.
    I suspect that this is ok on maps because the normal, text-based legibility rules
    we are accustomed to in books do not apply. Perhaps Zachary could say something
    about this?\r\n\r\nA new typeface that also has some elements for cartography
    is [[Carl Crossgrove]]'s Beorcana \u2013 http://beorcana.com/"

    the moment I'm reviewing it after a half year of letting it alone, redesigned
    the basic characters. All the others are very inconsistent (best to be seen in
    texts with ligatures on).\r\n\r\nEven if it was finished, it wouldn't be quite
    useful for modern cartography though... But there was this little voice in my
    head, that told me to mention it :-)"

  body: Thanks everybody for the responses.  This gives me a lot of unfamiliar (to
    me) faces to look at, and some good ideas for future map designs.  I'm especially
    keen on Incognito, Gotham Rounded, Beorcana, and Roemisch.
