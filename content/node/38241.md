body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear some comments about an brand I have
  been working on.\r\n\r\nHere is some info about the client, the type of business
  and the work done so far.\r\n\r\nThe brand is new. It is founded by a few young
  designers that want to have their own label.\r\nThe name was given by the clients.
  \r\nThey are not going to make \"haute couture\", but they are not SEARS eather...
  They are aiming for a young audience, with relatively high visual culture, that
  is also willing to pay for the craftsmanship they (Ocean child) provide.\r\nThey
  wanted something that was both young, smooth and free, but a bit corporate and official
  too...\r\n\r\nWell, I'd be glad to answer any questions and to read some comments.\r\nThanks
  in advance for your time :)\r\n\r\n"

    your clients are looking for. \r\n\r\nFrom a practical point of view while the
    business card layout works for a relatively short name what happens when a longer
    name comes along or if e-mail addresses are required?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "The logo itself feels very youthful and free to me and is still credible
    in a corporate sense. I might try scaling \"Child\" down a bit to create a bit
    more contrast between it and \"Ocean\" to see what happens. \r\n\r\nAlso I am
    not sure why there's so much black being shown with the name of the logo- a name
    like that begs for color (if that's a production concern or budget limitation
    then I would reverse black/white on the logo and card). \r\n\r\nNice work."

  body: "Thank you both for your comments! :)\r\n\r\ntimd, would you suggest a different
    global approach to the logo? Any examples may be..?\r\nYou are right about the
    business card, I believe I will have to kill some of the space between the logo
    and the info in order to forecast a longer namer...\r\n\r\nmjpatrick, I was actually
    thinking of doing the \"child\" with a very black type, that would fill up the
    whole circle of each letter. So we'd get something like a \"circular-punch-out\"
    in a way :)\r\nColor has not been discussed yet, however we have agreed that we'll
    be looking at complex colors (pastel, colors you can find in nature's ecosystems
    etc)...\r\nI will post any changes and fixes made!"

  body: The "N" breaks the harmonious shape of the other letters -- and not in a good
    way, I think. I would recommend trying out a lowercase "n".
