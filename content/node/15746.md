  body: Thanks Sebastian. I knew "The Serif" but it doesn't work well for this job.
    I like Egytienne F and it would work but i miss some weights like light und bold
    italic.

  body: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/farao/">Farao</a> has just been
    expanded to a 12-font family. Not necessarily more weights, but more "cuts" (book
    and text with italic).
