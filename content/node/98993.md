body: Hello! I'm taking a solo backpacking trip through Europe in January and February.
  I'll be going through Iceland, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, and Istanbul for
  sure. Other than that, my plans are open. I love typography, and I was wondering
  if anyone had any suggestions for great typography/design sites? I was planning
  a Bauhaus day trip to Dessau, but beyond that I'm not sure. Any suggestions would
  be very much appreciated, thank you!

    Museum]], [[http://www.serpentinegallery.org/|Serpentine Gallery ]] and the [[http://www.vam.ac.uk/|Victoria
    and Albert Museum]]. The V&A opens late on Fridays and it is amazing to have a
    glass of wine and wander around with music playing.

    time in Thessaloniki - its confluence of multiple old and rich cultural traditions
    makes for an amazing experience in visual language.\r\n\r\n* But do be careful:\r\nhttp://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/crime/shock-over-italian-peace-bride-murder-turkey\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In Amsterdam, be sure to visit <a href=\"http://www.nijhoflee.nl/\">Nijhof
    & Lee</a>, the most excellent typography and design bookshop, now located in the
    special collections building of the University of Amsterdam (be aware that Google
    Maps may still point you to the old location, so best to search for 'Bijzondere
    Collecties' to locate the building).\r\n\r\nIn London, the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British
    Library</a> is definitely worth a visit even if you don't have an excuse to get
    a reader card and spend some time doing actual work there. Their well-reviewed
    exhibition of Mughal Indian manuscripts will be on while you are there, and their
    permanent exhibit remains amazing even though I have been there many times.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you know your dates for London, check to see what events might be on at the <a
    href=\"http://stbride.org/events\">St Bride Printing Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.letterexchange.org/\">Letter
    Exchange</a> society; the latter hold their events in an extraordinary Arts &
    Crafts guild house."
