body: "In April of 96 there was a typographic symposium in Toronto with lots of big
  names that I very much wanted to meet and hear. The cost was out of my reach (being
  a type designer will do that) and much to my regret I couldn\u2019t attend. \r\n\r\nThe
  event was on a Friday and Saturday. I consoled myself by going out to a little electronic
  music shindig on Saturday night, and ended up having a phenomenal time. The next
  day I went out for lunch on Queen Street with my friend Jean-Michel from France.
  As we left the restaurant, we hadn\u2019t walked more than two dozen paces, when
  I passed some men speaking Dutch. I figured they were just tourists and kept on
  walking. A few paces on however I realized that I recognized one of them. \u201CWait
  here\u201D I said to my companion and ran back.\r\n\r\n\u201CExcuse me, but are
  you Gerard Unger?\u201D I asked in Dutch. \r\n\u201CYes I am,\u201D he said with
  a rather surprised look on his face. \r\n\u201CHey, and you\u2019re Just van Rossum
  and you\u2019re Erik van Blokland.\u201D \r\n\r\nI introduced myself, explained
  who I was and what I did. We proceeded to stand there and chat for several minutes,
  I showed them what I did, and we exchanged cards. \r\n\r\n\u201CYes Paul Sych was
  telling me about you. If I had known about you before hand I would have snuck you
  into the conference,\u201D Gerard Unger said, much to my chagrin of course. \r\n\r\nBut
  I have to say I thought it was hilarious to meet the three people at the symposium
  I most wanted to meet, completely by chance. If I had left the restaurant thirty
  seconds later, I would have missed them. The other amusing thing is that Just and
  Erik were both born around the same time as me (Just in 1966 and Erik in 1967) are
  both as tall as me (2 meters), they\u2019re Dutch and they design type. \r\n\r\nThey
  inquired where a good place to eat would be, and after discussing the many possibilities,
  I pointed out the direction to a good Indian restaurant. This happened to be in
  the direction where my neglected friend was. He had waited patiently for me this
  whole time. I introduced everyone and Gerard Unger, being a very personable man
  (I think avuncular would be a good term to describe him) asked Jean Michel what
  he did. \r\n\u201CI\u2019m a DJ,\u201D he replied. \r\n\u201CAh, my son is a DJ
  in Amsterdam.\u201D \r\n\u201CI know several DJs from there. I actually played a
  record last night by two guys from Amsterdam, Remy and Sven from Global Cuts.\u201D
  \r\n\u201CAh yes, Remy is my son and Sven is my nephew.\u201D \r\n\r\nMy brain was
  pretty much reeling at this point! One strange small world incident was followed
  by another in rapid succession. \r\n\r\nA while later I got a call from Joe Clark,
  a writer who specializes in design. \r\n\u201CHey I hear you accosted Gerard Unger
  on the street.\u201D \r\n\u201CYeah. How did you know?\u201D \r\n\u201CDavid Michaelides
  from FontShop told me.\u201D \r\n\u201CAnd how did he know?\u201D \r\n\u201CThey
  told David because they were utterly flabbergasted that someone in Toronto not only
  recognized them, but knew who they were, and could speak to them in their native
  tongue.\u201D \r\n\r\nThe next day I was on the phone with Patric from Thirstype.
  \r\n\u201CSo I hear you bumped into the Dutch boys on the street.\u201D \r\n\u201CYeah
  how did you know?\u201D \r\n\u201CJust told me. He thought it was hilarious that
  you knew who they were, and went up to say hello. He said it made him feel like
  a famous rock star.\u201D \r\n\r\nBut it gets even weirder. FontShop published sheets
  with bios and small portfolios of notable type designers. Gerard Unger was one of
  them. It made mention how he got his start at a very famous Dutch ad agency Total,
  run by esteemed typographer Wim Crouwel. I showed this sheet to my mom for her to
  get a sense of who I had met. \r\n\u201COh I know Wim Crouwel,\u201D my mom says.
  \r\n\u201CHuh?! Are you sure?\u201D \r\n\u201CYes your dad used to play baseball
  with him.\u201D (My father was a really good pitcher and played on the Dutch national
  team in the 50s and early 60s.) \u201CYes I\u2019m certain of it, Wim Crouwel, he
  ran an advertising agency. He was a catcher.\u201D \r\n\u201CSo let me get this
  straight. My dad used to lob baseballs at the head of a luminary in the world of
  typography. Wow.\u201D"
