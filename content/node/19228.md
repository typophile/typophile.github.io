  titles in the Balthazar cookbook.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/balth.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  credits say Mucca Designs did the cover, but i think they designed the whole book
  too.\r\nThanks!"

  body: As a designer of many cookbooks, it's hard to imagine someone handtooling
    every recipe title. My guess is either it does exist as is or they had someone
    create it in fontographer. Or they have a bevy of unpaid interns at the studio
    for this kind of work.
