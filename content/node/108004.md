  body: "Might be a font. Might be lettering. \r\nThe design of the swash elements
    is derived mainly from a font produced in 1760 as Caslon Black and now usually
    known as Old English. Too complex for most purposes, but there are simplified
    versions such as this house letters design:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldEnglishHouseLettersSM_4745.jpg]\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "You're welcome Danny. The design is used by a British house number maker
    -- can't recall the url but if you dig with Google it should be findable -- and
    they provide only a very small scale jpeg image to assist buyers. [I increased
    the scale and enhanced it for my post.] Clearly they want to keep the design as
    a business asset.\r\nDon"
