  body: "I haven't seen an italic version before, but this is the same as the freeware
    font <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=batman_forever&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=CHILL+CHAMBER&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=pop\">Batman
    Forever</a>. Maybe the shear was done manually?\r\n\r\nThere is an oblique version
    available of the, imho, superior typeface, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/12998/russellsquareromanoblique-font.html?PHPSESSID=34b93dae0d6ad41803fadb6bbab93932\">Russell
    Square</a> that you might like to look at as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the info and believe me, I'm not looking at this font because
    I love it. Someone wanted something similar in feel for this same company.  Its
    a matter of compromising between the jagged iciness and compressed negative spaces--
    and a superior font.  \r\n\r\nI do know about Russel Square-- but thanks-- it
    is better but not quite right for this project.  I've looked through tons of display
    fonts and couldn't find anything else close.  May be just a matter of modifying
    an existing font for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tips!"
