body: "I am currently working on the OT versions of some Jukebox fonts that will hopefully
  be released soon. The one problem I can't seem to resolve, is why my OT features
  show up correctly in the OpenType dock and work when clicked, but do NOT appear
  in the drop down menu in the Glyph Palette. (These fonts are being tested in Illustrator
  CS4) Other than this they seem to work fine. I've had another OT person look at
  the fonts, but so far he is stumped too. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
