    target="_blank">Coronet&#39;s</a> more attractive sister. <BR> <BR>Looks like
    a Metro underneath, but the &#39;a&#39; is two-storied.

  body: Hmm. Sorry to contradict, guys, but that sans doesn&#39;t  <BR>look like Metro
    to me. Granted, it&#39;s a small sample. But  <BR>the tail of the Metro g continues
    further around the  <BR>curve, and so does the top of the a; the Metro s has  <BR>a
    more closed aperture top and bottom; the Metro w is  <BR>slightly narrower and
    quite idiosyncratic, with unequal  <BR>interior and exterior angles; and the overall
    x-height  <BR>of Metro is proportionately a little larger. <BR> <BR>This looks
    more like an import to me. I&#39;m thinking  <BR>probably Erbar. Unfortunately,
    there are no good online  <BR>samples, as there has not yet been a digitization
    of the  <BR>original Erbar, not that I&#39;m aware of. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    yet? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a sample of Metro from the Typophile&#39;s book on Dwiggins.

  body: Funny, I thought we were trying to ID the masthead font but then I noticed
    all these posts about Metro and figured out everybody was shooting for the teeny
    little font below it. <BR> <BR>Regarding the masthead, it could be Coronet but
    the cap &#39;T&#39; is so home rolled, I wonder if it&#39;s a one off job that
    somebody did a while back to slightly alter Coronet - That &#39;D&#39; is unmistakable.
    <BR> <BR>Now regarding the font below, I got another chuckle since it so closely
    matches my Lionel Family which was inspired by lettering I found in an old Lionel
    Train repair manual. I&#39;m attaching a sample for your consideration. It&#39;s
    my first serious text face and I&#39;m quite fond of it. <BR> <BR>Upon a critique
    by Matthew Carter, he insisted there was no reason for this font to exist because
    Futura already existed :D <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12264.gif"

  body: '&#40;Insert sound of exasperation here&#41; <BR> <BR>Sure, while the Lionel
    lower-case bears a lot of similarity to Futura, the upper-case and numerals have
    a very distinctive &#40;and pleasant&#41; personality. <BR> <BR>And perusing Matthew
    Carter&#39;s faces, especially the slight differences between <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-century-schoolbook/">New
    Century Schoolbook</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/">Miller</a>,
    I think what we have here is a slight case of the pot calling the kettle derivative.'

  body: <i>MSS by WAD</i> was the Typophile Chapbook XVII, 1947.  <BR>&#40;The original
    Typophiles, that is.&#41; But that was pretty  <BR>much just essays by Dwiggins.
    Your Metro sample is  <BR>from page 224 of the second volume from the set of  <BR>Typophile
    Chapbooks XXXV and XXXVI, <i>Postscripts on  <BR>Dwiggins</i>. This was begun
    shortly after WAD&#39;s death  <BR>as a commemorative and was published a couple  <BR>years
    later in 1960. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ll probably be showing images
    of some of WAD&#39;s  <BR>original ink sketches for Metro as part of my TypeCon  <BR>presentation.

  body: Oh, and my guess on that nameplate is that it was  <BR>done up as a logotype
    &#40;original meaning of the word&#41;,  <BR>one piece of metal &#40;maybe a zinc?&#41;,
    based on Coronet,  <BR>but taking advantage of the single piece to make the  <BR>script
    fully connecting. &#40;Look at the ending curves of  <BR>the two n&#39;s -- each
    slightly different.&#41; I suspect that it  <BR>would have been impossible to
    space this tight as a  <BR>font of individual sorts. Even on an angled body. <BR>
    <BR>Middleton designed Coronet for Ludlow in 1937, so  <BR>it would have been
    <i>au courant.</i> <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got a friend who works down at the New York Public  <BR>Library
    as an archivist. She just began work on a recent  <BR>aquisition of a truckload
    of The Typophiles corresponence,  <BR>sketches, chaps etc. She&#39;s made it plain
    that I&#39;m the only  <BR>one who&#39;s allowed to view it once the work is done!
    No,  <BR>share the wealth. I&#39;ll put up an announcement when it&#39;s  <BR>available
    to view. <BR> <BR>Randy

    like it. But for those who are familiar with the older,  <BR>New York Typophiles
    club &#40;they figure prominently in  <BR>the history of mid-20th-century American
    typography  <BR>and printing, with many notable members&#41;, it&#39;s a little  <BR>odd
    to reconcile the similar use of the name. That&#39;s all. <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    the link, John. I knew they were still active.  <BR>Didn&#39;t know they had finally
    put up a site. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    I&#39;ve noticed the masthead was handlettered/illustrated up until they went
    with Avant Garde in the &#39;70s.&#41; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s sad they don&#39;t use
    something like that now instead of trying the WSJ look. My college newspaper uses
    Utopia caps for its banner. Boring.'
