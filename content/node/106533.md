  Fira.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/\r\n\r\nMy
  quick first impression is that I'm not in love with it entirely, but it's nicer
  than Roboto.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OkA2sTx.png\" width=\"100%\"/>"

  body: "A softer, rounder relative of Meta.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit troubled by the size
    example given on the Mozilla style site:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>ZTE Open has 165 pixels
    per inch (ppi) = 72 pt\r\n165ppi / 72 pt = 2.91667px (this how many pixels in
    1 point at device resolution)\r\n\r\nI want my body text to be 8pt, how big would
    that be on a ZTE Open in pixels?\r\n8pt x 2.91667px = 18.33333px\r\n\r\nWe want
    to round up, because bigger type is better. So 8pt is actually 19px on our ZTE
    Open device.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat seems to equate px units with device pixels,
    which ain't so. The CSS px unit is now defined as an absolute length equivalent
    to 1/96th of an inch."
