  body: 'No matter what we do we&#39;re living in a post-modern world. The beauty
    of it is we agree on disagreeing. No matter how &#39;Modernist&#39; a piece of
    work might be, we won&#39;t be seeing it under the same light as our predecessors,
    because our world is not the same any more. So, a so-called &#39;Modernist&#39;
    piece of design is simply a &#39;style&#39; we pick from the &#39;big closet&#39;
    in order to sell something to a particular group of &#39;target audience&#39;,
    who happen to be hip and cool and trendy yuppies. The same goes for &#39;traditionalist&#39;
    designs.  <BR> <BR>I think we not only live in a post-modern world, we also live
    in a multicultural world &#40;at least in this part of the world&#41;. That even
    renders so-called &#39;movements&#39; like Post-modernism and/or Modernism at
    best redundant, or at worst, meaningless. It&#39;s time to lose the &#39;isms&#39;
    and focus more on what we are supposed to do: to communicate visually. As long
    as we keep our goal in mind, and to continue to be passionate about what it is
    that we&#39;re doing, then we&#39;ll be alright.  <BR> <BR>I have two opposing
    views about typography: one of which is that typography is first and foremost
    about communicating the textual content as efficiently as possible; the other
    is utilizing the semantics of type to give design work particular &#39;atmospheres&#39;
    or emotional responses. The first one is based on linguistic requirements and
    it&#39;s what &#39;traditional&#39; &#40;book&#41; typography was &#40;is&#41;
    all about. The latter is based on visual requirements, which is what graphic design
    is about, mostly. Of course, these two views are not mutually exclusive and it
    is up to us to strike a balance between the two <BR> <BR>- Keith Chi-Hang Tam
