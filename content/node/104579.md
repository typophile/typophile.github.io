  around here. I've been surviving off the basics: Helvetica, Univers, Gill Sans,
  Sabon, etc. I want to get at least a dozen new display typefaces that bring us at
  least into the last decade. Would love some HF&J action, as well as some smaller
  foundries.\r\n\r\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? I'd love to here what
  you ended up doing. TBH I don't even know where to start. I guess a budget. Is $5K
  enough?"

    as they occurred.\r\nAlthough once in while I would get something that really
    intrigued me.\r\nIsn\u2019t it better to try out fonts for a new project, having
    the entire universe of fonts at your disposal, rather than being limited to what\u2019s
    on hand?\r\nThe downside to this strategy is that there are advantages to working
    with familiar tools.\r\nAlso, if you have crowd-pleasers such as Gotham, it does
    make one\u2019s designs more attractive, although at the expense of sameness.\r\n\r\nAt
    the moment, some foundries offer huge discounts on new releases, so you might
    \uFB01gure that into your plans."

  body: Thanks for your thoughts, Nick. That is a very tempting strategy, however,
    we need a group of fonts to share across designers, teams, etc. I think I'll just
    have to come up with a short list of hard-working, crowd-pleasers, etc.

    creating, and hence categories of fonts by use.

    number of users permitted with the license. A few -- such as H&FJ you mention,
    start with one computer & the price goes up with each additional station. More
    common is a basic license that covers 5 computers. --Though not always, which
    is why you should check.\r\n\r\nAlso, some companies favor bundling of fonts --
    you buy a package for a fairly stiff price. Not always a very good bargain.  Sometimes
    that's the only way to get anything from that publisher, sometimes you can buy
    individual fonts.\r\n\r\nListen to Nick. His strategy will save your company money
    over time. And if the world works the way it should, saving your company money
    will pay off for you, too."

    budget, or a lousy one.
