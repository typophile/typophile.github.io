  no other area of visual culture is so ubiquitous and yet so invisible as typography.
  In everyday life, typography is looked through, rather than at. In Ireland, certain
  styles of lettering have come to be associated with \u2018Irishness\u2019, whether
  \u2018authentic\u2019 or \u2018fake\u2019. On directional road signs, posters, book
  covers, murals, monuments, newspapers, packaging shop-fronts and buildings, the
  role of lettering in the construction of Irishness is evident in a vast range of
  objects. In tracing the development and mediation of Irish cultural and national
  identity through the use of \u2018Irish\u2019 lettering and typographic styles,
  this lecture aims to examine the historical means by which such forms became the
  dominant and \u2018natural\u2019 way to write \u2018Irishness\u2019. The Irish language
  is a fundamental term in the discourse of Irish national identity, yet its visual
  manifestation is often over looked. Through the course of the evening, Clare and
  Mary Ann will explore how the visual representation of one language can be \u2018translated\u2019
  into another. They look at how typography enhances the symbolic utility of language
  as a conduit for myth, and for the demarcation of religious and cultural difference
  in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\r\n\r\nMary Ann Bolger MIDI
  MA (RCA) runs the historical and theoretical elements of the BA (Hons) Degree in
  Design (Visual Communications) at Waterford Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\nClare
  Bell, designer, researcher and lecturer in typography, received her primary degree
  at Central St Martins in London and worked as a designer at the Guardian newspaper
  before returning to Dublin.\r\n=====\r\n\r\nMichael Everson * http://www.evertype.com\r\n\r\n"
