  body: 'Angela, this is a great topic! And the links mentioned above already cover
    a lot of ground. <BR> <BR>The one caution I would state early on is this: be careful
    to keep functionality always in sight - avoid turning things into self-serving
    formal aesthetic exercises. <BR> <BR>BTW, the &#34;g&#34; in Analogue makes me
    think you should be designing type. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Wow thats a great link Grant! <BR> <BR>How come i didn&#39;t know about this
    one?  <BR>Good thing with Meeks&#39;s auto font maker is that the output is usable.
    &#40;well for display copy anyway&#41;

    be hard to find work of this quality just using google searches. These are some
    really interesting projects and I especially appreciate seeing the different interfaces
    that have been used to present the typefaces. Thanks again! '
