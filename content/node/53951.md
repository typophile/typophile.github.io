  body: "Bunsen burner comes to mind initially. When scaled down its hard to distinguish
    the thumb from the finger line, maybe bring it up a point size or two.\r\n\r\nIt
    all looks rather flat as well. Maybe bring in some gradients on the leaf to add
    a bit of depth and perhaps scale the leaf up so it over laps the circle.\r\n\r\nTypographically
    the two faces work well together, be good to see some other variations tho.\r\n\r\nOverall
    a decent marque up till now, just a bit more experimentation needed!"

    Some people here may take this <i>honesty thing</i> offensive.\r\n\r\nAnd I'd
    like to say that your design already shows its weakness. Small size problems.
    Thumb lines are lost, text isn't readable and I also think that font choice of
    GESAC doesn't complement mark very well. But this last thing is barely my taste.
    They may as well go together well.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "Typically the gradient and the colors are secondary to the actual geometry
    of the mark. There are some notable exceptions of course, but your case is not
    one of them. So I'd gather the feedback regarding the B/W version of the mark
    first, and fine-tune the color treatment and such second.\r\n\r\nIn this context
    I think the original version is not bad. I would consider using uniform thickness
    for the circling line. Additionally, one way to avoid a loss of a thumb detail
    at small scale is to do something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hand_5891.png]\r\n\r\n.\r\nHowever
    in general the mark is a little to bland. As someone else said regarding some
    of my own work  - \"it doesn't have an AHA moment\". At very least, the mark is
    reminiscent of WWII memorials you can find in (Eastern) Europe - two hands guarding
    fragile eternal flame representing a memory of fallen solders. \r\n\r\nAs a suggestion
    - try and use the negative space you have within the circle. For example, have
    a look at [[http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/48073|this logo]] and see how it
    has three related concepts seamlessly blended into a single mark."

  body: "Michael in which statement was I hostile? the first part of my post was just
    saying that screaming at people to be honest isn't very good. Because I think
    we are honest here giving our point of view on someone else's work.\r\n\r\nSo
    the first part couldn't be. Because it's not a critique of the mark. It has to
    be the second part. And in the second part I was being honest. I pointed out small
    size problems with thin line and small text. Which is true. The part where mark
    doesn't complement type was my opinion as I also pointed it out.\r\n\r\nI really
    can't see where was I hostile?\r\n\r\nBut it's true I didn't say anything positive.
    Like colour combination. I normally like green/blue logo combination. But colours
    should come to play after BW mark is working.\r\n\r\nAnd I also think that green
    leaf is a tad too close to hands in the new design. But legibility has improved.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "The first thing that came to my mind was \"there's probably something really
    cool you could do with the negative space here\".\r\n\r\nThe font choice is very
    bland (is that TNR with the 'G' modified?). I'd go with something that complements
    the leaf/flame shape. If you're stuck without a budget, try using Fertigo Pro,
    Fontin, or Diavlo from exljbris.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. Alex - I count at least
    five things going on in that thrive logo. Very nifty."

  body: "lateblues, the logo has an interesting idea that's not being executed as
    well as it should be. It smacks of too much computer thinking and not enough print
    and sketch thinking. The details on the thumbs and the type are just too small.
    Print it out at the size you would use it for a business card and letterhead to
    see what I mean. The details and the type will disappear or turn into 'ant tracks'.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest more curves in the hands to make them more hand-like. Think about the
    leaf/flame thing. Is this what you want? Also, the relative size of the leaf to
    the hands: Are the hands protecting the huge leaf? Are they supporting it? Are
    they avoiding touching it? In a logo, every line communicates, so be aware of
    it. Try shifting the relative sizes and see how it changes the message.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    as others have said, choose type with more warmth or more personality. GESAC looks
    authoritative, but it also looks too bureaucratic next to the mark. The sans serif
    type is just too small and is not well paired with the serif type. If you're a
    student, I know your options are limited, but these are not strong type choices.
    They should have a harmony or a purposeful contrast with the mark. Right now,
    they look like they just happened to be in the same place.\r\n\r\nAll this being
    said, there's a strong mark at the core. You can develop this and make it work.
    It does look like some other logos I've seen, but for student work it's more important
    to explore and understand the craft and concepts than it is to get worried about
    similarities (short of looking like a rip-off, of course).\r\n\r\nKeep trying
    and keep exploring. Go to a site like FontShop and poke around their hand-picked
    fonts for inspiration. Also, try looking at <a href=\"http://students.umf.maine.edu/~ouellecj/webquest/handsdirt.jpeg.jpg\">images
    like this one</a> and figure out what they have that your mark does and doesn't.
    Use these explorations to start fresh on the same approach."

    try liner as well.\r\n\r\nAll the type is too tight, loosen things up a bit.\r\n\r\nThe
    global environmental on top is not working and is out of place.\r\n\r\nexperiment
    with different typefaces! and justification- try justified left.\r\n\r\nI like
    the leaf overlapping the circle, but you enlarged it a tad too much - bring it
    away from the hands a tad.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above get the mono logo working
    first then add a lick of paint.\r\n\r\nKeep going its coming along . . . "

  body: "While the hands may well be the whole point of the logo, in none of the examples
    do they read as hands.  Look at hands. Study some anatomy. Draw it without a computer.
    Find a good source image, trace it realistically and slowly abstract and simplify
    the forms.  \r\n\r\nThen see if it reads at 1/4\" at 72 dpi, the most unfortunate
    restriction that designers have ever been handed."

    work with - the space between the hands and the outer circle looks to me as an

    fingers need at least a slight curvature, and this would make them relate nicely
    to the curvature of the leaf shape.\r\n\r\nI'd also use a 'greenier blue' if that
