body: "Hello.\r\nI am on a mac and using fontlab 4.5\r\nI have added in four extra
  characters with the generate glyphs:\r\n\r\nT comma uppercase & lowercase\r\nS comma
  uppercase & lowercase\r\n( the characters with a comma centered under them)\r\n\r\nThey
  had no naming as far as unicode goes once it made them so I typed in the correct
  values the glyph properties. They still do not show up.\r\n\r\nIs there a something
  that I need to indicate in the font info area? Like language support? or make it
  a unicode font. I have run out of ideas...\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\n"

    They still do not show up\r\n\r\nWhere? Fontlab? Or you've generated the font
    and the characters you've added don't show up in the applications you're using?"

      do not appear when typing in applications. Any for that matter. I've even converted
      my computer to Romanian and I get the same thing. They do however appear in
      the glyphs palette and exist in the font.\r\n\r\nWhen making a multi-language

      it doesn't seem to want to recognize both sets. \r\n0162, 0162 vs. 021A, 021B.
      It won't accept 021A, 021B\r\n\r\nTo make it more confusing it worked once in

    do a search on your computer and trash all the files named \"AdobeFnt.lst\"."

    do, but most have to build up their experience just like you: trial and error,
    and a lot of thread reading/posting.\r\n\r\nAnd, in case it makes you feel any
    better, even type foundries face problems... so don't despair :^)\r\n\r\nLike
