    Winter.  We definitely have wuss Winters here for sure but the place gets crippled
    at the prediction of a flake falling.  They close schools here if snow becomes
    a category on the Jeopardy TV show! This was actually the first snow of the season
    here and it is mid February!\r\nYou guys can have it all and ski your brains out

    Looks pretty wet, so I'd say not below -2 \xB0C?\r\n\r\nLast week we had a nice
    layer of new snow and it was -14 \xB0C or so, just warmer than the border for
    the kids not to go skiing/skating at the school PE lesson."
