  appreciate it.  I'd rather not scan as the quality won't be as good.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    you'd like to imitate?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Tami, what is your teacher trying to teach you through this project? Did
    they give you a paragraph of intent? I'd be curious to know what you are supposed
    to be learning from it. Most magazines use custom typefaces or typefaces which
    are going to cost money. I don't understand why a teacher would assign this project.
    Did they tell you to match the typefaces?\r\n\r\nThis is nothing against you Tami.

  body: "I have a similar issue, our instructor wants us to use found body copies
    that work for our assignments.  I have developed a sweet spot for the serif typefaces
    used in W magazine...  I might be crazy but I like the feel of their bold and
    regular serifs on my resume... I just can't figure out what they are.  I don't
    think they are the same font either.  Every time I get close on a font finder,
    it's still not quite right.  They remind me of Bembo,  and a search I came up
    with was Hoeffler Text or versions of garamond but, I just dont think they are
    quite right. I am also wondering exactly what the san serif font they use in the
    inside is for body and subheads.     \r\n\r\nI'm just so frusterated in this search.
    \ If anyone could help me, I would greatly appreciate it. "
