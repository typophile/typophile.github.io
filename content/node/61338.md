  body: "Thanks Jimmy\r\n\r\nThat's kind of how I saw it. Just something to live by
    itself, proclaiming I AM \"B.\"\r\n\r\nIs it worth cleaning up? Certainly need
    to alter the left and middle counterspaces to match their end points to that of
    the stroke. \r\n\r\nShould I attempt a more traditional counter on the right side
    of the letter?\r\n\r\nThe problem I was seeing was this:\r\n\r\nI like the two
    rectangular pieces on the right side, since they match the giant rectangle on
    the left of the letter.\r\n\r\nMaybe a very subtle curve on the right side of
    the counters wouldn't eat into that rectangle too much, and possible fix the problem
    of the bottom counterform currently looking like it was just thrown in there.\r\n\r\nThoughts?
    Suggestions? Since it's display I know you can't be telling me to start changing
    the whole thing, that maybe whatever I do it will still be correct (since it's
    more art than anything)--but i do want this puppy to look good. "

  body: "Don't cry -- it's not half bad or something!\r\nDisplay type comes close
    to appreciating art -- people tend to like it or they don't. I, for one, liked
    it at first sight -- even though I didn't immediately recognize it as a letter
    'B' :-D\r\n\r\nI do get the distinct feeling it may look better with slightly
    (or extremely) thinner connecting curves on the top and bottom, making that massive
    centerpiece more afloat in free space (\"connected only with a few tendrils\";
    poetry like that). Perhaps it's an optical illusion that the rounded ends stick
    out above and below -- you might want to experiment with that."
