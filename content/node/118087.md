  body: There's enough variation in Dancing Deer to make me think it's hand-drawn
    and custom, not a font.

  body: "\"variation\" is a good keyword, as \"DANCING DEER...\" looks close to <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=T-26&ffam=Variator%20One%20-%20Regular&fid=f05409759aa1a09b0de284fa7b7237be&fsize=48&text=dancing%20deer%20bak%20DANCING%20DEER%20BAK&wrap=2|Variator
    One]]</strong> from T-26 - but it's not an exact match (modified?).\r\nThis font
    is part of a old package (Variator One/Two/Three) but I can't find it anymore
    (either on MyFonts.com or in T-26 site), I don't know why."
