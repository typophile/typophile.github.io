  Observer</a>\r\n\r\nI like hand-drawn type, but hate the illegibility that can threaten
  an otherwise personal style. As a result, I love texts that are based on typefaces,
  but have hand qualities. I love including this technique in my work - taking a typeface
  and putting my personal hand into it to give it an extra dimension. Both of these
  pieces have that feeling to them - the feeling of taking a typeface and making it
  have personal layer."
