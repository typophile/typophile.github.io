  weeks.\r\nI didn't open Fontlab since december 16th and yesterday i wanted to work
  again on a multiple master font which i created 2 months ago. Everything is working
  fine until the point where i want to adjust the kerning. When i change a figure
  in the kerning table, fontlag suddenly crashes.\r\nThis is just happening with MM-files,
  when i want to open a normal .vfb FontLab still works fine.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  this Problem.\r\n\r\nOn my system there was just one change. The Installer wanted
  to update Java for Mac OsX.\r\nI'm working with MaxOS 10.5.8.\r\n\r\nI really don't
  know what happened the last two weeks."

    Kerning in an MM font using <cite>any</cite> method (entering numbers, dragging,
    etc.).\r\n\r\nThe only workaround I found was to create single master fonts, kern
    them, export an AFM for each and re-import the kerning in the MM font.\r\nNote
    that, when importing a single master AFM, only the currently active master is
    affected so you can update the kerning for individual masters."
