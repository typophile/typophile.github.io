  body: "You may very likely find overall similar typefaces, but these slightly bellied/bulgy/curved
    characters [see the verticals] sure scream (weirdly) custom/ised. They also seem
    to use \u2018<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/clan-pro/?refby=dav\"
    target=\"_blank\">FF Clan (Extended)</a>\u2019, by \u0141ukasz Dziedzic, for their
    \u2018Luxury Hotels\u2019 tagline, so the logo may be \u2018customised\u2019 Clan,
    as well."

  body: "Dav, I imagine that the downvotes were indicators that people disagreed with
    your analysis, not that they thought you were wrong to try to help.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,
    this may show a weakness in the simple upvote/downvote system, compared to other
    approaches."

  body: "Appreciate the help here, but let's make sure we direct these posts to the
    Type ID section. The first time a user posts Type ID to the wrong place, they
    get a personal message directing them to the proper place. Repeat posters may
    find themselves with suspended accounts. We gotta channel this activity, or it'll
    overrun Typophile as it did a year ago. Let's rally together on this!\r\n\r\nInterestingly
    enough, the multiple downvotes does a good job to show Typophile admins and moderators
    those posts/comments that need attention. While the \"meaning\" may be ambiguous,
    it does give the community a tool to help sift signal from noise. \r\n\r\n"
