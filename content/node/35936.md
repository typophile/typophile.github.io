    characters ever made and there are some people (like me)\r\nthat do believe he
    was inspired by someone up above..\r\n\r\nThis is how I see it.\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g_6704.gif]"

    Jenson\r\n\r\nThis document was translated into English by Pierce Butlerbook of
    the Newberry Library in November, 1928. Ludlow printed the will and sent it out
    customers as a promotional piece, including the statement \"[Set] in a trial font
    of sixteen point Nicolas Jenson, a new type designed by Ernst Detterer, interpreting
    as faithfully as possible the original roman type of Jenson, and printed in a
    limited edition on Rives paper by the Ludlow Typograph Company of Chicago in the
    month of November, 1928.\"\r\n&lt; KNIP &gt;\r\nHere endeth the Last Will and
    Testament of the late Nicolas Jenson, Printer, who departed this Life at the City
    of Venice, in the month of September, A.D. 1480. Which Will is preserved in Authentic
    Copy among the Archives of that Noble City.\r\n</em>\r\nhttp://www.pbtweb.com/eusebius/appendix/njwill.html\r\nEdit:

  body: "A couple of years ago I received a grant to do some research on Jenson and
    while I don't have my notes with me I remember enough to know that Jenson's punches,
    matrices and type are nowhere to be found. The will directs them to a Messer Peter,
    but only on the condition that Peter paid 400 ducets for all of Jenson's equipment
    (etc.), and if I remember correctly this purchase didn't go all that smoothly.\r\n\r\nI
    do remember some very vague rumours suggesting that the punches ended up in the
    hands of Aldus Manutius & Griffo, but I can't recall the chain that led from Jenson
    to Aldus, and it sounded more or less like conjecture anyway."
