  cut the type and/or whether there's a good digital typeface based on it, that would
  be great! Otherwise, suggestions of the most similar typefaces you can think of
  are very welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dehumani1_5002.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dehumani2_4631.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dehumani3_4397.png]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Oh, I'd love to get some more background knowledge about this type too!\r\n\r\nA
    snippet of context \u2013 Oporin (Latin: Oporinus; Oporini is the genitive) was
    one of the Basel printers, working out of a building that still stands incidentally.
    He was a student of Froben's, arguably the most important Basel printer of the
    early 16th century. \r\n\r\nI have a few more photos of the same book here, in
    case it helps (some closeups of both the Roman and Italic):\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/sets/72157616517306105/\r\n\r\nThe
    German Wikipedia has some info on Oporinus ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Oporinus
    ) and also links to some more photos of the Vesalius book here (but this is less
    focused on getting the type large): http://quod.lib.umich.edu/w/wantz/vesd1.htm"

  body: "Oh wait a second \u2013 jp romo, where exactly are your photos from, might
    this be a later edition* or a reprint or something? I just realized the type is
    quite different from the one in my shots (which are of the original, I believe
    the first edition). \r\nSorry if I caused confusion.\r\n\r\n[* Jelmar noted <a
    href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3430816682/in/set-72157616517306105/\">here</a>
    that there was a second edition with different type.]"
