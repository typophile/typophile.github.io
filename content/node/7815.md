body: hello everybody, <BR> <BR>a few months ago I asked for your help with my graduationproject,
  a peacefont combining Arabic and Hebrew styles &#40; <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=prev&amp;topic=4100&amp;page=50579"
  target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=prev&amp;topic=4100&amp;page=50579</a>
  &#41;. Thanx for all you help, it was a great succes, I graduated in June and my
  typeface &#40;even though it&#39;s not completely finished&#41; has been published
  in the german Spatium magazine. <BR>Since my graduation I have taken some time off
  to travel, but I will be back at the end of januari. I would like to start looking
  for an internship in designing typefaces, typography. I was thinking of an internship
  of 6 months to a year, anywhere in the world. I feel like I still have a lot to
  learn about typography &#40;there was only a little part of typography in my course
  in college&#41;, but I&#39;m a fast learner. I have a little portfoliowebsite, nothing
  too special, but it will give you an idea of my work during college, <a href="http://users.pandora.be/inebeerten"
  target="_blank">http://users.pandora.be/inebeerten</a> . It  hasn&#39;t been updated
  since I&#39;ve been travelling so the news-part is probably a little outdated. <BR>Maybe
  interesting to know, my first languages are Dutch and English, then French and I
  also speak a little Spanish. <BR> <BR>So if anybody has some good ideas on how I
  could get such an internship or if anybody is looking for somebody to do an internship,
  please let me know... <BR> <BR>thanx, <BR> <BR>Ine

  body: 'Ine, I would encourage you to be very proactive in your search for an internship.
    Our industry is very small, and you should send letters to everyone. <BR> <BR>There
    are bigger font houses, smaller font houses &#40;sometimes with just one or two
    people&#41; and graphic design agencies who do typographic work and/or design
    type, too. I&#39;ve met people who&#39;ve interned at, or heard that internships
    exist, at least all of the following places: <BR> <BR>Linotype, Monotype, FontShop,
    Adobe, DaltonMaag, Xplicit, Meta, Porchez Typofonderie, Luc&#40;as&#41; Fonts,
    Font Bureau, H&amp;FJ, Gal'

    we&#39;ve taken on people in the past for specific projects &#40;Adam Twardoch
    spent six months with us a few years ago&#41;. I can offer some advice though:
    be sure to advertise any technical skills you may have &#40;and not just with
    font software&#41;, and also language skills.'

    years - last one we had here was Andy Crewdson in 2000. But we may be able to
    open a position for next summer. If so I&#39;ll post a note back here. Sadly MS
    does not accept applications from non-US citizens who are not attending US colleges.  <BR>

  body: Ine, another question that I have for you is what sort of place you&#39;d
    like to work at, and what exactly you&#39;d like to do &#40;meaning, is your dream
    job working as a letter drawer in a small type studio, something totally different,
    etc.&#41;.

  body: ok, thank you all.  <BR>I will send letters to different fonthouses. Do you
    think it would be better to send a printed letter with a little printed portfolio?
    It &#39;s kind of hard for me to do at the moment as I&#39;m travelling, I can
    only send emails right now. So it would have to wait untill february. <BR>It&#39;s
    also a little hard for me to say what really is my dreamjob. I think it would
    be really nice to work in a small type studio working as a letter drawer, but
    I think I would be equally happy to work in a bigger studio as a graphic designer,
    doing a little bit of typo once in a while... I can&#39;t really say which I prefer.
