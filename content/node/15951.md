  months that I've been querying this font on the internet. You folks are the best
  so I'm sure you'll know what it is.\r\n\r\nIt's the typeface that is used on the
  packaging for Diane Von Furstenberg the fashion designer. I think I saw the font
  used in a project by www.practise.co.uk that I saw in a book on typography. Of course,
  going to their site, I couldn't find the font in use BUT discovered another one
  that I love that was used for their project about Joseph Beuys. Anyone know what
  that one is as well? \r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\nB"

  body: "Thank you everyone. Frieze is amazingly close to the DvF logo font. I'm so
    delighted! \r\nIn my search on the Practise site (thank you Stephen for the quote...uhh,
    I guess I didn't look hard enough!) I was quite struck by the Tate Modern typeface.
    I think something like it is used in a daily, youth-oriented Toronto newspaper
    called Dose. I suppose it's high on the hipster list now! \r\nThanks again.\r\nB"
