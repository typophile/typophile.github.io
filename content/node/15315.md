body: "Yesterday I downloaded the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType for OS X
  and followed the instructions installing it. The installation was fine but the tools
  did not work.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the AFDKO all my Adobe CS2 applications stop
  working. Acrobat 7 starts up, but after 10 seconds it crashes. Photoshop crashes
  while loading the Font List. The rest of the CS2 apps crash even before the splash
  screen appears.\r\n\r\nI deleted all the prefs, repaired permissions, cleared the
  font cahce without any luck. Then I deactivated all the fonts and used Font Doctor
  to check the system fonts. FD found some problems and fixed them except for one
  font which I removed. But the problem did not change.\r\n\r\nAnybody know how to
  solve this problem?"

  body: It turned out the problem was with the Arial and TimesNewRoman fonts. I removed
    the TT fonts and activated the OTF fonts and now everything works fine.
