  body: Thanks. I agree on the script, Bellevue is the right one. However, Utopia
    italic differs slightly from the font in question. If you look closely at the
    lowercase &#34;v&#34;, you can probably spot it.. Suggestions?

  body: Most of the characters in the large italic sample match the shapes of Bellevue,
    except for being a bit heavier overall--but that is easily done with a stroke
    or just a result of overinking. The characters that don&#39;t match--H, L, and
    v--would have been easy enough to modify. Certain characters--the a, e, t, and
    especially the j--match so closely to Bellevue &#40;except for the heaviness&#41;
    that I have to think that this is actually the case. <BR> <BR>I think the reversed
    text is definitely Utopia, though.
