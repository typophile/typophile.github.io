body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone might have an idea for a typeface
  that would be similar to the infamous \"planet kosmos\", something a bit in the
  idea of house industries' \"bullet\".\r\nThat would mean a bit like \"A\" or \"O\"
  with parallel bars and rounded corners, etc.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions will be appreciated,\r\n\r\nPaul

  body: Why not use "Bullet"? What about <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=trademarker&site=d&btnG=Go">FF
    Trademarker</a>?

  body: I actually thought about trademarker, but I kind of like the idea of parallel
    slopes almost everywhere(ie on "A" and "O" for example) as it allows for pretty
    tight(read condensed) results with a very "square"-ish look.
