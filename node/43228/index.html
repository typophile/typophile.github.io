Its about google map and panoramas etc. I need to point out that I am not a designer i am a programmer, so any kind of critique wold be more than welcomed. The concept is an infowindow and camera. this is the basic forms in black and white.<img src="/images/old-images/black_4560.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In blue:

<p>If the site is a personal blog, etc it may be okay to design something yourself. I&rsquo;d say the middle row in the blue is your strongest. If it&rsquo;s at all business related, however&hellip; if there&rsquo;s any money involved, I&rsquo;d say hire a designer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to offend you, but I am curious why you&rsquo;ve decided to try your hand at graphic design?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for your input Maverick. Well i would like to be critiqued because that&rsquo;s the only way i could learn something new. I just wanted to know how a designer would see these concepts from their point of view.</p>
<p>Yes the website is business related its about marketing of firms in my country(Macedonia) using google maps, If i lived in a diferent country i would hired a designer but in my country there arent any good designers and the mentality is so diferent(if I hired a designer he would probably search the net and he would save the first image that he finds, with 360 on it and sell it to me as a logo). Further more my budget is small so i cant afford some freelance designer.
So thats why i figured out since i know to work very well with Illustrator, Corel, and Photoshop i give it a try.</p>
<p>I can make wonderfull cheese web 2.0 effects with photoshop but i wanted something different. 
P.S
Sorry if my english is poor it&rsquo;s not my native language.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the reply Jupiter Boy.  I was more worried if it could be recognizable by my clients, (the camera and the info window - not to be mistaken by a speech bubble) so I had to incorporate to many elements. None of the elements were recognized by my potential customers:( (This is all so new to them, so i figured out its a nice business to start) 
Anyway you do make a great point and ill give it a try and post the modifications.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;I just wanted to know how a designer would see these concepts from their point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a designers perspective, all these logos are very bad. The concepts need to be heavily refined and simplified, and the implantation needs to be absolutely overhauled. A designer giving you their honest opinion would suggest that you hire a professional.</p>
<p>You may not have a large budget, but the identity of your company is one of the most important investments you can make. When you have an online business your logo is the face of your company. People will make judgements because of your design that directly influence weather they choose you or your competitor.</p>
<p>There are plenty of inexperienced student designers who are very inexpensive. If there aren&rsquo;t any in your country you can outsource the project to someone from another country. Another option is to hold a design contest where people compete for your prize money. <a href="http://99designs.com">http://99designs.com</a> is a good site.</p>
<p>I hope I didn&rsquo;t offend you with my blunt honesty. Your english is very good by the way.</p>

<p>That is awful advice after you first suggest hiring a professional. Professionals and those that would enter design contests are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>As for the logos, I think these are all decent ideas, and just need to be simplified/refined a bit.</p>
<p>I think the first one has the most potential, but needs a lot of polish. Perhaps fewer lines. More geometric typeface.</p>
