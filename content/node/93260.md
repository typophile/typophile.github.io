  Polke: Supermarkets aus dem Zyklus \u201EWir Kleinb\xFCrger!\u201C, 1976\r\nGouache,

  VG Bild-Kunst\r\n\r\nIn 1963, along with Gerhard Richter and Konrad Fischer (Konrad
  Leug as he was also known), Polke founded the painting movement, Capital Realism.
  The movement championed the pictorial short hand found in advertising, with subject
  matter often commenting on the consumer driven capitalist mode adopted by western
  civilization. \r\n\r\nThis work can easily be said to be a forerunner of the modern
  graffiti movement. Done in '76 but in the midst of what was started in '63 as Capital
  Realism I am hard pressed to find an earlier work which is so identifiable with
  today's graff artist - especially those who have gravitated to gallery acceptance.
  \ I supposed one could look to Warhol but ... I don't know for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n"
