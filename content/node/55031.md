body: "That\u2019s right you heard correct it is bad type, and unfortunately I have
  to say the guilty party are repeat offenders, guilty of one thing and one thing
  only, creating rivers and valleys in their type. The type has fallen victim to the
  act of justifying type without adjustment of letter spacing. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rivers_5289.jpg]\r\n(
  you can almost imagine a ball flowing through the rivers in this text, like a pinball
  machine)\r\n\r\nWhy is this such a horrible offense you ask?\r\n Because it creates
  a terrible valley in the line of communication. The readers eye now has too much
  room to breathe and is left to fend for themselves without a solid direction or
  guide. The eye falls and rests abruptly when rivers and valleys are created in the
  type.\r\n\r\nHow is \u201Cgood\u201D type different?\r\nGood typography would enable
  the reader to read and absorb the information at a steady pace. Enabling a clear
  line of communication. Good type would not be overcrowded, it would maintain the
  appropriate number of characters per line, as well as create proportionate letter
  spacing.\r\n\r\nWhat do you deem to be \u201Cgood\u201D type? and just for the sake
  of asking what do you label as \u201Cbad\u201D type? post examples!"
