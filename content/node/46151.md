  body: "Is there a difference between Times Roman and Times New Roman?\r\nI'm comparing
    the poster fonts to Times New Roman, and they seem a tad different.\r\nIf I leave
    it un-bold, the letters (and especially the serifs) seem a bit thin. If I use
    Bold Times New Roman, the thicker parts of the letter seem too thick, while the
    thin parts of the letter still seem too thin.\r\nSorry to be picky, but is there
    any other possibility?\r\nThanks!\r\n-ThaiBinh"
