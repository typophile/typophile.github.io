  body: "It seems that there could be many candidates for this, partly because these
    words have very few helpful letterforms besides the S, C and G. There are 225
    sans families with a roughly similar G style in my Sans Guide (so there are quite
    a few more in actuality, since that Guide is about 4 years behind, and Sans styles
    have been most popular text releases recently). Some of the closer choices: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/absara-sans/|Absara
    Sans]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lucasfonts/lf-corpid-iii/|Corpid]] (widened),
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/formata-be/|Formata]], [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_sans/sans_bold.html|Foundry
    Sans Bold]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-profile/|FF Profile]],
    [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/themix_basic/?&sample_text=SLOW%20CLOTHING&update=0|TheMix]],
    or [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/thesans_basic/?&sample_text=SLOW%20CLOTHING&update=0|TheSans]].\r\n\r\nI
    think the three Lucas Fonts choices probably would be about the closest, especially
    the last two.\r\n\r\nIf you had more letters it might be easier to eliminate the
    wrong ones.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
