    v. crap, collectible v. recyclable/disposable.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it extra cool
    for me, I'm originally from Wisconsin. Kudos to my peeps!"

    in St. Paul. Gerry printed some of his woodcuts and I think we ran at least one
    piece of his in the magazine I was art directing at the time. Stockholm (Wisconsin)
    is also a cool place. Very tiny. '

    WI?\r\n\r\nwww.woodtype.org\r\n\r\nIt's an absolute gem. I've only had the opportunity
    to visit it one time, but hopefully, I'll be able to this December when we're
    back in WI for Christmas."
