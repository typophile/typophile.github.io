body: I hope I&#39;m posting this in the right area. Moderator, please move if this
  is incorrect. I was advised by a Mac forum to ask this question here so I&#39;m
  hoping you guys can help. I&#39;ve just switched from a PC to a Mac and was wondering
  if there is anything akin to shortcuts to fonts for the Mac. On my PC, I used to
  organize my font collection by foundry and then if I needed to install a font, I
  simply pointed windows to where it was located. The font wasn&#39;t copied to the
  system fonts folder and thus didn&#39;t result in a duplicate font somewhere I didn&#39;t
  know about. With OS X, I&#39;ve tried using font book &#40;but I&#39;m admittedly
  new at it&#41; and using collections but this still results in the font being copied
  from its original location &#40;my organized folders&#41; to a fonts folder under
  my username. Is there something akin to shortcuts to fonts on a Mac?

  body: Font book is not a great software but I haven&#39;t used it much. I recommend
    Font Reserve. When you add a font to Font Reserve it gives you the option of leaving
    it where it is or copying it into this dumb thing called the Vault. It will not
    copy your font into the system folder. Font Reserve also has nice perks like a
    character map which is surprisingly missing from Font Book.  <BR> <BR>Organizing
    by foundry is interesting... I just do it alphabetically. Easier for me to find
    them.

  body: Switcher, like Patrica I use Font Reserve. I trashed  font book as a piece
    of junk on my computer. I didn&#39;t want conflicts. OS system of fonts can be
    very confusing especially if you use Illustrator CS. It took me awhile to find
    the duplicate fonts.

  body: Well, I kept Font Book, waiting for a better interface coming out from the
    depths of Apple&#39;s HI group. I used to be a Font reserve user, gave Suitcase
    a try too. But I found out that I have better things to do with my RAM and computing
    power than to spend it senselessly to managing my fonts, I only have couple of
    hundreds installed, so no big deal for font book as I found. <BR> <BR>I have to
    admit that this is totally up for personal taste.

  body: 'I use FontBook, too. I&#39;ve used Suitcase, ATM Deluxe, and Font Reserve
    in the past, but I don&#39;t think they are as essential as they used to be. If
    I needed auto-activation I would consider one of the current third-party font
    managers, but I found that with OS X, they were more trouble than they were worth,
    at least for me. <BR> <BR>You can avoid most of your font headaches if you avoid
    Classic. Classic really throws a wrench in the works and things are much simpler,
    fontwise, without it. Dealing with Classic is one area where a third-party font
    organizer can be a big help. <BR> <BR>One other tip: I have my font collection
    pretty well organized &#40;in a completely separate directory&#41; and I like
    to keep it that way, so I set FontBook&#39;s preferences to <b>copy</b> fonts
    rather than <b>move</b> them when installing them. That way, my originals stay
    nicely organized. When I uninstall them from FontBook, it just moves the copy
    to the Trash, again leaving my original safely organized. This does use up disk
    space with duplicate copies of fonts, but font files are so tiny compared to today&#39;s
    hard drives, it&#39;s a very small price to pay for convenience.'

  body: Ditto on Mark&#39;s move vs. copy experience, but I do it with <a href="http://www.insidersoftware.com/FA_pro_osx.php"
    target="_blank">FontAgent Pro</a> which I&#39;ve used for 2 years and found far
    more solid than FontBook, Font Reserve, or Suitcase.

  body: I understand that I am probably the only person on the planet who uses MasterJuggler,
    but I find it the best thing to use if you are developing fonts and have multiple
    versions of a developing design. Since all MJ does is turn the font on or off
    &#40;no moving/copying/creating databases&#41; it is a very simple and elegant
    solution. That and it allows you to peruse various unicode codepages within the
    fonts. To me it is the most ATM DeLuxe-like of them all. And I have tried them
    all.
