body: "Hey all, \r\n\r\nI need some typeface suggestions. Basically, I am creating
  a poster based on a movie quote, more specifically the chant about \"my rifle\"
  from Full Metal Jacket. I am at the moment very influenced by Alan Kitching, and
  my plan is to do the layout so that the type creates the shape of an american M16
  assaut rifle. I am not letterpressing it however, at least not yet. Now, I am looking
  for a heavy sans serif typeface, along the lines of Univers Extra Bold, but it need
  to have a bit more \"industrialized\" look, if that makes sense. A little more geometric.
  I have found one - Q Type Condensed Bold, but I\xB4m not 100% sure about this one
  either, and I want a few more alternatives. Any suggestions? Ideally something from
  the Vietnam War era (1955-1970). Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n//Anders"

  body: "Cheers guys, really appreciate it! I actually ended up using QType - after
    trying more \"decirative\" typefaces, this one looked best due to the amount of
    text and the different sizes. Heres a quick screenie (the printed format will
    be A1):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/rifle_finalized_6025.jpg]"

  body: Ideally, everything should be made out of type, but that seemed impossible
    with some of the parts, such as as the handle(?) and the rail.
