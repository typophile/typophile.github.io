  about it is this (from Luc Devroye!s website):\r\nApostrophe wrote this about Abrams
  Caslon:\"This was actually reviewed by Caflish and, if I remember correctly, Mark
  vonBronkhorst, so there are at least 3 or 4 copies of it out there, other than the
  Abrams' estate original data. Sumner Stone once said that this is the best Caslon
  he has ever seen. At least he has seen it; I haven't.\"\r\n\r\nThanks. I don't want
  to die without seeing it."

    English skills aren\u2019t that sophisticated) will ask politely - will provide
    detailed information and perhaps even a sample image of Abrams Caslon. (George

  body: "\"...residing on a single machine in Denmark...\" Yes, that was Abrams Venetian.\r\n\r\nQuoting
    again:\r\n\"Would like to thank Poul Steen Larsen for clarifying the history of
    Abrams' Venetian: \"The Abrams Venetian was donated to Mr. Poul Kristensen of
    Herning (in Jutland), then Printer to the Royal Court (which he has ceased to
    be in 1995). You are right about the font being today locked to Poul Kristensen'
    old Linotron, from which not even Linotype experts brought in to unlock it, could
    get it out for conversion into an up-to-date digital font. So the font will disappear
    from the type arena when Kristensens Linotron one day breaks down. You can trust
    me, for I was the one who established the contact between George and Mr. Kristensen
    back in 1986. The font was first used in 1989 in a book by Martin Lowry, British
    renaissance historian, with the title Venetian Printing. George Abrams' chalk
    drawings of the entire alphabet in regular and italic were scanned, more precisely
    vectorised on-screen and downloaded in Denmark by the Kristensens and therefore,
    in one sense, could be called the first Danish complete font.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    it is now digitized and did not \"disappear from the type arena\". So Caslon is
    the only one from the Abrams trilogy, that is not digitized yet (or at least not
    in the market)."

    (following the hype about the typeface) but the roman style is truly magnificent.
    That alone makes me wondering what the Caslon looks like.
