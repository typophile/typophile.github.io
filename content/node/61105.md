  body: "I like the drawn line concept and the armin hofmann reference in the pencil
    tip form but is the refection necessary?\r\nTo my mind it makes it more 'design
    and photoshop effects strike back'.\r\n\r\nIf you are really attached to the reflection
    the mirror image of the a/pencil doesn't seem quite right with the central bar.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: That's pretty smart looking - for some reason it reminds me of the titles
    to Kuberick's "Dr. Strangeglove". I don't know how well this will work at smaller
    sizes though.

    pencil tip...which looks great by the way. \r\n\r\nBring back the arches on the
    bottom of the pencil though I say."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pencil_4694.jpg]\r\nMike, here's why
    I think you saw a broom or a flipper. The image on the left scans as \"pencil\"
    because the lead is black. When it's reversed, that visual cue disappears."

  body: Exactly. And if the pencil was showing more the metaphor would be more readily
    apparent.

    Victor, i see your point about loosing the visual cue, but right now i have no
    clue how to correct that since i have to use white."

  body: "The visual cue is the continuous extending line (also rounding the white
    triangle helps).\r\nYou don\u2019t \u201Cneed\u201D to see the pencil (just like
    you don\u2019t need to see the arrow in the FedEx logo) and certainly you don\u2019t
    want to see a broom.\r\nKeep it simple and subtle.\r\nIf someone don\u2019t see
    the pencil at first, they will feel a sense of discovery when they did."

  body: Hello Thierry, personally I prefer the left-most version, using your previous
    tall "I". But for the letter "A", I prefer the right-most version, which still
    resemble an alphabet.

    and more - how to say - playfull, fun, puzzling - or a word like that\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/designstrike09_3416.jpg]"
