  body: This is similar to <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/Alphabets/Parisine.asp"
    target="_blank"> Parisine</a> by JFPorchez, but the &#39;e&#39; is wrong. It looks
    extended as well. Close to Agenda &#40;FB&#41; too, but more similar to JFPorchez.

  body: I can see that too. The myriad I mean. It was the &#39;l&#39; with the flick
    that made me think of Parisine Plus. Myriad&#39;s &#39;e&#39; is curved as well,
    however. Hmm.

  body: Yeah, the flick on the lc &#39;l&#39; and the straight lc &#39;e&#39; cross
    bar put me off the Myriad option too. No positive ID yet, methinks.
