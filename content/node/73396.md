  a CS suite or maybe something else from the distant past. I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nEither
  way, I was exporting a document from InDesign CS5 to PDF. As it compiled the pages,
  it gave me an error saying that due to licensing restriction, Bembo could not be
  embedded in the document. I have never seen this error before.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know how to handle this? Do I need to buy Bembo again? How do I know, if I buy it,
  the same thing won't happen again? Is this an InDesign export to PDF error?\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any insight, please let me know. I could resort to Fontforge which I
  know precious little about (I got it installed but that's it) and see if I could
  save as a TTF (the fonts in question are OTF) but that sounds hoaky and I don't
  know if that would work or do anything at all."

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nFirst of all, I assume your InDesign can do a PDF with any other
    font, so you can discard an InDesign failure.\r\n\r\nThe error you are reporting
    is very probably happening because the designer (or the company or someone else)
    decided to put this restriction into the font (in Fontlab, this option is called
    \u201Cembedding of this font is not allowed\u201D). I think the main reason to
    do so is to enforce to every user to buy a license (in this case, the people who
    will watch or work with the PDF).\r\n\r\nTwo things:\r\n\r\n\u2014You would need
    to check the End User License Agreement (EULA) of this particular font, but I
    am pretty sure that if they put this restriction, they won\u2019t let you to upgrade
    the permissions level. If this is the case, you may need to license a Bembo that
    doesn\u2019t have such restrictions.\r\n\u2014But I\u2019d try to know who designed/distributed
    this font in the first place. If you are on a Mac, you could check it out by opening
    the font with FontBook > Preview > Show Font Info. On a PC, I guess the foundry
    is shown if you double click it. I tell you this because 1), if you are going
    to buy a new license, you probably need to be sure that you are getting the exact
    same version so you can avoid text reflow; and 2), there are more than one [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/bembo/fonts/|Bembo]]:
    myfonts.com shows three typefaces with the same name, but I am almost certain
    that the three companies allow embedding on their fonts \u2013 they are Adobe,
    Monotype and Linotype. So probably your Bembo is a not very common version (or
    a version that someone else modified).\r\n\r\nIf you finally decide to buy a new
    license, you may want to contact the foundry to ask them if the chosen fonts have
    restrictions or, if they have, if by any chance you can change them.\r\n\r\nAnd
    maybe someone on this forum can tell you if the Bembo he/she owns can be embedded.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: if you are on a PC download Font properties extension at [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/truetypeproperty21.mspx]]
    Gives loads of info and also displays license info. If it's not in that font(file)
    it might be an old font.

    that embedded non-embeddable fonts.\r\n\r\nYour Bembo definitely did *not* come
    with one of the CS suites, because (a) it never came with this font, and even
    more so (b) all fonts that come with the CS suites are embeddable, no restrictions
    at all (which is, actually, very generous of Adobe)."

  body: "<cite>which is, actually, very generous of Adobe<cite>\r\n\r\nIndeed, since
    we all know that Adobe is giving its CS suits for free, with free upgrades too.
    No foundry should have been allowed to sell non-embeddable fonts to begin with,
    it is just ridicules and draconian."

    The TT was turned on for this job when I turned on the first Bembo I came across."

  body: "This probably happened because the ttf font you were using was made without
    any embedding information at all. When the Adobe programs meet a TrueType or OpenType
    font without the embedding bit set it treats it as if it has the strictest embedding
    = not embeddable. This is a choice Adobe was asked to make to accommodate all
    those fonts already on the marked when the embedding bit was introduced (after
    the uproar that happened when they initially started with allowing embedding of
    such fonts as default ;)\r\n\r\nSo the ttf you had was either very old or made
    by an old conversion program. Probably not an \"official\" font file. No such
    problems with updated TrueType or OpenType fonts \u2013 most professional fonts
    are made as at least allowing print & preview embedding."

  body: "Very interesting. I don't know when copyright notices are updated in fonts,
    but I did start on PageMaker 4 on PC back in 92 or so, and this particular font
    says (c) 1990 as noted above. My sneaking suspicion is that I've had this font
    since the early days, and in copying a project from PC to Mac when I made the
    leap in 98 or so to my first iMac, the font made it over. \r\n\r\nBack in the
    early days of TTF, there wasn't even a format of file to embed a font in, correct?
    PDFs weren't invented until 93 or so, and didn't catch on in prepress for many
    years after that.\r\n\r\nI'm completing a book on font combination samples, and
    of the 200 or so fonts used, this was the only one to give an issue when exporting
    the book to PDF, and I had never seen that issue before.\r\n\r\nIt's strange to
    think of a digital file being \"old\", but I guess some of us actually have fonts
    that could theoretically 20 years old or more, as they move from upgraded computer
    to upgraded computer over time."

  body: If the file is that old, it was probably originally a Type 1 that was converted
    to TTF to be usable under Windows ... Pre-Adobe Type Manager, perhaps, or to avoid
    having to use it.
