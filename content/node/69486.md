  body: This album came out in 1980. I don't think it was a Neville Brody design but
    I think it is geometric hand-lettering similar to record covers he was doing then.
    There's a lot of free techno fonts similar to most of it, but they will not have
    that awkward-looking A, unless someone has actually done a tribute font.
