body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been doing some experiments with the Blend Fonts command
  to produce interpolated weights. \r\n\r\nMy question concerns the interpolation
  of the kerning values. The interpolated weights produced from the master blended
  font contains some of the kerning pairs that are present in the orginal fonts but
  not all of them.\r\n\r\nI made sure that the orginal light and bold weights had
  the same kerning pairs but with different values.\r\n\r\nShould the kerning be interpolated
  ? \r\n\r\nIs there a better way of doing this ?\r\n\r\nIs there a reason way some
  kerning pairs are present and not others ?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    interpolated instance?\r\n\r\nI work with MM fonts all the time containing thousands
    of pairs and I never had a problem. If there's a problem it might be in the Blend
    Fonts function. I recall it being quite buggy in regards of handling kerning."

  body: "I agree to terminaldesign, forget the blend feature and use Mask to Master.
    However, Mask to Master does not merge the kerning.\r\n\r\nIf you need to transfer
    the kerning between masters or fonts you can use afm files. The metrics window
    allows you to export and import them. When you import an afm into an MM font,
    only the currently active master will be affected. Same for export. This works
    really reliably and has helped me repair MM fonts quite a few times already."

    (I was always concerned that making an MM font would be complicated).\r\n\r\nAll
    the glyphs are coloured green, (which means there are no problems right). The
    spacing and kerning all seems to be interpolating correctly with the same number
    of pairs in all generated instances. Before I get too excited is there anything
    else I should be looking for. I did spend a long time preping the light and bold
    weights, but my experience of developing fonts has always been two steps forward
    and one step back. This seems like two steps forward and I'm worried I'm missing
