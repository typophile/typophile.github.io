    sure. But coming from a grizzled and dedicated veteran of the screen font craft,
    your comment is very welcome.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to say, the timing of Webtype's
    livelihood is entirely random and was neither rushed nor delayed for Typecon.
    We had no intention of providing even the tiniest distraction from this great
    event in L.A. and hope everyone gets more stimulation and joy from the live versions
    of each other, than anything else.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    :)\r\n\r\nThe Ascender team is especially proud to have helped with our part in
    hinting David's new Reading Edge fonts, and excited about all the wonderful things
    still in the works at Webtype.\r\n\r\nBill"
