body: "Hey everyone. Does anyone know the name? ESPN magazine's typeface, the one
  with the number 3 looking lower case \"e\". It's on the cover of ESPN magazine digital
  (www.espnmag.com).\r\n\r\nThe second one is the text face for DETAILS magazine.
  Also used all uppercase on the cover.\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.
  Thanks!"
