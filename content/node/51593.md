    this seems to be the first occasion that you apparently linked to a pirated font
    on Typophile*. I truly appreciate that you seem to no longer do that, but I'm
    curious: why and when did you stop? You don't have to reply - I know it was a

    Moderator: You have to admit, Hrant's continuing actions are extreme harassment
    and should be cause for disbarment! \r\n\r\nDo we need any more proof that he
    is acting as an internet troll.  [[http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/weirdwebculture/f/what-is-an-internet-troll.htm]]\r\n\r\n\"The
    Sad Truths of Internet Trolls:\r\n1.\tTrolls enjoy using shock-value statements
    to get angry responses from others.\r\n2.\tTrolls gain energy by you insulting
    them.\r\n3.\tTrolls gain energy when you get angry.\r\n4.\tTrolls are immune to
    criticism and logical arguments. True trolls cannot be reasoned with, regardless
    of how sound your logical argument is.\r\n5.\tTrolls do not feel remorse like
    you and me. They have sociopathic tendencies, and accordingly, they delight in
    other people having hurt feelings.\r\n6.\tTrolls consider themselves separate
    from the social order. \r\n7.\tTrolls do not abide by etiquette or the rules of
    common courtesy.\r\n8.\tTrolls consider themselves above social responsibility.\r\n9.\tThe
    only way to deal with a troll is to ignore him, or take away his ability to post
    online.\"\r\n\r\nAND:\r\n\r\n\"How Exactly Do Internet Trolls Abuse Others?\r\n\r\nAns:
    Internet trolls seek to be disruptive and hurtful by using any of the following
    techniques: \r\n1.\tTrolls will post abusive and hurtful comments directed at
    a specific person (aka \"flaming\" another person)\r\n2.\tTrolls will incite broad
    arguments and provoke angry responses by making controversial statements. (e.g.
    racism, religious intolerance, bigoted or elitist views, mysogyny, extreme political
    views)\r\n3.\tTrolls will narcissistically dominate conversations, trying to make
    themselves the center of attention. (e.g. nonstop comments about themselves and
    their accomplishments; repeated self-centered statements and bragging)\r\n4.\tTrolls
    will start many off-topic threads, seeking to derail users from the focus of an
    online community.\"\r\n\r\nFINALLY:\r\n\r\n\"Why Do People Enjoy Being Internet
    Trolls?\r\n\r\nAns: it is a kind of power rush or ego trip to be a troll. Being
    online is a place that is largely free of perceived consequences... an insecure
    person can get a sense of power online, without ever having to face someone directly.
    With the Internet being a world of imagination and fantasy for some, cowardly
    users can forge an alter ego for themselves, and act out their feelings of anger
    and inadequacy. It's sad and unfortunate that our advanced communications also
    brings out the darker side of many people.\"\r\n\r\nQuod erat demonstratum.\r\n\r\nDick
    Pape\r\n"

    I can better understand how moderators decide to censor posts, I even say feel
    free to ignore me, and you react by flinging vicious insults. I feel you're the
    one who needs to be disciplined for these personal attacks, your previous promotion
    of pirated fonts (unless you apologized and I missed it - it's never too late,
    and to me it's entirely forgivable) as well as your provocative anti\u2013type-designer
    statements here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/5390#comment-38820\r\n\r\nThat said,

  body: "Dick, how is it an attack to mention something <em>public</em> that <em>you</em>
    did -furthermore kindly thanking you for no longer doing it- in order to get a
    better grasp of how Typophile handles such cases? Because I've never been in such
    a situation myself, so I lack the experience. Do you perhaps feel attacked because
    you're embarrassed of it yourself? Note that I made no such value judgment myself.
    And FWIW, I believe everybody makes mistakes, and if they express remorse they
    should be forgiven. But that's just me - nobody has to follow suit.\r\n\r\nIn
    contrast, you called me a sociopath, insecure and a coward.\r\n\r\nAnd in that
    other thread I referenced, you basically stated that anybody making money from
    fonts is a plagiarist. You further imply that nobody should pay for fonts. To
    me that all constitutes a \"massively parallel\" personal attack against hundreds
    of people who are Typophile's raison d'\xEAtre.\r\n\r\nBut I personally don't
    hold grudges, and remain open to any corrective efforts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
