  body: "My feeling is that this is an amputated Bodoni, customized by removing many
    of the serifs. Someone may have made a font like this, but it could just as easily
    have been done for each logo as custom modifications.\r\n\r\nHave you seem other
    words using these letters, or just the logos?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
