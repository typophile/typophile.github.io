body: I have a pretty lame request. <BR>The other day I noticed a review by Steven
  Heller of a book called &#34;Beirut&#39;s Memory&#34;, and I think it was in a major
  design magazine, but I went back to look for it, and I went crazy searching, but
  couldn&#39;t find it! Help? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
