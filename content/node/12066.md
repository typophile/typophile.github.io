body: "<strong>[[TypoWiki]] : Font Retailers</strong>\r\n\r\nFont Retailers sell fonts
  from several, and in some cases, many different [[foundries]]. Many foundries also
  sell their own fonts directly and sometimes in addition to selling through a retailer.\r\n\r\nMany
  of today's font retailers also carry their own font collection, such as [[Veer|Veer's]]
  Umbrella Collection, FontShop's [[FontFont]] foundry and Phil's Fonts with [[Garage
  Fonts]]. In other scenarios there are large foundries that have spun off a retail
  arm, such as [[Bitstream|Bitstream's]] [[MyFonts]] and [[Monotype|Monotype's]] [[Fonts.com]].

  Fonts|Phil's Fonts]]\r\n[[T-26]]\r\n[[Veer]]\r\n[[Village]]\r\n\r\nBefore adding
  retailers to this list, please consider whether the entry you're adding is better
  listed under [[Foundries]]."
