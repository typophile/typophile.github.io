  Text Editor]] is apparently a well-established and long-maintained Windows program
  that recently added OpenType support, despite the fact that it's written in... Delphi?!?!!
  I'm impressed!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oeaw.ac.at/kvk/cte/\r\n\r\nI am trying it now and
  having trouble getting the OpenType features to work, but I'm also using the Windows
  7 beta. Let me know if you can control the features. To switch the rendering engine
  to OpenType, go to Format menu -> Document item -> Font tab, and switch the engine
  to OpenType. Then you will see OpenType feature checkboxes in the Format -> Font
  dialog.\r\n\r\nI recommend Vista for this. You can supposedly get to it in XP if
  you transplant the Vista version of Uniscribe, which is tedious yet possible."
