  body: I like it. It gives a really nice quirky feeling. However, I think that some
    of the thins are too thin. The ff and tt ligatures don't work for me. Keep going!

  body: "Yes, I'm not sure about those thin serify bits. Maybe they need to be removed,
    or alternatively used more widely among the letters.\r\n/H/ may easily be misread
    as an /N/.\r\nI think the figures are the best part of what you have."

  body: "@Eliason: Good call on the /H/; I hadn't thought of that. The serify bits\u2014lets
    call them 'stumps'\u2014are to me an integral part of the character of the face.
    They're used on 14-16 glyphs (depending on if you use the alt E and F) and there
    are fatter stumps on 8-12 or so more (depending how broadly you define 'stump').
    So I thought it was pretty thoroughly established... Hmm... Is it just that the
    contrast is too much, as 1996type suggests?\r\n\r\nI definitely agree that the
    numerals are the best part, which is funny since I whipped them up in about 30min
    from sketches through vectors.\r\n\r\n@1996type: What is it about the ligatures
    you don't like?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn general, I need to do some x-height equalizing
    and such.\r\n\r\nHere's a catalog cover (rough draft) I designed using Laffy Fatty:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AIA-Covers_take2_4213.jpg]"

  body: "I decreased overshoot overall and evened out the x-height. New version is
    in the files at the top. Posters are also revised somewhat, but they don't use
    this latest version of the face.\r\n\r\n/G/ is the only significantly changed
    glyph, to which I added a spur that makes it much easier to read. Oh, and I added
    an ampersand."

    of them.

    good sportsmanship more than anything else. If you're going to solicit design
    feedback in a forum populated by professional typographers, some basic due diligence
    is in order. \r\n\r\nA Google search for [[http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=fatty+font&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8]|\"fatty
    font\"]] would've brought up Dilworth's font as one of the top results. A search
    on FontShop for \"fatty\" would've shown it as [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=fatty|the
    top result]]. [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/fatty/fonts/|Same with MyFonts]].
    \r\n\r\n\"But \u2026 but \u2026\" But what? The only possible counterarguments
    to this principle are \"I didn't know that Google, FontShop, or MyFonts existed\"
    or \"I didn't have the 10 seconds it would've taken to do those searches.\""
