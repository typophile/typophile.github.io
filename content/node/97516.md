body: "Well, after more than a year of casual coding, I've released Glyphr Studio
  Beta 2 out into the wild!\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIt's incredibly young and crude, but
  I think the idea of an HTML5-based font design tool is very exciting.  I encourage
  you to take a look at it over at <a href=\"http://www.glyphrstudio.com\">glyphrstudio.com</a>,
  I'm trying to get the word out because i'd love real font designers to try it out,
  and give me feedback.  Pretty soon i'll start working on Beta 3, and your feedback
  could guide what I do next!\r\n\r\nAnd a big thank you to everyone who has already
  looked through it and given me feedback!\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more info.\r\n\r\n::Matt"
