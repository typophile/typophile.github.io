body: '{Pardon Cross-Post} <BR> <BR>Recently I had the pleasure of perusing the first
  three <BR>issues of TYPO magazine, a new Czech publication, <BR>and I wanted to
  present a quick review of it. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.magtypo.cz/" target="_blank">http://www.magtypo.cz/</a>
  <BR> <BR>Overall it looks like the polished work one would expect from <BR>a sophisticated
  European source. It does feel a little thin in <BR>terms of page count with respect
  to its other attributes which <BR>are more generous &#40;like spread size, production
  quality, etc&#41;, <BR>but the information is concentrated, without however feeling
  <BR>crowded. And this thin-ness leaves tantalizing room for easily <BR>scaling up
  the content. My only typographic complaint is that <BR>the English text seems too
  recessed: both smaller and grayer, <BR>somewhat hard to read. <BR> <BR>On the other
  hand, it&#39;s great to have the text in both Czech <BR>and English because the
  content of TYPO is certainly relevant <BR>to much more than just Czech designers:
  many of the articles <BR>are some of the best treatments of the given topic I&#39;ve
  seen, <BR>like the series on bitmap fonts in issue #3. Frankly, if you have <BR>no
  interest in Eastern European type whatsoever even the <BR>modest subscription price
  &#40;6 Euro per issue&#41; wouldn&#39;t actually <BR>be worth it - but there&#39;s
  so much to learn form that part of the <BR>world, it would be a shame to have such
  an isolationist stance. <BR>The few articles not provided with English translations
  tend to <BR>be technical discussions &#40;like Mac OSX font managers&#41; which
  <BR>are easy to find in English elsewhere anyway. <BR> <BR>Besides the bitmap fonts
  articles the two others that stood <BR>out for me were an interesting -and in fact
  unorthodox- bit <BR>of coverage about newspaper fonts &#40;in issue #1&#41;, and
  a very  <BR>insightful article about the development of the Prague graphic <BR>identity
  &#40;in #2&#41;. In this article were presented viewpoints <BR>and analysis from
  all the possible angles, making for a very <BR>objective treatment, totally unlike
  the insincere whitewash <BR>we&#39;ve become used to suffering in the large design
  magazines. <BR> <BR>TYPO also features some timely &#34;news&#34; items &#40;like
  the Frothy <BR>debacle, and that bancomicsans.com campaign&#41;, and last <BR>but
  not least, it features Frantisek Storm... if you thought <BR>his fonts were colorful,
  you should get a whif of his writing: <BR>&#34;Unlike the strictly rational Didot
  or elegant Bodoni, Walbaum <BR> does not, at first sight, have features that would
  give the <BR> fonts a brief adjective. However, it is definitely an outstanding
  <BR> achievement, without any shadow of Walbaum&#39;s candymaking. <BR>The expression
  is robust, as if seasoned with cow manure some- <BR>where near Weimar, where Walbaum&#39;s
  type foundry was situated <BR>in the years 1803-1839.&#34; <BR> <BR>So, as Filip
  Blazek &#40;the magazine&#39;s editor&#41; would say: Czech it out! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: "Jesse, 'TYPO' primarily IS a printed magazine, in Czech and English, and
    <em>( was )</em> additionally available as PDF version, later on. To quote the
    'About' page on www.magtypo.cz: '<em>..It contains 32-44 full color pages printed
    on high quality coated paper..</em>'\r\n\r\nSoo, The price you mention would /
    should be the one of a subscription to the printed mag + the shipping to your
    desired country. :)\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "aight i figured that was for shipping and handeling but i never saw a price
    for pdfs so i was confused. So its $84 for 24 issues. Seems pricy but i guess
    it isn't that much per issue and shipping isn't cheap. Does anyone subscribe?
    \r\n\r\nHow does it compare to Baseline Magazine?"

    As its published bimonthly / every two months. I think the problem really is the
    'International' shipping, as the mag itself would only be $ 30 USD. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "In fact TYPO is currently the only type magazine on the planet. Baseline
    (to which I subscribed for many years, paying a small fortune in the process,
    but actually recuperating it all thanks to an eBay sale of my back issues) has
    very little type design coverage these days, and it tends to be too arty. TYPO
    is a great mix of technique and art. There's also Eye (which I class above Baseline)
    but again its type design coverage is sparse compared to TYPO.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
