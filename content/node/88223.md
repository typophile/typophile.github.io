  body: Thanks, is there any kind of font that would just print the outline of the
    letters. It kinda looks like the letter are hollow in the middle and that the
    actual print is just an outline?

  body: The "outline" looks like an artifact of the engraving process, metal displaced
    to the edges of the letter strokes. This effect should be possible to simulate
    with Photoshop filters.

  body: Thank you for the tips!! So do you feel, by looking at the outlines, that
    the font used was an arial font?
