  body: "For a restuarant/bar. The owner already thinks he's a \"designer\" so he
    wants to use something similar to Rosewood Fill. Basically, we need a set of lowercase
    characters so for some miscellaneous interior signage, and I'm not too keen on
    this font anyway. My plan is to entice him away with another Slab serif font that
    isn't being so overused at the moment.\r\n\r\n"

  body: How about Red Rooster's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/consort-rr/|Consort]]?
    Basically a condensed Clarendon. It looks sturdier than Rosewood Fill.
