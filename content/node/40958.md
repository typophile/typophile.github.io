  body: "Any background on the client? Is this an actual restaurant? If so what kind
    of food? Is it upscale, homey, hip?\r\n\r\nHard to judge without knowing a bit
    about the intended audience."

  body: 'I know it''s a little trend at the moment, but personally I would avoid the
    brackets. They may be a nice decoration, but they are also unnecessary punctuation. '

  body: This is just for a school project. The cafe is more upscale and hip. The cafe
    will be like Starbucks but they will have more selection of gourmet food from
    sandwiches, soups, snacks, and baked goods. Very similar to Eat. http://www.eat.co.uk/

  body: I see where Don is coming from. Jumping on a trend bandwagon isn't the best
    way to an original logo that will stand the test of time (see Xerox), but I think
    the simplicity of these sans brackets is clean and unique enough.

  body: "I like where 01 is going. If this is to be a caf\xE9 in London, I'd think
    a slab serif would make it stand out more from all the other sans serif shops
    and such. I would change the spacing though. \"Caf\xE9\" should be the same distance
    from \"Seventy\" as the space in between the baseline of \"Seventy\" and the x-height
    of \"Nine\"."

  body: just looking at 01. I find the rectangle created by the "af" very distracting.

  body: I noticed the rectangle thing too. I like 02, but I don't know if it's because
    I've seen something like it recently. Good work though! Very clean stuff.

    in 4 were thinner, I think it would read better. Right now, its almost \"Seventy
    Cafe Nine\" \r\n\r\nGood luck! "

  body: I would try to keep a visual relation between the letterforms and other graphic
    elements. For example, your bars and lines should have either the same or a proportional
    stroke weight to the strokes on letterforms.

  body: "I think I'm pulling for 5, 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nFor #5: I love the screened back
    79 and the variation in weight. I would maybe try the same treatment in small
    caps with a different font. Maybe Gotham HTF or something of that nature and Kern
    it out a bit. But it's a nice design.\r\n\r\nFor #7: This is my favorite. It's
    very clean and modern with the brackets containing things nicely and giving a
    slightly organic elegance to the whole composition. Maybe also try this treatment
    with a box around it instead of the brackets just to see how it works. Well done
    here.\r\n\r\nFor #8: I again love the variations in weight and the small caps
    of the Caf\xE9 on top. Nicely treated with it bumping up to the 't'. And you did
    a nice job maintaining a good evenness of the air around caf\xE9 on the bottom
    and right. Maybe try one with seventy in the same font as nine but in a heavier
    weight.\r\n\r\nBeautiful treatments all around. I think that's DIN in #2, is it
    not? One of my favorite fonts, but a bit too rigid and technical for a caf\xE9.\r\n\r\nI
    think you've done splendidly with #7. My favorite hands down.\r\n\r\nMind if I
    ask what font that is?"
