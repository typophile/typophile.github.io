  body: Funny, the Microsoft monopoly rears its ugly head yet again. Fine, the type
    is good looking, but many of the people that care and would use it do not use
    PCs. I&#39;m not going out and buying a PC for six typefaces. Sorry, MS.  <BR>
    <BR>I think this will prove to be impetus for more energy in the open source community
    to develope better and more universal techniques for using any typeface a website
    owns through the back end. It&#39;s been coming along any way, now linux and mac
    users will be forced to find a better way. This way, if you have a screen face,
    or a pixel font, or any typeface you want for headlines, you could use it and
    maintain your visual system, rather than defaulting to whatever MS mandates.  <BR>
    <BR>I think it&#39;s great that MS puts an emphasis on typeface design in instances
    like this, but it&#39;s clearly meant to exclude non-windows users. It&#39;s fine,
    they put the time and money into it, I&#39;m not saying these faces should be
    free. I just think we&#39;re gonna see a gear shift, that&#39;s all.

    x-heights for the optional sans or serif faces. Or maybe a wider body option.
    <BR> <BR>Every type designer, I would imagine, given the opportunity to create
    for such a universal user group, wants to design the ideal face and heads for
    the average proportions, so as a whole the variety suffers. <BR> <BR>Also, where
    is the light weight sans serif that typographers really need to add some contrast

    95% of users - sure they do it to gain more customers, but you can&#39;t blame
    one company for the flawed system that is Capitalism. I don&#39;t think much of
    megacorporations in general, but compared to Apple &#40;icky full-fuzz rendering&#41;
    I think the MS type boys are a godsend. And if this motivates the competitors
    of MS to make better stuff themselves, that&#39;s even better! <BR> <BR>Again,

  body: I&#39;m sure these will be very useful typefaces, I was just pointing out
    there isn&#39;t much range here for art directors. For instance, all the &#34;o&#34;s
    are semi-condensed. Is this because the 5 fonts are supposed to harmonize, or
    is it some principle of legibility? Or maybe just the shape du jour? Surely more
    contrast between letter shapes would be better for reading-- seems like the theorists
    are scared the letters will get too close together.  <BR> <BR>&#62;WRBWWRM <BR>
    <BR>That&#39;s not actually my philosophy.  I&#39;ve argued against some of your
    bouma-izing in the past, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m from the &#34;opposite&#34;
    camp; I think reading is very complex &#40;yes, I&#39;m Hudsonian&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW,

    In fact in the past year or two it has moved closer to Kevin and away from Peter

  body: <i>Every type designer, I would imagine, given the opportunity to create for

    average proportions, so as a whole the variety suffers.</i> <BR> <BR>There was
    a conscious decision by the project planners that four of the six faces would
    have the same x-height so that they could be used together in the same line of
    text with ease. My Constantia type has a smaller x-height and longer extenders
    &#40;hence, more &#39;bookish&#39;&#41;, and Luc&#39;s Consolas monospaced font
    has a larger x-height; the others are all the same. Remember that the huge majority
    of people using these fonts will not be typographers, but MS Word users. So we
    can&#39;t expect them to be sophisticated enough to figure out how to visually
    harmonise different typefaces through relative scaling, so the goal was to simplify
    this for them by making fonts that are at least reasonably harmonised. For the
    same reason, the fonts have coordinated vertical metrics, so that the linespacing
    remains constant whichever of the fonts you employ. Yes, this is at the expense
    of variety, but variety was not the goal.

    marketing plan behind that, or if it was just how he felt that afternoon. I wasn&#39;t
    invited to that meeting. <BR> <BR>Constantia went through several different name
    options, each of which failed the extensive international trademark search at
    some point. You wouldn&#39;t believe how expensive international trademark searches
    are. When I found out, I told MS to &#39;call my font Cxghjrnsjl and let me have
    the money you save on the trademark search&#39;. They could have afforded to commission
    another new type family for the amount of money they spent on trademark searches
    for these ones. Just when you think type designers are getting decent pay for

    say this, but I think the text looks great in 10.3 &#40;Panther&#41;. Maybe it
    depends on the monitor. I&#39;m using Apple flat panels and I&#39;ve set the antialiasing
    preference to &#34;best for flat panel&#34; which does sub-pixel smoothing. It
    seems very comfortable to read to me, and I&#39;ve been using computers for over
    twenty years. I do sit with my eyes about two feet from the monitor &#40;I can
    no longer focus closer than about a foot without reading glasses&#41;, maybe that&#39;s
    a factor. I do agree that the earlier versions of the Quartz font smoothing were
    not as good, especially in the initial release of OS X. <BR> <BR>I also have a
    Windows box with a flat panel display, but it&#39;s using an analog VGA connection
    so it looks very smeary, even with ClearType enabled. No fault of the software--just
    a hardware deficiency. I&#39;m sure it would look better with a digital video
    adapter, although I&#39;m not sure if the monitor supports it.

    not borne out by the facts. Apple only ships 100dpi displays across its product
    line, while I&#39;m typing this on a three and a half year old IBM laptop with
    133 dpi resolution. Similarly, while Apple&#39;s displays are 250-270 cd/sq m,
    you can buy a Sony at 400. Apple has had for many years a strange tendency to
    <a href="http://advogato.org/person/raph/diary.html?start=111">advertise</a> the
    relative technical weakness of their displays as a strength. <BR> <BR>There are
    three factors that go into overall type rendering quality: the software algorithms
    &#40;ClearType vs Apple&#39;s font smoothing vs whatever&#41;, the resolution
    of the display, and the other display quality characteristics &#40;brightness,
    contrast, viewing angle, color fidelity&#41;. Of these, resolution is the absolute
    most important. In my testing, the algorithm can make only about a 20% difference
    at most in the effective resolution of the screen: a 120 dpi screen with the most
    vanilla antialiased rendering will perform about the same as a 100 dpi screen
    with the most finely crafted font rendering imaginable. Makes you wonder why I&#39;m
    spending valuable research time on font rendering quality, doesn&#39;t it? <BR>
    <BR>Right <i>now</i>, resolution seems to be stuck, but I consider it inevitable
    that faster CPU&#39;s and advances in display tech will bring 200dpi displays

    <BR> <BR>In Greek the double-consonant mu-pi stands for both the &#34;b&#34; sound
    and the &#34;mb&#34; sound. Correct pronunciation depends on two parameters: the
    word root/origin &#40;e.g. classical, Latin, Byzantine, Hebrew, Italian, Turkish,
    Slavic&#41; and where in the grammatical space from classical Demotic through
    Standard Modern Greek to more formal structures a speaker positions himself.  <BR>
    <BR>Two examples:   <BR> <BR>- the well known Greek dance \xAB\u03B6\u03B5\u03CA\u03BC\u03C0\u03AD\u03BA\u03B9\u03BA\u03BF\u03C2\xBB
    [zeib&#39;ekikos] has Asia Minor roots, and its name comes from the Turkish &#34;zeybek&#34;.
    This is always pronounced with a hard &#34;b&#34;  <BR> <BR>- the Greek word \xAB\u03BF\u03BC\u03C0\u03C1\u03AD\u03BB\u03B1\xBB
    [ombr&#39;ela] is derived from &#34;umbrella&#34; and pronounced with the mu voiced,
    followed by the &#34;b&#34; sound. <BR> <BR>Depending on the grammatical period,
    hyphenation may also change according to the above parameters. Speakers/Readers
    learn correct pronunciation in school, although recent language reforms have diluted
    the capacity of the written forms to indicate corrent pronunciation.  <BR> <BR>This
    summary excludes regional variations and a ton of stuff, but it should help give
    a basic idea of how things work.  <BR> <BR>With regard to the MS font names, sufficient
    care was taken to ensure they will be usable and unambiguous. All Greek readers
    will pronounce &#34;Cambria&#34; with a voiced mu preceding the &#34;b&#34; sound.
    &#34;Corbel&#34; will always be pronounced &#34;korb&#39;el&#34; because the mu
    in mu-pi is never voiced if preceded by another consonant.  <BR> <BR>Finally,
    it is a safe assumption that all Greek tycoons will be familiar with the Latin
    alphabet."

    rendering, which means that there are no x-direction deltas, and only very basic
    x-direction stem instructions &#40;primarily to cover the possibility of their
    use on 300 dpi printers; initially, the fonts were tested successfully under ClearType
    without any x-direction hinting at all&#41;. This could be changed, if there were
    a compelling need for the fonts to be used in non-ClearType environments, but
    they were designed specifically for use with ClearType &#40;more specifically,
    for the version of ClearType that will ship with Longhorn&#41;. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re
    welcome to your opinion, but I have to disagree with the characterisation of these
    designs as &#39;mediocre&#39;, and plenty of other people whose opinion I respect

    using them extensively for more than a year now. I use Constantia as my default
    broswer font, Candara for e-mail, amd Corbel as my system UI font. Consolas is
    the best monospaced font I have ever used &#40;an opinion shared by many of the
    programmers at MS who tested it during development&#41;. <BR> <BR>I look forward
    to the free software community&#39;s attempt to overtake Microsoft&#39;s position

    I&#39;m not aware of any change to that. The fonts were designed and built around
    a specific rendering engine, which is unique to Longhorn, so among other considerations
    there are quality control issues. If MS can&#39;t be guaranteed that the fonts
    will look as good elsewhere as in Longhorn, they will be concerned about degrading
    the reputation of the fonts by using them with other rendering engines. <BR> <BR>That
    said, according to the Poynter article, there seems to be some vague possibility
    that another company, e.g. Apple, might be able to license the new fonts. But
    these fonts are very unlikely to ever be freely licensed in the way Georgia and
    Verdana were. Georgia and Verdana were distributed in the way they were in order
    to ensure widespread availability for spec&#39;ing in websites. The new MS fonts
    are specifically value-added components of Longhorn, intended to improve the onscreen
    reading experience of Longhorn users.

    I didn&#39;t see all of the submissions until after the decision had been made.
    The final list of designs selected by MS was not, in fact, my preferred selection.
    Si Daniels was part of the selection committee at MS; most of the other people

    worth a try. <BR> <BR>&#62;However, if everyone who buys a computer had to buy
    the typefaces they use on it, rather than having them bundled free, <BR> <BR>or
    using shareware. Shareware fonts are extremely popular among the masses who make
    up the bulk of computer users. At least among the ones who take any interest in
    fonts. <BR> <BR>&#62; the type market as a whole would be a lot more diverse,
    and a lot more lucrative for a lot more type designers. With the big money in
    retail, not just commissions. <BR> <BR>Yes, in any market if you can magically
    &#40;or by means of new laws&#41; eliminate the least expensive sources of goods,
    the demand for what remains generally increases, and the profits go up. Price-fixing
    and cartels are also effective &#40;and usually illegal&#41; ways to do this.
    All generally good for manufacturers and bad for consumers, say economists. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; MyFonts, one of the largest font retailers, has just announced that
    they&#39;ve sold 40,000 fonts &#40;in 5 years&#41;. Compare with the millions
    of Longhorn font bundles that will be going out.  <BR> <BR>Besides the fact that
    your numbers are wrong, even with the right numbers, what do they tell us? Do
    you really think that the average Windows user is a likely font customer? I suggest
    that even if Windows only bundled Times New Roman, Arial, Courier, Symbol and
    Wingdings, and additional language-specific fonts, a large majority of users would
    still never buy a single font. <BR> <BR>But nonetheless, there&#39;s no doubt
    in my mind that bundled OS/app fonts and shareware fonts have an impact on the
    retail font market. It&#39;s natural that companies will want to bunde fonts,
    and it&#39;s only because they think fonts are important in the first place that
    they invent the standards that the font foundries rely on. Not to mention licensing
    tools and even source code at no charge. It&#39;s a complicated ecosystem, but
    any portrayal of independent foundries as simply victimized by the big OS and
    app vendors is at least a gross oversimplification, and arguably just plain wrong.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Of note, script faces dominate the retail market, and they&#39;re
    diverse -- this is a category of type not bundled by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe.
    Coincidence ....? <BR> <BR>Hmmm. Lucida Calligraphy &#40;Microsoft&#41;, Apple
    Chancery &#40;Apple&#41; and Caflisch Script Pro &#40;Adobe&#41; all come to mind.
    So I think the second half of the premise is false. <BR> <BR>So, what&#39;s your
    &#34;solution,&#34; Nick? Make both bundled fonts and shareware fonts illegal?
    <BR> <BR>Making bundled fonts illegal would have interesting spin-off effects,
    too. Design templates for graphics and publishing applications would become impractical
    or have to use the most generic system fonts. Of course, your same arguments against
    bundled fonts could be applied to bundled templates, which surely take at least
    some business away from graphic designers. Should they be illegal, too? <BR> <BR>Or
    do you think that OS and app vendors, and shareware makers, should just voluntarily
    refrain from doing/commissioning fonts, because it would help certain other companies?

    for example. Not to mention that even Courier looks sensational in ClearType.

    it is so obviously the best candidate for a general purpose ClearType font? It

    as well! Let Microsoft give the &#39;Hudson Collection&#39; to Tiro Typeworks,
    for a peppercorn fee, and let Tiro try to sell them retail!&#41;  <BR> <BR>&#62;Of
    note, script faces dominate the retail market, and they&#39;re diverse - <BR>
    <BR>But Nick, are you suggesting that the ClearType people should do script faces?
    To what end? ClearType isn&#39;t retail, and is meant to be read on screen. With
    all due respect, who would want to read with a script font? Even such a very nice
    script font as Fontesque for example? <BR> <BR>And on a serious note - what on
    earth are we going to do when designers of the calibre of Zapf, Frutiger, Carter
    and Stone are no longer with us? None of the younger generation comes close to
    their level of achievement; those who were young ten years ago and are now middle
    aged do not seem to have matured fruitfully. In a way, one can see that it&#39;s
    the one-man shop problem. There are a few great designers around who know everything
    about how to make a great typeface, but who can&#39;t actually design anything
    interesting. Then you havve a group of people who have interesting design ideas
    but who have no idea how to make a consistent and valuable font. Twenty or thirty
    years ago, the two different types would have been working for the same company
    and feeding off one another. Now, unfortunately, everybody is on his own. The
    only four designers I can think of who are capable of consistently and creatively
    producing excellent type over a period of many decades, more or less unaided,
    are the four I mentioned: Carter, Zapf, Frutiger, Stone. <BR> <BR>Why on earth
    isn&#39;t Microsoft commissioning them? They would all work for rather less than
    &#39;John Hudson&#39;, I happen to know. Oh! and Berlow! These days, you could

    why not spend it on the greats? Just look at the amateurism rampant here. For
    example, the italic and bold italic s in Constantia - the kind of error you&#39;d
    expect in someone drawing type for ten weeks. Let&#39;s take Calibri, of which
    Lucas, the one actual professional in this group, says &#39;Its proportions allow
    high impact in tightly set lines.&#39; Oh yes? Then what is that river of space
    doing around the u? Why is the right sidebearing about twice what it should be
    and the left sidebearing about a quarter? Why is the color of each weight, and
    each weight in relationship to the other, so completely off? Look at the word
    exclamations in bold in that font - the color is so badly judged that the exc
    looks like it was smudged by comparison to the rest of the word and the diagonals
    in the x look too heavy. And how do those clotted g forms aid readability? And
    why do the bolds and bold italics in nearly all the fonts look a point size too
    large? You know, sometimes, even a really good designer needs a good art director
    to tell him where he is going wrong, and there surely wasn&#39;t one here, if
    what I am seeing represents final versions. Look at the italic a in Candara. It&#39;s
    not just that it&#39;s too narrow &#40;where so many of the other fonts in this
    series have letters that are too wide&#41;; it just doesn&#39;t seem to have any
    relationship to the other letters in the words; it&#39;s like an ugly changeling.
    And that silly italic e, straight out of a Dwiggins nightmare, and again, problems
    with all of the s&#39;s. What is that silly filip on the stem of the p in Cambria
    that drags the whole letter out of true? But don&#39;t get me started. There isn&#39;t
    any end to the problems here. It&#39;s all amateursville, a type bakeoff. <BR>

    <BR>Were there critiques? Was there anyone of the calibre even of a Fred Brady,
    a Carol Twombley, a Robert Slimbach, to make suggestions?  <BR> <BR>Where is the
    expertise of a Zapf, a Frutiger, a Carter, a Stone, a Berlow? What about Dennis
    Pasternak, that wonderful designer who never pushes himself onto internet discussion
    boards and who really, really knows how to design type? What about some of the
    great eccentrics who we never hear from, such as that modest Canadian, Jim Rimmer,
    probably Canada&#39;s best designer, who might, with some guidance, have risen
    superbly to this kind of challenge? Or the wonderful fellow in Massachusetts -
    what is his name? - Dan Carr - who knows so much more about type and readability
    than some of the Coca-Cola belt hillbillies on display here?  <BR> <BR>Was there
    an art director? Someone of the calibre of a Roger Black, a Sumner Stone? For
    Heaven&#39;s sake, great type people are a dime a dozen, and _this_ is what you
    have to show for 25&#43;G a weight?'

    every word you say has served me well for several years, so I&#39;m going back
    to that policy.&#60; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s OK, &#39;John&#39; - I don&#39;t mind.
    But can I suggest you extend the policy a little bit? Nothing serious - just -
    to type?   <BR> <BR>&#62;But Happy Easter anyway. <BR> <BR>What is it with this
    fellow, pushing this obviously insincere Christian message, like an advert, nearly
    everytime you post? Are you trying to craft an image as the good ole family values
    fellow of type? Is there now an evangelical wing of the Type Party? Are you, perhaps,
    its Chief Ecclesiastic? Is there a business purpose behind it all? Do you really
    think you are spreading the gospel? At any rate, it mystifies everyone, it isn&#39;t
    in good taste, and it just does not seem to be consistent behaviour in one who
    might truly aspire to Christian beliefs - I mean this way you have of leaving
    your supposed Christianity out to hang on every Internet clothesline.'

  body: Oops, 40,000 fonts versus a million. &#40;Late night post, sorry&#41;. But
    whatever the exact numbers, it&#39;s pretty obvious that Calibri will be on tens
    of millions of hard drives via Microsoft, whereas Luc de Groot would be a multi-millionaire
    if 1% of them bought Taz. <BR> <BR>&#62;Price-fixing and cartels are also effective
    &#40;and usually illegal&#41; ways to do this. All generally good for manufacturers
    and bad for consumers, say economists. <BR> <BR>Government intervention is generally
    a good way to stop megacorp monopolists from giving people cheap crap, say citizen
    activists. <BR> <BR>&#62;So, what&#39;s your &#34;solution,&#34; Nick? Make both
    bundled fonts and shareware fonts illegal?  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have a &#34;solution&#34;,
    Thomas, certainly not anything as heavy handed as criminal legislation. But objecting
    to injustice is always a good place to start. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to see some
    solidarity amongst type designers. But as a professional group of any size, we&#39;re
    a relatively new phenomenon. It took a while for art directors and graphic designers
    to organize. There are type organizations, but they are industry-wide.  <BR> <BR>Pardon
    me for sticking up for the little guy, but some of us don&#39;t automatically
    assume that what&#39;s good for Microsoft/Adobe/Apple is good for the world, ennit?
    <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>Bill, thanks for the compliment, but I prefer not
    to think of Fontesque as a script! To my mind, it&#39;s only marginally less wonky
    than the metal Garamond boomers grew up reading in Dr Seuss &#40;North America&#41;
    and Noddy &#40;UK&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#62;Lucida Calligraphy
    &#40;Microsoft&#41;, Apple Chancery &#40;Apple&#41; and Caflisch Script Pro &#40;Adobe&#41;
    all come to mind. So I think the second half of the premise is false. <BR> <BR>Well,
    there are exceptions, but I&#39;m really talking about where the action is. There
    are some brilliant, technically  innovative scripts provided by the bundlers.
    But there are only a few, and they are all extremely formal &#40;even Comic Sans&#41;.
    There is just not the range that there is in bundled sans and serif fonts, and
    nothing in the hot genres of retro and vernacular.

    like John Hudson so criticizes new Microsoft screen fonts based on printed samples
    <BR> <BR>I wonder how people &#40;even objective people&#41; would have responded
    to Verdana or Georgia if they&#39;d seen samples in print &#40;or scans of print
    samples&#41; before seeing it on screen at small sizes?

  body: '&#62;But Nick, are you suggesting that the ClearType people should do script
    faces? To what end? ClearType isn&#39;t retail, and is meant to be read on screen.
    With all due respect, who would want to read with a script font? <BR> <BR>My point
    is that there is a lively market in script faces, partly because it&#39;s a genre
    that the bundlers haven&#39;t concentrated on saturating. Users&#39; wants and
    needs for script fonts are not being met by free bundled fonts, so they buy them.
    <BR> <BR>As for script fonts on screen, surely the success of that popular internet
    font Comic Sans indicates a demand?'
