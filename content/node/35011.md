  body: That s is more of a hand-drawn squiggle than a true s. This entire thing could
    be re-drawn quite easily. I do agree with Stephen's assessment btw.

  body: "The problem with Bauhaus is that the curves don't connect back to the stems
    on the p and g. The Bauhaus uppercase G is also not perfectly round like the sample.
    For Chalet, the t would need a new crossbar, the e would have to be horizontally
    scaled in (not recommended, clearly), and the s gets redrawn.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vestigeGroup_6146.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nHorton\r\nFounder,
