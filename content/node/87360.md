  do I go about propagating - meaning that the other glyphs change along with that
  lc 'a'? A script? A feature that I'm missing in FL?\r\n\r\nAny help, I'd appreciate.
  Thanks.\r\n\r\nrich"

    is a major headache in dealing with already-compiled fonts. For the kind of work
    you are doing, you should try to get FL source files when possible (in the hope
    that they have components already existing).\r\n\r\nAnother plus of components
    is that they can translate nicely to TT composites, making for smaller initial
    TTFs. (How much size reduction composites offer once you gzip the result is an
    interesting question I'd love to know the answer to....)\r\n"

    body: "Oh, and you shouldn't apologize. FontLab Studio has so many freakin' features,
      and they are often non-obvious.... Every now and then I am trying to do something
      I haven't done before, and find a new-to-me feature that helps, even though
      I have been using it since 1994.\r\n\r\nTrivia point: FontLab 2.5 had a different
      kind of subroutine feature that allowed you to do something like components,
      only it even worked with parts of paths! So you could for example have a serif
      shape as a subroutine that you could edit once and have take effect everywhere.
      I still miss this feature. Reportedly FontLab Studio 7 may have some serious
      moves in this direction again."

    way as yet. And I certainly know what you mean about non-obvious. Folks can bitch
    about FL all they want, but it IS deep, that it is.\r\n\r\nI'm on a public computer
    at the moment but will try Find/Replace Shapes at the earliest opportunity. Thanks
    to frankrolf\r\n\r\nA script sounds mighty good. I've got Python installed and
    it works.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a script for this? I'm certainly willing to
    purchase, if need be.\r\n\r\n(I'd love to tackle it myself, but the time factor....)\r\n\r\nrich\r\n\r\nThanks."

    sidebearings and positioning? Maybe I was being dense, but it didn't seem to have
    the needed \"intelligence\" for this kind of operation.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned
    it, but I had forgotten about it after one or two less-than-exciting experiments.
    But maybe I just haven't figured it out properly.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: FontForge calls it references, there is a "Replace with Reference" feature
    that takes the currently selected glyph(s) and replaces any occurrence of that
    glyph with a reference to it. Any changes any the referenced glyph will propagate
    to glyphs referencing it, there is also a "Use My Metrics" lock, so that the side
    bearings are kept in sync as well (I think the later is even a feature of TrueType
    fonts, not something FontForge specific). May be FontLab have similar features.

    shapes inside a segment. And only in case of an exact match.\r\nBeing pretty impressive
    from the outset, it has the potential of a killer-feature\_\u2013 but isn\u2019t.
    But it\u2019s neat in certain situations. (Also, Cmd-Shift-V is.)"

    be better solved by doing something different earlier in my usual workflow. But

  body: "At the suggestion of Sumner Stone, I tried using \"components\" as a way
    to design a typeface. I tried sticking with it and eventually completed the character
    set.  True, I was able to try numerous modifications and permutations and created
    dozens of alternates. Surprisingly, it seemed to take quite a bit longer than
    I expected for the options it allowed me.\r\n\r\nI am sure there are plenty of
    type designers who can work this way, but.  After the \"experiment\", I happily
    went back to my old way of working.  The component thing was just not a good fit
    for me.  It requires a sense of organization and labeling that just is not me.
    \ I am more suited to open-ended flurries of doing whatever seems right at the
    time.  I might call it my \"organic method\" of taking root in a form and then
    growing it as nature seems to provide.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that I condemn
    or even cast a glance of jaundice at the method.  It just means, if the suit fits
    comfortably, where it to work. If you are more comfortable in a T-shirt and jeans,
    it might not suit you to a T--(or any other glyph. ;-)"

    the target glyphs (assuming there''s nothing in it you care about), then swap
    the outline with the mask. Now when you paste the components, you will have the
    original outline in the mask layer as a reference to check that the position of
