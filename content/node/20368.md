  body: Probably hand drawn, but it's got that Ed Benguiat flavour. Did you try searching

  body: "There was a <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/4136\">previous thread</a>
    about this. You should try searching before posting, you'd be surprised. \r\n\r\nBTW,
    I find it better to use google to search Typophile than the inbuilt search, using
    the \"site:typophile.com\" thingy. :^)"

    restored. You'd expect the guys in charge to at least warn the moderators... :^/
