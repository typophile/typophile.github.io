  body: Nah, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=FF.2957.0.4&amp;attributes.sampleSize=48&amp;sampleText=MOVEMENt&amp;sampleSize=48"
    target="_blank"> Berlin Sans</a> maybe has a similar uc &#34;V&#34;, but it&#39;s
    much  <BR>more loose and playful. This one is very strict and restrained. <BR>I
    was thinking of <a href="http://www.playtype.com/" target="_blank"> Playtype</a>
    -- horrible interface, I know -- but  <BR>came up with nothing unfortunately.
