body: "I'm working on a typeface that will be used to display pretty small sizes,
  8-12 pt mostly, and I'm trying to get the hinting right.\r\nAs it stands, the face
  looks very readable and nice in one of the sizes, in the others the x-height fluctuates,
  creating a very irregular horizontal texture. \r\n\r\nI've been trying to figure
  out Type 1 hinting, allthough as of yet the results have been disappointing. Before
  I plunge myself deeper down that rabbit hole, I thought I might ask you guys if
  I should switch to the (seemingly more complex) True type hinting, or if you think
  i should be able to get proper results with T1?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nS."

  body: "To use T1 or TT Hinting depends on the platform where you use the font. For
    Windows you probably need to go for TT hinting, MacOSX is happy with T1.\r\n\r\nFor
    the x-height fluctuation, you need to get the alignments zones right and add some
    ghost hints. \r\n\r\nGeorg"

    and that the implementation does or does not use hints/instructions, ideally before
    you hint anything. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Yes (and no).\r\nThe default build setting is to use its own auto-hinting.
    For those inclined to take a liberal view to copyright issues, you can rebuild
    the library <em>with</em> that version of TT hinting. See [[http://www.freetype.org/patents.html|Freetype
    and Patents]].\r\n\r\nAn overview of hinting technologies can be found one the
    same site: [[http://www.freetype.org/autohinting/data.html|The FreeType Auto-Hinting
    pages]]."
