  be for future typographer and graphic design generations?\r\nWill I am not a fan
  of ITC typefaces, I thought the U&lc magazine design will be remembered in type
  and graphic design history.\r\nWhat was you favorite and least favorite U&lc design
  contributions?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2722157519_90836ff2fd_5552.jpg]"

  body: "I subscribed to <em>U&lc</em> in the 1980s. What vestige of memory I retain
    is not so much of any particular feature's design, illustration or content (although
    they were indispensable to the magazine's glamour), but the experience of receiving
    a very large foundry specimen of new typefaces, regularly, with paragraph showings
    of multiple weights in various sizes. That was the essence of the publication.
    (It was backed up by specimen booklets for each typeface, which I, as an agency
    art director, was given by my type house sales rep on his weekly visits.)\r\n\r\nAs
    a legacy, <em>U&lc</em> is a convenient typographic archive that cements and enhances
    the importance of ITC and its faces during the foundry's heyday, despite their
    spotty reputation subsequently. However, the design work featured is not representative
    of typical design work of the era, or any other era--it is exceptional, \"creative\"
    work (see above) that appeals to the professional metaculture. So with regards
    to its content, the magazine's role in history will be myth-making. \r\n\r\nAdobe's
    <em>Font & Function</em> and Emigre's <em>Emigre</em>, in the 1990s, could be
    compared.\r\n"

    in a big paper bin when i was just throwing away old newspapers. Of course, i
    saved this treasure. The design is a creative playground, not necessarily a mirror
    of its era. But a nice showcase of Ed Benguiat\u2019s work, especially in the
    early issues."

    can now safely assume that the Secret Service has finally taken an interest in
    type. Or has the habit of fowling in dustbins spread to the other inhabitants
    of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesnachrichtendienst|Pullach]], too?\r\n\r\nSCNR\r\nAndreas

    a bin of the village where i grew up, near Lake of Constance. Still being a student
    i was prowling the bins for food, instead i had to live with U&lc!'
