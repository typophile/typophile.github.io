  (great britain). URW Typeworks 1 and 2 are offered for just 30 GBP apiece, which
  is a real bargain. I guess you might become sceptic as these used to cost thousands
  in the early 90s, but I can only say that it's absolutely A OK. They are liquidated
  stock, are new and unopened, and the CDs are still sealed. Both PC and MAC, postscript
  and truetype are available. I work on MAC and it works with no problems whatsoever,
  and the fonts (500 fonts + modifications per set) are high quality, and they come
  with a useful 1000 page reference book with all fonts displayed.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended
  I would say! I wouldn't be trying to sell you something if it wasn't! \r\n\r\nenjoy!
  :-)"

  body: "OK so he used your document, he does not publish fonts for free, he offers
    original sealed retail font packages at a very low price, which seems OK to me,
    seeing they come from a liquidated stock, and the original product is not offered
    new anymore. It seems perfectly OK to me, but of course you don't have to buy
    it if you don't want to... :-) \r\n\r\nMany here have advised to buy used copies
    of CorelDraw! to get the fonts embedded in it. This seems just as right, plus
    these are unused and sealed, so what's the problem?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm not going to start a discussion on piracy here. I know this has been
    and will be a sensitive theme around here, but I think the issue is far too complicated
    to simply say they pirated or not. \r\n\r\nURW and Bitstream digitalized many
    fonts in the early digital era, often for other foundries without such expertise,
    like Berthold, Linotype, ITC etc. URW (which is not the same as URW++, read about
    this elsewhere) offered two price ranges, a cheaper one in which they acquired
    the right to resell, and a more expensive one, where this was not allowed or strongly
    limited (by name change for instance). This is how they acquired the rights to
    the fonts. This is not piracy, rather a smart business strategy. I've read a lot
    about these cases, and this is much different from the likes of SSi, who had no
    right to resell, copied outlines and redistributed under another name, to bypass
    US copyright law. URW developed top quality font software in the seventies, the
    first and at the time best of its kind and many designers and foundries have used
    their expertise and software. The early digital type revolution has created a
    very dodgy mess, with a lot of bankrupties and mergers(Berthold for instance went
    bankrupt, URW later also went into receivership) and a lot of sharks in the water
    to pick up the pieces cheap and resell or redistribute themselves. This and the
    dodgy copyright laws for fonts makes verdicts very difficult to make. I would
    say the URW was on the right side of the spectrum, also because they were deeply
    involved in the beginnings of digital type and making it all happen, assuring
    a high quality standard. They were not in it for a quick buck IMHO. \r\n\r\n@1996type\r\nA
    lot of foundries offer the same fonts at the different prices, under different
    licenses and sometimes different names. But one cannot be called a pirate just
    for selling at a lower price..."

    that URW++ stole his Hotel font (and renamed it Dextor). I don't care if URW++
    uses a smart business strategy, if they were involved in the beginnings of digital

  body: "Incidentally, buying a CD-ROM may not always give you a valid license for
    what is on that CD-ROM, even though the CD-ROM is a genuine original one. For
    example, one might, from some places, purchase a CD-ROM for Corel Draw that was
    to be packaged with a new computer, separately from the computer - and which may
    not be resoled by the purchaser of the computer it came with.\r\n\r\nWhen a CD-ROM,
    although authentic, is being sold at a price far below the original price, the
    possibility that a license condition has been violated, resulting in one not having
    an actual valid license for the software or fonts on it must be taken into consideration."
