body: What might be the font trends for 2011 for magazine articles? Or where can I
  find font trends like I can find colour trends on for example colourlovers.com?
  I need a modern font for a magazine restyling next year.

    designer, not type designer so I guess you should received better answers than
    mine.\r\nBut I just wanted to share my thoughts with you.\r\nIf you could wait
    until January I think you could red some interesting articles from <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/blog/\">FontFont
    blog</a> and John Boardley's blog \"<a href=\"http://ilovetypography.com/\">I
    Love typography</a>\". Both have \"Favourite fonts in year list\" (I think it
    should be published at the beginning of 2011) and would probably be an interesting
    overview of some 2010 typefaces uses.\r\nIf you want to take a look at last year
    list :\r\nFontFont : <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/blog/?cat=76\">Type Trends
    2010: Our Picks for the New Year</a>\r\nILT list : <a href=\"http://ilovetypography.com/2010/01/21/my-favourite-fonts-of-2009/\">My
    favourite fonts of 2009</a>.\r\nI hope it could give you some ideas.\r\n++"

  body: "FontShop has a managed program of font development and release, and probably
    other foundries plan ahead like that. After all, once one has committed to a prototype
    design, it can take many months to produce the full range of fonts for that face,
    with all the language support and OpenType features.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think
    the idea has occurred to anyone in this business that we should \"pre-release\"
    out type plans, to assist designers in coordinating their type choices with other
    aspects of design.\r\n\r\nFear of having some other foundry steal one's thunder
    by rushing a cheap and nasty version of the idea to market (as happens in the
    fashion/clothing industry) is no doubt the reason.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say which
    of the trends popular in 2010 will continue.\r\nI would say wait till all the
    \"Best of 2010\" reviews (especially Typographica) come out, then make your analysis.\r\nYour
    prediction will be as good as the pros.\r\nBesides which, you have the opportunity
    to lead, rather than follow.\r\n"

  body: "Hello, I was reading Computer Arts Project on editorial design which had
    some great insights on a change of fonts/typefaces and layout terms in magazines
    and newspapers. If you are more into the custom type try looking at Los Logo book.
    New trends on typography change depending on the materials, methods and tools
    you use.\r\n\r\nsource:\r\nYou can buy the magazine from Future Publishing \r\nhttp://www.computerarts.co.uk/about_us/latest_issue/computer_arts_projects_issue_141\r\nhttp://www.computerarts.co.uk/about_us/latest_issue/computer_arts_projects_issue_127\r\nhttp://www.computerarts.co.uk/about_us/latest_issue/computer_arts_projects_issue_137\r\n\r\n"
