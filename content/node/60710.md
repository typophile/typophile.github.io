body: "Hey Guys,\r\nI am currently working on my final exam. I made a concept for
  a luxury restaurant with it\u2019s focus on exotic meals from different cultures
  all over the world. The target group mainly consists of people with high income
  and interest in exotic food and culture. The name is Xanadu.Now I\u2019m working
  on the artwork and I was wondering which typeface to choose as corporate type and
  logo type. What do you guys think? Should it bei two different types (logo&corporate
  type) or could the logotype be from the same family? My favorite is the Archer by
  Hoefler & Frere-Jones. I especially like the thin and hairline versions.But I\u2019m
  not sure about using the bold face as a headlinefont. The design should be elegant
  and clean and do not cover the international culture aspect (thats gonna be covered
  by the food).So, what do you guys think about archer as corporate type?Which would
  be a nice additional type?Any other suggestions? \r\nThanks in advance for your
  help!"

  body: "Hehe the problem is,the artwork process is still in the first stadium, so
    i can\u2019t really show some work yet. The overall look&fell is gonna be very
    clean, high-end and representing luxury. The style of images used for advertising
    and other visual touchpoints of the brand should inspire emotion and dreaming
    (dreaming is an important part of a luxury brand) in the recipients.Another idea
    for the artwork is creating a color-code to navigate through the different styles
    of food and their culture. Maybe i can refer to the roots of Xanadu in the logotype.
    Xanadu is first mentioned as the name of Kublai Khans summer residence in one
    of Marco Polo\u2019s diarie. Since then it is a metaphor for wealth and splendor.
    Orson Welles refers to it in his movie Citizen Kane, where Kane\u2019s palace
    is named after it. However, it should speak the language of luxury/premium/high-end.I\u2019m
    sorry i can\u2019t give any further information rightnow\u2026"

    type in 'elegant', 'clean' or other terms into the search field and look at the
    results. You can also enter in the 'Xanadu' name to see exactly how it would appear
    in thousands of different typefaces.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts/com\">MyFonts</a>\r\n\r\nYou

    'Archer' is your favorite, who are we to disagree? :)\r\nBest of luck on your
