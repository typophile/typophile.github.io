  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello typophiles</p>
<p>Im learning the principles of designing a typeface via software assistant. So, when I need to control beziers to make a &lsquo;perfect curve&rsquo; I fail again and again. I know that failing is good, but I think that the position of points and handles have some science on it.</p>
<p>Today I realize something that perhaps could help me, but I dont know if it make sense, have a look:
<img src="/images/old-images/handles_6446.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It seem to me that handles follow a certain logic that we can find in the structure of calligraphic variations…
This make sense to you?</p>
<p>Where do you [typographers] learn the &lsquo;art&rsquo; of place perfect points and handles?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks

<p>To understand how to place your anchor points you must understand at least some basic principles of chirography and stroke modulation. Almost all control points come in <em>pairs</em>: for every point there is an opposite point (cf. the brace in your image) at the parallel curve. If you draw a line across each pair of points, you will find out their angle follows a nearly [[http://typophile.com/node/13877|ductal logic]]. With designs that go apart from chirography the game becomes harder, but to be good at that you first need to fail, again and again, and I can&rsquo;t help you with that.</p>
<p>The principle is the same for the control points: <em>Always</em> think in terms of two lines <em>interacting</em> with each other :-)</p>
<p>I have always seen the &ldquo;put your points in extrema&rdquo; convention as a restraint.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse drawing with -what can quite accurately be called- painting. I draw by hand all the time - it can be wonderfully useful. But we should be drawing the border between black and white, not pairs of lines enclosing the black (which makes no sense functionally, hence is an arbitrary design constraint, a lazy shortcut to nowhere).</p>
<p>Painting only &ldquo;trains your mind and knowledge&rdquo; about type&rsquo;s arbitrary past; when it comes to what function type needs to perform, it can only distract you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re using a broad-nib pen, béziers or a ripe avocado tied to a stick.</p>

<p>Hrant, perhaps you misunderstood me in my last comment. What I intended to say was that, if your design is chirographical, then your anchor points should <em>reflect that logic</em> you have chosen. But there is not and should not be a fixation towards a chirographical logic, or any other logic at all. I completely agree with you in that aspect.</p>
<p>But there <em>is</em> a logic between the two lines that delimit the shape of a letter. If that interrelationship is meaningful in some way, then this shape will be of some value for &ldquo;the mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t understand why you would discourage a chirographical approach by someone who has presumably just started with typography. I assume you didn&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t to discourage the chirographical logic itself (but I may be utterly wrong), but the fixation to that kind of logic. I think it is pretty useful as a starting point, and I also think one has to be careful by making such preclusive statements against chirography, in particular in front of people who do not have any judgement yet. After all, it&rsquo;s better to try to understand Vivaldi and Mozart before trying to understand Thelonius Monk and Keith Jarret.</p>

<p>As for whether a beginner should start with the obvious precedents or not, the problem is this precedent is a bad one (something Vivaldi and Mozart are not). I guess it also depends greatly on the individual beginner: some people are strong enough to turn a bad precedent to their advantage; but some people get hopelessly stuck for the rest of their lives.</p>

I end up using guides to locate the control points and then move the anchor and reposition the control points. It would be incredibly useful to do this for the type of vector work I do for logos and such.</div>

<p>In Fontlab, holding down Alt/Opt while moving a cusp node will move the node while its handles stay in place. Holding down Shift before moving a smooth node will keep the handles in place and constrain the node to the line segment between them. (Shift after you&rsquo;ve picked up the node is your usual rectilinear constraint.) Holding down Alt before moving a smooth node will scale and rotate the handles according to the node&rsquo;s relative position along the curve. Alt after you&rsquo;ve picked up a smooth node will work like it does for a cusp node, creating a false cusp that will spring back to smooth the next time you mess with the handles.</p>

<p>Interesting, and a good catch.  I would say that a lot of the wobbliness is due to the classic cubic spline setup, actually.</p>
<p>Though I prefer to build in Quadratic now, it wasn&rsquo;t always this way.  I started off with the standard cubic spline and editing mode of the default adobe illustrator install, as I would guess most here have.  Pretty much all my work that is out there was made in the cubic world.</p>
<p>I see quadratic as a way to remove the wobliness, actually. When I want to anyway. There is still something to be said for something that looks like it was done by hand and is not perfect, especially in todays digital world.</p>

<blockquote>THE SHAPES OF LETTERS
The shapes of letters do not derive their beauty from any sensual or sentimental reminiscences. No one can say that the O's roundness appeals to us only because it is like that of an apple or of a girl's breast or of the full moon. Letters are things, not pictures of things.
—Eric Gill, <em>Autobiography</em>, Jonathan Cape, London, 1940.</blockquote>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ahem, ahem&hellip; Going back to the actual topic:</p>
<blockquote>the great majority of people seem to prefer cubic béziers</blockquote>
That's because quadratic Bézier curves can only represent segments of a parabola. And only very few curves are parabola, i.e. this is a clear restriction. On the other hand, this is why people may prefer it; parabolæ are per se smooth, "good looking" curves. As there is only one control point, it's seams easy to control the tension/smoothness of the curve, because point with greatest tension (the vertex of the corresponding parabola) seems to follow the control point.
<p>To understand how this point of maximal tension relates to the position of the control point I have written a simple applet which can be found [[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/FocusAndDirectrixInAQuadraticBezierCurve/|here]] (requires <em>Wolfram CDF Player</em>, it&rsquo;s worth it). In addition, I plotted the focus and directrix of the parabola. To explain these terms, loosely speaking, the focus plays the same role in a parabola as the center does in a circle. That means, the further this point is from the curve, the &ldquo;opener&rdquo; it will look. The directrix is the line where the parabola &ldquo;sits&rdquo;. More than that is not necessary to understand how a quadratic Bézier curve works. Play around and see what you find out.*</p>
<p>At this point, my last question becomes interesting. &ldquo;Well, what if you could change the flattness of that quardatic Bézier </em>without</em> changing it&rsquo;s direction?&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s just what so-called <em>rational</em> Bezier curves provide. The result is indeed a much more dynamic curve, which can not only represent parts of a parabola, but also of ellipses and hyperbolas. All three are per definition smooth looking curves; they do not contain any inflection points. In other words, none of them is distortable into a bumpy curve. Ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas together make up the class of the <em>conic sections</em>, the class of utopic curves [angelic voices]. The applet from the link above also implements a rational quadratic Bézier, just change the parameter ω with the slider.</p>
<p>So I asked myself why, for the sake of design, has this not been done before. One answer is that it&rsquo;s unpractical to have an extra parameter ω, which should first easily modifiable. The second, conclusive answer is earned by asking another question. What can cubic Béziers do in comparison to quadratic Béziers? I&rsquo;ll spoil it. Every quadratic Bezier curve can be exactly reproduced by a cubic bezier curve. You just have to place the control points of the cubic curve ⅔ along the &ldquo;handles&rdquo; of the quadratic. Not only that, but also every rational quadratic curve as described above can be drawn by a cubic Bézier, by changing the ratio in which the handle points &ldquo;cut&rdquo; the control polygon of the quadratic Bézier. For example, to draw an elliptic curve you would place the handle points less than ⅔ the distance to the (imaginary) intersection of the two handle lines. To draw an hyperbolic curve you would choose a distance greater than ⅔ (but please still less than the intersection). I have written [[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/RationalCubicBezierCurves/|another applet]] to illustrate this idea as well.</p>
<p>I hope that settles the conflicting speculations of Hrant and David somehow, which I wished to interrupt since the beginning but hadn&rsquo;t had time :-)</p>
<p>Summary and some more ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li> Quadratics Bézier curves can only represent segments of a parabola.</li>
<li> Every quadratic Bézier curve can be reconstructed from a cubic Bézier curve by placing the control points ⅔ of the distance to the (imaginary) intersection of both handle-lines.</li>
<li> If you place the control points at a smaller radio, you get an elliptic curve.</li>
<li> If you place them at a greater ratio, you get a hyperbolic curve.</li>
<li> To know if both control points sit at the same ratio, just check if the imaginary line that passes through the control points is parallel to the imaginary line that passes through the anchor points.</li>
<li> If your "control lines" intersect at at least one your handles, your curve has an inflection point, which you want to avoid.** In every point where the direction (concavity) of the curve changes, there should be a new anchor point.</li>
<li> Separating the control points (maintaining the length of the handles) means making the curve more elliptic. Bringing them closer makes it more hyperbolic.</li>
<li> Not because there's a specific constellation of the Bézier points for obtaining specially "simple" curves does it necessarily mean one should develop such a drawing habit. But if we know beforehand we're going after an outline of that nature, we have such tools at our disposition.</li>
</ul>
________
* Note: the bending energy is a measure of tension.
** Actually, if you go further and create a loop, the inflection points disappear, but recurving serpentines are not what we're looking for.</div>

<p>However, and without trying to agree with David :-) I would say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice-to-look at does not equate to easy-to-make.</li>
<li>It takes more effort to make a cubic act like a quadratic, so why bother?</li>
<li>What about ensuring smoothness across segments? This is especially true of quadratics, where avoiding inflection points simply means those points could/would be between segments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice of you to make those applets - I&rsquo;ll try to install the player to see.</p>

<p>I thought that converting from quadratic to regular bezier could be done flawlessly, although this doesn&rsquo;t always seem to be the case in fontlab.</p>
<p>Techniques used to build something don&rsquo;t have to be the techniques with which it is displayed to the masses, by which I mean building in quadratic and publishing in bezier shouldn&rsquo;t even be something we have to think about.  Instead we should just be able to choose whatever type of curves we want, from bezier to quadratic to spiro, or even raster based &ldquo;paint&rdquo; and not to worry about the translation in to whatever format.</p>
<hr>
<p>An interesting blend of regular bezier and quadratic is to edit a bezier curve, not by moving the control points, but by grabbing the curve itself and moving it around.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that straight lines will ever surpass curves in terms of beauty, but I have been exploring of late how <em>smooth</em> straight lines can look connected together perhaps more obtusely than what one immediately thinks of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just have to place the control points of the cubic curve ⅔ along the &ldquo;handles&rdquo; of the quadratic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This has been clear since the first quadratic drawing tool. 1000&rsquo;s of fonts have been drawn using these tools.</p>
