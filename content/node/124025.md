  body: "My experience is that Nike has a practice of creating its own lettering for
    apparel. \r\nI agree that Consort RR Extra Bold Condensed is a good substitute.\r\nConsort
    was a revival by Stephenson Blake in 1956 of the Clarendon of 1845 in regular
    and condensed widths with additional weights. Steve Jackaman's digital version
    is well made.\r\nAs far as I can determine, other retail Clarendons do not have
    a combination of width and weight that is as close as Consort RR Extra Bold Condensed.\r\nDon"

  body: "Egyptienne is not a Clarendon but has a serif design similar to Clarendon,
    but based on a thicker serif of similar length.\r\nI agree that  Egyptienne Condensed
    Bold is closer than Consort RR Extra Bold Condensed to the Nike apparel lettering.\r\nDon"
