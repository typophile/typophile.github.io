  body: "To me it looks like a widened, customized version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/handel-gothic/|Handel
    Gothic]] with a more conventional E. The R, G and K are right, and the segmented
    look would be easy to create. This may not actually be the way it was created,
    but it should work as a way to re-create it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    That font does look perfect with those segmentations! An exact match! \r\n\r\nJust
    wanted to update you that I heard back from the guy who designed the logo at minus-3.net
    and he disclosed the font type as GOOD TIMES --> http://www.dafont.com/good-times.font\r\n\r\n"
