  prophet (in New Zealand, obviously). The lettering stlye seems to be of some european
  inspiration... celtic, maybe? It looks quite familiar, but I can't quite pick it.
  It is quite inconsistent, but I recognise some character designs, and would appreciate
  if anyone could point me in the right direction for other source material.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n-
  Chris"
