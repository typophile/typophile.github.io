body: "Hello,\r\nI am looking for a digital font that is close to this sample, printed
  from metal letters. The lowercase \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019 are pretty distinctive.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gothic_3475.gif]\r\nI
  found <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atgothic-extended/\">AT Gothic
  Extended</a> from Agfa/Monotype \u2013 which actually is very good. Alas, there
  seems to be only one single weight available (Extra Light). Do you know a font with
  a similar appearance that has more styles?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nFlorian\r\n\r\nedit:
  I came across <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/adrianna/\">Adrianna</a>.
  It offers a wider range in weights, but has some disadvantages, too: considerably
  smaller x-height and some wayward characters: c, e, g for example.\r\nAnd I saw
  <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/38174\">this old thread on Splendid Grotesk</a>
  \u2013 Erkki, are you still around?"
