  body: I just downloaded and it's lovely! Mark put a lot of love into this -- on
    top of being well-drawn, the spacing is right on. All the bells and whistles,
    too. This would make a killer font choice for a magazine.

  body: "Thanks, guys. I hope this is an indication of how well it will be received.\r\n\r\nI've
    been wanting to revamp Proxima Sans for years, and boy am I relieved it's finally
    finished. Now I can work on something else for a while. :-)"

  body: "I spent a lot of time working out the small caps. Small caps for sans serif
    fonts are somewhat unusual, so I was not quite sure how best to proceed. Choosing
    the small cap height turned out to be trickier than getting the weight to balance
    well with the caps. \r\n\r\nAt first they were going to be just a hair larger
    than the lowercase. I did it that way because in my research most of the other
    examples I found did it that way. It didn't feel quite exactly right to me, but
    they were done, they were okay, and I really didn't want to go back and start
    all over. \r\n\r\nThen there was a discussion on Typophile (about four or five
    months ago I think) about the confusion that can arise with plural acronyms set
    in small caps with a lowercase \"s\" when they are close to the same height. It
    convinced me that it was worth redoing them. So I did, and I'm really glad I did."

    caps with sans serif fonts.  Too often I have to create or correct them myself
    since there are so few that are as well done as yours.  Darn it! Now (broke as
    I am) I will have to go out and buy your font!\r\n\r\nVery nice work :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
