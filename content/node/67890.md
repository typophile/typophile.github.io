  Recently we've been working on a identity for a hydrologist. We picked \"Purista\"
  as a leading typeface. It was ment mostly for stationery and hydrologic reports
  \u2013 both headlines and body text and we're happy with it's tech look. Unfortunately,
  we encountered a serious issue with mathematical symbos and greek, wich Purista
  does not support. \r\n2) As the logo is much in sync with purista, we should stick
  with that one (a very close inexpensive match with support for what we need would
  be as perfect as is non-existent)\r\n\r\n3) There's no budget for any high-end,
  multi purpose killer bundles.\r\n\r\n4) The reports will we written in MS Word,
  so any complex system would fail as the person wouldn't use a combination of more
  than two fonts (more than one in body text including the math).\r\n\r\nbecause of
  the above, our solution was to come up with a text face with CE, math and greek
  support that we will use for both body and equations and due to the fact that any
  other sans badly interferes with purista - we decided to go for a serif \u2013 preferably
  something free (either TeX, ghostscript, windows, office or whatever \u2013 you
  got the picture...)\r\n\r\n...And the only somewhat working solution was...(drums
  rambling)...Cambria... \r\nPlease let me know what do you think about the choice
  and the problem itself, any clues and ideas \u2013 much appreciated.\r\n\r\nA good,
  modern face that is math\u2013capable is a subject for separate thread i think \u2013
  do You know any ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and see you later."
