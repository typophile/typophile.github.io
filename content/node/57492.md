  rework, but this goes a step further and takes Gill and tortures it into gimmicky
  shapes for no particular reason. Look at 'submit Forum topic' - up and down all

  body: I think it's interesting -- it seems to have some elements of some of the
    earlier Emigre typefaces like Manson/Mason, with a hint of Electrix and Lunatix.
    I think I'd like Vidage more if it was more its own thing, and didn't have characters
    that look so much like Gill (in particular, the lowercase "t").

    I'm reluctant to believe there is no point behind its range of differing structures.
    \r\n\r\nSome details are awesome &ndash; I am very excited about its \"g\". And
    the \"q\" is interesting too. And the \"M\" seems very Jack Usine. \r\nTo my eye,
    they just all seem to belong to slightly different fonts. :-\\\r\n"

    you need a lowercase character or two."

    allows me to appreciate why someone would design a font like this, why he thought
    that there are designers who might use it, and why he thought people wouldn\u2019t
    have too much trouble reading it when they encounter it. I still wouldn\u2019t
    use Vidange\u2014it just isn\u2019t my cup of rather orderly tea. But, having
    seen the photos that inspired it, I\u2019m sure that there are plenty of designers
    in France who would just love to use Vidange. "

    it starts to look awesome as well.\r\n\r\nExcept for Vidange, which I don't think
    is that great because it doesn't look like it works for anything other than English
    Choral music filtered through a ring harmonizer.\r\n\r\nAnd that, my friends,

  body: "Me likes. Bucketloads. Fresh and unexpected. Puts you on the wrong foot;
    a sneaky, clever design. It is what it is -- no explanation needed, although knowing
    the cultural background is a nice bonus. Jack Usine is an original voice, and
    people comparing him to Barnbrook are only skimming the surface, they don't look
    closely enough. It's like saying TheSerif is too similar to PMN Caecilia. It only
    does so on the surface -- TheSerif is a decidedly masculine design while PMN Caecilia
    is unmistakenly feminine. Look closer.\r\n\r\nThree days a go I went to a <a ref=\"http://www.helsen-williams.be/helsen/index.html\">Wim
    Helsen</a> show, a brilliant Belgian stand-up comedian (although he does defy
    categorisation). Amongst the jokes and physical comedy there are some awkward
    and even truly painful moments, plus he gives the audience quite a bit of existential
    stuff to reflect upon. If you are a softie like me by the end you'll have shed
    the odd emotional tear. People could argue that he failed as a stand-up comedian,
    because when you leave you realise you only laughed two-thirds of the time. But
    then it hits you that more than just laughing you have <em>felt</em> something,
    genuine emotions; that your heart is restless, that you want to do something,
    also with your life, and three days later you still have that existential stuff
    rummaging through your head.\r\n\r\nI like type that makes me <em>feel</em> something.
    I don't know yet what I could use Vidange for, but boy does it make me feel alive."
