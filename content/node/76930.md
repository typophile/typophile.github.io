  publications for the Third Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. I've previously posted
  a request over at myfonts.com, but have had no real success there; as indicated
  in my more recent post there, I'm starting to think that the font may not exist,
  or may have been developed for in-house use only and (gasp!) never leaked to the
  public by *anyone*! ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/321958/\">here's
  the link to the image and original Request For Identification (RFI) over at myfonts.com</a>.
  Many thanks in advance for anything anyone can find!"

    instead of on another site:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_small_6297.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!
    I have a bigger image if it helps (this one's scaled down 50% from the original
    for ease of posting)."
