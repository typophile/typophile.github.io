<p>if you&rsquo;re applying for an open position, it&rsquo;s probably not that important. they will review your cover letter/resume, portfolio (if asked for yet) and decide who to call in for interviews.</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re fishing, if you&rsquo;re going around doing informational interviews, if the position you want isn&rsquo;t open at the moment (or doesn&rsquo;t officially exist yet), then a biz card could be effective, because in that case, you wanna keep your name in the minds of the powers that be. cards go into wallets, beside computer monitors, in roledex files, etc. etc.  they are another opportunity for your name to come up when the time is right.</p>

Although the &ldquo;look&rdquo; has to reflect what you offer as a designer (high costs?), you don&rsquo;t have to spend a lot on such a thing&hellip; Cards are mostly valuable for what they are, not for the features in their presentation.</p>
<p>Anyway, people ARE sensible to these kind of promotion, so I&rsquo;d rather have a simple nice card than none at all. I personally prefer creative and economic approaches, because as I see it they tend to reflect more of what one is and can do.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">A business card is a must. You never know who you are going to meet. It&rsquo;s vital to have a card you can hand someone with your web site, phone number, and email address. It&rsquo;s less important once you have the interview but it can&rsquo;t hurt. You&rsquo;re better off with something simple, now, than waiting for your fancy die-cut card.</div>

Design firms may or may not have a job posted, but they&rsquo;re nearly always willing to make room for the right person because they&rsquo;re so hard to find.</p>
<p>Once you have the interview, if the resume isn&rsquo;t stellar and the portfolio is just okay, a personal card will not win you more points.</p>
<p>However, if you have a great resume and your portfolio is solid then giving me a business card makes it easier to get in touch with you. In that case it&rsquo;s a bonus, but still not necessary.</p>

Work samples and contact info in an e-mail is enough. BUT if the person does have a card it MUST look very good. Not a conceptual wonder and I don&rsquo;t care much for fancy die-cut stuff and lots of colours, but impeccable typographically and maybe with a hint of character. For me it&rsquo;s an extension of the portfolio, and rather than show up with something half decent, don&rsquo;t bring it at all. The same goes for the portfolio. I don&rsquo;t want to see work done if it isn&rsquo;t something the person showing the portfolio really likes her- or himself. Show less, rather than too much.</p>

Less is more! Make sure everything is tops or leave it out.
I go through tons of folios though so a businesscard for me is a good way of remebering the person and the folio.</p>
<p>Are you doing your folio available in a handy digital format? Make sure you do. Paper float around a busy office environment and will sooner or later be likely to disappear. Most agencys who speak to jobseakers regularly have a space on their server for folios where they can go back and find an appropriate candidate when the need presents itself. Make sure you&rsquo;re in that pile.</p>

There is also a case of never being happy or sure that what you have done for yourself, and the process tends to drag on, you need to get going the longer your out the harder it gets to get back in.
Send examples of your work by email or post this works better, send relevant pieces of work not random. Emails are sometimes better and people tend not to delete emails and they can find you again if you have made an impact. This way people can see how you would fit in. If there is a opportunity going then they will remember you and give you a call.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get full time then freelance. Get your name of freelanceuk.com if your in the UK.</p>
<p>As Endre did make something that will be useful and standout, possibly instead of a business card to give yourself a better chance of staying away from that draw.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">like i said, if you&rsquo;re fishing, you need a card. if you already have an interview, i don&rsquo;t think it makes much difference one way or the other, except as one more thing for an hr staff to keep track of.
i&rsquo;ve interviewed people who gave me their cards, and ONLY if it&rsquo;s terrific did it make a good impression. if i&rsquo;ve just spent time talking with a candidate, hearing why they&rsquo;re perfect for such and such creative position, and then they hand me a card that falls short, it probably hurts more than no card at all.</div>

I recommend these folks for affordable eco-friendly cards printing with die-cuts, soy inks, and recycled stocks&hellip;. as well as for just being rad: <a href="http://www.pinballpublishing.com">http://www.pinballpublishing.com</a></div>
