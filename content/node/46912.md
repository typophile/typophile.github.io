body: "Having a problem with straight/\u2019curly\u2019 quotation marks. When text
  is copied and pasted into the template and styled, it retains curly apostrophes
  etc \u2013 but when typed directly into Indesign, it only uses straight punctuation.
  An Adobe help search suggested turning \u2018Use Typographer\u2019s marks\u2019
  on/off (under preferences>type) but this doesn\u2019t make a difference.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be most appreciated.\r\n"
