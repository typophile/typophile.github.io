    there is any improvement.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a law passed on how many
    SUVs are allowed on the road at once. Or maybe SUVs can only drive in the outside
    lane. \r\n\r\nTechnically this should be a NEWS post or in the RELEASE area. :^/

    I vote for reducing the jury to six people.\r\nOr actually, one fewer people than
    it is now.  :-)\r\n\r\nAs for banning SUVs, I can't stand them just as\r\nmuch
    as any of you, but I think we need to focus\r\non the disease and not get overly
    distracted by\r\nthe symptoms. For one thing, many people are\r\nnow motivated
