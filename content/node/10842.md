    and two variants on upper case &#34;Y&#34;. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t yet decided
    what to do about upper case &#34;W&#34; as yet. See what you think about the glyph
    in the text setting below. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s worth noting that the Seriatim family
    is a geometric sans serif, and Seriatim Uncial is an uncial variation, still within
    the constraints of geometric sans serif form. To that end, What may seem wide
    or otherwise out of sorts for a standard uncial font might seem to fit in the
    context of the geometry of the rest of the Seriatim family &#40;showing in the
    Sans Serif and Experimental Forums&#41;. <BR> <BR>Numerals, full punctuation,
    full standard ligatures, etc. are forthcoming, and will be posted as soon as possible.

  body: David, <BR> <BR>I have to say that in both the Gaelic and English settings,
    it looks great. I think it reads especially well in Gaelic and the only thing
    that&#39;s really jumping out at me is the lowercase &#39;b&#39;. In this context,
    the wide &#39;m&#39; looks just fine and I love the &#39;a&#39;. <BR>The new Uppercase
    &#39;H&#39; and &#39;Y&#39; are better but I still think an ascender would work
    better both on the &#39;H&#39; and &#39;K&#39;. I won&#39;t say anything about
    the &#39;W&#39;. <BR> <BR>Bravo. <BR> <BR>

    extenders in this design seem unusually long for an uncial. the bottom of the
    bowl on the lowercase g also could stand to be a little lower.

    I think the font has a problem with spotty color. Some glyphs are clotting a lot
    - like with the &#34;b&#34;, &#34;k&#34; and &#34;r&#34; you could leave the left
    end of the h-bar disconnected. Also, the &#34;y&#34; seems too big. Lastly, I
    think those bars on &#34;H&#34; and &#34;K&#34; are too strong. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    like more of, it would be for the typeface to have more of a calligraphic feel.
    The way the bottom of the bowl of the &#34;P&#34; meets the stem seems extremely
    artificial, and on another font -- perhaps one without such a distinct historical
    reference -- that might be expected. But my overall opinion is that it&#39;s quite
    lovely.

    I like the &#34;W&#34; as is it, but I agree  <BR>that it might be too unconventional
    to modern  <BR>eyes to be useful in all cases. So, as happens  <BR>with so many
    of my fonts, I&#39;m creating an <BR>alternates set. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I&#39;ll have an update showing  <BR>new additions, like
    numerals, punctuation  <BR>and ligatures, as well as many of the  <BR>alternates
    that have suggested themselves  <BR>so far, posted soon.  <BR>  <BR>I also took
    John Baichtal&#39;s comments to mean <BR>that the bowl of the upper-case &#34;P&#34;
    closes too  <BR>close to the stem, so I opened that up slightly.  <BR>I&#39;ve
    also taken Hrant&#39;s advice concerning the  <BR>lower-case &#34;b&#34;, &#34;k&#39;
    and &#34;r&#34;, and opened up the  <BR>middle crossbar.  <BR>  <BR>As for the
    upper-case &#34;H&#34; and &#34;K&#34;, I&#39;m going to  <BR>place the current
    designs in the alternates set  <BR>and try Matha&#39;s advice to use extenders  <BR>instead
    of the top bars in the main set.  <BR>  <BR>John Butler&#39;s advice on the lower-case
    &#34;g&#34;  <BR>was also taken to heart, although the bowl  <BR>problem is largely
    caused by an optical  <BR>illusion due to the lower-case &#34;f&#34;. I&#39;m  <BR>re-examining
    the &#34;f&#34;, and I may raise its <BR>crossbar off of the baseline.  <BR>  <BR>Paul:
    See what you think of the new lower-  <BR>case &#34;b&#34;. Does it need a spur
    on the lower-  <BR>left? I&#39;ve been trying to avoid that, but I may  <BR>have
    to relent and include it.  <BR>  <BR>Watch for an image in the next few hours.  <BR>  <BR>David'

  body: I didn&#39;t get as much done on this today as I&#39;d hoped, but there&#39;s
    enough to show most of the changes and additions. I still have some of the punctuation
    and reference characters &#40;such as the section symbol and the pilcrow, et al&#41;
    to complete, and that pesky alternate upper-case &#34;W&#34; &#40;which will probably
    be a ligature of two &#34;V&#34;s&#41;. <BR> <BR>Another change is the upper-case
    &#34;S&#34; and lower-case &#34;s&#34;, which are both no longer as squished-looking
    as they were. They are both based on a circle now, and have essentially been lifted
    directly out of a yin-yang symbol that has been rotated 45 degrees. <BR> <BR>More

    odd. --- I wouldn&#39;t add any &#34;calligraphy&#34; to this. I think one reason

    Bravo. <BR> <BR>There is something you might think about, though, maybe for the

    a lot of people often get the &#39;s&#39; and the &#39;r&#39; mixed up. I&#39;m
    working on a font with a colleague at the moment and we&#39;re trying to distinguish
    our long &#39;s&#39; and &#39;r&#39; from each other as much as possible. Giving
    a curve to the descender on the &#39;s&#39; is one possibility we&#39;ve come

    be very useful. Apart from what Vincent Morely is doing, Gaelic typography is
    very much focused on the past. There is an enormous need for display fonts, screen
    fonts, fonts for signage, as well as italics, small caps and bold...but everyone
    seems to be busy digitising old book fonts. Things have gotten so bad that they&#39;re
