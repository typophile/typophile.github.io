body: ' Has anyone come across any typefaces derived from tattoo flash?  <BR> <BR>This
  is the first sketch I&#39;ve developed. I think I may make it a little more structurd
  yet. I am also playing withthe idea of doing condensed and extended versions as
  well as a symbols set. ie. classic tattoo designs. I have yet to find any face like
  this but would like to know if there is anything else like it. Let me know. Thanks. '

  body: ' Very nice. Very human. <BR>I especially like the regular and bold version.
    <BR>The open could need some work, but it&#39;s nice. <BR>I like the idea of dropping
    the &#34;J&#34;, but it looks a bit to narrow &#40;the part below the baseline&#41;.
    <BR>Other than that. It looks hilarious! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    font for a few months now. I&#39;ve developed a &#34;look&#34; for it but haven&#39;t
    finished fleshing out &#40;no pun intended&#41; the forms. <BR> <BR>The A is definitely
    a classic standard in what I&#39;ve found otherwise I&#39;ll send you a gif of
    it so you know our faces are certainly different. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' Thats awesome. I&#39;d love to see what your doing with it. I was sure somewhere
    there was someone with similiar sensibilities.  <BR> <BR>Amazingly I found nothing
    while looking through books and magazines on tattoos for the last few years. But
    the tattoo scene is not exactly the most refined when it comes to the design of
    their books and magazines.  <BR> <BR>I am using a few different inspirations.
    One being Sailor Jerry&#39;s work. A sheet of Flash that a friend of mine uses
    in his shop and a slew of other tattooist writing styles. Ive found the lc difficult
    withthe same rules that Ive developed for the UC. I&#39;ll post those when I&#39;m
    further along. '
