  body: Nice, Yves, but I don&#39;t see this forum as a  <BR>competition between users.
    I like the ID threads  <BR>because it&#39;s mostly a challenge to myself. <BR>
    <BR>I am ready, anyway... :-&#41;

    the race, when the e-mail notification comes in and <BR>you try to keep the ID
    time under 10 minutes... ;&#41;
