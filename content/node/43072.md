body: Hi, Ive seen Avant Garde with a tilted A done in headings and cant find it,
  does anyone know how to get it? also the TH's that are done, are they legatures
  of some sort, or are they just customised? thanks..

    Garde Alternates, done by Elsner + Flake. Personally, I think this can turn into
    an easy solution to make things look \"custom,\" when it probably would look better
    to just leave it as normal characters. A lot of fashion/lifestyle mags have used
    this over the past few years, many in a cheap and lazy way, so tread with caution."

    Lubalin's original vision of how the font should be used?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Avant/Avant2.html\r\n"

  body: "I don't want to disparage Herb Lubalin's original, or Elsner+Flake's recreation/reinterpretation/revival
    (choose your term depending on your age). \r\n\r\nI do want to disparage its overuse
    in recent years, though. The slanted A can work really well at the beginning of
    a word, but when designers put it in the middle of a word following a letter like
    L or H, it seems likely a deadly weapon in the hands of a child. Like I said,
    you have to be careful with it, and we've all seen examples of Avant-Garde Alternates
    in recent years where people used it inappropriately. I work largely in the action
    sports industry, so I've seen such horrible usages of it I want to punch blindly
    at the air."

  body: Richard -- I should mention I've seen some really awesome usages of Avant-Garde
    with alternates. Very few. It really depends on the word. If you've seen Helvetica,
    the movie, several people point out its solidness, how it lives in a defined space.
    Almost any letter combination will work. Avant-Garde is the complete opposite
    -- it only works for the right word. Most type sellers and foundries have type
    testing apps on their site, so try your word(s) out before you buy.

  body: HA! its my birthday today and i got Helvetica on DVD. havent watched it yet
    tho.. I fully agree with you, ive seen words written in avant garde, and been
    amazed at how beautiful they look, and also the opposite.. i must say tho, i dont
    think ive seen a word look better in Avant garde than 'avant garde'..

  body: "As Herb himself pointed out, the whole typeface was designed to be suitable
    for one thing, and one thing alone -- writing 'Avant Garde' in caps.\r\n\r\nThe
    recent abuse of what is a fantastic typeface (if used well) is painful to see."

  body: When it's done well... it's one of the best ever. Any font can be used poorly,
    but very few have the potential of Avant Garde (at least for display purposes).
    Who said great design should be easy?
