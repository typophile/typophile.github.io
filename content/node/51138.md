  body: i think Jan was right about it being a custom mark, but wrong about it being
    Underware. House had this on some lovely tees (which seem to be all sold out now,
    aaarrrgh!) and they still have some in metal, it looks like. Don't think there
    is a digital version publicly available :P

    I think I read about it being custom.\r\nToo bad I didn\u2019t remember correctly
    who did it ;-)"
