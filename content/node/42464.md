  body: "First list: delete Clarendon (of no importance whatever) and add: Sabon,
    Galliard, and Janson. The first two kicked off the typhoon of new tyefaces in
    our era--more instant classics since 1970 than in the entire history of movable
    type until then. And Janson has been a consistent winner in book design, if nowhere
    else.\r\n\r\nYour distinction between classic and contemporary is somewhat pointless:
    a first-rate new face aims to become a timeless classic, as Sabon and Galliard
    certainly have.\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget to give credit to the foundry ITC, which
    since the late sixties revived interest in typography as a living growing creative
    medium open to newcomers, well before digital and Postscript. Adobe moved into
    a field fertilized and sown by ITC. "

    with oversized x-heights.

  body: 'ITC did two things wrong: they did bastardize Garamond with a version with
    really bad proportions and too much x-height, though the condensed form worked
    nicely. And they wasted their time on a series of text faces actually designed
    for advertising instead of editorial use, like Berkeley Oldstyle, where the first
    weight is too light for editorial text and the next weight up is too heavy. Yet
    we all learned from these mistakes. Denying the importance of ITC in type history
    is like denying the importance of George Balanchine in ballet.'

  body: "I think it only natural to add either Avenir or Gotham (both may be repetitive)
    to the contemporary list. Then again, Frutiger (the man, myth, legend) could own
    that list with Univers as well, which I think, needs to be there. I was under
    the impression that Frutiger (the typeface) was very influential as well. Akzidenz
    may belong somewhere, and DIN is big too, but I've only been a professional designer
    for two years, so maybe I don't know fad from movement yet. Consider my suggestions
    as something for consideration.\r\n\r\nI second Caledonia from Robert. Dwiggins
    Represent!"
