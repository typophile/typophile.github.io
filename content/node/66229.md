body: "Welcome to our first newsletter this decade! :)\r\n\r\nThese fonts were reworked
  during the second half of 2009, but as I presented the Geometry Soft Pro family
  in a separate newsletter I thought I'd wait a little while to present the rest of
  the fonts from that period. Here they are! ;)\r\n\r\nIn this news release I present
  9 fonts:\r\n- 2 from Kimberly Geswein\r\n- 2 (related) from Kevin King\r\n- 1 from
  Derek Vogelpohl\r\n- 1 from Nick Curtis\r\n- 1 from Levente Halmos\r\n- 1 from \"newcomer\"
  Paul Lloyd\r\n- 1 large family from myself! ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-10-01_3871.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nPaul
  Lloyd approached me some time ago and offered his free fonts for reworking, and
  I gladly took him onboard. He has many lovely \"old\" fonts, but with their very
  limited character set they take some time to rework to the quality I want the CheapProFonts
  fonts to have. The first finished one is the swashbuckling Boister Black Pro - and
  I finished it just in time to use it on my own christmas e-card. More to come, indeed!
  :)\r\n\r\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType and TrueType
  fonts for setting \"foreign\" languages (languages requiring more than the basic
  A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\r\nCheck our site for constant
  new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\r\n\r\nRoger S. Nelsson\r\n--
