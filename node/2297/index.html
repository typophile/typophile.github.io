		<div class="commentbody">The color combo and layout seems awfully familiar. IIRC there's a similar logo in use by some IT or management consulting outfit but I can't for the life of me remember which&hellip;not terribly helpful, I suppose, but maybe something to research if you haven't. Or not. <BR> <BR>On a more substantive note, I agree with Eduardo regarding Cocon, though I also like Dutch 809, modulo the ampersand which isn't among my favorites. <BR> <BR>The symbol has been approved, so I probably should keep my mouth shut. Discretion, however, is not one of my virtues. So, what is it? How does it relate to coaching?  <BR> <BR>(aside: am I the only one whose skin crawls upon reading/hearing that word? too much time on Ryze and eCademy amongst the throngs of 'life coaches', perhaps) <BR> <BR>Back to substance, I'm not feeling any real relationship between it and the type in any of the  mooted solutions. Perhaps it should be closer to the type? The two elements just seem to me to 'float' in space. I'd try mucking with both larger and smaller text and see what that does. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey. <BR> <BR>The Cocon definitely gives a more informal feel, it's warmer. But is it just me, or does it feel like it's leaning to the left? I think the logo is pulling it some, and combined with the terminals&hellip; <BR> <BR>Is it heresy to suggest putting a few degrees of right lean into it to optically straighten it? <BR> <BR>I do like the logo.

		<div class="commentbody">Cocon rules. <BR> <BR>Bloemsma has in fact been fighting the backwards lean in his design style for a while - and with Avance has found one solution. But a few degrees is too much, try half or one degree. Syntax for example leans forward by half a degree, while Seria's &quot;upright italic&quot; leans by [an average of] one. <BR> <BR>That's unless you want to make the lean visible. In that case I've found that about 3 degress is the comfortable minimum (at normal reading sizes). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
