  body: Julie could you post a jpg or gif. I&#39;m on a Mac and bmp&#39;s are unreadable
    for me.

    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>Not sure, but the angle makes me think it&#39;s hand-drawn.
    I could be wrong.

  body: I feel like I&#39;ve seen it before. <a href="http://www.letterspace.com/LETTERPERFECT_FONTS/tomboy.htm">Tomboy</a>
    isn&#39;t it, but it may be close enough for your purposes. Mark Simonson&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/felttiproman.html">Felt Tip Roman</a>
    may also be of interest, but it&#39;s not very close to this sample.

  body: I feel like I&#39;ve seen it before too. That&#39;s probably why I&#39;ve
    spent the last two days looking for it. I wish I found this forum sooner. <BR>I
    could probably start with Tomboy and covert it to outlines and try to get it a
    little closer to what I have.  <BR>Appreciate the help. <BR>Thanks! <BR>Julie

  body: I think it&#39;s Letraset Van Dijk, with the Z rotated a bit.

  body: I&#39;m not so sure -- the ends look rounded on the sample, and the strokes
    look like they have an arc to them that neither Van Dijk nor Tomboy has.

    Van Dijk</a> also comes really close.

  body: Well.....after a week and a half of the customer sending jpgs, gifs, bmps
    and then saying that&#39;s all they had, searching font site after site and finally
    ending up here, they just sent me the text in outlines and guess what? They changed
    the font on the EZ. Not even close. <BR> <BR>Just wanted to say thanks, I appreciate
    the help. <BR>
