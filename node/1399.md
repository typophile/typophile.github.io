  thought of helping to elevate the knowlege of DTP font junkies who don&#39;t know
  what they&#39;re downloading. My thought is to have someone that really knows what
  they are talking about take 1 or 2 of those free/shareware fonts per week and let
  those of us that can&#39;t see the little bump on the diagonal stroke of a K what&#39;s
  good or bad about that font. <BR>  <BR>Of, course, I would recommend using the ones
  that weren&#39;t obviously bad. <BR> <BR>I realize that most of you that visit this
  site are type experts, but I&#39;ve seen &#40;and posted&#41; some questions that
  indicate a lack of expertise in the fine points of type. A lot of &#34;Susie/Sam&#34;
  secretary types are being forced to produce things that they have absolutely no
  training for. Think about all those horrible websites you&#39;ve visited with 50
  different fonts and not a single headline kerned. UGH! <BR> <BR>Some of the free
  fonts appear to be really good in their photoshop rendition at the download but
  print awful when you use them. Maybe also include things like what&#39;s the difference
  between using a Bitstream font vs a Pizzadude font that look about the same. Maybe
  I&#39;m the only font junkie who knows enough to be dangerous but not enough to
  know the difference between dentation and hinting. &#40;Okay, I know the difference,
  but I looked it up&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I know quite a bit on how to design with type,
  but maybe not why mixing a slab serif with grotesque is visually pleasing. Instead
  of trying every font in my repertoire which, believe me, can take hours; I, and
  possible others as well, might like to know why they work together. Therefore  being
  able to make more informed type choices the next time they&#39;re asked to design
  work. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s just an idea to help raise the bar of good design and type
  usage. Any thoughts?

    and feel like a rank amateur &#40;though a dedicated one&#41; in the presence
    of some highly skilled professionals. It would be really nice to have some kind
    of Good Font Bad Font clinic and maybe PDFs that go along with each. <BR> <BR>As
    for your closing idea about type selection maybe some of the professionals could
    outline their processes and they could all be published in one place, and people
    could see and try different selection methods. The Type Selection Advisor... <BR>
    <BR>I realize that any of this takes a lot of work and not a little co-ordination.
    Maybe these are two subjects for Typophile Courses? Maybe they are something else.  <BR>

  body: bj, Thanks for the reading list! I&#39;ll add the ones that I haven&#39;t
    already read &#40;gratifyingly few&#41; to my list. typographi.ca is on my list
    and so is Briem. I have been using the Books section here as a checklist already.
    <BR> <BR> I think that I like Dawn&#39;s idea of Good Type Bad Type so much because
    &#40;as I understand it&#41; she&#39;s asking for very specific examples. The
    only example I have seen of a comparison between a Good Type and a rip-off is
    in <i>Branding With Type</i> from Adobe press and it has only a single example,
    useful but not detailed. I imagine comparisons of set text, and detailed close-ups
    on the parts of the letterforms as is regularly done in the Critiques forums.
    <BR> <BR>Bringhurst is the only one I have read so far that expresses his approach
    to type selection, not counting Tschihold&#39;s simple perscription in <i>The
    New Typography</i>. I know there will be more information about selecting type
    as I continue my research and education, but what do <i>you</i> do? <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again for your suggestions. <BR> <BR>Jon

    is a thread of a college student trying to find out the impact of type. Type is
    no longer restricted to print, it is a myriad of multifaceted tentacles that reach
    everywhere. And many of us out here are one man bands. I design, program, write,
    self-train, purchase, install and support everything I do from my kitchen table.
    If you design in a workplace, you can go to the cubicle next to you and white
    board with the designer next to you.  <BR> <BR>The value and the talent that is
    available at this site in incredible. The opportunity to learn from some of the
    best in the field is exciting and humbling. I&#39;d love to be able to read every
    book on typography, web design, css, html programming, javascripting, network
    solutions, etc. to do my job properly, but if you check some of my postings, I
    really need that hour of sleep. I admit I understand type and have several books
    not just on typography but the history of type as well, but it&#39;s not MY area
    of expertise. In addition, I and others in my same situation just don&#39;t have
    the time to do our work and read every new book on the market and decide which
    book has good info and which one doesn&#39;t. Sometimes 20 min online can educate
    me as much as spend 2 days reading a huge book. Resources are the key to doing
    great design, and after 20 years of doing graphics and pc admin, these resources
    provide inspiration and an opportunity to learn no ways to improve my work! <IMG
