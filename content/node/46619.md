  body: "Hi Mandelbort,\r\nwelcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a list of script
    typefaces. I\u2019m not saying that they are particularly similar to your sample,
    because that heavily depends on whether you want to emulate the overall appearance,
    whether you\u2019re looking for the same writing tool or for certain letterforms.
    Scripts are quite unique.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Brush+Script&site=d&sample_text=Padres&sample_size=96\">Brush
    Script</a> is an old fart. [[Mark Simonson]]\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/mark_simonson/kinescope/?sample_text=Padres&sample_size=144\">Kinescope</a>
    is a lot nicer. So is [[Tomas Brousil]]\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/suitcase/bistroscript_regular/?sample_text=Padres&sample_size=144\">Bistro
    Script</a>. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/la_salle_regular_ot/?sample_text=Padres&sample_size=144\">La
    Salle</a>.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=27\">Las
    Vegas Fabulous</a> by [[House Industries]]. Their <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/news/2008Results/Sable.html\">Sable</a>
    wil be released soon. \r\nLetterheadfonts have several script fonts, American
    style, too: <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ballparkscript.shtml\">Ball
    Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/mariescript.shtml\">Marie</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/cosmiccursive.shtml\">Cosmic Cursive</a>.
    And FontBros offer <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=ALSO-MESR\">Metroscript</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=BLVI-PASC\">Parsley
    Script</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=SIDE-COSE\">Coffee
    Service</a>, among others.\r\nTwo more essential addresses for nice retro and
    not-so-retro script fonts: <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/\">Sudtipos</a> and
    <a href=\"http://www.fontdiner.com/\">Fontdiner</a>.\r\nF"
