  care brand.\r\nWe will go on a ligth sans serif, with high x-heigth for the main
  articles description.\r\nThe pages will have some background pictures (usualy ligth
  colors)- so we need a ligth sans with some \"strength\".\r\nWe are considering Koz
  Gothic for this.\r\nDo you guys have some considerations to make? Suggestions and
  some serif pair? \"Good examples\"?\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio FOnseca"
