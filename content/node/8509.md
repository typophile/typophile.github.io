body: I just got the new Print mag in the mail today and I have to say I am extremely
  impressed with the new design from pentagram and the use of the modified Gotham
  typeface from Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad it has a cleaner
  look and the content has jumped in quality as well. <BR> <BR>&#42;sigh of relief&#42;

    or the us one &#40;design&#41;? to me the inside more looks like a book, not like
    a magazine, which is fine, but doesn&#39;t remind me on one of the two ids <IMG

  body: Sorry, I meant the US ID, and not the european ID or I-D. And the more I look
    at it, the more I think the US ID. The cover is using much the same device of
    the content listing on the right with rules under each item. Same goes for the
    use of white space and rules in the interior shot. Again, if memory serves, the
    two magazines have the same publisher, so perhaps we are seeing the beginning
    of a merging between the two, as ID is about industrial design, though it has
    often covered graphic design.

    rounded Gotham. Sorry. Maybe it has to do with the abundant use of Gotham in general.
    I bought it last year out of sheer gotta-have-it-kinda-love, but it seems to be
    everywhere I look: Home Depot, Banana Republic, Lowes, magazine after magazine,
    etc. etc. Enough already! I&#39;ve already abandoned it for Avenir Next, Houschka,

  body: i would lean towards agreeing with dylan...as i havent examined it nearly
    as much as i should to make wonderfully educated statements, my opinion is mostly
    on a quick pick up and browsing but it feels or felt somewhat goofy and awkward.
    again, as it was a while ago i looked at it, it just felt like it was in opposition
    to some of the layouts i saw &#40;the use of the rounded HTF Gotham&#41;. i like
    the table of contents...clean and easy to figure out. the first page of them at
    least. i remember some crazy arrows on the second page perhaps? not sure what
    they were for other than needless distraction maybe....standard gotham is wonderful
    and used in the right setting can evoke all sorts of moods and conjur up any number
    of wonderful signage pieces i&#39;ve seen, but in the wrong places it feels just
    that. wrong. again, i&#39;d have to give it a harder lookover but i&#39;m leaning
    towards not being extrememly wowed by the new redesign. it&#39;s clean, but clean
    like nakedly bashful? <BR> <BR>anyone seen How&#39;s redesign? there&#39;s a beast

  body: i most definitely cannot deny the fact this redesign is very nice. in the
    few times i&#39;ve picked up older issues of print &#40;including the one i borrowed
    from our little library today&#41; it&#39;s easy to see this is much more clean
    and readable. eye-friendly. BUT, putting the fact aside that this is a change
    and improvement on something that already existed, i&#39;m curious to know why,
    if this magazine made it&#39;s debut today, why we&#39;d like it&#39;s design.
    unfortunately, i&#39;m coming off as dense and uneducated which i regret to do,
    but i&#39;m more curious as to what designers think about good page layout and
    design. like what makes those things click in our heads while the pieces fall
    together. as i work with a magazine currently doing design and layout i feel i
    can never learn enough, and it was the one subject of design education that always
    seemed to elude me, sort of like long division in 3rd grade. being able to design
    in the short term with the long term always in mind, and it always left me feeling
    like i was missing something. <BR> <BR>so if anyone would like to explain in depth
    the reasons for the enjoyment of this redesign, i, and hopefully others, would
    find it very informative. comparing the old to the new, or just stating reasons
    as to why you like or dislike what is happening within those pages. <BR> <BR>cheers
    to always feeling like you know nothing but can learn everything! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    actually paid attention to in quite some time.  When recent past issues arrived,
    I&#39;d quickly flip through them and immediate make the decision that the text
    heavy articles made my brain hurt and I&#39;d set the magazine aside for possible
    read later.  The new design caught my attention.  I actually sat down and started
    reading it as soon as I ripped it out of it&#39;s plastic mailing bag.  It seems
    that pentagram has put some new life into what was becoming a stale publication
    for me. <BR> <BR>The other F&#43;W design publication, HOW, also got a going over
    by pentagram and I think the redesign is refreshing and gives the editors/art
    directors a lot more flexibility in presenting text and images.  I suppose, in
    the interest of &#34;full disclosure&#34; I should acknowledge that I am a member
    of HOW&#39;s Editorial Advisory Board - and it was interesting to be included

  body: Interestingly, I don&#39;t care too much for the new Print logo redesign.
    While the typeface warmly reflects handprinting reminiscent of early years in
    elementary school, it is overall sterile and plain. As some of you have touched
    on, I think the magazine is becoming uniformly &#34;sexless&#34; and &#34;unappealing&#34;
    like so many others trying to increase its readership through formal conservatism.
    Whatever happened to design based on &#34;personality&#34; and &#34;character&#34;?
    A typeface can convey, conjure, and evoke emotional content as well as communicate
    at the same time. <BR> <BR>I feel the use of H&amp;FJ&#39;s Gotham Rounded gets
    lost in the cover, amist the photography or illustration, thus becoming difficult
    to read from a browsing distance. Also, the visual weight, both due to spacing
    and density of the letters &#34;print&#34; are too weak in my opinion. I also
    find it interesting that the color is yellow since it&#39;s commonly known that
    it&#39;s the first color to become indistinguishable for a male color blind person.
    <BR> <BR>I must admit that the new design is an improvement. I just think it could
    go even further.
