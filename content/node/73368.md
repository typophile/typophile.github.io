  fonts used in the graphic below. I was hoping someone with a lot more expertise
  could offer some help. \r\n\r\nFor Sid Vicious, it looks almost like Machine with
  a few of the points altered. Can anyone confirm that?\r\n\r\nAnd for the Millenium
  Man text, I'm just lost all-around on this one. \r\n\r\nThe image itself, if it
  helps any is from a (c)2001 OOP VHS release from the Turner library. \r\n\r\nAnything
  you could advise is most definitely appreciated. Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a5kqpi_4319.jpg]"

    is, I even have this on my PC from a previous project. \r\n\r\nAnyway, cheers
    to you. Thanks."
