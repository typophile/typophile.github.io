body: "I'm looking for an online portfolio service to upload my work to. \r\n\r\nMy
  sister uses this site http://www.carbonmade.com/ but I'd like to know if there are
  other sites out there as well (preferably free or for a low fee).\r\n\r\nAn ideal
  site would allow me to upload high quality images (with little to no limit on file
  size or amount), support PDF, JPEG, GIF and PNG files, and have a section to list
  information about each project image. A place for contact information and resume
  uploading would be good too. \r\n\r\nAnything like that out there? \r\n\r\nIf you
  use the service, could you give me a review and remark if you like it or not. \r\n\r\nThanks."

    an ideal world, I would. But I'm not very adept at web developing and have to
    get something online ASAP so I can start hunting for a job. I figured an online
    portfolio service would meet my immediate needs to get something up and quickly.
    \r\n\r\nI've been interested in Behance, they have a nice site... I'll look into
    that definitely! "
