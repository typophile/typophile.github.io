  How can i auto align them centered when usign the generate glyphs action? I don't
  want to use anchors and the <strong><code>A+|acute=Aacute</code></strong> is not
  working as it's suposed to, and i don't understand what i'm doing wrong.\r\nAny
  help would be greatly apreciated\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nKiko"

    them automatically centered only as a first stage in the building process, and
    them pass to optical ajustments."

  body: "Have you tried just double clicking the empty slots (if you have both key
    letter and the diacritic mark)?\r\n\r\nWhen doing this the glyphs gets collected
    from a file called \"alias.dat\" where instructions are written which glyph should
    have which accent etc. This alias.dat can also be modified to make your font production
    even faster.\r\n\r\nBy default (when I double klick or use the \u201DCreate glyphs\u201D,
    or \u201DCreate glyphs if empty\u201D command) all my components are automatically
    centered.\r\n\r\nBtw, your command A+|acute=Aacute makes the component accent
    to placed to the left. If you just type A+acute=Aacute, everything is centered."

    now it works, i'm so stupid i was conviced that i was using the right command.\r\nVery
    simple! \r\nI will also try to edit the alias.dat as you mentioned and see what
    i get.\r\n\r\nThanks to all for helping\r\n\r\nSeeya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
