  was down again. Just wondering what is with the shut downs, if there is some way
  to excpect them, or anything i can do to help make them less frequent.\r\n\r\nNow
  i can't even remember what i was going to post :P"

  body: "hey j_polo9\r\n\r\nI had problems connecting for nearly 5 days. I read on
    a few blogs that it's because the forum is in Beta? I'd love to know if it's universal
    or just my browser?\r\n\r\nOn occasions I\u2019d get time outs and others a SQL
    error. next time i'll write the error message down...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPaul

  body: "As a newbie to this forum, and a lurker for the past few weeks, I've got
    to say I'm surprised at how often the Typophile site is down.\r\n\r\nAs well as
    the \"Warning: mysql_connect(): ...\" message, I sometimes receive \"Access is
    Denied\" messages when I click a topic from the RSS feed.\r\n\r\nIf the fora do
    indeed use a beta product, it still needs work. It is very unreliable.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a shame; I really enjoy reading the posts and am learning a lot about typography,
    but I won't stay around if the site keeps going off-line this often.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFrank."

  body: Nah, Typophile has been out of Beta since this spring. The problems were provider-side.
    Typophile freed up a lot of space to avoid going down every time. I'll ask Christian
    to chime in and give some more details.

  body: Sorry for the recent outages, folks. We were scraping the top of our allocated
    disk space, causing mysql to run out of room. We have since asked Media Temple
    to donate more space (they're the ones that pay our hosting bills--thanks, guys),
    which they have graciously done. So we should have room in our databases for many
    more heated, passionate discussions.
