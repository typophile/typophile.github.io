body: ' this follows up Soren&#39;s comments in the Van thread <BR> <BR>Ricardo -
  In lieu of specific comments about the Van family &#40;besides I like it/it&#39;s
  a winner&#41; I&#39;d like to talk about the green. I enjoy it.  <BR> <BR> <BR>As
  pure conjecture, I would say that it&#39;s part of Ricardo&#39;s overall branding
  scheme. The green is light and pleasant. Branding is a interesting issue that would
  be fun to explore.  <BR> <BR>I think that this forum is certainly a nice example
  of branding at work. I don&#39;t know about you but the colors on my screen are
  orange and gray. Not distracting. Branding. <BR> <BR>However, if the colors were
  Hunter Green and Bright Brown, then it&#39;d be distracting. <BR> <BR>BTW, see the
  power or the pitfall of green at www.garagefonts.com. <BR> <BR>Also, the obligatory
  poster to promote a font is still in wide use, but I think House and a few others
  have taken font promotion and value-added packages to another level. <BR> <BR>Because
  fonts are virtually worthless in the eyes of most laypeople, marketing, promotion
  and branding becomes even more important to gain and retain customers. <BR> <BR>I
  know there&#39;s a historical perspective here. Perhaps somebody can enlighten us
  about some of the pioneers of font promotion, what they did, and how they did it.
  In the digital age, what are some good and bad examples of font promotion that helped
  or hurt a certain typeface, foundry or designer. <BR> <BR>bj '

    I wasn&#39;t suggesting that color = branding. <BR> <BR>But there is so much more
    to branding than type and color. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
