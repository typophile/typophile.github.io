  body: "Good eyes Patricia, DeVinne and that sample are remotely related - but that
    \"a\" is decidedly French. Richard, what you want is not yet digitized, AFAIK
    - it looks to be Deberny's #17 from around a century ago. They also had a short-extender
    version called #16, and a custom -and to me very attractive- long-extender one
    called #18. After Deberny and Peignot merged, all that understated brilliance
    was overpowered by the fashion for gaudy display fonts.\r\n\r\nThe least inaccessible
    version of this design was one\r\nmade by Linotype, and called #16 - here's a
    rough scan:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lino16_3636.gif]\r\n\r\nThat
    italic has elements of genius.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
