  museum that used Nobel as its typeface, what type would you choose (one family)
  to use in conjunction with Nobel?

    Scala</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11483.0.0">FF
    Nexus</a> (which is basically the OT version of Scala) are great faces for a contemporary
    museum. They should also play well with Nobel.

    I don't think it pair that well with Nobel either. Nobel is very clean and strict.
    Perpetua on the other hand has a lot of character. I would say it might take over?!"

  body: Points taken. I'm focusing on the small x-height, and, I think, looking for
    something with a taste of Nobel's rational geometry.

  body: "I dunno. There aren't many good serifs with a rational geometry. Closest
    I can think of is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=LH.76.0.0\">Melior</a>,
    but that may very well appear too dated for the museum, and it's got a large x-height.\r\n\r\nProbably
    best not to worry so much about categorical compatibility. Just put Nobel side-by-side
    with samples of versatile serifs that fit the museum well and the sorts of texts
    you'll be setting."
