  logo. This is the first time I have done this, with a real company (always been
  at school before). And I came up with a few ideas, I liked 2 which I think work
  well (my opinion I guess), and one that my boss did (he's not very design savvy
  though). And they liked his. I'd like to know what you guys think. I feel that mine
  wasn't took bad. I need them in only a few hours as that was the time that I was
  given.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nPS - He's logo is bad quality because he sent it to
  me like that. And the ones I liked most out of mine were the 2nd and 4th.\r\n"

  body: "Okay, I like the first one because in some way it reminds me of a truck or
    something in motion which connects with the idea of trans-PORTABLE things. Then
    I like the last one because the star connotes 'new beginnings' or 'new possibilities\".\r\n\r\nBut
    for the first one to work I think you need more trails to show motion. I'll include
    a picture of a successful logo that demonstrates a dynamic 'in motion' feeling.
    Or perhaps you can draw a building in the back of a truck bed in motion?\r\n\r\nFor
    the last one you need to move \"portable building\" down just a pinch- It seems
    like its colliding with NOVA. Perhaps even shrink the font size and loosen the
    letter spacing- that ones up to you. Also the star in the center of NOVA needs
    work. Try to make the shape seem more star like. Its a little too fat for me.
    :)\r\n\r\nThe two in the middle are not doing anything for me. But the outlying
    illustrations are the most promising. You need a logo with visual pun and whimsey.
    These are the most memorable.... so try the truck with a building in the back
    or some other pun you can come up with.\r\n\r\nHope I'm helping you,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_praxair_6349.gif]\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see the logo looks like its in motion. You see the trails...that's what
    I mean. Of course put your own spin on it. \r\n\r\n;O)"

  body: "Thanks Mikey,\r\nAppriciate the help. The job already went through, but I'll
    definity have a think about it, fix it with some of the things you said, so next
    time I'll be better prepaid and have a better idea, cheers.\r\nAnd the swirl is
    a visual pun, although I should have worked on it more, and would have given more
    time. Its a snail shell, which is a portable building, in a sense. \r\nWhat gets
    my goat is that the client went for something which in my opinion doesnt say much,
    isnt dynamic, and I've seen heaps of logos like that and I just think its cheap.
    \r\nBut we all have our opinions. \r\nThanks for the help. Can anyone give me
    an idea of where I should look, such as a site or a book, that could help me with
    logos. Also an idea of what I should be doing or asking with clients, so I get
    a clearer idea of what they want. Again, a book or website would be great, if
    possible.\r\n\r\nThanks again micky, and thanks to everyone else..."

  body: "Your boss' logo is going to be difficult to make work at all sizes due to
    the small size of portable buildings, leaving aside the spacing at each side of
    the oval and the kerning of NOVA. \r\nOf yours \r\n1. gives too much importance
    to portable buildings and the word NOVA might look better if it centred on the
    strapline rather than the entire graphic\r\n2. the snail shell is a good metaphor
    for portable homes but it does also look like a downward spiral\r\n3. and 4. are
    quite corporate (not necessarily a bad thing though) 4 reminds me of HSBC's logo\r\nI
    would look at 1 and 2 to develop further.\r\nTim\r\n{edit I cross posted with
    you}"

  body: "I'd like to chime in and say that I agree with timd - I like the snail shell
    metaphor (but it does bring with it negative connotations, i.e. slowness, moving
    at a <em>snail's</em> pace - although personally I didn't take the 'downward spiral'
    from it). However it was the one that stuck out for me as being the logo I noticed
    first. I think it would benefit from being more organic, rather than being an
    Illustrator fixed-width spiral path.\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "The trouble is if you present a client with several ideas they will without
    fail choose the weakest \u2013 Sod's Law. Just grin and bear it, you will face
    the same situation on many occasions.\r\nReading a client's mind is a matter of
    getting to know them, find out if they have a sense of design or whether they
    are looking to you to help them through the process, in which case give them confidence
    that you know what you are doing. If the company already exists ask them why they
    are changing their logo (try not to knock it as the client's eldest probably did
    it for them) and what elements \u2013 colour, typeface, shape\u2013 they want
    to keep. I often look to see what competitor's logos are like to avoid look-a-likes.
    When presenting a logo try and show the logo in use in stationery/vehicle livery.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581804369/qid=1146833656/sr=1-9/ref=sr_1_9/002-8341577-4047237?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "The one with a swirl could be used for anybody. Its not saying anything about
    portable structures or even the company. And the accompanying font is too weak
    to survive faxing and web work. A bolder weight maybe. Also the rounded points
    at the end make it look to heavy for me.\r\nAs for the one that looks like red
    blocks\u2026 the idea behind it is good but you really need to make it look more
    like building blocks or units... so people can get the pun.\r\n\r\nTake Care,\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\nPS...
    Is that Myriad you are using? Looks great!!! I hope your client loves your work!"

  body: "I hope I don't sound rude, coz i aont tryin to be, but, the swirl is a generic
    shape, and it is saying something about the company, that its portable. The end
    is to the side on perpose. BUt I see what your saying, it isn't very strong, given
    the time I would have worked on it. And I don't get how you knew it was a pun
    and then said it make it more clear. And finally the font, I know its bad, but
    no time was given for me to find a free, san serif font, that doesnt have faults,
    like most free san serif fonts have. All the fonts I have were given to me when
    I installled windows, and aboout a few hundred which are more decrotive fonts
    than anything else.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks"

  body: "3dsnail> \r\n\r\nI don't think your are being rude. So your okay.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the second logo with the swirl... When I first saw it I immediately thought \"Illustrator
    spring\". I did not even think of a snail until you said that it was but I was
    objecting to was its vagueness. After all I did not get it. If the shape was more
    shell like I would liked it very much. Funny though someone said downward spiral-
    I would have never though that. ;-)\r\n\r\nFor the third logo. I had to think
    about that one, then I caught on that those were supposed to be blocks. So if
    you added a third dimension and changed the type... It would be like GREAT! \r\n\r\nIn
    other words, the metaphors in both of those logos were too weak for me to grasp
    instantly. Nothing against you or anything like that. In fact if all of the logos
    were polished and perfected then you would really have some excellent stuff there.\r\n\r\nAs
    far not having fonts I understand. Microsoft has the most miserable selection
    of type included with its operating system. But I do like the font you chose for
    the first one and the last one.... that is a great font.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyhow take
    care,\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\nPS... I had a design I was playing with maybe you can
    give me an opinion... search for \"Afro Clinic card\" and tell me what you think...
    if you want of course."

  body: "Hey Mikey,\r\nCheers for the help. You are spot on I think when you say that
    it was weak. I dont disagree, just wish I had more time, oh well. Thanks for the
    website, fontfont. Its pretty good. Seen a few font sites, but they are usually
    limited and have decrotive fonts, which aren't my favorite. Also, I thought you
    was being sarcastic with the myraid font. My teacher would tell anyone off if
    we used mircosoft fonts, and I thought you was doing the same. My bad, sorry.
    Andi'll do a search as soon as I've sent this.\r\n\r\nCheers, and thanks again.\r\n>ER\r\n\r\nPS
    - Anyone know of a good font search program, so i can preview my fonts, like font
    xplorer, thats for free?"

  body: I like your first one because in my opinion is the one that best conveys dynamism/movement.
    Now, Tim's sugestions are crucial, most of the times it's not (only) a matter
    of skills but it's about the relationship you create with the client and the questions
    you ask in order to find out what's in his mind (if anything at all). Having said
    that, there are many ways you can represent movement... the blurring of the elements
    is probably the most obvious but you could also try to slice an image into pieces
    or the repetition of some elements (see Armin Hofmann)...well, good luck with
    the project, I just gave up a job (I'm still digesting the event) because of an
    infuriating client, don't we all hate them?
