  body: "Couldn't find any font that have /G with such crossbar. Actually, the only
    legal font I could name for the Gvir(a)bi logo is [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/erbar|Erbar]]
    but that's not it. Could be easy to reconstruct though, just needs to recreate
    /G with /O.\r\n The apparent poorly kerning may also indicate it could be a geometric
    sans freebie. You could find many of them through the [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501|Basic
    > Sans-serif]] section at DaFont. "
