body: I'm designing a series of handouts for a new church with a multi-generational
  congregation. The serif "Proforma" has been chosen for the basic body info. What
  sans would you suggest to go with Proforma? Thanks.

  body: "Hi Indra,\r\nThanks for the suggestion. I tried Productus, but the weights
    didn't match visually with Proforma-Productus' book was darker than proforma's,
    Productus didn't have a light, that kind of thing. I think I'm going to run with
    Amplitude."
