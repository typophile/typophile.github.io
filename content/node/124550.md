    is a match to neither.\r\n\r\nThe only typeface I recognize is Jukebox Fonts/Jason
    Walcott\u2019s Corner Store for the script...."

  body: Caleb Owen Everitt, half of L A N D is well know for his custom letterings.
    Most of his works are hand-done or heavily customization of existing fonts so
    probably, another of his creations.

  body: Not perfect but a good alternative/base font for "DEUS EX MACHINA" with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mpressinteractive/mpi-republic-gothic|Republic
    Gothic]]. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-magnesium|Magnesium]] is
    interesting for "CAMPERDOWN SYDNEY NSW".

  body: "Mote that _DEUS EX MACHINA_ has reverse/inverse contrast, a.k.a. vertical
    stress. Republic Gothic, suggested by Ryuk, has this feature. Also see Moniak
