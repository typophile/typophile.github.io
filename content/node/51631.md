  body: "Well.. climb the hill towards Hangman's Ridge, avoiding any mountain lions.
    When you reach an old barn, go around back and ask for Charlie. Tell Charlie the
    dancing stones are restless. He will give you his van. Take Charlies van down
    the old mine road, but do not wake the straw man. Turn left on Comstock. When
    you feel the blood in your veins run cold get out of the van. Up the ridge there
    is a book outlining all the details of font design but it guarded by a Spectral
    Wolf.\r\n\r\nThe Spectral Wolf fears only fire.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
