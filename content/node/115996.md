body: "I need an exact match for this sans serif. ITC Officina Sans is very close.
  There are significant differences. The G is a different shape. The S in the sample
  has a slightly tapered stroke. The verticals on the A seem to curve ever so slightly,
  though this one could be due to a tracing...\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated
  by my client and myself.\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo-01_6004.JPG]"
