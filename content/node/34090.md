body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the ideal typeface to put my name - Benjamin Knight
  - in. I started by looking at the usual suspects... Helvetica and Univers and Futura
  etc. Heldustry wasn't bad. But they just don't look right. It might be that the
  particular combination of letters in my name just doesn't look good. Any help is
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nIt'll be on letterheads and business cards etc etc. But
  also on - interlaced - tv screens... so best not to go thinner than medium weight,
  lest it disappear between pixels. Sans serif is probably better, but I could be
  talked round. I want something that looks reasonably slick and masculine; sort of
  the Michael Mann of typefaces.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nBenjamin."

  body: With an upper K and lower j and i's, I'd think that italics might suit you?
    Not a script, certainly, but I am sure there is one that is still 'manly' and
    solid enough to work?

  body: "Thanks Ayse!\r\nBTW Benjamin, more than Trajan what I'm really suggesting
    is that \"KN\" metaligature*. If you like it, when you arrive at what font you'd
    like to use, I could easily make a glyph like that in that font (and being a type
    designer I would make it balanced and polished, which is harder than it might
    seem, except for the most modular of fonts). Cost: US$50.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/14040\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Nice work, Hrant. That would add a nice mnemonic device to the name. (In fact,
    you could probably do something similar to the word, <em>mnemonic </em>.)

  body: "The word MNEMONIC allows the quite satisfactory ligature og NE. Hrant's KN
    ligature is not bad at all. I wonder whether Benjamin Knight likes it.\r\nLigatures
    and 'nested' letters were used by Roman and Romanesque lettercutters to save space.
    Now we reinvent them and use them as design features. A clever student of mine,
    Massimiliano Frangi, found several in the Milan Cemetry. Here is one (EM, with
    a flipped E) from a relief Latin inscription that seems quite os\xE9 and probably
    dates back to the 1930s. How do you put images into this discussion? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone who has posted; very cool. The idea
    that i, j and K suggest something italic is exactly the kind of design nous I
    was looking for. But would you advise the same if I went all uppercase?\r\n\r\nOf
    the fonts suggested I like Sanuk the most. Maple is too cartoony for me. Malaga
    is nice too. Not sure it's been cracked yet though.\r\n\r\nThe whole metaligature
    discussion is really interesting, not sure if it works for this application though;
    I just saw a K at first and thought you'd missed out the N. Of course - like any
    illusion - once you've seen it you can't go back, but the fact that it took me
    a few seconds means it's probably not right for the tv screen instance I mention
    in my original post... it'll only be up there for a limited time.\r\n\r\nBut I
    was beginning to think about playing with the letters in some way... adapting
    them... beginning to think that there might not be a pure 'font solution'.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for all your input. I'll keep working on it.\r\n\r\nBenjamin."
