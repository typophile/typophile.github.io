    based on gender. I think inexperienced designers in general will choose less appropriate
    type/ways of designing , based on style or 'preference.' It just so happen when
    a male* does it, it just looks mediocre/inappropriate and when a woman*  does
    it, it looks froofy/inappropriate. \r\n\r\n*inexperienced\r\n\r\nPeace"

  body: Heh, this reminds me of <em>American Psycho,</em> where all the rich VPs are
    having a dick-waving contest with their business cards, going on about the cardstock
    and foil and so on. In the film, the card that finally owns everyone and sends
    our madman into a jealous rage is a plain white card set in Copperplate.
