  ]]I decided  to create the 2 numerals, oldstyle figures and lining figures.\r\nI
  place here a simple example of both them in ligth and extra bold.\r\nI need some
  feedback on these. Do you feel that the numerals belong to the typeface? I mean,
  do they fit in the overall letters? Do the oldstyle figures work fine with the text?\r\nThank
  you for the feedback!\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n"

  body: 6 and 9 are a bit squarer than I would expect. Mostly it's that they are flat
    on the side.
