  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m not a designer, as you&rsquo;ll see.  I&rsquo;m opening a pet grooming salon and spa. (my second - sold my other one and moved.)  It is called Unleashed Pet Salon.  I designed the attached logo but now I don&rsquo;t like it.  It&rsquo;s simply too busy, doesn&rsquo;t work well small&hellip;  I don&rsquo;t know.  I would really appreciate any help, suggestions, modifications, etc.</p>
<p>I want the &lsquo;feel&rsquo; to be modern, upscale but still pet friendly.  Not cutesy stuff. Simple.  I really need some help here.  I just can&rsquo;t get it.  I feel like I need to redo the entire thing.  What really made me start looking at it again was getting ready to order window decals&hellip;they&rsquo;re white and it just doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<p>Thoughts?  Please!  Thank you in advance!!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m truly not saying this to be bitchy, but it needs to be said: hire a professional. There&rsquo;s just too much wrong here to even begin breaking it down.</p>
<p>If your target market is affluent clientèle, having a professional logo is crucial to your success. The affluent are impressed by elegance and class and distrustful of anything less.</p>
<p>You want your brand to be something they brag about to their friends, right? You want your cards to be on refrigerators, right? Then, it&rsquo;s all about appearances. Your logo has to get their attention and fit into their world. What you have (so far) says appearances don&rsquo;t matter. You NEED them to trust your aesthetic to even try you out - so your logo needs to be as gorgeous as (insert a fabulous dog here).</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t do your own plastic surgery, right? You&rsquo;d hire a pro, because it&rsquo;s your appearance - your very identity, and you have to live with it forever. Your logo is the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds harsh, it&rsquo;s just meant to be honest.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Phew.  No, I know that&rsquo;s all true.  Thanks though for not being mean about it.  I needed the little kick!  I do appreciate it.  I&rsquo;d all ready learned from viewing this site that there is a LOT more that goes into a logo than I had any idea.  As an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; I would strongly suggest to any logo designer they create something (website, brochure, etc) that shows the entire process of designing a logo.  I saw it somewhere on this site.  Maybe that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s all ready a norm&hellip;  It&rsquo;s like me and grooming dogs - people think it is easy and should only take an hour to bathe and groom their dogs&hellip;little do they know the process. Until I show it too them.  And, I should have taken the same advice I give dog people - there are professionals that do this for a REASON!!!</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>I will look for a professional.  Anyone else interested in working on this??</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>ebreiner,</p>
<p>I understand what you are trying to say with the comment &ldquo;create something (website, brochure, etc) that shows the entire process of designing a logo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing is, that &ldquo;something&rdquo; includes all the knowledge earned in a bachelors degree or the equivalent in self-study and apprenticeships, a ton of obsessive thinking on symbolism, focus groups and/or random opinions of strangers AND trained eyes, a couple grand worth of software and the years it takes to earn the skills to use it all properly, and a commitment to learn the details of each new business and THEN the ability to boil a whole company down into something about an eight of the size of a business card.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to explain to people that logo design is infinitely more complex than the final result, and that&rsquo;s rather the point. Again, it&rsquo;s like plastic surgery. The world sees the beautiful face, but only the surgeon truly knows the science that makes it beautiful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You started the whole thing with the wrong sentence: I&rsquo;m not a designer. Replies reflect that. Even though I think we may come to some sort of a logo for you. First of all you should post smaller images.</p>
<p>First of all I would make a nice dog stylisation and not just a side outline. A semi front stylisation would probably work much better.</p>
<p>But before that you should think what&rsquo;s more valuable to you: your time spent on this logo (based on your lack of knowledge it would be at least a month of full days of work) or a designer that will produce a nice contemporary logo for you. Maybe in the same time but may still be much cheaper. In the end you&rsquo;ll also need collateral stuff that a designer will be able to produce much faster and better aligned with your logo than you. I guess.</p>
