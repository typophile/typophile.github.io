  it.\r\n\r\nIs there a correct position to slash and backslash?\r\nI'm seeing some
  typefaces with them long enough until descenders, some just from baseline, and some
  in beetween. \r\n\r\nDepend on function, history, or just taste?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAlfonso"

  body: Slashes should be consistent with parentheses and brackets. The general idea
    with all of these is that they are vertically centered on the main mass of the
    text. Prescriptive text faces have them span ascender to descender, centered on
    the lowercase body, and usually supply an Opentype feature that shifts them upward
    for all caps. The "in between" school is accounting for the fact that descending
    letters are fewer and occur less frequently (in English and most other languages)
    than ascending letters, and so regards the bulk of the text on average to be higher.
    Stopping at the baseline tends to be the mark of a display face that expects to
    be used in all caps most often. Even then, some protrusion is called for. The
    slash functions as a divider, and so should not be lost among letters. You don't
    want it mistaken for an I or l in an italic sans. Same, more emphatically, goes
    for the vertical bar.

  body: "The backslash is a character that was included in the ASCII character set
    because it was thought that people might be able to use it to compose AND and
    OR operators as /\\ and \\/. Despite that, the original backslash, on the Model
    33 Teletype, whether ASR, KSR, or RO, was a short slash at a 45 degree angle.\r\n\r\nBasically,
    it's a weird character that nobody uses, which has no business occupying prime
    real estate in the 128-character subset of UNICODE. But it's too late to change
    things now.\r\n\r\nAs the previous reply noted, the solidus should go slightly
    above cap height and slightly below the baseline by an equal amount. This may
    vary if you are using old-style numerals. There would also be the issue with metal
    type that if lower-case ascenders did not extend above cap height, there would
    be no way (without kerning which would mandate leading) to so extend the solidus
    on the type body.\r\n\r\nThis is still relevant in the digital era how? For accurate
    recreations of typefaces which existed in the era of hot metal."
