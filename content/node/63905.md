  \ It's a software company, and they've had this logo for ten years.  I realize there
  is some equity built into this brand by now, so I don't think I want to make a drastic
  change, but I do want to evolve it a little:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-ni_4742.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  think I may need to adjust the typeface.  I've personally heard a few reactions
  from people when encountering our brand along the lines of \"hey - is that the Star
  Trek font?\"\r\n\r\nIt's actually Galaxy, which is not the Star Trek font, but definitely
  has a distinct sci-fi feel to it.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for font suggestions.  Something
  that keeps some of the characteristics of Galaxy, but moves away from sci-fi and
  more towards a corporate feel.  For example, the lowercase t in [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Aller|Aller]]
  is similar to the t in Galaxy.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It actually <em>is</em> kind of a Star Trek font. The posters/cover of the
    Star Trek movies throughout the '80s used a font that is strinkingly similar.
    [[http://images.themoviedb.org/posters/5373/star_trek3.jpg|Look at this.]] Anyway,
    I don't think you can blame people for making the connection.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    I would be interested to see an updating of this with Aller or some other corporate
    face like Officina. Another interesting direction might be something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango-gothic/|Sh\xE0ng\xF3]].
    It doesn't have a lowercase, but those serifs are interesting. Galaxy has serifs
    but it also has the sci-fi baggage, so if you want to make a less drastic change
    of face I would try out something with distinct serifs. "
