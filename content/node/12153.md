  (SOTA)\r\n\r\nThe <strong>Society of Typographic Aficionados</strong> (SOTA) is
  an international not-for-profit organization dedicated to the promotion, study,
  and support of type, its history and development, its use in the world of print
  and digital imagery, its designers, and its admirers.\r\n\r\nSOTA exists for the
  affordable education of its members and participants; to further the development
  of type, typographical information and typography; and to appreciate on multiple
  levels the attributes of type, typography, design, the book arts, and calligraphy.
  Furthermore, SOTA is committed to sponsoring relevant topics in pursuit of these
  goals. SOTA pursues these goals through an annual conference, [[TypeCon]], held
  in a different host city each year.\r\n\r\nSOTA was formed in 1998 by typophile
  [[Bob Colby]], with the mission to increase public awareness and appreciation of
  the art and history of typography and its function in creating beautiful and successful
  communications. In keeping with these goals, SOTA is defined as a cultural (rather
  than a business) organization.\r\n\r\n<strong>Executive Officers</strong> (2014)\r\nChristopher
