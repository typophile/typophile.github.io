  body: For what it&#39;s worth, the Arena masthead face is similar in a lot of ways
    to an emboldened <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/insignia/insignia/testdrive.html?s=ARENA&amp;p=72">Insignia</a>
    mixed with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-typeface-6-and-7/six/testdrive.html?s=ARENA&amp;p=72">Typeface
    Six</a>, both by Brody as well.
