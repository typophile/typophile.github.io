  body: "VAG Rounded Black (maybe with some extra fatness thrown in for good measure).
    There are other similar fonts as well.\r\n\r\n And no, there are no consistent
    terms. You'll sometimes see 'rounded' (usually to describe the strokes' ends),
    fat (generally descriptive), etc. etc."

  body: I  very much doubt that the counters on the A's are really closed. They're
    not on the R or the O. I also think that much of the 'blackness" is an artifact
    from the very low resolution copy of a half-toned image.
