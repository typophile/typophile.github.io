An author should be able to select a section of text in a word processor and choose from menu items like Tense, Suspenseful, Angry, or Serene and have that supported by things like amount of kerning, serifs, even-ness of character spacing, line spacing, italicization, line weight, and character shape. The author should only have to worry about mood, not how the mood is achieved. <BR> <BR></div>

The muffin shop located in the subway continuously vented the air from its ovens into the underground mall. But that was not sufficiently motivating, because once people had been in the mall for 15 seconds, they would tune out the marvelous aroma as &#34;background&#34;. So the muffin shop would vent periodically, to keep potential customers aware. <BR> <BR>But continuous text is surely not like that, the premise being that typographic nuance is subconscious, yet still meaningful.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t get your point. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a difference between display and text fonts. Anybody who can&#39;t see that has a black hole where his theory should be. Theory is no replacement for practical experience, but only theory can help forge new ground, the prerequisite of cultural progress &#40;as opposed to merely paying the bills&#41;. <BR> <BR>This difference between text and display affects the nature of expressiveness. What I mean for example is that Massin&#39;s &#34;concrete typography&#34; stuff -which to me has always seemed deathly boring, because it&#39;s so obvious- is only partially related to expressiveness in text design, which has to be supremely subtle to work right. <BR> <BR>For a long time I&#39;d been looking for a text counterpart to the Massin stuff, and Avital Ronell&#39;s efforts &#40;like &#34;The Telephone Book&#34;&#41; were interesting, but still largely in the realm of display. I ended up finding &#40;thanks to a Typo-L member&#41; one single instance -but a superb one- of what I was looking for, in the unlikeliest of places: a trashy fantasy novel! It&#39;s called &#34;The Interior Life&#34;, and in it the author, Katherine Blake &#40;an alias&#41;, who also directed the typography, uses different fonts &#40;all texty&#41; to express the mundane versus exciting components of a contemporary housewife&#39;s medieval romantic adventures. It&#39;s a 300-page novel with a lot of interweaving of realities so to speak, so it must have been a lot of work to set in such an elaborate system, and there can&#39;t even be any proof that it actually works! But just the fact that somebody &#40;who isn&#39;t even a professional designer&#41; has done it makes me happy, and really, if you don&#39;t believe it can work, you can&#39;t believe making new text fonts is worth the effort. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In my edition of <i>Babel Tower</i>, the main story is set in Bembo; there are a lot of narrative threads, but one involves the principal character becoming involved in the legal defence of a novel charged with obscenity. Large sections of the novel in question are interwoven into the narrative, and are set in Joanna. The contrast works very well in the well-printed hard cover edition: both types are good text faces, and Joanna nicely captures the modernity of the novel within the novel. It works less well in the paperback edition, in which the text is too small and too badly printed for the difference between the types to be obvious to the average reader.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have no problem with mixing typefaces to elucidate stories within stories, parallel stuff, and whatnot. As far as I am concerned this can be done as structural typography, which need not have anything to do with overtly expressive typography.  <BR> <BR>But the kind of &#34;mood-supporting&#34; typography which I understand to be the original basis of this thread strikes me as akin to a dramatic reading, complete with theatrical effects. In general, I don&#39;t care for it myself. <BR> <BR>To continue the metaphor, selecting a typeface for a book &#40;here I&#39;m thinking mostly of a &#34;reading&#34; book -- as opposed to reference, or how-to, or coffee-table&#41; is not unlike casting a voice actor for a book-on-tape. To a certain extent, casting just the right voice may enhance the listener&#39;s experience of the text. And, certainly, casting a poor voice actor will get in the way of listening. But beyond a basic level of competence, it probably makes a small and subtle, if any, difference. <BR> <BR>But there will be no point to having James Earl Jones read these certain passages while Jeremy Irons breaks in to read those others. Unless, like I said, you&#39;re casting a dramatic reading -- in which case you have a different animal, and most likely not what the author had in mind. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I realize I&#39;m resurrecting this thread from the bottom, but I&#39;ve been away, so forgive my lateness with this comment. <BR> <BR>Have any of you read <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0375703764/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-4692538-5006533#reader-link">House of Leaves</a></i> by Mark Danielewski? It&#39;s an example book design &#40;its interior&#41; that becomes actively and even inextricably woven into the narrative. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0375703764/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-4692538-5006533#reader-page">Here&#39;s</a> a good example of a few of the more conservative type styles in action. You have the narrator in Courier and the text of a manuscript he&#39;s reconstructing in one serif, and the editor in another &#40;I don&#39;t have it with me to venture a guess&#41;. Then, whenever the word &#39;house&#39; appears, it&#39;s in blue &#40;or grey, depending on the edition&#41;. You can also see the labrynthian footnotes coming into play. There are also sections that have red strikethrough to indicated changes made by the manuscript</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So why wouldn&#39;t Snooky&#39;s idea work? And why is the idea <BR>being rubbished from the outset? Just because it hasn&#39;t  <BR>been done effectively or properly yet, is no reason to  <BR>assume that it won&#39;t. I reckon the guy is on to an excellent <BR>idea.

		<div class="commentbody">There are a few reasons &#40;from my understanding&#41; that Snookie&#39;s idea wouldn&#39;t work. First, the effect would be so subtle and so out of place &#40;unexpected&#41; in a novel full of running text, that all it would likely do is register as an odd visual aberration that makes reading more difficult or confusing, rather than more &#39;experiential&#39;. <BR> <BR>Without tapping into a certain degree of conscious comprehension &#40;and overt design manipulation&#41;, the effect would be uncontrollable. The landscape of the page in a novel &#40;to me&#41; is too susceptible/ sensitive to visual changes for the effect to work on a subtle text level. How is the reader going to pick up the purpose the individual contrasts spread over an entire novel? The interrelationship &#40;gestalt, I suppose&#41; would be very difficult to maintain, if not impossible, particularly if they need to change the subtle effects regularly to maintain their effect, as </div>
