    Being careful not to complain about free software, but saying something is coming
    soon for 2 years, leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. Don't imply something
    is close to being done, if it is not.\r\n\r\nProxima Software's <a href=\"http://www.proximasoftware.com/fontexpert/index.html\">FontExpert</a>
    is excellent for PC. There's a free 30 day trial too."

    software and was so disappointed when Adobe dropped Mac support.\r\n\r\nBut I
    think Linotype has topped it.\r\n\r\nIn the interim I tried Suitcase and Font
    Agent Pro and experienced way too many difficulties.\r\n\r\nThanks Linotype!\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "Bitsteam Font Navigator for the PC is great.  It will build a catalog of
    all fonts on your drive (ONCE, not every time it opens) and then present you with
    four, logical panes: Uninstalled, Installed, Groups and a preview pane.  From
    there it's all drag & drop.  It handles truetype, Type 1 and Opentype.\r\n\r\nNow
    here's the trick... you get it for free with CorelDraw.  If you want to TRY it,
    you can download the CorelDraw 12 thirty day tryout from Corel's website, and
    by carefully selecting features install ONLY Font Navigator. Unlike CorelDraw,
    Font navigator does not disable itself after 30 days, so it's up to you to remove
    it when you're done trying it out."

    I had to reinstall), and I quite liked it, but I didn't install it yet again.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I did miss: If I mark several fonts in the list, I'd like to see a preview of
    each one simultaneously. Is this possble with Font Navigator? I couldn't find
    it then..."

  body: "Unfortunately, Bitstream FN does not allow you to preview multiple fonts.
    \ This is a REALLY desireable feature, too, because it makes it easier to compare
    fonts, and to find specific typefaces.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it's the #1 reason I've
    yet to find any font navigator I can call perfect.  My ideal font navigator would:\r\n\r\n1)
    Build a database of all fonts (installed & uninstalled) on a given system, so
    it doesn't have to \"read\" the font files each time it's run. Of course, from
    time-to-time you'd have to manually update it.\r\n2) Allow you to show as many,
    or few fonts on screen at a time, by file name, font name, or group, etc.\r\n3)
    Allow you to set the display text and size to anything you want.\r\n4) Display
    the full file location, no matter how long the directory nest.\r\n\r\n#1) is the
    most important because when you have large libraries of fonts, you want to be
    able to get access quickly.\r\n\r\nBitstream FN does 1) fairly well, parts of
    3) & 4) and 2) not at all.  I used to like HP's Fontsmart (discontinued), but
    it wasn't perfect either."

  body: "Hmm, the best way to manage fonts without spending a dime is with AMP Font
    Viewer. I have used the old font manager from Adobe to others and nothing tops
    this program to me. The best feature I like is the install temporary fonts. I
    can load and unload a font on a need to use basis without loading up 2000 fonts
    slowing down my PhotoShop. This is a Windows only program though.\r\n\r\nWell
