body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone ever bump into this case. I am creating
  a font for a client. When I compose the font in illustrator CS5 I have no problem
  with spacing and kernings. But when my client use it in her illustrator all the
  kernings are gone. I ask her to send me her file to look after the problem. But
  the strangest thing happen when I open her file. To be simple the red line is my
  client composition and the blue one is mine. The font is exactly the same. The settings
  of the font panel are the same. Even when I am trying to use the Eyedropper the
  setting doesn't change. No kernings on my client composition. Anyone ever had this
  problem ? Is it a way to tell illustrator to use disable the kernings just for one
  line of text ? Any help would be much appreciate :-)\r\n\r\n"

    set to the same setting?\r\n- Is she using optical kerning or the like?\r\n- Are
    you using an OTF font/typeface while she is using a TTF one?\r\n- Are your illustrator
    versions the same or are you saving with backward compatability for the client?\r\n\r\nI've
    never faced such an issue. Very curious to understand whats happening. Do you
    use the same font manager?\r\n"

    into the Kern feature in your OpenType panel, several times, to break up the list
    of kerns into shorter segments."

    you switch to another font, does the problem go away and both lines look the same?\r\n\r\nIf
    you switch back to the original from that other font, does the problem come back?
    (Don't undo, go select the problematic font again.)"

  body: I seem to recall somewhere you can check a box to turn on manual kerning which
    in effect turns kerning off.

  body: "Which version of Illustrator is your client using? I remember Adobe apps
    not invoking the kerning if there is no other feature present in the font. (I
    think this was true for CS2 apps, maybe even CS3.)\r\n\r\nA solution for the problem
    would be the creation of a \u2018bogus\u2019 liga feature, something like:\r\n<code>\r\nliga
    {\r\n    sub hyphen by hyphen;\r\n} liga;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n(don\u2019t forget
    the tab in front of the \u2018sub\u2019 \u2013 Typophile\u2019s code formatting
    does not seem to get any better)\r\n\r\nHTH,\r\nFrank\r\n"

    of the caps. Bu I didn't check if the kern was correctly copied\u2026 And they
    aren't. So I guess I just need to find a easy to copy the kern features to components
    :-)"

  body: The best solution in a case like this is to use class kerning. Create a kerning
    class for each cap that kerns, and add the lowercase equivalent to each class.
    Doing it this way insures that you'll get kerning in caps-to-lowercase combinations
    as well.
