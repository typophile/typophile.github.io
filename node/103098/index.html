  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I liked the unusual uncial script used for Talisa Stark's letter in the most recent Game of Thrones episode:

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6i6oGTFzUVE/UZBFQbkhKPI/AAAAAAAADG4/mjdGcb5qE2Q/s1600/From+the+Set+-+Talisa%27s+Letter.jpg

So I decided to make a font out of it:

http://www.cinga.ch/type/volantene.png

I'd like to put it up on MyFonts as soon as possible...  probably I won't make it until the next episode airs, but still. I figure I'll offer it for free, since it's really more of a fan service than anything serious. That will also free me from the obligation to fill in all the annoying symbols and special characters.  ;o) I've always wanted to release a font for free to attract some attention to my foundry, and this seems like a good PR opportunity.

If you see something that needs changing, do tell me, but make it quick.  I expect to submit it within a day. I know the {B} is out of character, I'll definitely change that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Hrant: Are you assuming the font is badly made based on its short timescale, or are you seeing blatant shortcomings in the sample? In the latter case, if you'd list them here, I could do something about them and leave a better impression in the first place.  ;o)

I'm toying with the idea of pricing the font at $5, and putting up a password-protected sale that gives you the font for free if you say "hello" in Valyrian (which, frankly, is just a google away). That way, the target audience (Game of Thrones fans) are not discouraged by a credit card hurdle, while I might still make some money off the font later when the sale is over.  ;o)  Do you think that's too complicated?

The base price of $5 should also clearly state that this is not the same kind of product as my $25 fonts.

PS: I updated the link above. The new {B} is much nicer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm assuming:
- You started this very recently.
- You're not a type design god. :-)  Even though you know I like your work.

Plus you plan on releasing this today. Considering you've spent more time on your commercial releases (even though you <em>are</em> very fast) it just seems to make sense that this would probably be not as well-made, hence a poor reflection on what paying customers get. What I'm getting at is that even a free font shouldn't be too rushed.

Free-versus-minimal_price: I used to think charging a nominal amount makes sense, but then I realized it's counter to the purpose of maximum-exposure. As for a "Game of Thrones" mini-barrier, I think that makes sense for a free font, but for a paid one it does seem like too much.

<blockquote>The base price of $5 should also clearly state that this is not the same kind of product as my $25 fonts.</blockquote>

I think many people (in the realm of free/very_cheap fonts) don't pay that kind of attention. :-/  Just say it in the initial MyFonts description (which many free-font people won't even read though, but them you don't need to worry about impressing, since they very rarely buy anything - you just need them to expose your work through usage).

All that said, doing very steep introductory discounts does seem to be the go-to strategy on MyFonts:

Not quite sure I understand you right. Do you agree the mini-barrier is appropriate if the result is a free font (while is isn't free by default)?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I think a focused mini-barrier is a good idea [only] if it's free. In fact I would make it something not so easy to know, because those are the people who would be useful to you; you don't need the berserker free-font zombies.

		<div class="commentbody">@ Craig: You're right about {I}. I had thinned it a bit already, but clearly not enough. I'm not sure what you mean by narrowing {T} at the bottom, but I made the whole letter narrower; does that address the issue? I also noticed {A N M} were too dark; fixed. 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OITNAO_6650.png]

As for {X x}, I rather like them the way they are... sure, they're extra-special, but I tried more normal designs at first (including descenders on the lc), and they failed spectacularly. Maybe I just went at it the wrong way. Do you have an example of the shape you would suggest?

The font is 100% drawn on screen with Glyphs. I don't own a broad-nib pen.

@ Hrant: I don't worry about zombies downloading my font; I rather worry about people wanting my font and ending up discouraged by the barrier. Something easy to know is just fine then.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I originally was going to suggest just narrowing the T entirely, but then I thought, based on the T in the first full line of the example photo, that the crossbar might be nice if it stayed wide and "kerned" over the ensuing letter.
It's obviously an entirely different style, but my [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/teeline/ambicase-fatface/regular/glyphs/506647/314|swash X from Ambicase Fatface]] might have been in the back of my head when suggesting an X with extenders.</div>
