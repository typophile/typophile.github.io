body: "Hi Folks,\r\n\r\nAfter the success of last Fall's FontLab class, I am starting
  up another very soon. Most of you probably don't need it (it's super basic), but
  anyone who's interested is welcome.\r\n\r\nAll that entry requires is enrolling
  at <a href=\"http://www.ccsf.edu/Offices/Matriculation/step1.htm\">City College
  of San Francisco</a> and having some demonstrable command of B\xE9zier curves (like
  in Illustrator).\r\n\r\nEverything else we can take care of on the first day of
  class.\r\n\r\nGRPH 152 Digital Font Creation \r\nMondays: 1:00\u20135:00pm, Visual
  Arts 143\r\nCCSF Ocean Campus: 50 Phelan Ave.\r\n8-week course: March 20\u2013May
  15, 2006\r\nCRN 37865\r\n\r\nBTW, it's a one-unit class, making it a whopping $26!\r\n\r\nFeel
  free to email me with questions,\r\n\r\nAmy Conger\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ccsf.edu/~aconger/\">
