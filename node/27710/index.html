  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>How do letters written by a moving hand influence type design for the better and worse? The discussion over &lsquo;[[chirography]]&rsquo; in type has raged several times on Typophile.</p>
<p>I recently encountered two interesting discussions relevant to this issue. First, &lsquo;[[Printers Type in the Twentieth Century]]&rsquo; by [[Richard Southall]] discusses the &lsquo;[[Metafonts]]&rsquo; of [[Donald Knuth]]. If I understand the account of the Metafonts correctly, a spine of the letter is defined as if a stylus were drawing a thin line. Then variations of width out from that thin line are used to define a font, giving varied weights and contrasts&ndash;something like multiple masters, only different. [Knuth&rsquo;s concept is somewhat different than the ideas of G. Noordzij, which appeared at about the same time.]</p>
<p>According to the account this effort at &lsquo;chirographic&rsquo; type didn&rsquo;t really work. The modifications in weights at joins and other optical corrections couldn&rsquo;t be programmed in any easy or natural way, and so the effort was never developed further. Instead, people went over to outline fonts.</p>
<p>So score one against chirography.</p>
<p>My other encounter was with the presentations of [[Mark Jamra]] at TypeCon. He gave a fascinating account of the teaching methods of the late [[Martin Andersch]], under whom he studied and whose methods he has adapted in his own type design and teaching. Andersch, inspired by [[Rudolph Koch]]&rsquo;s late work, has the students start with &lsquo;expressionistic-interpretative writing&rsquo;. For Jamra, this involves taking an unconventional tool, dipping it in ink, and drawing a word of 3-5 letters over and over for hours on reams of paper. He says that this induces a meditative, relaxed state in which the mind and body are able to get amazing, innovative results. These are then refined on the computer to produce a digital word.</p>
<p>Jamra has posted <a href="http://typeculture.com/academic_resource/education_extras/cranbrook_2004-10-00/">examples</a> on his extensive <a href="http://typeculture.com/index.php">web site</a>. His own typefaces, including [[Kinesis]] and [[Alphatier]] were inspired by this process.</p>
<p>Jamra&rsquo;s work seems to give opposite indications from Knuth&rsquo;s: the moving hand is indeed a valuable and creative &ldquo;underlying force&rdquo; in type design, as [[Jan van Krimpen]] put it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t think you have to use quite so much paper to reach an intuitive state.
Any hand skill benefits from a warm-up period (and that would include ball sports).
Then the muscle memory kicks in and works fluidly.
Muscle memory is pliant, too, affected by other things that happen to one physically.
I haven&rsquo;t found it becomes forgetful, though, in writing&ndash;more so in music.
Altered mental states will produce different results, and there are many ways to achieve that. Basically, just get out of your rut.</div>
