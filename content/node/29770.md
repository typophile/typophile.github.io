  it gets a TrueType icon file in Windows. (I'm not sure that also happens on MAC
  platform).\r\nBut I've seen these kind of font files with the .TTF extension presenting
  an Opentype font icon. I know DaltonMaag uses this.\r\n\r\nHow can this be done?\r\n\r\nI'm
  selling fonts with this format (for better screen hinting), but the .TTF extension

  font.\r\n\r\nmany regards from sunny Brazil ;)\r\n\r\nFabio"

    are a safe way to ensure that the font you're dealing with is an original creation
    of a certain foundry. If a font was modified, the digital signature becomes invalid
    (or is not included at all). Some foundries, e.g. Linotype, use DSIG to check
    if a font that a customer is complaining about is an unmodified Linotype original
    or if it was \"touched\" by someone and therefore \"the warranty is void\". You
    could view DSIGs as some sort of \"warranty seal\". \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    a digital certificate in his own name, and then choose to offer a service of using

    who are happy in their simplistic view of the world that goes like \"Microsoft
    is bad, others are good\". \r\n\r\nTherefore, I guess it will be a huge shock
    for you to learn that this has very little to do with being an \"MS proprietary
    standard\". The Authenticode code signing certificates are X.509 IETF certificates
    issued for a particular purpose and packaged in a particular, Microsoft-specific
    way. However, there are opensource tools that can convert a code signing X.509
    certificate into an Authenticode code signing certificate, and the format of the
    Microsoft packaging of digital certificate is widely published. \r\n\r\nX.509
    digital certificates are an IETF international standard, and are used widely on
    the WWW, for example in SSL (https) encryption. They all cost money, even those
    that you use on an opensource Apache server. This has to do with the fact that
    the certification authorities that issue the certificates are companies that have
    costs of operation and (since they are companies) their purpose is to make money.
    \r\n\r\nThis, per se, has nothing to do with Microsoft, but I guess where you
    live ranting against \"M$\" is just an easy way to escape the complex reality.
    \r\n\r\nTip for the future: do some background reading before publicly announcing
    your conclusions. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam \r\n"
