body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm not actually writing a bachelor thesis about typography but
  I do want it to look nice, and above all easy to read.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think
  about Merriweather set at 10 / 16 with an appropriate column width. http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather\r\n\r\nAlso
  I'm looking for a cool sans-serif font that combines well with Merriweather for
  the chapter titles. I might use all caps. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThank,\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Is this for screen or print? Your \"10/16\" makes me think it's the latter.\r\n\r\nMerriweather
    is heavily optimized for onscreen text - its x-height is pretty massive. In print
    such proportions are suited for very small text - nothing close to sizes good
    for extended reading. Plus it doesn't have an Italic (at least not yet).\r\n\r\nTrying
    to think of typefaces in that genre... Maybe one of these:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/person/Dieter_Hofrichter/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "According to the designer, Eben Sorkin:\r\n\"Merriweather was designed to
    be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens.\"\r\n\r\nI would not consider
    using a font designed to display properly on a screen for printing on paper regardless
    of the printing method. It may not look as it should; in fact, it probably won't.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it is a design commissioned by Google; they paid rock-bottom prices to the designers
    so I would not want to depend upon their quality."

    at least there's less reason to worry: Eben does know his thing - he has a Masters
    in type design from Reading. Plus I know him personally and I can attest that
    he's quite quality-minded.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant and George,\r\n\r\nIt's for print. Despite the large x-height I
    thought it might work, but I guess it's off the table now. Also I must have overlooked
    the fact that there are no italics. (wich is a problem)\r\n\r\nI'm really fond
    of your suggestions Hrant, but since I'am a 'poor student' I can't afford to buy
    nice fonts for my thesis. I will remember the foundry for commercial jobs though.\r\n\r\nI
    think Merriweather is a great font, you can see it's designed with love and care.
    Do you know any free (or really cheap) alternatives that have the same  friendly,
    modern, serif style quality as Merriweather?\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    comes in Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic -- plus a huge character set. There
    are two versions: Gentium and Gentium Plus.  Both are free, with an Open Source
    License.\r\n\r\nIf you like it, be sure and use the one from the SIL website for
    print; there is a webfont version available through Google fonts."

    Brill, but they still both feel a bit old fashioned.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions
    though."
