  body: Can't tell for sure, but some of the characteristic letters are really reminiscent
    of Permanent Bold, a Ludwig & Mayer grotesque from the early 60's. Maybe there
    are also a few irregularities stemming from the transfer of the design to wood
    type.

  body: "Tough riddle. Not quite Permanent though.\r\nSome caps are similar to \u201CNormal
    Grotesk\u201D which was a design cast by many foundries pre ww2 under different
    names like Edel-Grotesk, Aurora, Favourit etc, at least in metal.\r\n\r\nIn fact,
    the type looks rather handmade, the figures even like not really belonging to
    the rest, the 3\u2019s differ quite a bit. (The 2 feels very Nebiolo.)\r\n\r\nWould
    be easier with lowercase. Or do you have any rough information about age and where
    it comes from?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/permanent_6156.jpg]\r\n\r\nPermanent\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Normal_4171.jpg]\r\n\r\nNormal

  body: "According to Jaspert, Berry & Johnson's <em>Encyclopaedia of Typefaces</em>,
    4ed, 1970, kupfers Permanent specimen is labelled Medium and seems somewhat lighter
    in colour than Dash_X's specimen. Permanent Bold is definitely darker and the
    numerals are all notably narrower. It might be helpful to see the lower case alphabet.
    The specimen's letters that have rounded strokes seem a little squarish. Perhaps
    that is why kupfers showed us Normal Grotesk. The irregularities are quite intriguing.\r\n\r\nPermanent
    was designed by German calligrapher [[http://www.kghoefer.de/English/KgHoefer_Typefaces.html|Karlgeorg
    Hoefer]], also known for the Monsun (Monsoon) display face from Klingspor and
    script faces Elegance (Ludwig & Mayer), Saltino and Salto (Klingspor) and the
    curious tinted Zebra from Stempel among others.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find another
    similar typeface amongst those displayed in the EoT quite like the specimen fount.\r\n\r\nPS
    kupfers: your kupferschrift.de is a very interesting web site, I'm glad you also
    write in English, my German is practically non-existent. Thanks for sharing."
