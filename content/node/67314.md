  body: "Thank you both for your taking the time to examine and respond. I appreciate
    it.\r\n\r\nThe Mr. and Mrs. isn't Copperplate Gothic or Engravers Gothic, if you
    notice the Es and Fs have a very high middle bar or whatever you would call it.
    Also the Mr. and Mrs. have more pronounced serifs."

    not seeing what you're talking about. The crossbars on the 'E's and 'F's match
    those of Engraver's Gothic.\r\n\r\n<cite>Also the Mr. and Mrs. have more pronounced
