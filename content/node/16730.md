body: okay, so there's been a bit of buzz on typophile recently about the OT feature
  for  Glyph Composition/Decomposition (ccmp). It made me wonder... how appropriate
  would it be to use this feature for transliteration say from roman letters to cyrillic.
  Is this kosher? or would this be better filed off under stylistic sets or something?
  Is this even a good idea? Any comments are welcome.

    is a character level operation, it should not be done in glyph processing."

  body: "Paul, \r\n\r\nI agree with John. Transliteration through replacing glyphs
    without changing the character stream (in sort, what I would call a transglyphication)
    is an operation that is not considered \"legitimate\" in the Unicode/OpenType
    world. \r\n\r\nI do believe that there is room for transglyphications in fonts,
    but you'd be better off just preparing a special-purpose font for that rather
    than employing a legitimate feature. In fact, I myself prepared a font for my
    own use which uses Latin glyphs to represent all sorts of Unicide codepoints:
    Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic. I'm not extremely fluent in reading Russian and Arabic,
    so when I doi it, I sometimes switch to my transglyphication font: me eye can
    simply grasp streams of Latin glyph much faster. \r\n\r\nAnother transglyphication
    font I made was a font that represents each Unicode codepoint by a box with the
    hexadecimal representation of the Unicode codepoint in it -- useful for testing
    purposes. \r\n\r\nSuch font have their (limited) use but I don't think it makes
    any sense to include thesew functionalities in a \"proper\" Unicode-based OpenType
    font intended for real text. It's better to make a separate font that clearly
    marks itself as special-purpose. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "I don't know any languages written in Cyrillic, but I know some Hebrew and
    know that transliteration from it is basically a nightmare. There is a 'scientific,'
    systematic way, but it doesn't give much clue to an English speaker unless they
    already know Hebrew and mentally transliterate back to Hebrew! There are all kinds
    of ways that people try to make transliterations that will pronounce correctly,
    more or less, but no standard. And then you have the Hebrew to Greek to Latin
    to English spellings of Biblical figures, which add to the mess.\r\n\r\nThe standard
    pin-yin system for pronouncing Chinese--a romanization--is pretty darn good, but
    then there is no alphabet to start with. (Actually I've heard some Chinese say
    that the old Chinese phonetic alphabet--pobomofo--is better, but now everyone
    uses pin-yin with the computer.)   \r\n\r\nIs there a standard transliteration
    from Cyrillic to Roman characters? As pronounced in what language?  \r\n\r\nOh,
    with the keyboard for Hebrew, you can get them with the Hebrew corresponding to
    similarly pronounced English letters, where they exist, or with the Hebrew lay-out.
    The vowel points are another headache on the keyboard. "
