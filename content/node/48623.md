  know what typeface \"DEUTSCHER WEINBRAND\" is set in or something comparable. Would
  be curious about the other face as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!"

  body: "Well, first of all, the lettering of 'Scharlachberg' has a very clear similar
    font in a revival of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/teutonia/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Teutonia</a> by Tom Wallace -- and it's on sale right now for
    a ridiculously low price of $7!\r\n\r\nI would bet that at least 'Scharlachberg'
    and 'MEISTERBRAND' are hand lettered. I found an image of a poster using the same
    marks dating from 1965, so it is at least that old."

  body: "MEISTERBRAND\u2019 was done in the style of German/Austrian Art Nouveau lettering
    ala <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/kunstler-grotesk/\" target=\"_blank\">K\xFCnstler
    Grotesk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/larisch/\" target=\"_blank\">Larisch</a>
    and (the one that came to mind right away for your purposes) <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/secession/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Secession</a> - all revivals from that period.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    the very different Teutonia is, nevertheless, from the same period and style.\r\n\r\nOthers
    are more qualified to help with your main quest, David."

  body: "DEUTSCHER WEINBRAND doesn't look quite like any type I can name. The A top
    serif is not very common, the serifs are generally rather long, and the letters
    appear wider than most text typefaces. The slightly squared look of the letters,
    and that W remind me of some of Hermann Zapf's typefaces, and I think [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/melior/|Melior]]
    is closest, but it does not have this A.\r\n\r\nAnother typeface that it reminded
    me of is [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_a/antikva_margaret_full.gif|Antikva
    Margaret]], but this is only in general feel. The details are not close at all.

  body: thanks so much everyone! I really appreciate everyone's input, very interesting
    to read. I dug the top of the "A" but was having a real tough time narrowing it
    down. Was curious to see what other people thought!
