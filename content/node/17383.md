body: "I'm a student studying graphic design at algonquin college. I am currently
  trying to develop my first font, and was hoping to get some comments on what I have
  so far. I wanted to make a modern looking serif, so i modeled the curves after Eurostile,
  condensed it, and added some serifs. I also distressed it a little bit, to make
  it look like it is from the pages of an old book. I want to make sure that my font
  doesn't look too much like eurostile.\r\n\r\nAny comments would be much appreciated.\r\nThanks."

  body: try saving it in RGB and repost the image, please. A pdf would also be helpful
    in critiquing your font.

  body: It doesn't look like Eurostile, and it's not without its grungy charm, but
    the name is AWFUL!

    would suggest to 'distress' the bowl of the lowercase 'a' even more, cause it
    screams eurostile. \r\n"

  body: "\u2022 lacks subtlety & detail\r\n\r\n\u2022 for grunge to be convincing
    it has to look detailed and natural. As it is your grunge finish looks contrived
    and phoney\r\n\r\n<em>I also distressed it a little bit, to make it look like
    it is from the pages of an old book.</em>\r\n\r\n\u2022 a \"modern-looking serif\"
    that \"look[s] like its from the pages of an old book\"? (scratching head) That
    makes it contradictory and hard to justify as in terms of style and appeal. A
    lot of designers won't see the sense in the combination.\r\n\r\n\u2022 you really
    need to define the purpose of the design. What kind of subject matter or context
    would it be used for?\r\n\r\n\u2022 ask yourself, \"Does the world really need
    a grunged-up Eurostile with ad-hoc serifs?\"\r\n\r\n\u2022 serif positions and
    the lack of authentic humanist/antiqua features won't please most roman type buyers
    (when in Roma, do as the Romans do)\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nj a m e s"
