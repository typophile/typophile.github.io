<p>There&rsquo;s obviously a lot of feeling about the recent trend of launching fonts with 80-90% discounts. Some foundries say it cheapens fonts, and some are forced to emulate the offers in order to be noticed. As a marketing technique, it really works well in the short term as it pushes the new fonts quickly up the sales charts, but after the sale&rsquo;s ended, how long do they stick around?</p>
<p>The sales charts at MyFonts are based solely on dollar value, so a font family at $5 has to sell ten times as many as one at $50 to reach the same chart position. I had an idea for weighting the charts in favour of more realistically priced fonts:</p>
<p>Font Family X - standard price $200, 90% intro offer = $20 each family
Font Family Y - standard price $200, 50% intro offer = $100 each family
Font Family Z - standard price $200, 0% intro offer = $200 each family</p>
<p>As it stands, to reach the same position, X needs to sell five times as many as Y, which needs to sell twice as much as Z.
If the sales charts mechanism was changed such that the dollar value received was also affected by the offer price, say by taking half the offer percentage off the resulting price (only for working out chart position), the prices of each font above (in terms of how the chart sees them) would be:</p>
<p>Font Family X - standard price $200, 90% intro offer = $20 each family . minus 45% = $11
Font Family Y - standard price $200, 50% intro offer = $100 each family . minus 25% = $75
Font Family Z - standard price $200, 0% intro offer = $200 each family . minus 0% = $200</p>
<p>Clearly, the more heavily discounted fonts now need to sell even more in relation to non discounted fonts to reach the same position in the chart. There is still a marketing advantage to putting your fonts on offer, but the more ridiculous offers would not be as effective as they are now.</p>
<p>What do think? Is this fair? I&rsquo;m undecided, but I think the system as it is now is starting to force foundries making decent fonts to discount heavily in order to keep up with not-so-decent fonts. If it continues, it won&rsquo;t be long before every new release is 99% off for a month then never sells again after that. If a new system could be shown to give more long term sales, that can only be a good thing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So your plan is to convince MyFonts to change their ranking policy? To prevent foundries from harming their brand out of desperation for a good ranking? What&rsquo;s in it for MyFonts? Maybe they <em>like</em> it this way?</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m not sure that a brand is damaged because of discounting. Jeremy Tankard has a very strong brand, but he discounts up to <em>95%</em> (if only for one day). After all, the best way to build a brand is to get people to use your stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Fair points. As I said, I&rsquo;m undecided. I wouldn&rsquo;t ask MyFonts to change anything; they&rsquo;ve been good to me! It was just an idea. I&rsquo;m not really concerned about cheapening my brand by putting things on offer. If I was overly concerned with my &lsquo;brand&rsquo; I&rsquo;d have ditched a load of fonts by now. I guess I just feel for newer foundries whose only way of gaining exposure is to underprice. I have a feeling this pricing model may just be a trend that is unsustainable in the long run. I hope so anyway.
My worry is that customers may stop buying any fonts at full price, knowing that vastly discounted fonts are never far away. Hopefully though, this may cause foundries to make ever more interesting and different fonts, as big discounts cease to be a factor in separating their fonts from others', because virtually all fonts are hugely discounted.
BTW, I don&rsquo;t wish to come across like I&rsquo;m saying all fonts with big discounts are bad, or that big discounts are inherently a bad thing. I just wanted to carry on the discussion where participants could use more than 140 characters!</div>

<p>No one is forced to anything. Those are “market penetration” offers. They are supposed to reach an audience which has over 100.000 fonts to choose from and hundreds of new Twitter messages every day. So for a short period of time you make a loud offer people can&rsquo;t resist and by this you spread the word. That&rsquo;s it.
Those fonts don&rsquo;t sell because they are in the bestseller list, but because of the offer itself, which is such a good deal that people start to spread the news and that creates the snowball effect. So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s caused by the list or it&rsquo;s calculation.</p>
<p><cite> If it continues, it won&rsquo;t be long before every new release is 99% off for a month … </cite></p>
<p>Certainly, that will happen for some fonts.</p>
<p><cite>… then never sells again after that. </cite></p>
<p>MyFonts is just a retailer. It&rsquo;s up to the foundry to keep the sales up and there are many different strategies to achieve this. A bestseller list is just that. It shows what sells. It can&rsquo;t weigh anything to support “quality fonts”. 
Maybe they could start an “Editor’s choice” section where quality fonts are suggested, but I don&rsquo;t think we need to blame the calculation of the bestseller list for how foundries set up their pricing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>Take a look at MyFonts' [[http://www.myfonts.com/bestsellers/ | best sellers list]], instead of the Hot New Fonts list. I might be wrong, but nothing on the best sellers list is currently on an introductory sale, but there&rsquo;s plenty on there that were. That would seem to indicate that the penetration idea works, and that sales are sustained afterwards by a font&rsquo;s higher visibility. There&rsquo;s also fonts on there that were promoted by other methods, such as free weights (which remain free, by the way – no restrictions there).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>imo: The intent of introduction offers like these is to get the fonts in the market in a fair volume. My reasoning is that a lot of designers (maybe not to sure about their knowledge in this field) are wont to go for what is used by their ‘well-known’ contemporaries.</p>
<p>Mr Buivenga’s fonts are exemplars: they have become very popular, clearly because they have been used in high profile material.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As Ralf notes, it was the foundries, not MyFonts, that developed the concept of extreme introductory discounts.  Probably the first full family sold at a breath-taking introductory price on MyFonts was HVD’s Pluto in mid-2011; it has remained a seller at full price. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Hannes was inspired by the high-profile introduction of Axel (a Spiekermann production) two years earlier by FontShop Germany at less than €/$ 20 for a four-weight family.<br>
While typohiles (including some of us at MyFonts) may have mixed feelings about the trend, it does have its positive aspects. Typically, non-pro and semi-pro customers have always bought single weights, even when volume discounts on larger (text) families were substantial. Thanks to the family-at-the-price-of-one-weight craze, average users have become familiar with the idea of buying an entire type family, which  to many always seems to have looked like a rather extravagant and unnecessary kind of purchase. So while some argue that low prices teach people a wrong thing (fonts can be cheap) it might also teach them something  good: fonts don’t necessarily come one at a time.</div>

<li>The growth of a market into a new field. 
As Jan already mentioned: MyFonts opened up a new market. If you look at MyFonts’ homepage you clearly see, that those offers are not meant for the same kind of people font licenses were sold 15 years ago. The design studios buying the 500–1000 Dollar packages are still very important, but there is now a huge market of individuals who are willing to spent 20 to 50 bucks for a font. And with deep family discounts they might even purchase licenses for those. 
I don&rsquo;t see anything bad about it. Especially as long as those are only introductory offers. After the first 45 days, a quality typeface will still be a quality typeface available for regular prices.</li>

<p>No. Every foundry needs to find its market and the appropriate strategies. We can&rsquo;t go all for the same people who only go for these sale prices. If we do that, it would stop working. In the same way as we shouln’t do it all like Exljbris or TEFF is doing it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">If I were licensing retail fonts through a major distributor like MyFonts, I would be inclined to try a kind of Reverse Dutch Auction release pricing. A Dutch auction involves a gradually reducing price for a limited commodity (classically, flowers). A reverse Dutch auction seems to me a good model for an unlimited, digital product, for which the price gradually increases over time. So begin with a massively deep discount for, say, a week, and then start incrementally increasing it up to the full retail price. The latter could either be a fixed amount comparable to other fonts, or simply at whatever level the particular font continues to sell an average of X licenses per week. Just an idea. I&rsquo;ve no idea how well it would work in practice, so don&rsquo;t blame me if you try it and end up unhappy with the results. If you do try it, please let us know how it goes.</div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought I had recently. Let&rsquo;s say this movement continues, and &lsquo;normally&rsquo; priced fonts don&rsquo;t sell well anymore, somewhere in the future. Could we not simply conclude that due to the large amount of quality fonts, foundries have to compete more, and the market equilibrium has shifted? End of the golden days for font designers? Perhaps it&rsquo;s been a bubble that&rsquo;s about to burst.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh I think it should be a well-advertised pricing structure. Although the calculations differ, the idea is the same as for a regular Dutch auction, to enable the buyer to make reasoned decisions within a predictable structure. Because Dutch auctions apply to limited commodities, there is an element of gamble involved in waiting for a lower price (someone else might be willing to pay more, and you&rsquo;ll be left with nothing). In my reverse model, with rising price, there is no gamble but there is pressure to buy early, increasing upfront revenue, but without the simple jump from deeply discounted to full price. I see it also as a useful tool for designers dealing with clients: &ldquo;This is the font we want to use for your job, but the longer you delay decisions/budget/PO the more it is going to cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other benefit I see in the model is that it provides a trackable progress of sales relative to price &ndash; adjusting for other factors &ndash;, which is something sellers generally lack. The process by which the &lsquo;market&rsquo; determines price is generally pretty much guesswork: a seller looks at similar products, and guesses how much he might be able to charge. He typically has no data to tell him whether he might, in fact, make more money selling at a slightly lower price or if he might sell the same volume at a slightly higher price. By gradually increasing the price over time, one can collect information on buying behaviour relative to price.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary! The prices fall because of the higher demand! There is no definition of »normal« font prices. It&rsquo;s just what we are used to. A photolettering disc did cost 20 times what a font costs today and it only had around 200 characters and could not be used indefinitely, let alone be copied to 5 machines. 
There is nothing wrong with falling prices when the number of sales rises, especially with digital goods.</p>

<p>That’s not the way the Long Tail works, and MyFonts is very much a Long Tail marketer in a Long Tail product category.</p>
<p>For instance, Shinntype rarely has fonts in the MyFonts top 50 and doesn’t offer huge introductory discounts or free anything, but this distributor provides us with a steady income from incremental sales of many typefaces, some of which (Beaufort and Handsome) have been there since MyFonts started over 12 years ago.</p>
<p>Fonts differ from most (consumer) products in that they are not fundamentally subject to rapid obsolesence or the immediate hard sell of a special offer. When someone is looking for a font for a particular project, especially when doing a keyword search, they will consider a variety of typefaces, not just what’s hot at the moment. They might remember something that caught their fancy several years ago, but which they haven’t yet had the opportunity to use.</p>
<p>Typefaces can become fashion items, but they are also extremely durable, both stylistically and technologically.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if one applies the Long Tail or Zipf distribution to itself, it becomes apparent that while one end of the curve is subject to fashion, price, and popularity, a large part of the market does not follow these principles.</p>
<p>For instance, the Scotch Modern is not presently considered a good text type, and the Shinntype version is very expensive, has never been discounted, and has never made a best-seller list. Yet once in a while someone somewhere decides they gotta have it. Niche.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If I may jump in one more time, I think the reality is that because certain fonts are ubiquitous, and it is only a subset of users who are even interested enough to care, the niche for fonts is just that, a niche; if it works better for designer &ldquo;A&rdquo; to build extremely high-quality fonts with full character sets and s/he is able to sell that work at a price which is fair to their efforts, great. On the other end, if designer &ldquo;B&rdquo; is just messing around and wants to sell some of their hobbyist labours for $5-20 a shot, and they sell a few, great. I know my co-worker at the small office where I work is pretty oblivious to fonts, whereas to me, they mean and signify a great deal.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s like the book market; mass-market low quality Harlequins sell because they fill a niche, and high end literary books sell because they fill a niche. The Harlequin will generally make a greater profit, but there is no question which is the better quality book.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I started noticing these 90% discounts I thought, &ldquo;This is an industry on its knees.&rdquo; As a consumer it made me feel very uncertain about my vendors (ie: people I buy fonts from). 90% discounts indicates an uncertainty about product value, as well as a great deal of semantic ambiguity when we try to define price and value to our end clients using product terminology that applies to physical objects, even as an analogy (any discussion about piracy, EULA, licensing fees tends to wander into this word-territory).</p>
<p>When I go and spend 600 euro on a font I will email the designer and ask if they respect their product enough to not go and have a fire sale next week. And if there is a fire sale, I want a refund on the difference. Granted, this discussion mostly pertains to new releases.</p>
<p>I like John Hudson&rsquo;s idea. It&rsquo;s rational and it provides motivation for buying. And that&rsquo;s the key: it&rsquo;s rational. The massive discount model (a discount ending when? and why?) has no explicit rational foundation &ndash; by which I mean the buyer or end-user can&rsquo;t determine the reason. Sure, I&rsquo;m seeing the reason in this thread, but not at the point of purchase.</p>
<p>And the real end user, the final client, what do I say to them? &ldquo;Well, this font&rsquo;s not as good but it costs 99 cents at a 95% discount.&rdquo; Most people have never heard of discounts like that except on flawed or blemished goods; goods that don&rsquo;t work properly; children&rsquo;s toys made of lead at a night market.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I want beautiful work-horse typefaces that I have to pay a fair bit of money for and not everyone can afford. Snobbery? Yes: an arbitrary taste-making distinction. Fortunately, I&rsquo;m well served by dealing directly with the foundry.</p>
<p>All of this leads me to think the 90% discounts harm the myfonts brand more than anything else. Mostly because their top-seller charts are unreliable indicators.</p>

<p>Try that idea on the stock market. ;-)
When you buy something, you and the seller have agreed on the “worth” of that product at that time. That&rsquo;s it. The deal is closed. If the font is cheaper tomorrow, how does it affect you? It&rsquo;s the same font. Nothing has changed. You have willingly agreed that the font was 600 Euros worth to you and you got it for that price. There is nothing that you can or should do.</p>

Many retailers guarantee your paid price, and will refund the difference if the price drops or if you find it cheaper elsewhere. That&rsquo;s after the purchase and for a limited period of time. I recently had this conversation with a foundry. It&rsquo;s a strange conversation to have. Fortunately, they did not share your opinion. Because we are two human beings.</p>
<p>The stock market is something else entirely where the assumption of risk is understood.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a dreamer but I still believe trust is an essential aspect of a commercial transaction. Trust is the underwriter. If we didn&rsquo;t have trust (and humanity) as part of the transaction, then I would just steal fonts.</p>
<p>*unreliable indicators
I was thinking of it as an indicator of the quality of a font. Not the quality of the typeface. Of the font itself, which is measurable. I&rsquo;m probably delusional on this one.</p>

<p>If you think a seller has acted inappropriately, you most certainly should do something. Also, this black-and-white view clearly does not correspond to reality, especially not in the US: people get sellers to give them money back without &ldquo;having to&rdquo; all the time. When Apple dropped the price of the iPod (or maybe it was the iPhone) by a big amount a few years ago, people complained and Apple gave recent buyers a $100 voucher. So go ahead and complain away!

I like the reverse Dutch auction idea, especially if governed by units sold rather than time. At present, this style of discounting is not possible at MyFonts, where you can put your fonts on sale for a set period of time, and must wait another set period of time between sales. I think (I considered it!) it might be possible to do by issuing voucher codes, but then you have the situation where you have to find a way of publicising those codes. I guess foundries with enough following could do this pre-release on Twitter, but then these foundries probably don&rsquo;t need the discounts to shift fonts.</div>

<p>Ralf, the reality is that many customers simply don&rsquo;t think the way you describe. If the price drops a great deal on something bought the day before, many people don&rsquo;t just feel unlucky, they feel betrayed. And quite often that feeling is entirely rational because companies don&rsquo;t decide to lower a price 5 minutes before, they&rsquo;ve already decided at the time you bought it for the higher price. And when people feel betrayed by a company, the company pays for it - either by having to give back money or credit, or by losing a future customer (often due to word-of-mouth).</p>
<p>In many US department stores when you&rsquo;re about to buy something at full price, they will actually tell you to wait until the next day when the item will be discounted! Are they stupid to do that? I think they&rsquo;re very clever. And try using an expired coupon at almost any fast-food place: does it work? Yes. Think about why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Retail businesses don&rsquo;t get rich by being fascist about rules.</p>

I once tried an offer whereby a purchaser of a new font could choose another from my library for free, thinking this would add to the desirability of the new font without hindering any possible performance in the sales ranking.

The Linotype sales are rather interesting examples – limited to just a few hundred units sold and for only a day or so (whichever comes first).
<p>In terms of techniques to cut through the avalanche of very similar products and promotions, it could be very effective.</p>
<p>It might not make the most of the extra exposure new fonts are automatically granted on MyFonts, but doing some moderate discounting later on in the life cycle of a font might be an alternative option.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s something very different. If you would want to make that comparison, it would mean that a web shop like MyFonts would offer you a refund if you find the same font on FontShop.com. MyFonts would be willing to give up a little bit of their(!) profit in order to have you buy it on their website. The maker of that product (in this case the foundry) isn&rsquo;t even involved in this deal.
So those retailers fighting over the cheapest offer is something very different from makers of products setting up their prices (including sale offers).</p>
<p>And if you want to compare it with physical goods: Every season there are new clothes, and when the next season starts, there will be heavy discounts for the same products. Do you expect refunds when you paid the full price? It&rsquo;s the very same good offered for very different prices. The only thing that has changed is the time of the purchase.</p>
<p><cite>The stock market is something else entirely where the assumption of risk is understood.</cite></p>
<p>My point was: the two sides agree about worth and price. Why should a buying option for other (future) customers make a difference? If I decide to double the price of my font tomorrow, because it sells like hot cake, can I then come to you as someone who bought it yesterday, and ask for 100% more? I guess not!
You will say: a deal is a deal. If you don&rsquo;t want pay that additional price, then you also shouln’t ask for a refund, should the prices drop for a temporary sale offer.</p>
<p><cite>Maybe I&rsquo;m a dreamer but I still believe trust is an essential aspect of a commercial transaction. </cite></p>
<p>Certainly! Now that there are over 100.000 fonts available and the font makers can’t control the prices thru proprietary typesetting machines anymore, the human connection between buyer and sellers becomes very important. Maybe not if you buy at fonts.com, but certainly for all the independent foundries. 
But this trust doesn’t mean that I will keep my prices unchanged forever, so existing customers can still “feel good” about their purchases. You got the product you wanted and you got it for a price you considered acceptable at the time of the purchase. There is nothing to feel bad about, should the prices change (in one direction or the other).</p>

<p>Really? We find our fonts available for free all the time, so paying customers could do the same thing every day or so later. That&rsquo;s usually 100% off, which isn&rsquo;t very fractional, but still, it&rsquo;s hardy hypothetical either.</p>

The MyFonts current listing of “special offers” (WHAT is special??) counts several hundreds of fonts. Being buried in yet another huge mass of offerings, is this really the means to get noticed?
I did a modest christmas offering last year, on the Dec. sales report I noticed no effect at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A very interesting discussion! I have bought several families for big discounts. It suits me fine because as a freelance designer it allows me to expand my toolbox at a low cost. That said: there is a lot of stuff on offer that even at 90% off don&rsquo;t convince me.</p>
<p>The market is quite saturated with certain types of fonts, like big sans-serif families, and I have seen several big sans families up on 90% sale. I guess it is the cheapest way to get noticed, without any other marketing money spent. But I also think the effect of these deep discounts will diminish when there are so many of them, and quality and distinction will win in the end. How many neutral sans families does one really need in the end? Add to that that many of these families released seem to be made on auto-pilot: automized kerning and spacing, automatically generated weights and character sets&hellip;</p>

<p>If they are at all rational to in the first place, regular prices, or those who pay them, are subsidizing the &ldquo;deep discounts&rdquo;.  If a lower price equals more sales, then just lower the price. The deep discount theory is just a spiraling race to be bottom.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work of course. The sale works because it is temporary. You get something that is usually “worth” more for less money than usual and you need to decide fast. 
If the price is always low, it’s just a cheap (and therefore probably low quality) font. No one will share this offer, it won&rsquo;t make the bestseller list and you can postpone your purchase decision indefinitely — which means you will probably forget it after a while.</p>
<p><cite>Let the madness end.</cite></p>
<p>The simple rules of supply and demand. If people think those offers are bad, then don’t buy those fonts. As long as those offers are a good deal for the customer and the foundry, they will not stop. And why should they if both sides are happy?</p>

If I already want a specific font or family, a 10-30% discount will be enough to convince me to buy now. 
At 50% I might consider a font that appeals to me, but I would not consider buying at the full price. But it still is a decision, because it still amounts to something like 100$ or more in most cases. 
With 80-99% I would buy something I would not otherwise buy (if they are not obviously poor quality, that is), as the investment cost is very low, and who knows?, it might be useful in the future.</div>

An initial discounted price kickstarts that process. How deep that discount should be is another question, but since this is a form of advertising, there is likely to be pressure for lower and lower introductory prices as more foundries do it.</div>

My other pay fonts sales figures have remained essentially unchanged, but over one thousand people know now something, and have their opinion, about Alter Littera (in spite of these opinions not having been, for the most part, publicly expressed &hellip;).</div>

Don't be sorry: it is definitely moot indeed, unless you are so naive as to expect starting a new foundry off and becoming the king of the hill at the same time. The same (over)dose of patience employed to carefully craft a new font should be exercised while waiting for recognition and decent sales figures (if they ever happen to arrive). But when "over one thousand people" know something about your work and, more importantly, have the chance to put their hands on it, I like to think that at least a few of them will keep track of you and, eventually, will contribute to your success. This is the fundamental role that, in my opinion, free fonts should play.</div>

Sorry to burst your bubble but I think it&rsquo;s very unlikely the vast majority of those free(down)loaders know anything about you or your foundry. Check the orders - see how many &lsquo;customers&rsquo; have downloaded your free fonts more than once. If yours are anything like mine, you&rsquo;ll find a LOT have done so, which should prove to you that free downloads (of single fonts at any rate - I don&rsquo;t know about free members of families) add up to pretty much nothing in terms of brand awareness. People are just downloading everything that comes up in the &lsquo;free&rsquo; search results. They will probably hardly look at them, let alone use them in any way which might get you some recognition / free advertising. For all my bugbears about big introductory (and midlife) discounts, at least those customers are paying something, which does make them far more likely to use the fonts in a way which might lead to some exposure.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At this point in this discussion about font pricing, it seems to be necessary to remind everyone about the most basic facts.</p>
<p>There are two basic groups of customers (or, at least, users) for fonts.</p>
<p>There are serious users, i.e. magazine art departments. Paying $200 for an appropriate font is totally routine for them.</p>
<p>And then there are people looking for a font to print an internal company announcement, a church bulletin, or for personal use.</p>
<p>Getting someone in Group #2, though, to pay even $20 for a font is difficult. It involves getting a petty cash signature, or using a credit card online (scary!). So of course people in that category will search out legitimate free fonts, poor quality 2,000-font CD collections, or the Bitstream collections on Corel products first&hellip; or just use what came with Windows.</p>
<p>That they will refrain from pirating your fonts is about all you can hope for; that they will send money your way is almost a forlorn hope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no end-run around that brutal reality that I can suggest; and, thus, lowered prices are more likely to cut into revenue from your real market than generate new customers from this second group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just some obscure mental barrier against valuing typography that&rsquo;s at work here; instead, more concrete factors - logistical barriers against payment and a lack of perceived need for most specific fonts - are in operation. And a discount, even to a ridiculously low price (i.e., $5 or even $1) won&rsquo;t address the real problem.</p>
<p>I suppose if a bunch of independent type designers got together, and made a disk of &ldquo;1000 contemporary quality fonts&rdquo; that got physically sold on store shelves, they might then be able to share (some fraction of) one cent per font per sale - but even that wouldn&rsquo;t work in real life (difficult distribution channel to access; unlike the Bitstream collection, customers reached would react with &lsquo;what good are all these weird fonts&rsquo;&hellip;).</p>
<p>So I think that typeface designers risk losing a lot of money in chasing a mythical El Dorado in looking for a broader market for fonts that simply can&rsquo;t be coaxed into existence. If you can create the next Times Roman or Papyrus, and then license it to Microsoft, great, but not everyone can <em>do</em> that.</p>
<p>In your pricing, then, look to your serious customers, not to vain hopes.</p>

I take your point. However, I think that a ratio of 0.98 (991/1013) between customers and orders provides a reasonable chance of getting noticed. The problem with most free fonts, as well as with many heavily discounted ones, is that they are pure rubbish, but this does not mean that every one of them should be regarded as such.
Also, reading many of the posts in this topic, could make anyone feel tempted to think that trying to sell new, decent-quality fonts is a hopeless effort irrespective of how they are promoted (unless, of course, you dive into the current sans/script trendy tide, which, personally, I absolutely dislike). Nonetheless, I prefer to keep alive the (possibly vain) hope that offering free quality fonts will turn potential customers into actual buyers of your pay fonts, at least in a small percentage. Time will tell &hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, thanks for explaining. I guess two answers -in fact in any case- are: because they think the font is special in some way; they like to spend money. People buy all kinds of junk they don&rsquo;t really need as long as it&rsquo;s cheap enough, and sometimes as long as it&rsquo;s expensive enough! You and I might not be such peons, but very many people are.</p>
<p>BTW, my own involvement in the retail market is indeed pretty modest, but it does go back to the early 90s, and does involve a recent font that was discounted by 75% for the first two weeks (from which I learned a bit).</p>

<p>are you serious? A big chunk of font buyers are freelance designers or smaller agencies. Of course they have to watch their budget, so promotions and discounts help. Trying to heap them in the category of amateurs not willing to pay 20 bucks for a font is childish and not helpful.</p>

<p>I fall into that category sometimes.

Just a few weeks ago I did a project for free and bought a font that was on sale.</p>

I think if the font is good, yes, the introductory discounts lead to wider usage which will probably lead to more exposure over time and keep the font selling at full price. If the font is not so good, I think the initial sales will be a flash in the pan and sales will quickly dry up to what they would have been anyway (ie. not many). A look on the MyFonts best sellers list turns up many fonts which were initially discounted, and have stuck around, but these are for the most part the better ones. The one 'not so great' font that I had in mind is currently plummeting down the best seller list as, I'm guessing, at full price, nobody's interested.
<p>I wonder how many of the people buying previously discounted fonts at full price know that they were on offer. If I were a font buyer, I can imagine if I knew a font had been discounted by around 30%, I might think, &ldquo;oh well, missed that sale. Nevermind, I&rsquo;ll buy it anyway,&rdquo; but if it had been heavily discounted, I might feel a little vexed, not purchase it at the vastly inflated price, and probably wait for it to come on sale again.</p>
<blockquote>What I mean is, does it help the sales of type designers if their fonts are used by designers, and if so — how do you notice it?</blockquote>
I guess 'What The Font' helps. I wonder how many hits they get of people wanting to find out which font Dell use, and how many of these go on to purchase Museo.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Dave, great response, very interesting!</p>
<p>Fonts are a bit like fashion, it seems, so things that were the thing 10-20-30-40 years ago might well be the thing now again. It makes sense to me though, as families like Amasis might suit the market for slabs, that seems to be booming, and by discounting it, it is brought under the attention of many again.</p>
<p>I wonder if there might not be a useful market mechanism in this? Perhaps fonts can be expansive when they are new, and exclusive, then get cheaper over time? In a quite saturated market this might be a way to keep demand up. If fonts are unsuccesful at first the price will go down as well, which might eventually lead to a price that may be right for certain customers? Of course the very successful fonts will not need such a thing and keep the initial high price.</p>
<p>I doubt an inverted mechanism, where fonts are cheap first, then get more expensive, would work very well, as the font loses its newness and thereby its fashion appeal (if you may).</p>
<p>The most logical solution for me would be to offer modest discounts, up to a maximum of 50%, but more like 30% at the introduction. If the font does not pick up after a certain period of time, a flash sale or a short period deep discount might jump the demand. If this does not work, well&hellip;</p>
<p>Another thing that interests me is if certain font buyers are encouraged by a higher price than the standard font, say 60-100$ or more per font? It seems to be the tactic of some designers/foundries, and I wonder if this works to their advantage?</p>
