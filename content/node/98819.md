  body: "This kind of signage is typically spray painted using stencils. At the place
    I work for, we cut the entire message to save time for the road crews and to avoid
    this kind of mistake. Others use interlocking off-the-shelf stamped brass or plastic
    stencils. The letters slide or snap together \u2013 sometimes equally well upside-down,
    or backwards - or both, so you can get some interesting results from time to time.\r\n\r\nThis
    one, looks like it was made by painting the yellow strip then laying individual
    pre-cut letters down and painting over them. The spacing and kerning is not bad
    which suggests that back at the shop someone made up a spacing template for the
    road crew (typically no more than a strip of paper or some other disposable material
    with ticks for letter positioning), but then they forgot to write \u201Cthis side
    up\u201D on the letters. Not that it would have helped much. :o)\r\n\r\nWith some
    empathy for the guy who made the mistake, he was probably simultaneously over
    thinking and under thinking. Or still drunk from the previous night.\r\n\r\n@
    Herb... Hilarious!"
