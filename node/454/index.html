ID has very few flaws left while Quark more and more feels caught between the weight of old age  and the massive lack of innovative ideas. Integration, reliability, creativity, speed... ID is my first choice in Layut and even in smaller stuff I once did in Freehand. What Photoshop has become in terms of Imageediting, ID has become in terms of designing pages...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Man, I hope more people switch to ID. Although OpenType isn&#39;t the most democratic format right now, the upsides of the format are just dandy with me, text-setting hasn&#39;t been as much fun in years.  <BR>And as Adobe and URW and Lino and some other companies are making the switch to OTF and others, like House and Emigre sloooowly trying their hands at the extended possibilities of that format as well, I think Quark will either include OTF or involuntary give Adobe a marketing bonus.  <BR> <BR>Quark only survives because people are so used to it.

		<div class="commentbody">Keith, I use InDesign and Acrobat Distiller -- it&#39;s a perfect combination Exported PDF works okay &#40;better than any otheer direct-to-PDF-export, the EPS-Export is also nice&#41;, but Distiller still is the safest and most flexible way to do it. Since I work with InDesign and on Win-based workstations, I have preferred PDF for well over five years now, when most printersor film-outputters didn&#39;t even accept them. Thanks to Computer-to-plate that has changed. PDF is the best way to get your data to the outputter and InDesign&#43;Distiller is a Killer combination. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Did someone suggest that Quark 6 doesn&#39;t support OpenType? <BR>Will they in the future? <BR> <BR>_________ <BR>Related Tangent: <BR> <BR>It&#39;s very interesting to track Adobe versus Quark and  <BR>Macromedia. <BR> <BR>It seems pretty clear from Macromedia&#39;s moves in the last  <BR>year &#40;buying Cold Fusion, launching MX, pushing Flash to a <BR>much richer, application development tool&#41; that they&#39;re  <BR>much more interested in creating apps for the development  <BR>of enterprise-level web sites. It&#39;s a smart move for <BR>Macromedia, but it&#39;s just interesting to see it happen. I  <BR>wonder if Freehand will eventually go the way of XRes and  <BR>Fontographer. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s Quark. They have a huge foothold in the <BR>publishing industry &#40;not just graphic design&#41;. They&#39;ve taken  <BR>XML and run with it. Maybe ID can do that too - I&#39;m not  <BR>sure - but I can&#39;t see these old, giant companies switching  <BR>to ID as easily as an agency or a design firm or even a  <BR>school could.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I finally downloaded a trial copy of inDesign a couple of months back and I&#39;ve never opened quark since. Aside from being vastly more intuitive than quark, the type setting and style sheet features are top notch. Also, no more bitmapped fonts. Precise letterspacing and kerning were impossible on screen in Quark because of the terrible display of most T1 fonts. ID does a much better job. Finally, the collect for output features of ID are a thousand times better than Quark, though perhaps a topic of disagreement among type designers. ID actually collects your fonts upon your request. &#40;You do get a dialog box warning you that you may be in violation of copyright by doing so&#41; And if you don&#39;t want to send your fonts, you can convert them to outlines. Another ID only feature. <BR> <BR>Needless to say, I&#39;m sold. I hate to see the market dominated by a goliath such as adobe, but as long as quark keeps developing such an inferior product, adobe it shall be.</div>

Quark let me down over 5 or 6 years ago and I&#39;ve been forced to use them because of their stranglehold on the industry, but Adobe InDesign has given me a taste of freedom, and have given page layout the overhaul that Quark has needed since the late 90&#39;s. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still learning the finer points of InDesign, but nothing will distract me from it.

		<div class="commentbody">The downside of the file restauration management of ID &#40;which, at least partially was already one of the nicer features of Pagemaker&#41; is that whenever I work in Quark or Freehand I forget that THEY DO NOT HAVE something along those lines. So you experiment more, save less often inbetween, and when it crashes, it&#39;s gone for good. No prob with ID, but on Freehand you have no chance of retrieving your designs. FH, even in the MX version, sucks compared to Indesign.  <BR>Photoshop could use somthing like this as well, especially as they DO save intermediary files on your harddisk, so restoring them after a crash should be rrrrrelatively simple to program. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;ve been a staunch supporter of Quark for  <BR>years. Even through this whole ID verses  <BR>Quark debacle I have heard myself saying <BR> many times &#34;I&#39;ll never leave Quark it is so <BR>great&#34;. In truth, it has been great to me with  <BR>few complaints. Most of my work in the past  <BR>has been for magazines, annual reports and <BR> long brochure design and production. Quark  <BR>has served me well throughout. <BR> <BR>At work, I am currently using Quark 5 and OS <BR> 9.2. At home, within the last few weeks I have <BR> moved one of my machines over  to OSX and ID.  <BR> <BR>Lord, I have seen the light. <BR> <BR>While I am still transitioning into ID &#40;and OS X <BR> for that matter&#41; I am really, and I mean really, <BR> impressed. There are so many more options in ID.  <BR>I will never go back and work is like  <BR>going back in time. <BR> <BR>Quark, I guess it was just one of those <BR> things... one of those crazy flings... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll never go to 6.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&#62; You can do everything in Indesign.</i> <BR> <BR>While I am a fierce advocate of InDesign and use  <BR>it since the infamous version 1.0, I must disagree  <BR>on one point: it cannot do <i>everything</i> Quark does.  <BR> <BR>At my job, we often design low budget stuff in two  <BR>Pantone spot colors. While Quark can mix those  <BR>colors, provide satisfying screen preview and output  <BR>those files on film perfectly, InDesign doesn&#39;t know  <BR>how to handle this, to my disappointment. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m pretty sure people can come up with some more  <BR>advantages of QuarkXPress over InDesign. I actually  <BR>had a hilarious time reading a magazine review where  <BR>the author went as far as extolling the &#34;Straight Line  <BR>Tool&#34; which draws only horizontal or vertical lines  <BR>&#40;as opposed to holding down the friggin&#39; &#39;shift&#39; key&#41;  <BR>as an advantage of Quark. It all sounded a bit sad. <BR> <BR>This being said, I do all my page lay-outs in Indesign,  <BR>from simple one-page things to multi-chaptered indexed  <BR>catalogues with tables of contents and all the trimmings. <BR>No way am I going to support this overpriced dinosaur  <BR>of a program.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, that is one big minus. Although I mostly found workarounds with mixing Cyan and Magenta or something and using those channels for the seperations, it would be nice to have fully mixable Pantone spot colours with accurate screen preview.  <BR> <BR>I also wish that they would include some option to change the size of indivudal spaces, at least the pagewidth -- that would be good for fold-up-pages and Leporellos. ALso, it would be nice to have an option that makes the table borders and cells visible even if you do not have an outline &#40;and the handling of adding outlines to the cells could be a bit easier, imo&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The shift key thing I&#39;m used to from FH, so that never bothered me at all. I also took the time to synchronize my keyboard shortcuts in FH/Shop/ID, which makes life THAT much easier afterwards.  <BR>:-D. </div>
