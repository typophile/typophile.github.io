  body: Arguably one of the more recognizable typefaces of all time. Nobody else uses
    it because Marlboro owns it. Who else would touch it unless they're panning/mocking
    Marlboro?

  body: It is Neo Contact! Erik Spiekermann says so in the Helvetica movie, too. Or
    at least he says that he has it and you can buy it. That's because it is in the
    FontShop store as well.

  body: "I don't mean to overstep my bounds, because I am by all rites a noob here.
    However, I worked in a production studio basically owned/operated by the ad agency
    responsible for Marlboro Racing, Outdoor, Print and the like. I was always under
    the impression that the font was custom made for Marlboro. The names of the fonts
    are: Marlboro and Marlboro CBC Display.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marlboro_4609.jpg]"

  body: "Neo Contact is an old ATF face, from at least the 1950s. It existed before
    digital type, and Marlboro must have used it before digital type, too. I suspect
    that Marlboro's fonts are branded, i.e., they are Neo Contact with minimal changes,
    different interletter spacing, especially for size considerations, etc, and above
    all, a name change. This make people feel better when they are using the font.
    But its the same face\u2026 everyone and their parents may not be able to get
    a hold of the fonts with \"Marlboro\" in their names, but for 20-odd bucks, they
    can get as close as branding guidelines'll allow."

  body: For example the same goes for Volvo. The corporate faces are called Volvo
    Sans and Volvo Serif, but they are identical renamed versions of Akzidenz-Grotesk
    and Berling (the digitizations that originally were commercialized by Adobe).

    city levied fines for smoking in the building so those who did, could. One of
    those nice perks. I can still remember walking into work looking across the studio
    and seeing plumes of smoke rising from artists' desks.\r\n\r\nDan and Yves, thank
    you very much for the insight. I am always amazed and humbled at the amount of
    information one can find here!\r\n\r\nI'm going out and rebranding my Chevy Celebrity
    into a Volvo right now! ;)\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
