    about all those other people who have been coming to Europe from adjacent areas

    \r\n\r\nI suspect the reason you find this to be strange is that indeed the English
    language hasn't had a spelling reform in a long time, because it doesn't seem
    to need it. English spelling almost couldn't be easier. This is not the case for
    languages like German and Dutch, which I would argue are a lot more sophisticated,
    rich in content but also at times unnecessarily complex. The last Dutch reform
    was in 2006. The last German one as well I think. In InDesign you can set the
    language of your text to Dutch: 2005 Reform (I'm not sure why it says 2005), Dutch:
    Old Rules and for German the following:\r\nGerman: 1996 Reform\r\nGerman: 2006
    Reform\r\nGerman: Old Rules\r\nGerman: Swiss\r\nGerman: Swiss 2006 Reform\r\n\r\nWhat

    makes the color more uneven. I suppose it could be due to the font as well, but
    it's a bit obtrusive. In that sense the new ortography seems better. On the other
    hand, I'm not sure if the ortography is an improvement when it comes to word spacing;
    there are more and bigger gaps in the new ortography. In conclusion, I think both
    have their merit. I think I would feel very nostalgic towards the old system though.

    were very good reasons for the reform. I have no insight into Russian so all I
    can judge is the design aspect. It's rather unexpected that a spelling reform
    has such severe implications for the texture and color of the text.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I'm
    unable to decide whether you're being serious or facetious.</blockquote>\r\nI'm
    serious. I've always scored 9s for English and 6s for Dutch even though I am Dutch.
    Dutch spelling is complex as there are so many exceptions to the rules. I must
    say though, I couldn't conclusively say whether English grammar really is easier,
    but it is to me. The fact that I consistently score higher at English than at
    Dutch is rather telling.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>English spelling is easily one of
    the most irregular of the European languages.</blockquote>\r\nPerhaps so. It's
    strange to me that native English speakers tend to make a lot of errors (like
    mixing up \"their\" with \"they are\" and \"its\" with \"it's\") I couldn't dream
    of making. Obviously my English isn't flawless, but I do think it's an incredibly
    easy language. I learned Dutch, English, German and French and English is by far
    the easiest\u2014to me.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Also, what are your arguments for German
    and Dutch being more sophisticated and richer in content than English?</blockquote>\r\nI
    often find there are more ways to describe something in Dutch and apply subtle
    nuances than what is possible in English. In Dutch it seems it's more important
    HOW you say something than it is in English. In Dutch it's easier to sound sophisticated
    using certain flavors of words which are not present in English.\r\n\r\nThe reason
    I feel German is probably richer than English is because Immanuel Kant's work
    just doesn't translate well to English. I've been told if I want to read Kant,
    I better read it in Dutch or preferably in German, because since English is less
    nuanced it's more difficult to understand an already difficult to grasp work of
    literature.\r\n\r\nI believe in Russian there is a word which means \"I love you,
    but I hate you in this moment\". This is just to show that there are languages
    that are very nuanced, having different flavors of words to mean the same thing
    or words which take whole sentences to describe in other languages. This is not
    to illustrate the English language is poor when it comes to nuances, but just
    to show each language probably has nuances in different areas.\r\n\r\nI believe
    there are some stories going around that in fact English has the biggest vocabulary
    as it has so many influences. I personally doubt this to be the case. The Dutch
    tend to borrow more words from French, English and German than English does from
    other languages.\r\n\r\nThis quote I also found interesting: \"I know that the
    structure of the language [Chinese] is such that morphemes and words tend to flow
    together in a way that does not necessarily define individual words (especially
    since spaces are almost never used). Furthermore, people are always generating
    new constructs or creating acronyms.\"\r\n\r\nI think the German language has
    a tendency to combine many words to mean something different even though they're
    not defined as such in the dictionary. As such, it might very well be that English
    has a richer vocabulary but isn't as rich in its expression thereof. It might
    also be that English is very rich, but only few utilize that richness. I suppose
    it could be that the Dutch just have a tendency to utilize more of that richness,
    though based on the way people around me talk I have my doubts."

    for the sake of clarification, my references to English irregularities were regarding

    gender designations. I'm certain that you could name others. The spelling, however,
    is like a hairball choked up by a cat.\r\n\r\nI think we're all biased by our
    native languages in the sense that we easily and intuitively grasp their nuances
    in ways that might not be possible for languages learned later in life. As a native
    English speaker, I often have trouble expressing complex thoughts, but it's not
    the fault of the language so much as it is me being inarticulate.\r\n\r\nYou made
    the comment that there are subtle nuances in Dutch that make it easier to sound

    achieved by using words originally derived from Germanic and Nordic roots for

    vowel, followed by a consonant and then a silent vowel, is lengthened, but they
    are indeed pretty systematic.\r\n\r\nInstead, it is that unlike most languages,
    English refuses to change the spelling of foreign words that it borrows. In the
    case of Greek words, it uses the Latin convention for spelling them.\r\n\r\nA

    it's incidental considering the historical relation between English and Dutch,

    in nouns when the vowel is short (even though we use single vowels for short sounds

    \"dommerik\" (unintelligent person or dimwit), where we would pronounce it with
    a long /o if we were to use a single /m. What's confusing about this though is
    that there is an exception to the rule when you use the plural form, as it's \"dommeriken\"
    instead of \"dommerikken\". Then consider the word \"faillissement\" (bankruptcy),
    which has both a double /l and a double /s, yet we pronounce a long /i. Do you
    see any consistency in that? Both Dutch spelling and grammar is very difficult
    to learn for foreigners. I've often theorized that the reason English is so easy
    to me is that I'm very used to all these strange exceptions, and the Dutch language
    is rather versatile in its pronunciation. This is why it's easy for me to intuitively
    pronounce many European languages correctly whereas an English native has great
    difficulty with many pronunciations. I've had a girlfriend from Texas for some
    years and it would always amuse me when she or her family would try to pronounce
    Dutch. She just couldn't do it, even though she was half-Italian and visited her
    Italian family just about every year. She would always say Dutch sounds like gurgling
    and retching.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I think we're all biased by our native languages
    in the sense that we easily and intuitively grasp their nuances in ways that might
    not be possible for languages learned later in life.</blockquote>\r\nI think so
    too, though what's strange to me is that although I feel more restricted in English
    when it comes to nuances, when I speak Dutch I often don't remember a certain
    word while I do in English and I have to ask \"What is this English word in Dutch
    again?\", even though my Dutch vocabulary is pretty big. I've often been told
    I tend to use words which are too difficult to understand by others. But as I
    said, I'm just not impressed with the way people around me tend to talk.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>As
    a native English speaker, I often have trouble expressing complex thoughts, but
    it's not the fault of the language so much as it is me being inarticulate.</blockquote>\r\nI
    experience the same, both in Dutch and in English and it only partially has to
    do with the lack of richness of the languages. My vocabulary is just a lot smaller
    than my intellectual capacity would require, but I suppose that's inherently true
    for everyone (though I often do experience it as quite a handicap); this is partially
    the reason why we have a need for other expressions, like music, art, poetry or
    mathematics.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I don't want to derail the discussion here, but
    I've done Salvia Divinorum a few times and it has been the most awesome (though
    also most nightmarish) experience in my life; I experienced things which are just
    not possible to put into words. I made associations which just couldn't be made
    after the trip. It was then that I realized how severely restricting language
    is. Language is continually evolving and expanding, but I think we're very far
    away from being able to accurately describe reality without utilizing mathematics.
    In a sense it's strange we need a different language to compliment the lack of
    richness in an other.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I don't speak Dutch, so I can't argue
    the specifics, but I will point out that in English something akin to that is
    achieved by using words originally derived from Germanic and Nordic roots for
    everyday speech</blockquote>\r\nCould you give some examples? As far as my understanding
    of the English language goes there is indeed some sophistication to be achieved
    when utilizing older words, but I thought they were actually entirely out of fashion.
    Like, if you speak old-fashioned Dutch you may sound like an intellectual but
    when speaking old-fashioned English you just sound pretentious. Perhaps I'm just
    not familiar with this linguistic bridge between older English and modern English.
    From my experience the Dutch language has a lexical archaic aspect while the English
    language has a more literary archaic aspect.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Some languages,
    like Tibetan, have very complex rules for their spelling.</blockquote>\r\nThat's
    interesting. I didn't mean to imply that the Dutch language is one of the most
    complex though. I just wanted to make the point that English seems quite simple.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Instead,
    it is that unlike most languages, English refuses to change the spelling of foreign
    words that it borrows.</blockquote>\r\nSame goes for Dutch. We particularly enjoy
    using French words, though half of them are considered to be old-fashioned and
    do have Dutch synonyms. Might that not be the case in English? Can you think of
    examples of foreign words the English language has adapted? The only word that
    comes to my mind at the moment is schadenfreude.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The trouble
    is that getting rid of the exceptions, and making English spelling phonetic, would
    seem to English speakers to rob the language of its dignity. Like this.</blockquote>\r\nThat's
    fascinating. The sample text at the bottom strongly reminds me of Afrikaans, which
    is just bad Dutch. Although it's fun to compare Afrikaans with Dutch, I do think
    they have spoiled the Dutch language. For example, the name of the popular group
    Die Antwoord really annoys me, because the Dutch say \"het antwoord\", and \"die
    antwoord\" is something foreigners in the Netherlannds tend to say as they don't
    have a firm grasp of grammatical articles (is that really the term for it?) in
    the Dutch language. Also, Afrikaans is a lot less complex than Dutch when it comes
    to word structure, grammar and spelling. You would think that's a good thing,
    but it just seems like unintelligent Dutch to me. Here's an example:\r\nAfrikaans:
    Die geskiedenis word net in ag geneem waar dit prakties moontlik is.\r\nDutch:
    De geschiedenis wordt alleen in acht genomen waar dit praktisch mogelijk is.\r\nEnglish:
    The history is only taken into account where it's practical."

      dialects being used by the commoners. Over time, the languages merged into Middle
      and Modern English, but that merger retained nuances that gave a higher sociolinguistic
      register to those word with Norman (or French or Latin) origin.\r\n\r\nThis
      distinction has blurred over the centuries, and doesn't always hold true, but
      the linguistic nuances made possible by this duality of words are still there
      as an important part of the language.\r\n\r\nThere are several thousand often-used
      words in English with dual Romance language and Old English variants, with the
      Romance words having a higher register than their Old English counterparts.
      If a person is in a social situation where erudite and intelligent discourse
      is warranted, that person will use the Romance language-derived words, like
      <em>erudite, intelligent</em> and <em>discourse</em> instead of their less formal
      Old English counterparts, like <em>learned, smart</em> and <em>talk.</em>"

    wouldn't call Schadenfreude a word English has adopted - it's still only a German
    word which is occasionally utilized, not one that the language has borrowed.\r\n\r\nRather,
    English itself is largely made up of \"foreign\" words, that is, words that were
    not derived from Anglo-Saxon. If you took them <em>out</em> of English, what you
    would have left would not look like English any more. It might look a bit like
    Dutch (or at least Frisian).\r\n\r\nThere is the famous quote from James D. Nicoll:
    \"We don\u2019t just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages
    down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.\"
    - although that statement is a bit ahistorical, given that the biggest step in
    this process, the Norman Conquest, was rather more about French on English violence
    than about English on French violence. But because of the Norman Conquest, English,
    a Germanic language with a largely Romance vocabulary, is like Romanian, a Romance
    language with a largely Slavic vocabulary.\r\n\r\nPoul Anderson once composed
    a short piece in the kind of \"English\" that would remain without borrowed words,
    an article entitled \"Uncleftish Beholding\", which many English speakers find
    highly amusing. You may be able to find a copy on the Web through Googling, even
    though it really shouldn't be there."
