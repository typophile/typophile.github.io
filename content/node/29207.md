  body: 'They vary widely... they usually fall into 2 camps: either built by an engineer
    or ported from print faces (like Arial). Exceptions exist, of course, like the
    Nokia typeface (designed by [[Erik Spiekermann]]) or our (ahem, plug, plug, [[Punchcut]])
    font work for Qualcomm. At this stage, it''s very rare to find retail typefaces
    that are being used for mobile. In a pinch, I''d suggest you look at bitmap typefaces
    designed for desktop computer screens.'
