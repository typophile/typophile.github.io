  Most of what I have is either too formal/ornate or too grungy/handwritten. I'm looking
  for something that is authentic, somewhat formal, italian/wine label-esque but contemporary.
  \r\n\r\nAny ideas would help!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The Hipster fit is a little too brushed casual for what I need, but I like
    it. I'm ultimately looking for a font to use now, but long term would really just
    like to build my script collection so any suggestions would help. \r\n\r\nI was
    looking at something like http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=lavanderia\r\nSomething
    sort of in that vein. I like some things going on with that font, but some of
    the swash caps were a bit much. \r\n\r\n--Authentic in that it's a somewhat traditional
    script without having too much of the ornate cursive (like chopin). \r\n\r\n"
