  and serifs (Garalde, Didone, etc.) are there different kinds of scripts? I know
  the answer is yes, but I would like to hear what some broad categories would be
  labeled as (\"Brush\", \"Calligraphic\", etc.) as, clearly, there are worlds in
  between something like Mistral and Snell Roundhand.\r\n\r\nMaybe a classification
  already exists?"

  body: "@Tiffany: I really don\u2019t like the casual/formal designation. Such a
    designation is subject to both time and personal taste. For example, the casual
    sign scripts of the 1950s are now being ironically used in ways that probably
    are not casual, and one-formal spencerian/copperplate/etc. scripts have become
    popular with various aspects of the music industry, which tends to be quite casual.
    Typeface classification systems should be above such subjectivity, so I feel that
    classification based on letterform construction is a better idea."

  body: "I don't think of casual vs. formal as being so much a matter of how its used.
    Formal scripts are typically designed more uniformly and casual scripts tend more
    towards natural writing styles. No doubt you can use them in various casual or
    formal settings, but to me there is a distinction although that distinction can
    be vague in some cases. \r\n\r\nIt is harder to classify scripts, I think, because
    there is such broader range of possibilities to deal with."
