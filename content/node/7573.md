body: I&#39;m having trouble identifying what looks like a rather conventional face
  at first sight, reminiscent &#40;to me&#41; of Swift. It&#39;s on the cover of a
  cook book, so it shouldn&#39;t be anything exotic, but automatic recognition tools
  and the myfonts.com catalogue have let me down. <BR>In particular, the &#34;t&#34;
  is nothing like what I&#39;m used to seeing in serif fonts... but then, I&#39;m
  not a typographer. <BR> <BR>Many thanks, <BR>Endre <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/53078.jpg"
