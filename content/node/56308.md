body: "I\u2019m confused by the way Fontlab handles kerning classes in the OT kern
  feature. After I generate kern and select the kern feature in the OT menu no list
  of class definitions appears in the lower box. If I use \u201CImport Fontlab Classes\u201D
  the class definitions appear in the box, but when I compile the OT code I get this
  warning: \u201C[WARNING] <NSGothic1L-Ultra> Glyph class @NSGothic1L-Ultra redefined
  [/Users/jpad/Documents/design/fonts/FontLab_settings/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea
  26]\u201D\r\n\r\nI have not unchecked \u201CAdd all glyph classes to Opentype feature
  definition code\u201D. What\u2019s going on here?"
