  to have a font designed for personal use? My best friend is obsessed with fonts,
  and I was thinking that giving her her very own font would be a lovely present.
  If anyone could help me with this, I'd really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    quite expensive.

    be really expensive, but then again I really know next to nothing about typeface
    design. Would you guys know any designers who'd work for peanuts? Haha. \r\nOr
    would you be able to recommend a good book on typefaces, maybe?\r\n"

    the quality was understandably not super high. So, yeah if she is really into
    fonts in a serious way a book probably is a great way to go. Yo might find some
    ideas here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/books\r\nor\r\nhttp://www.youworkforthem.com/list.php?cat=40\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you do a site search of Typophile via google there are several threads about
    good type books."

  body: What about a student type designer? You won't get the amazing level of quality
    like folks here could produce, but it would be cheaper.

  body: I personally wouldn't even suggest having a student do that amount of work
    unless I was willing to pay several hundred dollars. (A lot of people here would
    be looking for thousands, I suspect. Heck, some foundaries charge over $100 just
    for a license. (Of course, the designer does not get all of the pie when a foundary
    is involved.)

    cost (and that's a cheap one) and let her decide what to do with the money.

  body: Another tact might be to contact an active freeware or amateur type designer
    and ask if they'd be willing to give their next font your friend's name - it wouldn't
    be exclusive but it would be kind of cool, and you will probably find someone
    willing to do it for $50
