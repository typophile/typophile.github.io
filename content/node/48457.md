body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ni've got to design a brochure about an urbanism workshop that will
  take place in China. In fact, there will be three versions: a French, an English
  and a Chinese version (combined with a bit of English text). The porblem is: I know
  NOTHING about Chinese typography. I did read the following threads but I'm just
  more confuse than I was\u2026 \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/40032\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/47267\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/19200\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/38166\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/42433\r\n\r\nSo,
  basically, can you guide me about choosing a good chinese font (I don't know yet
  if the text will be set in traditional or simplified version). I'm in the early
  stage of the design so I don't really know what I'm looking for, but as I understand
  it, I'll have to work with the font that'll work best technically with a short squedule
  (must be send to print on monday, 25!!!). A formal clue: there'll probably be some
  [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_gridnik/gridnik.html|gridnik]] or [[http://www.lineto.com|simple]]
  in the layout. \r\n\r\nIs there Chinese typographic \"rules\" that I must know?
  \r\n\r\nIs there technical issues that I should be aware of (I'm using InDesign
  Cs3 on 10.5.4)? \r\n\r\nEverything else that you judge important\u2026\r\n\r\nPlease
  remember that I'm a newbie about chinese type so if your answer could be short and
  consise, I'll appreciate! It would probably not be possible, but\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Hi Alexandre, I'm Chinese, maybe I can help you on choosing the font? Most
    Chinese fonts released by large foundries support both simplified and traditional,
    so don't worry about it. I remember some Chinese fonts that may convey the sense
    you want with gridnik. \r\nAs long as you are using a Chinese font, there shouldn't
    any problem in InDesign, plus mac has very good support for asian languages.\r\nAlso
    you might want to be careful about the leading."

    in vertical. See, I really know nothing about it.\r\nAlso if you can give me some
    names of fonts (or which aspect of the design of the font should I take a closer
    look to) and maby some references about how to deal with chinese type (in English
    or in French), I'll appreciate\u2026 "

  body: "Simplified Chinese reads exactly like English, but Traditional Chinese reads
    from top to bottom and then from right to left, therefore some punctuation in
    Traditional Chinese are different, like quotes/double quotes. You said the workshop
    will take place in China? If mainland China then Simplified, if not then Traditional.\r\nI
    can't really give you the names because they are all in Chinese and PinYin doesn't
    really make any sense. You can take a look [[http://www.font.com.cn/downlist/s_12_1.html|here]],
    or just go  [[http://www.foundertype.com.cn/agentmodel/NetEasyIndex.aspx?charset=ALL&FontUse=%D5%FD%CE%C4%D7%D6|here]],
    it's one of the most famous type foundries in China. Unfortunately I don't have
    any English articles that I know of that deal with Chinese type."

    a clip from a hong kong newspaper, set in traditional chinese but reads like you
    read english. I forgot to mention that the special way of reading (top to bottom,
    right to left) is generally used in books (for long text), but not for web. It's
    just a cultural thing...\r\nAlso there is no such thing as hyphen/hyphenation

  body: "Marica -- just curious. I don't often typeset Chinese, but it fascinates
    me.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the punctuation is that they have the same width as
    the regular characters, isn't it? Just as the monospace latin characters are.
    I also notice halfwidth characters (the Latin words and numerals), how about those?
    Should the visual 'grid' realign after these? Your image appears to be justified.
    And I noticed the first line indents precisely one square :-)\r\n\r\nI see an
    en-dash <em>and</em> -- 8th line -- a \"number one\" character. Are those different
    enough? :-)\r\n\r\nI've seen punctuation in two different styles: either left-aligned
    in the character square, or centered, as your example shows. But I can't find
    the special punctuation character you mention.\r\n\r\nA last question: Chinese
    doesn't use hyphenation, but some phrases can only be understood correctly in
    character pairs, isn't it? Does that bother anyone when reading?\r\n\r\nHope the
    storm doesn't get any worse -- I'll keep an eye on CNN for ya."

  body: "In traditional chinese, punctuation and characters share the same width,
    because this makes things easier for setting text in both ways. In simplified
    chinese, the width of punctuation varies, because it's only set in one way, and
    they are left-aligned.\r\nThere is no dash in the picture....it's \"one\". An
    em-dash is twice as long as that, and there is no en-dash.\r\nCharacter pairs...
    ;-)  There are some hilarious jokes derived from incorrectly paired characters,
    but no it doesn't really matter that much.\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert on mixing
    chinese and english together, but I usually just decide leading based on chinese
    and justify english later on. I try to avoid mixing them up mostly, because english
    words breaks up the \"rhythm\", in other words it interrupts the reading."
