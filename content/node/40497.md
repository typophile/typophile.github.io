  body: "Actually, it's with MS and Adobe - we jointly control the OpenType spec.
    I'd be the Adobe contact person, while I believe that Michelle Hill would now
    be the MS contact person.\r\n\r\nHowever, really the best way to go about it is
    simply to post your proposal or question on the OpenType mailing list. The second
    best way would be to post it here. Third best would be to email me and/or Michelle.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: ">Thanks Miguel (but why uk?)\r\n\r\nSorry to come to this late. The mailing
    list is generously maintained by Clive Bruton who is based in London. From the
    outset both MS and Adobe font folks felt that an independent list would be in
    the best interests of the standard \u2013 also results in less red tape associated
    with an MS or Adobe owned list. \r\n\r\nPosting to the list is probably the best
    method. However if you want a quick sanity check before posting publically, we\u2019re
    happy to review.\r\n"
