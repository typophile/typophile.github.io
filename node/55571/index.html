  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Has anyone here paired <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_legato_ot_2/">Legato</a> with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_avance/">Avance</a>? Seems to me like they should compliment each other well; I'd be curious to hear some experiences/opinions.

Also, would it be considered sacrilegious to use Legato (presumably the Regular) for a large (~96pt) poster headline? I've used it for text (and in a logo) so far, but it seems like a great fit here – especially since the headline should feel a bit "uncomfortable", or "unusual" (although very "quietly" so), rather than "pretty".

So if I go with Legato in the headline, I'm wondering if I should use a heavier weight of Legato for the smaller text, but I've been wondering if Avance might not be the perfect companion to Legato here; this is science/education-related, so I have a vague feeling that not having all text in a sans face might appeal to the client more. Plus, I admit I'm sorta in love with both of them!</div>

I think the question just answered itself; a second project started smelling like Avance :-) so I just tested this myself. I love it (any objections?).
(Edit: It's just a quick screenshot from InDesign, so please forgive the patchiness.)

That's what I assumed, which is why I asked if it would be considered a bad idea to use it for a headline.
But come to think of it, I might try reversing the two in this application!

I used Legato for text very recently; seemed to work very well to my eyes.
(Jan, provided this comes back from the printer OK, I can send you a copy of this booklet. If you like, just email me your ground address.)

		<div class="commentbody">Evert might not have wanted you to use Avance - by the time he made Legato he didn't like it very much. On the other hand it's pretty safe to ignore the wishes of type designers when it come to actually <em>using</em> fonts!  :-)

I personally still like Avance, and I think it can work for longish text just as good as Legato, thanks to its [half] serifs*. I've seen Legato used in two books, one of them only for titles (and that was intended as an "unsettling" book too) the other for titles and text. I think Legato looks quite nice large, so I think you should try using it exclusively for this project - it should be able to carry the whole weight by itself. The only problem is if the project is supposed to be serious (in addition to unsettling) in which case Legato might be too friendly; except that would disqualify Avance even more. If that's the case, and you want to stick with Bloemsma, try out Balance (preferably remove the trapping though).

* A serif incarnation of Legato, now <em>that</em>
would be the highest peak in the craft.

BTW, can I get a copy of the booklet too?
Please? Pretty please with diacritics on it?

		<div class="commentbody"><em>"I think the two are too similar to work together well. Legato almost seems like a sans serif version of Avance, which it isn’t at closer inspection."</em>
Jan, I've been wondering about this exact question. I'm just not sure if they really are *too* similar; I'm thinking it may work well if I pull them apart somewhat (literally/distance-wise as well as in terms of size contrast, and maybe weight contrast)…
I'm never sure about pairing fonts – I've found I tend to pick out different combinations than other designers I know. I think some designs can benefit from the fonts being just a tiny bit bitchy with one another. And sometimes you want total harmony. But to be honest, I often think that ends up being more boring than it'd need to be.
Last night I tried pairing Patria with Avance (not at poster sizes though!). That felt highly volatile. But quite interesting. Although I can't help but feel any "proper" (established) designer would probably whack me in the head for that.

Hrant, do you know why Bloemsma ended up disliking Avance? Is it because it's more "traditional" than Legato? I'd love to read more on that.

<em>"The only problem is if the project is supposed to be serious (in addition to unsettling) in which case Legato might be too friendly"</em>
Exactly! I tried using Legato for the whole thing, and it started looking a weird mixture of slightly off-beat and strange, and quite amiable. And the poster is for a multi-disciplinary university conference on symbolism and aesthetics of sacrificial rituals (maybe I'm overstating the strangeness of that, but it doesn't feel like Legato in text to me).
FF Balance looks quite interesting too! And it does seem to look a bit less "friendly" – although also more "normal" (= less strange). And I think I'm not a big fan of the "g" (see I'm rationalizing not being able to licence another font right away :-] ).

<em>"BTW, can I get a copy of the booklet too?"</em>
Yes you can, Hrant. This is the one with Sangue on the cover (and a thank-you to Typophile in the colophon btw). But it's still going to take a few weeks until I get them.</div>

I don't remember if he said anything specific. It was probably the case of a highly intellectual designer becoming dissatisfied with a previous design philosophy, especially since he was making large ideological strides.

I remember when he cagily showed me previews of Avance in 1999, he said that he didn't like stroke contrast - he couldn't understand why it was helpful. But in Legato it's central. He was the sort of designer who needed to rationalize his choice, not merely mimic precedent - a Designer with a capital D.

Fix it!

		<div class="commentbody">Getting back for a brief recap: I found that the Legato & Avance pairing seemed to work OK in principle, at least as long as there's enough distance and size/weight contrast between them. 

But, Hrant, you were spot on in that they both seem very friendly &ndash; too much so in this case. The Legato headline seemed to call for something much more sharp, serious & stable in the small (10pt) text. So here's my surprise pairing of the week: Legato & Patria! Frankly, I didn't expect this to work, but I'm very happy with it. Client loves it too. This is going to print on Monday.
