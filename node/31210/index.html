  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey, I'm a complete newbie to typophile, so bear with me.
I have completed a design education recently 
(not graphic, but industrial, so I'm not going to claim that I am a graphic designer)

anyways, my family has a dairy farm, and thus as typical, a sign stands at the end of the lane with the farm name etc.

the sign was old, needing a repaint (at the bare minimum)i of course volunteered to give it something of a freshen up

posted first is the sign before hand (very typical or cliché for the scenario)

so i felt like giving it a change, giving the farm something of a brand identity kinda thing,

i searched the net for some inspiration, and posted is a pic for a horse farm that i kinda used as the basis for the design
thus comes the design i came up with and the after picture of the sign

please critique or comment as you see fit

thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">ok, adding to this, the graphic that i made up, based on pictures of 'show cows', where part of the ideal is to have the straight as a ruler back or 'top-line', so just a bit on the reasoning of the graphic</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Alright, I know that this was a string of posts, back to back, but this is the end of the story, or where things stand currently.

A few months ago, in an instance of local mailbox bashings, the sign was also destroyed (plywood construction defeated with drunken force and golf clubs).

Anyways, so now the sign frame stands empty, and my family wanting a new sign.  Of course it would be nice to make something a little bit more vandalism proof.  Anyways, I see this as an opportunity for a complete revamp on the sign, change up the framing/format and everything, meaning that the orientation and layout of the whole kinda graphic could change.

So this is where I would really appreciate feedback on what I have posted thus far, in terms of orientation/layout for how you feel that this might be successful.

-go feedback!!-

thanks</div>

I would review your design based on what the industry is doing. Your design is light and airy like a boutique selling clothing but is that the image you want to present to your target audience. Do they want arty design or bold, productive, safe qualities. Its not a bad design but maybe not the right one for your industry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the input Dan, I can see what you mean on the font. (I assume you meant the font was "light and airy like a boutique..."

(hopefully the graphic was good)

anyways, so thinking about the target audience, its not the finished product (milk) we are selling, its really more of the farm image kinda thing, (versus other farms), with animal genetics and pedigree being part of the image, the past year, we had many farm tours in to look at a few animals that were drawing attention, (bus tours, people from Australia, Germany, Denmark, U.S., as well as some from other regions of Canada.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Trajan is far from the right type, but that particular setup, with the tight leading bringing the word "Holsteins" off of the cow's back, helps with the balance. Right now the composition is far too heavy on the right. In other words, if you set this logo down on the ground, everything would tip over and fall back on the cow's hindquarters. Perhaps if the apex/fulcrum of the tail curled up rather than dow, or if the type set in some way to bring physical weight back over to the left. </div>

In terms of the 'layout', well, the placement of the text and everything of course in these samples isn't really considered too much, at this stage I was still really playing around trying to find the font that worked best, and as per the logo critiques, I'm going to try tweaking it a bit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, since the old one was destroyed, we are going to have the new one done with vinyl cut letters on a white acrylic board, hopefully helping it last longer and not having to worry about repainting.
Also, since, the farm no longer has exclusively Holstein cows, but now Brown Swiss too, so I have been told that the sign should only read the farm name: Wellsfarm

This reduction from “Wellsfarm Holsteins” to “Wellsfarm” has left me not sure how I feel about the balance of the look, so help and ideas are welcome.
Also, since the sign is going to be done on a white acrylic board, I think colour matching to the frame and posts might be difficult, so I’m thinking that they would be better in black, and would help to punch the sign out better.
Thoughts???

Based on earlier critiques, I have ‘beefed’ ah ha ha… up the logo a bit, and my preference of fonts has lead me to go with “Lilith Regular” (from daFont), which someone said is a ripoff of Koch Antiqua.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The back of the cow this way IS intentional, within the dairy industry, where cow "type" is pushed, a level (like a ruler) back is pushed as ideal, regardless of how unrealistic this might seem. I did use a picture of a 'show cow' for guidelines when doing the logo, I think I actually used a picture for an underlay to get it going.  I believe that I might have actually shortened the back to make it fit better with the sign.

This link shows an example of what you see typically in photographed show cows. So there you can see, flat back, and long proportions lend to the 'Dairy' character of the cow.</div>

I have to agree with the others...the type and the illustration are way to thin for signage applications. If the sign needs to be functional (ie, easily read from the road) then consider using a beefier face. </div>

Anyways, since no-one seems to be a fan of the font there, (and I am growing less fond of it), time for some new ones.
I think I've pretty much decided that a nice simple serif font would suit the application the best, in my mind at least. Gives the look of something well established I think.
Anyways, here are some ideas (no names just lettered), and I know  that they are not perfectly aligned right now, I am still trying to figure out what font suits best.
