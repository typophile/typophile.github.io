  body: 'From Myfonts: <BR> <BR>ITC Berkeley Old Style is based on the California
    Old Style of Frederic Goudy, which he designed in  <BR>1940 for the University
    Press. Monotype released this font in 1956 under the name Californian and Tony
    Stan &#40;1917-1988&#41; designed the ITC version, Berkeley. This clear, legible
    font gives text a  <BR>classic, elegant look. <BR> <BR>From FB: <BR> <BR>In 1958,
    Lanston issued it as Californian. Carol Twombly digitized the roman 30 years later
    for California &#40;magazine&#41;; David Berlow revised it for Font Bureau with
    italic and small caps; Jane Patterson designed the bold. In 1999, assisted by
    Richard Lipton &amp; Jill Pichotta, Berlow designed the black and the text and
    display series'
