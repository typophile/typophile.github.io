    to Alan Meeks's Tarragon for Letraset 1981  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TarragonInUse1_6365.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TarragonInUse2_5733.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TarragonInUse3_5003.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TarragonInUse4_4479.jpg]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/tarragon/\r\nYour
    version is stretched in width and the most noticeable differences are that _M_
    and _D_ look more archaic.\r\nDon"
