  body: "My typography teacher would say: \"don't hurt the type\" meaning not to stretch
    the type, and people did throughout my entire college course.\r\n\r\nI would have
    to say things that 9/10 times don't work for beginners are:\r\n\r\n<strong>Modifying
    glyphs</strong> for logos, unless you can really get inside of the typeface and
    work it from the inside-out\r\n\r\n<strong>Stretching type</strong>, it always
    looks...stretched.  Much better to invest in condensed or extended weights\r\n\r\n<strong>Type
    on a busy background</strong> or a background without adequate contrast make it
    illegible.  Happens way way too much\r\n\r\n<strong>Using Novelty Fonts in the
    wrong context</strong> can lead to disaster.  Comic Sans and Papyrus are the easiest
    targets, but I think I will slaughter whoever typesets something in <em>Bleeding
    Cowboys</em> or another <em>DaFont.com special</em> next.\r\n\r\n<strong>Script
    Fonts</strong> don't replace real script.  It's <em>so</em> hard to set script
    fonts convincingly or even decently unless you invest in a professional font family
    with plenty of alternate characters and swashes.  And then it takes a preposterous
    amount of time to tweak and finesse the words individually. And then you still
    run the risk of it being hard to read, or virtually illegible to a non-english
    speaker who may not have extensive recognition capability of hand-written latin
    characters.\r\n\r\n<strong>Reversed type</strong> with poorly sized coloured boxes
    behind them.  As I understand it we value the top half of a letterform more then
    the bottom, so anything that would diminish the recognition of the top of a character
    would diminish the legibility of that character.  If you're going to put a box
    behind it and make it white, make sure you have enough of a box so it's still
    readable.\r\n\r\n<strong>FULL CAPS</strong> are always the wrong answer. Small
    caps are like a beautiful little kitten when handled well, full caps are like
    a dog who has chased a muskrat through a ditch and then wants to cuddle with you.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>creative</em>
    punctuation</strong> or lack of it see if you enjoy reading this sentence but
    guess what its not just one I actually ran a bunch of sentences together here
    I am so avantgarde or whatever because I dont use periods\r\n\r\nYou're not going
    to change the world or appear creative and 'cool' because you ignored all normal
    conventions for writing english (or whatever you may be writing), no, you'll look
    like a fool.\r\n\r\n<strong>Using hyphens everywhere</strong> looks bad.  There
    are times for en-dashes \u2013, and em-dashes \u2014, and hypens -; learn their
    proper context and don't just use the hyphen for everything.\r\n\r\n<strong>Not
    using ligatures</strong> makes your work worth less than the paper it's printed
    on.\r\n\r\n<strong>U sing Microsoft W ord or P owerP oint F or Anything</strong>
    leads to horrible kerning and it's no acceptable for presentations, resumes, or
    pretty much anything other than draft versions or spellchecking work.  If you
    need to do a presentation, I think every designer has the tools to make a PDF,
    and you can kern your letters like a real man/woman!  I hate seeing people who
    <em>ought</em> to have type sensitivity (like my typography teacher) using powerpoint
    and think it's okay because that's just the standard of quality powerpoint does.
    \ Dont' settle for inferiour product, because you're lowering your standards,
    and then other lower their respect of you to those same standards.\r\n\r\nThere's
    my little rant about the type-related sins that make me annoyed.  It's hard sitting
    in a room full of 40 designers and being one of maybe 5 who actually care enough
    about typography to open up a glyphs palette, or figure out what these <em>Small
    Caps</em> things are.  Type is communication, and improper type is improper communication."
