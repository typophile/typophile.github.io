body: "Hi,\r\nI'm new here. And this is my first try at creating a text type. I really
  appreciate some help.\r\n\r\nThis is what i got now, a single weight version with
  almost all characters I need.\r\n\r\nThe concept:\r\nminim\xE1lst\xEDle CE is a
  typeface designed to replace Helvetica in certain situations.\r\nI like Helvetica
  and Eurostile a lot, so these and my handwriting were the foundations for my design
  process. I always tried to optimize my handwriting, less lines if possible, no 180\xB0
  turn backs, just easy curves. The result was the single line b, d, n, p, q, and
  r. I love the squareness of Eurostile and it even makes it easier to chop off the
  \"unnecessary\" parts. I observed Helvetica, because its still the best designed
  typeface. The horizontal cutting is one of my favorite features, so I decided to
  design my font the same way.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minimalstileCE3_3774.jpg]"

  body: Well, minimalistic it is. But distinguishing uppercase I from 1 or lowercase
    l seems problematic to me. And the descender of lowercase g seems slightly unbalanced.
    Same goes for lowercase s, I guess. But I'm not an expert, so maybe it's just
    me. Possibly you should wait for real professionals to provide more constructive
    critique.

  body: It looks well-conceived. Some of the curves appear to need some attention
    for weight; for instance, n, f, and 6 have heavy lumps in the upper left, and
    a is rather light on the very bottom. It's hard to judge easily just by looking
    at the raster image, of course.

  body: "I'm very new to world of type, but I too love Helvetica, Eurostile, and minimalism
    in general. I feel that you have a great concept and I'd be tempted to try this
    font out in place of Helvetica. Like I said before I'm new to type design, but
    I find your work here to be very strong and would like to see it in the outside
    world. Keep it up.\r\n "

  body: 'Personal opinion: the second version would make a wonderful display face
    itself, so IMHO you should develop these ''more-minimalistic'' features to the
    full set of glyphs. It does not solve the insignificant problems in the original,
    but takes quite different - and way more interesting - direction. And do not take
    semi-amateur comments (like mine) that seriously; the last word on the design
    should be yours - and yours alone.'

    text version is in .ttf format now. its not public, but i can send it if someone
    would like to test it. has full CE character set plus some more, kerning is not
    finished and there are some other little things to polish.\r\nbut anyway its working!
    so just drop me a line and i send the font!\r\n\r\nhere are some recent tests:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mil3n/2998573758/\r\nand\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mil3n/2986059130/"

  body: i have a somewhat kerned basic .ttf of this but never really finished it.
    maybe sometime... if i have time and interest i make a family out of this, cos
    i still like it. learned a lot during the last year so i gonna redesign some glyphs
    too.

    font, the second one as a display.
