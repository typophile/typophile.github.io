  towards branding a local museum. \r\n\r\nWhen creating an identity for a gallery
  or museum what are some things that I should consider for the direction of the branding?
  I guess I am just struggling with the branding process and where to start when I
  really do not have anything to go off of. The goal is to create a strong, transparent
  identity that is open to the vast styles of art that is show in the museum."

    or director, or something about the neighbourhood or region. Then keep your execution
    low key.

  body: "The first step in any identity project is to research your client. Learn
    as much as you can about the museum. This includes their history, their collection,
    their current marketing plan, their future goals, etc.  Normally this would include
    having some long discussions with the museum's managers, but if this is just a
    student exercise then you'll need to gather this info mostly on your own; perhaps
    taking educated guesses in some cases.\r\n\r\nAlso, what is the public's perception
    of the museum? Google for some reviews and articles about them.\r\n\r\nYou also
    might want to research logos that other museums use, both for inspiration and
    also to avoid accidentally duplicating what someone else has done. You especially
    want to research the local \"competition\"; check out the websites of other museums
    in your area.\r\n\r\nOnce you've gathered and digested all that info, you're ready
    to start working on designs. \r\n\r\n\r\n> The goal is to create a strong, transparent

    think part of the reason you're struggling is that this is a very vague statement.
    Many museums could say the same thing about themselves. Hopefully after doing
    your research you'll be able to develop a much clearer picture of what makes the
    museum unique. As Nick said, maybe it's just the shape of the building, or a reference
    to their neighborhood or mission, etc.  Or maybe it's a visual reference to their
    history or collection. Maybe it somehow communicates the feeling you get when
    you visit. Your research should help define what you're trying to communicate
    and ways to do it."
