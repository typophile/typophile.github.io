  body: I think many years ago it started as Cheltenham Wide, but has been revised
    and redrawn several times. Just a theory.

  body: Then again, maybe not. I&#39;ve tried digging up older versions of the Gerber
    logo and what I&#39;ve found going back to the 50s looks pretty consistent with
    the version posted. I found one in an ad from the 40s that looks quite a bit different,
    but it may not be the one they used on the jars.

  body: thanks,  <BR>clarendon is pretty close also, but both clarendon and belizo
    are missing some of the slabs and the width. But they are close enough for me
    to make some extra headline copy. Thanks for the help!!
