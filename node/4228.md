body: Hi everybody - I am new here! <BR> <BR>In fact I searching for serif font. Its
  for a magazine redesign and for long text. Should be modern but still a bit conservative,
  quiet/clean, well readable ... I think I would fancy the whiteman/Kent Lew font
  ... <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>And than I would like to show you a logo
  I did a few years ago. Its a typologo for a media solutions company. <BR> <BR>What
  do you think? <BR> <BR>Cu beck

    <BR>and try to address them here - that will help us recommend something. <BR>
    <BR>The logo: the &#34;A&#34; in &#34;BEANS&#34; is reading more like an &#34;N&#34;
    - you have to &#34;analyse&#34; the word &#40;and even the whole&#41; a lot to
    be able to read it out. I think it needs the hole. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: kind of true and I was thinking about this. I made the font only for the logo
    and not for titles or ... in the context its clear. And I decided not to break
    the rule using only the lines, with using one dot. <BR> <BR>thx for threads. <BR>
    <BR>one question - migth be stupid - if I am using a font only for layout and
    its not clear that the client will take it - do I have to buy it?
