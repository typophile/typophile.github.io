  ($1) at the local charity store.\r\nThought you might be interested in this lovely
  and meticulous (to my eyes at any rate!) piece of graphic design.\r\nI would date
  it from the early 1950s.\r\nThe \u201CDirections\u201D panel is reminiscent of Lissitzky\u2019s
  layout for <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19951\"><em>The Isms of Art</em></a>.\r\n___\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spiral_6408.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Ron Popeil:\r\n\r\n\"He got an early education in the housewares market working
    weekends in his father's Chicago factory making kitchen products. At 16, Ron began
    selling Popeil Brothers' \"Spiral Slicers\" and \"Slice-A-Way\" gadgets in street
    markets. Within a year, the teenager had moved out on his own, hawking Popeil
    Brothers' products on a flat commission basis at the Woolworth's store in downtown
    Chicago.\r\n\r\nWith his commercials, Popeil has become a pop icon. He created
    numerous catchphrases, such as \"But wait, there's more,\" \"operators are standing
    by,\" and \"set it and forget it.\" He was named by Self magazine as one of the
    25 people who have changed the way we eat. Popeil was even spoofed on the television
    show, Saturday Night Live, by actor Dan Aykroyd with an imaginary product called
    the \"Bass-O-Matic,\" which was supposed to slice and dice fish.\"\r\n\r\nAge
    16 would be 1951 since he was born in 1935.\r\n\r\nAnother source says the original
    retail price of the slicer was fifty cents."

  body: "I think neither the packaging nor the product are well designed, and certainly
    not meticulous. The typography is clumsy and weirdly inconsistent. Punctuation
    is used in some place and not in others. The dots between the list of vegetables
    are different weights, for no conceivable reason. The illustrations are labeled,
    'FIG. No. 1' etc., without any reason, since they are not referenced anywhere.\r\n\r\nBut
    all this seems minor compared to the notion that hard vegetables would be effectively
    or safely cut using a single finger to turn the blade and without any way to hold
    the vegetable in place other than with your other hand. I really don't recommend
    trying to use this device if you value your fingers. I've used spiral slicers
    with table top clamps, proper turning handles, etc. and even then they are seldom
    easy to operate. Carrots? Really?"

  body: "Don\u2019t be such a snob, John!\r\n\r\nThis is vernacular, ephemeral design,
    not the sort of thing that\u2019s in design history books, although it could be
    compared to a Sutnar catalog layout done with similarly limited means.\r\n \r\nI
    haven\x1D\u2019t tried the device yet, but my post is about the package.\r\n\r\nSure,
    the reach of the design exceeds its grasp, hence the imperfections in execution,
    but it\u2019s remarkable for how much layout and content complexity went into
    such a small package (and is nicely resolved), and that\u2019s what I enjoy about
    it\u2014and the bright, open, colorful interplay of figure and ground in a two-color
    job. Perhaps meticulous isn\u2019t quite the right word, but I was attempting
    to describe the \uFB01ne level of detail which the layout addresses, more than
    the execution per se.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the designer would have liked to have been
    able to say to the copywriter, \u201Cplease write the four paragraphs of Directions
    to be the same length,\u201D then he wouldn\u2019t have had to struggle with the
    vertical justification of different leading. But that wouldn\u2019t have been
    so readable\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd of course the angle of the A in SPIRAL isn\u2019t
    right, but that\u2019s the kind of imperfection which one cherishes in such meat-and-potatoes
    design, as opposed to the dull consistency of high-end professional slickness."

  body: I'm not a snob, Nick. If you'd posted this as 'a nice example of vernacular
    design', I wouldn't have queried your judgement. You described it as 'lovely and
    meticulous', and the latter word suggested something beyond anything I could see
    in the object. It might have virtues, but meticulousness isn't one of them. It
    has been done with remarkably little attention to detail.

  body: "Oh I don't think so. Meticulousness isn't a subjective aesthetic quality,
    something over which disagreement is to be expected; it's a word that means extremely
    careful and precise, and extremely, or even excessively, concerned with details.
    Which is precisely what I don't see evidence of in this packaging design, whatever
    its other virtues.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is one aspect of the design that I
    think is really excellent, and that is the use of the heavy border on three sides
    of the illustration and instruction panels, to indicate that they should be looked
    at together. That's smart and elegant, although it makes the labeling of the illustrations
    even more redundant."

  body: "Well, yes, that's rather my point. I suppose I have a lingering utopian modernist
    outlook, inherited from my father, that design should be a functional aid to the
    user, including revealing truth rather than 'talking up' things that are, frankly,
    a bit rubbish. BTW, the fact that this is in the original packaging rather suggests
    that no one ever used the thing, or maybe used it once and found that it didn't
    work as advertised.\r\n\r\nThe problem of a spiral vegetable cutter is an interesting
    one. Do you turn the blade, or do you turn the vegetable? How do you hold the
    vegetable in the correct position relative to the blade as it is cut? How do you
    deal with both soft vegetables such as zucchinis and hard ones such as carrots
    or yams? Do you rely on human strength or mechanical advantage? It's a significant
    engineering problem, albeit for a humble end (and seriously, how often does one
    need spiral cut vegetables?)"

    contain, since they are rarer.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a box doesn't necessarily

    slicing of the apple, leaving the core behind. It's a purely hand-driven, mechanical
    thing, a bit Rube Goldberg looking. It works like a dream if the apple is not
    too soft or misshapen. Kids go nuts over it, and I like it myself. \r\n\r\nApple
    pie, apple sauce. You need this. I don't think Ron Popiel ever sold it though.

    But with this mobile version, one could also drill through an inch of ice, catch,
    filet and scale a minnow, and then while still holding the screw, cook the minnow
    filet through the little ring with a few matches. \r\n\r\nThat'd be hard with

    Apple Pie]], which is a bakery. It blew me away that a. it looked so cool, and
    b. a commercial outfit would still find a hand cranked piece of machinery the
    best thing to use today. Why this is perfect for pies is that it cuts your time
    in half getting the apple slices, and they come out all of uniform thickness,
    so everything in the pie is finished cooking to the right amount at the same time.
    You just take the spiral sliced apple, cut it in half vertically, and you have
    perfect slices that you can fan out in the pie crust. \r\n\r\nThere have been
    5 or 6 revolutions for more efficiency in the machinery for printing and font
    production since 1840, when I think the steam-engine driven presses started to
    be used widely. But this contraption is still the best. Awesome.    \r\n\r\n"
