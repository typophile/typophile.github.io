  is an experiment with 'tape', calligraphy and rhythm. It's the first draft and some
  glyphs aren't that good, but here we go... ;-)\r\n\r\nComments, critics, ..."

  body: I'm not sure I've ever seen anything quite like it. It's almost unreadable
    (to me), but it is a unique effect.

    - try looking to ribbions for fluidity and then create an example of that with
    tape.\r\n\r\ni actually do have a jacket that has a tape styled type that looks
    so realistic people come up to me and try to peel it off! haha, oh joy!\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: The effect to me is like an irregular heartbeat on an EKG machine. I don't
    think calligraphy enters into it either. This is a 'constructed' type face. Type
    needs a purpose before it can be good. Tell us how you see this type being used.
    If you are not sure - become more sure & then keep going. Or put it down & come
    back to it.

    worth experimenting with this one. Obviously it\u2019s not the most useful font,
    but with a lot a tweaking to make it legible it would be a very, very cool font."

  body: "Thank you James. I already had discovered an arabic feeling on it, but I
    didn't know <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ogham.htm\"><strong>Ogham</strong></a>.
    It's a very interesting system... I'll look more carefully on it.\r\n\r\nThis
    is an old concept revisited - I think the first time I sketch something in this
    way was in 2003 - so, maybe it got a nice 'maturation time'.\r\n\r\nI understand
    when you said it's 'constructed', but I think it's 'constructed' only in the way
    I show it here - tape/ribbon. I'm trying to get it very fluid. Imagine it only
    with line, drawn by hand. Isn't it looks more fluid?\r\n\r\nGreat part of the
    glyphs I did with just one 'line', others I didn't found yet how to do it, but
    I think it has and interesting rhythm when composed... By the way, as I said,
    it's an experiment, and legibility isn't my priority. I'm highly interested first
    in concept, aesthetics and, of course, rhythm...\r\n\r\nMy first thought about
    the usage isn't like a font necessarily, but in 'live action', with tape over
    urban surfaces, like a mixture of typography/calligraphy, tags and graffiti. Something
    close to <a href=\"http://www.designboom.com/eng/interview/sagmeister.html\"><strong>Sagmeister</strong></a>'s
    ones, but in a more 'artistic' way...\r\n\r\nWell, I'll get some ribbons to play
    with. ;-)"

  body: If you release it you could have two fonts - one for each side of the ribbon.
    The new PDF is helpful.

  body: "I think it can be done with caps and lower case. If anyone have another way
    to do it, please let me know. :-)\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm thinking about release
    it in 2 versions -- <em>ribbon</em> and <em>sketch</em> (with a calligraphic stroke)
    -- and both with 3 variants -- <em>short</em>, <em>medium</em> and <em>long</em>
    -- so you'll be able to compose your own rhythms... ;-)"
