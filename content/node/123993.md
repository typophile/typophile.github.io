body: "Greeting font anthusiasts,\r\n\r\nI have recently finished typing up my Ph.D.
  thesis in math and I am looking to improve its overall appearance. Let me say right
  off the bat that the standard font that tex uses, i.e. Knuth's computer modern,
  is not bad; I'd simply like to explore some further options. I am using the KOMA
  script latex package which sets chapter and section headings in sans of whatever
  font family is used for the main text. While this can be changed, i.e. need not
  be sans of anything, I think I'd like to keep this feature and thus use a serif
  typeface for the main body and a sans typeface for section and chapter headings.\r\n\r\nI
  have been perusing typography books to get an idea of the field and I have to say
  that I am hooked and will probably keep on reading about typography after I am done
  with the final submission of my thesis. For now, however, I would appreciate your
  suggestions for nice serif-sans combos. The word \"nice\" is in the eye of the beholder
  of course, so what I am really asking is for your favourite or list of favourites
  combos. The main issue is the serif font that I will be using for the main body,
  so feel free to suggest only serif fonts that you like. \r\n\r\nI understand that
  good typography is purpose-driven, that is, choices of typefaces should further
  the goal of the text and a math thesis (well, any thesis) should be about the content
  itself, hence the text should read effortlessly. That doesn't mean it should be
  set in CM though, right? It does mean, however, that I probably shouldn't set it
  in Adobe Jenson, even though I like it very much. Minion (combined with Myriad)
  looks nice, but in the words of Coles, Minion is \"too vanilla\". Garamond Premier
  looks really really nice and so does MVB Verdigris.\r\n\r\nYour suggestions for
  either a combo serif+sans or simply a \"humanist serif\" would be much appreciated!"

    If you don't want to go through the process of preparing fonts for use with (La)TeX
    yourself (or perhaps having to change your workflow to some newer TeX derivate
    that accepts system fonts), see http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ for a quite a
    few examples. For my PhD thesis (not in math, but anyway) I used a combination
    of Gill Sans and MT Joanna, using fontinst and a few other things to prepare the
    fonts for pdfLaTeX, but this was a conscious choice related to the subject - although
    noone got the joke in the end\u2026 "

    way, I feel that the euler math typeface is really really ugly! I don't understand
    why so many people seem to like it. Anyway, my current favourite for serif is
    MVB Verdigris. What might be a good sans to match it? And will it work well with
    any existing math fonts?\r\n\r\nBtw, thanks for the first link."

    body: "Euler was a design by Zapf and when paired with Palatino is actually quite
      pleasant. It resembles a mathematicians' hand writing to some degree. However
      I would not consider it for any publication except for self-amusement.\r\n\r\nThere
      are a few faces combinations I use for type setting math papers. Some of them
      are old type one fonts, others are available as both type one to work with all
      major TeX engines, or opentype math font to work with LuaTeX and XeTeX using
      Unicode-math. For text font I always prefer fontspec + opentype.\r\n\r\nFor
      math fonts, the most important aspect is it's spacing, optical sizing, and accent
      placement, and weights etc. A symbol that looks out of place because of pure
      kerning or an accent looks misplaced, or a bold symbols looks imposing rather
      than merely important is catastrophic no matter how pleasing the design is.\r\n\r\n1)
      Minion Pro + Minion Math (PS, OT). Yes, too many people use Minion to the point
      that it feels boring. However, this is the only serious high quality humanist
      math font out there. The rest of the list are either technically inferior (like
      those old PS fonts) or unpleasant design-wise (like those paired with times
      (new) roman). It lacks calligraphy capitals and blackletters. I usually take
      the ones from Neo Euler (OT math version of Euler) for these.\r\n2) Palatino
      + PA math (PS). There are numerous math fonts that claims compatibility with
      the venerable Palatino. But PA math from micro-press is the only one I would
      consider to be even close to harmony when paired with Palatino. Unfortunately
      there's no face out there pair with Aldus very well, which I prefer a lot to
      Palatino for text.\r\n3) Times new roman + MathTime Pro II (PS). Again, numerous
      math fonts claim to be times-compatible. MTPro two has the best spacing/optical
      sizing so far. More recent additions are STIX and its derivative XITS. Both
      are OT. Version two of STIX has opentype math support, but there are some wired
      accent placing issues when used with LuaTeX. Probably an engine bug that's going
      to be fixed in the next release later this year. Times is the kind of face that
      has no personality at all. You can't get too wrong with it when setting a math
      document, neither can you go very far.\r\n4) Cambria Math (OT) + whatever Text
      face that matches its weight and width. It has by far the most complete set
      of symbols.  7000+ glyphs vs. 2000-4000 in most OT math fonts. It's spacing
      and optical sizing are decent. Unfortunately, it's ugly, especially when printed.
      However, when paring with a slightly darker face than Minion, or one that's
      more sturdy, I usually resort to Cambria if there's not too much math in it,"

  body: "There are a couple of oddities in Cambria Math, but it indeed has the largest
    set of math symbols I know. I use it paired with Minion, but only for those symbols.\r\n\r\nYan,
    Cambria Math's OpenType math extensions only work inside Microsoft Word. Are there
    appropriate LaTeX bindings for it as well, or do you have to use it as any 'regular'
    font (albeit with an extensive character set)?"

    Check out http://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math, by the same author of fontspec.\r\n\r\nI
    mainly use LuaTeX. At the moment there's some small spacing issues with LuaTeX
