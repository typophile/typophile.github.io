  worth the purchase, I looked through it briefly at BN, seems nice, just like a recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\nTypeface
  vs. Font\r\n\r\nI have a theory on this debate. \r\n\r\nI've come to, through my
  studies, speaking strictly in 21st century context, that what is referred to as
  a typeface is an aesthetic theory and a font is a carrier of information that references
  this aesthetic construct. Rationalized as: You can't touch a typeface. And you don't
  load 'typefaces' into the 'typeface' folder. Font is 'touchable' via mouse, you
  load 'fonts' into the 'fonts' folder,\r\n\r\nDepending on context. I get razzed
  because I say ...\"Load your fonts this way...\" I refer in all other contexts as
  type, or typefaces. Is this reasonable?\r\n\r\nThx"

    to the appearance of the letters--the way they look on a page when reproduced.
    "Font" refers to the physical carrier of the typeface--a digital file, a case
    of foundry type, a strip of film, etc.--which allows it to be reproduced.'

    you need to make a font.'

  body: Hi, Eric, regarding your first question, I have not read this book (although
    it is on my "to read" list) -- but I recently read another book by that same author,
    Alex W. White, called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581152507/qid=1144989080/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5315597-7931364?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">The
    Elements of Graphic Design</a></em>, and discovered a well-written, well-designed
    work on the use of white space as it relates to page layout, type, and other elements
    of graphic design. So I can at least recommend the author.

    Goudy book, I SWEAR it wasn't me who won it. I would have tried though, if I couldve
    gotten out of class. That was a real jem."
