  five minutes total). 39 more clips like this on the DVD.\r\n\r\nIt's a quick and
  dirty Quicktime encode, obviously the DVD version is big and beautiful. Look for
  the Nadine Chahine cameo as they work on Arabic Palatino.\r\n\r\nhttp://stream.qtv.apple.com/qtv/plexifilm/zapfextra_ref.mov\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n-Gary"

  body: We were at Linotype in Bad Homburg for the day, to dig around in their archives
    and interview Bruno Steinert and Otmar Hoefer. When we showed up, they told us,
    "Hermann Zapf happens to be here today." And we were like, "Does he want to talk
    about Helvetica?" And they said, "Not really. But he'll talk to you for 15 minutes,
    after lunch." So we didn't have that much time with him. The interview was actually
    shot on the patio of the lunch room at Linotype. It looks so lush and tropical!
    All the Linotype staff have gotten a good laugh out of that.

    this little video was a delight.

    1939?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is actually covered in many of
    his books, including his most recent one, which was co-published by the RIT-Press.
    But you can also read some elements from his biography online, particularly these
    two links \u2013\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/1494-12706/fromnuremberg.html\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/1494-12707/atthecartographicunit.html"

    what was going on.

    don't just go around implying that someone was a Nazi or whatever. That's just

  body: Note also that the NS-regime arrested Zapf's father and interned him at Dachau
    for a time in the 1930s (http://www.linotype.com/1494/theschoolyears.html). I
    suspect that his family must have had some idea of "what was going on."

    generalizations about all Germans. It's also offensive to Zapf's personal friends
    who post here. Zapf is a peacenik and has always exhibited the most humanitarian
    spirit. Consider how others might pre-judge you. \r\n\r\nYou Southerners.... \r\n"
