  body: "This is another good example of a pseudo-blackletter. It uses features of
    certain blackletter typefaces, but it simplifies and modifies letters for legibility,
    and manufacturability, and also for style. For example the 't' is not like the
    't' in almost any blackletter type I can find, but all of us see it as a clear
    't' and it keeps the baseline clean (and flat), which is also not like most blackletter
    types.\r\n\r\nThis only resembles blackletter. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Glastonbury Wide in Paul J. Lloyd's collection on typOasis is at least near-identical,
    and certainly within radar range.
