  French tabloid:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i40.tinypic.com/fdu9aq.jpg\">\r\n(more
  of it and illustrated niceness here: [[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb328281130/date1909.langEN]])\r\n\r\nBitstream's
  Century 725 comes close, maybe something like a narrower Monotype Ionic?\r\nMy main
  concerns are the word fit and overall color, I'd like to make a facsimile of these
  captions.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated!"

  body: "The loose word spacing is the result of setting justified columns without
    hyphenation. \r\nThe overall color is probably affected by ink spread, an artifact
    of the printing process. You might be able to fake this by adding a thin stroke
    to the Century type. "

  body: "This style is sometimes known as an Antique. Closely related to early Clarendons
    (narrower, not like the ones we think of today).\r\n\r\nYou can probably get close
    in look and feel with a more historic version of Clarendon, like the old <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=172327\">Monotype
    Clarendon</a>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClarendonMT_4000.png]"
