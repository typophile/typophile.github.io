  body: "I ran the compareFamily to a bunch of bought fonts as well and got similar
    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi

  body: Reading through this post about [[Vertical metrics, does not compute|vertical
    metrics]] should help. You will need to adjust the metrics of the font.

  body: "In my experience, this is simply a stupid FontLab trick. To fix it, simply
    make sure that the Ascender and Descender (as a positive number) values equal
    1,000. I am not certain, but I think that this bit of Wizard Math is one of the
    few things that DTL OTMaster actually does.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of DTL, any word on
    Kernmaster 2012? Not that it matters, but I do have a FREE upgrade coming\u2026"
