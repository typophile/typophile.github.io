body: I&#39;m just curious as to everyone&#39;s favorite type web sites out there,
  based on design. I&#39;m currently trying to rework my homepage and am looking for
  some ideas. I know that my site should be based on my own design, but I like to
  learn from the masters. One site in particiular I like is Ramiro Espinoza&#39;s.
  It has a nice colorful attitude. <a href="http://www.jazz.futurezone.com" target="_blank">http://www.jazz.futurezone.com</a>.
  I even like Beast Magazine&#39;s web site <a href="http://www.ths.nu/beast" target="_blank">www.ths.nu/beast</a>.
  Let the thread begin!
