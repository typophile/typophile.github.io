  to put it to good use and sharpen my type and lettering. I'm hoping to do a series
  of drawings of New Order song titles and crank one out every month. The first one
  up for the chopping block is \u201CFine Time.\u201D I thought this title may be
  a good way to ease my way into this project given I only have to draw five characters.
  \  \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your comments on the letterforms and maybe
  what I can do to add depth. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAce\r\n "
