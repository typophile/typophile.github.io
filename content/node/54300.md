body: "What up cousins. I am in need of your great opinions, I have a freelance graphic
  design studio based in Los Angeles, CA. I want to update my logo, but I'm stuck
  in choosing a type that will suit our icon. the type we were using before is in
  the Myriad family, but now it looks a bit soft to me, I want something a bit bolder
  but not to strong any suggestions? oh by the way the new revision i did I used Univers.
  Let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nPeace.\r\nElias Tercero"

    looked at more bold fonts like [[http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=kenteken&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=SIGHTBOX&nb_ppp=10&psize=l&classt=alpha|kenteken]]

  body: FWIW I think the mark (box + 4 corners) feels .. err .. heavy and fit more
    for a construction business or a block supply store rather than a design studio.

    for the type, I'm getting this vibe for squat, thin letterforms.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
