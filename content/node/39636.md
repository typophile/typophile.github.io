  have pushed the wrong button.\r\nIs this a Typophile or Safari \"feature\"?\r\nHow
  do I turn the damn thing off?!"

  body: 'I don''t seem to have that same problem. Maybe the words I deem questionable
    aren''t the same as you? When something is underlined for me it is because I''ve
    spelled it incorrectly. '

    it's off.\r\nBut don't they know Mac users just loathe anything remotely like
    a MS app, in this case Word?!\r\nOr is that just some old geezer affectation I
    have?"

  body: "No, that's not an old geezer affectation. I too find apps like MS Word and
    Outlook that check spelling and grammar as I type and put squiggly red lines under
    my creative spelling reforms---annoying---and I'm only middle-aged.\r\n\r\nComputers,
    software and the digital \"media revolution\" get everybody's goat at some point.
    You may old(ish) Nick, but you are a very wise man who enlightens us all.\r\n\r\nj

    checker and fires the successful shot which destroys the Death Star seconds before
    it could attack the Rebel base.
