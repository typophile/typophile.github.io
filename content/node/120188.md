  I am a professional translator and am making myself a website mostly for fun. I
  don't really expect to make any money off it, but I want to use it pretty much as
  an addendum to my curriculum and cover letter. I know the design is very bad and
  amateurish, but I would like to take it as far as it can and try to improve it a
  bit. Could you please check out the fonts I chose and give me some tips?\r\n\r\n[[http://jg-translations.com/improved.png]]\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts I used are:\r\nOpen Sans for the logo, language options, welcome text on the
  left, link descriptions on the bottom part\r\nVerdana for Services and next/previous
  buttons\r\nHelvetica for text inside the white box on the right and for the About,
  FAQ and Contact headers/links on the bottom\r\n\r\nI don't mean to offend anyone
  if it's inappropriate to ask for advice without some form of compensation. Please
  just ignore this thread and don't take it personally. I certainly don't want to
  cause an argument and apologize in advance!\r\n\r\n<strong>Bonus question:</strong>
  Sorry to abuse you guys, but globe or no globe on the logo? [[http://jg-translations.com/]]"
