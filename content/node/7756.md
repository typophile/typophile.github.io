  body: Yeah, I thought about that but I didn&#39;t think the aquarium would be able
    to get back to me quickly enough.  I&#39;m a student and I need this for a class
    tomorrow.  I figured somebody might know and be able to give me a quick answer.   I
    enlarged the sample

  body: Ooh! I think that&#39;s it! Thanks Mark!   <BR>I&#39;m gonna go do some illustrator
    alteration now.  Does anyone  know of any fonts that have an E like that?

    a bit: I went to their <a href="http://www.mbayaq.org/aa/timeline.asp" target="_blank">website</a>
    and found some other samples. Hey, did you know this was the location used for
    the aquarium in Star Trek IV?'

  body: Looks like you can make the A by stealing the left arm of a T. The E&#39;s
    Could be made by starting from a C &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/friz-quadrata/friz-quadrata/testdrive.html?s=MONTCRCY+BAY+AQUARIUM&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">like this</a>&#41; and using the right arm of a T &#40;lengthened,
    of course&#41;. It sort of looks like their E&#39;s are too light, like maybe
    the did come from another face. I think the C&#39;s from Friz would probably work
    fine, though.

  body: No I didn&#39;t, although I will admit that that was one of my favorite movies
    when I was a kid.  I liked that they saved the whales.  They also have an incredible
    display of jellyfish in blacklight tanks. Sparkly!

  body: I love the Benedictine and Benedikt is almost it, but I think I&#39;ll use
    Mark&#39;s idea of altering the C, T and A. I think the weight will work better
    than the original, thanks.

    <BR>Heather, if you&#39;re still here: A tip about using this forum. Sometimes
    &#40;a lot of times, actually&#41; it will seem like your post is not going through.
    Most of the time it actually does, but there is a bug in the code that prevents
    the original page from loading correctly. If it seems like this is happening,
    stop the browser, copy the text of your post &#40;just in case&#41; and go back
    to the original page. Usually, your new post will be there. If not, you&#39;ve
    got it on the clipboard and can try again. If you keep trying to post by hitting
    the &#34;post this message&#34; button, you will instead post multiple copies
    of your post. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a stupid and annoying problem and hopefully at
    some point it will be fixed. But in the mean time, just consider it part of the
    way Typophile works. &#40;Judging from the outage of Typophile in the last two
    days, not the only bug.&#41;'

  body: 'Oh, one other trick that works: While you&#39;re waiting for your post to
    go through, open a the original topic page in a separate browser window to see
    if your post has actually gone through. If it hasn&#39;t, go back to the other
    window and try again.'

    if you don&#39;t close the browser window that contains your post. Happens to
    me periodically.
