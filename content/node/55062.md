  broadcasts live streaming through the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease comment on the
  legibility of the design. \r\n\r\nThe client likes the direction where we're going
  with the logo. I'm just concerned with legibility.\r\n\r\nThe radio station name
  is Y101 FM.\r\n\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\nJoseph"

  body: "Yeah... it took me quite a while to figure it out. I would definitely try
    to make the \"m\" in \"fm\" more connected\u2014because for a while it looked
    like the letter i followed by a backwards n. If it's a \"rawk\" station and you
    want it to be a little broken, then the brokeness should show up in other places
    besides the first part of the m.\r\n\r\nAlso the \"upside down\" palindrome kind
    of idea is a little confusing too. Is making the 101 a separate color an option?\r\n\r\n"
