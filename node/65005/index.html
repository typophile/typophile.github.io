With the last bakery I did a logo for I was going to use <a href=http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html> Delicious,</a> because it worked - and the owner was amused by the font's fitting name. In the end, I used another one that worked even better. <a href=http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html> Fontin,</a> also by Jos Buivenga.

Before that I used Garamond for the name (Grainfields) and some hand-lettered blackletter spelling out "Das Brot" in a banner under a sheaf of wheat.

I can comprehend, why hrant has proposed Motter Corpus, but I think, you should find a font, that "matches" with the kind of bread – a German bread is very different from an US American bread or a French bread.</div>

  yes it does mean the same thing, in Spanish. The target market is the Spanish market. matching the font with Motter corpus is a good idea to match the 'baked' puffiness.
-mrMoto, I agree with the oddness
-altaira, It is not an upmarket bakery [yet], most likely I will do a redesign (does the handwritten make it seem an upmarket bakery ?

Thank you all for your help and [in my defense, i have not yet officially taken gd courses :P, I'm an architecture student but enjoy very much to do gd as well.] </div>

Then I think you need to open up your search again. It's not just the handwritten thing that looks posh, you've got it all: centered alignment, a star in gold!, classy serifed, tracked-out all-caps. And that gradient. It does look good, just potentially too high-class. – Motter Corpus is a good suggestion in terms of earthiness / puffiness I think; find a font that smells like fresh baked country bread. :-)

Also: If you have the word "Bakery" in 2 languages, you may want to set those so that the 2 words also look like they have the same function. This way it looks like "Bakery" is the "subline", but "Panaderia" looks like, dunno, the signature of the founder or something. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Or bake letters for inspiration. Maybe you can make the logo from  scratch without using an existing font. I just remember the numbers, that my mother had baked on a few of my birthdays. At least I would ask the bakery for a few of their breads. Motter Corpus is heavy and relatively cornered. It would match to bread like <strong><a href="http://ademie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/bread480.jpg">this</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://schnuppschnuess.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/19/kln_zimmermann_schwarzbrot1.jpg">this</a></strong>, but not to a light baguette.</div>

I will consider the redesign without an existing font and I'll let the shapes, colorful palettes.

The quote from the article I posted previously "The decision to develop the project into the identity for a “panadería” became obvious when the students started buying and eating bread as part of their daily routine while in Mexico."

This is also true for migrants in the area I reside. Buying bread as a daily routine is accustomed in their country of origin and when it became available [just within the last 5 years] it was evident the tradition was not lost and their routine would not have to take a plunge. The desired customers definitely love their morning [and evening] bread with hot chocolate or other traditional beverage.
The foreseen bakery is small [not fancy] but its attempt it to stand out from the other established bakeries [ a few in other townships but none in the township it will be established], but the goal is not to step over the boundary and over the customers comfort zone. The migrants are costumed to simple [decor] and anything [logo identity] that resembles their small town hand lettered signs and bright colours. The focus is not on the fancy or strange. The main goal is between the cross breed between a small coffee shop feel with a "panaderia". The more home-town feel the better while keeping it well designed.


And as I write this and see my previous design, I now think, If I was one of those customers, I would not walk in there to buy my morning [evening] bread :)

thank everyone, i will work on a redesign and post for comment.</div>
