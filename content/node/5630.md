  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>We&#39;re supposed to come up with a mark &#40;black/white&#41;
  for a travel agency specialized in time travel. The name is to be a combination
  of the letters S, T and O and it has to be set in Futura &#40;how&#39;s that for
  originality&#41;. No arbitrary design decisions, every single shape needs to be
  there for a reason. <BR> <BR>Our instructor told us to keep this quote in mind:
  &#34;A logo is a good logo if you can draw it in the sand with your toe&#34;. <BR>
  <BR>So this is what I have now, it&#39;s an hourglass with the sand flowing upwards
  &#40;as in going backwards in time&#41;: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40718.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>I wanted to keep the whole thing pretty clean and loose, so I went
  for bold shapes and emphasized the negative space.. I tried to echo the O&#39;s
  shape in the pictogram, and the lower curve is supposed to continue the flow of
  the S. I&#39;m not sure about the line weight of the two curves.. I did make them
  thicker at one point but that kind of destroyed the image of the hourglass..  <BR>
  <BR>Any suggestions?'

  body: Franz, <BR>The pictogram seems totally devorced from the letterforms.  Perhaps
    you can find a way to make your hour glass evolve from negative shapes in the
    letters?

  body: 'I would, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re allowed to modify the letter shapes..
    It&#39;s a pretty restrictive assignment. I&#39;d love to marry the pictogram
    to the type and play around with the letterforms, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re
    meant to. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Then again, I think I did attempt to combine the O and the
    hourglass in an early sketch, but that got too cluttered.. <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    the input! '

  body: I agree with Chris. If you think your assignment will allow it, I would continue
    to look for some way combine the Futura O and the pictogram. Maybe there is someway
    of superimposing the O if it can&#39;t be altered. The pictogram, btw, is a little
    complex and might be simplified.

  body: I would like to see you drawin that thin line of falling sand with your toe.
    <BR> <BR>There are lot of other symbols for time, other than the hour-glass. How
    about letting the O be the face of a watch by putting some hands on it. <BR> <BR>First
    step is to generate as many symbols for time as you can. Then choose the one that
    will work. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O

    <BR>So it should be blurry with poor contrast? <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t think of one
    logo that I could draw with my tow...let alone in sand... <BR> <BR>As for the
    assignment, break the rules if it makes for a better mark. A big part of graphic
    design is knowing when to break the rules and how to break them correctly ;o&#41;
