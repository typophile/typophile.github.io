<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello, <br> <br>I have designed this logo for my company and I'd like some feedback on it. I like some elements but not too sure how well it all hangs together. Any ideas for improvements or if people like it. <br>Thanks <br> <br>Thanks<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50168.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Find a new home for "THE". <br> <br>The general feel of the logo seems appropriate for firewood, but the execution looks dated to me</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello, <br> <br>Thanks for your views. The logo is to be used for letterheads, t-shirts, van advertising. We cut and sell firewood by the van load so we don't have packaging for each bag as such. I was going to keep the logo black and white because we are a small business just starting out and this was to try and keep costs down. Also I thought black and white is quite bold and distinctive and would be easier to see. I don't have any design background so I'm not sure if my thinking is right or not. Not sure I want to have a 70's or 80's feel to my logo though. Maybe I should I get a logo designed for me as I want the image of the company to be proffesional even though we are doing a manual job which could be traditionally seen as something that is a bit rough and ready.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"the" white knockout on the F (or overlay if you prefer) pulls too much attention and breaks up the flow. Also move "N" <br>towards "Y" this would make negative space more neutral. <br>Recut "C" so right side is straight.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It looks 70s/80s because of the heavy weight and the tight spacing. Try loosening it up a little, experiment with some lighter fonts. Also, geometric fonts like Futura can seem cold to many people... you're selling warmth, right? (I'm assuming you're selling the firewood to the consumer) I don't know about what your customers are like, but I personally think of fireplaces and wood stoves as a rustic, homey pleasure, so it would make sense to convey that in the type. Try a more traditional (i.e. centuries-old) font, or one that has some suggestion of hand-cutting, or "rough-hewn" edges. Slab-serif fonts can convey the sense of the heavy lifting that you do. <br> <br><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/albertus/mt/testdrive.html?s=FIREWOOD+COMPANY&p=48">Albertus </a> comes to mind as one appropriate font choice, if a bit obvious. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rockwell-mt-2/rockwell-extra-bold/testdrive.html?s=FIREWOOD+COMPANY&p=36">Rockwell</a> is a good slab-serif. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/fill/testdrive.html?s=firewood+company&p=48">Rosewood Fill</a> has an endearing irregular quality, although that might not be the look you're going for. <br> <br>And the logo looks very computer-drawn because the line weights are all the same. The double boxes don't help. Try a solid black square with the tree rings drawn more "naturally," and reversed out in white. <br> <br>//john</div>

<div class=commentbody>Im not sure about the logo mark; it looks like a generic logo for stereo equipment. As for the type, I can understand the boldness of it, but the san-serif, blockiness makes it hard to read. I think rockwell would also work. Try something like <a href=http://www.homedepot.com target=_blank>www.homedepot.com</a>, varying the words and working in the "the" better into the logo.</div>
