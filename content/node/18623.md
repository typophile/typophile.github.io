body: I need a new printer - my current one doesn't do it for me. I'm going to do
  some logo design work, and need a printer that shows me how my letters will look
  on print. What should I consider when buying a new printer? What resolution is required?
  And, what kind of paper should i use?

    I use paper for color laserprinters to print on because the surface is very smooth.\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: We seem to have this discussion a lot lately. My opinion is that a true PostScript
    printer is necessary if you are going to test anything typographic at smaller
    sizes. Unfortunately, PostScript printers seem exponentially more expensive that
    laster printers with PostScript emulators. But the output really shows a difference
    in the details!

  body: "I would rather have a printer without PostScript at all than one with PostScript
    emulation.  If it doesn't pretend to have PostScript, the computer (either Windows
    or Mac OS X) does all the rendering, so everything looks as it does on-screen,
    though it may print more slowly.\r\n\r\nIf it has fake PostScript, the printer
    gets a PostScript program, and whether it correctly executes and renders it is
    anyone's guess."

  body: 'Many office print devices don''t have true PCL rasterizers either. The printer
    I use for office documents is "PCL compatible". I guess your choice might depend
    on the value of what you are printing. '

  body: "Using a PostScript emulation may have downsides, e.g. HP's had and may still
    have problems with interpreting hinting. (So I proof fonts unhinted.) But I would
    not put too much emphasis on the Adobe vs emulation PS. Say, you use an Epson
    laserprinter: This does have Adobe PS, but its text image too dark -- not very
    useful either. There are many factors involved. In the end it is important that
    you can check if the design is consistent. Digital type has the disadvantage that
    the \"real\" design is imaginery, and no realization of it is \"really\" trustworthy.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "I hope you don't think I'm trying to hijack the thread, but I am in the same
    boat. My old Epson C84 has just stopped working and I'm trying to decide what
    to replace it with. I am a bit fed up with Epsons, this current one being at least
    the second in six years breaking down on me, but on the other hand, when everything
    works, they are excellent.\r\n\r\nThe local Apple Store suggested Xerox Phaser
    8500N (solid-ink printer), Xerox Phaser 6120N in Post Sript or Epson Stylus Photo
    R320 (ink-jet A4), the price order being from the most expensive to the cheapest.\r\nI
    just browsed around for reviews, and the overall feeling seemed to be to go for
    the Epson. \r\nAs suggested in some earlier thread about printers, I have used
    pdfs as a replacement of a ps driver. Seems to work ok.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It really depends on what your priorites are. Inkjet printers will usually
    provide better and more consistent color reproduction (especially for contone
    images), while laser printers will usually provide sharper and truer type. But
    regardless of what your priorities are, you'll need a true PostScript printer
    for professional work.\r\n\r\nThere are losts of great printers out there. Some
    cost less than $500. Others need to be leased for $6000/month.\r\n\r\nIf I were
    a one man shop, I would buy a cheap PostScript Black and White printer for examining
    type and an inkjet like the HP Designjet 30 with EFI RIP for color proofing."
