  body: "Regarding open source fonts for Indian scripts, the Lohit family is the only
    one that I am aware of (and I have looked around quite a lot).\r\n\r\nRegarding
    quality of design of the Lohit fonts: it seems to be consistent across all scripts.
    Regarding quantity, i'm not sure what you mean exactly, but the glyph counts of
    the fonts are not identical, but a minimal functioning set for each script is
    included in the Lohit fonts.\r\n\r\nRegarding the ability to set scriptural text,
    it depends on what the text is and if you are looking for certain characters in
    particular."
