  body: There is something fabricated about these letters. Look at the stems of the
    B and E. The S looks tipped back to the left, or inverted; the K looks compressed
    by comparison. The M could be an upside down W -- in fact your choice of Eagle
    would actually get you VERY close if you start thinking &#39;modify&#39;, &#39;thicken&#39;,
    &#39;squeeze&#39;, and &#39;flip&#39;. The W, for example, would make this M perfectly.
    The A, C and O are already exactly the right shapes, and maybe need stroke thickening.
    The J has been altered. <BR> <BR>My vote is crudely customized Eagle Bold -- just
    where you started.
