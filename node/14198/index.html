  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is David Bailey, I will be a junior at Drexel University in Philadelphia this fall, majoring in Graphic Design. The reason for this post is regarding a two term co-op experience that I will have this coming fall/winter (approx. Sept. 20th to the middle of March).  Drexel has counselors that will help us find co-ops next quarter but I&rsquo;m starting my own search to hopefully land an interesting/good co-op job for the begining of the close approaching academic year. Drexel&rsquo;s Graphic Design program focuses mainly on the print side of the buisness (logo design, branding, page layout, poster/ad design, book cover design and product packaging).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite in love with my major and the work I do every day in class and for that reason would love to find an opportunity to spend my co-op at a buisness in NYC, a main hub of design these days. My work has been praised and won awards so I&rsquo;m confident in my abilities, this is why I&rsquo;m reaching for the best jobs out there. So far I&rsquo;ve been in contact with RCA Records but I won&rsquo;t know if I have an interview for another couple weeks, which is cutting it dangerously close. I&rsquo;ve attempted contacting a few smaller firms with no response yet. I&rsquo;m about to just start calling the bigger names in the city (Poulin&amp;Morris, Pentagram, etc.) to either get a yes or no about interns because I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck without a job. I&rsquo;m quite aware of this being a Typography board but I&rsquo;m spreading the word however I can. Please respond here if you have any sort of connections or work in the cit or even have your own buisness there! (or shoot me an email through the forums!) Regarding work I&rsquo;ve done up to this point in school and on my own you can visit this link: <a href="http://www.dsinelab.net/dave/index.html">http://www.dsinelab.net/dave/index.html</a>  Best regards and thank you for taking time to read this. I&rsquo;m aware this is only my second post here, but all the people I met at TypeCon were so friendly and I&rsquo;m sure there are a plethora of designers here that might be able to help!</p>
<p>Attached are two photos of my latest work to entice some help!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">David, you will have more luck after Labor Day. What happens in the business world is the budgets have been spent by Memorial Day (in general) and a lot of decision makers go on vacation during the summer months (kids out of school). A lot of agencies actually give staff members Fridays off during the summer. The approach I think you need to take is, research your potential targets and get an e-mail or something in print that arrives just after the Labor Day weekend. Don&rsquo;t get discourged and don&rsquo;t give up.</div>

<p>Dan: Thanks for the heads up, this must be why RCA doesn&rsquo;t send samples to the Art Director till mid August to review. I&rsquo;ll call people and put them on the spot once it gets closer to Labor Day.</p>
<p>Paul: I didn&rsquo;t get to talk to any of the presenters, besides Yves (who&rsquo;s obviously not from NYC ;)) I really wanted to talk to Paula Scher about Pentagram but I was in fact a volunteer and was sitting at the door checking badges for a lot of the lectures. :-/</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Pretty much. Those big academic / professional conferences that I&rsquo;ve worked at - the American Sociological Association&rsquo;s annual meeting and, one year, MLA - realized, I think, that the goodwill and camaraderie generated by allowing friends / kids / spouses into the meetings and not insisting on some kind of badge at the door was far more valuable than the few bucks lost (I mean really, how many of those people are going to buy a badge anyway?). This happened at MLA, of course, where the registration was close to $700, and at regional Sociological association meetings with about 1000 registrants, where most folks paid about $60 registration, so I don&rsquo;t think price is the thing.</p>
<p>From what I understood from talking to those kids at the door, it was more Parsons just being very serious about security, and not a SoTA thing anyway. Besides, that&rsquo;s so not the character of the organization, but I could very much see it as being the character of the school.</p>
<p>Anyway, wayyy off topic. David, how do you feel about working for the dark side (and by that I mean advertising)? I know a coupla people who might be able to help you.</p>

<p>I have no problem working for any type of design job that will be interesting and not just making copies all day long. I feel my education at Drexel is VERY well rounded but specific enough in each area that I&rsquo;m proficient at whatever I do. I&rsquo;ve got about a month now to secure a job or else my whole reason for going here is down the drain, I could&rsquo;ve used the Drexel system but who wants to stay in Philly for a design job when there&rsquo;s NYC! (I&rsquo;m out to experience a new situation for 6 months and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing an independent search). So yes, in that many words! ;)</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;m just trying to avoid that, I know how to code HTML and CSS by hand if I HAVE to but I really don&rsquo;t like doing web design. I get very little satisfaction designing and coding webpages, they just don&rsquo;t excite me like say a magazine or a poster orrrr and ad. In the end&hellip;beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers but I don&rsquo;t know how much I&rsquo;d learn (in the direction I want to go) if I do webdesign for co-op. I completely agree though, in that many words ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, finding an internship in NYC can be as daunting as finding an empty cab on a rainy day. There are many interns from many local schools that get placed through their schools in the better firms. At Pentagram, for example, we have interns lined up for the next six months and we look for them much in advance and we usually do it through schools – also, interns are by &ldquo;team&rdquo; not as a whole, meaning that each partner is responsible for hiring their own interns, it is not an office wide initiative.</p>
<p>Other firms may be open to getting interns from independent initiatives like yours but it&rsquo;s usually easier when there is backing from a school program.</p>
<p>In the end, the best thing you can do is to call as many design firms as you can, get them to see you regardless of them having an opening or not (portfolio critiques can be extremely helpful and you will find that they will serve you better than awards or your work being praised). Try going through Workbook&rsquo;s directory, <a href="http://www.workbook.com/phonebook/">http://www.workbook.com/phonebook/</a> it&rsquo;s a great resource for all firms in Manhattan.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to do web design, don&rsquo;t take an internship where you will be asked to do web stuff. You won&rsquo;t enjoy it and your employer will not get the best from you. If you like print, find a print internship, don&rsquo;t settle for anything you are not passionate about.</p>
<p>And remember that it&rsquo;s very competitive.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, you will make lots of copies, mount many presentations and stay late working on making more copies and mounting many more presentations. Don&rsquo;t let that deter you, it&rsquo;s a very formative experience.</p>

<p>Armin:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny cause Drexel stresses how awesome their co-op program is, yet their out of Philly contacts are limited or none (only surrounding PA really and it&rsquo;s even worse for designers) I heard nothing but mediocre reactions from my classmates who are using the system, two other girls in my major who are ver skilled are working at Comcast and Aetna but I want to find a more diverse/creative company. I guess I&rsquo;m being picky but I have a vision and I&rsquo;m doing my damndest to be where I want to be (NYC) and get what I want (some sort of creative print co-op). Understood about Pentagram, I figured that they would already have a system set up. I have a list of more people I would like to contact the beginning of next week from talking with JLT and by doing my own research/talking with John Langdon.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link, I&rsquo;ll check that out&hellip;the hardest part is going to be finding a place to stay for 6 months in the city, probably by myself.</p>
<p>The competative nature doesn&rsquo;t bother me, I&rsquo;m going to talk to a few professors before I go to my interview next week and have them help me out. I&rsquo;m very confident in my work like stated in my first post, but not overly confident that I&rsquo;m not open for suggestion (after all I&rsquo;ve only been doing this for barely two years!)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking to be lead designer or anything but I&rsquo;d like to get something constructive out of this co-op, paid or not paid, I can afford to work somewhere that isn&rsquo;t paid if the time is worth it! I&rsquo;m out to learn because I love what I do and if that isn&rsquo;t good enough reason to strive for the best then I don&rsquo;t know what is! One of the seniors who just graduated got me in contact with RCA. She said her experience was awesome, she got real work to do, the people were nice to work with and she got to meet some bands, which can&rsquo;t be complained about!</p>
<p>Anyways I&rsquo;ll let everyone know how it goes at RCA. I&rsquo;m still going to be contacting other people as backup even though this job is exactly what I&rsquo;m looking for! I&rsquo;ll go bananas if I get it! :D</p>

Unsolicited post cards and small portfolios are also great. The days of the giant book drop off are gone, and for good reason.</p>

<p>Yes, e-mail is usually a good way to contact principals and creative directors – by &ldquo;call&rdquo; I meant &ldquo;contact somehow&rdquo;. I would only recommend you call first (hopefully you&rsquo;ll get a nice receptionist willing to divulge the information) to find out who to send an e-mail to. It&rsquo;s better than sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@companyx.com">info@companyx.com</a> and addressing it &ldquo;To whom it may concern&rdquo;. Once you send the e-mail, tell them you WILL call them in x days to follow up, and then call them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk to one of my professors who runs a Professional Practice class before I go on the interview so that I&rsquo;m 100% prepared but I&rsquo;d appreciate any tips you guys have! I&rsquo;ve never really gone on one before, but these are my thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have questions to ask about what the job/internship will entail.</li>
<li>Research/know information about the respective company and what they do.</li>
<li>More questions about the actual company.</li>
<li>Dress appropriately, I don&rsquo;t own a suit or anything but have heard that interviews for design jobs aren&rsquo;t as formal as some other jobs in how you should dress. I figure some nice dressy pants and a matching collared shirt with some decent shoes, not sneakers!</li>
<li>Be confident and friendly.</li>
<li>Send a thank you note for the interview after the fact.</li>

<p>Very true, I&rsquo;ve got this complex about dealing with people my age for that exact reason. A lot of my friends are older and that way I don&rsquo;t have to deal with so much drama, if that&rsquo;s a good way to describe it.</p>

<p>I guess the reason I asked if professors are ok is because I&rsquo;m looking at my resume and my only substantial job (in time period) was working at a supermarket for 4 years. I&rsquo;m currently doing work for John Langdon and have been for a couple months, I suppose I&rsquo;ll put him in there and the head of my Graphic Design program, along with a professor I&rsquo;ve had for 4 classes (all provided they agree to it).</p>
<p><em>if they say good luck — they say “no. you are not going to join our team”</em></p>
<p>hmm&hellip;thanks? i guess. I&rsquo;m going on the positive attitude towards this whole thing! Oh and no need to state that you&rsquo;re young in your signature; it&rsquo;s not your age that matters, it&rsquo;s your skill and how you carry yourself/your maturity level. :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say that you don&rsquo;t need to tell everyone you&rsquo;re young, because it doesn&rsquo;t matter! Act like an adult/professional and you&rsquo;ll get treated like an adult/professional. :) (It&rsquo;s so hard to explain things on the internet, it&rsquo;s all in good intentions on my part, from one &lsquo;young&rsquo; designer to another!)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi all, I didn&rsquo;t want to bump this quite yet but seeing as how you&rsquo;re interested! I had my interview at RCA Records in Times Square on Thursday and it went EXTREMELY well! They hadn&rsquo;t interviewed anyone else and really liked my work. They&rsquo;ll let me know this week if I got it! It was a surprisingly small office for such a large company. I interviewed with the Creative and Video Manager then there are 2 ADs, 2 Freelance Designers and interns. The woman who I interviewed with was really laid back and easy to talk to. She asked how many days I wanted to work and told me what I&rsquo;d be doing for work, 90% design and 10% administrative but that they wouldn&rsquo;t make me do anything that they wouldn&rsquo;t do. No office bitch work ;) I asked questions about what went on in the office, who handled certain tasks, how many jobs they had going at once and about the record label in general. I was told that they would give me as much work as I could handle so that&rsquo;s exciting. If this fails for some odd reason I&rsquo;ll be pursuing your help more in the next week or so!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Dave, I hope it works out for you. Media like Columbia House and RCA are nortoriously cheap, so I&rsquo;m not suprised they took you on. Places to live are either Queens or Brooklyn and you will find part time employment in retail. It will allow flexible hours. Get to know the subway system and do a lot of walking. This is a walking city.</div>
