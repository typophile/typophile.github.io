<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Similar to Joe's wildly popular "[[ http://typophile.com/node/123 | what are you listening to]] " thread, I ask:
<strong>What are your top 10 albums* of all time?</strong>
Here are mine.
1. Brian Eno - Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy
2. Bauhaus - Gotham
3. Daft Punk - Alive 2007
4. T Rex - Electric Warrior
5. Royksopp - Melody AM
6. Wire - Pink Flag
7. The Orb - Orbus Terrarum
8. Can - Soon over Babaluma
9. Japan - Assemblage
10. Sex Pistols - Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols
* Feel free to substitute Downloaded music, 8 tracks, singles, CDs or wax cylinders as you think appropriate.
Also, I would have phrased this differently except that the whole idea is so tied to the notion of the "album" in the first place that it would have seemed silly to me to phrase it any other way.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>1. Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds – “Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus”
2. Tom Waits – “Blood Money”
3. Johnny Cash – “American V: A Hundred Highways”
4. Leonard Cohen – “Dear Heather”
5. Placebo – “Meds”
6. Tom Waits – “Orphans”
7. Radiohead – “In Rainbows”
8. Pureape – “Screenplay”
9. Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds – “No More Shall We Part”
10. Ute Lemper – “Punishing Kiss”
Wow — That was hard. >'.'<</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK I might give you my own list, but being very subjective (some albums are not musically the best ever, but they are in my top 10 for a lot of other reasons), i'm wondering how interesting this is for anyone else than me... whatever:
- the beatles / abbey road
- the beatles / sergent pepper's lonely hearts club band
- the beatles / white album
- the beatles / revolver
- depeche mode / barrel of a gun
- level 42 / level 42
- john cage / in a landscape
- ryuichi sakamoto / bttb
- the funk brothers / Standing in the shadows of motown
- sean lennon / friendly fire
- the doors / la woman
- rem / monster
yes i know it makes 12. sue me :-)

<div class=commentbody>Note on The Gun Club - The Fire of Love: I mixed the first live shows of this band in LA and was friends with them. When Slash Records gave them an accounting after several years they told them they had sold 1500 copies of this record. Between that and other bands that were screwed over by Slash a class action lawsuit was filed that included The Gun Club, The Dream Syndicate and Fear amongst others. I don't know the results of the suit.

I know my top 10 would contain at least these two, but beyond this I just don't know how to choose. Part of the problem is my listening tastes are all over the map. But if this is some sort of desert island list... I'll have to think some more.

<div class=commentbody>What a fun thread. Just a note on Paul’s mention of Anthology of American Folk Music (edited by Harry Smith). This is expensive but well worth it. Much of this music is of improvised form and truly amazing.
Joni Mitchell, Blue. (Sigh) I remember wagging that home from Sound Warehouse and getting made fun of. Funny, it ended up at my girlfriend’s place. Twenty-two years later we still love it. Nina Simone’s Little Girl Blue has an interesting convergence with River in that they both weave Good King Wenceslas into the songs. Sad X-mas anyone?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know that I have exactly one set of favorites, but I've often thought that if you had to choose one album to represent 20th century American music, "Ella and Louis" would be it. All the best is there: jazz, the two greatest performers, the great "standards" of Gershwin, Porter, etc.
In rock, my favorites are Chuck Berry, Little Richard, early Elvis, Beatles and Paul Simon. The performers I have loved listening to most are Ray Charles and B.B. King, whom I have heard live whenever I could. </div>

<div class=commentbody>"Ella and Louis" is pretty classic. Great choice.
I suppose the longer you've been alive and the more wide-ranging your tastes, the harder this could be. I can't come up with a definitive Top Ten. Think of this as Ten off the Top [of my head]. They'd certainly be on any list of contenders.

John Coltrane - Giant Steps

<div class=commentbody>There are several albums mentioned above that when I read them I thought, "oh man that <i>is</i> a great album; I had forgotten about that one." I've left all those out since I clearly don't listen to them enough to remember them myself.
My list would be some arrangement of the following, depending on my mood:
Jeff Buckley - Sketches for My Sweatheart the Drunk (posthumous)
The Black Keys - Attack & Release
Rage Against the Machine - Evil Empire
Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisted
Tom Waits - Mule Variations
The Rolling Stones - Let it Bleed
311 - Don't Tread on Me
Miles Davis - Sketches of Spain
Various - Bird Up: The Charlie Parker Remix Project
MF Doom & Danger Mouse (as DangerDoom) - The Mouse and the Mask
Phish - Hoist
Incubus - Morning View
Cake - Fashion Nugget

MF Doom is sooo good. What do you think about his sending out other people to perform as himself?
I see a smattering of Eno fans, but am I wish more people could fall for Robert Wyatt.

<div class=commentbody>According to my ipod these are the most listened to, in order (note the ipod is only 1.5 years old):
1 Midlake - The Trials Of Van Occupanther
2 Sparrow House - Falls
3 Sufjan Stevens - Seven Swans
4 Sufjan Stevens - Come on Feel the Illinoise

6 Andrew Bird - Armchair Apocrypha
7 Band of Horses - Cease to Begin
8 Bonnie 'Prince' Billy - The Letting Go
9 Chad VanGaalen - Infiniheart
10 Grizzly Bear - Yellow House
Funny because I wouldn't have thought of some of those, but it doesn't seem terribly far off of my favorites from the past year and a half.
I'd like to add to the list the following:
REM - Out of Time
I'd also consider Wilco, Radiohead, M. Ward, Talking Heads, Luke Temple & Sigur Ros in my tops as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Excellent Ch - Terry Riley and Huun Huur Tuu. I saw the show from the Angelite and Huun Huur Tu album at UCLA. Really weird. The audience was full of loud college students making the ape sound. Very strange but great.
I was going to post a Huun Huur Tu LP but I couldn't make up my mind which one. I guess if I had to pick my favorite LP by them it would be "The Orphan's Lament". If you are interested in Tuvan throat singing then may I suggest "Tuva Voices from the Center of Asia" on Smithsonian Folkways. These are field recordings of the folk music that their music derives from. Really great.
If you are interested in harmonic singing in general then Corsican folk singing is very interesting. They have a tradition where the bass voice sings multiple notes.
Overall I would say that my favorite music is by the Roma people around the world. The dispossessed always seem to have the best music, perhaps because that's all they have left.
If you are interested in that then Romica Puceanu (kind of like the Amalia Rodrigues or Edith Piaf of Romania) is a great place to start.
The film Latcho Drom (which I know is avaiable on video) is the story of the Roma told through music. It starts in India and then progresses through time ending up in the jazz clubs of Europe and America. Really beautiful and a great soundtrack. The film Vengo shows the lives of Roma in Southern Spain who are involved in flamenco. Great soundtrack.

<div class=commentbody>yes, Latcho Drom is a wonderful film and soundtrack. The (opening?) scene in India with candles on the tree is one of the most
beautiful visions in cinema. Those gypsies know how to party.

<div class=commentbody>Pop music is mostly made for the wrong reasons, distributed by the wrong people, and is based on the wrong premise, that musicians should be elevated in status. In traditional communities musicians were no more important than bakers. Musical famillies served their function, as did the blacksmith.
That being said, tremendous amounts of talent have been drawn to pop music and some wonderful music has been made, yet it <cite>mostly</cite> doesn't interest me and hasn't for many years.

<div class=commentbody>I've been a fan for quite some time.
Besh o Drom eh? A Roma music fan? Man I have so much Roma music, from Asia all the way through Europe. My favorite from Hungary would probably be Taraf de Haidouks. There is a very haunting piece from them where an old man uses a special technique on the violin: he strips it of all but one horsehair and then plays the most haunting song you have every heard. Really amazing.
Here's a cool link from You Tube with their piece in Latcho Drom. There are other examples there.

I can think of a bunch. I think the idea of the "album" is a carry over from a 70's rock outlook on the world. That time has passed even if it did leave a mark.
To ask my neighbor's kid this "10 Album" question would be to make ( probably ) a very wrong assumption about how she listens to music, what it means to her, and even about how she buys ( or doesn't buy ) music.
A person who grew up with 78's or 45s might also have no real relationship to the question.
My grandfather listened only to classical & opera on his reel to reel player.
Similarly if what you like is not rock or jazz but ethnic recordings, or classical or medieval or anything outside of this recent but dying phenomena the question probably also comes across as loaded, false, or both.

Madonna "Ray of Light"
Ricky Martin "Vuelve" (although I might have chosen "Unplugged" for "Fuego de Noche...") and yes, i said Ricky Martin >^p
Bob Marley "Legend"

Grateful Dead "Old and in the Way"

Paolo Nutini "These Streets"
<em>I’m finding that as soon as I start thinking beyond pop music, which I listen to less and less often, this question becomes impossible. I wonder why that is?</em>
I think because the "album" is such a pop concept that it's hard to think of other styles of music within this framework.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here's a pretty representative 10 of my favorites, most of them older.
Dave Douglas: "Tiny Bell Trio"
Charles Mingus: "Tijuana Moods"
Duke Ellington: the Newport concert 1956
Thelonious Monk & Pee Wee Russell: the Newport concert 1963
Freddy Merkle: "Jazz Under the Dome"
Ray Charles: all the small-band instrumental Atlantic sessions
Ornette Coleman: "Tomorrow is the Question"
Gary Burton: "Genuine Tong Funeral"
Japanese accordion player Mie Miki's "French Baroque Music" CD, with works by Jean-Philippe Rameau, Franqois Couperin, Louis-Claude Daquin
Except for some wordless singing on "Tijuana Moods," there's no vocal in this list, in sharp contrast to most folks' selections here.
I found that once I began pushing words around every day (printer, designer, editor, proofreader, etc), I could no longer listen to vocal music. I have a handful of jazz recordings with singers (Annie Ross, Jimmy Rushing), but I still do not like music with words, unless the words are in a language I do not understand. Even in the most casual settings.
I know that cuts me off from lotsa good music, but I just have too many words in my head between what I do at work and what I read and the talk I hear from people. I need/prefer the abstraction of music without words.

I am with you there. I don't want to be forced to listen to my top ten in order - at all.
But what happened to me is put the Eno on and it was like an old friend. And I thought: "This really is special to me.", or something a bit like that. I was actually surprised by my reaction.
It is gratifying to see a thread take off like this. Even if it's off topic for the site. And it's also great to hear what you all are into. It will be fun to explore my fellow Typophile's favorites later. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It is odd how you can hear a recording so many times that it becomes part of your head. At some point you stop listening to it because you know it. Giant Steps, for example. The difference between listening to it and remembering it is almost the same thing—it has been loaded into the meat walkman/iPod.

<div class=commentbody>Back around college days, I used to go to sleep with a song in my head and then wake up in the morning with another track a little further along the same album playing in my head. I'm sure I just played the whole thing over and over in my mind all night long.

And the spaces between the songs no less than the songs - when you know exactly when and on what pitch each next song will start up. Once it's that ingrained, stopping play of the album between songs almost seems as jarring as stopping in the middle of a song.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>Interesting - perhaps you can “share” the recordings?
POLITICALLY CORRECT: the worship of form over content…</cite>
You bring up an interesting point. There is a collector side to it all that makes a fetish of the gear etc, which is silly. Being in the middle of life, and somewhat over it all, I tend not to question things that bring enthusiasm to life however.
Now there is also a legitimate lament over the loss of information and emotional engagement that goes hand-in-hand with increasingly lower quality playback, mastering, compression and all that. For example, I’ve been listening to the 4 Men with Beards remaster of Chairs Missing. Playback equipment aside, the level of clarity and separation in the recording on vinyl is much much better than any CD recording of the music I have ever heard. That applies to many CD recordings of music I dearly love. So my point is that it IS worship of content, and the form is secondary. I would be less interested in buying Scott Walker 3 on vinyl because the digital version is really good.
To share? Well, we don’t share our fonts, and I tend to view the music the same way. Still, I’m usually working on some level to get a good process for transferring higher quality vinyl recordings to a digital format, and view a good mix CD as a love letter that demonstrates a level of care and desire for communication that I believe is worth the effort. What I really love is the traditional playing of sides, where people sit around and have a meal together and progressively choose a side of an LP to listen to. That is a good sort of sharing, secondary to actually playing music together.
One last point. I find that the ability to sit down and become engaged with music is very important. In particular, if I am so stressed and put upon that I can’t make that connection there are probably other nuances of life I’m missing out on as well. Being a bit anti-consumer, I set out in 1997 to put together a mid-fi playback system that would be durable beyond the life expectancy of the average rack unit, not cost more than the average rack unit, and have the ability to engage me emotionally with the music in a way that would improve the day-to-day life of the house for everyone. Eleven years and 5 sets of tubes later, I have zero regrets.
Note: The above mentioned records are part of a payment/gift given to me by some musician friends in return for designing packaging. There are 30 or so recordings in all—mostly Cluster and Roedelius. I like some of them but would gladly get rid of them before I move. Being rare and worthy of preservation, finding the right home for them is a mission.</div>

Quicksilver Messenger Service's "Happy Trails" is a much better representation of their music, which really only sounded good live, and without Dino Valente.
Good to see Blues Project and Moby Grape on your list. Add the Butterfield Blues Band, and "Stand Up" by Jethro Tull and your on to something!

This is a very skewed selection of my music preferences. I have not listened to full albums of most of the tracks I listen to, such is the age of single track downloads. I very rarely listen to an entire album in the intended track order anyway. If I gave a list of my favourite tracks, favourite singles, favourite artists, or favourite performances, you would get very different pictures of my musical prefences in each of the cases. And probably get wildly different answers each time you asked.</div>

<div class=commentbody>jupiterboy - I like what my post provoked. Well said.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing.
- William Shakespeare

<div class=commentbody>Just one of a few very dedicated labels that are bringing back and cutting high quality wax. Oddly, I’ve been able to put in requests over the last several years and have seen a good number of them become available. Also tearfully received is John Cale’s Paris 1919, and the Sundazed release of Song Cycle. Check it out. <cite>As we go up we go down</cite>

You will be very pleased to see a good selection of T-Rex is on the list.

Many thanks but I’ve now got pretty much all of them on CD (mostly from obscure Japanese label Captain Trip). Hadn’t actually heard of Cluster but saw them playing live at the Paradiso in Amsterdam (as part of the 'Sonic Acts' festival) a couple of months ago and was completely blown away – one of the best concerts I’ve ever seen. There’s a short clip at
