  body: "That\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=372\">Gabriola</a>
    by John Hudson (included in Microsoft Windows 7/8 and Office 2010). The typeface
    does not have an italic cut, so they apparently slanted the upright letters. I
    would strongly advise against that."
