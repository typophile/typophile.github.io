body: "A cousin of Galette, Tertre derives its inspiration from the French signage
  tradition. It is a display typeface with a wide range of applications from signage
  to menus and pricelists, branding and packaging or publishing. It is named after
  Place du Tertre, a square located at the top of Montmartre\u2014a hill overlooking
  Paris, made famous by the artists of the 19th and 20th Century.\r\nAlternate capitals
  with Art Nouveau flavor are provided, as well as Central European, Baltic and Turkish
  language support.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tertre1_6163.png]\r\n\r\nNow
