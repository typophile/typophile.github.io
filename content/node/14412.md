  body: Stupid question. Have you tried? What errors did you receive. I've had no
    problems with older QXD files.

  body: Hmm. I confess, I'm using a mac with Indesign CS and the client sent a "Quark
    doc" with the extension .xtg. Honestly I've never seen that extension, so i'm
    only taking teheir word that it's really a Quark doc. Thanks for your help so
    far.

  body: "Hi Roger. It's been ages since I've had to deal with a QuarkXpress file.
    But IIRC an XTG file is an XPress Tagged File. What you need to look for (as Tiff
    mentioned) is a QXD file. And, although I assume you're using CS, I don't think
    InDesign 2 will open XPress 5 files. So, as Forrest metioned, it'd be helpful
    to know which versions of the software you're dealing with.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "Hmmm. Once again, I've become a Quark moron, but think XTG files have 'tags'
    that declare when paragraph & character styles change, when fonts and font styles
    change, etc. I don't think that they're something that InD understands. Which
    is why you want the QXD file.\r\n\r\nSomeone, I'm sure, will correct me if I'm
    wrong."

    4.1.
