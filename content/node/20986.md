  See below\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2880466776_4481.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  really wanted to find out exactly the main typefaces used throughout this book.
  \r\nAnd also the vendor I could purchase these typefaces from. \r\n\r\nAlso I am
  after an entire family of Helvitica in its purist form, as in closest digital version
  \r\nto the original and best family. I have \"bit and pieces\" of helvetica laying
  around but nothing \r\nin its entirety (family etc). \r\n\r\nI hope I made sense
  here. Any help would be much appreciated. "
