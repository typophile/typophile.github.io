  body: "Oh Jan, how can you say 'just Helvetica'? Haven't you seen the movie? (I'm
    only partly kidding -- the movie did give me a new respect for the typeface --
    but its use everywhere tends to make it boring.)  It does look 'cooler' with a
    black outline, though.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    even if I had, it wouldn\u2019t have changed my attitude towards Helvetica.\r\nIt\u2019s
    one of these \u2018just-\u2019 typefaces (like Times).\r\nI could call Helvetica
    all kinds of things, not even necessarily bad things.\r\nBut I\u2019d never call
    it cool - never."

    -Diddo!\r\n\r\nI actually just watched it not too long ago, it's not very long.
    It's also surprisingly informative without coming off like a high school science
    film. Decent use of music and a bit of MTV style filming make it more feature
    film than documentary. Or at least that's my opinion."
