body: "I am curious about the limits of [[fontlab]], if there are technical boundaries
  I suppose. I am working on some font projects that are super complex\u2013 I don't
  think there are any glyphs that have less than a few thousand nodes, many are 10,000+
  At this point I have about 33 glyph cells filled, but I was hoping to potentially
  do hundreds (at least the most basic roman set, but with extensive OT substitutions).
  \r\n\r\nThe problem is though that fontlab crashes when importing some of the images
  (from illustrator), but generally if I can cut down on the number of nodes it works.
  However, generating the font files never works. Fontlab crashes instantly with any
  setting. I saw at this thread http://typophile.com/node/4173 that turing off the
  compressing subroutines could help, but no luck for me.\r\n\r\nIs this simply an
  issue of too complex designs? I have already oversimplified these images more than
  I originally hoped and even if I could simplify them further, I still don't have
  as much in here as I want. Maybe there is something else going on unrelated to the
  number of nodes.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.\r\n\r\nRob"

  body: I think it would be interesting to know where the limitations lie. Sometimes
    dingbats are used like clip-art; and I've seen fonts that must be near the limit.
    Also, some "distressed" or "grunge" fonts might have lots of nodes to achieve
    a certain effect. There must be a way within Illustrator to count nodes and smooth
    things down to a point where it will work. Simon's comment is apt; there is no
    way to know a priori if a font like that is going to function for customers. Does
    anyone know if major foundries impose internal limits? If so, what would they
    be?

    OBJECTS- PATHS- SIMPLIFY\r\n\r\nThat will tell you how many points there are before
    and after \"simplifying\" and you can adjust how extreme you want the modification
    to be.\r\n\r\nThose numbers I was giving are after doing that procedure, so my
    images are indeed extremely dense. Usually I also do the optimize feature in FL
    after importing to help lower the node count a bit more because ILL and FL handle
    it differently. \r\n\r\nRob"

  body: "I remembered reading something about this somewhere and found this in Stephen
    Moye's <em>Fontographer: Type by Design</em> book (page 23):\r\n\r\n\"<strong>14.
    Avoiding long paths.</strong> Finally, avoid excessively long and/or complex paths.
    To se why, read the following passage from <em>Adobe Type 1 Font Format</em>:
    'many versions of the PostScript interpreter have an internal limit of 1500 flattened
    path elements per character; exceeding this bout results in a limitcheck error.
    Each character outline in a given font design must not exceed this limit when
    rendered.'\"\r\n\r\nA glyph with over 10,000 nodes would hit that limit rather
    quickly, I would imagine. I realize it's Type 1 fonts Moye is writing about, but
    I would think other font formats have similar limitations (particularly PostScript-flavored
    OpenType fonts)."

  body: Yes, but I don't know if there would be a direct correlation between that
    and the number of "flattened path elements". For instance, if you make an oval
    with just two nodes in a Type 1 font (possible!) or with 100 nodes, the number
    of flattened path elements would be about the same. It's the twists and turns
    that ups the number, I would think. Even so, you are probably going to have at
    least as many flattened path elements as you have nodes. (I would sure love it
    if somebody from Adobe or FontLab would jump in here with more solid info.)

  body: "I wonder if there is a reason you feel you need these complex graphics to
    be accessible as glyphs in a font? I ask because of the way fonts are used; In
    early PostScript days people played with very noisy fonts and many discovered
    upper limits on output devices. SInce then, it's very unusual to see glyphs in
    typefaces that use as many as one thousand nodes, much less multiple thousands.
    is it likely someone will be setting pages with the font you are making? I imagine
    each glyph would need to be quite large for the detail to be evident. What is
    so complex about them? Are they halftones? Maybe this is something that should
    simply exist as EPS files.  \r\n\r\nOr, as an alternative, have you considered
    making a Photofont? Since the size of the picture resources there is your only
    technical limitation, you could put any amount of detail in the images. "

  body: "My plans for this overly complex font I am preliminary calling an \"art font.\"
    It isn't consisting of letters, nor is it a traditional dingbat font. There are
    images, some have halftone-like patterns, most are simply intricate. I am not
    considering it a dingbat though because, in theory, the scales and locations of
    the glyphs would change depending on what you type. Open Type substitutions are
    highly necessary for this to work, because I want to be able to type something
    and then have the different letter combinations or entire words and sentences
    change the composition the images make. \r\n\r\nThat maybe sounds confusing. Basically,
    I want to use words and phrases to create collaged images. Conceptually though,
    it is important this this is a font, that works, and not just an EPS image.\r\n\r\nRob"

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nThe fact that it is a font that creates the image is key. In
    some cases the composition that is made would be random due to what the user would
    type, but other times there would be keyword substitutions that would in some
    ways make a predetermined image created by me. This is also, in some ways, about
    technology and the technology's role in the process. The process of me making
    the \"software,\" the software making the image, and the final output of a printed
    (or digital) picture and a font file. \r\n\r\nIn an \"art\" setting, say a gallery,
    I would like to sell the pieces as buying the rights to that phrase, therefor
    you would purchase the image and or just the font file (I don't know yet), but
    then you could recreate that exact image simply by typing the phrase. The idea
    is similar to some of the early conceptual artists like Mel Bochner. He did his
    \"measurement room\" pieces where he used tape and (helvetica I believe) number
    stickers on the walls to measure all the dimensions of a room. The only tangible
    element that he sold though were the plans and directions on how to measure the
    room\u2013 that way the buyer could recreate the piece in other spaces. \r\n\r\nRob"

    ideas similar to your idea Hrant.\r\n\r\nIt would be where each font only has
    one or a few pre determined phrase that would make an image. Either it would be
    one large one made broken up into parts like you said, or it would be smaller
    individual elements that would be arranged into a larger composition. Those concepts
    would work in some ways for me, but they fall short in the aspect that it looses
    a lot of it's \"font\" nature where there is less opportunity to make your own
    image with your own word combination. It makes it more of a puzzle that you assemble
    with only one outcome rather than legos which you can make into anything. \r\n\r\nBut,
    seeing as how a significant aspect of this project is dealing with technology,
    I am restricted by what that technology can handle. My ideas have be flexible
    to adapting to the current limitations. It might be the situation now where they
    will have to start out simpler, maybe with only a few possible compositions from
    each font, then eventually they can get more extensive as computers and softwares
    advance."

  body: "No matter how you twist it, it will ALWAYS come down to the Type 1 limitation
    at some point: \r\n\r\n1. When a document that uses an OpenType PS font is printed
    on a PostScript printer, the printer driver converts it to one or more Type 1
    fonts since PostScript (at least Level 1 and 2, but I think also 3) don't have
    the notion of the CFF format. The conversion is lossless so there is no quality
    loss because the glyph definitions in OpenType PS and Type 1 are based on the
    same drawing model. \r\n\r\n2. Some applications, e.g. Corel Draw, *always* convert
    TrueType / OpenType TT fonts to Type 1 when sending them to the printer. While
    PostScript Level 2 and 3 understand TrueType natively (encoded as so-called Type
    42), yet Corel's printing engine doesn't use it. Note that FontLab applications
    do a smart conversion from TrueType to PostScript curves by removing unnecessary
    points in the destination PostScript outlines. However, the Corel printing engine
    does not do that so the increased number of on-curve points in the TrueType font
    results in a converted Type 1 fonts with the same, relatively large number of
    nodes. So a complex TrueType font is even more likely to make the PostScript printer
    crash when used with Corel Draw. \r\n\r\n3. The PostScript printer driver on Windows
    has the ability to convert TrueType to Type 1 the same way as Corel Draw does.
    This is off by default in the printer driver if you use a modern PostScript printer,
    but with some imagesetters and older printers, it's on. Then, the \"Corel\" limitations
    apply to all applications that the user uses. The Mac OS printer driver has similar
    capabilities though I don't think the user has explicit control over it as on
    Windows (but I may be mistaken, I don't know the Mac OS printing subsystem well
    enough). \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"
