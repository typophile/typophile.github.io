  shop, it was used on\r\nItalian canned goods. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I have redrawn what
  I think the\r\n'n' looked like. Overall the face is quite narrow,\r\ntaught and
  squarish. It has a very nice \r\nrythym and I have a sneaking suspicion it is\r\nof
  Dutch origin. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n\r\nkris."

    character. I like your version of the n, too.
