body: I know that this has probably been extended, and I know that it is oh, so close
  to Franklin Gothic Heavy...the problem is I know that it isn't Franklin Gothic heavy.
  Many subtle differences. Does anyone know offhand what this is? Any help is appreciated
  (as are any names of bastard Franklin Gothics that I might be able to try). Thanks.

    try using this version of [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php|the
    Sans Serif Font ID Guide]], you can try selecting the letterforms that you want
    to match and see which sans fonts in the database might be <em>structurally</em>
    similar.\r\n\r\nFranklin Gothic has a combination of my seven key letters (a,
    e, g, G, M, R and y) that at least eight other families also use. However, you
    may not care about whether the G has a chin, or the a has a tail, so you can broaden
    the range of answers by selecting only the letters that matter to you.\r\n\r\n
