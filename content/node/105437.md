  body: "Hello,\r\nthank you very much for this picture. Would it be possible to have
    other scans of the typeface to view the complete alphabet. This will allow me
    to pursue a personal research around typographic structures put in place by the
    Didot family in modern typography. I will be very grateful. thank you"

  body: Thank you for that link, it will allow me to deepen my knowledge to the work
    of this family greatly interested me. Forgive me if the word typographical structures
    is not appropriate, can we rather speak of a sense of balance and relationship
    between the letters (?) ... Thank you for your details.
