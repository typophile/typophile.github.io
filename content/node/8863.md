  concave/cupped stems in letterpress sans serifs puzzles me. Is it something that
  comes in the pressing, or are the curves already there in the metal type itself
  by the punch cutters, as I have always thought? I&#39;ve never tried a letterpress

  body: Timo <BR> <BR>I found it very hard to follow that thread, and I&#39;m an old
    letterpress dude, but Evert did steal my phototype is the dark ages of typography.
    Naughty boy. No problem though, I&#39;ve changed my mind about that anyway. <BR>
    <BR>I could not find the concave/cupped stems reference but letterpress is a physical
    sculptural relief, the concave or cupped stems would be part of the surface of
    the type as the relief shoulder is a subsurface ink drain and would &#34;generally&#34;
    maintain an outwardly growing angle for that purpose. Letterpress ink is quite
    viscous and has an attraction characteristic, so it is quite problematic as it
    will cling to the outer surface of the letterform if the presswork is not &#34;careful.&#34;
    But to answer your question, this would not be part of the &#34;pressing&#34;
    &#40;impression&#41;. <BR> <BR>Problems can occur with press roller direction
    in regard to ink transfer &#40;pushing of ink across the surface of the letterform&#41;.
    It is quite possible that a cognizant letterform design &#40;concave/cupped&#41;
    stems, would in some situations, provide a solution. But this would not have been
    something that would have concerned a punchcutter. Rollers were first used in
    1812 and punchcutting had been going on for near four centuries prior to that.

    straight line is a dead line&#39;... Yes, the thread is really winding. <BR> <BR>Evert
    talks about how the tangible relief of letterpress printing gives the type more
    &#34;tension&#34;, and if I understood it correctly, causes printed outlines to
    curve, and that he tried to emulate this effect in FF Legato by drawing curved
    outlines. <BR> <BR>I think stems curved this way could be called flared? <BR>
    <BR>When I said punchcutters, I meant the makers of metal types in general, sorry

    <BR>I guess it&#39;s the uneven pressure on paper that causes ink to spread more
    around large unprinted areas, than in the densely printed mid-line areas? <BR>
    <BR>I also assume that rectangles in metal type were generally made more pincushion
    shaped, having cups and thorns, than what has been the norm in digital type...'

  body: Timo <BR> <BR>The &#34;effect&#34; is caused by impression and ink gain. Both
    are variable. Too much of either and you get this blobby mess.  <BR> <BR>I think
    though that a distinction should be made between punchcutters and those who later
    used the pantograph. There would be a natural compensation on the part of the
    punchcutter, though as Fournier is credited as saying, &#34;It is not right to
    blame the letter for the fault of the ink.&#34; In other words, it is the printer&#39;s
    fault. <BR> <BR>It would not be uneven pressure as caused by impression but more
    an unequal lay or charge of the ink on various parts of the form. Smaller letters
    would get more ink than larger letters, etc. Or the reverse, larger letters might
    be starved when smaller letters are printing well. <BR> <BR>From what I can tell,
    very little in the way of ink trapping and letterform shaping was intentially
    done in type design specifically for letterpress &#40;though it can well benefit
    from such concerns&#41;. There would have been an organic approach to punchcutting
    that might have naturally compensated but it is not until a good third of the
    way into the century that some thought was given to &#34;designing&#34; for the
    technical process itself. I think this comes more into play with photofilm, which
    presented unique problems, where optical compensation, thorns, ink traps, etc.,
    were necessary to prevent letterform distortion during the photo process. <BR>
    <BR>I suspect some curature would provide a form of legibility at small sizes,
    probably why Optima performed so well in its various mechanical configurations,
    Linotype, foundry...  <BR> <BR>I have rebuilt some faces specifically for letterpress.
    I worked on Crystal a while back. Quite a job as this particular face has optical
    wizardry builit into it &#40;particularly in the way the inline curves capture
    the ink, and compensate with ink gain&#41;. This was taken from foundry printed
    specimens and these compared to the actual metal type face at 24-pt and then adjusted
    further to compensate for the pecularities of letterpress printing at a smaller
    size. I recently received the printed piece and was relieved to see it had performed
    quite well. An image of the before and after follows <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange <BR>

  body: Gerald <BR> <BR>Oh yes, the inking makes a difference too, but does the inking
    process explain the consistently flared stems, being thinner in the middle? Roller
    direction perhaps? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it is a &#34;blobby mess&#34;, it&#39;s
    a consistent fenomenon present more or less in all letterpress sans in text sizes
    that I have seen. I think it helps against optical diffusion. That&#39;s why so
    few people notice it. <BR> <BR>And how about cups? Could they appear &#34;by the
    process&#34;, or do they have to be in the metal from the start? <BR> <BR>I also
    thought the punchcutters must have compensated the ink gain intuitively, but the
    example is Univers, which I guess wasn&#39;t handcut?  Atleast the original drawings
    were quite geometrical. <BR> <BR>I would like to see the final printed Crystal
    A, if it&#39;s possible.

  body: Timo <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t looked at any scientific studies on the dynamics
    of pressure flow but the cups and flared stems you are seeing could easily be
    accounted for by the amount of ink lay, roller pressure, roller direction... I
    doubt these features would have been incorporated in metal typefaces for technical
    purposes, and if they were, it would have been for aesthetic reasons. <BR> <BR>I
    would imagine that Univers was cut with a matrix cutting pantograph &#40;which
    first appeared in the late nineteenth century and fell into general use in the
    early twentieth&#41;. Wood type was cut from pantograph enlargements very early
    in the century, almost from the get go. <BR> <BR>I scanned the piece &#40;note
    this doesn&#39;t reveal the optical nuance of the relief impression which will
    often visually compensate for ink gain by adding dimension&#41;. This measures
    about 1-1/2 by 2-1/2 inches. So the type would be the equivalent of 14- or 15-pt.
    It is enlarged here which doesn&#39;t really reveal the intent. This was printed
    from a copper photoengraving without dampening the paper. Note the border rule
    was supplied to act as an ink support. The top A differs from the A in the second
    line because of its isolation, it takes the roller pressure hit all by its lonesome
    &#40;and looks heavier as a result&#41; whereas the second A has its neighbors
    to help it along. This problem can often be adjusted during presswork through
    careful makeready which may or may not have been done in this case. Basically
    the idea is to get the stuff to look a little better to compensate for expected
    anomolies, not to change the look of the face. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/64782.jpg"

  body: The evenness of stroke weight in sans letterpress printing depends greatly
    on the printing. At one extreme, you have the blobbified Univers linked above
    &#40;are we <i>sure</i> that isn&#39;t flexo, incidentally?&#41;. At the other,
    you have the near-perfection of the 1912 ATF specimen book &#40;to which this
    <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1912/p0668_sm.jpg">200 dpi scan</a> does not
    do justice&#41;. Even so, the latter is not <i>quite</i> as homogenous and colorless
    as we&#39;re used to in offset printing today. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t seen explicit
    pincushion-shaped cups&#40;&#42;&#41; and thorns in any of the metal type I&#39;ve
    seen, but these features were quite common in the &#40;bad&#41; early days of
    phototypesetting, largely to compensate for fuzzy focus in the photographic reproduction
    process. <BR> <BR>&#42; Here I&#39;m talking about inner corners joining at 90
    degrees or so. For inner corners of significantly smaller angle, trapping is common
    and has been since the early days. Hrant will probably have something to add about
    this.

    <BR> <BR>Actually trapping is quite uncommon in metal type. And the &#34;early

    up in Hrant&#39;s hands and he was able to find evidence of traps but this was
    a European foundry face produced about mid-century &#40;1960 I believe, which
    is quite late in metal production&#41;. Concern about ink trapping was not articulated
    in print until the late 1920s or 1930s &#40;I can&#39;t handily find the reference&#41;.
    Any evidence to it prior to this time would likely be an inarticulated innate
    part of the punchcutting process. [Where is Giampa the Great when one actually

    process and in checking through possible faces that was the first thing I looked

  body: Timo <BR> <BR>Yes, paper could have a lot to do with it. Generally the best
    impression/inking is going to come from careful work with a dampened handmade
    sheet. But in most cases that is not what you are going to find. Commercial grade
    papers with external sizing will resist absorption of the ink, with the complication
    that progressively ink will remain on the form, and accompanying ink gain. <BR>
    <BR>The titling I furnished was printed dry &#40;I assume&#41; on Inveresk Somerset
    &#40;not a paper I am all that familiar with&#41;. The printer was Sebastian Carter
    at Rampant Lions Press &#40;UK&#41;. But the intention was to have the type remain
    open at the smaller sizes, and Sebastian did a remarkable job of holding that.
    It really does not provide much useful information to blow up smaller letterpress
    type to examine the distortions of presswork. Essentially we would be back to
    our specimen &#40;which was sort of the point&#41;. The idea is to minimize distortion
    so that to the viewing eye the types look crisp and clean at the size intended.  <BR>
    <BR>Raph&#39;s ATF specimen would likely have been printed by some very seasoned
    printers on a large cylinder press with a very smooth stock paper, which would
    greatly have diminished the kind of problems facing contemporary fine letterpress
    printers who are not so well equipped. You won&#39;t really see much of this kind
    of quality in commercial letterpress printing in the post-Depression years. <BR>
    <BR>That little halo of lighted color that you see ringing the samples you have
    provided is carrier separation. The roller pressure is a bit high for the stock,
    and the ink is a tad too loose. This can usually be prevented by using a higher
    viscosity ink which will resist this tendency. Easier to say by looking at the
    sample though rather than having to deal with the actual configuration of the
    job.

  body: Timo <BR> <BR>The effect that you term cupping and flaring is normally just
    considered swelling. The ink has traveled beyond the letterform and the dynamics
    of that flow in combination with the pecularities of the letterform, isolated
    stems, curves, angles, forms these oddities. In your latest example, look at the
    fill in the bottom angles of the lowercase w. There is surface flow contributed
    by the angled strokes whereas in the lowercase k there is less incidence simply
    because of the further flow down the stem. Another example is the narrow curve
    of the lowercase f compared to the wider curve of the lowercase r. With inappropriate
    presswork the shapes of the letterforms themselves contribute to the problem.
    If the roller direction was reversed or printed from the side the patterns would
    change. At the microcosmic level here, the flaring/cupping is the result of minute
    isolation. Note how the lower truncation of the lowercase e does not seem to suffer
    because of the proximity of the top curve/crossbar junction. <BR> <BR>Letterpress
