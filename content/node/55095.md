body: "I am very proud to announce the release of my display typeface Fiasco. \r\nFiasco
  is a psychedelic constructivist face. Extremely influenced by the new rave trend.
  It is a reflex of it's excesses. Way too many elements, bright  neon colors, and
  that not-knowing-when-to-stop sort of behavior. Excess would be the word that best
  describes it. Acid House aesthetic remixed by the nu school djs. Fiasco dances to
  Justice, Simian, to nu rave, nu disco, electrorock and baltmore. Born in the 80's,
  grew in the 90's and appeared a couple years ago. Smileys, gas masks, raves, lollypops,
  it's all back. Neon Flashbacks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fiasco1_5600.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fiasco2_3936.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fiasco3_3690.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fiasco4_4168.jpg]\r\n\r\nFiasco

    late for that now. :)\r\nBut you or I should design a different one with that
    name in mind. \r\n\r\n "
