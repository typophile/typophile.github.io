body: "Dear all, \r\nWe've had many interesting discussions about Arabic type design
  on this forum and there are many gifted designers who read this. I should have put
  this in the news section but I can't seem to find my way around the RSS feed (sorry).
  So, if anyone is interested, Linotype is hosting its first Arabic Type Design Competition
  and the deadline is October 31, so there's a lot of time still left! \r\n\r\nThe
  jury is made up of renowned calligraphers, type designers, and academics who have
  each offered a great contribution to the development of Arabic typography. They
  are Samir Sayegh (Lebanon), Fiona Ross (UK), Mamoun Sakkal (Syria/USA), Kris Holmes
  (USA), and Huda Abi Fares Smitshuijzen (Lebanon/Netherlands). Also participating
  as an honorary guest juror is the master calligrapher and type designer Hermann
  Zapf.\r\n\r\nThe competition has 3 categories: text, display, and calligraphic.
  The text category is reserved for text faces, the display category for designs intended
  for larger sizes, and the calligraphic category is intended for designs based on
  calligraphic models or any undigitised work. \r\n\r\nFor details about the submission
  of typefaces and for further details please contact: \r\n+49 (0) 6172 484 2460 or
  by mail to contest@linotype.com \r\n\r\nMore information is available at the website
  at www.linotype.com/contest\r\n\r\nAlso, you can find the full press release at:
