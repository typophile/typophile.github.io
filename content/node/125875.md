body: "Hello,\r\nI wonder if anybody has come across this problem and could help me
  to understand it further. I noticed that when the hamza diacritic (U+02BE) follows
  'a' and the two are italicised, the hamza either gets thrown off or disappears.
  This occurs for a number of fonts when using the Adobe World-Ready composer in InDesign
  CS6, Windows 10.\r\nThe problem occurs for a number of fonts, including system fonts
  like Calibri (Microsoft), Arial (Monotype_, and Times New Roman (Monotype).\r\nIt
  doesn't make a difference whether using either the paragraph or single-word version
  of the World-ready composer.\r\nThe following image should make it clearer. I have
  also attached a PDF so you can copy and paste the words to see for yourself. As
  you can see the problem does not occur for the ayn diacritic  (U+02BF). I have not
  managed to find any other problematic combinations so far.\r\nInterestingly, the
  problem doesn't occur on a couple of modified fonts I tested...so perhaps the issue
  is down to kerning tables being copied from font to font and Adobe world-ready composer
  not interacting very well with them?"

  body: "InDesign has some not well-described behavior with respect to nonspacing
    accents: if you insert a base glyph and an accent <em>and</em> the font contains
    a combined glyph for these, ID will use that glyph instead of the two separate
    ones. You can see that if you type \"T\u1E9Ar\u012Bkh\" with a single \"\u1E9A\"
    character [U+1E9A] and with separate glyphs for the \\a and Hamza. To see what
    happens, also open the Glyphs panel.\r\nIn the first word, you cannot move the
    cursor 'between' the two characters; in the second, you can, but if you select
    the \\a you will see that the character is not selected in the Glyphs panel (usually,
    a single selected character gets highlighted in this panel). If you select just
    the Hamza, the Glyphs panel will report you selected the combined character!\r\n\r\nLooking
    at your samples, I'd guess that Libertine does not contain a combined '\u1E9A'
    character, and so you get the separate nonspacing Hamza glyph over the \\a \u2013
    badly positioned, because the Hamza glyph's position is \u2013 necessarily \u2013
    \"generic\"; it does not 'know' over what character it gets positioned.[1]\r\n\r\nI
    cannot replicate the problem with italicized text, though. What exact version
    number of Calibri are you using? If this differs from mine (6.18, default for
    Windows 10), it might be an additional problem in the OpenType encoding. Also,
    check if the characters \\a, Hamza, and U+1E9A (their combo) are available in
    both your regular and italic Calibri.\r\n\r\n[1] Okay, I just downloaded Libertine
    O and checked. The off-center Hamza in the combined character is as-is, in the
    Regular font. But the Italic font contains an unwelcome surprise: the combined
    character '\u1E9A' U+1E9A <em>is missing its Hamza</em>\u2009! So that, at least,
    is not on InDesign to blaim."

  body: "Hello Theunis de Jong. Thank you for your help. I am using the default Calibri
    6.18 in Windows 10 also. \r\n\r\nSo, the problem is that Adobe world-ready composer
    is automatically switching the \"a\" + \"U+02BE\" combination to \"U+1E9A\". You
    are right, this does not occur if a typeface is being used which does not have
    \"U+1E9A\" e.g. Lucida Sans Unicode.\r\n\r\nAs you know, when we type \"f\" +
    \"i\" we get the \"FB01\" ligature (provided the ligature is available in the
    font and the feature is turned on) so I thought the problem may be fixed by turning
    off ligatures but this did not fix it.\r\n\r\nI see that in Libux Libertine, U+1E9A
    is in fact just the base character \"a\" without the accent so it makes sense
    that when \"a\" + \"U+02BE\" is turned to \"U+1E9A\" the diacritic disappears.\r\n"

    as mentioned in the post. Not sure if that makes a difference though.
