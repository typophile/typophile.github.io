  body: Sorry it&#39;s not very clear from the image. But it has a very distinctive
    triangle above the i. I have a hunch it could be Napa, but can&#39;t seem to find
    many references to it anywhere!

  body: John, its a logo! I would substitute a triangle for a dot or rectangle on
    a font in a logo. Three words, you are lucky they didn&#39;t make even more changes.  <BR>

    You have two fonts and manipulation.
