body: "Hello everybody, this is my first post, I'm french, please excuse my poor english.\r\n\r\nI'm
  designing a logo for a company involved in promoting and installing solar panels
  to produce energy.\r\n\r\nThe brief is tricky.\r\n\r\nThe company is at birth stage,
  but it shoulp compete with majors like Solar BP (British Petroleum etc..).\r\nThe
  company name means \"blue\" in French. It represents the blue of the sky and concepts
  such as pure, air, nature, tomorow, etc... The problemis that this name does not
  represent the activity, the color either.\r\n\r\nI thought the only choice was to
  play with some type. Do you know a font that would vehicle the ideas I just listed
  ?\r\n\r\nAny help woul be muchly appreciated."

    no matter how bad you might think they are, and then you might get some feedback.
    Even providing us with some examples of typefaces you like and why you like them
    would help.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    was just asking for some help or advice, new eyes are always welcomed when you
    work alone.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if this was not the good way to ask. The reason why
    I did not show my sketches is that I was expecting fresh ideas, not turnarounds
    of what I already had.\r\n\r\n+"

    to the see the concept. I guess your energy logo is lacking in energy.\r\n\r\nHave
    you observed and analysed other companies logos in the same industry?"
