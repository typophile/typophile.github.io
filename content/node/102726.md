  body: In Europe we call it Schweizer Brochure (Holland) or Schweizer Broschur (Germany)
    with sewn binding and open back. You can choose the color of the yarn and some
    binders also can color the glue that is used. I have seen a translation in English  where
    it is called Swiss Brochure.
