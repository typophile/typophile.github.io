body: "Is monaco called monaco because it contains, in proper order, the letters which
  form the word 'mono' (because it is a monospaced font)?\r\n\r\nJust wondering, I
  bet it's been pointed out before and it's probably laughably obvious. But I thought
  it was (borrows American slang) kinda neat. Sorry to bore you."

  body: "I think Monaco was named that as part of the original Apple font set with
    place names. I recall Geneva being another. The fact that it was a mono probably
    made calling it Monaco easier. They were made by Bigelow & Holmes. \r\n\r\nAccording
    to Mark Simonson here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typographica.org/000785.php\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nHere's
    a list of the Mac \"city\" fonts:</cite>\r\n<cite>\r\nChicago*\r\nGeneva*\r\nNew
    York*\r\nMonaco*\r\nAthens*\r\nSan Francisco*\r\nLondon*\r\nVenice*\r\nToronto*
    **\r\nTaliesin\r\nCairo\r\nLos Angeles\r\n</cite>\r\n<cite>\r\n*Shipped with the
    original Mac.\r\n**Dropped after one of the first system updates.</cite>\r\n<cite>\r\nMicrosoft
    had one, too, which was included with MultiPlan called Seattle. It came in 10-
    and 20-point. I recall that it was the first Mac font in those sizes. The 10-
    and 20-point versions of Geneva came later.\r\n</cite><cite>\r\nOne other bit
    of trivia: The version of Geneva that came with the first release of the Mac system
    software had a one-story lowercase a. It was changed to two-story with the first
    system update.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nI realize I haven't answered the question completely
    but I hope this helps.\r\n"

  body: "Written by Susan Kare\r\n\r\n\"Landing in the Macintosh group as a bitmap
    graphic designer was a lucky break for me, and one interesting part of the job
    was designing screen fonts. It was especially enjoyable because the Macintosh
    was able to display proportional typefaces, leaving behind the tyranny of monospace
    alphabets with their narrow m's and wide i's.\r\n\r\nThe first Macintosh font
    was designed to be a bold system font with no jagged diagonals, and was originally
    called \"Elefont\". There were going to be lots of fonts, so we were looking for
    a set of attractive, related names. Andy Hertzfeld and I had met in high school
    in suburban Philadelphia, so we started naming the other fonts after stops on
    the Paoli Local commuter train: Overbrook, Merion, Ardmore, and Rosemont. (Ransom
    was the only one that broke that convention; it was a font of mismatched letters
    intended to evoke messages from kidnapers made from cut-out letters ).\r\n\r\nOne
    day Steve Jobs stopped by the software group, as he often did at the end of the
    day. He frowned as he looked at the font names on a menu. \"What are those names?\",
    he asked, and we explained about the Paoli Local.\r\n\r\n\"Well\", he said, \"cities
    are OK, but not little cities that nobody's ever heard of. They ought to be WORLD
    CLASS cities!\"\r\n\r\nSo that is how Chicago (Elefont), New York, Geneva, London,
    San Francisco (Ransom), Toronto, and Venice (Bill Atkinson's script font) got
    their names.\""

  body: Anyway your idea is probably right. Seems like a few of them had cheeky reasons
    for their city names. ie Cairo = hieroglyphics reference.

    are missing, like Toronto and San Francisco. I wonder what the legality of these
    fonts are? Some of the old mac fonts are in dire need of fixing so they work with
    modern systems. A re-mastered version of Cairo would be amazing. "

  body: Some don't really make any sense though. Toronto and Los Angeles for example..
    Probably just filler at that point.
