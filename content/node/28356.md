body: I was hoping someone could ID the typefaces used in these two samples. Let me
  know if you need any further info.

  body: Thank you very much for the quick response. Out of curiosity, how did you
    go about making the ID? Were you already familiar with them? I had no idea how
    to begin my search.

  body: "I can answer for Mike: he was already familiar with them.\r\n\r\nThe most
    effective way to get an ID is to ask the font freaks who just know what's out
    there. So you made the right choice posting here."

  body: "Thank you Stephen, that is basically the right answer, but I would also add
    that I use references most of the time. Unlike some of the people here who have
    lived with fonts for most of their careers, I am a relative latecomer to this
    passion, so as much as my own recollection of typefaces, I rely a lot on piles
    of books and catalogs, and ID-friendly websites, like MyFonts.com, Identifont,
    Font Pool, Dafont.com, Veer.com, Fontshop.com (which is getting better for this
    purpose), and even the Guides on my own site. In fact, I found Tarzana by using
    Google to search my site for the phrase 'reversed 3'.  I have written descriptions
    of the oddities in the Sans Serif fonts in the Sans Serif Guide, and Google found
    this for Tarzana, Reykjavik Two, Lebensjoy and Case 150903 Pluto (and also for
    Eplica in the Serif Guide notes). It didn't find Dyadis this way, but I knew that
    was another.\r\n\r\nI also knew Eplica, because I bought this font a couple of
    years ago.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Stephen is absolutely right that asking the font
    fanatics here is the best way to get a quick ID. I do it too when I get stuck.\r\n\r\n-
