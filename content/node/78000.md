  have a script font that has a style set with an alternate r, but certain combinations
  need to be ligated - wr and cr in the example below. I only want the alternate style
  ligatures to appear in the style set. Can this be done?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ssligs_6659.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  way wr and cr should appear is the bottom image.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "If you followed Jens' logic, then your <em>ss01</em> feature already has
    replaced <em>all</em> \"r\"s by \"r.ss01\"s. This means that\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>sub
    r r.ss01 by r_r.ss01;</em>\r\nwould not work because there is no \"r\" left in
    the glyph string handed over to the <em>ss01</em> feature. Instead you need to
    replace two consecutive \"r.ss01\"s\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>sub r.ss01
    r.ss01 by r_r.ss01;</em>\r\n"

  body: "Now that Nick's problem is resolved, I have a question: What is the argument
    against just putting the whole thing in a stylistic set? Ordering within the set
    would be important, but after substituting the individual glyphs, why not just
    go ahead and substitute the ligatures right there?\r\n\r\nIf you remember Wilson
    Greek, it came with an extensive set of ligatures -- I suppose you would call
    them historical ligatures. I built several stylistic sets, beginning with the
    most commonly seen ligatures (in, say, ss05), and making new sets with an ever-increasing
    number included. The thinking was that most authors wouldn't want all the ligatures;
    some are pretty obtuse.\r\n\r\nIt worked fine. I'll allow this is only for our
    in-house composition & not a for-sale font that has to work on numerous applications
    programs. Was that the only reason to involve the liga feature?\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nExample
    from the Wilson Greek\r\n\r\nfeature ss10 {\r\nsub alpha' iota' @ENDS by alpha_iota.terminal;\r\nsub

  body: Hello Charles, there is no argument against this. It depends on which kind
    of behavior you intend to achieve. So if you, as designer of a typeface, think
    that certain ligatures are essential part of a specific Stylistic Set, then you
    should include them there. If you consider the stylistic alternates as being independent
    of ligatures that involve these alternates, and want typographers to choose alternates
    and ligatures (whichever default or alternate shapes they may have) separatedly,
    you should deal with alternates in a Stylistic Set feature and with ligatures
    in the Ligatures feature.
