body: I'm new to this forum and not sure if this topic was discussed before, since
  I couldn't find a search field anywhere. I'm in a middle of a project and just can't
  load the font to my Mac Pro 10.5.1 desktop system. I actually had the client put
  the fonts on a CD for me, since e-mailing or ftp didn't work. Looks like it's a
  PostScript Type 1 outline font. I tried to load it with Lynotype font Explorer and
  also Suitcase, but it didn't work. I'm out of my wits and can't proceed working
  on my project until I have this issue resolved. Any ideas? I included a screenshot
  of the one of the font icons.

    on a CD or transfered via e-mail or ftp. Just not sure how to get around that. '

  body: If the fonts were  ever sent via ftp or email and were saved as a .zip archive
    chances are the files were stripped of the dataforks. Your best bet would be to
    either have them send you a .sit archive of the same fonts or contact the foundry
    from which they were licensed for you to use and ask for a new copy.

  body: Pretty sure it's the datafork issue. I did some more research and it seams
    like an issue with LWFN fonts. I try to get them directly from  the foundry. Thanks
    again for your advise.

    what gets stripped is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork\">resource
    fork</a>."
