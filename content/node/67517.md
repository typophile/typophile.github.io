  inspired me to some sketches. I think it would be great for fashion magazines or
  music booklets.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think and if it's too close to
  something existing I din't think of yet (I know there are some connections to Avant
  Garde but I think it wouldn't be too close).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion-font-specimen1_5673.jpg]"

    mind if it is close to something already existing. Univers probably wouldn't have
    been designed if Adrian Frutiger thought it looked too much like Helvetica...
    But then again...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good concept. Things like E, F, K are the big strength.\r\n\r\nWhat you need
    to do is round out your curves. S, O, Q are good; you should want to make the
    other curved letters remind you of them. U should not be flat on the bottom. C
    needs to taper the curve into the horizontals more smoothly with regard to weight.
    The same thing is not quite as noticeable in D but it would help. G you may need
    to rethink entirely.\r\n\r\nThe stacked LL needs more space in it. CC is a good
    guide for the amount of space."

    refinements, optical corrections, redraw some characters from scratch and added
    some numerals. Next step would be adding more ligatures and special characters.\r\n\r\nI'm
    really looking forward to hear what you think. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion-font-specimen2_4441.jpg]"

  body: "When I read your text I'm a bit distracted by your R, it seems to come from
    another typeface. For example, compared to the R, the B seems a bit simple, or
    the R too decorative.\r\n\r\nI like some words (Fireworks could make a great logo),
    but it maybe needs more research in the overall.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll not find
    my opinon to hard, and this is just my opinion.\r\n\r\nBest regards."

  body: "Thank you Bernard,\r\n\r\nfunny thing is, that it all started with the R.
    Although I have to admit this is the character that is a bit off the grid. I already
    re-arranged the R to fit it into the grid but it looked awful. Just like it would
    hinder the concept instead of supporting it. So I left it that way. It's still
    the character I don't know what will happen to it.\r\n\r\nAfter your post I think
    it's a good point to rethink the B and offer a second character just like with
    A, V, W or M for example.\r\n\r\nAnd your totally right, I also think that it's
    possible to do some great logo-type with this font. 'VIKTOR & ROLF' or 'COSMOPOLITAN'
    are already some examples I like.\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughts"

    with has a better style, but the R that is in Palermo at the bottom pic reads
    better. The R in RocknRolla is very easily read, but stylistically isn't as good
    as the other two R's I mentioned in my opinion. Not a big fan of the R in Birdie.\r\n"

  body: Hi Bernard, thank you very much for your sketch. I will give it a try although
    your 'A' won't be possible because all the horizontals are thin. The 'B' could
    be possible. After your hint to equalize 'B' and 'R' I thought I had a good result
    withe the last draft or do you think to go back to the first 'R'???
