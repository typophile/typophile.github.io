  body: "Thank you guys!\r\n\r\n@eliason & R. :\r\nClassification is really rather
    difficult to me, but since the FF DIN seems to be classified as a geometric and
    i was very much inspired by it i thought that would be how to call it (though
    it looks different).\r\n\r\nBut i like the term neo-grotesque. (can\u2019t change
    the picture though =D )"

  body: "According to Wikipedia, FF DIN is (also) classified as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FF_DIN\">realist
    sans</a>. This type of sans-serif falls somewhere in between humanist and geometric
    sans-serif typefaces. The humanist sans shows strong influences of handwriting,
    so there is considerable stroke contrast, and the glyph shapes are based on those
    of Venetian or Garalde old-style typefaces.  <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/optima_pro_roman/ot_ps?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=60&sample_text=GKMQabeltuy&ft=liga\">Optima</a>
    is one of the best known humanist sans-serif typefaces. The geometric sans, by
    contrast, relies heavily on \u201Cgeometric shapes, like near-perfect circle and
    square\u201D (Wikipedia), i.e. the letters are rather constructed than handwritten,
    and display little stroke contrast. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/futura_pro_book/opentype_cff/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=60&sample_text=GKMQabeltuy&ft=liga&acs_pt=32\">Futura</a>
    is a prime example of that. FF DIN and your work are not quite as rigid as that,
    but also straighter in appearance than a humanist sans, so that\u2019s why I\u2019d
    call them realist (or neo-grotesque, an alternative term if you like that better
    ;)."

  body: "@ R.: You\u2019re right =)\r\nI was confusing the tags of FF DIN in MyFonts
    with possible classifications (my bad) \u2026 so there <strong>is</strong> something
    between humanist and geometric, that\u2019s fascinating, i\u2019ve seen myself
    confronted with a choice between those two. Unfortunately my teacher was a little
    old school, so he only taught us the [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_16518|DIN
    16518]] classification, according to which the font would simply be called group
    6: sans serif linear antiqua (Gruppe VI: Serifenlose Linear-Antiqua in german).\r\nWould
    it be silly to ask you about a more adequate system to classify fonts (may be
    with a source of some kind)?"

    On her <a href=\"http://kupferschrift.de/cms/tag/classification/\">blog</a> she
    has published a number of posts about various classification systems (some in
    German, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem for you). I have not read all
    of them, but she probably also makes mention of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI_classification\">Vox-ATypI
    classification</a> according to which FF DIN would be a neo-grotesque (or a realist
    sans). I like that one.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way: good look with your first typeface!
