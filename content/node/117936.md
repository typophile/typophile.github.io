  references? I'm doing paper on typography and would like more than just quotes and
  examples showing why something just works. Having some scientific facts would be
  helpful as well rather than just what we all have learned and can instinctively
  all agree works best for legibility and readability.

    included the terms \"readability\" and \"legibility.\" Most scientific studies
    make assumptions using simplified meanings of those terms that most typographers
    -- or even lay people -- would not accept. (Spend a year reading W.V.O. Quine,
    or take my word for it. Best would be read Quine...)\r\n\r\nYou could, for example,
    do a study showing standard deviation in (1) comprehension and (2) speed, for
    reading a document set in two particular typefaces -- though even that is tricky
    -- but the sample size would be tremendous to draw any generally useful data.
    To make such a study based on a *supposed* single variable (say, serif versus
    sans serif) would be so full of flaws no one should accept it, even if the number
    of <cite>people</cite> taking the test approached the number needed to get useful
    standard deviation numbers. The answer would be valid only for the two typefaces
    selected for the test.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nWhile not exactly a scientific issue,
    you can see a parallel with, say, the (1) philosophy of aesthetics and (2) art.
    Even were it possible to come up with a set of principles to define \"what art
    is,\" (which would satisfy #1)  that's not to say you have a decision procedure
    -- it will not answer the question \"is <cite>this</cite> a work of art\" (i.e.,
    #2).\r\n\r\nTo put the matter another way, a useful scientific theory is capable
    of prediction. It may well do so outside it's data set (in fact, it must to be
    predictive). The data is the constraint -- it doesn't matter how well something
    predicts, if any empirical data conflicts, the theory is wrong (of course, that
    leads many to start \"explaining\" exceptions). Actually, the second constraint
    is it's predictive power. If you really have an answer, the model should predict
    how to construct a typeface that is either easier to read, or easier to comprehend
    (I'm not going to assume the two are the same).\r\n"

  body: "The problem with most studies on legibility is that they only tell something
    about typography and nothing about legibility, let alone typeface design. In many
    of the scientific studies I read, the influence of typography (poor relationship
    of type size, line length and line feed, typefaces tested at the same body size
    but with x-heights that differ considerably, badly printed or photo-copied samples,
    low-res screens, glossy paper etc.) was much bigger that the differences between
    the typefaces tested. Many other strange assumptions of scientists about typeface
    design contribute to results that are not valuable to typeface design, such as
    \u2018we tested Courier in order to be able to say something about the influence
    of serifs on legibility\u2019 or \u2018we tested Arial because it is a standard\u2019.
    \r\n\r\nSome of the studies of which I think they have been done \u2018good\u2019
    are those done by Dirk Wendt, Chuck Bigelow, Ann Bessemans, Nadine Chahine, Sofie
    Beier and Kevin Larson. But one has to take into account that in some cases it
    is hard to \u2018implement\u2019 the results into typeface design."

  body: "<blockquote>You think some of the creative sorts found here can't come up

    to help? I was thinking to have professional type designers select 5 sans typefaces
    they think are perfect for readability, 5 popular ones which are supposed to perform
    well and 5 popular ones with questionable readability and do the same for serif
    and have large control groups read a random page (not the same text) in each typeface
    and time the speed at which they're able to read the page. If the results of such
    a test would be all over the place then the conclusion would probably be that
    the design of the typeface is of secondary importance to the typographic setting.
    I strongly suspect however that not only will we see different results for each
    of the 3 groups per sans and serif, but we will see different results between
    sans and serif as well. With such a test I suspect we will have a great indication
    of what will work best. Whether a disprovable theory can be proposed on why one
    performs better than the other, I don't know. However at least we will be able
    to say statistically one will perform better than the other. That seems a lot
    more useful than our personal speculations and anecdotal evidence which is often
    circumstantial.\r\n\r\nI don't have the resources to perform a test like this.

    person would breathe normally naturally. You can perform these kind of tests without
    explaining what you're actually doing. Use control groups and protect the test.
    Tell the testers you're studying reading speed and tell them they will be tested
    for accuracy later so the quality of their reading doesn't decrease as they desperately
    try to perform better."

  body: "I think one big factor is that graphic designers have an interest in not
    accepting science and poking holes in it, as it means that the average citizen
    can do his own research and act on it and opens the designer up to being proven
    wrong (among other reasons). Throughout history, you see the same appeals to something
    being an art that science can't hope to understand from medicine to architecture,
    but then researchers find the answers. Hell, even jewelers, a purely aesthetic
    trade, have been overrun by engineers who have discovered ways to maximize the
    brightness of a stone. Recently, therapists (who, unlike actual psychiatrists,
    are barely screened before putting up a shingle) have been fighting monumentally
    against the idea that they should be basing their practice off of contemporary
    psychological research rather than a pop culture idea of what Freud said. For
    a good example of idiotic pushback in this very thread, look no further than the
    claim that you can't get somebody to read something without priming him when that's
    a problem that researchers solve constantly by putting the actual research in
    the prepwork. You don't even need to set up false research as a cover in this
    case, as you could just print out your consent form in whatever typeface you want
    and then test their comprehension of the consent form.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult
    to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding
    it."
