  bottom of the page, as well as at the top where they currently are? When I am at
  the end of a long thread, it is annoying to have to scroll up to the top to use
  the breadcrumbs. It would be convenient to be able to access them from the bottom,
  where I generally stop reading.\r\n\r\n(Yes, I know there is the browser back button,
  but I prefer the breadcrumb route, for some reason.)"

    the mean time, you can save scrolling time going back to the top of a long page
    by hitting the Home key on your keyboard. (The End key takes you to the bottom
    of the page.)"

  body: if you get a 5-button mouse, they let you do back and forward. I could never
    go back to a 3-button mouse, they are so early '00s :p

  body: That open office mouse looks like it needs some work though. The buttons all
    are the same size and color for the most part. I remember I had a RCA tv remote
    from the 90s where the remote controller had different color buttons, shapes sizes,
    and feels (some concave and others convex) for the different groups. I should
    of taken a picture of it, it was well designed, visually and tactile-ly (touchwise).

    its a lot of buttons, but it works really good for memorizing by touch or just
    glancing at. It was pretty wide from what I remember, probably the width of 2
    or 2.5 modern tv remotes."

    focus (not the comment entry box).

    elsewhere.
