body: "Hello typophiles...\r\n\r\nWhew, need some help here. Have a client that has
  offices in China, and I need to recreate a logo using the Chinese characters - and
  not spend an entire day searching through the glyph palette.\r\n\r\nI've used whatthefont.com
  in the past to identify fonts English fonts... Is there some other kind of website
  that could \"see\" the characters in a jpeg so I could copy / paste into my layout?\r\n\r\nIn
  the past, I've been able to simply copy / paste characters from supplied Word files
  or off their website - but there's nothing available for this particular logo (it's
  a new location).\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated - thanks in advance,
  everyone!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beijing_Clinical_Logo_Small_5553.jpg]"

    like the first two that oddly look like 'beauty' and 'country' \u2014, but wouldn't
    know how to pronounce them).\r\nThough if you can find somebody who reads Chinese,
    they could just type this out for you. If not here, why not ask on a Chinese forum
    of some sort?\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "I'd imagine because Dr Ken knows these characters. If you didn't, you could
    use a character dictionary, which traditionally order characters by radical. Most
    characters are made up of discrete elements, or radicals, of which there are traditionally
    216.\r\n\r\nAnother way of ordering characters is by number of strokes. So you
    count the strokes (made easier by the rigid rules governing stroke order) and
    skim through, say, 9-stroke characters.\r\n\r\nA newer method is called SKIP and
    is used in \"NTC's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary\" by Jack Halpern.
    It uses a combination of patterns and stroke count to look up characters and generally
    works well.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, \"Beautiful Country\" is America. But don't feel
    too flattered: \"beauty\" sounds similar to the ME in aMErica. It's a phonetic
    association.\r\n\r\n"
