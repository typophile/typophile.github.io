<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>What I usually do is to sneak a small digital camera into the theater. I sometimes have to sit through several showings to get good shots of the main titles, not to mention any other type that is used in a film--especially if it is used badly. <br> <br>As you might imagine, this is rather time consuming. Fortunately there are several theaters I know of that are in range of a WiFi hot spot. (It's more common than you might think, but, considering the density of Starbucks, not that surprising.) So, what I do is sneak my TiBook in as well. That way I can keep up with the Type ID Board and not miss out on getting the jump on anyone else here. <br> <br>I can usually ID fonts on sight, but there are many times I wish I had my type specimen books with me. (I used to bring Jaspert, McGrew, FontBook, and a few others, but it was killing my back.) Fortunately, with the WiFi connection, I can at least check the online specimens at MyFonts and the rest. <br> <br>Right now, in fact, I'm sitting through the second showing of The Haunted Mansion. It's really bad, but there is a scene near the beginning of the third act where they are looking at this "old" book and the title is set in Matrix (can you believe it?!). I would have gotten it in the previous showing, but an usher was standing nearby. It would have been too hard to explain. <br> <br>I should cut this short since the scene is coming up pretty soon. What's really annoying is, I bought a box of Milk Duds at the snack counter. I tried to eat too many at once and now I can't seem to get my tongue out of my cheek. <br> <br>Anyway, I haven't seen Kill Bill yet, so I can't help you with that one.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Uhm, I actually <i>do</i> take pictures of the credits.. I guess that makes me look pretty stupid now. Don't have anything from Kill Bill though, I was probably too blown away by the film. <br> <br>I seem to remember that the text titles between the chapters were set in Futura, although I might be confusing this with another movie.. And that's probably not the face you're looking for (serif? two-story g?), unless either one of us is completely deranged typographically. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Uhm, I actually do take pictures of the credits.. I guess that makes me look pretty stupid now.</i> <br> <br>Not really. That part wasn't far-fetched at all. There are people who bring video cameras, in fact. Back in college in the mid-seventies I brought a 35mm camera into a showing of 2001: A Space Odyssey and took a dozen or so pictures. I was a little obsessed with that movie at the time. <br> <br>I have to confess, my little story was partly inspired by a chapter in the book "A Year At The Movies" by Kevin Murphy. Murphy went to a different public showing of a movie every day for a year, and then wrote a book about it. On Thanksgiving, he managed to smuggle an entire Thanksgiving dinner into a theater under a very large overcoat. Pretty funny stuff.</div>

I checked the movie listings this morning to find something suitable for the story and there it was. I did fudge a bit on the show times.

I thought that that may have been the best part of the movie! They just don't do credits like they used to in the good old days. <br>But although i saw the film, i couldn't id the font for you, sorry.</div>

<div class=commentbody>So yeah... the Kill Bill titles... there are a few... <br> <br>Avant Garde for the proverb, a bit of Busorama for the studio titles... pause for the prelude... okay there's some Friz Quadrata (bold), then I'll be damned if that's not Bookman (bold, ITC?) for the film title. Followed by some more Avant Garde and Friz, throwing in a bit of Palatino to mix things up, then more of the AG/FQ combo, then back to Palatino, and finally Avant Garde for the Chapter titles. <br> <br>Certainly one of the more, er, 'typographically-rich' title sequences in recent memory. <br> <br>So the 'R' could be either Friz Quadrata or Palatino, but the non-closing 'g' could only be Friz, even though I don't recall seeing any lowercase...? <br> <br>Oh, and the end credits are Bookman again.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Yves! I'm just reading this so relatively speaking you're not late at all. I did get very nice presents, including several nifty sketchbooks and a Typography book. Hooray for Amazon wishlists! <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>It's been one <i>very</i> busy week full of deadlines, so busy in fact that I had to disable mail notification! Crazy, I know. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> Have a lot of catching up to do now.. Feels great to be back though!</div>
