  or typeface combination for my thesis dissertation, I&#39;ve tried a bunch but none
  have convinced me. <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone could help me with the choice&#40;s&#41;.
  Here are the absolutely necesary requirements: <BR> <BR>- That is prints nice on
  laser printers <BR>- Very complete family sets, as I&#39;ll probably be using various
  levels of hierarchy <BR>- Lining and old-style figures, as I&#39;ll be using lots
  of tables to display information <BR>- The most important one: that it&#39;s extremely
  readable <BR> <BR>Desirable qualities: <BR> <BR>-A large x-height <BR>-Economical
  on space without sacrificing readability <BR>-That it looks contemporary, intelligent
  and rational <BR> <BR>I&#39;m taking a look at Whitney &#40;H&amp;FJ&#41; right
  now for headings and tables. Is this a good choice? Any alternatives? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  also torn between making the body serifs or sans-serifs, any help on the matter
  would be greatly appreciated.'

  body: For print text, serifs are much more readable in my opinion. For headings
    and tables a sans is fine. Your &#39;contemporary, intelligent and rational&#39;
    brings to mind <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman" target="_blank">Whitman</a>.     Someone
    here mentioned a pairing of Whitman and <a href="http://www.typography.net/type/bliss.htm"
    target="_blank">Bliss</a>, which sounds to me just wonderful. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    know about a serif pairing for Whitney, but no doubt you can get some suggestions
    here.

  body: I found the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/26920.html"
    target="_blank"> thread.</a> It was Kent Lew, designer of Whitman, who pointed
    out that the Virginia Quarterly Review had used this combination, and he was quite
    pleased with it.
