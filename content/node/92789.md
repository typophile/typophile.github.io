  body: Sorry, don't know this type (may be an exclusive typeface). Anyway, it somehow
    reminds of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gautier/maax/|Maax]] (playing with alternates)
    and [[http://swisstypefaces.com/fonts/euclid-bp/euclid-bp-bold/|Euclid]] but that's
    far from being similar...

  body: "[[http://www.lefeusacre-editions.com/catalogue/index.html|Here]] is the publisher's
    website. The graphic designers are [[http://www.studio-vasco.com/|Vasco]], perhaps
    you could ask them about the typeface.\r\n\r\nI would also very much like to know
    the typeface of the body copy, as seen [[http://issuu.com/lefeusacreeditions/docs/lfs002?mode=window&pageNumber=1|here]]."
