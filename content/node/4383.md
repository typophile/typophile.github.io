body: Hello, <BR> <BR>for my final project at university I&#39;m making a &#40;latin&#41;
  typeface that is inspired by the hebrew as well as the arab scripts. What I really
  want to do is to make a typeface that is inspired by two very different and almost
  opposite scripts &#40;though I found there are also a lot of similarities between
  them&#41;. So what I did in the end is that the bottom part of my typeface is arab
  inspired and the upper part is hebrew inspired. I have an example here ... does
  anyone have any suggestions, things that I did that I really shouldn&#39;t do or
  do different ?? All comments are welcome. <BR> <BR>Ine <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/33944.gif"

    east. <BR> <BR>This concept remind me a bit Per Jorgensen typefaces done for FontFont
    couple years ago.

  body: Perhaps the &#34;a&#34; can be improved; It look a bit to constructed and
    large with his middle horizontal line?

  body: 'Wow, what an interesting typeface this is! I really liked your idea of putting
    together &#34;upper-lower&#34; parts of letters from both languages to conceive
    a new face. <BR> <BR>Issues I think you should consider: i&#43;j looks like a
    &#34;y&#34;. the &#34;p&#34; is very courageous, maybe make a subtler version
    of it? <BR> <BR>The false &#34;dagesh dots&#34; that make the &#34;f&#34; and
    the &#34;m&#34; make those letters a bit hard to decypher, I&#39;m trying to think
    of maybe a different way to incorporate them... Maybe consider using a false Arabic
    &#34;hamsa&#34; instead of Hebrew &#34;dagesh&#34;? <BR> <BR>The &#34;e&#34; is
    also a bit harsh for me, but I&#39;m all run out of ideas on this one... :&#62;
    <BR> <BR>Basically that&#39;s a very well-done, innovative study of semitic letterforms.
    I&#39;m very surprised to see it coming all the way from Antwerpen! Good job.'

    BORDER=0> <BR>I agree with Meir on his remarks though. <BR>I think the key for
    solving the weaker letters would be to refare to the direction and dynamics of
    the letter rather than only to its final shape. <BR>The &#39;e&#39; for example
    is a classic case where the mix does resemble the desired shape but the directions
    of the two scripts are opposite, more or less like the political situation here,
    it makes the letter unquite and tense. So to give us more hope of finding a mutual
    language in the middle east &#40;and to further develope your already excelent
    project&#41; try to find a way for the opposite energies to combine towards coexistance.

  body: 'Wow. This is as well-executed as it is fascinating, and sensitive! A font
    might not suddenly cause the warmongers to lay down their arms, but thinking about
    peace can only help. <BR> <BR>This is the only font I&#39;ve seen that combines
    two scripts to convey a third! When I write my book :-&#41; about formal &#34;migrations&#34;
    in writing systems this will definitely be included. And there&#39;s some great
    details that help it avoid being a gimmick &#40;unlike FF Falafel, which I find
    unsatisfying&#41;. Like the way you&#39;ve carried over some phonetic stuff is
    really cool: the &#34;b&#34; has the dot from Arabic baa&#39;, the &#34;p&#34;
    has the triple-dot from the Farsi pe, and the &#34;y&#34; has the double from
    the Arabic yaa&#39;! Very clever. And I like that the &#34;i&#34; has two dots
    to contrast it against the &#34;j&#34;. <BR> <BR>Legibility: there do seem to
    be problems, but I think you want to maintain <i>some</i> ambiguity. <BR> <BR>Stylistically
    the only big problem is the &#34;a&#34;: that thin line isn&#39;t cutting it.
    You can try either using the capital form, or giving the &#34;a&#34; an ascender
    to gain room in the x-height - note that in the &#34;a&#34; the bowl is more important
    than having a strong top. <BR> <BR>I do however see a major &#34;ideological&#34;
    issue: if you really want to make the Hebrew and Arabic equals, it&#39;s not working
    - the former is too strong here. There are some details &#40;like most of the
    terminals&#41; that are pushing the whole too far towards Hebrew. I can thing
    of four things you can try, probably in some combination: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Keep
    the x-height stuff Hebrew-looking, but make the ascenders Arabic &#40;like the
    descenders&#41;. What&#39;s nice about this approach is that Hebrew is essentially
    an &#34;x-height&#34; script while Arabic is the opposite, so it makes perfect
    sense! <BR>2&#41; You&#39;re mixing Hebrew and Arabic style dots. I wouldn&#39;t
    get rid of all of the former &#40;like in the &#34;m&#34; it&#39;s great&#41;,
    but maybe shift the balance a bit to the latter. <BR>3&#41; Add more angularity.
    Especially in the &#34;diagonals&#34;, like u/v/w. This will make it feel like
    some Arabic newspaper fonts, while angularity seems to be much less common in
    Hebrew settings. <BR>4&#41; Those tagin &#40;&#34;crowns&#34;?&#41; are too evocative
    of the torah. I would either remove them, or add some qur&#39;aan marks - there&#39;s
    a whole constellation of them, some very beautiful. But personally I would avoid
    both - after all, you don&#39;t have to be religious to benefit from Hebrew or
    Arabic. <BR> <BR>But please, whatever you do, do finish and release this font!

  body: The only suggestion I could make here - the pointing you&#39;ve built is very
    beautiful; I&#39;d love to see alternates with different &#40;or no&#41; pointing
    in a finished version; it&#39;d allow for really interesting variation in slightly
    longer display texts. &#40;It&#39;d also give you the room for more fancy Torah/Qur&#39;an
    marks.&#41;

  body: thank you for all these positive replies. <BR>I&#39;ve changed the a, though
    i&#39;m still not completely satisfied with it. I also decided to loose the tagins
    for this version, maybe I will also make a version with torah and quran marks,
    but I don&#39;t have any information yet about Quran marks. Are there any websites
    or books about this ? I also agree that the ij-combination looks to much as a
    y, so I made a different i, for this combination. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34536.gif"

  body: Ine, I saw the nice font you did. A great job keeping the two in one font
    with the geace and elegance. <BR>I am sure you have read the comments by now and
    I would add that the Hebrew is too dominant, in shape as well as in direction.
    Being a hebrew speaker, I am tempted to read this RTL which might miss the point,
    right?
