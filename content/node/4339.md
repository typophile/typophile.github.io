  body: I collect script fonts, and this one looks unfamiliar to me. The major problem
    with finding handritten or printed fonts is that they are so easy and cheap to
    make. I will be watching this thread too, in case someone knows this one, but
    I made searches for anything to do with Einstein and typefaces or fonts or handwriting.
    There were no samples clear enough to say that this is even based on his handwriting,
    although this might make you want to suppose  it is. I have also scanned through
    all the everyday handwriting fonts in the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide, Part 9</a> without finding anything much
    like it. I will also check Part 10 &#40;Antique Handwriting&#41; in case I might
    have put it there.

    recognize this, but rather than <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-ruthie/"
    target="_blank">P22 Ruthie</a>, which is very &#39;greeting card-ish&#39; &#40;but
    nice&#41;, I would say this most resembles the new ITC Christoph&#39;s Quill &#40;below&#41;:

    evil, it probably has nothing to do with Einstein and probably is a recent and
    possibly free font. '
