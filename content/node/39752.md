    the pronounciation of the aring in any instance I can think of, and adding the
    acute therefore seems superfluous). '

  body: "Claus: <em>It\u2019s not used in Danish as Hudson claimed in that other thread.</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    character is not <em>normally</em> used in writing Danish, but if syllable stress
    is marked in Danish, as may happen in e.g. dictionaries, then any standard Danish
    vowel, including the A with ring, may take an acute accent. This isn't unusual
    for any Latin script orthography: the acute accent is widely used to mark stress,
    and the only thing that makes the Danish situation a bit more complicated is that
    the A with ring is a standard vowel, not a diacriticised vowel, and hence you
    have the phenomenon of stacked marks that is otherwise not usual in European orthographies
    (but is very common in Africa for example).\r\n\r\nNow, most diacritic stacking
    in Unicode makes use of combining mark character sequences, so letters with two
    marks above are uncommon in the standard. If they exist in Unicode it is a very
    strong indication that they pre-date Unicode in some 8-bit character set, since
    Unicode has a policy of providing one-to-one round-trip mapping for earlier encoding
    standards. My guess is that the Aringacute character probably existed in something
    like a library cataloguing encoding, since these tend to be quite exhaustive in
    their coverage of possible accentuation.\r\n\r\nIf you check the Danish information
    in the <a href=\"http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/danish.pdf\">The Alphabets
    of Europe</a>, you'll see that Aringacute is included there. This document originated
    as a CEN project, and included input from a wide range of national experts and
    standardisation bodies. If you were to check the documents listed in the bibliography,
    I'm sure you would find the justification for Aringacute in one or both.\r\n\r\nWhen
    Microsoft were spec'ing the WGL4 character set, they decided to take an inclusive
    approach to European diacritic letters, even if the characters in question were
    not found in everyday orthographic use. Hence, the Aringacute (along with Oslashacute
    and AEacute, and lowercase equivalents) were all included and, through this, became
    fairly standard inclusions in OpenType glyph sets for European language support.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In Danish typesetter terms the \xE5 is called 'Swedish \xE5'. The character
    was, as it is written today with the ring on top of the a, invented in the 15th
    century in Sweden. In the 14th century the first ways to indicate the o-sounding
    a included \u0101 \u0103 \xE2 and ao written together like \xE6 is. The origin
    of the aring was writing the a with the ring right just to it's right side, later
    in the 15th century it was moved up on top of the a. The first time the \xE5 is
    used in print is in 1526 for a Swedish bible. After a few centuries of mucking
    about with aa versus \xE5, the \xE5 was implemented by law in Danish in 1948."

    see that the Aringacute is not listed, nor is it listed in either of the Norwegian
    orthographies\r\n\r\nhttp://www.evertype.com/alphabets/bokmaal-norwegian.pdf\r\nhttp://www.evertype.com/alphabets/nynorsk-norwegian.pdf\r\n\r\nwhereas
    it is listed here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.evertype.com/alphabets/danish.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
    is a good indication that the Aringacute will be found identified as a Danish
    character in the Danish Language Committee (Dansk sprogn\xE6vn) documents listed
    in the bibliography for the Danish PDF:\r\n\r\nDansk sprogn\xE6vn. 1996. <em>Retskrivningsordbogen.</em>
    2. udgave. K\xF8benhavn: Aschehoug. ISBN 87-11-10000-1\r\n\r\nDansk sprogn\xE6vn,
    in Icelandic Council for Standardization. 1992. <em>Nordic cultural requirements
    on information technology.</em> Reykjav\xEDk: Sta\xF0lar\xE1\xF0 \xCDslands. ISBN
    9979-9004-3-1\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the Wikipedia entry on the Danish alphabet
    has this to say:\r\n\r\n<em>Standard Danish orthography has no compulsory diacritics,
    but allows the use of an acute accent for disambiguation. Most often, an accent
    on e marks a stressed syllable in one of a pair of homographs that have different
    stresses, for example en dreng (a boy) versus \xE9n dreng (one boy) or alle (every/everyone)
    versus all\xE9 (avenue).\r\n\r\nLess often, any vowel except '\xE5' may be accented
    to indicate stress on a word, either to clarify the meaning of the sentence, or
    to ease the reading otherwise. For example: jeg st\xF3d op (\"I was standing\"),
    versus jeg stod \xF3p (\"I got out of bed\"). Most often, however, such distinctions
    are made using typographical emphasis (italics, underlining) or simply left to
    the reader to infer from the context, and the use of accents in such cases may
    appear dated.</em>\r\n\r\nThat explains the use of the acute accent (which is
    similar to the use of optional diacritics in Norwegian), but whoever wrote that
    entry maintains that \xE5 cannot take the accent mark, which is presumably contrary
    to whatever document resulted in the inclusion of Aringacute in ISO 10646 and
    Unicode.\r\n\r\nAnnex G of the CEN document <em>User requirements study and programming
    for standardization in the field of Character Set Technology</em> provides the
    table of contents of the <em>Nordic cultural requirements on information technology</em>
    publication:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.open-std.org/CEN/TC304/docs/pt01-fin.htm\r\n\r\nNote
    that this includes 'Library application', and as I wrote above such use tends
    to be very inclusive of possible accentuation, since library catalogues need to
    be able to accurately represent information from books of different periods, when
    diacritic use may have varied."

    entered Unicode as part of the merger of character sets with ISO 10646, i.e. Unicode
    1.1. U+01FA..U+01FF came in as a set, and presumably from one of the Scandinavian
    national standards bodies, most likely the Danes. Ken also confirms that the characters
    with acute accents, including Aringacute, are listed on page 24 of the <em>Nordic
    Cultural Requirements on Information Technology</em> publication, and are annotated
    in the Danish column as 'Letters seldom used in writing the language'.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick:
    <em>Well, they are the folks that gave smileyface and a cup of coffee their own

    and I believe the 'hot beverage' symbol originated with the Japanese. There's
    this mistaken idea that the Unicode consists of a bunch of people coming up with
    characters to encode, but most of the characters are proposed by other bodies
    or by individual researchers, and the UTC's task is to review and determine whether
    the proposed characters should be encoded and how, and it does so in coordination
    with WG2, the ISO body responsible for 10646. It just happens that most font developers
    come to know the Universal Character Set via Unicode."
