  about something that happened to me.\r\nI am a graduating designer, and I was looking
  for some people to offer my services to.\r\nI came across the company website of
  a family's friend company, and I found it ugly and disturbing.\r\nHere you can see
  some screenshots of the website and the logo. I blurred some parts to make them
  not recognizable, but I think you can get the overall feeling.\r\n\r\nLogo: http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/8654/picture3copy.jpg\r\nHomepage:
  http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/3013/picture2copy.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week we
  met this friend at a dinner, and I kindly offered him the chance to have him redesigning
  / modernizing his website and logo.\r\nShortly, He said stuff like \"the logo must
  rest the same\" and \"I dont need a fancy website - everything the clients need
  is online\".\r\nHe claimed that in his product area, he's the leader, and that,
  again, a \"cool\" website would make no difference in the number of clients that
  would contact him, because, with it being an industrial product which is sold to
  other industries and NOT to customers in supermarkets, they don't need to impress
  people with advertising or marketing strategies, they just need to say what they're
  offering, and since they offer \"the best\" stuff, it's fine for them this way.\r\n\r\nI
  answered that there's no function without good shape and that bad/ugly communication
  (in this case that website) can be more harmful that no communication at all.\r\nAnd
  that a website with a decent color palette and correct and coherent html / css language
  doesn't have to be \"cool\" or \"fancy\" in a negative way but could just be an
  improvement to this situation.\r\n\r\nEnough said, he was not interested.\r\n\r\nSo,
  what would you have said to him?\r\nHave you ever offered your services to clients
  from the factories world?\r\nWhat was their and yours reaction?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "After seeing those screenshots I would say it's not the matter of \"coolness\"
    or \"nice design\" but more of legibility! Black background? Damn.\r\n\r\nAnd
    as for \"offering services\"... I'm young, unexperienced and all, I'm aware of
    that but the one thing I've learnt so far is that when a client does not want
    a change, there's no way to convince him to make a change. In most cases every
    comment that is even slightly negative you make about his/her website/logo/whatever
    is treated like a personal attack. (I'm not saying that's always the case, of
    course)\r\n\r\n- Filip \u0141ysyszyn"
