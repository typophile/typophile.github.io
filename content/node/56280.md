body: 'As a student I am still learning about typography and the units of measurements
  involved. However it has occurred to me that the point is based on the inch, which
  as far as i know is now used exclusively in the United States. I was wondering if
  there was another standardized measurement system for typography based in the metric
  system. So far all of the resources that i have been using have only referred to
  American typography. If someone could give me some insight in this matter or any
  starting points for my research that would be appreciated.   '

    It is now, at 72 points to the inch, but 20 years ago it was 72.27 (approximately)
    points per inch. Computer programmers didn't like the wild value, and rounded
    it down. "
