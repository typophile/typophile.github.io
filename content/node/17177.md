  body: "yay! i found a cached version of [[Christian Robertson]]'s thread for [[Dear
    Sarah]] on Google. Here it is with Christian's OT code hacks intact:\r\n\r\nExcerpt
    of Christian's comments:\r\n\r\n<cite>It's not true randomness. The OT code looks
    something like this:</cite>\r\n\r\n<code>@random_set_1 = [a d g j l m n o c];\r\n@random_set_2
    = [k e i n p q t v z];\r\n@letter = [a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u
    v w x y z];\r\n@letter_alt = [a.alt b.alt c.alt d.alt e.alt f.alt g.alt h.alt
    i.alt j.alt k.alt l.alt m.alt n.alt o.alt p.alt q.alt r.alt s.alt t.alt u.alt
    v.alt w.alt x.alt y.alt z.alt];\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\nsub @random_set_1 @letter
    @letter' by @letter_alt;\r\nsub @random_set_2 @letter @letter' by @letter_alt2;\r\n}
    calt;</code>\r\n\r\n<cite>If you put in enough of these ugly hacks it starts to
    appear random. You would also want to make sure that no two letters were ever
    the same right next to each other. There are only so many of those that happen
    regularly in English, so I have added specific substitution rules for each of
    those cases (ee ff gg ll mm nn oo, etc.) Also notice that I have placed an @letter
    between the @random character. This makes the pattern even more difficult to spot.
    You might notice the funky h after every t, but you wouldn't notice the funky
    h after t-anycharacter, (unless you were freaking crazy).</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>In
    the case of this font, the fact that there are a different set of characters to
    connect to the o b v w also helps the font appear more random. The randomness
    feature above needs to be adjusted to get the connectors right for this one, which
    makes it more complicated. To be honest, I haven't completely figured it out.</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:xsEFmPhUpBIJ:www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34366.html%3F1096994612+dear+sarah+site:typophile.com&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2&client=firefox-a\">Full
    Thread Here</a>\r\n\r\nalso, for a bit of pseudo randomness, i think you could
    combine a couple contextual lookups that do different things. For example, you
    could have 2 sets of letters and have every third one switch to an alternate.
    Then have another lookup that changes double letter combinations so that the second
    letter in the combo gets switched out by its alternate. the interplay of these
    two functions will give a predictable, but somewhat random appearing effect. this
    is just one example, there are probably endless ways of combining effects such
    as this to get something that approaches randomness."
