  usually add 5mm-10mm on the inside margin to compensate for this but does anyone
  have any typographic rules of thumb? Always handy!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    dummy for you.

    should be n*x, where n is the paper thickness and x is the order of the spread
    in relation to the inner one.\r\n\r\nFun aside \u2014 any printer worth his/her
    salt will have impo-software that compensates automatically. \r\nNot something
    a designer has to worry about."

  body: "Or find a published book with similar trim size, page count, paper stock,
    and binding method and use it as a poor-man\u2019s bound dummy.\r\n\r\nTake a
    print-out of your sample page, trim off a little extra along the gutter margin,
    and insert the page so that the fore-edge is flush. Then note where your inside
    margin appears to fall. Adjust to taste. When it looks good, it is good.\r\n\r\n"

  body: You have to talk to your printer about this (assuming you are having it printed,
    and this isn't a one-off laser job). It will depend on how the job is printed,
    folded, and imposed. The rule that one printer gives you (or that you get on a
    discussion board) will be completely wrong for another printer using different
    equipment and methods.

  body: "Kent\u2019s answer is correct. I\u2019ve used that technique and it works.
    In that case I asked the printer for a sample of a book they printed to similar
    specs. \r\n\r\nOn layout issues, be cautious about taking your printer\u2019s
    advice. If the book comes back with layout problems, you\u2019ll get blamed anyways.
