  body: I like the first 'ft' ligature, and then the third. The second one isn't doing
    it for me because the horizontal join looks too clunky.

    you just let the \u2018ft\u2019 ligate at the crossbar and leave the tops unconnected?
    If you add a ball terminal to the \u2018f,\u2019 it will mirror your \u2018it\u2019
    ligature and give the logo some lift, instead of keeping it all closed in."

  body: "caled/brettr/riccardo = thanks! I agree that the second one feels way too
    heavy.\r\n\r\nkentlew = of course! I liked the weight of the last one but was
    worried that the 'f' was lost and you are absolutely right...I turned it into
    list. (Though, that's actually interesting conceptually...list would be an equally
    appropriate term for the product). \r\n\r\nI think you're spot on with the ball
    terminal on the f. Makes it legible and adds a bit of symmetry. I'll work on that
    next!"

    I've adjusted the spacing and the 't' and narrowed the L a bit more. \r\n\r\nAs

    etc, and then access this information while they are writing. \r\n\r\nhttp://litlift.com/\r\n\r\nThere's
    going to be a mark as well (included below).\r\n\r\nFinally, I made an adjusted

    ascender on the final t should not be curved on the left.\r\nThese are shapes
    informed by the broad pen, so it would be wise to structure them accordingly.\r\nAlso,
    there is no necessity to make the ball of the f the same size as the tittle, it
    might be better smaller, allowing more room for the ascender of t.\r\nAt any rate,
    the open tittle looks too small compared to the ligatured tittle."

    seem to make or break the logo, either.\r\n\r\nNick...thanks for the feedback.
    I made a couple more tweaks (2nd and 3rd below). I do like the straighter shared
    crossbar. I tried removing the t's curve on the ascender but it feels a bit awkward,
    IMHO. I'm leaning towards the middle option. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ligaturehelp7_4878.jpg]"

  body: "I also think the middle one is the best, however the last one is a close
    second though.\r\n\r\nReason I think the middle one is the best is because the
    the \"t\" flows within the ligature, as if the top was almost a holster for the
    ball terminal of the \"f\".  The \"t\" on the last one seems out of style with
    the rest of the glyphs, and because there is another \"t\" in the logo, people
    might compare the two for differences making them focus on a perceptional error
    instead of the cleverness of your design.\r\n\r\nIt's looking real good!"

  body: I quite like the middle design. Seems to flow nicely as a whole. One issue
    is possible the join between the f and t. As it is the only 2 letters joined makes
    it look a tad odd, might just be me though.

    terminal of the f might come a little close to the ascender of the t at smaller
    sizes. A very nice mark."
