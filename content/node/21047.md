body: At Washington's National Gallery I came across this beautiful letter press poster
  for the museum's Dada exhibition.  I'm curious about the historic accuracy of the
  type used. Thanks!

    time. However, this look a lot like they might have used <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/champion/index.html\">Champion</a>
    from Hoelfer & Frere-Jones with some manipulation. \r\n\r\n[I'm going to move
    the to the Type ID area to see if others agree.]"

    body: "Yee Haw Industries recently gave a great talk for AIGA Raleigh. They brought
      with them a locked up chase for an announcement that used all original (19th/20thc)
      wood and lead type, and hundreds of limited edition ephemera printed from wood
      type or wood engravings. (Very cool stuff).\r\n\r\nThey have one of the most
      extensive collections of wood type in the U.S. and, while designers/printers
      Julie Belcher and Kevin Bradley often draw images and type, the work is clearly
      of their hand. I have a large wall menu (4 ft. x 5 ft.) they designed and printed
      packed solid with various widths and heights of beautifully aged sans serif
      wood types, similar to the fonts Jonathan was probably looking at when he designed
      the Champion family. So I would guess the letterforms are \"authentic\" and
      not digitized, which adds to the poster's quality.\r\n\r\nOf course, the design
      is a translation of the DaDa sensibility by the designers. If you haven't seen
      much of their work, visit http://www.yeehawindustries.com/new/home.html. Enjoy!"

  body: "kevin/julie-yee-haw industrial letterpress: \r\nhi y'all, typography on the
    large dada print from the national gallery exhibition,\r\nthe wood type is gothic,
    (20 pica-black type) up to (70 & 90 pica-red,) hamilton type foundry from the
    1860's. no computer involved,  no manipulation of the font, hand pulled straight
    from the wood blocks. we also did 2 dada posters, a small dodger of hugo ball
    poem - with some amazingly beautiful small metal type, 4 greeting cards, one-of-a-kind
    journals with typography covers and some mini card packs. I don't have any of
    these on our web site yet - as they were exclusive to the national gallery for
    the duration of the show... but very soon.\r\n"
