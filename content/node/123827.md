body: Hello, I'm looking for a sans-serif font with a lot of stylistic alternates
  similar to what [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/features/whitney-stylistic-sets|Whitney]]
  and [[http://mbtype.com/pdf/concourse-type-specimen.pdf|Concourse]] have. For example
  so you can swap out the default glyphs for single-story a, more humanist or more
  geometric t and M. I was thinking about going with Concourse because price/licensing
  are both good, but thought I'd look at alternative options. Any ideas? As those
  examples suggest I'm looking for a quite neutral design with a range of weights,
  suitable for body text or display. A condensed width and small caps would be nice.

  body: "Sense and Sensibility\r\nNeology Deco and Neology Grotesque\r\n\r\nHaving
    invested a considerable amount of time in drawing alternates for most of the alphabet
    in these, I\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t summon the commitment to do condensed
    and small caps as well! And the Neology has no italic. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is
    always possible to do a good faux by using the stroke command, coupled with a
    little extra tracking and perhaps a touch of horizontal scaling. And there may
    be some instances where the next weight up can be used as a small cap.\r\n\r\nHypatia
