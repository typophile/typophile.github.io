  concern fonts - what on earth am I doing here then !? - but just a young fellow
  willing to learn from experience.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find new ways - or at least
  different from the ones I know :) - to generate an image (Server-side) from a text
  sample. So far, using PHP and GD library - ah, basics - has been working pretty
  well for me. But when it comes to ligatures or alternates, GD hasn't been very helpful
  so far. This is where I hope to benefit from everyone's incredible experience :)
  I have been asking the same question on more \"specific\" general forums, but with
  fonts being such a particular topic, I'm pretty sure I'll get more success here
  than anywhere else - like always !\r\n\r\nLearning new programming languages isn't
  really a problem, as I'm always curious. So if anyone has any suggestion, I'd love
  to hear it :)\r\n\r\nThank you all for having taken the time to read my modest request,
  and thank you for your help,\r\n\r\nFrederic"

    that would probably mean doing swaps before you submit the text string to the
    rendering machine, perhaps something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>IF font has character
    UFB01;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>AND text string has contiguous characters /fi/;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>THEN
    swap UFB01 for /fi/ in text string before rendering;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>ELSE
    ignore.</code>\r\n\r\nFor alternates, until a uniform standard for designation
    and Unicode assignment is developed, you're on you're own\u2026"

    as far as I know, GD uses FreeType to handle the text rendering. So, depending
    on FreeType''s capabilities, it may be possible to come up with some deep wizardry
    to toss in alternates on the fly.'

  body: "Thanks to everyone for your answers. I apologize about the late reply, the
    week-end has been pretty busy around here.\r\n\r\nNick, you actually managed to
    read my mind :) Manual replacement in a text string was my first idea too, and
    I also got stuck when it came to not having a Unicode value. And then I have absolutely
    no idea how to display these alternates/ligatures :(\r\n\r\nReynir, you're absolutely
    right about GD. Though, as far as I know, FreeType doesn't display ligatures or
    alternates, does it ? Of course, I might be wrong, but here's what I found in
    the FreeType documentation :\r\n\r\n<em>\"The library doesn't support text layout
    operations. Sophisticated features like glyph substitution, positioning (kerning),
    justification, bi-directional ordering, etc.m are not part of a font service in
    itself. They must be handled one level higher.\"</em>\r\n\r\nI just love the last
    sentence <em>\"They must be handled one level higher\"</em>. I still don't get
    what \"one lever higher\" means :)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have found ways to
    do this with the Python language, so I'm keeping this solution somewhere in my
    mind for the future, if I don't find another way to do this :)\r\n\r\nI have also
    done some reading during the last two days and bookmarked a few links for me to
    read. These links concern PHP libraries, so as soon as I'll be done with them,
    I'll see if it is what I'm looking for."

    contains routines to draw entire text strings (and thus limited to regular Unicode);
    but these are wrappers around its Core Business: drawing any arbitrary <em>glyph</em>
    from any font on any position.\r\n\r\nIf you can figure out how to use the Draw
    Any Glyph function, you can pretty much draw any text, with all ligatures, small
    caps, accents, and whatever you can find in a font. The big drawback is that you
    need to follow the Opentype rules: do substitutions in the correct order, handle
    GPOS custom positioning (which includes, but is by no way limited to, advanced
    kerning), as well as handle all idiosyncratic inherent behavior of Opentype features
    (e.g., determine what a \"beginning of word\" character is and then look up if
    there is an \"init\" feature to be applied).\r\n\r\nI've never used it myself,
    but word on the streets is <strong>Harfbuzz</strong> is an intermediate text engine,
    sitting between Freetype and your own code to handle most OTF features."

  body: "Theunis, to be absolutely honest, I'm not sure I completely understand what
    you are kindly trying to explain - the problem is definitely on my side though,
    when it comes to \"technical\" english :) And to continue with the honesty, I
    think I kinda rushed into this as I see many, many things I don't understand yet.\r\n\r\nSo
    let me try to sum this up :\r\n\r\n- If I understand your two first paragraphs
    well, you mean that even if FreeType doesn't do automatic glyph substitution,
    it still could do it if it's told to do so ? This is a first problem to me : I
    have no idea how to even start to do so. You're giving me very good directions,
    but the main problem I see is \"how to do the substitutions ?\".\r\n\r\nI have
    checked many links about Harfbuzz and it seems very promising. Although I didn't
    manage to make it work so far. Neither did I manage to make Pango work so far.
    But this is a classic case of PEBKAC, as I'm really not good enough to understand
    this at the moment. Following guidelines was easy, now it's time to make my brain
    explode with a lot of things. I'd love to actually learn how to make these two
    things work, but following the documentation I have found wasn't a success so
    far.\r\n\r\nI think I have to do this one step at a time. Otherwise, I might have
    the temptation to give up before being even close to understanding everything,
    as this is veeeery fuzzy in my mind. I wouldn't even know where to start, to be
    honest, as this seems to be such a wide area to explore."

  body: "It's a question of functional layering. Here is an infographic, hope this
    makes it a bit more clear.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drawtype_6318.png]\r\n\r\n<em>FreeType</em>
    is best at drawing glyphs (both Unicode encoded and un-encoded), but you have
    to tell it what glyphs to draw and where. It only uses the outline part of an
    OpenType font.\r\n<em>HarfBuzz</em> can look up the correct glyph sequence to
    be displayed from a font, given a string of characters to draw and a set of Opentype
    features to apply.\r\n<em>Pango</em> integrates the two: you tell it what text
    to draw with what features applied.\r\n\r\nIt totally depends on how far you want
    to go. Typically, you would use only FreeType if all you want to show is a simple
    list of all glyphs in a font (I used it to write my own quick-and-dirty font inspector).\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to see Opentype features in action, you could read the data yourself
    out of the font and \"apply\" it (i.e., performing the right lookups for the character(s)
    you want to display and the features it should show), or use HarfBuzz, which --
    as I understand -- does the looking up and translating to other glyphs for you.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want a fully featured text drawing engine, you need to take 'everything' into
    account -- Opentype features, kerning, and even font switching to do stuff like
    display an italic word in a regular string. That's what Pango can do for you."

  body: "Theunis, I will never thank you enough for the time you're taking to make
    this more clear to me.\r\n\r\nYour infographic has been very useful to me, thank
    you very very much ! \r\n\r\nIf I understand well, Pango seems to be the most
    interesting solution for me so far. What I'm looking for is, for example, a way
    to write a regular text in a form, then show an image with this text with ligatures/alternates
    included. I'll focus my efforts on learning more about Pango from now on - and
    the first one will be to understand how to use it :)\r\n\r\nBut then, I feel a
    little confused about the part on FreeType. If I still understand well - correct
    me if I'm wrong - you're saying FreeType can display ligatures or alternates if
    it's told to do so ? But then, the question would be how do I tell it to do so
    ? I always thought like this : 1. Give a text string, 2. The environment gets
    the text string, displays the text with ligatures/alternates, 3. Save as an image.
    Could I still do it with GD - so this would mean I was wrong in the first place
    ? \r\n\r\nIf I want to replace, let's say a regular \"a\" with an \"alternate
    a\", I think I have to find out how to call that \"alternate a\" to make the replacement
    ?"

  body: "If you are going to use Pango, I presume you can instruct it to do so ...
    I don't think it would be necessary to \"manually\" insert FreeType commands.\r\n\r\nSo
    when using Pango, don't worry about the other libraries. That's the advantage
    of layered software: everything 'below' the level you are using ought not to concern
    you (unless, of course, you want to do something that the higher level library
    doesn't support)."
