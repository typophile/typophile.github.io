If this is going to be a fleet graphic, then it will have a different look and feel untill you actually see it that large, so I guess it's hard to say. <BR> <BR>I think the colours work well, they are good and consistent with that industry, ie. road signage, warehouse signage etc&hellip; <BR> <BR>I'm not sure, if, at another level, the 'cutout' in the truck is sending a positive message <BR> <BR>Those are just some of my initial thoughts, I hope  they didn't come across too negative</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the truck, sans drop shadow looks much better and the smaller cutout/counter looks great as well, I hacked together a couple of other layouts you might want explore but yours looks good as is. For the spacing between the letters in  TRUCKING, I'm guessing you chose to go with the stroke width in CALHOUN. You can also try to align the truck and 'trucking', as in, make them the same width and cut on the same angled guide. Orange looks great, nice <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52500.gif" alt="calhoun_logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">i like the truck icon, however, as said, the hole in the truck could represent something negative.  the style seems to flow nicely with the truck industry, and i think you should stay somewhere in that region.  if you stray to far design-wise, people won't like it and will not associate it with trucking. <BR> <BR>i think the rigid truck icon is a good direction&ndash;a hand-drawn approach would not be strong enough. <BR> <BR>the gaps in the first few letters of CALHOUN bother me&hellip; i mean, i wish there were gaps in the last 4 letters as well.  it's so tight around the HOUN.  also, i think the letters should be altered to have a more unique quality.  and i would try them non-oblique.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone for their advice. I should have said more about what I am going for. The big thing with this logo was I wanted the icon to be strong, reliable, but fast. I realize the icon was rigid, so I have made modifications. I think it is greatly improved! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52598.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>Something bothered me about the icon before I posted it Sunday. I didn't have the same confident feeling I normaly do about my logos, but I have to stay with the general idea of the c in the truck. When I initially sat down with the client I started sketching and playing while I waited for him to arrive. He saw the sketches and just loved the idea.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52599.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Randy- they are large trucks. I also should have stated that in the beginning. On this icon I didn't want to get too specific on the truck since I don't want the logo to get too outdated. I didn't even want to use a truck in the beginning, but the client wanted that. My original idea was to use a bull as the icon. I don't like directly using the subject in the logo (usually). <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52600.jpg" alt=""> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52601.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Scott- I have tried to make it less rigid. Also, I presented them with more illustrative, softer sketches. He and his wife were more interested in the bulkier sharper idea. Below is one of the sketches I showed him. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52602.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I would love to have further criticism on my new version. Let me know if the negative space is still a problem. The space in the middle still bothers me, but not as much. I agree that it could be negative, but does the new logo help that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I must agree with darrel. I don't think immediacy of reading a &quot;C&quot; is very significant. <BR> <BR>What I find so powerful in the second version of the mark (the first orange version) is the fundamental meaning of trucking company you have managed to capture so simply and powerfully. The line leading to the inner counter space suggests the idea or path of loading things into the truck, and then the space inside&ndash;while roomy enough&ndash;is secured by solid walls. Very much like the dynamics the Chase logo is playing with. Inviting but also secure.  <BR> <BR>Then you create this powerful sense of motion allowing a line of space to cut through the truck, emphasizing the urgency/importance of delivering with speed. You really nailed the essence of trucking: security + speed. It's stunning really. <BR> <BR>The newer versions of the truck not only loses the sense of security within the hold, but the horizontal rush dissolves with the upward curve of the line. <BR> <BR>I would try going back to the first orange C truck and replacing the wheel line with the word &quot;Calhoun.&quot; You will retain the horizontal line in the space between the mark and the letterforms, and it could ultimately resolve the relation between the mark and the logotype.  This also reduces the elements you are asking people to interact with. <BR> <BR>I understand shying away from the subject as logo, and I acknowledge the worry of truck image on truck redundancy, but I think your symbol moves far enough from the world of illustration to not feel awkward (especially without wheels).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your perspective truck sketch looks much nicer than the vector versions. I don't think that making the C so obvious is the best way to go. In your sketch it is less obvious and this looks better in my opinion. I think that in general people like to discover hidden meaning, and in the case of the C shaped container on the truck it would also look better visually if it was shown like the sketch.  <BR> <BR> Type style you choose works well for subject matter.</div>
