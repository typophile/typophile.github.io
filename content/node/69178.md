    with @font-face.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect, yes. font-style and font-weight are
    supported quite well. But in a different way than is proposed in the CSS3 spec.
    (In short, certain data must be congruent with the style and weight values in
    the @font-face declarations. Frankly, in some ways it is a more sure-footed system
    than what exists in the CSS3 proposal.)\r\n\r\nAs the co-creator of <a href=\"http://eotfast.com\">EOTFAST</a>
    I've had a bit of leg up on this because I was able to create compressed EOT files
    very quickly and easily and therefore test quickly and easily.\r\nSee the documentation
    for EOTFAST for more details on this.\r\nIn fact, I'm proposing to deliver a paper
    on preparing fonts for IE 6, 7, and 8 at Atypi in Dublin later this year.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    here is a <a href=\"http://readableweb.com/fontface/sc/droidfamilytest.htm\">test
    page</a> with a complete font-family declared and, in IE, you'll see the regular,
    italic, bold, and bold italic faces appearing just as they should.\r\nA more complicated
    page, featuring a wide variety of fonts in different weights and styles is here:\r\n<a
    href=\"http://readableweb.com/fontface/tenfree/tengreat.htm\">Ten Great Free Fonts
    Cross Browser</a>. (Informal notes on what was done to prepare the fonts are at
    the bottom of the page.)\r\n\r\nTip: There seems to be much blind ideological
    hatred of Microsoft and Internet Explorer. There is also a point of view that
    would like to see widespread use of @font-face postponed for as long as possible.\r\nUnfortunately,
    in an effort to drive both agendas, it's gotten to the point where misleading
    statements like, \"IE does not support style linking in connection with @font-face\"
    are being made even by those who know it's inaccurate.\r\n\r\nRich"

    for EOT will be the same as for normal fonts (at least with respect to those records
    intended for MS apps).\r\n\r\nRichard: I don't see any information beyond what
    Si said but your demos are interesting nevertheless. That Kaffeesatz example with
    four weights is obviously with a workaround trick, does it make sense? I would
    definitely not do it this way."

    four styles\" in this context?\r\nCSS allows only two values for font-style. Normal
    or italic(or oblique).\r\nNumeric values for font-weight aside, are the four you
    are referring to the four produced by the combination of font-style and <em>font-weight</em>
    which has \"bold\" and \"normal\"?\r\nSo that the two combined like this will
    have IE apply the bold italic, or bold...\r\n\r\nFor Bold:\r\nfont-weight:bold;\r\nfont-style:normal;\r\n\r\nFor
    Bold Italic:\r\nfont-weight:bold;\r\nfont-style:italic;\r\n\r\nPlease explain.\r\n\r\n@tim
    ahrens\r\nThe CSS for the \"Ten Great Free\" page was taken exactly from the original
    page which used \"raw\" TTF and OTF fonts only and so did not display in IE.\r\nThe
    point of the page is to show that, as long as the fonts are appropriately prepared,
    exactly the same CSS will work cross-browser.\r\nYes, the way the font families
    are declared is quite strange, but that's the way it was done, I just preserved
    it.\r\n\r\n<em>Looks like the style linking strategy for EOT will be the same
    as for normal fonts (at least with respect to those records intended for MS apps).</em>\r\n\r\nNot
    quite sure what this means without seeing the match-up between the CSS and the
    fonts.\r\n\r\nThe PDF documentation that accompanies <a href=\"http://eotfast.com\">EOTFAST</a>
    might help some, too.\r\n\r\nRich"
