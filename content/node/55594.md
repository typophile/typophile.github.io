  kerning etc. In fact, this is the first time that I'm designing a business card...
  \r\n\r\nThanks for any input in this matter.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vcard_6537.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Typedog,\r\n\r\nNo, I haven't printed it out because my printer may well
    run out of ink half the way through ;-)\r\n\r\nDo you think it's necessary to
    do that? I'm entirely new to print design, have mostly done web design before.
    I designed the vcard in CMYK mode in Photoshop so I reckon it should come out
    ok on paper?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign Hamburg]]"

  body: "Greetings Tintin81!\r\n\r\nYes indeed it is, you do not want to have a suprise
    when it\r\nis time to print. I was taught to do it in black and white first\r\nand
    then move onto color. Print can be a hassle sometimes because\r\nwhat you see
    on the screen is not what you will get on paper.\r\nGood look!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrizmo+Design\r\nNo
