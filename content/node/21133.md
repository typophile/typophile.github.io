  I just want to question why it is there are so many different [[typeface classification
  schemes|methods for classifying type]]. I can appreciate [[Robert Bringhurst|Bringhurst]],
  when he eloquently states that it is not yet like the taxonomic classification of
  animals, yet, he also clearly relates the latin letter to an \"animal\" itself.
  The system utilized in his book is based on \"periods\" where as others seem to
  \"fabricate\" terminology such as geralde and transitional for their own proprietary
  classification systems.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I would side with Bringhurst, and say
  forget the rest of the terms that I have already learned, but, what is really the
  best system here, and which is more widely used and understood? I doubt that if
  I were to go back to my professors and speak of neoclassical, baroque, or rococo
  types, that they would have the slightest clue as to just what that meant. I come
  from a university that used the \"fabricated\" system, which also seems to be used
  in most of my other typography books, including Walter Tracy's \"Letters of Credit\".
  I think it's just ironic to have two of the three triumvirate books in complete
  disagreement over which system to use for classification. One would surely be better
  then multiple, overlapping methods.\r\n\r\np.s.\u2014 Why is it that we say Gutenberg
  invented movable type (or at least most people say that) when in fact it existed
  almost 400 years before Gutenberg in China by B\xED Sh\u0113ng?"

  body: 'I like Bringhurst''s classification, but his "baroque" is a bit of a catch-all.
    There are at least four strands within baroque type: some maintains the French
    Renaissance tradition (like Van Dijk''s), some moves towards concentrated force
    (like Kis''s), some towards distortion (like Jannon''s) and some is rococo (like
    Rosart''s and Fleischman''s).'

  body: "Different systems of classification have different guiding principles. No
    one system is 'ideal'. It is just a matter of what your purpose or interest is.
    \r\n\r\nThat being said, there is some soundness in an historical approach, since
    most type designs, as all kinds of design, are influenced by reaction to designs
    of the previous generation, as well as new technology. \r\n\r\nGuttenberg invented
    a system using metal type and oil-based ink, and a press. The Chinese and Korean
    systems it seems used water-based ink, and rubbing. According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type\">Wikipedia
    article</a> it was less suited to mass production. That article credits Guttenberg
    with the press, not the invention of moveable type. The study of any invention
    usually shows that the key inventor was in fact key, but there were a lot of precursors
    that he draws on. That seems to be the case here. The fact is that all mass printing
    has followed Guttenberg's method, until offset printing with photo type, then
    digital type, replaced it.    "

    don't fit neatly into categories, but we put them there as a way of defining them
    for ourselves so we can talk about them. I teach typography and I would find it
    much more difficult if I could not generalize about styles of type even if typefaces
    don't neatly fit into particular styles.\r\n\r\nYou have to look at every system
    of classification and be able to move back and forth amongst them. The Baroque-Romantic
    of Bringhurst helps define certain aspects of historical types, but in the end
    it's only a way of talking about the characteristics of the types, not a way of
    separating them from one another.\r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad because I had no

    needs clarification. Some say the \"form\" was metal, others say the \"form\"
    was wood. The Gutenberg Bible was not PRINTED from \"movable type\" (dictionary
    definition), either in wood or metal. (Hint\u2014early stereos) Although, setting
    the type may have been movable either in wood or metal but\u2014not\u2014printed\u2014from\u2014it.
    I know this is confusing.\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that Koster's work predates
    Gutenberg, Koster's work appears to have been printed from movable type. I would

    and by designer. Therein lies the answer: that it is the purpose of classification
    or juxtapostion which determines the ideal system. To my mind, the systems complement
    rather than disagree, and having read Bringhurst first I was happy to read something
    different, rather than more of the same."

  body: "Hi Matthew\r\n\r\n<cite>what is really the best system here, and which is
    more widely used and understood?</cite>\r\n\r\nPart of my MA research last year
    involved a survey of different schemes for type classification; after hitting
    at least two dozen different schemes I realised that I was working towards a classification
    of classifications... but as Walter Tracy says in Letters of Credit, <cite>...any
    classification is simply an aid to study, not an end in itself. Once the student
    has got the characteristics of the groups firmly in mind and can 'place' any type
    face without difficulty the actual names of the groups, and their precision and
    logicality [or lack of it] cease to be important.</cite>\r\n\r\nGeorge and William
    rightfully point out that these differing systems are complimentary rather than
    exclusive; from where I'm sitting, the old Vox-based system (garalde, transitional,
    modern et al), although now woefully out of date, is perhaps still the most widely
    used and understood. Its chief advantage at the time of its inception (1967, BS
    2961) was that the nomenclature was roughly equivalent in French, English and
    German standards. It also serves to remind us that until the 19th century, there
    was only a pressing need to identify the 'old face' from the 'modern' \u2013 and
    maybe something inbetween, ie, a 'transitional'.\r\n\r\nBringhursts classification
    is elegant and has a good rationale, but as you say, it's not readily translatable
    to the (old?) professors, and as George H points out, it is not entirely flawless.
    The work done by Catherine Dixon that Tim cites at the St Brides conference is
    very interesting, quite complicated and seeks to redress some of the bias evident
    in older classification schemes. However, that 'Typeform Dialogues' project is
    not yet published in its own right, one can only find out more by reading the
    coverage of it in Baines and Haslams \t<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0823055280/qid=1152448748/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-1701602-4475220?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\">Type
    and Typography.</a>\r\n\r\nBoth of these newer initiatives may be better in terms
    of addressing the current complexity of typeface classification, now that there
    are simply so many more typefaces and kinds of typefaces to choose from. I also
    teach typography, but whether one is in class or in a busy commercial studio,
    frankly any kind of system is better than a default font directory listing A-Z.
    Having said that, I no longer believe that there is likely to be a single 'best'
    scheme for classifying typefaces."

    China by B\xED Sh\u0113ng?</em>\r\n\r\nDifferent people can independently invent
    similar processes at different times and places, and it is true to say they both
    invented these things. Saying that Gutenberg invented moveable type doesn't imply
    that B\xED Sh\u0113ng didn't, or vice versa. It is generally acknowledged by anyone
    who knows anything about the history of printing that the Chinese use of moveable
    type preceded the European, but invented does not automatically mean invented
    <em>first.</em> At some time in our childhood, most of us invent something that
    has already been invented by someone else. My niece invented pre-cut spaghetti
    a few years ago. :)\r\n\r\nThe other reason we say that Gutenberg invented moveable
    type, without making a corresponding reference to the Chinese invention, is that
    it is Gutenberg's invention, not B\xED Sh\u0113ng's, which led to the development
    of European typography as we know it and practice it. The invention of moveable
    type in China is an interesting historical fact, but of no direct significance
    for westerners; the invention of moveable type in Mainz is a major cultural event
    that affected pretty much all subsequent western history.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerald, pretty
    much all scholars -- including Dutch ones -- discredit the Koster claim."

  body: "Throughout the history of print, it has been debated as to who developed
    the first system of movable type and the production of the first typographic book.
    We know that in the early 12th century scribes produced books. The Italians were
    experimenting with silver plate engraving and block printing, possibly before
    1400, producing manuscripts with wood block print. Evidence exists to support
    the theory that Gutenberg did produce the first typographic book and develop the
    technology that allowed this to be possible.\r\n\r\nWe know that he perfected
    the technique of moveable block type. We also know that he made great advancements
    in the technology of the press. There is evidence to support this in transcipts
    from his trial with his two business partners, Dritzhen and Hellmann.\r\n\r\nThe
    process of Gutenberg\u2019s creation of type was derived from the defects of wood
    block printing. Since the wood absorbed the ink it was necessary to invent a substrate
    that would be soft enough to press the letter forms but strong enough to withstand
    multiple press runs. Gutenberg developed a type material that was 80% lead, 5%
    tin and 15% antimony; the metal type was moveable and reusable. The process for
    creating the letters was first to select the letter style. Then each character
    had to be engraved into a steal bar to make the punch. The letters including all
    capitals, lowercase, punctuation symbols and ligatures.  The punch was then pressed
    into the metal material to make a negative impression of the type. Gutenberg also
    invented the type mold. The mold allowed each letter to be placed into the mold
    and allowed for the thin or wide letters such as \u201Cl\u201D or \u201Cw\u201D.\r\n\r\nSo
    just as it was said before that we credit Columbus with discovering America, we
    can definantly understand why we credit Gutenberg with movable type. However,
    his greatest invention was not the movable type but creating a cohesive system
    that is one of the greatest achievements in type history."

    for the development and perfection of moveable metal type in the first half of
    the 13th century during the Buddhist Goryeo dynasty. The Koreans printed the entire
    Buddhist canon, which was then exported to China and was largely responsible for
    the preservation of the Buddhist texts there. Some of these texts are extent in
    good condition and are fine examples of the art of printing. (The Koreans also
    made significant improvements in paper and ink technology.) Because there was
    more East-West interchange than has traditionally been acknowledged, I''m not
    ready to say that word of this achievement did not percolate back to Europe --
    after all, the Mongol empire (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire) had
    direct contact with both Korea and Europe. Korean wood and metal printing was
    in part a response to Mongol invasion. '
