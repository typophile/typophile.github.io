At my opinion, the first DB would be the one to have more chance to go somewhere, depend of course of your activity sector.  The second, the third and the fifth remind me a bowling bowl. I suggest to work on the middle terminal of the B (center join), seems to sharp. Also, you could rotate the D to the right or to the left to get something like a diamond or lozenge. Thoses one with a drop shadow could give you a hard time to keep the white hairline clear at small size. <BR> <BR>Andr</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Usually a logo will symbolizes or represents something about the given company for which it stands for. I am just wondering what the logo you have designed stands for. If it is purely for looks than I can't help you. If there is meaning behind it, than it will be  easier to critique. In my personal opinion the better logos out there reflect something about the personality and meaning behind the particular company for which they stand for. <BR>Anyway, only an opinion.</div>

It should represent the entity that it is being designed for. <BR> <BR>In Dragan's defense, this logo's purpose is to represent his design business, possibly, but not necessarily,  in a way that reflects his design style; hence, it is successful in that it is his initials (representing his business just as well as any business that is represented by names or initials) and it is designed by him (must show his style). I think his concept is solid, so it is his execution that will determine whether or not this is a successful logo in the end. <BR> <BR>Your concept in post 6 looks like a bed's footboard on its side. Of the concepts in the last post (7), I like the direction on the bottom, but now (your going to kill me for this) it's a little too subtle. Rather than reading a &quot;B&quot;, I'm seeing a big pimple or mosquito bite. Try bringing back a little more of the stroke in that area so that the bump isn't so abrupt. Also, the terminal is a little too rounded. I think there's a good shape in there, it's just hiding in between a couple of your executions. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

It should represent the entity that it is being designed for. <BR> <BR>In Dragan's defense, this logo's purpose is to represent his design business, possibly, but not necessarily,  in a way that reflects his design style; hence, it is successful in that it is his initials (representing his business just as well as any business that is represented by names or initials) and it is designed by him (must show his style). I think his concept is solid, so it is his execution that will determine whether or not this is a successful logo in the end. <BR> <BR>Your concept in post 6 looks like a bed's footboard on its side. Of the concepts in the last post (7), I like the direction on the bottom, but now (your going to kill me for this) it's a little too subtle. Rather than reading a &quot;B&quot;, I'm seeing a big pimple or mosquito bite. Try bringing back a little more of the stroke in that area so that the bump isn't so abrupt. Also, the terminal is a little too rounded. I think there's a good shape in there, it's just hiding in between a couple of your executions. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You could theoretically combine a &quot;d&quot; and a &quot;b&quot; all day long in a million different ways.  Which way is the right way? <BR>I ask myself  simple question about the logos presented here.  <BR> <BR>How do these logos visually represent that you are a graphic designer? <BR> <BR>To Darrel; <BR>Don't you think a logo is more memorable if it has some underlying metaphor or meaning in it? I'm not talking about a literal meaning like you mentioned. I am talking more simplified, timeless and abstract. <BR> <BR>Here comes my sobering point of the day. <BR>Graphic design firms with logos are limiting themselves. Why would you design a logo for a logo designing company? This might be to heady to talk about on this forum. Look at the logos of some the greatest design firms in the world. You will find that there is nothing tricky or contrived or forced about any of them. In fact, they have a certain consistency about them for a simple reason. They do to many different tasks as design firms to try and represent themselves with a single mark. Most of there logos are more like logotypes that just read simply and smoothly , no bells and whistles man. <BR>  <BR>Again&hellip;only my opinion.</div>
