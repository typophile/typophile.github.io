  conference that publishes a book (perhaps specimen book) of their conference. It
  seems that I stumbled upon it once, but failed to book mark it. What I remember
  is that the 2009 book was no longer available but the 2008 book was or vice versa.
  Any help or leads would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nwas thinking something from
  typecon, but cannot confirm.\r\n\r\nTbird"

  body: thanks for the reply, but that's not them. this was available for like a $20-100$
    purchase, but is sold out because it's very sought after book as only so many
    are printed.
