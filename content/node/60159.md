  designing some graduate certificates, merits and excellence certificates for an
  arts college here in israel.\r\nthey asked me to design matching certificates in
  english,\r\nso i'm looking for a good, clean, very light sans serif latin font match
  for the letters attached i have designed.\r\nsomething which is respectable and
  sharp, not too machine-like. something which reminds the general style of helvetica,
  but is not helvetica.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\nYaronimus."

    Its a clean, sharp sans that isn't too mechanical. It might suit your needs. <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/\">Geogrotesque</a> might
    be an option as well.\r\n\r\nJeo."

  body: "ahalan ahi!!\r\nthank you very much for the help.\r\nis there any type from
    linotype's sans serif page that might suit and resemble the \"section\" type you
    offered?\r\n\r\ni think that light caps would be a wonderful solution for matching
    hebrew/english.\r\n\r\nwhat do you people think about caps fonts? can it damage
    the dignity of a certificate?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: i really love geogrotesque minimalism, the feel of a clear and repetitive
    shape which suits really good to my designed letters.

    and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/breuer-text/\">Breuer Text</a>.\r\n\r\nAlso
    Din Display Pro might work for you.\r\n\r\nI would not use all caps.\r\nJeo."

  body: "I wouldn't use all caps for the whole document, it could become overwhelming
    to read. I also don't know how much type is on these certificates, if not so much,
    then you could use all caps, you just might need to have contrast in sizes.\r\n\r\nI
    like DIN a lot, its clean, precise, ledgible, not too mechanical, not too humanist,
    good for corporate identity or as a text font.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeo."
