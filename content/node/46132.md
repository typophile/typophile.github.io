body: "This work was a study based on a book I\u2019ve been reading (Designing Programmes
  ISBN: 978-3-03778-093-0) by Karl Gerstner. The two circles side by side represent
  the ancient MAPPA MUNDI as a answer to the question. I\u2019ve used a simple grid
  system by having every circle subdivided in for smaller ones \u2018inside of each
  other\u2019. The question big circle is also divided in 8 parts each of 45\xBA.
  The smaller circles are placed on the axis of the divisions. As for the \u2018effect\u2019
  on the smaller circles, the first part of the 4 divisions is rotated at 25\xBA,
  the second one at -25\xBA, to the third is added 10\xBA taking the first as a start
  and making it a 35\xBA rotation and then the forth (smaller one) is rotated -35\xBA.
  When we move to the second small circle (or 4 circles to be correct) I start the
  first with 45\xBA rotation (35\xBA + 10\xBA) and make the same routine as I\u2019ve
  done before. This allows that the inner circle of the last circle (which is near
  to the first one) has rotated -175\xBA (very near 180\xBA which is half of 360\xBA
  that all the circles did around the question). The left big circle is achieved by
  rotating each of it\u2019s four parts 0\xBA 16\xBA 32\xBA and 64\xBA.\r\n\r\nAny
  one knows and 'uses' this book? I'd like to exchange ideas about this book.\r\n\r\nPedro

  body: "I still think it is a valuable book even though it was born in Modernist
    tradition. It is more an Ulm system kind of design but the principles are still
    good. The thing is, it was written prior to computers so now so much of this kind
    of thing can be automated that it does not seem to have the intrigue it did back
    when it was written. The danger is that people might use it as a means without
    an end, making lovely progressions without meaning in communication of the message.
    There was \"form follows function\" but in this case it may be Form follows Process
    regardless of function. It is for the user to make it work well, not the technique
    to dominate.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
