  now and then I get a chance to work on my next* font which I think of it as a mesh
  font but I guess it's just another pixel font. It will come in both serif and sans
  serif and all will have the characteristic of ruff cut messiness :) \r\n\r\nShown
  is the stencil serif S with color fill. When all's done** it will have three weights
  and one weight in stencil ...maybe two if this thing keeps growing.\r\n\r\n*I have
  something like a half dozen fonts in 'progress'.\r\n**So far I have 5 letters in
  satisfactory state, and some punctuation marks.\r\n\r\nJust thought I'd share.\r\n\r\n\r\nn.\r\n "
