  body: "We have 6 instead of 3 winning entries. Amazing work... We are very happy
    with the results :)\r\n\r\nThe winners come from Yemen, Saudi, Morocco, Iraq,
    and Lebanon. We had submissions from Japan to the States and the areas in the
    middle. Most entries from Lebanon, second from Iran.\r\n\r\nWe are preparing a
    special section on our website for the winning works, the jury session, and the
    Award ceremony in Dubai. I'll post the link as soon as it goes online. \r\n\r\nThere
    are a few things that came out of the competition, some interesting observations,
    and we are currently thinking on how to show that. The dominant styles present,
    and the direction that the entries took, all fortell of new trends that are solid
    in base but very forward looking. A style that is considered archaic by many is
    going through a fully blown come back... Very interesting times..."
