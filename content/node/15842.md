body: "I came across a previous thread that mentioned the typeface Bell Gothic, and
  wanted to discuss a couple things with you fine and wonderful people.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nAs
  a young designer, Bell Gothic has intrigued me for its functionality and history,
  as it was designed primarily for small print and legibility. But I\u2019m starting
  to see this face more and more in corporate identity systems (the company I am employed
  at included). I\u2019ve seen it used on anything from the new FBI Anti-Piracy label
  on CDs, to American Express television advertising and collateral.\r\n\r\nI guess
  my question and invitation for discussion is, what do YOU as a designer think/feel
  when you see a typeface being used against its primary creation function? (IE: A
  face designed for small sizes being used for display type, etc).\r\n\r\nAnd on a
  side note, does anyone else think the uppercase \u201CI\u201D, when set in black,
  looks awkward? What was the motivation on keeping those serifs so thin???(See attached)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As a type designer, I may have a certain idea how a font might be or even
    should be used. I long ago learned that designers will do whatever they want anyway,
    often exceeding my expectations, doing things with my fonts that I would not.
    (I thought Felt Tip Roman should only be used about the size of actual handwriting,
    that it wouldn't look right at headline sizes. Silly me.)\r\n\r\nThe fact is,
    in graphic design there is a constant demand for novelty. Using typefaces in ways
    they were not intended is one way to achieve that. Once somebody does it, it gets
    noticed by other designers who copy the idea. Eventually, the idea becomes so
    widespread, that the novelty wears off and the cycle starts again with some other
    idea."

    body: "First off, thank you everyone for the responses\u2026but one in particular
      sparked an interest for further discussion\u2026\r\n<strong>\r\nRE: Mark Simonson\r\nThe
      fact is, in graphic design there is a constant demand for novelty. Using typefaces
      in ways they were not intended is one way to achieve that.</strong>\r\n\r\nIn
      response to this, where, as designers and critics, do we draw the line? I feel
      like from so many sources, whether it be former some of my art directors or
      the wonderful http://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/, I've been trained and told
      to respect and follow rules and guidelines.\r\n\r\nWill people use typefaces
      without regards to its \u201Crules?\u201D Perhaps. But is that wrong or right?
      Even if one does create novelty? Isn\u2019t disregarding its previous intention
      and function incorrect or \u201Cdisrespectful\u201D to a certain extent?\r\n\r\nJust
      giving food for thought and discussion\u2026\r\n"

    ink traps are mighty tasty -- to this non-designer's eyes, anyway. It's definitely
    something different to a lot of the other sans options they could have gone with.\r\n"
