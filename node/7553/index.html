		<div class="commentbody">Mark <BR> <BR>If you are planning to actually cut type fonts in wood (or do you mean digital renderings of wood type?) look up Hamilton Wood Type Museum on the web. They are a working museum in Two Rivers Wisonsin operating with all of the old Hamilton Wood Type Company's equipment and patterns. <BR> <BR>They make new wood type from the patterns and sell it to those who still want it. You might recall that a  couple of years ago Matthew Carter designed a new wood type face that they have produced in wood. <BR> <BR>If you could manage a trip there you would probably learn a lot if you get there at the time they are actually working on some wood fonts. <BR> <BR>If you are planning on simply cutting it out by hand, this will not apply a whole lot. If you plan to cut multiple letter fonts you will probably need a pantograph, like a Gorton or a Deckel or a number of other makes. <BR> <BR>The other day I made mention of Hatch Show Print in Nashville, Tennessee. Their site is certainly worth looking up. Additionally, they have recently publised a book showing their poster work from a hundred and some years ago till the present. Look em up for inspiration. <BR> <BR>I have cut a few wood letters here on the pantograph (Chinese characters)  as props for a photo shoot.  <BR> <BR>Best of luck in your quest. If I can help, let me know. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

I dearly hope it doesn't come to that, but my question is: the arborist will end up with big chunks of oak which he will take away. Should I keep any of it and try to make my own wood type?! Like an arboreal Neuland or something. Is oak the right kind of wood for this? How hard would it be to get the face level type-high?

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <BR> <BR>From what I have seen, woodtype is made from endgrain rounds of woods like maple, pear, cherry plum and apple in sizes up to about 20 line. This wood is finihsed off to near thickness and stored for many years before it is milled to type-height and hand rubbed to a mirror-like finish. There are some details about this in the Hamilton Woodtype Museum website.  In larger sizes it was cut in flat grain of the same woods. <BR> <BR>I am not an authority on the woods, so there are  no doubt others that were used. I know that in recent years woodcut illustrations and some wood type were cut on birch and poplar plywoods. Both are apparently almost grainless, and can be cut with knives and gouges to good effect for illustration. Chris Manson of Rockville MD uses these plywoods exclusively for his illsutration work.  <BR> <BR>I have cut a good many blocks for illustrations in medium density fibreboard and something sold here called Ranger Board. Both are nothing more than highly compressed paper fibre, but can be cut in very fine line and will stand up to heavy impression for long runs. The downside is that it can't be exposed to dampness, or it will double in thickess and will be useless for futher printings.  <BR> <BR>Oak as endgrain might be too pronouned in the winter/summer growth rings and as flat grain planks I am certain the pronounced grain would get in the way of making a clean, untextured image. On the other hand you might get a heap of money from a furniture maker or somebosy who has a lathe. <BR> <BR>After reading the Hatch Show Print book through time after time, I have become interested in pantographing some wood letters at my shop for poster printing. It's amazing how much inspiration one can pick up from reading and observing work like Hatch. <BR> <BR>I really urge everyone to pick up the book. <BR> <BR>Good luck with your tree. I hope you can save it. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jim, thanks. <BR> <BR>&gt; endgrain rounds <BR> <BR>What's that - the outside part? I guess that's the opposite of &quot;flat grain&quot;? <BR>A total lumber novice, am I. <BR> <BR>&gt; plum <BR> <BR><i>Now</i> you tell me. We had a plum tree that died*, but the only thing left now is some small chunks I use to smoke while BBQ-ing - the aroma is just great. <BR> <BR>* Of old age, as far as we could tell. Which means it was already nice and dry (see below). <BR> <BR>I went to a woodcutting fair a few months ago, and I remember they relied a lot on basswood, whatever that is. It's very light and white. Actually, I have some in the garage. Hmmm&hellip;. <BR> <BR>&gt; stored for many years <BR> <BR>I guess that's to dry it, to reduce volume change. Some searching I did on eBay seems to indicate that some people use kilns for that, bringing down moisture content to single-digit percentages. <BR> <BR>Interesting and highly useful insights about oak. Maybe the texture can become part of the character of what I do with it? It's going to be massively rough anyway. <BR> <BR>Oak is indeed supposed to be highly valued for furniture, so much so that it's a protected tree (over here in Glendale at least), so maybe like you say I can find a buyer. But I'd rather it stay right here, upright and in one piece&hellip; <BR> <BR>&gt; Hatch Show Print <BR> <BR>Will get it from UCLA on Thursday! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From the woodtype I've seen over the years, you need a really dense wood, which will dry and polish up to a really hard surface that will allow for a sharp edge to the letters and an easily cleanable surface. Basically, you want wood that emulates the printing hardness and durability of metal type, so you can get repeated clean impressions. Remember, wood type exists because casting metal type at that size is too expensive and weighs too much, but the goal in terms of printing quality is the same. <BR> <BR>The endgrain is the cross-section of the tree. This is the same surface used for making woodblock prints, and it is desirable because it can be easily worked but also polished to a completely smooth surface. If you cut across the grain, it is more difficult to work, and parts of the grain may appear as a pattern on the surface, no matter how finely you sand and polish. <BR> <BR>The wood is dried to harden it and also to ensure that any cracks form before the type is cut, rather than after it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry it has took me so long to respond, I became a little busy. In response to how I am doing it, I am planning to do it by hand mainly as I don't have money to do it any other way, and just build my own tools. Lately I have been doing many things by hand as a learning process, as an artistic process (I'm an Artist along with being a Designer), and just to get my hands dirty. I honestly find it great for learning, and its nice to get away from a digital setting off and on. Besides this I have also been doing calligraphy, and weekly book binding; along with setting up a screen printing area and dark room in my house. <BR> <BR>The way masters used to work just inspires me quite a bit. Not quite related, but still related, I rember going to this exhibition about two years ago where this lovely lady had created a book where she had made the paper, bound the book, and created all the type with in it (wood cut, 400 pages) it just greatly inspired me. <BR> <BR>Jim I would be very grateful if you sent that book to me, I will private message my address to you, thank you very much.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mark <BR>The best book on the subject of wood type is American Wood Type: 1828-1900 by Rob Roy Kelly, originally Van Nostrand, 1969. It is out of print but you can sometimes find it on eBay or in used book stores. There is a lot of digitized wood type out there, especially on my own site at <a href="http://www.woodentypefonts.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.woodentypefonts.com">http://www.woodentypefonts.com</a></a> <BR>Jordan</div>
