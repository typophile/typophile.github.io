body: "Fontlab is doing odd things when I compile my open type feature ( calt ).\r\n\r\n1.
  While in unicode mode ( Unicode on the left & Latin A on the right, I was adding
  Latin A characters ) it removed the outlines form hbar glyph when I re-compiled
  my now altered calt feature. The odd thing was that I had no reference to 'hbar'
  in the code!\r\n\r\nShould I start a new font & paste my content into it? I have
  heard some folks on Typophile talk about a source file going bad & needing to do
  this.\r\n\r\nNow that I am in Names & Mac Roman mode again compiling my calt feature
  didn't wipe out the hbar outlines. It did find a missing Quotesingle glyph. Could
  that have been wiped out when I went into Unicode mode to add the latin A?\r\n\r\nAre
  there safer & less safe modes to compile features in Fontlab?\r\n\r\nAnd actually,
  what is the recommended roundtrip process ( with emphasis on mode changes ) for
  adding unicode glyphs & then testing them?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Eben, it could be that there are some Unicode indices assigned to your alternates
    which actually map to real glyphs. You need for any alternate glyphs to be Unicode
    indexed to Private Use Area numbers, or to have no indexing at all. (If you only
    want the glyphs to switch out under calt conditions, you need no indices, but
    if you want to be able to select them from Glyph palettes, they need to have indices.)\r\n\r\nI
    have noticed that sometimes when I cut and paste glyphs, some of the cut information
    makes it into the new location. Look out for any glyphs whose Unicode is out of
    order, then check the name and index, and if need be, regenerate the name and/or
    Unicdoe using the Glyph Properties panel."

  body: Adam, I have had problems like what Eben notes, but have been able to fix
    them by manually changing the name, and making sure that "Replace exising" [sic]
    is selected.
