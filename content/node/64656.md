  body: "In typography, any typeface may be matched with any other.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if you must use Helvetica, it is usually best to use nothing but Helvetica, despite
    its shortcomings as a text face.\r\nThis is because such neo-grotesque types express
    the idea/myth that typefaces should be neutral, which adding a contrasting face
    undermines by introducing a typeface-centric dialogue.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, if
    one designs with an awareness of historical modernism, it is possible to reference
    other ideas, such as the origins of typeface modernism and the grotesque typestyle
    in the early 19th century, or Post-modernism.\r\n\r\nThen again, one may choose
    to ignore all cultural associations, and just consider pure form--in which case
    it may be best to just experiment in your layout, with an open-minded attitude,
    trying every serif face on your hard drive and seeing how you can optimize each
    combination. \r\n"

    by Adobe in 1992, was intended to solve a number of typographic problems related
    to office correspondence. This demanded versatility, so Slimbach created a font
    family with cuts for text, for titles, extra bold for headlines, small caps, all
    caps with numerals, old face numerals, fractions, ligatures and scientific markings.
    Not just its forms, but also its aesthetics make the balanced, elegant Utopia
    suitable for any use.\" (Linotype)"

    not only don't avoid Helvetica, I've even designed Helvetica (Greek, Cyrillic

    but after working on it pretty intimately, I came to the conclusion that it is
    rather more interesting and worthwhile than either its modernist fan club or its
    detractors suggest. Most versions suffer from very bad spacing, due to inheritence
    of unitised matrix widths, but the actual design rewards study."

    the actual design\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what that means. A font's spacing is integral
    to it. A font with bad spacing (or rather, spacing that doesn't match its vertical
    proportions) is a bad font. But Helvetica actually has <em>two</em> Achilles'
    heels: the other is its severe over-use, which no amount of good spacing will
    now cure.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    it the spacing that I would consider integral to the design, as opposed to integral
    to particular fonts. Helvetica was respaced for unitised widths, so can just as
    easily be respaced for better fit. I respaced Helvetica World (although I now
    think that spacing a bit too tight: more appropriate for subheads than text).\r\n\r\nOver
    use isn't a criteria for judging a design. It may be a reason to avoid using a
    type, but it isn't as if the character of the design changes over time due to
    over use. Look at the thing itself, not at your associations and perceptions of
    it."

    overuse. The perception of a typeface is created by its design, and if one perceives
    something to be ubiquitous then that will naturally become criteria when judging
    it. You cannot honestly say when you see and then consider Helvetica you don't
    remember where it has been used before?! \r\n\r\nYou can try to be objective but
    I would argue that ignoring your perception and association is impossible whether
    you think you're doing it or not.\r\n\r\n"

    and Times Roman go well together (unless they're very different in size, so the

    its very sharp serifs, which shouldn't really be on the same line as no serifs.

  body: "Hrant, whom do you imagine that I am 'appeasing'?\r\n\r\nI have spent time
    working with the Helvetica design, and I am making comments about the quality
    of that design based on intimate knowledge of it. And one of the points I have
    made about Helvetica a number of time, contra your 'homogenized Helveeta', is
    that this is actually a quite idiosyncratic design with many oddities of construction,
    ultimately only understandable as a reduced contrast romantic type, which makes
    its associations with modernism all the more ironic.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about
    the design, not about its use, over-use or appropriateness for any given purpose.
    Back before I worked on Helvetica Linotype (now Helvetica World), my opinion of
    Helvetica was largely the same as yours: a negative reaction to an overused, badly
    spaced font with, to me, unpleasant associations. Since working on it, I've been
    forced to acknowledge that the design itself is really quite brilliant, not least
    in its figure-ground relationships, i.e. its notan. It is still overused, and
    most versions are still badly spaced, and it still has unpleasant associations,
    but it is also a very clever bit of work that deserves to be acknowledged as such.\r\n\r\nHere's
    an idea for you: why not spend some time making an Armenian Helvetica? I wonder
    if your appreciation of the design might increase, as mine did when I worked on
    new Cyrillic and Greek versions."
