  body: Thank you, I appreciate that! Ken had also extended his invitation as well,
    and it would be good to meet you all. I rarely go outside of Edmonton and I dread
    driving (though I love traveling), but if the moment strikes, I'll be by!

  body: "(bump) Just a reminder -- this Wednesday.\r\n\r\nBecause the faculty is normally
    locked up, there will be one, and only one, door with a student waiting to let
    visitors in, and if you come after 6:30 p.m., you're out of luck."
