body: "Overton's is the world's largest water sports dealer and are re-branding. They
  want a logo that can be used for a water sports demographic (wake boarding, water
  skiing, tubing, etc.) as well as for a marine electronic demographic (higher end
  products). Logo choices have been narrowed down to these three. Please critique
  these logos as much as you possibly can. Criticism of any kind is greatly appreciated,
  however the constructive kind is always better. Because of placement on some products,
  the icon will have to be strong enough to stand alone as well as work with the logo
  as a whole of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Overtonslogo_4942.jpg]"

    logo at higher resolution before making any further suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n#2
    doesn't convey any energy or excitement.\r\n#3 is fine, but generic."

  body: "The O in #2 doesn't read like a letter - I see \"VERTON'S\" next to a swooshy
    logo.\r\nThe O in #3 looks somewhat like a Q. I also see the Barack Obama logo
    in its logo, but that may be less of a concern after the election passes.\r\nThe
    O logos in #1 and #3 may look too heavy to convey a sporty, skidding-across-the-water
    feeling. Almost donut-y.\r\nHeaviness aside, I like the type choice of #3 best."

  body: "#1 is really nice. It has connection to water sports. Maybe you will have
    to tweak a the O over the wave. It somehow reminds me of sun, which is great,
    but it could probably be done better.\r\n\r\n#2: no relation to water sports whatsoever.
    not memorable and O is not part of the word Overton's\r\n\r\n#3: Q? Noone seems
    the relation to QOMPAQ? Q? Very similar and also not enough relation to water
    sports.\r\n\r\nIf I were you, I'd only work on #1. Forget the other two. Really.\r\n\r\nPenn&ink
    suggested to remove the stroke. I think EXACTLY that particular stroke gives your
    logo some character. Without it will just be blunt and forgettable. And It will
    not go well with wave underneath that has stroke modulation. You'll maybe have
    to introduce stroke weight on teh O's stroke as well? Maybe... Try it.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

    don''t like the Borders around the O, I think it will work better without them.'

    about the stroke requiring some weight differentiation though ... perhaps it doesn't
    need to completely encircle the main O.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: "Thanks for all the comments so far everyone. The 'O' in the top icon is actually
    a throughput of the old Overton's logo. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OvertonsOLD_4686.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    agree the stroke around the top may be a bit too thick, Chose to go with that
    size to tie it in with the weight of the type underneath it. Without a stroke
    it does not stand up as well especially when the icon is by itself.\r\n\r\nAlso
    the top version was done in house here at Overton's and the bottom two came from
    some big agency in Texas. Thank you again for all your input so far."

  body: "#2's not bad per se .... it just... doesn't have much to do with water.  \r\n\r\nI
    definitely prefer #1 and agree that it's a bit heavy.  The other two just show
    why sometimes its best when possible to get someone within a culture to do design
    work.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta

  body: "The marks:\r\n\r\nThe Obama force is strong with 1 and 3, and 3 definitely
    reads as a Q at a quick glance. Perhaps what 2 is missing is a little of the dynamism
    that 1 and 3 have? Try skewing it to match the leaning type, maybe make it blacker
    to get the positives and negatives vibrating a bit more?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe type:\r\n\r\n1
    definitely has more of what it sounds like you're looking for: bold, in-your-face
    energy. I might rework some of the intersections between letters, but keep that
    RT, it's tasty.\r\n\r\n(edit) The N'S in 1 is pretty great too!"

  body: "I think #1 is the best by far, but agree with  few others that the line around
    the O should go. With regards to giving it weight without this, have you tried
    bulking up the waves so they are more in line with the O itself, and having the
    O a closer match to the name treatment below? You may find that helps.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I find the type for this one a little distracting. It's like you didn't quite
    know when to stop adding."

    the O (but can we see it without it, just to make sure). \r\n\r\nNot so hot about
    the logotype for #1 though. Seems incongruous with the icon. \r\n\r\n-I'd explore
    a logotype with the same O that you used with the icon. \r\n-What do you think
    about making the logotype more fluid? Right now it looks really angular to me."
