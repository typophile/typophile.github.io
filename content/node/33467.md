  will be black on a white wall.\r\n\r\nAre there any special tips/tricks to this?\r\n\r\nWhat
  would be the smallest point size?\r\n\r\nIs applying the Vinyl tricky?\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated"

    want to make sure your horizontal cuts are perfect, and if you get access to a
    laser level, it will be of great assistance.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't set anything smaller
    than 12/16 (unless it's some sort of reference number of a picture from an outside
    source) and the top of the label no higher than a meter/40\", otherwise you will
    alienate people with bifocals."

    weeding it can be a \u2019mare, also vinyl cutting machines are rarely 100% accurate
    (\xB115% in some cases).\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Hey! Here is something I actually know about.\r\nUnfortunately much of it
    has been said aready.\r\n\r\nlet's see... where to start...\r\n\r\nOK, I assume
    you'll be applying these to interior walls. Make sure the paint on the walls has
    dried thoroughly and that the surface is grease free.\r\n\r\nAs for text, anything
    smaller than 18pt I really wouldn't recommend, but consider the typical viewing
    distance and adjust accordingly. Sometimes you have to go smaller.\r\n\r\nWhen
    weeding text that is less than a half inch high:\r\nfirst only pull out the counters
    from the letters, \r\nthen make cuts through the vinyl, but not the release liner,
    between the lines of text. \r\nApply transfer tape over the text block, including
    the remaining waste vinyl (being careful to apply smoothly with no bubbles or
    wrinkles) and remove the release liner.\r\n\r\nLay the transfer tape with the
    vinyl letters on your table, adhesive side up.\r\nNow, carefully remove the waste
    vinyl line by line.\r\n\r\nReplace the release liner on the exposed adhesive until
    reeady to mount."

    You can do the layout in vector format and they will cut it exactly like you laid
    it out.\r\nThey can pretty well cut any size but what is more important what is
    a good readable size from a given distance.\r\nHave the sign shop \"weed out\"
    the background and apply a large sheet of premask.\r\nThis premask can hold all
    the lines or block of copy together so you can apply it all at once.\r\nAsk the
    sign shop for help and they will teach you the tricks on how to apply it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood
    luck\r\nGerry\r\n"
