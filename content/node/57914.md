  body: This could very well be hand calligraphy, given the varying 'e's and the lack
    of response from the crack team here. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/bickley_script_std_plain/">Bickley</a>
    might be a satisfactory alternative.

  body: docperchut, that's Arial, but next time you should really start your own thread.

  body: "It's definitely not calligraphy -- I'm guessing it's a free truetype font
    (judging by where I got this sample from). I may have to resort to searching on
    DaFont. Bickley is very close, though. That may work, and it's probably a better
    quality font.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "This is a mix of two of Rob Leuschke's fonts. The initial A is from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/qwigley-rob/|Qwigley]],
    and the rest of the lettering is from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/alex-brush/|Alex
    Brush]]. It's almost getting so I can spot Rob's stuff as soon as it shows up,
    because his personal style shows through in most of his work. He was a Hallmark
    lettering artist, and these days his scripts are getting more ID requests than
    any others, besides Ale Paul's. \r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
