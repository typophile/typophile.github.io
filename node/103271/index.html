<p>I&rsquo;m a publisher and designer and need to establish good type design parameters for Russian books. I don&rsquo;t speak Russian and therefore can&rsquo;t come up with settings that Russian readers would consider ideal for sustained reading. For English text and the usual text faces, the ideal number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) is about 67 per line. Has anyone heard of an ideal number for Russian? Grateful for any lead. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>Has anyone heard of an ideal number for Russian?</blockquote>In Russian a lot has been written on the allowable range of line lengths. Most recommendations or requirements express the line measure in ‘kvadrats’ and their fractions. One kvadrat equals 4 ciceros or 48 Didot points (in German those measurement units are known as <em>Konkordanzen</em>).
<p>National Industrial Standards (GoSTs) used to be strictly enforced in Soviet printing industry. After the fall of Communism they were replaced by the Sanitary Rules and Norms (SanPiNs), very similar to GoSTs.</p>
<p>Just one example. The <a href="http://verstka.otrok.ru/law/bv.html">SanPiN 1.2.1253-03, 06.15.2003</a> (<em>Hygienic requirements to the book editions for adult readers</em>) stipulates, among other things, that<blockquote>3.2.2. In the editions of the first category, with the font size of the main and the auxiliary texts larger than 10 point, the minimal line measure should be no shorter than 3 ¾ kvadrats (68 mm); the maximal line measure, the typeface, and the extent of the auxiliary text are not subject to regulation.’</blockquote></p>
<p>In his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Manual-Typography-Setting/dp/0321127307/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1369444386&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=The+Complete+Manual+of+Typography%3A+A+Guide+to+Setting+Perfect+Type">The Complete Manual of Typography: A Guide to Setting Perfect Type</a></em> (Berkley: Peachpit Press, 2002) James Felici suggests that <blockquote>the optimal line length is between one and a half and
two times the length of the lowercase alphabet.</blockquote> Mind you, the English alphabet has 26 letters, and the Russian 33… Is the Russian optimal line length between 50 and 66 characters?</p>
<p>One can come to the similar numbers (49–65 characters) by comparing the <a href="http://www.globallanguages.com/en/news/GlobalCommunicator/archives/GC_67_200805/fl_1.php">average word length</a>: 5.1 letters in English, and 6.36 in Russian.</p>

<p>I have looked a bit more into this notion and cannot confirm it. For the usual text faces it is more like 2.2 times the length of the lowercase English alphabet, not 1.5-2.0.</p>
<p>2.2 times gives you an average of 66-67 characters per line.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this formula is directly transposable to Russian, or any other language.</p>
<p>We need to find out what the ideal number of characters is per line of Russian text.

<p>Maxim, from what I can gather, Felici&rsquo;s measure is based on space (measurable in picas, or mm), not on the number of characters.</p>
<p>The 6.36 average length of Russian words is very interesting information. Taking that number into consideration, we ought to pack at least as many characters into each Russian line as we do in English, i.e. at least 66 characters (including spaces and punctuation). Fewer characters per line will inevitably result in undesired variation in word spacing and/or too much hyphenation.</p>
<p>Russian is generally an inflected language. Inflected languages are better set with smaller word spaces. This is one more reason to pack at least 66 characters into each line, for ideal sustainable reading.</p>
<p>Has anyone in Russia researched reading comprehension vis-à-vis typography?</p>
<p>Also, does anyone know of a style manual for Russian? I&rsquo;m looking for the Russian equivalent of the &ldquo;Chicago Manual of Style.&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>       http://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Manual-Style-16th-Edition/dp/0226104206/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369488480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=chicago+manual

I don’t know if the numbers I’ve referred to include word spaces. What I, like everyone else, do know from practical experience is that Russian copy is usually <em>longer</em> than English. Remember <em><a href="http://stbridelibrary.bigcartel.com/product/typographia-polyglotta">Typographia Polyglotta</a></em>?  There the Russian version of the same text is 15 per cent longer than the English (of course, that percentage varies with translation).

<p>This makes absolutely no sense.  As I already said, one should take into account two facts: the average length of words (in characters) is larger in Russian, and the average width of characters (in ems) is larger in Cyrillic.</p>
<p>And, given that, it is not surprising that the <em>expectations</em> of the readers are also very different.  For example, the Russian analogue of the Chicago manual of style (I have it scanned, but do not remember where it is now; it was published about ’64, and AFAIK, was not reprinted) says that “for the purpose of rapid-delivery typography” (newspapers etc.) more than 8 hyphenated lines in sequence should be avoided.  ;-)</p>
<p>I also have heard that for best results, one should compensate for larger average widths by making the spacing between words larger.  (Fortunately, PDFTeX now allows overriding the “width of space” provided in the font by the user-specified amount.  Unfortunately, hyphenation of TeX can’t be tuned from its English defaults — the style allows up to 3 hyphenated lines in sequence.)</p>

<p>To understand the rationale, imagine the average word length of some fictional language being 30 characters. How do you set this with an average character count of 70 per line? You&rsquo;d have huge word space and hyphenation problems. So what do you do? You put more characters into each line. Which comes at a price: your typesize goes down.

<p>The ideal parameters for setting English text don&rsquo;t seem to apply for at least three reasons: a) Russian has  a substantially different average word length, b) Cyrillic has different font metrics, and c) Russian is an inflected language.</p>

<p>I would not!  As I said, the character count is irrelevant.  I would just set line length in mm, and will let the typesetting program to find best line breaks.</p>

<p>You got it backwards.  First, you decide on type size.  Second, the line length.  And line breaks will be calculated basing on this.</p>

<p>Hard for who?  The typesetting program, or what?  Remember that the readers expectations in this language are very different from expectations of English readers!</p>

<p>Thanks for correcting my choice of the figure of speech.  Of course, these two steps are interchangeable.  AFAIU, there is very little interplay between them.  <strong>This</strong> independence is what makes the question of the “optimal number of characters in line” meaningless.</p>

<p>ilyaz, help me out. The book I need to design (in English and Russian) is 120 mm wide. My type area is 90 x 160 mm (excluding running heads and pagination). In other words the line length is 90 mm.</p>

<p>What is the reasoning behind this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frankly surprised that the average Russian word length is only 6.36 letters. My experience of typesetting Russian text is that it contains a <em>lot</em> of very long words, but perhaps that is in part due to the nature of the texts I have been working with (literary or scholarly, so not a day-to-day vocabulary). Even on a fairly generous measure, I find that the quantity of hyphenated line breaks in justified Russian text massively outnumbers that of English, and even with that amount of hyphenation  the count of over-wide word spaces and the risk of rivers remains higher than for English. Of the many scripts and languages with which I work, I think typesetting Russian text is one of the most difficult things to do well.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>Inflected languages are better set with smaller word spaces.</blockquote>
<p>What is the reasoning behind this?</blockquote></p>
<p>Reading comprehension.</p>
<p>I quote from Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s brillant book <em>The Elements of Typographic Style<em>:</p>
<blockquote>Language has some effect on the word space as well. In highly inflected languages, such as Latin, most word boundaries are marked by grammatical tags, and a smaller space is therefore sufficient. In English and other uninflected languages, good word spacing makes the difference between a line that has to be deciphered and a line that can be efficiently read.</blockquote>
<p>There must be Russian research into all this. We just have to find it.</p>
<blockquote>Even on a fairly generous measure, I find that the quantity of hyphenated line breaks in justified Russian text massively outnumbers that of English, and even with that amount of hyphenation the count of over-wide word spaces and the risk of rivers remains higher than for English. Of the many scripts and languages with which I work, I think typesetting Russian text is one of the most difficult things to do well.</blockquote>
<p>Same here. It&rsquo;s a challenge. But I&rsquo;m sure we can find a set of parameters that enable increase sustained reading.</p>

<p>If the normal word length in Russian is longer than in English, that means that shorter line lengths cause problems sooner; and yet, on the other hand, the nature of the lowercase alphabet means that longer line lengths probably also cause problems sooner - and so <em>any</em> line length likely means more compromises.</p>

<p>Thanks, quadibloc. Good resource.</p>
<p>I found there Eric Gill&rsquo;s statement: &ldquo;Practiced readers do not read letter by letter or even word by word, but phrase by phrase. It seems that consensus of opinion favors an average of 10-12 words per line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can we find the Russian readers' consensus of opinion? There must be data.</p>
<p>If the average Russian word length is 6.36, plus a space, and we put 11 words in each line, 7.37 x 11, the ideal number of characters per line would be about 81.</p>
<p>Maybe 10 words per line is acceptable (Russian readers are reportedly more comfortable with hyphenation than English readers). So 10 x 7.37, i.e. 74 characters per line, might be okay.</p>
<p>No matter how I look at it, the ideal number of characters in Russian text seems to be higher than in English.</p>

<p>Does not look reasonable. On the second glance, there is a fair proportion of 1-letter words.  So the averaging will <strong>strongly</strong> depend on how you average (it is natural to give every word the weight 1, or the weight equal to its length, or to its length plus 1 — this 1 to account for interword space).</p>

<p>Correct. I will include this allowance in our Russian type design.</p>

<p>For each language, typeface, and typesize, there&rsquo;s an optimum word space. We should try to set with spacing as close to that optimum as possible.</p>

<p>Hi John. Not sure which of the two he means. From my own experience I can say that subtle adjustments in text design can result in a noticeable increase in the speed at which I can read German or English text. I&rsquo;d be highly interested to understand how this works. It could be entirely individual, or there could be absolutes. Bringhurst tends towards the existence of absolutes. I tend to agree with him.</p>

<p>You are being ironic again?  I’m not very much interested in large-scale typesetting (page layout etc.), only in small-scale (words; at most, sentences).

<p>ilyaz, I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;m just trying to find out in which typesize you would set English text (and later Russian) in Times New Roman for a book that has a line length of 90 mm. 8pt? 10pt? 12pt?</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t you run tests, show typophiles the output, and ask what feels better; your question cannot be solved by equations and I doubt it can be answered from general principles. Here I ran tests comparing Brill (which I like) and Times New Roman (using XeLaTeX with an input file I put on my blog <a href="http://typophile.com/node/103349">http://typophile.com/node/103349</a>) and  which gave <a href="http://typophile.com/files/russian_90mm.pdf">this resulting pdf output</a>. 
Sizes were adjusted to get the same counts. That&rsquo;s the kind of thing I do to make choices (from my preference for TeX, you can guess that I am no editor, but an academic).</p>
<p>(The extract is from Chekhov&rsquo;s Дама с собачкой.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>Why don't you run tests, show typophiles the output, and ask what feels better;</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that is of course our last resort. We are, though, trying to avoid this empirical process. In the course of setting type in forty languages for several decades, we&rsquo;ve realized that following an authority is a time saver and will consistently yield good results, not always perfect, but certainly good, often very good. Perfection comes with individual fine-tuning, but to do that you need a panel of experienced readers for each language, ideally in close vicinity to control the environment.</p>
<p>So I was hoping, and am still hoping, to find the Russian Bringhurst.</p>
<blockquote>your question cannot be solved by equations and I doubt it can be answered from general principles.</blockquote>
<p>In English it definitely works. We start with the parameters for an average of 66/67 characters per line. It is quite ideal for most English texts, faces, and line lengths. From there we fine-tune.</p>
<blockquote>Here I ran tests comparing Brill (which I like)</blockquote>
<p>Do you prefer it over Times or Baskerville? In your sample, which I printed out, it looks very good, and very different from Times. Is Brill easier to read, comprehend?</p>
<p>Your 9.4/12 Times sample is set with larger word space, and therefore looks more like English text. Which I like. But how does it look to a Russian reader?</p>
<blockquote>which gave this resulting pdf output.</blockquote>
<p>Beautifully done. Thank you so much. Of your six samples, I am attracted to  10/12 Brill and 9.4/12 Times. Here we have an average of 61 characters per line. The color is fairly even. Would be interesting to hear from Russian readers.</p>
<p>My question remains: Hasn&rsquo;t anyone in Russia done all this already and published the results? As much fun it is to experiment, it does feel like reinventing the wheel.</p>
<blockquote>Sizes were adjusted to get the same counts.</blockquote>
<p>Excellent. You probably could push Times to 9.5 or 9.6.</p>
<blockquote>That's the kind of thing I do to make choices (from my preference for TeX, you can guess that I am no editor, but an academic).</blockquote>
<p>:)  Never worked with TeX. We sometimes use InDesign, but mostly our own software which was developed for us in the 80s.</p>

<cite>Obviously, you do not care about your reader’s experience. All you care about is your CPU temperature when you typeset your text…</cite></p>
<p>The conclusion is unwarranted. While additional CPU effort can improve the spacing of a paragraph, for example through the use of the justification algorithm devised by Donald Knuth for TeX, making the CPU work harder will not improve hyphenation.</p>
<p>Hyphenation is determined by the dictionary used by the program to show places where words can be broken. Since there will always be words that are absent even from a large dictionary, this means that if you don&rsquo;t want to burden the user of a word processing program with manually indicating possible points of hyphenation, the remaining alternative is to use a line length that will produce acceptable results even if words are never broken.</p>

The space in Brill is 198/1000.  The space in Times New Roman is 512/2048 which gives 250/1000; at 9.4 points, the Times New Roman space is (250*0.94-198)/198 = 18.7%  larger than that of Brill at 10 points.

<p>Twice in this thread he said, &ldquo;this question makes no sense.&rdquo; I think he meant, &ldquo;this question makes no sense to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ilyaz is full of emphatic certanties: &ldquo;I would not!&rdquo; &ldquo;I see no problems.&rdquo; &ldquo;Definitely not!&rdquo; &ldquo;readers expectations in this language are very different from expectations of English readers!&rdquo; If there were an absolute answer and a one-size-fits-all formula, this thread would have been over long ago. Discussion helps bring things into perspective; pontificating does not.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I have looked a bit more into this notion and cannot confirm it. For the usual text faces it is more like 2.2 times the length of the lowercase English alphabet, not 1.5-2.0.&quot;</em> Based on 67 characters per line (which I generally tend to agree with), including punctuation and spaces, you are correct.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;do those word-length numbers include wordspace?&quot;</em> I&rsquo;d say be definition, they do. Without wordspaces you do not have a word. You&rsquo;d have one word (6.36 characters times the number of words) in a line.</p>
<p>Getting away from formulas, don&rsquo;t we generally want to avoid as much hyphenation as we can? Don&rsquo;t we want to keep the line length no longer than just eye-movement will allow? (I.e., not require head movement, or as Nick Shinn called it, &ldquo;angle of vision.&quot;) Somewhere between the two probably lies the best answer.</p>
<p>As far as point size, set a few pages in different point sizes from 9 to 11 points and read (and have others read) them. You don&rsquo;t need as expert to tell you which is more comfortable. Since the line length is fixed at 90 mm, maybe another factor for point size should be the age of the reader. Are there going to be more people over 40 as the intended audience? Go with a larger point size. And vice-versa. Of course, we then get into the area of comprehension&hellip;.</p>

<p>One should handle definitions with care.  The next thing to say after what you did would be that “line length includes the LF and CR, since without them you do not have a line”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>don&rsquo;t we generally want to avoid as much hyphenation as we can?</em></p>

<p>No.¹⁾</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t we want to keep the line length no longer than just eye-movement will allow? (I.e., not require head movement, or as Nick Shinn called it, &ldquo;angle of vision.&quot;)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got this upside down.  “The general” eye-movement allows enormous angle of vision.  I think what is applicable here is the REM’s amplitude — do not know the proper term….  I do not even know whether saccades are powered by the same muscles as the larger scale movements….</p>
<p>¹⁾ Only when this does not contradict other goals.  Doing typesetting is making compromises.  And what one decides when compromising depends on the context.  In typesetting, it depends on the target audience.</p>
