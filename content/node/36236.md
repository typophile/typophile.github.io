  was looking for any information when I found this site, which helped me put a name
  to the design.\r\n\r\nI am hoping there is someone in this design forum who may
  have seen this and can help me find it as a gift.  I've seen the shape used in books
  and such and it's lovely.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help,\r\nL"
