body: "Hi guys (and Tiffany), I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to solve a problem
  I've been stuck on for months now. I may have posted about it before but can't seem
  to find it now, so am asking again.\r\n\r\nI am converting some GPL'd Dravidian
  fonts to AAT so that the scripts work correctly on my computer, and have been unable
  to replicate the GPOS mark\u2010to\u2010mark and mark\u2010to\u2010base positioning
  features.<!--break--> I would really prefer to avoid creating a huge kern table
  as there are no tools to help edit those. I basically want to move swaras and vattus
  around in a context dependant way.\r\n\r\nSince I didn't design the fonts and the
  originators will update them from time to time I'd prefer not to modify/create glyphs
  of my own.\r\n\r\nA sample of the incorrect rendering:\r\nhttp://web.nickshanks.com/typography/Kedage_errors.png"
