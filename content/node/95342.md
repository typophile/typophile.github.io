body: "Hello all.\r\n\r\nWith each new book I compose, the last 10 years or so, I
  steadily improve the kerning of my stable of text typefaces (by adding to/adjusting
  kerning tables in Quark).\r\n\r\nBodoni Book roman and italic, for instance.\r\n\r\nI've
  just purchased the OpenType Bodoni Book, because it's got full f ligs, among other
  things.\r\n\r\nIf I disable \"Use OpenType Kerning\" in Quark, and then look at
  the OT Bodoni Book in the Kerning Table Edit window, the font's got no kerning table.
  I assume, then, that the kerning pairs that used to display there, for the postscript
  Bodoni Book, are now incorporated into the OT face itself.\r\n\r\nMy question is,
  then: into this blank kerning table for the OT Bodoni Book, do I import my years-old
  set of kerning pairs? I'm guessing the answer is no, and I merely start all over
  with my manual kerning?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
