  this is the \"release\" forum, please list some of your portfolios, or fonts you've
  made. I only ask this because I'm launching a new site called Fawnt.com and I want
  to find the BEST fonts. I've been searching the web for days looking for the best
  fonts for designers, developers, and people that like pretty fonts. The site doesn't
  have a ton of fonts right now because I only added a few dozen. I've collected a
  lot of fonts, but I'm looking for more!\r\n\r\nI'm only looking for free fonts really,
  and if yours gets on the site, it will be nothing but a ton of exposure!\r\n\r\nFeel
  free to post fonts you've made, and any thoughts!\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. The site hasn't
  officially launched yet :P\r\n"

    you exploit get 'exposure' and you get <strong>cash</strong> in the form of ad
    revenue. Have you considered paying the designers that money? Think of the great
    PR such a move would create?"

    design resources. That being said, the chances of a designer with a nifty portfolio
    showcasing pirated fonts is very slim. The possibility of it on deviantart and
    other resources is greater, but by reading the comments and other notes it gives
    you reassurance that the original poster is the creator. (people will call you

    the appeal of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn finding \"appealing\" fonts, I tend to look
    for clean fonts with an easy to read typeface that would be good to use for design,

  body: "When many free fonts are released, the license agreement allows for distribution
    on free font web sites. So you're not doing anything wrong if you abide by the
    rules. When I made my freeware fonts, I did so with full knowledge that they would
    be used for commercial purposes and would be distributed on free font websites.
    I don't know why anyone would have a problem with that. Free fonts are released.
    Free font sites are a legitimate method of distribution. It's nice when font site
    owners give back to the designers. In over a decade at this, Jason Nolan at 1001freefonts.com
    is the only free font website owner who actually gives something back. Payment
    for distribution on a free font site is not required for any free fonts as far
    as I know.\r\n\r\nHere's a freeware site with a similar aim which I made a couple
    of months ago.\r\nhttp://www.fontsugar.com/\r\n\r\nResearching the origins of
    free fonts and sending a few hundred email for fonts which require permission
    is the hardest part. I had some help and it took a solid month to put together.
    Most freeware font designers are hard/impossible to track down. There are very
    few actual free fonts, most are shareware or have complex licensing restrictions.\r\n\r\nFeel
    free to use any freeware fonts from Larabie Fonts. If you get rich, send me a
    free t-shirt. If you download them using the shopping cart feature on MyFonts,
    you'll be informed of updates . . . so you can keep the versions on your site
    fresh. I hate getting tech support email about buggy versions of fonts I made
    in 1996.\r\n\r\nThere are a few free fonts on Typodermic.com - you can use those

    about directing people to Typodermic and introducing people to MyFonts. Even though
    they''re free fonts, it''s all about gettign people to use the MyFonts shopping

    for some freebies for a project. If they end up at Larabie fonts, tossing freebies
    in the shopping cart, they may end up getting hooked on a pay font that''s too
    good to pass up. The perfect font for their project. So, the freebie customer
    is now a first time font buyer. Perhaps they''ll discover the advantages of pay
    fonts (no weird license restrictions, better quality and support). A lot of freeware
    sites I''ve seen attempt to trick people into visiting pay sites. I didn''t want
