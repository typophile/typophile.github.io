body: "I'm currently working on a website for a new industrially designed product
  and have an oddly specific client font request. \r\n\r\nIn the client's words:\r\n\"The
  capital M must have straight sides and the bottom of the point must be in line with
  the two arms. \r\nThe capital A's uppermost point must be slightly flattened rather
  than ending in a sharp point. \r\nThe lowercase a should be of the kind that does
  not have an arm over the top of it but rather looks more like an o with a line in
  the back.\"\r\n\r\nSome background on the job:\r\nThis is for use throughout the
  site in both headings and body copy. \r\nFonts I had in mind for use were (one of
  the following) Formata, Myriad Pro or Open Sans\r\n\r\nThe only font I can find
  that meets this criteria is [[http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Muli|Muli]]
  but with no bold weight it's rather limited for comprehensive use.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  think of any alternatives? "

  body: "Those specs -especially for the \"a\"- do point to a sans, but you might
    want a serif font anyway. FYI serif fonts that have an \"a\" like that are often
    termed \"Primary\" since they're supposed to be reading-learner\u2013friendly.\r\n\r\nBTW
    for clients that are this picky it's worth a shot pitching a custom -or at least
    customized- font, since they typically always find <em>something</em> they don't
    like in an existing font no matter how many you show them!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Cheers Si_Daniels and hrant. Both \"primary\" and \"schoolbook sans\" are
    useful classifications in my search. Golden Days is a great place to start as
    well, will test it out for body copy and see how it feels.\r\n\r\nNot so sure
    about Avante Garde Gothic as a body copy font, might start to get a bit busy to
    read large chucks.\r\n\r\nBTW. My wife is a new entrants teacher and she professes
    a love for comic sans for beginner readers."
