  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey, i am brand new to this website and this forum. So please be nice! 
I started a clothing company around 18 months ago. But i have had many comments saying its not clear to read the typeface and that the 'r' looks like 2 letters instead of one. So i have decided to totally re-design it.

The thing is i forked out for photoshop cs3 extended about 8 weeks but to be honest don't have a clue where to start really.

i know that my old logo looked a bit childish i want the new one to look more professional.

i really like the font gill sans mt condensed and was wondering if you bright sparks could give me some good alternatives.

also if you good give me some ideas on layout and things like that, it would be very much appreciated.

below i have put and example of the past logo.

please ANY help is very much appreciated!

the color scheme i want to be very neutral

thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For starters, I'd suggest using vector-based software (ie Illustrator) to design your logo—or at least to produce it. If you're logo is vector you'll have no issues separating it for film (for silkscreening) or blowing it up to go on a billboard.

As for your old logo, I think the childish look has a lot to do with the bubbly letters, and the primary colours. Go ahead and use Gill Condensed and some neutral colours and you're already miles ahead of your old logo. 

Of course these are very basic suggestions... you should really consider who you're trying to appeal to and go from there.

Best of luck!

		<div class="commentbody">It feels like these are lacking an idea behind them. Why is the I all contorted? It seems like you've done it just because you can.

Why don't you forget about the computer for a bit and try drawing some ideas? The computer can too easily dictate what you make. And like Eric said, the primary colours don't look good.

Keep on it, you'll come up with something!

It might be easier for you to get your ideas out and let someone else who has technical training do the art.

		<div class="commentbody">You should see more and more logos and don't forget a thing, if you think the font is beautiful, don't change it much!
i think that that I would be better to be less distorted.

Something i try to do when i do a logo is to write on a paper everything remember about the brand so i can get its "personality" its "style". Then it's drawing around that.

		<div class="commentbody">What type of clothing company do you have? Maybe do a tattoo inspired "in my" in a banner over a heart, Ed Hardy like. If it's more of a "cute" or "stylish" type clothing company, look to a more feminine look than you have designed. Check Veer for fonts like Affair or Loving Acts.</div>
