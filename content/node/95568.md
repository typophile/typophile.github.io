body: "I'd like to know the name of the typeface used to spell out the face values
  (e.g. [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Zimbabwe_%24100_trillion_2009_Obverse.jpg|ONE
  HUNDRED TRILLION DOLLARS]]) on the 2007 and 2008 Zimbabwean banknote series. According
  to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_Zimbabwe#Paper_money_of_the_third_dollar_.28ZWR.29|Wikipedia]],
  the earliest of these notes were printed in October 2006.\r\n\r\nIt's a sans-serif
  outline typeface, and the most distinctive thing about it is that some of the letters
  (A, [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Zimbabwe_%241000000_2008_Obverse.jpg|M]],
  N and [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Zimbabwe_%2420_2007_Obverse.jpg|W]])
  have exaggerated overshoots (with the last three also extending below the baseline).
  I haven't had any luck with WhatTheFont or Identifont.\r\n\r\nSome other examples
  for the different letterforms:\r\n[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/1_Zimbabwe_Dollar_2008.jpg|ONE
  DOLLAR]]\r\n[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Zimbabwe_%2410_2007_Obverse.jpg|TEN
  DOLLARS]]\r\n[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Zimbabwe_%24500_2007_Obverse.jpg|FIVE
  HUNDRED DOLLARS]]\r\n[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Zimbabwe_%2450_billion_2008_Obverse.jpg|FIFTY

  body: Thanks very much for both of your replies. It looks to me like it's just Futura
    with a custom border applied - I suppose preventing forgeries isn't a priority
    during hyperinflation.
