  make some sort of  planning for what I'm gonna do. I've never been to TypeCon or
  one of the alikes, and I don't know if I should. I'm probably the only teenager
  there and (Typecon, at least) it's quite expensive. I'm willing to pay more than
  I should though ;-P If you got any advise about type activities from July 4 to August
  19 that would be great. If possible close to the Netherlands and not too expensive.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nJasper

    up all night drinking. Especially when it's happening in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIf
    I were in your position I would probably just spend half the summer days tracing
    classic typefaces and the other half designing new ones. "

    is not terribly expensive as conferences in general go. New Orleans is not the
    closest possible US destination, but not the worst, either.\r\nhttp://www.typecon.com/\r\n\r\nATypI
    is more expensive, but its prices include lunches. However, we have substantial
    discounts for students, and I would expect airfare to Reykjavik would be reasonable
    (compared to New Orleans, anyway).\r\nhttp://www.atypi.org/2011-reykjavik\r\n\r\nATypI
    has not yet announced prices for this year's conference (Real Soon Now), but they
    will be similar to last year's:\r\nhttp://old.atypi.org/30_past_conferences/03_Dublin/70_register\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Wells College summer program has a variety of classes related to typography, type
    design, typefounding, and book arts. I've signed up for a Monotype casting class
    at the Bixler type foundry, but I'm only the second person and they need at least
    four to run the class. If you sign up, more chance it'll happen! I went to Wells
    a few years ago and had a great experience. Some big names teach and attend the
    workshops; Julian Waters, for instance, is teaching this year. \r\n\r\nI'm a teenager
    too, by the way. I've found that if you're knowledgeable, respectful, and enthusiastic,
    you're usually welcomed at any event."

    wells thing is pretty cool, but I' like something with a closer focus on typedesign
    and it's still quite expensive. I'm too late for the legacy of letters thing,
    I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nI've found this on the ATypI website and it's rediculously
    cheap, \u20AC60,- ! http://typetalks.org/Symposium2011/Registration.html\r\n\r\nHas
    any one of you been there?"
