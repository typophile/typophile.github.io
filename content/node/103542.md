body: "Hello there guys, i'm really wanting to purchase Doyald Young's books, but
  they aren't the easiest to find, especially in Europe. I found this website, and
  they have the boxed set for sale: http://www.doyaldyoung.com/DYC01.html\r\n\r\nHowever,
  there is zero contact information on the site, and i'm a little wary spending $300
  when I don't even know if i'll get the item, I don't see the boxed set for sale
  anywhere else like Amazon. For this type of purchase I would want to track it and
  insure it, but there are no options for that. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if the site
  is legit? Or if there is anywhere else I can buy the boxed set?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Josh"

  body: "I found two of the books on ebay. All three of the books (not as a set) can
    be found at various booksellers on abe.com (owned by Amazon). You could save a
    few dollars, especially on shipping, by buying the individual books on abe.com.\r\n\r\nAlso
    on abe.com is one listing for the boxed set, but it is $350.00. If you contact
    the bookseller and point out that the retail price is only $300.00 new they might
    match it, and you might save on shipping.\r\n\r\nOn both sites I used the keyword
    search term \"Doyald Young\". FWIW, I think the site you mentioned is legitimate.\r\n\r\nHTH"

    away.\r\n\r\nNot sure how it works now, but it is a legitimate site."

    all miss him.
