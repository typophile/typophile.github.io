body: "Hey Everyone,\r\nI'm starting a CD packaging project and came up with this
  lettering style. It's still somewhat rough, and I still have issues with it, especially:\r\n\r\nThe
  difference in style between the Swash R and G\r\nLowercase \"s\" looks rather weird\r\nUppercase
  E\r\n\r\nAny comments and suggestions on this would be awesome!\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRodrigo"

  body: "Looks very good!\r\nThe style difference between the R & G doesn't really
    bother me, but the uppercase E does need a little work (it reads like a C now)...\r\nMaybe
    you could smoothen the style difference between the R & G by blending with the
    E, making the top part angular & the bottom part curved (as in some ampersands)?\r\nAs
    for the lowercase s, maybe making a small straight vertical line at the top &
    the bottom before curving could help..."

  body: "Thanks for your observations.\r\nHere goes a revised version of the logo
    with different styles for uppercase E, S. Revised S taking the observations into
    account (they look much better!). I also designed the uppercase swash E that goes
    between the name (I was using Bauer Bodoni for the & sign before). Also the dots
    of the lowercase i were somewhat bothering me so I removed them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Revised-Lettering_3653.gif]"

  body: "I read the 'E' as an 'F' now. However the dotless 'i's definitely work better,
    as do the hanging caps and the new ampersand.\r\n\r\nPerhaps take out the loop
    from the 'E'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "The uppercase S looks great now & nice going with the i's!\r\nThe uppercase
    E however does read like an F now, but as Lex suggested, taking the loop out might
    do the trick."
