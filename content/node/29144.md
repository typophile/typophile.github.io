body: "Is there a way to denote a paragraph break in the OpenType Feature Definition
  Language?\r\n\r\nThe paragraph break as such (not the pilcrow _glyph_, that is,
  but the _character_, so to speak), has no code point in the font, but is implemented
  through and handled by the text processor or text setting engine. So, unfortunately,
  I don't see a way to incorporate it in an OpenType feature.\r\n\r\nIt might be very
  useful to have this, though; one may want to have for example end swashes only at
  the end of a paragraph."

  body: You're correct that there's no way to do this in OpenType today. line and
    paragraph beginnings/endings are not really handled in OpenType.

    body: That's quite unfortunate. Could it be done by the text setting engine? I
      mean, at every instance where a line or paragraph breaks, the text engine could
      call the font and insert the appropriate glyph. One could go even so far as
      to implement this into the line breaking algorithm, so that the advance width
      of the alternate glyph could be reckoned with, while calculating the optimal
      spacing. I guess this is similar to how 'jalt' (Justifcation Alternates) works?
