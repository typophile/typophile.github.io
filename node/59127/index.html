  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My passion and respect for typography has thrown me into a big search for the &ldquo;right type&rdquo; since I am going to redesign a street-mag. Today they are using Blur as an &ldquo;identity-font&rdquo; and Warnock in the main text and headers. In my opinion warnock lacks a bit personality, and allthough it might be an easy-to-read font the fact that it requires 9 pt. to be acceptable in large portion of text makes it a non-ideal choice. For the Blur, I love alot of Nevilles Brody´s work and can understand the intention for this choice (typish street-mag), i find it a bit cliché. My aim is to make a cleaner look that appeals to the reader, and typefaces that are both a bit bold aswell as classical (no glossy magazine type or fancy/ultramodern stuff). Since the readers age streches from 15-80 years old the main type has to be an font that is easy to read. I could throw in some of my suggestion but am really eager to hear what other people might think based on personal taste and experience. In addition I would also love some examples of magazine etc. that you find works for you in style and type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Juuni,</p>
<p>I happen to design a skateboard magazine in Brasil, so I think it is almost the same clientele.</p>
<p>For me, this is a field where you should have as much fun as the the guys riding in the pictures your about to layout. Ok, maybe a little less&hellip;But if there&rsquo;s an audience that is willing and opened for novelty, this is it. Whatever new ideas I have, this is where I put them in practice. Where I can implement new paths without worrying so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d totally forget about prior typefaces and aim a lot higher and crazier.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that you are on right track on wanting to do something cleaner and avoid the cliches of Blur-like low-fi fonts and handdrawn stuff. Actually I seem to have the impression that most skate and graffiti people I know prefer very well drawn, usually geometrical fonts to lowfi stuff.</p>
<p>To get a street feel I think it´s the combination of things, you can get the rough edge through variety of means, not only typographical, so the type can have a lot of character – or not. I´d say that in magazines the papers and format are extremely important.</p>
<p>If you take Pin-Up (<a href="http://www.pinupmagazine.org">http://www.pinupmagazine.org</a>), a magazine for architectural enterntainment, the layout is super clean in helvetica only but when you see the object, printed on very rough recycled paper, it has a great trash look. Also the use of color is great.</p>
<p>The Finnish Kasino A4 is on the same lines, a street credible look achieved by trash fotography and good choise of papers. The layout here also in Helvetica+Times. You can´t really see the interiores here, though&hellip;
<a href="http://www.wearekasino.com">http://www.wearekasino.com</a></p>
<p>The legendary BUTT, gay porn mag, also has some of the trash look even though it´s typographically very controlled.
<a href="http://www.buttmagazine.com/">http://www.buttmagazine.com/</a></p>
<p>Or done well, using ugly type can avoid overdesign, like in the really interesting redesign of the 032c:
<a href="http://www.032c.com/">http://www.032c.com/</a></p>
<p>These are really architectural &amp; fashion references, but hey, what the hell, maybe it´s good to mix the genres ;)</p>

<p>I can mention that the magazine is sold on the streets by people who experience hard times in their life, mainly drug addiction (and is also a source of income). The content revolve around society mainly reflects on the &ldquo;strugglers&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Juuni,</p>
<p>I signed up just to respond to this.</p>
<p>Did you attend the recent INSP event in Bergen? I work (volunteer) on a street paper here in Vancouver; our editor went to the event and it sounded great. I assume you are redesigning Megaphon as your profile says you are in Bergen.</p>
<p>We have a collection of street magazines from around the world. I don&rsquo;t have them all here, but it is quite a spread from very good to very poor typography and design.</p>
<p>The two I have in front of me now (that I think are good) are: =oslo, and sorgenfri. I have a couple other favorites, but don&rsquo;t have them on hand.</p>
<p>You should contact the INSP (International Network of Street Papers) and start your own collection of street papers, just to see what everybody is doing. I think it&rsquo;s important that we all leverage the international aspect of street papers, as it helps with design, strategy and even with establishing credibility with public (a surprising number of Vancouverites have poor opinions of street papers).</p>
<p>Send me a personal email with your address and I can send you some issues of our magazine. It is also called Megaphone (megaphonemagazine.com).</p>
<p>It seems to me the european magazines have vastly better support and print budgets. We put ours out on newsprint and everyone is a volunteer. The volunteer part does make dedicating too much design time a problem, as we also have to pay our studio rent and scratch out a living. I would like to make every issue better than it is, but there simply isn&rsquo;t enough time. But I would love to be working with the quality of paper and sheet size used in the Bergen Megaphon (I have one right here).</p>
<p>A street paper does not have to look grungy. It is an important vessel to carry news and stories that the mainstream media ignores or rarely focuses on. Many people, in the backwater that Vancouver can be, believe a street paper should be dirty and grungy and have spelling errors and so on. That&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>Hmm. I could go on.</p>
<p>But email and let me know about your work as I&rsquo;m quite interested, and &ndash; I repeat &ndash; these publications can benefit hugely from international support, communication and collaboration.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Todd</p>
