  body: Cooper Black = 80s? you&#39;re talking about the 1980s right? Hmmm. <BR> <BR>When
    I remember the 80s I remember Memphis style with lots of wavy lines and Univers
    Condensed Oblique set on an angle to match the slant. Remember that? <BR> <BR>And
    Charles S. Anderson and the retro, rubber stamp feeling. Maybe some Torino or
    Corvinus Skyline or Fenice. Or maybe even just some Cheltenham Condensed. <BR>
    <BR>I also think of early Neville Brody stuff -- Industria, Arcadia. Or maybe
    early Emigre -- Modula, Senator, Base 9. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s some of what says
    the 80s to me. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: '&#62;Cooper black How does a 20s typeface have an 80s flair? :-&#41; Still
    used as VIVA TVs principal font, though... Eerie, to see that font on young music
    television... Fonts with massive 80s flair, imo are the various works of Neville
    Brody, mostly available through Fontshop and Linotype. The standard, non Fontshop-modded
    DIN-Schrift also was very big, at least in Germany, in the 80s, used in a mag
    named TEMPO. Not a font from the 80s, but it fit the cold and sterile tone of
    the times. Many Emigre Fonts stem from the 80s, especially their bitmap work like
    Oakland. Also, Modular and Triplex suggest themselves, but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re
    from the 80s originally. Also, if we go late-80s, there were already some Instant
    Fonts in Use. VERY late 80s, we got the Beowolf by Letteror. Despite being called
    the Helvetica of the 90s, Erik Spiekermanns Meta was originally created in the
    mid-80s and somehow has an 80s Flair, imo, till today. Also, if you look at Vaughan
    Olivers stellar work, a nice step back in history is okay, so even Garamond and
    Sabon or specimen from old books can be used. '

    Tiffany &#40;ITC&#41; <BR> <BR>For a display type crying &#34;1908s&#34; and stuck
    in them &#40;for now&#41; Enviro, Santa Fe and Harlow are the best for me. &#40;I
    hate Enviro but I&#39;m following the brief&#41;. <BR>Serif Gothic and Eras are
    also very OK for a more formal look. <BR>If you want to look a bit &#34;too fancy
    for my cat&#34;, Tiffany is fine, instead. <BR>Steve &#40;ITC/Letraset&#41; it&#39;s
    from 1973 but it recalls a lot the &#34;future past&#34; attitude of the 1980s
    first videogames generation. A lot more than Data70 or Countdown and Amelia, more
    connected to their own 1970s. <BR> <BR>I hope I have spotted something suitable
    for your poster. <BR>'

  body: ITC Garamond was very big in the &#39;80s. Goudy Oldstyle and Les Usherwood&#39;s
    stuff was pretty popular in the early &#39;80s. Later on with the desktop publishing
    boom, probably because of the limited quality type choices at the time, you saw
    a lot of the &#34;LaserWriter 35&#34;, especially Palatino. The first few batches
    released by Adobe skewed things a bit, causing a revival of sorts of Century Oldstyle,
    Trump Medaeival, Optima, Bodoni and some others. Used to see Futura used with
    ITC Baskerville a lot. Bernhard Modern and Onyx were both pretty big. None of
    these really says EIGHTIES the way some of the others that have been suggested
    do, but these are ones I recall seeing a lot.
