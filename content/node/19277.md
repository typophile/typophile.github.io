  body: Some similar faces are [[Eric Olson]]'s <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/charregular.html">Bryant</a>,
    [[Jonathan Hoefler]] and [[Tobias Frere-Jones]]' <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/more07.html">Gotham</a>,
    [[Mark Simonson]]'s <a href="http://ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html">Proxima
    Nova</a>, but none have the seriffed capital "I".
