Miguel a while back posted some previews of the new icon system and I am pleased to say I LOVE the new system! With a very quick peek at the dock, I can instantly launch the Adobe app I want without having to figure what the butterfly/flower/whatever business is all about. It is now just, BaDaBing, right there! WHAT A PLEASURE! 

So Miguel, I don't know who was smart enough to make the decision to go that way, but buy them a beer for me! BRAVO!!!

But to change the subject a bit: If anyone's using the new CS 3 programs on a G5 (or other PPC-based) Mac, how does the speed compare to the CS 2 versions? I'd be anxious to know especially if they're really slow (edit: though that's not what I've read so far regarding PS).

		<div class="commentbody">I’ve been using CS3 exclusively for a couple of weeks now, it really is a killer update. The new icon system is killer; I have yet to launch the wrong app. And talk about performance, it’s a pretty impressive performance tweak, at least by Adobe standards. All the DP apps are rock solid stable too.

Of course, I’m still pretty ticked that getting this requires an expensive update with few new features that can justify the price. If Creative Suite had been published by a video game company, as opposed to Adobe, the performance overhaul and stability fixes from CS2 and CS3 would have been a free patch. If I actually had any money I would establish a fund to try and bring Inkscape, Scribus, and the GIMP up to par with Adobe’s apps so that we could stop having to buy upgrades just to get bugfixes.</div>

Sorry to bring back this old debate. 
I'm one of those who customize everything since MacOsX's first appearance. I don't want it to look old, or as it was before, but design choices should make sense.

And I agree that this icons are a big improvement, mainly because the colors haven't changed again (which was the reason why I always clicked on the wrong icon)

Much more than any user should be required to and MUCH more than with any application I have ever used since 1986. I have used the Adobe apps since they hit the streets on day one. I was quite able to figure out which was which untill they started the CS naming series. I use these applications every day--practically all day. When I am working in a fury trying to meet a deadline or keep a train of thought, I should not be impeded by a cryptic icon system. If I wanted pretty pictures, I can load my desktop with them. To me, the previous picture icons were like trying to read my tax forms in Bickham Script with swash and all the frillies turned on. It might look pretty but is a pain in the aß to read. Thank heavens Adobe saw the light and made their icons readable.

There is no import tax most US companies have Irish or Euro Sales/shipper places. Compugraphic had a place in Shannon and Microsoft has one in Dublin and Reading and London, so most set up a company to localize and ship around the world. 

If they don't keep the prices the same in the European Union they will get in big trouble with Brussels.

That sounds like a mistake. Surely, Adobe knows pounds, euros, and dollars are not valued the same. Has anyone questioned Adobe about this disparity in pricing? It may just be a typo or some other screwup. The software they send to the UK is exactly the same as the U.S. version, I assume.

Dan, I said the design has a lot of virtues, and these are included. But 'totally awesome'? No doubt there is a lot of subjectivity in this, but it seems a lot of us don't feel it gets to the 'awesome' level. 

And among those, some are already supplying new 3rd party icons. Did this happen before with the earlier icons?  </div>

Icons, above all, need to function. It is not unlike glyph readability. There is a place for decorative display faces, even grunge or graffiti faces, but in a situation where being able to read is key, a plain text font fits the Bill better.

hahahahahahahahaha LOL

The point I'm trying to make in a roundabout way is that I agree that Adobe's icon project feels unfinished and could have been better though out. I like Adobe very much, have used their products for about a billion years, and don't mean to disparage them. But they recognized an opportunity for consistency and made only a half-hearted stab at it, IMHO. Though I agree with everything in Chris' original post, and I applaud this new approach, I feel it could have been taken further.

The "extensions" argument doesn't work with me. My Illustrator files (and I don't call them Ai files) are usually .eps extensions, and my Photoshop files are usually .tif extensions. My .ind extensions are lowercase, not small caps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">MetaDesign's strategy for the system was born of the idea of mnemonics. Due to the acquisition of Macromedia by Adobe their product portfolio went from roughly seven products to around sixteen. A system similar to the periodic table was proposed. The characters chosen to represent the product are for memorability purposes; sometimes this leverages the already familiar.

I should note, Meta proposed this strategy along with  an entire brand evolution (having been the agency responsible for the design of CS1 and CS2 packaging and icons), they were not responsible for the execution of anything CS3.</div>

The periodic table, which this icon system uses for inspiration, doesn't use Small Caps. I don't know how many camelbacked words Adobe uses for its sixteen products, or why they felt a need to use Small Caps to indicate camelback words. I'm only saying that in a row of three icons (Ai, IN, Ps) the Small Cap N looks out of place.

Maybe Miquel can offer some insight.??

I like the Adam Betts redesigned icon set (shown here in my dock). It keeps the the periodic theme and colors but adds a little more excitement to what is IMHO too plain an icon set. Also, the original icons add too much weight to the dock especially with the square edges. They were way too conspicuous and out of place in my dock. I think Adobe should have at least rounded the edges of the icons with a small radius.

		<div class="commentbody">Those who really like two-letter abbreviations might be better served by LaunchBar or Quicksilver. If you seek the certainty of language, why mess about with abbreviations squeezed onto little squares? 

Want to open Photoshop? 
Trigger Launchbar, then type "PS" - and weigh, hay, up she rises.
Or type "Photoshop."
Or key in "Adobe Phot."

In the early days of the Mac, icon designers adhered to the notion that icons ought to be, you know, <em>iconic</em> - that their form should reflect the thing that they signified.    Not so, these new linguistic squares.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks William and Stephen.

I began making them just as a joke for this thread and an excuse to push some pixels. God, how I love pixels, and miss DPaint3 on my old Amiga 1200 :(

Stephen, you're right, the Ps icon was intended to be a photographic slide which I now think was a crap choice. Here's an updated set...

If anyone feels like turning them into a working icon set then that would be groovy. Just let me know first. And send me a copy :)

I will make them available under a 'Send Me A Plane Ticket To Australia License Agreement' ;)

I lied about the last version being the last. But it's because I have a pixel addiction.
