  body: "Don\u2019t think so. Dot on the \u2018i\u2019 is bigger in the sample.\r\nTop
    and bottom of \u2018a\u2019, \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018s\u2019 seem straight and
    uncurved in sample.\r\nMaybe a rendering issue, but I don\u2019t think so."

  body: "Jan, agreed, that\u2019s exactly why I added a question mark to my comment
    \u2013 the differences might be due to the rendering, but it could be a different
    typeface just as well. Hard to say for sure without more characters, or a larger
    sample."
