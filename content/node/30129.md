  know what this is?\r\n\r\nI mentioned in my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30041\">previous
  post</a> that I was looking for a similar face; it's simple and geometric but also
  slightly proprietary and highly usable."

  body: "Touch\xE9 Grot. I actually love Neutraface.\r\n\r\nI was with a couple of
    designers when I spotted this sign (and took an awful phone pic) and I asked them
    if this was Neutra and they thought not. Clearly you and Patty are right.\r\n\r\nIt's
    just the x-height that kills me. I think if we're willing to deal with a severe/contrasty
    x-height, then we'll just stick with Verlag (although Neutraface has a much nicer
    italic)."

  body: Ooh, I love Verlag. It has slightly less personality than Neutraface, but
    that makes it more versatile, I think.

  body: "We might move forward with Verlag knowing that:\r\n<ul><li>the x-height has
    a lot of personality and looks unusual in certain lowercase or title case configurations</li>\r\n<li>the
    numerals and punctuation are an interesting 80% height (i.e. uniformly higher
    than the x-height but lower than the cap height)</li>\r\n<li>and the italic blends
    a bit too much with the roman</li></ul>\r\nOf course, nothing's perfect."

    There are some savants hanging around here.
