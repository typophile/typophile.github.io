    of noncharacters here. As an example, within the Greek block, there are some characters
    listed as \"reserved\" (e.g. U+03A2) and other characters which are not so listed,
    but which are still unassigned (e.g. U+0378).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    of code points that are intentionally not used to represent assigned characters.
    These code points are known as noncharacters. They are permanently reserved for
    internal use and should never be used for open interchange of Unicode\r\ntext.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n(Note
    the <em>permanently reserved</em> here.) This is used for 'internal use only',
    for codes that would *never* indicate a displayable glyph, such as the BOM and
    the codes for switching RTL/LTR.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of \"reserved\" is simply
    'not (yet) in use'. Most blocks contain some reserved -- unassigned -- codes at
    the end, which is probably just to align the start of the <em>next</em> code block
    on a round hexadecimal number. Also, this free space can be used to add one or
    two useful characters to an existing block."

    If ever GREEK CAPITAL LUNATE \r\nSIGMA needed a place to hang its curvy hat, it
    is surely U+03A2. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere is no rhyme or reason to individual
    glyph assignments. In this case, someone thought it might be possible for a valid
    character to appear -- an uppercase equivalent of the lowercase pair \"final sigma/regular
    sigma\". In other cases, code points may simply have been removed from the specification."

  body: "Ah, wait: you are wondering when a code points is \"officially <em>declared</em>
    reserved\"!\r\n\r\nWell ... in the example of U+03A2 above, the codes clearly
    run parallel from uppercase to lowercase, per design. So the code point U+03A2
    would <em>logically</em> be 'uppercase terminal sigma'; but, because there is
    no such beast (as yet), the code point is \"reserved for (possible) future use\".
    Whereas other code points are simply 'left over' and could be used for anything."

    \u201Creservation\u201D has nothing to do with whether the <em>glyph</em> (I would
    say <em>character</em>) is \u201Cdisplayable\u201D.  The codes for switching RTL/LTR
