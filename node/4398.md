  body: Not sure about the main text, which looks like something out of a Celtic high
    school year book, but the numerals are very close to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/american-uncial/american-uncial/testdrive.html?s=2003&amp;p=60">American
    Uncial</a> or similar.

  body: Thats great thanks, but I still need the main font! Or would anybody be able
    to write for me in the same style &#34;Mini- &#34; so that I could stick it in
    front? Thanks again!
