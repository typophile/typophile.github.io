  like the \"SEARCH\" box and the main headers, like when you click on \"FORUM\" or
  \"PROJECTS\"\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: " Perhaps this font changes each month but the one used now (3-6-08) is not
    FF Clan Pro. Also, I don't see a right hand column listing the font name in my
    browser (Firefox).\r\n What I did do is look at the coding of this web page and
    found that the heading font for this thread (\"Typophle site fonts\") is retrieved
    by the following shockwave-flash object:\r\n  http://www.typophile.com//sites/all/themes/typophile/swfs/Headline.swf\r\nwhich
    you see uses the name \"Headline\". If you go to this URL you will see a bit of
    this font.\r\n  A similar bit of code using the name \"GothamBold\" retrieves
    that font elsewhere on the page.\r\n What I haven't found yet is any font named
    \"Headline\" or with \"Headline\" in the name that matches this heading font.
    Does anyone know what this font is?\r\n Thanks, Ray"

    This is how it shows up when I disable my ad blocker:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beorcana_5598.png]\r\n\r\nThus,
    right now, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/42775\">the featured face </a>

  body: Florian, Thanks. That was the problem. The web filtering of one my firewalls
    was blocking this. I am trying to make a rule for the Typophile site to let this
    through so I don't have to turn off the firewall temporarily each time to check
    the featured font. Ray
