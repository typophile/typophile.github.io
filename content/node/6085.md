body: I was interested in this book because of the author, but the lettering on the
  cover closed the deal... can anyone tell where the face is from? I&#39;m pretty
  sure &#40;from the scaled-up lower case&#41; that it&#39;s not custom-drawn. <BR>

  body: It&#39;s an old film font called Scanner. No doubt it&#39;s been digitized,
    but not under that name as far as I know.

    also shown in the link above, is the closer in the style that I have found, digitized
    or not. Beeing kind of close in time, could it be from the same company or designer
    Stanley Davis? I know it doesn&#39;t mean much, just a monday thought.

  body: I have another catalog which lists it as &#34;Cucumber.&#34; LOTR, if you&#39;re
    referring to a Photo-Lettering Inc. catalog, that&#39;s probably the original
    name.

  body: In the Photo-Lettering Catalog &#40;Alphabet Thesaurus Vol. 3&#41; from 1971,
    it is shown as Cucumber. It also appears by that name in the Phil&#39;s Photo
    &#39;Homage to the Alphabet&#39; book from 1985. Was that the one you saw it in
    Mark?

  body: No, it was in a Lettergraphics catalog. Lettergraphics was known to traffic
    in counterfeit fonts which is why I was suspicious of the name. So Cucumber must
    be the original name. It fits, too.
