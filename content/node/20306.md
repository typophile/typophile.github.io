  body: "Great font. This is probably a dumb question but is it monospaced?\r\n\r\nTo
    me the L and F have some strange spacial weirdness happening which is making them
    look less balanced than the other letters. The A and the V seem slightly off too,
    maybe rounding the inside top intersection like the O would work or maybe having
    the diagonals begin lower on the V and higher on the A? \r\n\r\nThe 4 (maybe because
    of the diagonal) looks too wide. Also the bold at sign looks a little crowded.
    \r\n\r\nThe J is really great."

  body: I love it, but I think just "Dusseldorf" would make a better name. You could
    use dream to specify the font; "Dusseldorf Snooze" for the thin type & "Dusseldorf
    Dream" for the bolder one. And if you decide to do a black version of the font,
    you could always call it "Dusseldorf R.E.M." ;-)

  body: "thanks for the feedback guys! some great points to explore there thanks colin.
    \r\n\r\nmy design teacher always told me \"never trust a font named after a city\"...
    seems i've gone full circle."

  body: "I think  a stronger/longer spur on the Q would be good. The Joins are get
    messy like at the top of the A, The base of the W, Top of the M. The letters can
    look cleaner if you tweak them. I like your J too but I would like the top to
    be slighty less long. It would be funkier that way. I think the 4 is weak. I think
    it needs to be tweaked or redone. I think a stronger bend in the left top curve
    would do it.\r\n"
