  would see drawn in such identities and what you miss actually. What are dreamforms
  most people like them? If someone found favours on logos: please mail me! Of course
  I would change and finish to customer wish and optimize for purpose.\r\n\r\nwadim@kahlkopf.com"

  body: The first one looks like a logo for a heavy medal band. The second one would
    be a stretch for a jeans company. Maybe a secondary brand. Both Mens and Womans
    Jeans need to be pushed a squoosh to the right to balance the weight with the
    line above them. I would also ask you to develope them as black and white solutions.
    The jeans line especially being they have either printing or embrodery restrictions.
    Good work keep going
