body: Hi there  <BR> <BR>this is a logo for an internet newspaper having to do with
  news about agriculture &#40;mainly economical information&#41;. Their site is <a
  href="http://www.agronews.gr" target="_blank">www.agronews.gr</a>. They want to
  keep dark &amp; light green so there is no alternative in colours. <BR> <BR>Happy
  if i hear from anyone soon... <BR> <BR>christos <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47501.gif"

  body: Christos, Version 1. I don&#39;t understand the eye &#40;seed?&#41;. I in
    general don&#39;t like all caps, but do like the weight change between Agro and
    News. Version 2. Says tree farmers not broad enough. Version 3. I like the graphic,
    much more broad based and growing. Loose American Typewriter. Version 4. You were
    uninspired, don&#39;t even show these. Version 5. I like the abstract A treatment
    with the Initial cap treatment. Nice start!

  body: 'I think the two on 1b are nice &#40;though I think the logos should have
    a more organic feel&#41;. I like # 2 the most, It&#39;s clean and balanced but,
    can mountains be associated with agriculture or are they trees?.  <BR>I don&#39;t
    particularly like the two on row 5, It&#39;s seems like it&#39;s been done to
    many times &#40;the lines representing rows of crops&#41;. Well that&#39;s my
    imput, I think you&#39;re going in a good direction. Hope I&#39;ve helped some.

  body: Wait a minute, I didn&#39;t even scroll to the left to see the rest. Anyway,
    I am in agreement with Daniel&#39;s comment. 3b looks good, but to me the brush
    strokes seem a little off, can&#39;t really describe it. Play around with it some
    more. <BR> <BR>IM

  body: '#3 and #5 are your stereotypical ag logos. The green isn&#39;t helping them
    stand out either. Great marks, but just overused symbols in the industry. <BR>
    <BR>I like 1 a lot, though I see more of a tree in the eyeball...maybe try using
    a sprout?'

  body: darrel, being an information site rather than a design site, I think he could
    get away with any sterotypical cliche, the viewers of that site don&#39;t care
    about uniqueness, they want information. Design to the audience, don&#39;t overthink
    the process and spend the money on good website design.

  body: 'First of all i have to say that there was almost no brief at all. There is
    nobody who has clear in the mind what exactely they want, so i tried to give a
    variety of choices, from the very stereotypical and bold &#40;as #5&#41; to a
    more friendly and playfull logo &#40;#1A and the logo i send now&#41;. I also
    wrote a text under each case explaining them the messages every logo express so
    then they can make a decision on which way they want to go. <BR> <BR>For the moment
    i would go to 1 and 3.  <BR> <BR>Ivan: for #3 i can&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong
    and if you have an idea to &#34;cure&#34; the balance please tell me so.  <BR>
    <BR>Daniel: I agree that loose kerning of typewriter would give a more &#34;press&#34;
    look.  <BR> <BR>Darrel: i tried to make the tree more descriptive but i was loosing
    the eye. <BR> <BR>I will send any progress but first i have to wait the feedback
    from the client. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for the quick and helpfull response. <BR>

  body: '&#34; I think he could get away with any sterotypical cliche&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    been to several agribusiness trade shows. The amount of cliche identities in this
    industry seems to exceed the norm. If you go to one, look down the aisle. You&#39;ll
    see row upon row of yellow/green logos with either cows &#40;if it&#39;s livestock
    based&#41; or fields &#40;if crop based&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I agree...one shouldn&#39;t
    overthink a logo, as the logo isn&#39;t THE important item. But, if you have the
    chance now to veer a bit from the predictable, you&#39;ll be thankful later on.
    <BR> <BR>As for the eye logo, I&#39;d drop the tree. Tree doesn&#39;t really say
    agriculture to me. That says more forestry.'

  body: I can see strengths in all of these.  <BR> <BR>1a seems very CBS and maybe
    not very friendly, but I saw the <BR> eye and the tree straight away. I actually
    really like 1B with all  <BR>caps more than the all lowercase. The all caps seem
    to support  <BR>the logo more. Besides, it isn&#39;t as if that is the only way
    it will be  <BR>used. 5a and 5b are very sturdy, very nice incorporation of the  <BR>fields.
    4a and 4b are probably a little too organic, not quite  <BR>complete somehow.
    3a and 3b are very strong. I actually like the  <BR>use of American Typewriter,
    it sort of hints at news via  <BR>typewriters. But I suppose Myriad is stronger
    and safer. 2a is  <BR>nice but the door doesn&#39;t say as much as the eye does.
    <BR> <BR>My vote is for 1b &#40;top&#41; ... having an eye on something can also
    <BR>hint at having your finger on the pulse of something ... ergo <BR>you really
    know what is going on in your corner of the market.

  body: Darrel, as Christos noted in the beginning this is an internet newsletter
    and won&#39;t be seen in context with other agribusiness businesses. So clubbing
    the agri user over the head with something obvious isn&#39;t a bad idea. These
    are not designers.

  body: Eye is very &#34;big brother&#34; and scary like Tiffany said. Alot of farmers
    probably wouldn&#39;t like the idea of some strange agricultural news website
    &#34;looking&#34; over their shoulder. The eye seems nozy. The logo should probably
    have a growth metaphor condidering that is what farmers do, grow things, so their
    bank accounts will grow, and so other people will eat what they grow, and then
    those people will grow from the nutritional value of what has been grown. A lifecycle
    metaphor might also be nice. Or a food chain sort of thing.

  body: Yasou Christos, <BR>I do alot of work here for the Department of Agriculture.  <BR>I
    like 1-b the best.  I saw the eye, a microphone, a seedling bursting up through
    soil, and a tree &#40;or cotton&#41; growing. The outside reminds me of stripped
    cropping or contour furrows. <BR>#5 I know I have seen before somewhere else.  The
    others are too much trees and not enough agriculture. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: 1b with the lowercase. I would use a soft font such as Cronos/Today Sans.
    I would be interested to see how FF Cocon looked with the icon because it has
    similar qualities, although it may be too much.

  body: 'Thank you all people for your critic. <BR> <BR>I was really worring if the
    eye was clear enough and felt happy to know that most of you can recognize it.
    It is true that now i look over 1A reminds of CBS but this logo is almost unknown
    in Greece &#40;especially to farmers&#41; so there is no feeling about it. I liked
    David&#39;s idea with the food chain because it would also show the economical
    dimension of the process but i think it would be really difficult to keep boldness
    and simplicity illustrating  such a story. To be honest i liked more the 1A both
    as shape and typography. <BR> <BR>But the decision has been made. The client chose
    #5 -because he was feeling safe with it- even that he liked more #1. Actually
    i was expecting this. I know that maybe is one of the most boring logos i ever
    designed but its success or failure will be proved by the time. <BR> <BR>Thank
    you all again, have a nice day <BR> <BR>christos'
