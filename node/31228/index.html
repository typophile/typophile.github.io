  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings all, just wanted to let you know that <cite>Helvetica</cite> will have its World Premiere at the <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/film">South by Southwest Film Festival</a> in Austin, Texas, on March 13th. I'll be there to answer questions and buy drinks, along with a few designers from the film, TBA. There will be two more screenings of the film at SXSW later that week, and then screenings at other film festivals museums, colleges, and design conferences. We'll be posting our preliminary <a href="http://www.helveticafilm.com/screenings.html">screening schedule</a> later this week, and planning another 100 or so screenings worldwide for the next few months, so stay tuned.

Thanks to all of you on Typophile for all your help. Look for the Typophile "thanks" in the film's credits!

Cheers,

-Gary

How long do you guess your film will tour for? 

I think I am getting the 'art flix' in rep up here 7-9 months after they showed in LA/NYC. I am in AK. What about a showing at Typecon 2007? Is that possible? 

I know, soooo greedy!</div>

Screening in Alaska = unsure...

Congratulations on this effort. I have a certain CH awareness because my partner is Swiss (she lived in St. Gallen) which prompts this question: is there going to be a full cycle of distribution around the ol' Heimat? Just from the point of view of patrimony/local pride, I would hope so.</div>

Bruce, the film will have its Swiss premiere March 24 at the Museum für Gestaltung Zürich, part of a Helvetica 50th birthday party of sorts organized by Lars Müller and the museum, with panel discussions, exhibits, afterparty, etc. There will be several more screenings in other Swiss cities to follow. </div>

Hi Thierry. I was under the impression from Lars that the auditorium space there held 300 or 400 people... maybe it's a different space than you're thinking of? And there should be ticket info soon, on the Museum's website perhaps. And an afterparty...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I relied too much on this thread. On the other hand I was in Florida at the time (I assume) the tickets went on sale, and I don't think I could have acted that quickly, especially considering I was trying to set up a group with my students. I will join the mailing list and hope for the best concerning a second screening.

BTW, the panel discussion seems to have been moved to the day following the screening... How will the admission for that be handled? And will the second screening have a Q&A (with whom?) as well?

And something minor: the USC page claims it's the West Coast premiere of the movie. From what I can tell it's not even the 2nd West Coast showing, but the 3rd.

It's mentioned <a href="http://www.businessofdesign.com/archives/2006/05/whos_job_is_it_1.html" target="_blank">here</a>:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helvetica_Garamond_4153.gif]I guess, the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/teapotthecat" target="_blank">t-shirt</a> based on that poster is no longer available.
Would you settle for this design?

It was well-made, enjoyable and most of all superbly balanced in its commentary. Not to be missed, and the perfect opening salvo for more movies about fonts, please!

My favorite parts were Spiekermann's razor wit & insight,
and Mike Parker's amazing gushing concerning Swiss notan.

Like most great documentaries, you need to see it more than once -- there's just too much going on to absorb in one sitting.  :-)

So the DVD is #1 on my list for Christmas, particularly with the extended interviews Gary promised.  Bring on more Spiekermann!

Nice after-party, with food courtesy of Veer: I'm not keen on noisy crowds, but I stayed long enough to meet Gary and have a quick chat.  

So when is the soundtrack album coming out?  :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The first thing I thought about when I read this was that I didn't think Meta was especially designed with some kind of serif form as a starting point. Quite the opposite. Instead it was new thinking and addressed the typographic needs of the sans in a direct and unmediated way. That was and is its strength as I see it. I am not saying that Meta is some kind of ultimate golden standard* but it seems like an especially well known face that also clearly works exceptionally well - and specifically as a result of thinking outside of the box Martin sets up. It also represents a certain point in Type history when the frame for thinking about all of this shifted away from Martin's model. At least it seems this way to me. 

*Actually there are myriad examples but I don't want to leave anyone out.

About the italics: When you say it's about the slant, what angle ( or range of angles ) seems more in the ideal range to you? I am keen on the slant in OurType's Amalia.</div>

That's a nice italic, Eben; thanks for pointing to it. 

It has at least three different slants: upper case, x-height letters, and ascenders and descenders. Old style italics have even more. Here she has a variety but simplifies. It is the chirographic influence, creatively assimilated, that makes it especially nice ;)   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, I've never used Scala, but I've admired it in many places, and it's one of the best new digital text and sans faces, which is saying a lot. I don't however remember seeing the sans used as a companion to the serif, so I'm not sure how it well it works, though both can work well on their own. 

As to the principle of the thing, I don't don't agree that it's a principle. To me, it's  just a matter of what the designer can manage pull off. If you can pull off a really good serif and sans and have them work together, that's great. As I remember, Stephen Coles did a list somewhere of families with both a good serif and sans, and there are surprisingly few. Scala is one of them, maybe the premier one, so hats off to Martin Majoor. 

However, people also successfully match serif text fonts with different sans headings all the time, so no, I don't see that it's a requirement or inherently wrong just to do a sans independently. Many experienced (i.e., not me) type designers say that the chances of success are much greater with a clear brief, and that seems to me enough--I don't see why it should be inherently worse than designing a serif first. Eg. Frutiger, designed for Charles de Gaulle airport is fabulous and didn't have a serif first. 

Ps. "It's all over the place" doesn't quite capture it, because she is quite systematic. She chose a certain logic to the different slants and made it work.  </div>

He actually doesn't criticise Frutiger's Sans romans as lacking because they didn't have a serif first. He does criticise their companion italics for being sloped romans instead of true italic characters. That's another can of worms, but different. It's debatable what kind of italic best with what sans designs. I don't know enough about it to have an opinion.</div>

Not directly no. But indirectly yes, because they don't derive from romans. It was his method he criticised. I don't think there is any getting around that. Indirectly & directly he is giving Adrian a bit of a bash in the article. I am not sure he isn't correct about the real italics.

Hrant, you are in favor of slanted romans if I recall correctly. That's right isn't it?

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, thinking about this further, my feeling is that Majoor is making a mistake of thinking that there is *one* best way to do things in type. 

Now, there are definitely *better and worse* ways of doing italics. The sloped roman of Romulus--otherwise great face--is to my eyes a failure, in that it is dull and lifeless by comparison to the roman, and thus also is weak as an emphasis companion for the roman.

But Perpetua's italic, which is largely a slanted roman, with the only 5 italic forms in the lower case and 2 in the upper--and some additional shaping of bowls--is wonderful.  

Majoor's idea of designing a serif and then a companion sans I suspect is a very good idea. 

But I don't get how this is related to the issue of the italic. After all, the italic is a different alphabet than the roman. His argument that Helvetica should have had an italic based on Walbaum Italic because it was based on Walbaum I don't follow at all. It might work, but it might not. The eye is the arbiter, not a pedantic view of what historical precedent needs to be followed and what not. 

I am all in favor of being inspired by theory to try new things--theory as inspiration. But when theory becomes doctrinaire, limiting possibilities, I think it can be harmful. 

ps. Majoor's analysis of how following the skeleton of the high-contrast Walbaum with a relatively mono-line sans resulted in excessively closed forms is right on. And the quote from Paul Rand is great. </div>

Yup.

<cite>the italic is a different alphabet than the roman + This is not a beneficial view of things.</cite>

Bill, when you say that it's a different alphabet you mean that it's forms are distinct. That seems like an easy observation to agree with. 

Hrant, when you say it's not a beneficial point of view you are just getting at the idea that the sloped roman aught not to be dismissed utterly & dogmatically correct? Or are you saying that what's wrong with 'real' italics is their greater afinity of form with their chirographic roots? Or both perhaps? Anyway what is it that you are getting at?

I think Martin doesn't support his thory well enough because his prescription of following  a serif ( while it looks bang-on in terms of a speculative history of the root of helvetica's forms ) did also result in the closed forms he so rightly criticises. What I am saying is that his example seems to argue against his alter assertion rather than supporting it. He might argue that a more suitable serif would result ina better solution but I think Erik Speikermann's approach not to leave out Andre Gutler's Haas Unica seems far closer to the ideal.  

<cite> Skeletons are for biology students. </cite>

When you say this I wonder about the broader picture of how a sans would be used. Martin   is thinking in terms of a serif & sans family. I have been thinking in terms of a serif on it's own. Probably if you want to make a matched set of families paying some attention to 'skeletons' could have some degree of value as a starting point if not as a determanistic model. But I am not sure I like the idea of matched families all that well. It seems like matching different faces gives a more plesant complex and resonant result provided it is done well.  </div>

This is typical of the chirographically inclined.
Think of their characteristic notan lip-service.

In terms of saving development time/thought, yes.

Enough so you can't miss it (which means that so-called "upright Italics" cannot work) but not so much that you're tempted to fixate on it from the previous line; and without skewing the atmosphere of the whole.

BTW -  'Network' was your word in the interview. You seemed to be talking about a network of forms - it did actiually seem applicable. 

It sounds like the best shot I have at understanding what you mean is in "a cheap paperback novel called The Interior Life by Katherine Blake".

		<div class="commentbody">Actually it did sound a lot like you were talking about Patria's Italic scheme! Well, obviously I do like such a scheme. :-)  BTW, you might also notice that: the x-height is slightly smaller; it's narrower; and some forms have been changed*. I employed such a full battery of differences between the Italic and Roman because of the slightness of the slant.

* Not because of chirography, and not to trick fellow type designers into liking it (although this is not a tactic entirely without merit :-) but because of aesthetics.

Reading Robert Norton's Types Best Forgot on the bus today I came across an Alastair Johnston quote "Helvetica spread further like Velveeta cheese" and he also uses the name Velveetica. Although the earlier reference pre-dates this one, this might be the source of Hrant's t-shirt idea? Then again maybe people have been using it in the typo-underground since 1987 or even earlier.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just finished editing the DVD extras last week. It's about 100 minutes of additional interview footage, with almost everyone in the film getting several extra clips. Vignelli rants about "the flower children," Spiekermann rants about Arial, Crouwel explains his Proposal for a New Alphabet, Hoefler and Frere-Jones discuss the process behind Gotham, Mike Parker talks about Jackson Burke and Mergenthaler in the '60s, Matthew Carter on the lower case "e," Michael Bierut on branding, Zapf on Zapf, Paula Scher on the "mean" Modernists, and oh so much more. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll see more of Michael C. Place's hairless cats. 

October 9 will be the release date for the DVD in North America, and it should be close to that (maybe a week or two later) in most European countries. We'll have pre-order info (and a better description of the extras) online by TypeCon...

		<div class="commentbody">I bought the DVD a long time ago, and today had finally a chance to see the film on the big screen, as it's showing three times on the Love and Anarchy, Helsinki International Film Festival. Two of the shows are already sold out.
The bigger viewing was very enjoyable. The film shown came from a DVD, is it on film at all?</div>
