body: "We would like to share with the community the release of our lastest project
  called Neuron.\r\n\r\nNeuron is a fresh and modern sans-serif family with a neutral
  and soft appearance that make it very versatile. Its possibilities are increased
  not only by the inclusion of true italics but by the coverage of Latin, Central
  European and Cyrillic characters also. The italic variants have a slight cursive
  influence but keep their sleekness at the same time.\r\n\r\n<img src=http://typophile.com/files/banderas_neuron2_behance.jpg>\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nSergio"

  body: 'sardiez, Who is "we"? Is this "release" available for licensing? Is there
    a link for this? Is there a link for a home page for the font? Is there a link
    for a type specimen? I like the font, but your announcement about what is going
    on is lacking. '

  body: "@hrant:\r\nThanks! nice to read that! We tried hard to make a real italic
    set but keeping the simplicity of the upright versions.\r\n\r\n@J. Tillman:\r\nThanks
    for the feedback, sorry about the lack of info. We are Manuel Corradine and Sergio
    Ram\xEDrez (the person writting here) both created this family. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/neuron\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> is a link to its display page on MyFonts if you want
    to see more. No pdf specimens or special websites have been made yet. Thanks for
    visiting.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nSergio"
