  especially for a PostScript or TrueType font intended for print applications? <BR>
  <BR>Further, can you offer suggestions on good systematic ways to accomplish effective
  hinting? <BR> <BR>The reason I ask is that I have noticed that some of my own fonts
  print perfectly well when I send them to a service bureau, but they can jump and
  bounce when I print them in small sizes on my 600 d.p.i. laser printer -- sometimes
  producing jarring results. I&#39;d really like to solve this problem before I begin
  marketing them. <BR> <BR>Any help, suggestions or references would be most appreciated!

  body: ' I&#39;m no expert on hinting &#40;I&#39;ve just finished my first serious
    project with VTT&#41;, but hinting is very important for ensuring quality on medium-res
    output. By medium-res I mean like between 200 to 1000 dpi. As you say, in hi-res
    it&#39;s not important. Where I disagree with most hinting people is in the area
    of low-res &#40;below ~200 dpi&#41;: I&#39;m yet to be convinced that good old-fashioned
    bitmaps don&#39;t make more sense for text &#40;if not display&#41; at those resolutions.
    Basically, the only way to get good results at like 12-20 PPEM using hinting is
    to resort to delta hints, and that makes no sense at all. And then there&#39;s
    the area of grayscale rendering, and at that point delta hinting totally falls
    apart, in terms of cost-effectiveness. <BR> <BR>So, to me, &#34;global&#34; hinting
    &#40;like to make the stems of a lc &#34;n&#34; equal across the range of PPEM
    sizes&#41; is very important &#40;and it will be for another few years&#41;, but
    pixel-specific hinting &#40;like for screen display&#41; is just backwards. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, take note that the auto-hinting in Fog4 is flawed. <BR> <BR>hhp '
