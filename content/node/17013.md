  body: "If you slant Philip Bouwsma's <a href=\"http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/MI203304\"
    target=\"new\">'Neuhengen'</a>, you get something quite close to this. (Based
    on the the style of the 'a', this may be an obliqued version of a Roman font --
    it's not usually the way an Italic 'a' is drawn.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
