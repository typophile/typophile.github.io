body: "Lost and unawhere\r\nAt any cost, we must reach higher and thinner air\r\nThese
  spinners on my sneakers dare you\r\nAnd although all these damn scarecrows know
  the truth\r\nThe lies have always shown through\r\nAnd though your houndstooth and
  roundteeth astound me\r\nI found you alive but asleep\r\nWrapped in wine vines and
  greif\r\nTrying to wind down is like trying to pull that enamel camel hump\r\nOut
  your mouth like silver dollars out of a beggar pan handle\r\n\r\ni never surrendered\r\ni
  never gave up and said fuck this love i worked so hard to find\r\nyou're the dime
  i always knew that i deserved\r\n\"Word?\"\r\nyea, you're pretty purty like a sight
  for sore eyes\r\nand when i'm old and barely alive and i wanna drive you\r\nout
  your f*cking mind, ma'am\r\nyou can tell your bridge group\r\n\"that old fool's
  my old man\""
