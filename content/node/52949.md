body: "\r\n\r\nI may be a bit misleading in the subject but Robert Bringhurst and
  David Blatner have mentioned it their books about setting H1, H2, Body etc so they
  share the same baseline without having to set to baselne, okay not so well explained
  but will try again\r\n\r\nIf I set the H1 to be 18/10 H2 12/16 and Body as 10/18
  that is should share the same baseline or be lining up when I have columns of text,
  its just that I dont have my books with me to check this out and know that both
  those books explain how to do it so they line up with having to set in indesign
  align to basegrid etc.\r\n\r\nDid I kinda make sense or you know what Im trying
  to say?\r\nAll critique welcome! \u203A\r\n\r\n"

    typefaces are used to display a webpage & most browsers use the top offset of
    a font to render type, and not the baseline like most page design programs. The
    different x-heights mess up sharing baselines.\r\n\r\nAlistapart published an
