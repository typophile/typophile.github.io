body: I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to use the visual TT hinting tool in FontLab
  to move one component of a composite glyph in FontLab without messing up the hinting
  of the individual component. For example, if I am hinting a composite Ecaron, and
  I want to move the caron up one pixel, adding a link to separate the outline of
  the two components messes up the caron shape. I'm looking for a way to bump the
  caron up without deforming it.

  body: Try an intermediate (M) full pixel delta. This method seems to work cleanly
    and doesn't mess up other hinting on the composites.
