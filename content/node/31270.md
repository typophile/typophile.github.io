  body: "Dear Grot Esque, Heron & Dan\r\n\r\nThanks for your help Heron2001's font
    was closer to what I was looking for and might do the job, but I really appreciate
    your help Grot!\r\n\r\nHearon2001 thanks for the bunny defense, but thats not
    why..i actually owned two pet bunnies so I just love bunnies thats where my name
    comes from...as far as the font Dan they why is I have a job to do for a customer
    based in new orleans and sexy girl silhouettes are hot there so her requested
    this type of font.\r\n\r\nI think he literally wanted the letters made out of
    the girl silhouettes but I think the alpha silhouette has that new orleans french
    feel.\r\n\r\nThanks All,\r\nKristen"
