body: "i have this logo here, which i should give someone critic to. I have several
  reasons why i don't like the look of that font. i think it's manually adjusted -
  beside the obvious brush strokes and splashes. I also can't stop thinking, that
  this logo reminds me of a famous brand or something. especially the \"R\" with the
  unusual long - manually extended - serif at the top and the rounded, rather blunt
  - but cut off - serif at the bottom.\r\nI think the weight of the font was also
  bungled with. and I'm not sure if the font is actually an oblique font face. not
  many oblique \"f\" go without a descender.\r\n\r\nhas anyone an idea, what font
  this logo is based on? and has someone else a already existing logo in mind, when
  seeing this?"

  body: "It looks like it has had a lot of stroke thickness added to it, and as you
    said the extensions of the R were added (awkwardly, I think). The slant does look
    imposed, and the e's look distorted. My guess would be Bookman, as the baseline
    font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
