body: "Using FontLab 5, Windows.\r\nI'm creating an OTF font from a few Type1 fonts.
  One of the type one fonts is a small cap font. To get the kerning pairs from the
  old Type1 font into my new font I thought I could pull the Type1 into FontLab and
  export the AFM file. Then open the AFM in a text editor and change all the lowercase
  characters to my small cap glyphs.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n    KPX A c -18\r\nbecomes\r\n
  \   KPX A Csmall -18\r\nwhere Csmall is the name of my small cap c. But it isn't
  working and I can't see why!\r\n\r\nFrom the AFM file I'm also deleting all the
  kern pairs I won't need, like:\r\n    KPX A T -74\r\nas it's already in there from
  having procesed the \"regular\" text.\r\n\r\nWhen all my substitutions are made
  in the AFM file I change the StartKernPairs line to reflect the number of pairs
  I now have.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to import the modified AFM into FontLab it
  doesn't import any kern pairs, even if I tell it to completely replace them. I'm
  able to import kerning from other AFM files but I don't see any difference in structure
  between the ones that import and the one that won't. What am I missing?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any insight\r\nKen"

  body: It appears that you need to change glyph names in the character metrics section
    too, i.e. in the list between keywords <em>StartCharMetrics</em> and <em>EndCharMetrics</em>.

  body: "Hi Ken,\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if the \"number of kern pairs\" line is
    corrrect.\r\n\r\nTry this: In your existing OpenType font, which does have the
    small caps, but does not have the small cap kerning, export an AFM.\r\n\r\nNow,
    working in a text editor, from the Type 1 font AFM you've pared down so that all
    KPX pairs contain at least one small cap, copy only the KPX portion, and paste
    that at the bottom (doesn't really matter, just easier) of the KPX portion of
    the AFM you exported from the OT version. (A lot of words trying to be clear.
    It is really very simple. You could export a AFM from the OT version and type
    in new KPX pairs. Just cut & paste instead.)\r\n\r\nSave the AFM file and reimport
    into the FontLab OTF file.\r\n\r\nYou'll see immediately in the dialog box the
    number of new pairs FL found, and added. If it's \"zero\" added you have a problem,
    most likely a disagreement of glyph *names*\r\n\r\nAs Karsten says, the glyphs
    in the kerning (KPX) portion must be matched in the character metrics portion.
    For me anyway, the above copy & paste technique offers the least chance for error
    with the greatest chance to figure out what went wrong."

    the normal font into the mask of the small cap font</li>\r\n<li>Step through all
    the glyphs and mark those that are different from the mask</li>\r\n<li>Add .sc
    to the glyph names of all marked glyphs</li>\r\n<li>Export AFM (now contains the
    correct .sc glyph names automatically)</li>\r\n<li>Copy the .sc glyphs from the
    small cap font to normal font (or use Merge Fonts function)</li>\r\n<li>Import
    AFM into the merged font, choosing option \"add kerning to existing\" or whatever
    it's called</li>\r\n</ul>"
