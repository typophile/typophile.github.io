  body: There&#39;s a &#34;feeware&#34; font called &#34;Cuckoo&#34; &#40;can be found
    at several locations on the web. It might well be a rip-off of something else

  body: Linotype&#39;s <a href="http://www.linotype.com/90528/zipper-family.html"
    target="_blank"> Zipper</a> is in the ballpark. <BR> <BR>I thought that buyfonts,
    or Opti-Castcraft had something similar.  <BR>Seems like we&#39;ve had one of
    these reverse-contrast fonts here before.

  body: Cuckoo is it! Thanks. <BR> <BR>Sort of annoying to find a megacorporation
    using a freebie, eh? <BR>Well, at least it&#39;s a pretty interesting design.

  body: I think BJ&#39;s right about Buyfonts having one like this. It&#39;s their
    digitization of a font called Global, which they called <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/glockenspiel.htm"
    target="_blank">&#39;Glockenspiel&#39;.</a>

  body: The fonts at BuyFonts were done by FontBank in the early-mid 1990&#39;s. FontBank
    actually included a list of the  proper typeface names for many of the fonts.
    Global was the name they gave for it, I believe. I think many of these were film
    types that they had digitized. I haven&#39;t been able to find Global in any of
    my other books &#40;so far&#41;, but this is the sort of thing that either Grant
    Hutchinson or Mark Simonson often has more info about.

    called Blue Global. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Well, it was probably either that or &#34;Glowworm&#34; or something... except
    Glowworm is, of course, already taken. There really aren&#39;t that many words
    that start with &#34;Glo&#34; I guess... For a cartload of laughs you should check
    out the &#34;Typeface Analogue&#34; section of old Agfa catalogs. <BR> <BR>hhp

    body parts. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, I could have directed you to a previous occurence  <BR>of
    Cuckoo/Blue Global on this very board were the archives not <BR>so incredibly
    f&#42;&#42;&#42;ed.
