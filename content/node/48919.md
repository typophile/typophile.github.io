body: "Hello I am a senior in high school. I know I want to become an artist. The
  issue is if I want to be a Graphic Designer an illustrator or what ever is left
  out there for me to major in.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is if I should go to Tyler
  school of art, Kansas institute of art, or MICA. I have not been accepted anywhere
  yet because I need to well apply first I pretty much KNOW I want to go to one of
  these guys. I was just wondering what you guys think about me going to those places
  (if I could even make in there) and if you can think of any other good colleges
  that would fit my type of art.\r\n\r\nHere is my little deviant portfolio http://izacchemical.deviantart.com/
  now just let me know what you think about this whole situation. "

    in your mind, has kept you from already becoming one?\r\n<cite>...my type of art</cite>\r\nAfter
    looking at the pieces in your portfolio, it would be more helpful to me if you
    used words to tell me what your type of art is."

  body: "well I love my cartoony side with my characters and such, but I also love
    to manipulate photos. \r\nI am currently getting into Ai. but the thing that has
    kept me going as an artist is probably been my little characters that I make/
    style I use. Though I don't think that it will get me anywhere I still love to
    do side canvases either way. I am very comfortable with computers and has always
    wished I was the guy who made those magazine ads but the more i get into art my
    direction gets obscured on whether I should push my style forward or push my design
    and manipulation further. \r\n\r\nsorry if that was confusing or not what you
    were looking for."
