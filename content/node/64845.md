  for me is harder than I thought.. Some styles like the Slab Serif have been around
  and are still very famous. So do I look in which time they are created and try to
  fit a building with that or do I take it to the now. Hmm this wasn't that easy at
  all!\r\n\r\nOld Style \r\n - Venetian - Tempietto di San Pietro in Montorio, Rome
  -\r\n - Garalde - Caudebec-en-Caux -\r\n\r\n - Transitional - Versailles could fit
  this one -  \r\n - Modern - Frank Lloyd Wright?\r\n - Experimental - Made me think
  of Moshe Safdie - \r\n - Slab Serif - archetypical slabs - \r\n - Geo Sans Serif
  - \r\n - Monospace - Bauhaus?\r\n\r\nI'm making a booklet for school. Hopefully
  the pictures can really explain.\r\n\r\nThanks,"

  body: "IMVHO this is a very difficult task as typefaces seem to \"age\" differently
    from buildings.\r\nFor Venetian, I would look at an early Renaissance building
    in Venice - think one generation before Bramante (high Renaissance). At the time
    Venice was an independent country, not on friendly terms with Rome and Bramante
    came from Urbino.\r\nFor Garalde, I would look at Chambord.\r\nFor transitional,
    I would be careful about Versailles: most of the original works of literary people
    associated with Versailles (Racine, Corneille, Moli\xE8re, Boileau) was published
    in Venetian / Garalde faces, (perhaps some in Fournier?) AFAIK. Transitional faces
    are later than Louis XIV, in any case. You would probably be looking at work by
    Ange-Jacques Gabriel rather than Hardouin-Mansart: Place de la Concorde (erasing
    the Madeleine out of the picture); Ecole Militaire (erasing the Eiffel tower from
    the background)... Or Le Petit Trianon. Having said that, transitional faces are
    often seen as British, so a better example might come from British architecture
    (think something in Cambridge at the time of Baskerville. Perhaps the FANTASTIC
    Senate House by Gibbs? or King's fellows building or sadly the Radcliffe Camera
    in Oxfart)?\r\n\r\nIf by Modern, you mean Didot etc. you are looking at the generation
    just after Gabriel - that of neo-classicism. Arc de Triomphe of Paris ? (of course,
    an Italian neo-classical building would make sense too, since Bodoni may have
    initiated the genre - look at Parma?).\r\n\r\nI am not sure what you mean by experimental?\r\nSlab
    Serif is a difficult one. Which typeface do you have in mind? Probably a Victorian
    building from London would make sense for Clarendon.\r\n\r\nBauhaus: check ITC
    Bauhaus etc.\r\n\r\nGeo sans: tough one. Which typeface do you have in mind?\r\n\r\nFkoors,
    I may be wrong."

    modern typefaces (Bodoni, Didot), I'd say Boull\xE9e instead.\r\n\r\n"

    is very hard to define. Experimental Architecture is in that case more easy to

  body: "For the experimental : you need to contextualise each experimental typeface
    I am afraid. minuscule would probably be right with something like the Rue des
    Suisses in Paris by Herzog & DeMeuron, no? I am not keen on Mus\xE9e du Quai Branly,
    because it is too large scale although it would be right in terms of location
    / nationality.\r\n\r\nRe: geometric. Try Futura with Bauhaus as s.o said eloquently.
    Try Avant-garde with a building from the 1970s which claimed to be modernist/Bauhaus
    (I know these are two different concepts). You could try Twentieth Century or
    even Century with an american modernist building?\r\n\r\nRe Modern: Boull\xE9e
    is good. Ledoux might even be better. (Try http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Nicolas_Ledoux#The_Royal_Saltworks_at_Arc-et-Senans_.281774-1779.29,
    which rationalises a city into curves and straight) \r\n\r\nMonospace: for me,
    it evokes an office building and pools of secretaries on typewriting machines!"

  body: "Slightly tangential, but if you're interested in historical parallels between
    type and architecture, this book might be worth a look:\r\nG Knuttel, The letter
    as a work of art: Observations and confrontations with contemporaneous expressions
    of art from Roman times to the present day (Amsterdam 1951). [Out of print, but
    check your library.]\r\nI admit I haven't actually read it yet, but it consists
    to a great part of spreads juxtaposing typefaces and art/architecture from the
    same period or in the same style, & thereby shows how the history of type is connected
    to that of other visual disciplines. I find that quite insightful."

    for Slab Serif I was thinking clarendon, memphis or serifa and I actually also
