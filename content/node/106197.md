  for logo projects.\r\n\r\nMy friend approached me about a startup she is starting
  called Lady Babka where she'll be selling her  delicious babkas at local delis.
  \r\n\r\nThe logo is still in process, but I'm a little in a rut of working on it
  so I thought I would bring it here to see what feedback you guys have to offer.
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
