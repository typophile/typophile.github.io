body: Hi, does anyone have any idea what font the attached is? Even if you know something
  thats very similar to the "g" and "e". The "g" is perfect for what I require. Many
  thanks in advance.

  body: Looks custom to me and /g totally made from scratch but could be wrong. For
    "enie", you could start with some geometric sans like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic|Avant-Garde
    Gothic]] Bold and cut crossbars. I don't know how to reproduce this /g (which
    looks terrible for me) and I don't know any font that could fit it unfortunately.
    The best way would probably be to entirely draw it. You could start for instance
    with Avant-Garde Gothic /o and add it a custom leg of your own. An easy alternative
    would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/kabel|Kabel]].

    Nice work.
