body: "I recently completed a failed font experiment, and, although I don't know if
  it's of any interest to anyone, I thought I'd share it anyway. If my wasted time
  fuels someone else's creative endeavors, then it wasn't entirely wasted.\r\n\r\nThe
  concept was weighting glyphs in a font based on their frequency of use in a given
  text canon. So, for example, my plan was to have a Shakespeare version of the font,
  a Bront\xEB version of the font, etc. The less frequently a character is used in
  the canon, the darker the character would be in the font.\r\n\r\nIn any case, a
  more detailed writeup that includes python scripts and examples [[http://www.fogbound.net/archives/2013/01/30/failures-in-typographical-experimentation/|can
  be read here.]]"

  body: "Given the application to literature it may well have yielded intriguing results
    (in that context) if applied to whole words and then if tweaked for frequency
    analysis based on selectable criteria, such as words containing particular letters,
    or more unusual words. It would be a nice feature in an e-reader and could possibly
    aid accessibility and readability, as Hrant notes.\r\n\r\nI am also reminded of
    the article <em>About the Typefaces Not Used in This Edition</em> by, Jonathan
    Safran Foer:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/dec/07/guardianfirstbookaward2002.gurardianfirstbookaward"

    you enjoyed, and nice to see something archived so well on the web! If only we
    could do the same for Typophile!"
