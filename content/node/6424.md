  <BR>Probably nothing new for Typophile regulars but nice to see typography mentioned
  in a newspaper.'

  body: While it&#39;s good that type has publicity, I find the tag which accompanies
    the slide-show to be highly offensive--&#34;The Amateurs Are Coming&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m not an amateur, and neither are the majority of regulars here at Typophile.  And
    most of the designers &#40;if not all of them&#41; featured in the slide-show
    are certainly not amateurs.   <BR> <BR>We are men and women who know and love
    type; as such, we are the only body of individuals qualified to make the type
    that will be used by such organizations as the New York Times--foolish and uninformed
    a publication as it sometimes proves itself to be.

  body: I agree whole-heartedly. I wouldn&#39;t call myself an amateur either &#40;even
    though I probably am one

  body: I think the strict definition of &#34;amateur&#34; is in contrast to &#34;professional&#34;,
    meaning it has to do with making money. So I was a professional font designer
    at 13 &#40;when I sold my Arabic bitmap fonts for the C64&#41; but some people
    will persist in calling me &#34;amateur&#34;. Mostly the terms have no objective
    meaning - they&#39;re simply used by insecure people to make themselves feel better
    by striking others down. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Well, if professional means academically educated in the specifics of a given
    field, then I&#39;m not a type designer.  The important thing here is that I really
    don&#39;t believe one requires &#34;academic&#34; training in order to be a professional.
    <BR> <BR>My introduction to type design is far from the halls of &#34;Any-art-school,
    U.S.A.&#34;  I came to this profession from the sickeningly pedantic field of
    hardcore lexicography &#40;having an intense interest in orthographic design and
    reform--later the art of the alphabet and its many potential incarnations took
    lead over the academic linguistics I had begun with&#41;. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s
    the point?  You don&#39;t need the schooling; you do need to have enough passion
    to motivate yourself to actually learn something instead of assuming that a copy
    of Fontographer makes a you a pro. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;d like to see the look
    on the face of the fool who tagged the online version of that article if they
    were ever to see how difficult it is to design a real typeface.

    advertisement&#34; <BR> <BR>2. What is the story? where is the story? <BR> <BR>3.
    What is the HOLY / &#34;HOLY&#34; thing with type design?

  body: This story shows computers make &#34;professional&#34; a distinction without
    a difference when the standards for producing a font are low compared to pre-computer
    or as early as mid-1990&#39;s. <BR> <BR>If I do a search on the web for fonts
    I get the cheap free fonts and I get calssics provided by Adobe. Who defines what
    is a real professional font? The search engines and whoever downloads and uses
    it &#40;defines what is professional&#41;, not a trained typographer.

  body: cheap free fonts <BR> <BR>This is more about education, the schools. Go to
    Type ID Board - and you&#39;ll see how many times a day/week people are  asking
    for free fonts.  <BR> <BR>And the SAD thing?  graphic designers posting a link
    - where you can download the free font. <BR> <BR> <BR>I think that Mr. Heller
    is a teacher &#40;or was&#41;. So if you want to blame a person - you can blame
    him &#40;as a teacher, of course&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t see people
    that are looking for free illustrations  &#40;editorial,political cartoon&#41;
    ? <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t see people that are looking for free scripts &#40;books,
    tv, movies&#41;? <BR> <BR>Why? <BR> <BR>=========== <BR> <BR> <BR>are low compared
    to pre-computer or as early as mid-1990&#39;s.  <BR> <BR> <BR>This is more about
    progress, development. And there&#39;s nothing wrong about that.
