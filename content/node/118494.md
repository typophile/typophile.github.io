  body: "Can you tell us how big these letters are, where they are located, and if
    possible, how long ago they were done?\r\n\r\nIf this sample is on an airplane
    hangar, I doubt it's a font, in the sense of belonging to a set of letters you
    can install on your computer and use in a design/layout program. Lettering on
    buildings is often painted by hand, either because the letters are too big to
    render any other way, or because they're on a surface that's only accessible to
    a human on a scaffold. When letters are painted this way, the painter often uses
    improvised or simplified letterforms rather than precisely rendered copies of
    a commercially-available alphabet."

  body: You will note Victor I said Lexikos is close as a font but I believe you are
    correct about the original being hand lettered and thus not a font. Many sign
    painters produced paper templates of the letter forms that they used as guides
    through pouncing.

  body: "Hello again, I'm not sure about exact dimensions (I'm working on a simulation
    software, not on the actual aerodrome) but I'd say the square is about 1,70m high
    by 0,80m wide. Have a look\r\n\r\n<img  width='600' src='http://www.awa.pt/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/avioes18.jpg'
    />\r\n\r\nAlso you can see H3 on this one\r\n\r\n<img width='600' src='http://www.awa.pt/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/avioes13.jpg'
    />\r\n\r\nLexikos seems close enough to me, the 4 is certainly wider on the photos,
    and the 3 terminates in a different way, but I can live with this approximation.\r\n\r\n"
