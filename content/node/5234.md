body: Can anyone identify this font? I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t custom designed
  for this logo, because there&#39;s other text that uses this &#34;font&#34;, but
  I lack a videocard, so, I can&#39;t take a screenshot. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38422.jpg"

  body: The tagline and the g in OKAgE is <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=129"
    target="_blank">Variex</a> &#40;the g looks a bit modified&#41;, but the other
    characters were either drawn from scratch or from some other font. The K looks
    a bit like Kabel Black, but it doesn&#39;t match exactly.
