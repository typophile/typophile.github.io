  body: The line going down on the E seems to be a little reader unfriendly, the T
    seems a little pulled up, I'm not sure about the narrowing on the U, and the V
    looks like a U.

    if you let the bottom stroke of the E start farther out ( in the middle) and take
    on that small bulb shape that is on the light stroke now. Then the light stroke
    might be more like the ones on the arms of the T. I think that would let you keep
    the idea but let the E read as an E just a little faster/better.\r\n\r\nDo you
    mind if I post a graphic suggestion for the E? Maybe it's a terrible idea...\r\n\r\nAlso
    I second what Tiff said about alternatives either coded in to be automatic or
    just available like swashes. I say this because some pairs are great together
    like the TA and SU. But TY, and as Tiff pointed out the EX are less so. The potential
    beauty of this will be greatly enhanced by a lovely consistent fit - using inconsistent
    forms if needed."

    see you suggestion. That could work, but I think maybe it will be difficult to
    coordinate it with the curved strokes (if that is your idea) without making it
    too complex. but I agree  that the E isn't the most legible.\r\n\r\nPaul & Tiffany,
    I already see this font as a unicase, there are already lower cases mixed with
    upper cases. But I don't want to have descenders or ascenders. I want to keep
    everything above the baseline and under the caps height. But I could have more
    lower case alternatives, for intance for the H, A, D.\r\n\r\nThe ligatures for

    very lively in general.It would be good if the E fit in with that.  It would be
    cool if there was one that was good for use next to flat letters on the right
    & one for round shapes and or one for use at the end of a word. The 1st one I
    made is an example of a possible end of the word design.
