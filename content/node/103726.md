body: I am looking for a appropriate font to use with some text (in English) by Plato.
  When I search for "Greek" fonts, often "Trajan" comes back. While the style of Trajan
  works well for my needs, it clearly links to Roman style. While I understand the
  Romans borrowed freely from Greek culture, I don't want to make a mistake of using
  a Trajan font if it does not really have any relation to the Greeks. If Trajan works,
  great. If there are other suggestions, I would enjoy hearing them! Thank you.

  body: Matthew Carter's Skia is akin to those two but also includes lowercase, if
    that's the direction you want to go.
