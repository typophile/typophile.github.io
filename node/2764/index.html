		<div class="commentbody">Regarding Romanian: <BR> <BR>There is a fiddle with Romanian diacritics. Earlier versions of Unicode unified the Romanian S/s with 'comma' accent below to the Turkish S/s with cedilla (U+015E/U+015F). Later, Unicode disunified these, and separately encoded the S/s with 'comma' accent (U+0218/U+0219). However, the old Windows 8-bit codepage 1255 that covers Romanian, uses the older Unicode encoding. This means that in such fonts you should use the S/s with 'comma' accent glyph in the S/s with cedilla codepoints. <BR> <BR>If you are making a multilingual OT font that needs to support both Turkish and Romanian, and also provide backwards compatibility support with the old 8-bit codepage, you need to include a Localised Forms &lt;locl&gt; OT layout feature for the Romanian &lt;rom&gt; language system tag that maps the S/s with cedilla glyphs to the S/s with 'comma' accent glyphs. Note that this substitution is not supported in currently shipping apps, but will be supported in future versions of Windows, so it is a good idea to get it in your fonts now. <BR> <BR>Unicode also previously unified T/t with 'comma' accent and T/t with cedilla (U+0162/U+0163), but later disunified these and separately encoded T/e with 'comma' accent (U+021A/U+021B). However, I have yet to locate a single language that actually uses T/t with cedilla, so the best thing to do is to include only glyphs for T/t with 'comma' accent, and <i>double encode</i> them to both the T/t with 'comma' accent codepoints and the T/t with cedilla codepoints (the latter are used in the old 8-bit codepage). <BR> <BR>Hope all this makes sense <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">FontLab 4.5 does not have 'fixed' codepages. Codepages are standards defined by national, or international standards bodies or by corporations. Windows CP 1250, for example, is defined by Microsoft, and they have not updated it to map the new Unicode character codes, since they don't like changing their codepages because of backwards compatibility issues. Since Microsoft's operating system in now 100% Unicode, they are less concerned altogether with 8-bit codepages, and support them only as compatibility formats (e.g. if you open a Cp 1250 encoded document in Word on Windows 2000+, it will be saved as a Unicode encoded document).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It should be noted that 'Eastern European' is a misnomer, since most of the languages that we're discussing are properly considered Central European. Also, Microsoft have separate codepages for 'Eastern European' (CP 1250) and 'Baltic' (CP 1257), while Apple combines support for the Baltic languages with Central European languages in a single 'MacOS CentralEurope' codepage. Conversely, Windows CP 1250 supports Romanian and Croatian, while Apple has separate codepage for each of these.  <BR> <BR>There is a small number of characters for Central, Baltic or South European languages that are not included in the Unicode Latin Extended A block. Here is a zip file that contains a FontLab .enc file that covers all the major languages of Europe, and most minority languages*, that use the Latin script. The zip also contains a .map file that maps from AGL1.0 and uniXXXX form names to correct Unicode characters; this can be used with the FontLab 'Assign Unicode' function. The .enc file should be placed in your FontLab\Encoding folder; the .map file should be placed in your Fontlab\Mapping folder. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: EuroLatinEnc_Map-33741.zip*mime_zip.gif*application/x-zip-compressed*177.9*Tiro+Euro+Latin+Basic+%2eenc+and+%2emap*EuroLatinEnc%26%2343%3bMap%2ezip --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_zip.gif" align=left alt="application/x-zip-compressed">Tiro Euro Latin Basic .enc and .map<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/EuroLatinEnc_Map-33741.zip" target="_blank"><b>EuroLatinEnc+Map.zip</b></a> (177.9 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--> <BR> <BR>Note that the .enc file is what we internally consider 'Basic', i.e. it does not contain smallcaps and glyphs for some other extended typographic features, but it does contain glyphs for case-sensitive punctuation, e.g. /hyphen.cap/ for use with the OpenType &lt;case&gt; feature. These can easily be removed from the .enc in a text editor, or simply ignored if not desired. Note also that this set contains support for some obsolete characters that are found in the Microsoft WGL4 set, e.g. /kgreenlandic/, which are included only for compatibility reasons. <BR> <BR>* I can't claim total support for all European minority languages using the Latin script, because there are some about which I do not have adequate information, and others are in a state of orthographic uncertainty.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">/aringacute/ is a Danish letter (along with the equally obscure with /aeacute/ and /oslashacute/). It is not often found in modern texts, other than dictionaries and grammars, because it was not available in the standard 8-bit character sets intended for Danish and many people got out of the habit of marking stress in Danish. Any Danish vowel can be marked as stressed, hence the need for these characters. <BR> <BR>I'm afraid I'm somewhat to blame for the Adobe Pro set not containing this character. Adobe asked me about the /aringacute/ when they were defining their set, and I told them that it wasn't used anymore except in dictionaries and grammars. Since the height of the uppercase form causes vertical metric problems, they decided not to include it, although my advice is now that it should be included because it is still an official character in the Danish orthography. Also, I didn't really realise that Adobe were asking only about the /aringacute/ and not about the other Danish diacritics /aeacute/ and /oslashacute/, so the Adobe Pro set contains the latter but not the /aringacutre/.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant writes: &quot;I've read this about Dutch too. What other languages have this wonderful feature?&quot;  <BR> <BR>In grammar books (for foreigners) and in dictionaries for Russian, acute over vowels is used to indicate syllable stress (so-called &quot;oodarenye&quot;). In Russian, the syllable stress is quite arbitrary. For example, when a verb is declinated, the stress can move from the first syllable in singular forms to last syllable in plural forms etc. The stress is very prominently pronounced: for example, an unstressed &quot;o&quot; sounds almost like a short &quot;a&quot; (something like shwa), while stressed &quot;o&quot; is a very round and clear &quot;o&quot;. Therefore, one needs to learn the proper stress for each word. When I was in school, we usually read Russian texts from textbooks where the stress was marked. Later, when we switched to reading unmarked normal texts (in newspapers etc.) it turned out to be a very difficult task <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>For comparison: in Polish, the syllable stress is almost exclusively at second-last syllable. There are relativerly few words, many of them of foreign origin, which have a different stress (e.g. third-last syllable), and many people still put it the stress to second-last syllable in these words.  <BR> <BR>This may be the reason why spoken Russian sounds quite lively while spoken Polish sounds rather dull (an opinion that I actally agree with <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>Adam</div>

<p>Alternatively, you could use GPOS mark positioning, which would be much more flexible.
