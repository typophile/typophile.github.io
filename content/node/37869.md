  enter, what would you recommend?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTom"

- body: Before you stroll down the treacherous path of producing work for competition,
    it couldn't hurt to read through a few articles about the pitfalls <a href="http://www.no-spec.com">and
    the damaging effects caused by spec work and spec-based design contests.</a>  I
    learned the hard way.  This is the number one thing I wish to GOD somebody had
    taught me when I was back in school!

  body: "Check with your local AIGA and Art Director\u2019s Club chapters for local
    contests. The fees will be lower, you\u2019ll be more likely to win, you won\u2019t
    get taken advantage of by the aforementioned spec-contests, and your work will
    be exposed to local design firms who might be hiring."

  body: There are several other student competitions as well that have national exposure.
    [[http://www.cmykmag.com/site.cfm?sect_id=10&page_id=11|CMYK]] magazine and [[http://www.cqjournal.com/contests_entries.html|Creative
    Quarterly]] are two that I've been published in with fairly low entry fees.
