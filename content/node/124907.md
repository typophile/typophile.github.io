  body: "Date of sample would help.\r\nScale is too small and somewhat blurred for
    me to say for certain, but from what I can see this looks like it was set in a
    19th century style of typeface called Scotch, originally designed by Richard Austin
    for Alexander Wilson and Son in Glasgow. In addition to the shape of the letters,
    note the width and shortness of the descenders. Numerals also match Scotch Roman.\r\nThis
    genre is well represented by the Scotch Roman of the A.D. Farmer  foundry and
    available in a Monotype digital version.  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/scotch-roman-mt/\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "This is an accounting of the Seattle fire in 1889, yes?\r\n\r\nScotch Roman
    is your best bet. There were lots of variations of the typeface, and the Monotype
    version is quite good, as digitizations go. A more modern take that I also like
    is Nick Shinn\u2019s Scotch Modern:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/"

  body: "Thanks Don, Sorry for the blurry picture but is was all i got. \r\nit was
    a sample of the Post-Intelligencer, Seatle Washington June 7, 1889 \r\n\r\nAnd
    i was looking for something similar, the scotch is a bit more 'blond' i think
    but it has that same quirky feel to it that i was looking for, so i will give
    it a go\r\n\r\nthanks again"

  body: "In 1889 newspapers were parsimonious with space.\r\nThe article was probably
    printed in a nine point or smaller lining Roman, which is the same Scotch Roman
    under another name.\r\nThe term lining means that descenders are short, which
    is a feature of Scotch Roman.\r\nThe digital versions suggested capture the letterforms
    in the newspaper article, but are based on larger point sizes.\r\nNote from this
    compilation of a lining Roman cut in the late 19th century  how the thin stokes
    become more and more hairline as the point size increases from nine to twelve
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LiningRoman510DaystromAmericanLine1906p24detail33pct_4353.jpg]\r\nTo
    correctly reproduce the article we should have a digital Scotch Roman based on
    a small point size.\r\nUnfortunately I have not been able to to locate this creature.\r\nDon"

  body: Don, i can't thank you enough, this explains the extra 'blondness' i was experiencing.
    These are some cool and logical adjustments for different sizes though!

  body: "Nick Shinn's Scotch Modern is based on an earlier version of Scotch than
    the one in the article. However the differences -- such as the base of the _2_
    -- are not major.\r\nNick Shinn's  Scotch Modern has a lower contrast than the
    Monotype digital because it used a ten point source -- which makes it a closer
    match.\r\nHowever it is only part way there.\r\nIt is possible to mimic the appearance
    of the article by putting a parallel line around the letters of either the Monotype
    or Nick Shin versions of Scotch Roman.\r\nAs a final note, bear in mind that the
    text of newspapers printed with metal type looks darker than digital types modeled
    on the metal type, or light pressure specimen proofs, because the ink spreads
    during printing.\r\nDon "

  body: "The version of Scotch Roman in Modern Extended uses more substantial semi-hairline
    strokes and would give better color than Scotch Roman MT or Scotch Modern [Nick
    Shinn]. It also has larger serifs. Both features are a better match to the 1889
    newspaper article. However, letter width of  Modern Extended  is narrower than
    the Scotch Roman in the article, which is matched by Scotch Roman MT\r\nDon"

    will probably work better in smaller sizes.  But  i will have to test that first
