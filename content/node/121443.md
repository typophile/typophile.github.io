body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nI'm having a small problem when generating my font
  with Studio 5. I'm new to this program and after looking through the manual with
  no luck and after I did some search o the internet with no luck also I thought to
  give it a try and ask here.\r\n\r\nI drew my fonts in Illustrator and they look
  nice, smooth curves, few points and everything. I import them in Studio 5 and they
  look very nice also. I hit generate font, install the font in windows and when I
  try typing with it to use it... the curves don't look nice anymore. Something happens
  along the way and I just can't figure out what. If I convert the letter to outlines
  in Illustrator it gets a lot of points also, like 50 instead of 15 when I drew it.
  The letters look nice in both Illustrator and Studio 5, but they don't look so nice
  after I generate it as a true type/open type.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling this might
  be a silly question for the experienced but I'm at the beginning and I didn't know
  where to turn to.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n"

    if your problem is caused by autohinting when generating the font. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here are three instances of the endings of a letter. The first one is the
    clean one made in Illustrator. The second one is how it looks like after generating
    it as Open Type TT/True Type in Fontographer and the third one is after generating
    it FontLab Studio 5. Also I've tuned off autohinting in Fontographer before generating
    the font.  Anyway, the curves are not smooth, not like the original vector drawing.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for taking a look. I just don't know what to do.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4543.jpg]"

  body: If your tools let you export a CFF-flavoured (or PostScript-flavoured) OpenType
    font, how do things look like inside one? I'm guessing there is a conversion from
    cubic to quadratic splines that is messing things up.

  body: Yes, it is the conversion cubic to quadratic splines. I did not know that
    yesterday but I did more reading. I was in panic yesterday. The shapes look much
    better in OpenType.  Thank you!
