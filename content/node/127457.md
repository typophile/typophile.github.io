  body: "Sorry, but the first sample you posted is entirely hand engraved, not typeset
    (the two initial |P|s aren\u2019t exact matches to one another, which is a dead
    giveaway). I didn\u2019t find a match to any of the type in historical type samples
    or modern digital faces.\r\n\r\nThe second sample is more uniform, but again likely
    hand engraved. Reminds me of Monastic, but not finding a match to it in type specimen
    books from the 19th century:\r\nhttps://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/40737/monastic\r\n\r\nAs
    for modern typefaces that could mimic the look, Griffon (sorry, no swash R) is
    vaguely similar:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/griffon/"
