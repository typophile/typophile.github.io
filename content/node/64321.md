  that I was start a few days ago. I'm trying to make a  modern font using a constant
  proportion on most of cases for get clear white spaces with soft curves for be used
  in posters and graphic performances.\r\n\r\nFor example instead vertical rectangle
  of \"o\" the \"m\" use a similar proportion but an horizontal orientation.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Claramaria_show_lowercases_5835.png]\r\n\r\nHope
  you can drop me litle comment or critique for improve some detail that obviousely
  I can't see.\r\n\r\nRegards & respects..!!"

  body: Yes, hard to tell without seeing the letters a bit bigger, and without a full
    glyph set. I quite like the tone of this. The junctions of the arched letters
    (nmr) are a bit high and the white notch will clot at small sizes, so I'd make
    that more substantial. I think e and o look a bit narrow. I think the crossbars
    on f and t should extend further to the left. And I'm sorry to say the spacing
    is not very good ;) Look forward to seeing how this progresses!

    to see a typeface with very little \r\nthinning at the junctions, but which works
    especially\r\nDave Farey's redesign for ITC.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "<strong>Gary Lonergan:</strong>\r\nHi Gary... Happy New Year!\r\nwow! so
    various gliphs are similar between both fonts, although the \"x\" box on cachet
    is more classical than claramaria.. also one have contrast the other are monolined..
    but wow.. so similar.. lol.. now I feel Sad,  the world is so little.. xD but
    any way I'm still working on it.. so, hope soon drop the complete alphabeth here.\r\nI
    really love the references you mention.. specially cachet font.. :) thanks a lot
    for the info.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Bendy:</strong>\r\nHi Bendy... Happy 2010!\r\nwell..
    I'm still working on some Caps of this, and well, about juction of 'gmnpr' is
    caused that I seeking a high simplicity and non classical display font.. I'm thinking
    at leave without that white notch appear over there for prevent cause that clot
    you mention.. using an almost rectangle regular porpotion.. so, if I down the
    junction brake and lose that look, turning like a traditional font.\r\nAbout wide
    of 'e' & 'o' I'll try to extend a little bit and see what happen. I'll also considere
    to make that modifications on 'f' and 't' may be come a little better, and don't
    worry about spacing.. I even not fix work on it.\r\nThanks a lot to all, very
    useful points..!!\r\n\r\nRegads and hope find us soon mates.. :D\r\nPedro (PeGGO)"

  body: "And Happy 2010 to you too Pedro :)\r\n\r\nIn that case, you could try thinning
    the spurs (e.g. the top left corner of the vertical stroke on r). I think the
    combination of the small notch and the no-thinning junction makes that part quite
    dark.\r\n\r\nYour contrast looks almost reversed. Is that intentional? The horizontals
    are rendering heavier than the verticals, it seems?"
