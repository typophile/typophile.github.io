  I'm up against because of my inexperience.\r\nI have to create a logo in Glypha
  with the word \"Tarbord\". Now, I do not know how to treat the letters and whether
  kerning is something that is usually used in cases like this, or is believed to
  be something wrong because it goes to modify the original values created by the
  designer. Setting the optical kerning seems to me that the result is better than
  setting autokerning but I read that this procedure is not recommended and that it
  is preferable to set the kerning manually. I'm working with a text size of 100 points.
  What values do you think are the best to get a satisfactory result?\r\nThanks a
  lot."

    your eye should be the final judge."

    you think that the space between letters is balanced or would need some adjustment?

  body: "It sometimes helps to look at the word three letters at a time. So looking
    at TAR, doesn't the A look too far away from the R? And with the ORD, Doesn't
    the R look too far from the D? \r\nOf course, with a logo you can alter the letter
    forms too. In this case particularly you could change the length of the serifs,
    which could alter the effects of proximity too."
