  1923 typeface and was talking to Dan Reynolds about it. He asked me if there was
  a constructivist heyday in Greece at the same time as the Russian Avant Garde and
  German Bauhaus.  I told him I didn't think so because it was a troubled time in
  Greece then.  Since I said that, I began to wonder if anyone knew more about it?
  Perhaps Gerry Leonedis, John Hudson or any other student of visual history might
  be more knowledgeable and share their insight?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    What I'd really be interested to know is if there was any sort of dialogue between
    Greece and the West, or between Greece and Soviet Russia at this time.\r\n\r\nMalevich,
    Van Doesberg, El Lizitsky, Jan (here Iwan) Tschichold, Paul Klee, Kurt Schwitters,
    Mondrian, et al. \u2026 these people didn't all have much in common with everyone
    else necessarially, but in hindsight it is easy to put them all in the same \"box,\"
    even if that oversimplifies things. Did they have any \"copiers\" in Greece? Artists
    trying to follow along the same lines?\r\n\r\nWere there Greek Communists/Bolsheviks?
    What did their graphics look like?  Soviet Russia laid heavy on the propaganda
    during the 1920s and 30s. Did any of this make it to Greece?"

    Thanks for adding your wisdom and clarifying my question.\r\nI would be curious
    if it were just a Central and Eastern Europe thing? Eventually Italy ended up
    with its birth of Modernism and the oft blasted Massimo must have learned his
    trade somehow but Greece? xero ego?\r\n\r\n\u03A0\u03BF\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2 \u03BE\u03AD\u03C1\u03B5\u03B9;\r\n\r\nChrisL"
