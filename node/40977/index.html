  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I accidentally posted in the wrong forum last time, but will try again here.  Sorry in advance to anyone who sees this post in the critique section.</p>
<p>How’s it going everybody? I am Graphic Design student studying abroad in Stockholm. I am currently trying to research Swedish typography, but have run into a bit of a road block. I am curious if there is anyone out there who can give me names of great Swedish typographers? I am very interested in the old-style ornamental typography, but would love to hear of any great typographers or typesetters.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any books that document Swedish typography? I read in a past post (was from 2005) that there was a beautiful illustrated book of Swedish typography. Does anyone know the name of this book, or any other books that I might be able to take a look at. For my purposes I am more interested in looking at previous examples rather than a how to book, but would appreciate any response.</p>
<p>Thanks much, and I hope to hear back from you guys soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have definitely tried the google search.  I found a few links, but no matter how far I looked, I couldn&rsquo;t find any  good books or quality images.  I have a few names, but was curious if anyone knew the masters of Swedish Typography.</p>
<p>Anders Bodebeck, Bo Berndal, Franko Luin, Lutz Baar, Lars Berquist, Karl-Erik Forsberg, Waldemar Zachrisson.</p>
<p>I have found all these names, but can only seem to find typefaces for sale by them.   While it is great to see some of the fonts they have designed, I would really like to see some of their work.</p>
<p>Ideally I would like to find a book documenting the history of Swedish typography, but haven&rsquo;t found one.  I also get lost once the websites switch to Swedish.  I have only been here in Stockholm for a few weeks, so I don&rsquo;t speak the language yet.</p>

<p>Welcome to Sweden and Stockholm!</p>
<p>Is it typographic designers or type designers you are seeking information about?</p>
<p>I know a few people who has great knowledge in both matters. Maybe one of them might even answer right here in this thread?</p>

<p>Yeah welcome, nice you found your way to Stockholm. I could give some advise but won&rsquo;t do it all here. Please get my contact info on my web site and give me a call when you have time. Please also contact a wonderful second hand book shop south of Stockholm. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Antikvariat Morris&rdquo; and the owner Glenn is a very nice fellow. Over the years he have specialised in Typography books, specimens etc. <a href="http://www.svaf.se/morris/index_eng.htm">http://www.svaf.se/morris/index_eng.htm</a></p>

<p>Thanks for responding.  While i am interested in learning about both, I am more interested in the artwork created with Swedish typography.  i.e. posters, signs, books, etc.  I really enjoy the ornamental style fonts that I have seen in old Scandanavian artwork.</p>
<p>Learning about the people who actually design different typefaces would also be great, but I am hoping to find examples of Swedish typography used in artwork.</p>
<p>Stefan-</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.  I will check out your website and will get into contact with you in the next few days.  I will also check out &ldquo;Antikvariat Morris&rdquo; and hopefully I will be able to find something.  My only mode of transportation is the tunnelbana or by bus, so I will have to research more about the store, and hopefully find a way down there.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
