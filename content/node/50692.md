body: There are different letter drawing teaching techniques for children such as
  the Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian methods. Some character formations are unique to
  different languages and countries such as the 7 with or without a slash or a q that
  has a curled tail vs. straight.  Are there any good resources for some of these
  basic learning alphabets for young children in languages such as Arabic and Hebrew
  and even Ukrainian & Slovenian where the local preference in teaching character
  formation in learning to write is explained?

  body: i would grab some primers, either for child learners or for students for whom
    these might be second languages. I have some great textbooks for Russian, but
    I'm sure one could find these in a decent sized library for the languages for
    which you are seeking. i tried to look at primers to find regional preferences
    for languages that use Devanagari script and found these to be useful resources
    when i could find them.

  body: Additionally, it may be hard to find certain models for letter drawing techniques.
    When i was learning Russian, we only ever did script writing excercises and were
    never formally taught to write in block letters, i'm guessing this would be similar
    to the experience of most young students learning to write in countries which
    use the cyrillic alphabet. Anything I might say about Arabic would be mostly guess
    work, but I would think that teaching of the relation between initial/medial/final
    forms would be an important aspect in teaching the basics of the script to new
    learners.

  body: Thanks Paul. I was going to ask you directly since this is an extension of
    a project you know well. If anyone knows of any online resources, this quest is
    on behalf of a client. I would be interested to know if anyone has compiled a
    "localized pre-school" alphabet chart?

    presentation at last year\u2019s ATypI</a> about it.\r\nFor my master\u2019s thesis,
    I focussed on Latin script only. However, I do have some copybook samples and
    the like in other scripts aswell, Cyrillic at least.\r\n\r\n<cite>if anyone has
