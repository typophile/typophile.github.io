  body: "suprisingly I can't even find it online. i found this but it's not a very
    good reference.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts101.com/xt_fontdetails_az_FID!32184~CenterCityBold~font.html\r\n\r\nthe
    version i have has bold, bold oblique and regular and regular oblioblique. I'm
    primarily using the bold oblique version. I was sort of thinking about coupling
    it with ITC Conduit or maybe Target or Normetica but not sure. I will need to
    use body copy with it and it has to have a tech science feel."

  body: i can download center city in all truetype but can i convert it to postscript?
    it looks like it came off the typecase 2001 disc which i have no clue how to get
    a hold of.

  body: Thanks. I think I'll stick with City BQ. I am leaning towards coupling it
    with ITC Conduit but the Capital Italic E is driving me nuts. Should I just open
    it up and make an E from the F? That E is really bizarre to me for the typeface.

    Conduit is bizarre indeed, intentionally. I get the feeling you're not ready to
    buy any new fonts, so why don't you let us know what you've got and then we can
    be more helpful in suggesting a City pair. If you <em>are</em> willing to invest
    in some new type, may I suggest <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20DIN\">FF
    DIN</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=diamante\">Diamante</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/eurostile_std_ot_virtual/\">Eurostile</a>
    \ as a tamer alternatives to Conduit."
