body: I am looking for script type or typeface which has a feeling of ZEN. It can
  not be too Asian or too feminine.  I need this typeface for a new Pharmaceutical
  product, mostly used by women. Basicaly I am trying to give a fresh, organic and
  elegant look to the new product. Any suggestions?

    maybe you just mean spontaneous looking? In which case I think Stephen suggestion
    is probably bang-on.\r\n\r\nReally though - as Paul points out; something spontaneously
    made by hand would be the better and more authentic match."

  body: Hehehe, this kind of request always takes me back to the discussion I had
    with [[Nick Cooke]] of [[GType]] fame. As he never intended it to be, Nick was
    quite surprised when I told him there was an uncanny similarity between his delicious
    brush script <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?4Y0">Gizmo</a> and Korean
    cursive calligraphy. If you want to go Zen without being too obviously Asian,
    this is the way to go. ;^)

    on Veer anymore, and FontShop nor MyFonts carry them neither.

  body: Yeah, I know about Type.co.uk, but I thought that vendor was specifically
    aimed to the British market. I don't understand why he disappeared from Veer.
    And although I was aware of it I don't really know Font Factory; what is this
    reseller?

  body: "I think Font Factory is Australian.\r\n\r\nYes Yves, I am aware that my collection
    has disappeared from Veer. I noticed this morning. This is due to some contractual
    awkwardness between Veer and Fontworks UK. I'm not overjoyed about it. Hopefully
    it will be resolved ASAP.\r\n\r\nAs you say Florian, they are available through
    Fontworks UK at Type.co.uk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Thanks you. \r\n\r\nI like Gizmo. But what about script typeface with a fresh
    look (not such as Park Avenue Script and so on)? Typeface, which would be appropriate
    for pharmaceutical products, targeting women and men. \r\n\r\nThank you for your
    help in advance."
