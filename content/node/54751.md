  body: "That Q is typical of Baskervilles. I think ITC New Baskerville looks pretty
    close, based on the Q tail shape, although the tail of your 'a' seems a bit more
    vertical than the sample in the book I'm looking at. There are a lot of Baskervilles,
    and I'm having trouble getting MyFonts to open, or I would search with this sample
    text for a closer match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I should mention that it's been outlined, as the bold weight does not have
    the same tail on the "a"
