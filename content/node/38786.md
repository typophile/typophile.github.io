  ago, and I've been freelancing as a graphic designer ever since.\r\n\r\nBut six
  years down the line, I decided I'd had enough of sitting in my pants with Radio4
  and the cat as company and strove towards a stable environment full of them \"people\"
  things.\r\n\r\nI start tomorrow. (Yay!)\r\n\r\nI am terrified. (Boo!)\r\n\r\nIt's
  like first day of school all over again. I'm thirty-cough and very aware I'm the
  new boy.\r\n\r\nAny advice from you lot as to nerves/first steps/just being in an
  office again would be greatly appreciated. I'm filling a new role which is apparently
  vital and will spend an awful lot of time doing stuff for the development/techy
  lot.\r\n\r\nIt's Sunday night. I've left it awfully late to ask for ideas.\r\n\r\ns

    world\" from the cubicle habitat.  I've regretted giving too much of my personal
    story to new office-mates. You don't want the the office scurge to know you share
    a hobby, or even worse - that you're single!\r\n\r\nI try and point questions
    back at the questioner as much as possible, until you figure out the office politics.
    People love talking about themselves, so it's not too hard.  Then, you can pick
    your own confidants and mentors.\r\n\r\nOh, and please, don't use kitten pictures
    on your desktop. Or drink the last drop of coffee without making new -- I usually
    bring in a pound of my own overpriced-but-yummy gourmet blend on the second or
    third day and put a sticky \"help yourself\" on it.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!\r\nAK\r\n\r\nPS
    Definitely the British version!"

  body: "(at the risk of sounding like a human resources consultant, which I'm not...)\r\n\r\nBe
    open-minded and ask a lot of questions. Find out why things are done the way they
    are before suggesting improvements. (Once you've got the lay of the land, of course,
    use your fresh point of view and the tricks you've picked up as a solo artist
    to help make things more efficient.) Be specific in your communication with tech
    folks -- they're so used to vague information from designers and users that detailed,
    technologically aware feedback will make them your allies for life."
