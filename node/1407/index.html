<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>> What positive point? <br> <br>It depends. <br>Like there's a guy (Canadian) who has the Swastika tatooed all over his body, but he's not anti-Jewish. (I don't use "anti-Semitic" here because Arabs are Semites too. BTW, Hitler <i>was</i> anti-Semitic: he hated Arabs too.) <br> <br>>> "vast jewish conspiracy" <br> <br>I wouldn't call it that. <br>1) It's not that vast. Armin for example hasn't been given "The Talk", apparently - but he's from Mexico. <br>2) "Conspiracy" seems to me to mean there is intent to hurt others. In this case I think there isn't. But the duplicity is still there. As with any form of propaganda. And everybody does it. It's just more offensive when the people doing it are the ones already in power. <br> <br>It's not a matter of respecting a symbol (like you say, they don't deserve any such emotions), it's a matter of respecting your fellow people, and cultures - of not beating them to a pulp when they're already lying unconscious on the ground. "Pressing need"? To salvage the Swastika, not really. To salvage blackletter, a little bit, yes, although nothing like the pressing need to curb the modern-day Nazis - and I don't mean those impotent neo-Nazis, I mean the Axis of Evil: US, Israel, Turkey. That's proof right there that religion isn't the root of the problem, since the three major religions of the world are apparently united against humane living! :-/ <br> <br>So I'm not saying that the Jews should let go of the Swastika while others continue using it against them (as William pointed out - even though the Nazis are gone while Israel is currently messing up the Middle East - so it's different), I'm saying that there has to be less greed -and more honesty- in using it. We don't want another Holocaust, so back off - it's pretty simple. The world doesn't want you dead, they just want to live happy lives themselves - don't be paranoid to point of becoming Hitler yourselves. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>David, Matha doesn't want to answer you question - get over it. If you think a person can't have a rational discussion about the Swastika without having read those books, show us why. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>It's just a question of time, guys. Until there's not a generation of young people for whom blackletter (or the swastika for that matter) has no inherent symbolic meaning (and no bad memories), we won't be able to use it in the same way we use other symbols. It's happening already with blackletter <a href=http://la.flavorpill.net/mailer/issue30/index.html target=_blank>in hip/trendy arenas,</a> it will also happen with the swastika. <br> <br>I haven't read Heller's book either, but maybe, as a historian, the Holocaust is still too present for him. In this case his opinions wouldn't be prejudist, just misinformed ones. It would be a personal issue. <br> <br>ps. I can understand the feeling; growing up in Spain just after the transition from military dictatorship to democracy, the Spanish flag became a symbol for the right wing fascists opposed to the change. I still cannot see the flag of my country and feel proud about it, no matter how joyous the occasion (ie. Real Madrid winning the soccer Champions League) ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I still cannot see the flag of my country and feel proud about it, no matter how joyous the occasion.</i> <br> <br>I know how you feel. The Irish flag has a similar effect on me. Especially when it gets waved around in unexpected contexts. <br> <br>A friend of mine recently went to a U2 concert and apparently someone threw Bono an Irish flag and he sang a whole song to it. Held it in his hands and actually sang to it! And he'd be the first person to condemn Nationalism. There were all sorts of Nationalist flags in the crowd too - Basque and Breton mostly. Fortunately, I went the next day.He sang like shite, but not to a flag. <br> <br>At least there's no chance of seeing an Irish flag at the final of the Champion's League. <br> <br>M. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>as a historian, the Holocaust is still too present for him.</i> <br> <br>I can understand that too. He's far too close to his subject and the result is more of a personal commentary (as plain*clothes suggested earlier) or a <i>cri de coeur</i> than history or criticism. Unfortunately he isn't being totally honest with himself or his readers about that. <br>In fact, Allworth Press are problaby more to blame than Heller himself for disguising a pamphlet as a history book. <br> <br>M</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the Holocaust is still too present for him. <br> <br>Well, the Armenian Genocide is about 30 years older, but it's still totally present for most Armenians (including me), not least because Turkey still denies it, and no reparations have been made - not to mention all our ancestral land that we lost after more than 2500 years of living on it. The reason 5 million out of our 8 million population lives outside our [now-tiny] country is because of the Genocide. Plus Turkey and Azerbaijan have been imposing a trade blockade for many years, with the latter carrying out pogroms of Armenians as well. <br> <br>Why?

<div class=commentbody>William, <br> <br>"Of course, within the context of a Hindu temple (where I believe the symbol is not in a circle and normally 'rotates' other way) it is ancient and not <br>offensive." <br> <br>Good! So we agree. There is nothing "necessarily" offensive about the swastika form. <br> <br>When working with Fleurons the interlocking swastika form is persistent when building suites of Fleurons. "You read the correctly". I suggest there is something organic, chemical and structural about the form itself. I have discussed this at length with a mathematician. <br> <br>My first typographical masterpiece was a "not" so hidden "Swastika form" It was a major artistic development for me. People driving Harley Davidsons did not buy them. Al Segal, a Vancouver rare book collector did. A "Jewish" furniture manufacturer. <br> <br>It did not remind him of the Holocaust! It was not ULT!, VERBOTEN!, and JUDE <br> <br>Now Hrant has reminded you of one atrocity. I remind you of another, the plight of the Palestinians. It is a short study in racism. <br> <br> <br>............................. <br>Hrant, <br> <br>You don't seem happy about some situations in the world. Maybe you are a George Bush fan. I hate to ask you a favour, but I am hindered in some research for an article I am writing. <br> <br>You seem to have ways of getting information. <br> <br>Houston, but most likely Orlando. A company called "Arbusto". "Arbusto" is "bush" or shrub in Spanish. <br> <br>Here is what the question is. <br> <br>Arbusto apparantly was named after George W. "Bush". It is reported that "Arbusto" is/was George Bush's oil company. His partner/shareholder was Salem Bin Laden, "Osmar Bin Ladens" eldest brother. <br> <br>Is there any way you could verify that for me? Keep in mind that Salem may have invested under a corporate name. Perhaps an airport. <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha, <br> <br>You say Heller does not like German Fraktur. Which womb mothered "German Fraktur". Probably this. <br> <br><a href=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/web/pgsdbl560/1_009010_009b001r.html target=_blank>http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/web/pgsdbl560/1_009010_009b001r.html</a> <br> <br>It's not old English. It is German. Medieval, sorry, things are not that finite. <br> <br>.......... <br>German Fraktur type (as opposed to other medieval gothics, such as Old English) still evokes iron-fisted authority. The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!, and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these letterforms. Actually, anything set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous look. <br>....... <br> <br>Maybe Heller finds the Good Book decidedly ominous? <br> <br>I just can't tolerate, intolerance. <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa</div>

<div class=commentbody>> You don't seem happy about some situations in the world. <br> <br>It's more than that - I have a problem with the world's overall direction, <br>possibly since the Elightenment, but at least since the Industrial Revolution. <br> <br>I'm [essentially] agnostic, but these words by Catich about Gill ring so true: <br>"He hit on the basic weakness of western culture and life <br> of the past five centuries. He saw clearly thirty years ago <br> what only a few are dimly realizing now. He spoke out <br> against the disunity (dis-intergration) of man; a state in <br> which man is not only divided from God and neighbor <br> but is divided even within himself." <br> <br>-- <br> <br>In Castillian "bush" is indeed "arbusto", but I don't know of any such connection (although it wouldn't be surprising). Part of the bin Laden clan is actually involved in either Bechtel or Halliburton (I forget which - it doesn't really matter anyway), two firms conveniently making a lot of money off of Iraqi misery at the moment. <br> <br>The degree to which the financial interests of the bin Laden clan are intertwined with those of Big White Business is indeed telling. In fact I don't think it's crazy to at least suspect that bin Laden and/or Saddaam (especially the latter) are on the US payroll. If you'd only seen the strange bedfellows that war makes as I have in Lebanon... <br> <br>Anyway, this is getting too far off-topic. <br>I think we should talk about how to get Heller to back off from defaming blackletter. Maybe a petition? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>Yes, we should stick to the topic. It's so easy to wander. <br><a href=http://www.unknownnews.net/2001-1.html target=_blank>http://www.unknownnews.net/2001-1.html</a> <br> <br>So, fill me in on this Heller theory. Is his complaint that Fraktur is offending "his peoples"? Or, is Heller proposing that Fraktur embodies some mystical evil spirit? Is there dragons in there or something? I better keep my lights on at night. This house if full of Fraktur. Trust me, my wife owns a Finnish used book store. <br> <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_fraktur2.gif target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_fraktur2.gif</a> <br> <br>You know fellows, I just looked at that. I think perhaps the lower case "i" is actually a very underfed one eyed cyclops. I better go get my elephant gun from the closet. Now that I think about it, I used to print wedding invitations in types resembling in some fashion that Fraktur stuff. The marriages didn't seem to last long. Maybe I should have stuck to Caslon Italic. You know they didn't last long with Caslon either. Is Caslon evil too? <br> <br>You know, I think I figured it out, it's not Fraktur, it's this: Column left, heading! <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/Ink.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/Ink.html</a> <br> <br>Cleaned with this. <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/WashUpBottle.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/WashUpBottle.html</a> <br>Left hand column, heading. <br> <br>Off of this. <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/Windmill.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/Windmill.html</a> <br>Self explanatory. <br> <br>After you printed this. <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/GoudyThirty.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/GoudyThirty.html</a> <br> <br>Am I evil because I designed this book? I am going to hell, I know that, but surely not for these reasons. <br> <br>So I am assuming Heller is not a racist. You just know how I feel about racists. So Heller must have explained his superstitions about Fraktur. It will be wasted on me though. I stopped having my palm read in the sixties. Still, I am curious. <br> <br> <br>You know, this is the "black arts". <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br> <br> <br> <br> <br></div>
