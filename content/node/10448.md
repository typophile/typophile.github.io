body: Hi there. I&#39;m reconstructing a logo for a client and can&#39;t seem to match
  up any of the fonts on it with what I have. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70292.jpg"
  alt="original logo design">  <BR> <BR>Would someone be able to check out my attachment
  and give a recommendation? I&#39;m pretty sure the words &#34;LENS&#34; and &#34;GO&#34;
  are the same font. Don&#39;t worry about the number 2, as I&#39;m going to pen-tool
  that one in Illustrator. <BR> <BR>Thank you so much!

  body: Actually, just testing the &#34;GO&#34; and I was wrong, it&#39;s not the
    same font as &#34;LENS&#34;. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: To be more specific about Dav&#39;s ID, the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/antique-olive/18-antique-olive-nord-scal-48009/testdrive.html?s=LENS&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Antique Olive Nord</a> weight gives LENS. <BR> <BR>GO is not the
    same font, because that G is wrong for Antique Olive. It looks more like a heavy
    weight of Helvetica.

  body: Hi Mike, <BR> <BR>Yeah, I just tried Helvetica black and it&#39;s close enough.  <BR>
    <BR>I just gotta nail that 1866 and I&#39;ll stop bugging everyone. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: I think the &#34;1866&#34; is hand drawn. It&#39;s just a couple of circles
    and some straight lines. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a font, because the shapes
    look so awkward. <BR>It might also be some badly drawn freeware font.

  body: You could approximate 1866 with Avant Garde, DIN, Futura, Kabel, Ronda, or
    practically any font from <a href="http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html"
    target="_blank">Mike Yanega&#39;s Bauhaus Guide</a> but I agree with Jan - that
    8 looks like it&#39;s about to fall over, and the kerning is really messed up
    &#40;at least for a logo&#41;. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Awesome. You guys have been great. Kabel and Antique Olive Nord were exactly
    what I needed. It didn&#39;t have to be a 100% recreation. <BR> <BR>Again, thanks
    so much everyone and have a great day!
