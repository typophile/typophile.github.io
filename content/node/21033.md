body: I have been considering doing a face inspired by a stencil face I have seen
  on the wings of Airbus & Boeing aircraft. I did a search on Myfonts.com to see if
  there was anything that matched my intent too closely already & I didn't see anything
  to put me off yet. However, myfonts.com isn't utterly and competely encyclopedic.
  Does anybody have any suggestions about fonts I aught to consider before jumping
  in? Or even any source material they think I should consider? Thanks!

    enough for your project?

    - so thanks! \r\n\r\nStephen, thank you very much! Jacob, you too.\r\n\r\nSo far
    so good. There doesn't seem to be anything quite like it. How pleasing and surprising.
    :-) I'll be looking a bit more - especially if anybody else has suggestions."
