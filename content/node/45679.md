body: "came across this interesting article on an Interaction Design blog tonight.
  The just of it is that good typography leads to better problem solving skills ~
  and even better: ligatures lead to greater happiness.\r\n\r\nNow we typophiles may
  may go, \"But of course.\" But now we have the scientific proof to back up our claims
  :)\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the article is over a year old, so new research
  probably  indicates that ligatures cause cancer or something like that.\r\n\r\nhttp://uiscape.com/2007/03/14/feeling-unhappy-try-ligatures/\r\n\r\n"
