  Both the font in the title and the text at the bottom of the poster.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.libertyhill.org/images/2009_auction/2009/deadwood.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso,
  any suggestions for other fonts one would put under the category of \"Americana\"?
  (not saying the aforementioned font is one, but I would like any help.)\r\n\r\nthanks.

    to see the other type but looks like \"Caslon Antique\"."
