  body: Not me, unfortunately. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not even a budget problem, just a
    timing issue. I have several key work projects that will be at a critical juncture
    around this time, and I can&#39;t be out for a week &#40;which is what it would
    be what with preparing a talk, and travel time&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I think
    David Lemon, Christopher Slye and Harold Grey will be there from Adobe. Christopher
    only has one key-deadline project on his plate, luck guy.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Its a shame these conferences can&#39;t be scheduled at a time between semesters.
    January 17-19 would have been much better. Same problem with Atypi.

  body: 'Jim, I can only speak about my own session, but I will be presuming at least
    passing familiarity with MS VOLT, i.e. what is is for, the basic interface layout,
    etc., all of which I have covered in talks at previous Typotechnica events. The
    session in London will focus on tips and tricks for getting the most out of the
    tool, so I won&#39;t have time to start at the beginning. <BR> <BR>Download information,
    manual and some tutorial material for VOLT is available here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx"
