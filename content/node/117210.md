  in Paris. We detected a great critique about sign painters\u2019 work in general
  in the german book version of \xBBTreasury of Alphabets and Lettering\xAB by Jan
  Tschichold and we want to implement his text into our book.  We are germans so we
  have only access to the german version in our city. Sadly we haven't longer time
  to use the Inter-Library-Loan.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://covers.openlibrary.org/w/id/251445-M.jpg\"></img>\r\n\r\nSo
  I would like to ask you in a friendly way, if someone would be so kind to scan two
  pages for our project?\r\n\r\nThe text is kind of the beginning in the german book
  on page 9 and 10. The german headline is called \u201CSchrift als k\xFCnstlerische
  Aufgabe\u201D which could had been translated in the english book \u201CType as
  artistic duty\u201D.\r\n\r\nThank you very much :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
