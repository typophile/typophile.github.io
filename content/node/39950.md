  a short animation based on typographic letterforms. I have been looking into individual
  letters within a typeface and what characteristics and personality they posses.\r\n\r\nMy
  current results has almost proven that we could represent actual human characters
  within a story by using only one letter from a certain typeface. I feel its another
  way of looking at type perhaps, but a fun way, not only for myself, but for the
  audience, and i could have great fun with the treatment of some letterforms.\r\n\r\nCheck
  it out, and tell me what you think? Does this seem a fun and interesting idea? or
  am i off my head! it just seems like it could work and could be quite quirky!! \r\n\r\nMany
  people have told me they enjoyed it and never really looked at type in that way
  before \r\n\r\n[[http://www.woodymedia.co.uk/uni/crabby/typequestionnaire.htm]]"
