  body: 'Yup any of the above. I know that there is a trend for grunge fonts and there
    are so many to choose from. I wonder what fonts have more class and will be less
    dated? I want that natural earthy appeal but I don''t want it to be to distressed
    and I want the style to be admirable. '

  body: How grungy? Grunge for me is different than what I might think of as crunchy.
    Do you have an example that might lead us down the right path?

  body: "What? No one's going to suggest Papyrus? ;o)\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a bit trendy,
    but I fell in love with the Hatch Show Print wine bottles. Can't say I liked the
    wine much, though. The letterpress feel might fit the 'crunchy' need and reflect
    a bit of the 'organic, old world' feel.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hi Thanks so much forthe help...so much to choose from! There is a wine called
    Overstone which uses it and it's such a nice concept but papyrus was not a good
    choice for the logofont!
