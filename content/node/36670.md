body: I might get the smackdown for this, but I cannot seem to find what font Typophile
  uses for their own logo and nav. Does anyone know this? Alas, I'm in love, and I
  do not know a name (sigh)

    support our sponsors.\r\n\r\nOr do you mean the one that spells TYPOPHILE in the
    Logo (that\u2019s Gotham)."
