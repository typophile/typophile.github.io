body: I&#39;m trying to identify the black serif type in a poster designed by Herbert
  Leupin in 1955.  <BR>It appears he made a collage using a real newspaper from that
  year.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28386.jpg"
  alt="trib"> <BR> <BR>The newspaper &#34;Tribune de Lausanne&#34; ceased publication
  in the early eighties.  <BR>I have found no information as to when the TdL was first
  printed, as a clue to when  <BR>the masthead was designed. <BR>Any suggestions about
  Latin typefaces used in Europe before 1950, as well as  <BR>any leads on digital
  Latins which approximate this face would be appreciated. <BR>Thank you.

    target="_blank">&#34;Saracen&#34;</a> is a digital Latin headline font. <BR> <BR>I
    will look into Jaspert&#39;s &#34;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&#34; to see what
    is shown about 50&#39;s-era Latins, and get back.

  body: Other than Monotype&#39;s Latin Antiques and Latin Condensed; and Blake&#39;s
    Latin Wide, all I found in the Jaspert book was Chisel, an inline version of Latin
    Bold. Judging from that sample, Latin wasn&#39;t a very popular style. <BR> <BR>I
    also found a display Latin metal type called &#34;Primus&#34; in the A.T.A. Type
    Comparison Book, but it is like a wide Black or Ultra weight. &#40;Not the same
    as Berthold Primus type from 1964&#41;. <BR> <BR>Not much help in those places.
    Sorry. <BR> <BR>You can try typing &#39;Latin&#39; at MyFonts and see what they
    show as current choices. <BR> <BR>
