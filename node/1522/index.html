		<div class="commentbody">Hi Addison, <BR> <BR>Great start. This has a good funkiness to it that I think is  <BR>really seen in the <b>a</b>. Here are some things I notice: <BR> <BR><b>n,m,h,u,b,d,p,q,t:</b> Check the stroke modulation. It seems a <BR>little wobbly. Particularly in as the horizontals lead up to  <BR>and transition into the verticals in the branches and bowls.  <BR> <BR><b>t:</b> Crossbar is too short! <BR> <BR><b>g:</b> Check the spacing in the waist. You may need to <BR>open it up a bit to prevent clogging. <BR> <BR><b>w:</b> Looks wide. I think you took two v's and put them  <BR>together. This is fine, but I usually narrow each before  <BR>doing so. It makes the fit better with other characters and  <BR>keeps it from getting too wide. (same goes for an m made  <BR>of and n + an n branch</div>

The x-height and other proportions may default to those of Times creating the &quot;Timesy&quot; look you're talking about. I'll try lengthening the descenders (I'll slap my own wrists for using default settings). <BR> <BR>I wasn't aware of that type of zero in some Didone types, so thanks for the info. Something I had seen made me try that, but I can't recall what it was. <BR> <BR>The irregularity is the result of different readings. Part of it is my fascination with Frederick Goudy's freehand drawing techniques. I've often admired the handcrafted quality of his letters, especially in Kennerley. I also have a Caslon specimen book that claims imperfections are part of what makes Caslon so readable. Then there's Fred Smeijers' <i>Counterpunch</i>. Anyway, it's probably just a phase I'm going through that I will hopefully learn from. <BR> <BR>And Hrant, I understood what you meant by &quot;defaced.&quot; <BR> <BR>I appreciate both of you commenting on my work. <BR> <BR>-Addison</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Addison, <BR> <BR>Looking good, and you haven't lost the funkiness. The proportions look fine to me. You might consider deepening the crotch in the r. Otherwise it will square up at small size. Your 9 looks over rotated counter clockwise by about 5-10 degrees. You'll need to rework the tail to fix the problem. <BR> <BR>If I were you, I'd press on. Whether or not it turns in to coins for you, there is more to learn. What would small caps look like? How about an italic? Try to make a bold weight. The learning will continue. Also, I think everyone gets to a point in any long creative project where you wish you were working on something else. <BR> <BR>If you did decide to shelve this, I'd suggest working on something very regular (anti-funky). It will present new challenges. <BR> <BR>Oops, forgot to mention. The spacing is too tight (IMHO) and the y is indeed causing spacing issues. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Purist? More like pragmatist. Unless a font will never be used conscious of economy (ie with minimal leading) descenders need to be notably shorter than ascenders for reasons of language - you know, that thing people use our fonts to set. Descenders are too rare in actual text to &quot;deserve&quot; as much space as ascenders, even though structurally they in fact need more room to elaborate - this being a serious mismatch between the alphabet and the languages which use it, btw. This is why the &quot;g&quot; in a &quot;real&quot; text font needs to be slightly cramped. <BR> <BR>As for optimal x-heights, the primary determinant (for a text face) is intended point size usage primarily (and things like &quot;taste&quot; only secondarily). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

What is the necessity? It seems to me a better formulation to say that because they are infrequent they can afford to be shorter, and that it makes more sense to shorten the descenders than the ascenders.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Addison. <BR> <BR>This is looking really nice. The italics are super. One suggestion to bring them more into character with your roman set: <BR> <BR>A defining characteristic of the roman is the heavy horizontals found in your branches and bowls (top curve of the h, bottom of the a, top of the m, bottom of the u etc - even looks slightly darker than the verticals). This is part of the funky. You might try that in your italic also. Granted the curves are much more abrupt in the italic, however, try a tad more horizontal emphasis in the tops and bottoms of the strokes. Pleased to hear you will be continuing! <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Couple of comments for you: <BR> <BR>1. Foot serifs on the roman r and f could extend to the right a tad to balance the letters. <BR>2. g appears to be leaning right. try moving the head left a touch to fix. The bicameral g is way too grotesque, consider&hellip; wait, wrong font. <BR>3. The spacing on the italics is loose (agreed) <BR>4. Try the dot of the italic i a hair to the right. Actually, you may want to revise the structure at the top. It looks identical to the n stem. The result is too left leaning at the top. It shows up as a hole when next to round letters (as in the song: old mcdonald had a farm, eieio). To correct follow the italic angle a bit longer before exiting into the pothook. <BR>5. The k seem ok to me, just a little wide. Too much spacing to the right too! <BR>6. The w. Kern baby kern.  <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I think I need some advice on creating italic capitals. I've been referencing Caslon and Janson (mainly Caslon) and it seems that the capitals are slightly more upright than the lowercase &ndash; except in cases of the A, V, and W, which are more angled. Please take a look at page 2 in the PDF below. <BR> <BR>I've modified the italic p (smaller bowl), f (exaggerated the curves a little more), i and j (fixed the top and moved the dot), and t (the top is scalloped and leans more to the right). The lowercase spacing is better, but the capitals are a nightmare. I've restrained myself from kerning anything until the sidebearings are resolved. <BR> <BR>On the roman I extended the the right foot serifs on the r and f and the g doesn't lean anymore. Hrant, can you explain more about the k and the s? I want to make sure I understand what you mean. <BR> <BR>I'm still tweaking, but I've got to let this one go one of these days. I feel the need to take Randy's advice and try something &quot;anti-funky&quot; and more refined. I still want to add small-caps, at least to the roman. Anyway&hellip; <BR> <BR>Let me know what you think, and thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>-Addison <BR> <BR><!--attachment: Specimen_1-13-04-24176.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*31.2*Specimen+with+italics*Specimen+1%2d13%2d04%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Specimen with italics<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Specimen_1-13-04-24176.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Specimen 1-13-04.pdf</b></a> (31.2 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hildebrant, <BR> <BR>Yeah, there is. The ascenders begin to hook back to the left at the top and the descenders hook to the right. It just sort of came out in my doodles. I suppose this was part of my effort to add some variety in the angles&ndash;I had noticed that many italic faces applied varying angles to each character, which harmonized nicely as a whole. Is it bothersome to you? <BR> <BR>For anyone interested, I am still working on this. Spacing has proven to be the most tedious (and not-so-fun) aspect of type design. Small caps are also in the works, but I'll probably post another text sample when I finish the kerning pairs on the roman and italic. <BR> <BR>-Addison</div>
