  the content; it's what they do. There really isn't a milder example...)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TGFD_4678.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's
  not recognized by Identifont or WhatTheFont. I have the impression that it's probably
  an Internet freebie. But they're unlikely to be typophiles -- it's probably a relatively
  widely distributed font.\r\n\r\nNotable characteristics are the canted line endings
  on the uppercase I, E, F, and L; the angled-but-squared-off line endings on A, M,
  and R; and the legs on K and R just touching the verticals.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nGarth\r\n "
