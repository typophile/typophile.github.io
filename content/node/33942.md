body: Hello, I am doing some visual research on security patterns, for example the
  ones on checks, stock certificates, etc., as well as the new Bank of New York logo.
  Does anyone happen to know any other corporate identity based on these kinds of
  patterns? Any leads are much appreciated!

  body: I think that this identity's days are numbered... Or rather, it is about to
    become much less visible... last year <a href="http://gothamist.com/2006/04/09/goodbye_bank_of.php">Bank
    of New York was swallowed by Chase</a>, and I have already seen BNY locations
    sporting the big blue can't-turn-the-corner-without-seeing-one Chase logo...

  body: "What is going on with all the banks these days??? It seems like every time
    a store goes out of business, a bank sprouts up to take its place. I do most of
    my banking online, there is an ATM everywhere you look, who is using all these
    banks? And gawd they add nothing to the neighborhood. I guess it's appropriate,
    tho, in a city only bankers can afford to live in. And like banks, bankers do
    nothing to enhance the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nIn Chase's defense, they were here
    first (and swallowed up Manny Hanny, Chemical, etc back in the 80s). But WaMU?
    Wachovia? What the...?"

    a bank too.
