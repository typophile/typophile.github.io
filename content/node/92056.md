  body: "<blockquote>How is distinguishing learned letter groups from unlearned ones
    anything like reading?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's not what happened. In the learning
    phase, the baboons were exposed to sets of words and non-words, but in the testing
    phase they were exposed to <em>different</em> sets that they had not seen before.
    So what they were demonstrating was the ability to recognise patterns in how letters
    are ordered or not ordered in English words, what the researchers call orthographical
    processing. It doesn't surprise me that this level of orthographical processing
    is independent of language knowledge, because I can easily tell the difference
    between, say, real Russian text and random arrangements of Cyrillic letters, even
    though I can't read the language. But I am surprised -- and delighted -- that
    baboons can do the same sort of thing, especially since they're primates that
    are not even in the hominid line, which means that a shared perceptual functionality
    that makes this possible must have evolved an incredibly long time ago.\r\n\r\nThe
    comments at the end of the article seem misleading, though, or at least poorly
    expressed. 'Recognising the entire word'? If anything, in this regard, the study
    suggests that what is being recognised is patterns derived from letter ordering
    principles. Entire words can't be being recognised because the baboons don't know
    the words. What they are recognising is patterns of letters that correspond to
    learned rules."

    it's a nice bit of proof that recognizing abstract, arbitrary patterns that mean
    something (in this case \"I get food\") requires no formal education, that it's
    strongly related to the brain's \"firmware\".\r\n\r\nIn fact what I find extremely
    interesting is the possibility of seeing what kinds of letterforms (think sans
    versus serif) primates do better at! And I would also test crows.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    examine how Grainger et. al., come to the conclusion that the baboons were \u201Ccomputing
    an orthographic code.\u201D\r\n\r\nUsing results from primate performance, Grainger
    et. al., try to make the case \u201Cthat orthographic processing may, at least
    partly, be constrained by general principles of visual object processing shared
    by monkeys and humans.\u201D I've been arguing for some time, as Grainger et.
    al., do here that the perceptual proccessing dimension, in other words, what happens
    in the visual cortex, is often under-explored by cognitive scientists.\r\n\r\nTo
    make their case that baboons are perhaps computing an <em>orthographic code</em>,
    Grainger et. al., point to analogies in performance statistics between the baboons
    and humans, and cite the work of S. L. Brincat, C. E. Connor, on how  the macaque
    brain synthesizes low-level neural signals for simple shape parts (simple contour
    fragments) into coherent representations of complete objects. The idea of Grainger
    et. al., is that full letters are analogous to these parts.\r\n\r\nAn alternate
    explanation that seems to be a more \u201Cecologically valid\u201D extension of
    the S. L. Brincat, C. E. Connor analysis might be that the baboons learned to
    recognize words from what we might call <em>word-specific trans-glyphic featural
    patterns</em>, rather than as orthographic sequences, that is, rather than \u201Ccoding
    the word and non-word stimuli as a set of letter identities arranged in a particular
    order,\u201D the results might have been based on across-the-word <em>feature-conjunction</em>
    similarities.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Peter, yes, that alternative explanation is possible, as it is for human
    reading. Of course, the baboons are performing a different task than the human
    reader: they're not recognising words as semantic objects, they're only distinguishing
    between patterns of ordering, which is something that the human reader has to
    do too, but only as a sub-task process. In the past, we've posited super-letter
    pattern identification as an efficiency, something that makes it possible for
    us to get to where we really need to be, which is word recognition, faster than
    letterwise recognition. The baboons, it seems to me, don't need that efficiency,
    recognising patterns in letter order is where they need to be to complete the
    task. And I'm not convinced that 'word-specific trans-glyphic featural patterns'
    are more 'ecologically valid' as extensions of Brincat & Connor's findings than,
    say, starting from even lower level, intra-glyph feature recognition, e.g. recognising
    the relationship between stem and bowl in /b/ as constituting a distinct object,
    then distinguishing the order of that object in a sequence such as 'blob' from
    a sequence such as 'lbbo'.\r\n\r\nDo you think there is any way to isolate 'across-the-word
    feature-conjunction' patterns from letter ordering patterns in a way that would
    make it possible to test the functional distinction?"

    first need to compare quantitatively the potential supercapicity benefits (because
    of interfacilitation) that would attach to redundancy when calculated at a letter
    level versus at a role-unit or sub-letter feature level. If these turn out to
    be distinct values, fits to performance variance in Word Superiority Effect tasks
    could be decisive, provided quantification of Word Superiority Effects could be
    made sensitive enough. Because of the limitations of screen refresh rates, actual
    tachistoscopes would need to be used.\r\n\r\nInterfaciliation usually isn't in
    the picture in most models of perceptual processing in words, because channel
    independence at a feature and letter level is widely assumed. Role units, as distinct
    from both features in a strict and primitive sense, and letters, aren't even recognized."

    recognition of sub-letter features in super-letter patterns, bypassing the letter-as-object
    level, yes? This seems reasonable. I wouldn't discount the possibility, though,
    that the baboons make the step of recognising the combinations of features that
    make up letter objects, since it is the latter that are actually being reordered
    in the word objects, i.e. that the baboons could teach themselves letter recognition

  body: Ryan, the notion that we recognise <em>whole</em> word shapes isn't given
    credence by anyone familiar with reading research. The open question is whether
    we recognise words by building up from letters or from combinations of letter
    features across the word. In this forum, I tend to argue the letterwise side,
    mainly because the most interesting and knowledgeable contributors to discussion
    make the case for various kinds of feature arrangement recognition.

  body: "I think \u2018building up\u2019 is a misleading metaphor. The visual cortex
    works on the principles of learned responsiveness and task optimizing channeling.
    It doesn't \u2018rebuild\u2019 the letters inside the brain out of tiny bytes
    supplied by rods and cones. With it's tuning mechanisms and form-resolution capabilities,
    the visual cortex (a many-layered thing) <em>connects</em> us dimensionally to
    the marks on the page in the way that best supports the tasks we need to do with
    these marks. \r\n\r\nI like to say that in humans in the visual cortex, for material
    in the uncrowded foveally centered span, there is responsiveness to role-units,
    their local combinations (to form letters) and their across-the word distribution.
    These configurations of role units in local combinations and word-specific distributions
    are what the brain has 'representations\u2019 for, for familiar words. Responsiveness
    to local combination accounts for the fact that we see words as lettered things,
    but <em>without explicit labeling</em>. As Edmund Burke Huey argued in 1908, there
    is an inhibition of incipient recognitions for letters. \r\n\r\nExplicit labeling
    would be fatal, because it introduces the \u201C[phonological] disambiguation
    overhead\u201D issue, which some learners can get hung up on to the point of developing
    enduring reading difficulties.\r\n\r\n\u2018By-parts\u2019 or letter-wise processing
    imagines a chunking process that tends toward explicit labeling at a letter level,
    as a process where connected role-units are processed in hermetically-sealed slots
    or independant channels with no opportunities for across-the-word interfacilitation
    between role-units while the processing is going on, just (a computationally less
    efficient) interactive activation in hierarchical schemes.\r\n\r\nWhile the human
    visual cortex learns a kind of role-unit-analytic processing in writing and forms
    distributional mappings at this level from repeated exposure during reading acquisition
    (which is largely and properly \u2018phonological awareness\u2019 based), I believe
    baboons stick with a kind of feature-analytic processing such as Frank Smith described,
    that responds to patterns of features properly so-called. Features are things
    like disturbed or undisturbed expressedness, or closure / absence of closure,
    in forms with round or oblong envelopes; aspect or extendedness, when it comes
    to items with lack of curvature. In printed words, configurations of these types
    of features make up distinctive patterns which can become familiar, to the point
    where similarity can be assessed, even by species without humanoid language capabilities."

  body: "John, perhaps fatal is too strong a word.\r\n\r\nMy view is that phonological
    awareness is a necessary and important part of reading literacy. And phonological
    mapping is a strategy we use almost automatically whenever we encounter (are stopped
    by) an unfamiliar word. \r\n\r\nIn reading acquisition we are taught a letter-wise,
    or bi-gram or tri-gram, etc., parsing of the word which sets up, so it seems to
    me, a parallel letter recognition / interactive activation-based processing architecture
    and neural representation.\r\n\r\nRepeated exposure in a typographical spacing
    environment where there is 1) a distinctive narrow phase alignment that avoids
    auto-correlation in the vertical parts of strokes as well as distracting harmonics,
    and 2) rhythmic cohesion in the whites, creates a situation where, with non-word
    letter clusters, short-exposure foveal crowding would normally occur, but also
    \u2014 and because of the potential crowding \u2014 provides, in orthographically
    legal wards, a catalyst for a perceptual learning process that remaps words at
    a more primitive (than orthographic) visual level, the level I'm calling the role-unit
    level. Synaptic interfacilitation replaces interactive activation here.\r\n\r\nWe
    don't in my opinion arrive at effortless immersive reading until this remapping
    occurs.\r\n\r\nSo perfect spacing is beneficial to the development of skilled
    readers. For the rapid, automatic visual word-form resolution of skilled readers,
    though, explicit labelling at a letter level by the visual system, such as is
    encouraged in reading acquisition, can disturb the immersive reading process.\r\n\r\n"
