    found various octagonal fonts in which the e was shaped like a stop sign, but
    not this variation in which the sign is rotated so that the points are at the
    top and bottom. Luc Devroye, who has created an incredible virtual encyclopedia
    of fonts, has a page on octagonal typefaces  http://luc.devroye.org/octagon-index.html
    This one might among those referenced.\r\nDon"
