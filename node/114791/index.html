  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am trying to design a book for a customer.  It's non-fiction, perhaps one or two images, otherwise it's text with maybe two levels of hierarchy.  The body text alternates between quoting from an old religious text and explanatory comments.  Sometimes these alternations stretch over a page or more, sometimes they're only a line or two.

For the body text, the latest proposal was to alternate between normal and italic of the same type and weight, a solution which I found comfortable to read.  Setting the old religious text a little "poem style" (indented, italic, ragged right) and the explanatory comment as just reading text (no indent, normal, justified) I found quite pleasing.

However, the client insists on using a bold weight for the old religious text, mixed with normal weight for the commentary.  I find it more and more difficult to argue why I would avoid a bold face.  My latest comment to the client is this: <em>Bold faces are frowned upon for reading.  Anywhere I look, the sprinkling of bold faces into reading text is labeled as a "type crime" because it "blotches" the page and interrupts the reading comfort.  Go into a bookstore, grab any of the books and you'll find that barely any one scatters bold faces into the flowing text.  If you mix bold and normal text, and hold an open book at a smaller distance you'll see black blobs, the "blotches" scattered across the pages.  This unbalances the text, brings it out of weight (that's why "bold" and "normal" and "light" are referred to as type weights).</em>

In your opinion and experience, how would you handle this situation?  Which arguments are there for and against mixing normal and bold face in reading text?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for your comments so far.  My client's response is usually along the lines that this isn't a usual book but a study book.  I'll take a look at less weighty types, I think it's the visual distinction he's after.  I've asked again what exactly he's trying to achieve...

It's not so much about setting the whole book in bold or normal, it's the mix of both in the same body text.  I'm worried that too much bold/normal on the same page looks blotchy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd say that using italic and Roman in the fashion you describe provides a greater contrast than using bold/regular. Not in terms of typographic colour, of course, but in most other respects. It changes the mood and the voice completely, while boldface just dims the light.

And you are in my opinion right about boldface for extended reading. Contrasting it with a regular weight would work against the intention, making the most important matter less accessible and pleasant to read than the commentary.  

I agree that a modern (in the typographical sense) serif would be your best bet if the client still insists. It was Bodoni who invented boldface (though it wasn't very bold, and I don't think he used it for contrast), the bolds of earlier typefaces are modern inventions. Very rarely do they look good, in my opinion. Bold letters needs simple, clean shapes to work well, if readability is a goal.

Having said that, the emphasis is on a visual distinction between the old religious text and the explanatory commentary. Now that degree of distinction I guess is personal preference, and for the customer a bold seems appropriately strong and distinct.

		<div class="commentbody">In addition to creating a blotchy appearance on the page, bold text has more visual emphasis than regular text within a block of copy. This conveys the impression that the bolded text is <strong>more important</strong> since it seems to speak louder.

Italic text, on the other hand, has the same overall visual color as regular text and <em>simply suggests a distinction</em> without implying anything about relative importance.

Judging only from you post and not having seen the work, I think your client wants you to do something that will not only be visually unattractive but will also convey the wrong meaning.</div>

If it's more like a textbook, perhaps a different approach like putting the religious text in a box, sidebar, different color, on a tinted background, or some other treatment might visually separate it without the use of bold. (The use of color would add to the printing costs but I've seen that technique used many times in study Bibles to separate scripture from commentary.)</div>

For the record: some foundries in France and Germany were quietly producing slanted-Romans before Morison "invented" the idea and convinced WAD and JvK to give it a shot. In fact in the US itself ATF had already been producing some, although in their case that was most likely an "affordance" triggered by their pantograph.

I'm now playing with normal and italic faces, where the religious text (formerly bold) is black, and the commentary (formerly normal) is a hint grayer. It looks rather promising to me... [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bla_5820.jpg]

The "darker for religious text" is not negotiable, the customer insists on using a bold face. (I disagree, but that doesn't matter.)

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Nick:</em> Thank you for that, I agree with going for a minimalist approach. However, as I said my customer is quite insistent on this approach and I'm trying to "control the damage." I'm just glad I could talk them out of Comic Sans (I am not kidding).

In <a href="http://typographica.org/typography-books/the-elements-of-typographic-style-4th-edition/">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>, the author says that it's best to change only one property around between paragraphs (or between headings of different levels). Which I thought is nice. I'm trying to convince my customer to not get too excited with formatting, but it's a hard (impossible) sale.

> Let it go! A better design would be to keep exactly the same setting

What worries me about this approach is that I can't find a readable bold/normal type. In addition, they have to have Pali diacritics, which are hard to find (TeX's Gyre have them). I'm leaning towards semi-bold/normal to avoid too blotchy text color, but that wasn't "strong enough a contrast".</div>

Sometimes a client just doesn't see things your way. It's easy to get upset, but another approach is to be polite, finish the job their way, cash the check, and move on. If they offer you another job in the future say you're "too busy".</div>

It surprises me how difficult it is to find fonts that provide the diacritics I need. And have semi-bold. And are nice and rounded and readable. :)

		<div class="commentbody">The 1978 novel <em>Birdy</em> was a story told by two narrators. In the original hardcover edition, the publisher (Knopf) set the text in Linotype Electra, using Electra Roman for the voice of one narrator and Electra Italic for the other. 
When W.A. Dwiggins designed Electra in 1935, he drew the Italic as a slanted version of the Roman letterforms, not cursive. (This was a radical idea at the time, and Mergenthaler later insisted that Dwiggins draw a conventional Italic, which they released in 1944 as Electra Cursive.) In <em>Birdy</em>, Knopf paired Dwiggins' original Electra Italic with Electra Roman, so that readers could easily spot the difference but wouldn't have to wade through page after page of cursive letterforms. 
If you can find a hardcover edition of <em>Birdy</em> (maybe your local library has one), you could show it to your client to demonstrate that an obliqued Roman might work better than bold as a contrasting text face. (Don't show them the mass-market paperback--that uses a cursive Italic for the second narrator's passages.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I went with [[http://www.tipografies.com/fonts/pona/overview/|Pona]] and the type looks very smooth and balanced as a text type, very happy.

However, sadly, the requirements have now changed and I'm being asked, in addition to bolding the religious text, to indent it left and right by 5 spaces. And again, no budging on the customers side :-(

So basically I would now have text where paragraphs alternate between normal textblock size and weight, and bold weight and indented left and right—columned text and normal block. (In 6 by 9 inches format.) The justification: this is a study book, not a NY Times novel.</div>

You know, many of my customers (I set type) want a lot of things I don't approve of. Really ugly type (What, this is a judgement call?). Fonts with butchered Unicode. Butchered ligatures. Interior designers specifying the text size too small, the specified fonts too thin, margins too small (too many characters per page), you name it.

So I whine a bit. Gotta be an end to that, though. In the end, do you want the job or not?</div>

But I don't.  I do this for fun, and people ask me to help them set their print books and ebooks, so they can publish it.  And yes, they make some money with it.  I don't charge for that, because I get to play around and learn something new.  But when at first people ask me to help them because they don't know how to do this, and then tell me how to do what they asked me to do as a favor, I'm beginning to wonder why I bother.

But you are right, I'm putting an end to this, and to this thread :)  I've told the customer that I disagree with his asks too much, and he's better off finding somebody else to help out.

Over and out.</div>
