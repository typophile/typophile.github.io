    [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/signmaker.php|Signmaker]]...)  that could
    be a custom job. At the moment, the only decent alternative I have are [[http://creativemarket.com/Alterdecofont/13678-Holden|Holden]],

  body: "UPDATE:\r\nIn this post I said that another solution is to try and make the
    lettering based on an existing Roman with somewhat compatible letter-forms.\r\nBut
    none of the candidates i suggested for a base font are really all that close.\r\nOn
    reconsideration, I believe that this would probably be too much work for a recreation
    of the letters and it would be simpler to do the design from scratch.\r\nDon"
