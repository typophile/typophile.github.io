body: Linotype sells a version of Times New Roman. At the bottom of the pdf sample
  pages, it says &#34;Times New Roman is a trademark of Monotype Typography&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>Does this mean that the version Monotype sells, and Linotype sells, is
  exactly the same?

  body: 'Linotype licenses several fonts from Monotype. Monotype could have a newer
    version on their site. I do not know. <BR> <BR>Since the initial distribution
    of Times &#40;New Roman&#41; in the 1930s, there has been collaboration between
    Monotype and Linotype regarding design and distribution. Monotype&#39;s drawing
    office made the original design for the London Times, but most newspapers at the
    time were set by Linotype machines, so a &#40;slightly different ?&#41; version
    had to be produced for those. <BR> <BR>The Linotype versions, called simply Times
    &#40;as opposed to Monotype&#39;s Times New Roman&#41; can be found via the following
