  body: "What \"effect\" are you referring to? There are several connected scripts
    that approximate Vibrolux Reverb but I couldn't find an exact match, quickly.
    Look at this list, especially Brush Script\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=brush+connected+script\r\n\r\nbut
    you'll find others at Veer, Sudtipos, other foundries"
