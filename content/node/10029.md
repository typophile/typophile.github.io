  $300 US to buy from Foundry. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions for anything remotely close
  I could choose instead? <BR> <BR>Any suggestions would be appreciated.

  body: Just for the record, and without judging anyone - I think US$ 300  <BR>is
    a fair price for such a type family. It&#39;s not exactly cheap, but  <BR>neither
    is it overly expensive.

  body: What&#39;s driving up the cost is I&#39;d have to buy the whole family, rather
    than just the particular weight I need for a particular project.  If the fonts
    within the family were individually priced, I assume it would be 25% &#40;or so&#41;
    of the US $300.  Foundry doesn&#39;t really make it that easy to buy their fonts
    though--they have no online shopping cart or anything like that.  They must not
    deal with small designers like me often. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I never meant to imply
    that the font is or isn&#39;t priced fairly.  I simply don&#39;t have the budget
    on this particular project to spend $300 on my typeface. <BR> <BR>I think these
    alternatives are great.

  body: 'Pricing is so tricky - it&#39;s frustrating to have to buy a whole family
    when you only need one weight or style. House Industries makes this particularly
    difficult. On the other hand, you usually get much more value by buying a family.
    I try to consider whether I think it&#39;s a font/family I will get a lot of use
    out of in the future, in which case I don&#39;t mind forking out the extra dough,
    or a one-shot, in which case I usually pass and seek a less expensive alternative,
    or a single weight. Or a font I already have. Kind of the same way I approach
    buying shoes. <BR> <BR>Emigre has the right idea - fonts for sale individually
    and the package available at a discount. '

  body: Seems like a bargain at $15.  Miss Gridnik&#39;s &#34;S&#34; and other design
    elements, but it&#39;s hard to argue this option &#40;and other suggestions&#41;
    would give about 85-90% of the feel of Gridnik for a fraction of the price. <BR>

  body: Usually when I am on the hunt for a new typeface, I am looking for a specific
    weight or something that will fit in a certain space. However, more often than
    not, I&#39;ll license as many weights as I can, or be fine with licensing the
    family, as I will be able to use the other weights later.  <BR> <BR>With House
    Industries, in particular, even though I have had desire to license only one face
    from a family, I&#39;m always thankful that I have the entire family/group to
    use later. I can&#39;t imagine breaking the Ed set up at all. <BR> <BR>As for
    licensing something less expensive. I like to think most of us are saavy enough
    to realize that you get what you pay for. However, in this instance, I think a
    lot of the faces suggested, while less expensive, aren&#39;t necessarily cheaper
    alternatives. <BR> <BR>I agree with you Patricia.
