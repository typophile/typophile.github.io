  Corporate Mark "> <BR>Hey all. I&#39;m in the process of developing an identity
  for a visual communications company. Its decided name is &#39;LI&#39; which is an
  abbr. of Lindborg. I&#39;ve chosen to stick to a typographical sollution for the
  logo, but I&#39;m open for suggestions. Any feedback is welcome. <BR> <BR>Cheers!

    it may have been your full name that made you easy to remember.

    <BR>Greatful for all that info! Cheers! It sure will be &#39;Communications&#39;.
    Just a small mistake. Thanks for pointing it out tho.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tweaked
    it a bit, making the I lowercase. I feels it makes it a bit more playful, and
    hopefully it will make it less corporate, I want to express/communicate &#39;playfulness&#39;
    through the use of typography. Does it work? I feel the letter almost become &#39;figure-like&#39;.
    Does it need balancing? <BR> <BR>S.

  body: You have a point with the .li as an extension of a website hosted in Lithuania,
    or Liechtenstein actually! Don&#39;t know if it is a bad thing really? Is it?
    At what point does a client need to know the rationele behind a corporate mark?
    Do they?  <BR>Even if a spectator makes a connection with, say Liechtenstein,
    would there be any negative connotations affecting the way they see the logo?  <BR>

    1451 Engschrift. Sits nicer I think, also helvetica is just being murdered out
    there with so many vis.com businesses using it.. Suggestions anyone? <BR> <BR>Cheers!

  body: Hi Dana, <BR> <BR>Thanx for that feedback! I&#39;ve now adjusted the dot to
    line up with the &#39;L&#39; horizontal stroke. I also had to add &#39;IT Strategy&#39;
    to the tag-line. Not sure to go for lower or uppercase tho. Suggestions? I&#39;ve
    also introduced a bit of colour! At the moment 100% cyan, but I&#39;m leaning
    more towards a light &#39;corporate&#39; blue. <BR> <BR>At the moment I&#39;m
    most happy with the top, second from the left. You? Or anyone for that matter?

    Why don&#39;t you also say: &amp; We take out the trash. You might do IT Strategy
    but if Visual Communications is the core business drop the &amp; IT Strategy,
    its just an add on. Plus visually the tagline disappears. I see you tried to compensate
    in a couple of versions by spacing out .Li, that doesn&#39;t work for me, it starts
    to fall apart.'

  body: Hey all. Thanx again for all the feedback. In terms of the extended tagline,
    it wasn&#39;t my choice people! However, I will try to talk &#39;them&#39; out
    of it. I also decided to go back to helvetica neue, condensed black. I feel that
    the other faces weren&#39;t quite bold enough against the &#39;chunky&#39; &#39;.LI&#39;.
    Suggestions of a suitable typeface anyone? I&#39;ve now narrowed it down to four
    versions. I&#39;m still having a hard time deciding on outlined or not? Also,
    do you guys have any suggestions on the distance between the baseline of &#39;LI&#39;
    and the tagline? Should it be based on the distance between the elements of &#39;LI&#39;?
    &#40;it currently is&#41; I&#39;m still working on the corporate colours, will
    get back to you on that one... <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>S. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/54342.gif"

  body: As for the distance, scale it down so that it&#39;s about 50 pixels tall.  if
    you can&#39;t read Visual Communications, adjust the size ratio between the logotype
    and the tagline as well as the spacing between the two.  The reason you want to
    do this is because the entire logo usually takes up 50 pixels with about 7 pixels
    white padding around the logo, usually being 65 pixels total on the web.  Of course,
    this depends on the design of the website, but this is very common and you want
    it to be readable at low resolutions as well as very high resolutions &#40;like
    1280 x 1024&#41;.  I think you want to avoid using different ratios for print
    and web.

  body: As you can see, the tagline is not very visible at low resolutions, which
    is not appropriate for websites &#40;see all major corporate websites of all industries
    for verification of this concern&#41;.   <BR> <BR>You also cannot read the tagline
    from far away.  If the tagline is important for the business, which most are,
    it should be somewhat visible.  In many cases for new brands, the tagline is as
    important than the logo/logotype is seeing as people have not made the connection
    that &#34;.LI&#34; symbol means &#34;visual communications&#34;. <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/54486.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Again,
    you still might want to consider why you are using &#34;.li&#34;.  Maybe it&#39;s
    because your client/management says so, but I think it&#39;s a bad idea in a lot
    of ways.  Acronyms and shortforms usually made it harder for people to remember
    the brand.  People will not say &#34;Lee&#34; or &#34;Lie&#34; communications
    when they talk about the brand.  They just won&#39;t know what to call you and
    it&#39;ll be extra hard for people to make the connection with your old name &#40;if
    they know it&#41; and new people will be clueless.  Don&#39;t pick a shortform
    just because IBM and others have one.

  body: Hi Ken, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve taken the reduction issues you mentioned &#40;Cheers!&#41;
    in consideration and when mocking up the website I actually wouldn&#39;t reduce
    it to the extent you did. I found the tagline to be fully visible. This goes for
    the business card and letterhead as well. I will post some photos soon to give
    an idea, and for feedback of course!  <BR> <BR>As for the name, I was to some
    extent given a relatively open brief, with lots of creative freedom, but this
    business will be to some extent be sub branded through another existing IT firm
    lacking the services we will offer, so I

  body: If you make it bigger than 65 pixels, it&#39;ll look huge at 800x600.  This
    is why most sites never cross that pixel barrier. <BR> <BR>I still think you should
    have Lindborg in the name.   I&#39;m basically assuming that &#34;LI&#34; is the
    logo, not the name and that Lindborg should be somewhere. <BR> <BR>I think the
    mark itself is fine.  It gives the impression you want.  But a logo that is memorable
    is nothing if people don&#39;t have something to associate it with, i.e. a name.  There
    are very few brands that rely on the mark alone and it takes billions of dollars
    to make sure people know it.  For an abstract company like yours, you almost have
    to have the name in the logo.  If I started to call my company Upfactor as &#34;UF&#34;
    and used the same logo, that would confuse a lot of people.  It doesn&#39;t make
    a lot of sense since Upfactor is short enough and an identifiable name on its
    own.  In a way, I&#39;d be making the brand worse by cutting it down.  I think
    you&#39;re doing the same thing.
