  body: "There is a font like this called <strong>Wolga_serb</strong> (Copyright \xA9
    1994 by Danny Amor) but I have no idea where and how to acquire it.\r\nYou are
    right it seems like a modified Helvetica and given that fact, I think it's better
    to start with/modify the original Helvetica to avoid any licensing issues."
