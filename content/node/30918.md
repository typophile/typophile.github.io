body: "Fellow Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI was commissioned to design a new logotype for a
  fancy, chique restaurant in The Netherlands. The main design is an RC monogram (for
  Restaurant Claudius), but the client wanted a really detailed design to sandblast
  (is that right?) on the window, and for big prints like the banners they have in
  front of their restaurant.\r\n\r\nCheck the attachments for my design. I'm quite
  pleased with the decorative logo, I'm not too sure about the type treatment though.
  It's set in Perpetua Titling MT.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts and comments?"

- body: I agree with poms - a touch more air would help th elegant feel.  I also agree
    with garden - it looks very good.  I love the ornamental logo; it's just gorgeous.  I
    worry about scaling it down, but I see you have simpler versions that will scale
    endlessly.  Nice work -- and it goes perfect with foie gras and Sauternes.

    like Perpetua then I'd recommend Requiem. It's a gorgeous font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/testdriver/fineroman.html\r\n\r\nMight
    fit more in line with what you're looking for. Great job thus far!\r\n"

  body: "I agree with your concern about how well the Perpetua goes with the logo--which
    is strong. \r\n\r\nHave you tried different weights & italics of the Neutraface
    itself?\r\n\r\nAn interesting alternative with a classic feel is <a href=\"http://vllg.com/Feliciano/Garda/mudTyper+Weights/\">Garda</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also feeling that the black square in the middle of the ornament is too stark
    a transition. A one way to go would be to have an art deco style ornament, instead
    of the neoclassical leaves, so as to match with your nice logo in style.  "

    too, but again the integration of the RC doesn't fit. You're mixing retro (the
    RC) with classic, which could work, but IMO isn't just yet.\r\n\r\nPlease don't

  body: "Fernando, that's not a lowercase 'U', it's a cap 'U' with a stem, which has
    been part of the Perpetua typeface for over 80 years. I actually prefer stemmed
    'U's, since no other letter (save 'Z' maybe) has such wonky contrast as an unstemmed
    'U' (to my eyes anyway).\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    typeface, I think Garda No. 2 or No. 3 will look extremely good with the monogram,
    because of the small serifs in 2 or the 'sans serifness' of 3."

    possibly post some photos of it implemented?"

    body: "The project is pretty much complete, the logo is anyway. The client was
      happy with Perpetua, and wouldn't fork over the $150 for Garda. Right now I'm
      working on the menus, business cards and stationary, and I'm in talks with a
      sandblaster to see what can be done with the front window.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've
      been having meetings with a silversmith to produce custom cutlery and an embroidery
      factory to get custom napkins.\r\n\r\nAnother factory I'm talking to creates
      wine glasses, coffee cups, dinner plates, side plates, champagne flutes et cetera.
      They'll be creating all the restaurant's dishes.\r\n\r\nAll of this should be
      finished somewhere in mid to late April, I'll be posting photos then."

  body: "Looking at the dates this project is probably long ago finished, but I want
    to add a technical note.:\r\n\r\nFor safety reasons I would suggest against sandblasting
    directly into exterior window glass, as it will weaken the glass and make it more
    prone to breakage. This method is better suited to small decorative pieces set
    in frames, or as part of a soldered glass arrangement as with stained glass. You
    can hang such framed pieces inside behind the exterior windows, and mount them
    in other locations as room dividers and such.\r\n\r\nIf it must go directly on
    an exterior window, there are vinyl products that simulate the sandblasted effect
    quite well, barring close tactile inspection."
