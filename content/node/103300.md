  body: "I love Mandel's work. He balanced art and technique so superbly.\r\n\r\nI
    have his \"Du pouvoir de l'\xE9criture\", and I do recommend it (if you read French)
    but there's little technical stuff in there - it's mostly cultural. As Sevag says,
    Richard Southall's book is a better bet; he worked with Mandel on his most significant
    \"lo-fi\" type (Colorado) and the last chapter is a highly detailed account of
    that project.\r\n\r\nBTW Mandel's successor of sorts in the realm of phone book
    type is Piero De Macchi, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at ATypI-Rome in 2002.
    His Nomina is pretty amazing.\r\n\r\nMaxim, I didn't know about that article -
    what a keeper!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    used to know Stanislas. I met him and many other <em>Compagnons de Lure</em> in
    1997, at their annual get-together in Lure-en-Provence. Ladislas was a sweet man,
    and a great design professional. Now his Cyrillics is another story in its entirety\u2026 "
