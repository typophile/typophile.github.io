I've worked through various concepts with different graphic elements but I feel a simple sophisticated approach just using type is best suited. The implementation to the web and print collateral will clearly communicate "slick travel company".

This lettering was worked up from a sketch so be gentle with the critique of the letterforms, spacing and kerning. 

I very open to constructive criticism.

There is a small version below and a larger one attached.

@ jayyy — I noticed that too and was initially bothered by that. After continuing doing logo roughs I noticed that unless there is a very obvious graphic device that says "travel company" the name will always invoke that lawyer/accountant aesthetic. I suppose a lot of the descriptive elements about the nature of the company will be communicated through the implementation. By <em>slick</em> I mean minimal graphic styling with careful consideration of the chosen copy, stock and finished techniques with a strong emphasis on high quality (descriptive) photography. 

Perhaps I should include a tagline at this stage to help?

It has an air of history to it too, which is nice. Though I'm thinking if it was coming from an older logo ... they would have used some globe graphic ... or something, or even just wings spread ... or something. 

go the exclusive mile high club (interesting campaign)

Great stuff.

Perhaps you have to look to better colors here to get the right feel.
But in my opinion that is just reparing something. I would go for an other graphic.

Second if you use this ligature for the R, I would make a bridge to the second name. It now washes away. It feels lost. (desert Island ... mmmm ... travel) ...

I see some irregularities in the type.
To me the D and S - for instance - look havier than the L, W

Aside from this, I like to see you took another approach to this.

Hopes this helps

		<div class="commentbody">@ Ratbaggy — Thanks for the feedback. I think I might look at a globe graphic and maybe explore that avenue a bit more. Cheers

@bobbybobo — As mentioned above the name itself does carry a stigma of law-firm, etc so I'm not that worried about that at the moment. I will take your advice on colour and post up some colour variations soon.

The swash <em>r</em> at the beginning had a countering swash coming from the stroke on the <em>d</em> which I took out because I felt it wasn't working. Below is a sample of it.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_1_3631.png]


I will take your point on the weight irregularities (this was my main reason for posting here) as I am fairly new to designing type I couldn't quite pick out what it was. I work with two other colleagues on identity work, we each present our own unique ideas to the client and this was my idea. The two others use graphic elements so I thought I'd try using solely type.

I understand you need fullcolor for this, but simular can be done with two colors.

I've done a similar version except inverted. With the background being the image and the logo just white. Your version seems to give less attention to the letterforms and makes them look better (or maybe it's just that they're against white).

I was also trying to vary the type from the original. Below is a very rough inline version which I liked. I haven't modified it so some of the inline widths vary but you get the idea.

		<div class="commentbody">@Ray — I get your point on loosing character without the swash and I am quite fond of it. 

@Scott — At this stage I'm really trying to refine the type for the logo and not too worried about the colour. Implementing the logo using photography, colour, taglines, etc will run the point home that it's a travel company.

		<div class="commentbody">Here's a thought about using the swash on the ampersand. If you go that route, you might be able to create a complementary shortened version of the logo that just says "E&W". I just tried it myself, and the distinctive swash really holds the logo together when the E and W are kerned more tightly to the ampersand. 

That being said, I do also like the elongated R on the original version. It made me immediately think of the logo for [[http://www.underconsideration.com/|UnderConsideration]].

This is my first post here, but I hope these are some of the kinds of criticisms you were looking for.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@ Wesley — Thanks for your comments I have taken you point on the kerning between certain characters, however, I have done several versions using combined letterforms to no avail. Joining the ‘W’ and ‘Y’ creates unusual emphasis on that character combination which is not something I want to point out. Due the the quite chunky serifs the space where the letters join looks crowded and I would have to counter that by tracking the rest of the letters closer together which I feel is going in the wrong direction. 

@schrockwell — I have looked at the shortened version before and felt that the company is relatively new and shortening the name will further mask the actual name of the company. It's not something I'm ruling out though. Using this version the swash on the ampersand also creates unusual prominence to the ‘W’ while alienating the ‘E’. In general, as a rule, I'm trying not to kern everything close together. As substantial as the letters are, I want to keep a lightness to them also.

As always appreciate the comments. Thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with others that the inline version is best.

Have you tried something like this: extend the swash on the ampersand a bit lower so that you can curve it back on itself; then loop it back to merge with a swashed R. Make sense? I think that could really help tie it all up. Then again, it might make for an obscenely long swash on the R...still perhaps worth a shot, though. If the lines thin out at in the middle of the swash ligature, that could help...

Nice work otherwise.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just a quick update. Simple type without swashes is what I have decided to go with because I want to implement the logo with graphic frames. Below is just one example.

Bear in mind I'm keeping it flexible so that it can be used with or without the frame.

Let me know what you think?</div>
