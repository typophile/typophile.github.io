body: Any idea why a font ends up at the very end of InDesign&#39;s font menu? <BR>
  <BR>After Z in the menu there is a rule and then the font I&#39;m working on is
  listing below that line. Anyone know why?

  body: InDesign thinks its primary codepage isn&#39;t the same as the other fonts
    in the menu. <BR> <BR>What language groups does the font support? <BR>What format
    is the font? What OS are you on? What version of InDesign? <BR>How are you activating
    the font? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: It&#39;s a basic latin font, OpenType, WindowsXP Pro, Indesign CS, activated
    via Suitcase. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve cleared the AdobeFnt files and have rebooted,
    font still showing up at bottom of list.

  body: Hmmm. You&#39;re using FontLab to build this? Check which codepages you have
    declared support for in the Font Info dialog. Maybe you have some more codepages
    declared than you ought.... <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks for the input Thomas. Still haven&#39;t sorted this out. I am using
    FontLab. Regarding your last note and checking to see that no other codepages
    are active, do you mean in the Encoding &amp; Unicode section of the Font Info
    dialogue?  <BR> <BR>In Supported Codepages and Default Character Set I have only
    1252 Latin 1 in the list, and in the Supported Unicode Ranges I have only Basic
    Latin selected. Does this sound right? <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your input...

    body: "Hi Thomas, greetings from the past.\r\n\r\nHello Jason, you don't know
      me but I was rooting around trying to find an answer to a problem I'm having
      with a font, and I found you had the same problem back in 2005.\r\n\r\nDid you
      guys ever find an answer, and if so, can you pass on some advice?\r\n\r\nThe
      current OT font I'm working on is in a group at the very bottom of the font
      list in Adobe apps, along with 3 others: Ex Ponto Pro, Krungthep, Silom. I'm
      using FontLab 5.0.2 Mac, and InDesignCS, IllustratorCS, PhotoshopCS (all on
      Mac). FontLab automatically gives me these 4 codepages for my font: 1252, 1250,
      1254, 1257. Maybe codepages 1254 & 1257 can go, but I think both 1252 & 1250
      need to be there. I have tried removing one at a time till all that is left
      1252, but my font is still always showing up at the bottom of the InDesign list.\r\n\r\nHow'd
      you solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLinnea\r\n"
