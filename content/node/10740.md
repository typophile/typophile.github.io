  <BR> <BR>Similar to verdana, but it cant be because its used in a litestep theme,
  and everything is in caps.. Litestep doesnt have the option to make everything caps..
  please help. <BR> <BR>PS. Image isnt the greatest, i have more but all are same
  quality.'

  body: Hmm... I just did some layovers in Photoshop, and Tahoma Bold 7px fits almost
    perfectly over this sample. Verdana bold is too large at 7px and too small at
    6px.
