  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The most peculiar thing happened to me this past May.</p>
<p>I was reading Brad Land&rsquo;s <cite>Goat: a memoir</cite>, an autobiographical entry about Mr. Land&rsquo;s experience with the Kappa Alpha fraternity at Clemson University. Interesting and engaging. Unique style of writing as well.</p>
<p>But what was the most interesting part of the book was when after I turned the final page, to my surprise I found a page that discussed and explained the choice of type! The choice was Sabon, and it was a tiny little paragraph explaining  the type, as well the reason it was used.  For the highly curious: I have the book. I can scan in the spread if you desire.</p>
<p>Can anyone here fathom why this was done? I&rsquo;d actually like to see it more often, as I found it interesting, and a great way to expose the layperson to type. But it&rsquo;s the first—and only time—I&rsquo;ve seen such attention given to the choice of typeface.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Often the use of colophons in 20th-century American books is credited to book and type designer William Addison Dwiggins (WAD). Among large American publishers, the house of Alfred Knopf has most frequently included colophons in their books, with info about the type, the name of the book designer, and the name of the printing company.</p>
<p>But if you want to see some colophons, go to a library that has a good collection of American &ldquo;fine printing&rdquo; of the 60s, 70s, 80s. Colophons in these books often ramble on, telling who made the paper, who designed and cut and cast the type, who set the type, what press the book was printed on, when the press was made, what the weather was like, when the cat died. On and on. &amp; I&rsquo;m not joking about the cat; I cannot recall book or publisher, but the colophon told about the cat&rsquo;s passing. Some are like short stories. Some are pretentious as hell. Some have useful info.</p>
<hr>
<p>In our era, when everyone has or &ldquo;knows about&rdquo; &ldquo;fonts,&rdquo; more people are taking notice at least of typeface mention in colophons.</p>
<p>At this press, we put colophons in most of our books. This helps our freelance designers get their names out into the world, and thus get more jobs. I can attest that happens. It also allows, us when appropriate, to note anything special about the paper we use.</p>
<p>Many people think colophons are pretentious, glorifying matters no one cares about. I feel they help acknowledge good work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Camera-ready copy for this book was created entirely with POSTSCRIPT and printed on a Linotron 101 at Adobe Systems Incorporated.

<p>I see colophons that list such things as &ldquo;A Garamond&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dante MT.&rdquo; We here at Typophile may well know what &ldquo;A&rdquo; means in this context, and what &ldquo;MT&rdquo; means. But the general reader does not, and will likely not go to the trouble to dig up that info. These sort of attributions give readers both too much info and not enough info, all at the same time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me add to my earlier post: in our colophons we give the typeface name and almost always the name of the typeface designer. I think it has helped draw some attention to new types (which we try diligently to use).</p>

<p>Here is a curious example by Selva Hernández and José Luis Lugo. The LM is because the book talks about Leopoldo Méndez, one of the finest Mexican engravers of twentieth century.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A colophon that is quite informational about a font and that also feels personal is the one in  Lawson&rsquo;s book (copyright 1990):</p>
<p><strong>Anatomy of a Typeface</strong> was set in Galliard, a typeface designed by Matthew Carter and introduced in 1978 by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. Based on the types created by Robert Granjon in the sixteenth century, Galliard is the first of its genre to be designed exclusively for phototypesetting. A type of solid weight, it possesses an authentic sparkle that is lacking from current Garamonds. The italic is particularly felicitous and reaches back to the feeling of the chancery style, from which Claude Garamond&rsquo;s italic departed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if what follows is to be considered part of the colophon or not (set in italics).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>several things:</p>
<p>Colophons in Latin America may be a legacy of Spanish colonial laws that required the printer be named in all printed books. This was not to give credit where credit was due, but was one more way for authorities to try to keep track of who was writing what. I&rsquo;m not sure how long these laws were in place in which countries, but I&rsquo;m fairly sure of the origin. maybe some of our friends in Latin America can help us.</p>
<p>Bimbo Monotone was featured in a colophon written by the one-and-only Alastair Johnston of Poltroon Press in Berkeley. I do not know the book in which it appeared. I have it taped to te back of office door. In the cool months I see it every day as I hang up my jacket in the morning and again as I leave at night. It is a good reminder to take very little seriously.</p>
<p>Knopf still puts a colophon in most of its books.</p>

<p>That particular colophon described the picture on the cover (an engraving of a ball of snakes in a mating frenzy), including a lot of biological details that would appeal more to a herpetologist than an computer scientist. It then listed the production editor, copy editor, proofreader, quality control staff, index writer, cover designer, cover design software, and cover typeface. It then went on to list the interior designer, text font, heading font, and code font; then the illustration artists and the software they used. Finally it named the author of the colophon itself.</p>
<p>About all they seemed to leave out was the blood types and shoe sizes of the people involved. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I love the Colophon! At the publisher I used to work for, we didn&rsquo;t do a formal colophon but we always credited the designer, typesetter (if separate), editor, production editor, and production manager. We also listed the fonts but that was a practical consideration. Often the book was reprinted many years later and it was a useful reference for what font(s) had been used.</p>
<p>I have never noticed a license that requires the designer to list the font, that seems like chutzpah to me. OTOH I don&rsquo;t read most licenses to the letter (sorry Tiff!).</p>

<p>IMHO, these clauses are rather wishful thinking. I wouldn’t take them too serious.

<p>That means that <strong>if</strong> there is a colophon <strong>then</strong> you should not forget to mention their font in it. That makes sense. There is no requirement that there be a colophon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colophon&rdquo; derives from the Greek, meaning &ldquo;finishing touch.&rdquo; So it typically refers to a statement at the very end of a book which gives information about its production.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Note about the Type&rdquo; was a typical heading used by A. A. Knopf, which was/is probably the most prominent publisher to regularly include a colophon in trade editions (as opposed to fine print editions, where the practice is practically <em>de rigueur</em>). Even so, Knopf would usually include information about the design, composition, printing, and binding in the statement also.</p>
<p>Knopf has continued to include Type Notes, but pretty much dropped the crediting of other aspects of production in the colophon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the Author&rdquo; statements are usually considered distinct from a colophon, even though they often appear in a similar position at the end of a book. But sometimes the two types of statements are combined.</p>

<p>From the original Electra specimen:</p>

<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>This pamphlet is the announcement of a new Linotype face to be called “Electra,” cut from designs drawn for The Mergenthaler Linotype Company by W. A. Dwiggins. The face — at this stage completed in twelve point, roman and italic — provides a new type texture for book-page composition. In the larger sizes now in preparation it will furnish the printer with a new note in advertising typography. 
     The face, as may be seen from this specimen, falls within the “modern” family of type styles, but is drawn to avoid the extreme contrast between “thick” and “thin” elements that marks most “modern” faces. The design is not based upon any traditional model, and is not an attempt to revive or to reconstruct any historic type. What the letter-draughtsman aimed to do is indirectly developed in the following:</p>

<p>Here is my only attempt at devising a colophon, which appeared at the end of Multimedia Language Teaching, Logos international (1996).
I edited and typeset the book as well. Self-glorification, perhaps, but many people commented on it and had never seen a colophon before.</p>
<p>I used Columbus, a font just released by Monotype, at the time still producing high quality fonts, but ultimately doomed to perish in the digital era. Once a great foundry; now just a faint memory for  most people.</p>
<p>My use of the font had a purposeful connection with the book, as I explain in the colophon.
Oh, and the little ship is one of the very elegant ornaments included with the typeface.
