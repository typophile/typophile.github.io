body: Well, I hope this question is not too basic for this forum... <BR> <BR>Let me
  give you some background. I am a Computer Science student, but have been working
  with designers for years, thus acquiring a fair share of awareness for good typography
  and design &#40;I love working with designers, by the way -- the company I work
  for has a nice working environment and it is nice to collaborate with people that
  are experts in a different trade&#41;. At least I&#39;m more aware than the average
  CS nerd, I guess <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0>. <BR> <BR>What I am trying to do is to find a collection of typefaces
  that I can use for all my personal type-related needs. E.g. <BR> <BR>- Letters and
  invoices &#40;for the occasional consulting gig&#41; <BR>- Articles &#40;typeset
  with LaTeX. Did I mention I&#39;m a nerd?&#41; or even my upcoming diploma thesis
  <BR>- Headings on my web sites <BR>- Printed music &#40;that is, lyrics and chords&#41;
  <BR> <BR>You could say that I am trying to establish a CI for myself. So how does
  one go about searching the myriad of haystacks of fonts out there? And how do I
  come up with a collection of typefaces that actually look good used together? <BR>
  <BR>I guess I also should mention I&#39;m not necessarily looking for freebies here.
  While I&#39;m on a student budget, I am a firm believer of &#34;a worker is worth
  his wages&#34;. I enjoy being paid for my &#40;non-GNU&#41; programming work,  and
  I have a distinct feeling typographers feel the same way <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>. I am ready to pay a reasonable price for good fonts. So
  I hope you will not perceive this as a plea to get free fonts. <BR> <BR>Thanks in
  advance for your help!

    <BR>I&#39;m a CalStateNorthrigde SECS &#40;School of Engineering and Computer
    Science - cool, huh? :-&#41; grad myself. <BR> <BR>Generally you&#39;d choose
    two typefaces, one for body and one for headings/titling. If you want a really
    austere look you would choose one typeface that&#39;s a large family with both
    text and display cuts. <BR> <BR>The thing is, you seem to have a lot planned for
    your CI, in terms of subject matter. The only way to accomodate all the things
    you list is to go for neutrality, and to me that&#39;s a lousy basis for a CI.
    As much as we think programming is an art as high as music, the general perception
    does not agree, and a good CI needs to be obliging to its audience, not a primadonna.
    <BR> <BR>So I think you should either have groups of fonts you use, or possibly
    find a font with multiple &#34;persona&#34; of which there aren&#39;t many &#40;the
    recent Siemens face is one, but that&#39;s not commercially available&#41;. I&#39;m
    talking the display component here: for the text component it might make sense
    to play it [relatively] safe and choose something like Adobe&#39;s Warnock &#40;which
    does have different cuts, btw&#41; for all the &#34;groups&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Hrant, thanks for the feedback and sorry for the late reply. I can&#39;t
    say much about designers being prettier, since most designers I work with are
    guys. Don&#39;t underestimate the gals in CS, though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>. However, you are right in saying that music and CS are
    not so easy to combine sometimes. I am still working on it myself <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>. <BR> <BR>I am fine with combining different typefaces
    -- in fact, I believe I won&#39;t be able to meet all my needs with just one typeface,
    and I am definitely not going for austerity. Artistic or expressive would be more
    like it, I guess.  <BR> <BR>In the meantime, it occurred to me that I will probably
    need even different body typefaces: Lyrics are usually set sans serifs &#40;am
    I right?&#41;, while I&#39;d use a Serif typeface for a report. Currently, I am
    using the Sigler Jazzfont &#40;<a href="http://www.jazzfont.com" target="_blank">http://www.jazzfont.com</a>&#41;
    to set music, which is nice for the music and the chords, but too &#34;over the
    top&#34; for lyrics and directions for anything but Big-Band charts &#40;IMHO&#41;.
    On the other hand, a plain Sans Serif like Arial looks kinda weird combined with
    it. Is there something that might go well with it? <BR> <BR>By the way, if anyone
    wants to recommend their own fonts, feel free to do so!'
