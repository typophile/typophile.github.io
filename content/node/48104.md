  Where do you look? Coit Tower? Wells Fargo? Trolleys? Street names stamped into
  cement? \r\n\r\nWhat attempts have been made to capture the face of San Francisco?
  Perhaps this was Susan Kare's dilemma in designing <a href=\"http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4\">San
  Francisco</a> that shipped on the early Mac. How else to capture the Mission, Presidio,
  Downtown, North Beach, the Castro?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm not aware of one. Unlike New York, San Francisco is not quite as type-heavy
    a town.\r\n\r\nI do commonly associate <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/w_a_dwiggins/\"
    title=\"W. A. Dwiggins | Designer | FontShop\">W. A. Dwiggins</a>' faces Metro
    and Electra with SF, as they were both used as headline type for the <em>San Francisco
    Chronicle</em> (albeit with adjustments to the letter forms to suit newsprint).\r\n\r\nMore
    common in usage, though, is SF's history of being erected in the Gold-rush Victorian
    era, so it naturally gets associated with tuscan (\"western\") type, and all the
    gaudiness that implies. For instance, the 49ers logo set in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/quentin/\"
    title=\"Quentin\u2122 font family : MyFonts\">Quentin</a>."

  body: "This is a very good question worthy of further research. While Tuscan decorative
    types like Quentin certainly reflect an aspect of the city's history, it is far
    from anything current. \r\n\r\nI would have to agree with the call on Metro being
    a likely candidate, but again I think it only captures a part of the city's story.
    Perhaps there is some need for a new typeface, an amalgam of the best of San Francisco's
    signage much like how Gotham was inspired by the city of New York."
