  body: Helvetica Neue 97 (Black Condensed) is pretty darn close. Whatever is it,
    the E has definately been modified. If that is the case, then there is a good
    chance that some of the other characters have been modified as well. The D's look
    a little tweaked to me. There are so many different versions of Helvetica its
    often hard to tell which is which. Hope that helps.

  body: "Pretty darn close it's not.\r\n\r\nIndeed, at first sight, the M, A and N
    remind of Helvetica and the D and E could pass off as modified versions of the
    Helvetica originals.\r\n\r\nA closer comparison of the M, A and N reveals, though,
    that they're not from Helvetica. As far as one can judge from the low quality
    sample on the pack shot, in Helvetica, the M is narrower, the stems of the A broaden
    more towards the baseline and the modulation (line width variance) is more distinct
    in each of the five characters.\r\n\r\nThat was enough to make me suspicious,
    so I went to the EA Sports site and looked at another pack shot and, well, there's
    not much more Helvetica in the EA font than Comic Sans in the Coca Cola logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/not_helvetica_5061.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Undeniably,
    there is a certain degree of kinship between these fonts in terms of overall anatomy
    and the EA font might have been designed with Helvetica as a template.)\r\n\r\njpg"

    for graphics posted in the thread, as opposed to a hyperlink?

  body: "Preferably jpg, gif (or png) file format, not wider than 600 pixels (http://typophile.com/readme).\r\n\r\nImage
    linking makes sense for big pics (that would not fit the comfortable line length
    of the text messages) and pics of bandwidth-critical file size (I don't know if
    there's a file size limit for the \"Insert Image\" function of this board).\r\n\r\nFor
    all other pictures (and most of the graphics that are typically posted on a type
    forum fall in this category) it's more convenient to actually have the pics <em>in</em>
    the discussion thread.\r\n\r\nStoring pictures outside of this board saves the
    visitor no bandwidth, as there's rarely a point in reading a discussion that deals
    with the pictures posted by someone without <em>seeing</em> these pictures, so
    the visitor will click the links anyway.\r\n\r\nPS: This thread is a request for
    a type face identification and, as such, would belong into the ID forum."

  body: "I'm pretty much 100% sure this is custom made for EA Games. And I'm also
    think I know who's behind this. My friend Rodrigo Cavazos have been working with
    custom type for them. Therefor I doubt it can be bought as a commercial typeface,
    at least for a couple of years which sometimes is that case. hey they wanna be
    unique for a while! There is a slight resemblence wiith SOPHISTO... see for yourself\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com"
