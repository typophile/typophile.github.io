  body: "Found a match to your font.\r\nFontcraft/Scriptorium sells a version as \"Rousseau\"
    in its Nouveau Gothic Package [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NouveauGothicPkgScriptorium_4641.gif]\r\nhttp://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/masterfonts/
    \r\n---start quote---\r\nOur first Master Fonts package features three type styles
    based on late 19th century designs which were influenced by Gothic calligraphy
    filtered through the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau movements. Kelmscott is based
    on William Morris' classic Troy type design. Joyeuse is based on an English font
    of the same period which was clearly influenced by Morris. Rousseau is derived
    from a slightly later French design which shows many of the same influences.\r\n---end
    quote---\r\nRousseau is probably not the original name of the font, a heavier
    version of which would seem to be the original source of the lettering on your
    Columbia record titling.\r\nNote that Rousseau is a lighter version of the letters
    than the ones in the Columbia record titling.\r\nDon"

  body: "Solved more of the puzzle.\r\nThe original name of the font seems to be Kloster-Gotisch
    and it is German rather than French. I believe that Scriptorium called it \"Rousseau\"
    because this name appears in the type specimen, as published by Ludwig Petzendorfer
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/KlosterGotisch2SM_6124.jpg] The specimen is
    for the \"magere\" or lighter weight. \r\nI believe that your lettering is from
    the \"fette\" or bold weight of Kloster-Gotisch or from an extremely similar font.\r\nDon\r\n"

    earlier!\r\nthe kloster gotisch seems promissing; couldn't find a 'fette' version
    to copy from though - will have to tweak a photo of a cover thus!\r\n\r\ncheers
