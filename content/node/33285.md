body: "Due to popular demand the Helveeta shirt is now in production! Co-designed
  with Brian Jaramillo, this garment speaks for itself - mostly because nobody else
  will speak for it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveetaShirt1_3660.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  price for a shirt is 24 Swiss Francs. For reasons of convenience you may assume
  this converts to exactly US$20 irrespective of currency market activity. Shipping
  (for one shirt) within the incontinental US is US$5. For reasons of international
  relations shipping to Switzerland is currently not available. If you'd like a shirt
  please email me with your payment preference, size (of shirt), and ground address:
  hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com\r\n\r\nImportant Note: the current order is for 25 shirts,
  8 of which are already spoken for. Whatever doesn't sell by Friday will be offered
  for sale to the ravenous crowds at the LA screening of the Helvetica movie. If you
  decide to wait for a second batch of shirts, you are likely to be waiting for godot.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "'HRMPH' is in the spirit of the shirt. It's the noise of frustration. Sort
    of like 'bah humbug' but more monosylabic. It used to be used in comics. I think
    I first saw it in 'Peanuts'. Related would be MRRPH. Which is the same thing but
    with less vehemence and perhaps more disapointment. Sense?\r\n\r\nActually those
    letters look kinda good together with the M in the center anchoring it. Maybe
    I should start a fashion label for the frustrated and appaled."

  body: I also liked it because it related to the sentiment of the shirt. And because
    HRANT & HRUMPH both have HR. Anyway it won't make it onto the shirt so no worries.
