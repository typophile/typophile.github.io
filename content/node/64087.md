    With the right inks, the right stock, and multiple hits of white it can work out
    pretty well, especially if the stock isn\u2019t black or something close to black.
    You just need to work with a printer who\u2019s actually interested in tough jobs
    and be willing to pay extra for the effort."

    it.\r\n\r\nHow do you know it's white on blue, and not blue on white?"

    Not very many do letterpress anymore but once you find one it's nothing overly
    complicated. As James pointed out it will most likely require a second bump of
    color to accomplish the necessary ink coverage and it comes at a cost.\r\n\r\nI

  body: Based on the photo I'd be really surprised if these were hot stamped. I worked
    at a commercial printer and hot stamping was done with a metallic foil and I doubt
    it could hold any of the fine detail shown in the 'KIYA BABZANI' sample.

    paper choice! (from the paper supplier, not printer, so they prob. wouldn't know
    how precisely it was done anyways)

  body: "Hi, and thanks so much for the link!\r\n\r\nIt's SlowPrint, like slow food
    ;-)\r\n\r\nYes, in fact I've just been doing some work with an excellent silver
    ink. The metallic content (probably aluminum) is far more opaque than any pigment
    ink, including opaque white. I expect that adding white to the silver would produce
    an effect like the cards shown above.\r\n\r\nThese are definitely letterpress
    with ink on blue stock. While hot-stamping with foil or film (any Pantone color,
    in fact) is absolutely opaque (and can be holographic as well!) it's also really
    plastic looking, at least IMHO. Hot stamping with gold-leaf has a very honorable
    history, of course, but that's really a different ballpark altogether.\r\n\r\nI'll
    try to get some of my trials up on our flickr page in the next few days...\r\nmeanwhile,
    there's plenty there to browse through!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/pfraterdeus/sets/\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\npeter\r\n\r\nslowprint

  body: "Of course, Mr. Hrant is perfectly correct.\r\nDue to the geometrically increasing
    mass of each square mm of paper, the gravitrons of the stock affect the Heidelberg
    Windmill press in the w-y dimension, causing time dilation and a subtle but noticeable
    warping of space. The primary problem has to do with shortening of serifs as the
    press approaches Warp One.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have developed certain techniques
    to help overcome this.\r\nSan serifs are nonetheless subject to the poorly understood
    ghost serif problem.\r\n\r\nThe most successful types used, of course, are those
    which have stood the test of time-and-space, typically those which evolved through
    natural hand-eye-brain interaction, rather than those typically ugly letters created
    at the drawing board or computer which have nothing whatsoever to do with the
    human experience of touch or love. Much the same as mid-20th C Architecture...\r\n\r\nPF\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://slowprint.com/

    was talking about the cylinder press (which AFAIK is the most common letterprinting
    mechanism today), and I assume you agree with the obvious observation that the
    bigger the piece the fewer you can fit on a given size paper. Most of the time
    printing (unless it's a small run) is taken up with \"rolling\"* so that has a
    huge impact on the number of pieces you output per time period.\r\n\r\n* Is there
