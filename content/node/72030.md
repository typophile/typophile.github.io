  Trilogy.\r\n\r\nHas anyone used these extensively?\r\n\r\nHow versatile are they?\r\n\r\nI
  am considering fonts for a school print publication project. I am looking for a
  font family (or pairing of sans/serif/display) that is somewhat unique and contemporary,
  but still practical for a wide range of purposes. My subject matter is popular music,
  although I'm not going to be pandering to fads."

  body: "Thanks. Ya, I saw that post. I won't have any tabular data. \r\n\r\nI guess
    the main reason why I ask about this family is that it doesn't seem very popular.\r\n\r\nYet
    it is a big full family with a contemporary feel. Seems like it should be more
    popular, no?\r\n\r\nAnd so I'm wondering why people don't use it much."
