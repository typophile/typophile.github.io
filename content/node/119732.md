  and type design. Actually I'm about to design my first typeface. I have a rough
  idea. But I'm stuck at making decision on the character set that I want to cover.
  What character set should I cover? I'm pretty confident I want to cover all (ALL)
  Latin scripts. Nothing non-latin for starters. And no specials such as phonetics
  etc. But I would like say SmallCaps etc. I'm just confused. Can someone tell me
  how to go about it? How to choose which character ranges I need to include?\r\n\r\n(I
  have FontLab Studio 5.1.2 on Mac)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for help! "

    caps are a different matter. They aren't included in any character set; they are
    alternate glyphs for the regular letters."

  body: "Very helpful. Thanks. I have one more question though. Do I have to explicitly
    include the 0000\u2013001F and the 0080\u2013009F control characters? And what
    to put in them design-wise, or leave them empty?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Leave the control characters alone. If you've double-clicked a cell in those
    ranges and given it a blank glyph, delete it again.

  body: "One thing you didn't mention in your original post is what type of design
    you are doing. If it is a display font, Small Caps may not be appropriate whereas
    with a text face, they likely would be. Having said that, it is not an ironclad
    rule because some display faces would merit having Small Caps.\r\n\r\nExamine
    current designs done by others that are similar and use those as a starting point."

  body: "I figured it's wise to follow some standard, especially that it's my first
    typeface. After consideration I decided to go with Adobe Latin 4. I'm working
    on a rather decorative display type. I've been thinking and you're right, I will
    actually skip the small caps for this typeface. Also no weight or width variants,
    it wouldn't suit this typeface. \r\n\r\nIf I may, I have one more question. How
    to approach the combing characters, there are some in the Latin 4 set. What do
    they do? Is this some kind of automatic combining of say diacritics with base
    glyph, or one can do so manually when using the font? I don't understand the purpose,
    what combining characters are and do.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

  body: A combining mark has zero advance width, and its glyph outline is set to the
    left of the start. This makes it appear over the previous character when it is
    typed. Try to position it for the width of an ideal average lowercase character;
    the results will often be inexact.

  body: "Awesome, it's clear now. How about the Spacing modifier letters? Do these
    also have some special usage/function or these are just ordinary glyphs? The term
    Spacing modifier letters confuses me, I don't understand it (I'm not a native
    English speaker, so maybe that's why :-).\r\n\r\nMany thanks!"
