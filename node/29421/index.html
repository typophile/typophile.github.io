  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey Typophiles,

So I'm currently revising and updating my portfolio. In the process, I noticed that my personal wordmark, which I designed in school (7 or 8 years ago), looks slightly discontinuous, most likely as a result of the mixed thicks and thins:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cg_old_6718.gif]


Anyway, I've set out to tweak it slightly, make it more harmonious and improve the overall aesthetic quality while bringing it a little more in line with the rest of my identity. I've swapped out the Gill Sans "g" and replaced it with a Meta Bold one. I've made some adjustments to the very top of the "g" so as to allow it to blend into the "c" more smoothly:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cg_new_3731.gif]


And, for good measure, the two paired side by side:

Thoughts and suggestions of all sorts would be appreciated.</div>

Seeing it with the supporting text might change my mind.

		<div class="commentbody">Agree
I would take a close look into Gill's attributes. If you are using the semi circle as a "C" then you might look at the ending angles. On your current "C" of  the gill sans ends up on a vertical ( 90 degrees angle) and the bottom one at a different one.

Also take a look at Gill Sans "@" and compare the stroke weight. 
I agree that the ear of the "g" is too long. Play with it so that the "g" is still centered. You might want to shorten the "C" on top a tad resize it but keep the stroke weight and the original ending angles or if you modify them, keep both at the same angle.

Show us the accompanied text!

Hope this helps.
Thanks

I'll try and get some new versions up later tonight.</div>

Ok! Here's a slimmer C-shape (I somehow don't think I was using a Gill Sans C after all. Oh those strange days of being an undergrad!), with the Gill Sans G. I've taken the suggestions to heart and tried to ensure the top terminal of the C-shape is closer in appearance to the bottom.

And, as requested, with accompanying text, which is simply my full name and whose treatment also dates back to my school days:

		<div class="commentbody">I like the the angles of the new "C" looks sharper. Although Gill "C" endings are cut vertically why not try one like that so it has more resemblance of the typeface?. If you really want to try Meta how about a lighter version? the bold one just makes it horsey and claustrophobic. And I wouldn't mix two sans serif, specially meta and gill. Use what ever is on your icon. Otherwise I'd keep Gill

		<div class="commentbody">I'd hate to ruffle any feathers here, but I like the meta direction much more. However, I do agree even with this version that the terminal angles are not working well together. Maybe try one of the following things:

1. Alter the upper terminal to relate to the lower terminal.

OR

2. Pull the bottom C terminal up to be even with the g's, then slice it flat (even with the g's). Use the resulting implied frame (produced from the C's upper and lower 90 degree terminals) to begin your logotype.

Either approach requires more refinement than is stated, but it's a start.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again for all the suggestions. The terminal question is definitely something I'm going to resolve before I finalize this logo.

I'm using Meta for my other personal collateral – resume, portfolio, business cards, etc. I think at this point, I'm going to look at refining the current Gill G logo. I'm thinking I may be able to set my name in a lighter weight of Meta, or perhaps the caps, and manage to sneak by for now.

More soon.</div>
