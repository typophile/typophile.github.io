  set in Rome.  I would like to create more of these as they relate to the current
  game while keeping the font uniform with the old style seen here.  These were created
  on an older computer that I no longer have access to and I don't have the font on
  my current machine.  Alas, I also can't seem to find it with the various font finding
  tools online.  \r\n\r\nI appreciate any input that can be offered.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Session
