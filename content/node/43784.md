body: "\r\n\r\nA woman who is prohibited from coming within 500 feet and 12pt of Robert
  Slimbach was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of stalking after police picked her up
  near the designer's Malibu home, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\_\r\nSheriff's
  spokesman Officer Steve Finn said deputies were called to the 14000 block of Malibu
  Road at about 7 a.m. by a cabbie who said a fare was refusing to pay for her ride
  into the area. Slimbach himself then flagged the officers down and said he recognized
  the woman in the taxi as the one whom he accused of showing \"unusual interest\"
  in his designs.\_\r\nHe said he did not think she had set foot on his type that
  day.\_\r\nA rep for Slimbach hasn't yet commented on the incident.\_\r\n"

  body: You should have written this about a real designer. Everybody with a whit
    of sense knows that nobody could design those fonts that fast and that Robert
    Slimbach is just a marketing gimmick perpetuated with decades of clever PR work.

      work in Palo Alto and live in Malibu? Nobody could take that kind of commute!"
