  body: There seems to be a real &#39;thing&#39; going on for type with underlining
    swashes.  <BR> <BR>I think usually the swashes are not part of the fonts that
    are used. They are drawn and added on. <BR> <BR>However, there are three fonts
    I know that have swashes included. You still need to use a graphics application
    like Illustrator to adjust the swashes, but we had a post about this recently
    and we <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42935.html" target="_blank">provided
    links</a> for three fonts we know.
