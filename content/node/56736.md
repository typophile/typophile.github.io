  Artists Guild members? I'm preparing to leave my day job in the next few months
  and go solo full time, and I'm wondering what your experience with GAG has been.
  The handbook has been very insightful. And, despite the terribly outdated design
  (perhaps it's done with irony?), their website is full of good info and the \"why
  join\" type of areas look appealing. \r\n\r\nWhy am I hesitant?"

    Perhaps you could get contact info from one or more of those portfolios, and ask
    the designers/illustrators/artists.\r\n\r\nI own the latest edition of their <em>Pricing
    and Ethical Guidelines</em> book... The only negative thing I've ever heard about
    that is that some of their rates are higher than real-world rates."
