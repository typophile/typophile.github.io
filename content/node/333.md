body: If you haven&#39;t noticed it by now, let me send some of your stickiness to
  <a href="http://typophile.com/books" target="_blank"> The Typophile Library</a>.  My
  Question pertains to the categories. I&#39;m having a bit of quandary over the naming
  of them.  For instance, &#34;Multimedia Design&#34;, when I say multimedia I think
  television, radio, internet. But, I found today as I was posting that some books
  only cover internet. And then I realized that perhaps the lot of you, with opinions
  waiting to be voiced, might share some with me. <BR> <BR>And, while I&#39;m mentioning
  categories. If you see any major gaffs as far as the books going in the right sections...
  well, point those out to me as well. <i>But let&#39;s do that by email -- <a href="mailto:wardle@typophile.com">wardle@typophile.com</a></i>.

  body: I agree, Interactive media is a good distinction, but I think it could be
    a subset of multimedia. Of course, then print would be too. Just put Interactive
    in its own category, and have another for, motion design. A horrible name for
    broadcast and film work, but at least one we all understand.  <BR> <BR>Tiffany,
    do you buy all those books, or just put the ones you see up here. Cuz if you buy
    them all, I&#39;m impressed

  body: Thanks for the input so far. <BR> <BR>John -- Let&#39;s just say, and I believe
    it is safe to say, I still own at least 70% of the books listed so far.

    me more than jealous. By the way, thanks for lending them to us. It was a real
    help. It was also a curse, because i have the bug now. '

  body: We have a lot of books represented there, now all we need more reviews! Surely
    with all of the typing going on in the forums, a few articulate sentences here
    and there could be massaged into shape for a book review or two.
