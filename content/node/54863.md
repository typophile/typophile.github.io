  all about the letter H. All the images in the composition begin with the letter
  H. I enjoy the fact that the piece is an actual collage but can also be seen as
  a planned out composition. I think that while the H's in the composition are very
  randomly placed, their position in the piece create a good amount of balance and
  almost a type of texture within the piece as a whole. "
