  generate. Can someone tell me why, when I generate my font, I cannot see the smaller
  outlines to my font? Also, I might need to pay a company/person to help me generate
  this font. Can anyone tell me of a company in the L.A. area that can do this for
  me? Or a freelance Typographer?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nErin"

  body: Well, I have a very script font, like Alejandro Paul's caligraphy- where I
    have a smaller point size for my ornate lines..and when I bring them over I can't
    see them. I can only see the main body of my character....

  body: sounds like you're copying them over from illustrator and the thin lines of
    your designs are strokes.  Expand everything in illustator before copying it across.

  body: Do you mean that when you're using your generated font in an application the
    ascenders or descenders are cut off when viewing a few lines of text?

  body: just a thought... do the outlines have closed paths?

  body: Hi everyone, and thank you for all of your responses. No, the ascenders and
    descenders do show, but the script, ornate outlines do not, just the main body
    of my characters show. I do not know if the outlines have closed paths, could
    that be the problem? I will outline before I transfer from Illustrator to Fontlab
    and see what results I get. Thank you again!
