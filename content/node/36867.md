    font face is this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mideast_3576.jpg]\r\nI
    need to find out only the font face of the \"MidEast.ru\". I don't need that text
    bellow.\r\nI know I saw that font face somewhere, long time ago, but I can't remember.
    Eh.\r\n\r\nAny idea?"

  body: Yeah, but I still think this is OK if I'll always ask here for some font ID.
    I think also, it would be OK for other users too coz they can find more things
    in the same place. What do you think?

  body: "No, Jozef.\r\nYou see, every thread has its unique title, and this one is
    called \u2018Restaurant signs font ID\u2019. So, it won\u2019t fit all the following
    ones, though they all might be requests made by you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the
    person who manages to identify a sample is credited; his/her name will be added
    to the title by a moderator. This way, everybody else can see that this request
    has been solved. \r\n\r\nYou might read the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq\">FAQ</a>
    aswell.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep track of all the requests you\u2019ve posted,
    you can use the \u2018track\u2019 feature (go to your account, via the sidebar)."

  body: "Nope, I would really appreciate it if you start a new thread for each new
    type identification request. Your \"MidEast.ru\" logo has absolutely nothing to
    do with the \"Restaurant signs font\" which identifies this thread. So our people
    won't know there's another identification request here.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, once
    your sample is identified an (x) marks the thread as being solved. From then on
    most of us will stop checking it, and any new identification requests are very
    likely to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nSo, start a new thread/topic/whatever you wanna
    call it for any new identification request. Thanks."

    topic for everything. Mostly coz of that (x) mark.\r\nNot a problem for me.\r\nAnd
    I know about that \"Track\" feature, Florian. That's how I came here in my old
    topic and I just raise a new question here :)\r\nBut as you see I got the answer
    very quickly. Which means people are reading everything what is new. Eventhough
    there is a X mark...\r\nBut as I said, in the future I'll start a new topic always
    :)\r\n\r\nBest regards to everyone. And thanks!"
