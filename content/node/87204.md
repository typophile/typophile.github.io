  patent application? It's close to Franklin Gothic, Titling Gothic, and Alternate
  Gothic, but the exaggerated handle on the 'g' and the tail on the 'a' are hard to
  match.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance..\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dominicmondavi.com/other/patent_typeface.jpg\">Link

    may not be any direct modern equivalent. So close may have to do. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/news_gothic_condensed/|News
    Gothic Condensed]] isn\u2019t a bad match overall."

  body: "Actually, this is an exact match for the Gothic No. 7 that appears on p.
    318 of De Vinne's \"Plain Printing Types\". The ATF gothics (from which New Gothic
    Condensed derives) are cleaned up versions of this. I know of no digital font
    that authentically captures the character of the original, including the much
    greater stroke contrast and various bits.\r\n\r\nI can't easily find an image

    gotta dig up a copy of that somewhere (?!) and figure out if it's worth doing
    an entire menu in scanned letters. \r\n\r\nHmmm...... Or.\r\n\r\nI'd love to get
    my hands on the original metal type and talk the ol' client into getting a small
    letterpress and do the entire menu in moveable type each night, but that might
    be going overboard. \r\n\r\nOne can always dream though..."
