  the question is relevant again.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m doing e-book layout for a series
  the author is reissuing after rights reversion. Is it inappropriate for me to copy
  design decisions made by the first-edition typographer, like chapter-heading fonts
  and section-break fleurons? (With credit, of course; something like, \u201CTypeset
  by Joel C. Salomon; original layout by Sam Designer\u201D.) The first-edition designer
  was hired by the (now-defunct) publisher, not the author, if that matters?\r\n\r\nHow
  say you?"

    the first designer.

    body: "This is terrible advice. I lurk these forums, but this comment (and the
      implications of the original post) are startling and no one else has spoken
      up. The original designer was paid by the publisher to do a layout for a specific
      edition of a book, not the book that you are being paid to layout. Only the
      rights for the content of the book are reverting back the author\u2014not the
      rights for anything else (cover, interior layout, etc). Likely, the author never
      owned the rights for any of that. You are being paid to layout this ebook, not
      the previous designer. Is it ethical to copy someone else's work? No, of course
      not. If you had to ask you probably knew this instinctively. Is it ethical to
      copy someone else's work, get paid for it, and give a credit to the person you
      copied even though they haven't been consulted or compensated? "

    body: 'Could you elaborate on why you don''t think it''s clear-cut? If someone
      is due credit aren''t they are due compensation? The OP is asking about rote
      copying. This is not a conversation about homage, influence, reference, or revival
      (all very different conversations). The question posed was "Is it appropriate
      to copy someone''s work?". Legally, no problem. No one will care. It''s such
      a small project that even if someone did care it wouldn''t be worth pursuing.
      But ethically? Do your own work. Have respect for the work your peers have done
      and don''t copy it. '

    giving credit goes a long way towards "compensation".

    body: "This isn't about being \"inspired\" by something\u2014the OP is asking
      about the rote copying of an existing design. As I've already said: \"this is
      not a conversation about homage, influence, reference, or revival (all very
      different conversations)\". In my opinion, giving someone credit for something
      you stole from them is insulting. Would it be okay for me to make a rote copy
      one of your works as long as I gave you credit somewhere for compensation? Of
      course not. Can I copy a book design someone already did as long as I give them
      credit? Of course not. This is a needlessly reductive line of questioning, but
      I fail to see how you can make an argument for copying another designer's work.
      To belabor this point: the OP asked (in a post tagged \"ethics\") is it inappropriate
      to copy someone's work? He is not asking about being inspired by or taking influence
      or inspiration from. The OP did not read the text and come to similar conclusions
      as the other designer. The OP has only used the words \"copy\" and \"replicate\"
      not \"inspiration\", \"influence\", or any other word that might come with a
      modicum of ambiguity. The words we choose are important. It is not ethical to
      copy someone's work regardless of credit given. "

    work, and then went out of business. That makes a difference to me, ethically.
