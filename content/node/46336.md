  is a toy for generating \u201Cword clouds\u201D from text that you provide. The
  clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source
  text. You can tweak your clouds with different fonts, layouts, and color schemes.
  The images you create with Wordle are yours to use however you like. You can print
  them out, or save them to the Wordle gallery to share with your friends.</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\n"
