  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey everyone. I don&#39;t like to hijack the Gen. Disc, board with personal topics, but I&#39;m not sure how else &#40;or where else&#41; to get this advice on sorting out this Typophile problem I&#39;ve got. <BR> <BR>I did the membership thing &#40;sign-up, PayPal, etc.&#41; for an Uppercase membership, and it all went through &#40;from what I can tell on my receipt&#41;. I did this on January 8th. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s now over 20 days and an email to both Joe and Jared &#40;as recommended by Troubleman&#41; later, and I still don&#39;t have access to the Uppercase area, or any response from Joe or Jared. <BR> <BR>Has anyone else had this experience? Am I too impatient? Is there something special I should do to make this work? I&#39;ve signed in and out multiple times, to no avail. I&#39;m still a typophile without UC access. I don&#39;t mind waiting, but the page says 4-5 business days for the account upgrade/ activation, and I&#39;m not getting any response as to why it hasn&#39;t happened yet. <BR> <BR>Any help would be greatly appreciated! I really like and enjoy Typophile, but I feel jilted. <BR> <BR>&#40;Thanks for tolerating my public plea.&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hmmm.  interesting.  I&#39;m not sure why there&#39;s a need to antagonize people who pay $40 for membership by demeaning them with &#34;we&#39;re not Target expecting .....&#34; but it does say Access is given in 4 - 5 business days.  I&#39;ve also contributed $40 and have not received a single response from three emails.   The money from Paypal was snapped up like a clerk at the counter without an eyeblink.  What are the procedures for a Return.  I think I&#39;d like my money back.  What seemed a warm hearted contribution has turned to ice.  I&#39;m inclined to agree with Eric Pitcock.  Please refund my $40 to Paypal.</div>

For all I know, one of them is trapped in the Himalayas after a plane crash, and the other is hiking up to get them and that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t gotten to it yet. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ll suggest here that they give themselves a longer window for activation and upgrading if they have difficulty delivering on their promise.
