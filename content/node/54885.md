  e for my collages and I made two instead of a big one because my sketchbook is on
  the smallish side and I wanted to separate the text and image. I wanted my letters
  to look like a ransom note or serial killer's wall, and I think I achieved this
  surprisingly well. The images were a little more difficult so I had to get creative
  finding objects that start with my letter. "
