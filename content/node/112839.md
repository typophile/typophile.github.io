  body: "It must be <strong>DSBroadBrush</strong> by Dubina Nikolay [D-Studio, 1999]\r\nMore
    on D-Studio fonts:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-26598.html\r\n\r\nThere is
    also a font which matches (at least ) the latin subset which is named <strong>ft18</strong>
    by FT Content Provider.\r\nMore on FT Content Provider:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-42785.html\r\n\r\nChances
    are that <strong>DSBroadBrush</strong> is the original and <strong>ft18</strong>
    is a non legitimate clone, so please take care on using/licensing.\r\n"

    piece of software called \"Find my Font\" which does exactly that:\r\nIt recognizes
    the fonts used in a bitmap image.\r\nYou can find more details and download a
