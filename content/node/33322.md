  made a Multiple Master font(1 axis) to make a weight family.\r\nEach master needed
  to have a differense positioning value (ex. valt or palt),\r\nbut I didn't know
  how to input positioning value to each master.\r\nHow do I input these values to
  each master?\r\nEven if I can input these values into it, how can I get medium positioning
  value of two masters?\r\nI want to get these values automatically just like the
  kerning values.\r\nDoes anyone know the clue?\r\n\r\nBest regards."
