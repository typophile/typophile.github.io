    a command for Break Link to Style. This will divorce the active paragraph(s) from
    any paragraph stylesheets. \r\n\r\nAlternately, the pulldown menu in the Control
    bar gives you direct access to the [No Paragraph Style] \u201Cstyle.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere
    are similar commands with the Character Styles and Object Styles palettes for
    character and object stylesheets (or you can just apply [None]).\r\n\r\nIs that
    what you\u2019re looking for?"

    appear to be anyway to unset them.\r\n\r\nSo, say you have a paragraph style in
    which you've set a font size of 14 pt., and you want to apply that style to a
    bunch of paragraphs of varying font sizes, but you've decided that you really
    don't want \"14 pt.\" to be a part of the style after all."

    me. What you <em>can</em> do is create a new paragraph style and not explicitly
    set (new) values for these parameters. They then will automatically be inherited
    from the style it is based on. If there is no designated base style, the values
    of the default [Basic Paragraph] style will be used.\r\n\r\nFor Patrick\u2019s
    problem: You can use the option <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/InDesign/6.0/WS60910FA3-2BD7-449d-9904-05CFA551665Da.html#WS15F28658-9D80-4fca-AB52-754957BDD2C4a\">Reset
    To Base</a> (in the style options). It will reset <em>all</em> parameters to those
    specified in the base style. You can\u2019t reset the parameters one by one."

    whole point of paragraph styles is to apply absolutely identical styles (including
    point size) to multiple paragraphs. Any variances need to be applied as manual
    overrides or via character style sheets.\r\n\r\nIf you want to vary point sizes
    in different paragraphs but keep them otherwise identical, one solution would
    be to create one base style and then create other \"based on\" styles that only
    vary in point size.\r\n"

    Sometimes I've needed to work on an InDesign document created by someone else,
    and it'll have 27 different paragraph styles, most with unhelpful names like \"paragraph
    style 12\", and the styles are applied inconsistently. Drives me crazy!"

  body: It's not the copying that's the problem, it's the pasting. Use "Paste Without
    Formatting" in InDesign, or first paste the text in a program that <em>definitely</em>
    doesn't support formatting (Notepad, for example), then copy it out of that again.
