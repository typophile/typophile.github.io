body: "I am the first stages of a logo design for a Dutch company which goes under
  the name Provokatief. As you might guess, this means provocative. In Dutch this
  is normally spelled with a c, but the client feels that using a k is provocative
  in itself. I tend to agree.\r\n\r\nThe company sells trainings for high-end managers,
  and it's methods are rather unorthodox. In the briefing we concluded a masculine,
  corporate logo was a good choice, but to do this with a twist. This seems a good
  choice for the market this company reaches; which also dictates that the logo should
  not be very illustrative or ornate, rather simple and direct.\r\n\r\nIn the attached
  file you find four options. Bear in mind these are sketches; although I worked them
  out in illustrator, they are far from refined. These four are my favorites among
  the thirty or so ideas I have our second meeting about. I have used magenta as a
  second color, which is slightly provocative in this market, but of course this choice
  is arbitrary in this stage of the development. \r\n\r\nI would like your feedback
  on these four. My problem is to find a right balance between the corporate feel
  and the provocative twist. Too corporate doesn't make the company stand out, too
  provocative alienates the corporate market it still has to reach.\r\n\r\nAlso typographical
  feedback is welcome - I've used Univers, Futura and Eurostile here, but there might
  be less wellknown fonts that bring across the same feel.\r\n"

  body: "Now in relation to the original post and request.. I dont think any of the
    shown ideas and sketches are very 'provocative'.. Some of them may look nice,
    but none of these would really provoke, someone.. Not me, at least.. <em>( Maybe
    they shouldnt be too provocative, like you stated in the original post.. I think
    you may have to think about bordering, or even finding the crossing line, between
    corporate and provocative 'enough'.. But, I like the slight 'roughness' / 'rawness'
    of the 3rd one.. )</em>\r\n\r\nWhat about trying and concentrating on the positive
    'effects' these trainings will have on the 'high end managers', but also on the
    provoking 'raw' feeling of the word 'provokatief'.? <em>( Maybe try one with setting
    the word 'PROvokatief', with emphasis on the positive 'PRO' part, in a slightly
    worn out and maybe even slightly grungy, but still legible typeface.? )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

    the contrast, maybe mixing styles and pulling in a K (or other letter) from another
    face. You might find a mix could do what the color contrast accomplishes."

  body: "I think #1 and #3 have the most potential right now. A agree with James though,
    that perhaps #1 could benefit from more contrast between the word and the 'k'.
    \r\n\r\nThe concept behind #3 of \"turning your world upside-down\" says the most,
    but the relationship of the mark and the type doesn't do much for me. \r\n\r\nThe
    one with the exclaimation point -- #2 -- reads more like two different words:
    \r\nProv katief ... which just leads my eye to read the girl's name \"Katie\"
    inside the words."

  body: "Number 1 without a doubt. The reverse k draws the eye immediately and provokes
    reaction, as you want to achieve.\r\n\r\nMaybe try the whole wordmark in single
    colour (magenta?). The k sticks out enough due to it being reversed; you don't
    need to single it out using vivid colour to emphasise it - it breaks up the word.
    This might be just me, but I'd like to read it and during the process of reading
    have the k jump out (and you'd 'get it'). If it's hitting you smack bang in the
    face then you read the k immediately before trying to read the wordmark.\r\n\r\nwdq154226

  body: "Thanks so much for looking into it. I agree on the first being the most potential.
    It is the most self contained one. I agree with Duckworth about making the whole
    wordmark unicolor; as it is now the k stands out in three ways: orientation, color
    and the spelling. Two might be more than enough.\r\n\r\nStrange enough this was
    one of the rare cases my first idea turned out to be the most potential. Doesn't
    happen often. :-)\r\n\r\nI'll get back to you all after meeting the client - for
    which i have some more ammunition now.\r\n\r\nThanks, again."
