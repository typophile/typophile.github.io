  body: Can't identify it but as usual for this kind of techy-vibe font, there's a
    big chance to find it through [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]] and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501|Basic
    > Sans serif]] DaFont sections. That'd probably be a bit long but you'd find at
    least good decent alernatives. Good luck :)
