  FontLab. I've tried printing to PDF directly and also printing to a PostScript file
  and then using Distiller to turn that into a PDF, and I keep running into the same
  problem of the glyphs in the table (but not the glyph cell labels) have some funny
  curve and kinks that aren't in the glyph outlines (in FontLab). \r\n\r\nI've tried
  this with a few different fonts but keep having the same problem. Also, I've spoken
  with a friend at a large type foundry and she seems to have the same problem. Wondering
  if this is a known issue and if so, is there a way to fix it?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    font, but the glyphs are rendered as outlines. It's quite possible that the outline
    drawing procedure is somewhat buggy. \r\n\r\nWe plan to improve this in the next
    release. \r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd."
