  or altered any way?

  body: hey Adam, glad you chimed in. I just had another question about this subject.
    I&#39;m looking at Minion Pro&#39;s OT definition file and in the locl feature
    it substitutes Scedilla with Scommaaccent in Moldavian but everything I&#39;ve
    read says that this should be for Romanian. Is it the same for both languages?
    where can i find a list of language abreviations used in opentype scripting? and
    lastly are there any other localized substitutions i should know of for latin
    script? thanks again for your time and help. i really appreciate it.

    <BR>Paul,  <BR> <BR>you should use the localized substitution for both Romanian
    and Moldavian. For the abbreviations, please look into the References section

    If you want to display a spacing commaaccent, the correct character sequence is
    space&#43;commaaccent, although how well this actually renders depends on the
    font. <BR> <BR>Note that when applied to the lowercase g, the commaaccent is rotated
    180 degrees and placed above the letter: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/56674.gif"
