  body: Oh, now I get it. <BR>I think it&#39;s very simple. Uppercase need to be slightly
    heavier than lowercase. Otherwise, since Uc letters have more white space around
    them, they &#40;Uc&#41; would look lighter than lc. <BR>But it should be just
    a slight extra weight. No more than 110%, I think. Of course, this percentage
    depends on the typeface too, some typeface may need more Uc extra weight. <BR>A
    priori, there&#39;s no negative consequences. It&#39;s just a necessary optical
    adjustment.

    <BR> <BR>I think the variation in your numbers is mostly due to each typeface
    needing a particular adjustment. The important is that, in the end, you should
    achieve a good &#40;even&#41; text color.

    a difinative answer on this yet. I scaled back the caps in my Friday Fonts thread.
    They went from 112% to 106%. What i wanted was for them to optically look the

  body: BJ, <BR> <BR>Have you made any headway on your 20-25 fonts? I&#39;d like to
    see a broader sampling, and more contemporary designs &#40;last 10years&#41; to
    see how they stack up. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve decided my personal preference is between
    103 - 110%. Anything more seems dark to me. Although I must admit my test is flawed.
    I&#39;m comparing horizontal width of the stem of the h with the stem of the H.
    This doesn&#39;t neccesarily fully take into account the font&#39;s modulation.
    For example, Adobe Garamond. The roman weight is 111%, but text settings don&#39;t
    look dark. I think this is because on the &#34;width of lc &#39;o&#39; = UC stem&#34;
    test the caps looked narrow. This tells me the over all color is even, dispite
    the &#34;heavy&#34; % <BR> <BR>Hope that makes some sense? <BR> <BR>Randy

    an  <BR>&#42;optical&#42; compensation, so you have to &#42;look&#42; and see  <BR>what
    it needs. Some designs might need more, some  <BR>might not. It may also depend
    a little upon cultural trends,  <BR>and also perhaps printing technology &#40;see
    below&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you had asked me I probably would have told you  <BR>that
    I made the Whitman capital stem 110% of the  <BR>lowercase. But I see now that
    I didn&#39;t. Go figure. <BR> <BR>In writing about the cutting of Linotype Monticello  <BR>&#40;a
    revival of Binny &amp; Ronaldson&#39;s Pica Roman No. 1,  <BR><i>aka</i> Oxford&#41;
    C.H. Griffith wrote that he was surprised  <BR>at how heavy the capitals appeared
    in contemporary  <BR>proofs made with type freshly cast from the original  <BR>matrices,
    compared to specimens from the original era.  <BR>The theory he developed was
    that 19th century printing  <BR>technique tended to build up more color on the
    lowercase  <BR>than the capitals and the typefounder then added more  <BR>weight
    to the capitals to compensate and get them to  <BR>print more in harmony with
    the lowercase. But 20th  <BR>century technique did not have the same effect and
    so  <BR>the extra weight in the capitals was more pronounced  <BR>in his contemporary
    proofs. The result is that he slimmed  <BR>down the weight in the capitals in
    order to get an  <BR>equivalent harmony in Linotype Monticello. <BR> <BR>I seem
    to remember Matthew saying that when he did  <BR>his recent digital revival of
    Monticello, he chose to slim  <BR>the weight of the capitals even further, relative
    to the  <BR>lowercase, because the capitals of 19th-century style  <BR>types &#40;even
    as adjusted by Griffith in the 50s&#41; still  <BR>tended to look too heavy to
    the modern eye.  <BR> <BR>I say, Trust your eyes. And if you don&#39;t trust your
    eyes  <BR>yet, then train them by looking closely at other typefaces  <BR>and
    developing your own judgement about which look  <BR>balanced in the capitals and
    which do not. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>

  body: '&#62; C.H. Griffith wrote that he was surprised at how heavy the capitals
    appeared in contemporary proofs made with type freshly cast from the original
    matrices, compared to specimens from the original era <BR> <BR>Is it possible
    this has to do with gain &#40;which was greater in the past&#41;, since a certain
    [absolute] amount of gain applied to both lc and UC bodies would actually bring
    them closer in relative weight? &#40;This would also affect stroke contrast, in
    fact to an even greater extent.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, it also happens
    that caps are sometimes made intentionally much darker than the lc. Usually this
    happens in very small sizes and/or darker weights, where all-caps setting might
    benefit from extra punch. I remember David Berlow saying something to this effect
    on the ATypI list a while back. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: These kind of analyse remember me the Commission Jaugeon who done the most
    horrible typeface called Romain du Roi, particularly the italic -- corrected visually
    by the punchcutter, who never tell what he have done to them! Others done similar
    with geometric analyse of Roman inscriptions with compas and rules, funny! <BR>
    <BR>There is no strict rules for such things, my Parisine, a bit like Gill Sans
    seems to have quite heavy caps, just because I want them like that &#40;for some
    reasons that I know well&#41;, others, such Stone or Minion show pretty light
    caps, &#34;et alors?&#34; Its matter of taste, &#34;culture&#34; and so on. <BR>
    <BR>If you start a new typeface from a compilation of everything found on various
    typefaces, you will get probably the most boring typeface ever. no? <BR> <BR>Type
    design is more feeling than maths.

    i don&#39;t think these are rhetorical questions.  <BR> <BR>Mortimer Leach - he,
    for example, drew curves - 1/3 wider than the straight stems. you can study his
    artwork. and compare it.  <BR> <BR>you can agree with his &#34;method&#34;/method
    - or not. and always ask - why 1/3 wider?  <BR> <BR>is that fixed? quantitative?
    subjective? <BR> <BR>a good study is Bodoni &#40;1926&#41; and Sheldon &#40;1947&#41;  -
    same cap height, not the same  x-height - Sheldon is more-more generous with x-height.
    and , of course, not the same ascenders &amp; descenders. <BR> <BR>so --- is that
    fixed? quantitative?  <BR> <BR>that&#39;s my opinion. maybe i&#39;m wrong. or

    subjective? <BR> <BR>See, in this case &#40;if I understand your questions  <BR>correctly&#41;,
    the more we try to achieve &#34;fixed&#34; values  <BR>&#40;proportions, weights,
    etc&#41;, the more we get arbitrary  <BR>&#40;&#34;subjective&#34;&#41; ones.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know much about Leach&#39;s work, so I may be  <BR>wrong,
    but his method sounds highly arbitrary to me,  <BR>because it doesn&#39;t seem
    to care about other factors  <BR>that might affect optical compensation. For example,  <BR>heavy
    typefaces would need larger &#40;round-shapes&#41;  <BR>compensation than thin
    ones. <BR> <BR>&#62;a good study is Bodoni and Sheldon [...] <BR>&#62;so --- is
    that fixed? quantitative? <BR> <BR>I think you kinda answered your own question.
    ;-&#41; <BR>It&#39;s not fixed, each typeface has its very own  <BR>proportions
    &#40;horizontal, vertical, weights, contrasts,  <BR>etc&#41;. And all those little

    questioning <BR>&#42;is&#42; the answer itself. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>'
