  for the typeface for this logo; it's definitely a boutique retro script, but I can't

  body: i'm sure it's [[lettering]] and not a font. that is how it usually works for

  body: Try House Industries "Signpainter." It's not exact, but is the style your
    looking for and could be modified for a similar look.
