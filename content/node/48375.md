body: "Hi \r\n\r\nAnyone know what the Tate Modern/Britain corporate font is? And
  whether its commercially available? To my untrained eye it looks like a bespoke
  cut of Vag Rounded Light, but not sure. Feels a bit more elegant than Vag.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\nthanks,[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tate_3680.jpg]"

  body: "I know this is a bit late, but you're correct, it is Vag Rounded.\r\n\r\nThat
    sarky fellow who suggested you \"do a search first\" was way off - Wolff Olins
    designed the distinctive Tate logo, but the font was commissioned by Newlyn: http://www.newlyn.com/work/client/tate\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I can see, it's not commercially available, but the suggestions you've
    had are good alternatives. There are also, it seems, various people who have emulated
    the font itself, though in my opinion it needs some tweaking. \r\nFor example:
    http://fontzone.net/font-details/Tate-Regular/\r\nthough in this one the lower
    case \"t\" needs to have its tail removed. \r\n\r\nI hope that's been a bit helpful!\r\n\r\n...and
    Marten Fischer should take his own advice next time and do a proper search."

    Vag Rounded and modified it - exactly what the OP said. \r\nSo he was exactly
    right when he said, \"To my untrained eye it looks like a bespoke cut of Vag Rounded
    Light\". :) should have made that clearer!!"

    the right "t" but close in other regards.
