    you trying to figure out how to use type within 3D VFX?\r\n\r\nI don't know 3D
    VFX, I was just trying to help you with your question."

  body: "pitomoro needs to know \"that typeface.\" In Spanish (pitomoro lives in Spain),
    the word \"tipograf\xEDa\" is used to designate both the discipline of typography
    <em>and</em> the entities we English-speakers call typefaces; hence, pitomoro
    is trying to identify a typeface.\r\n\r\nPitomoro, can you post an image of the
    font or typeface you want to identify?\r\n\r\nIn Spanish: Pitomoro, \xBFpuedes
    subir una imagen de la tipograf\xEDa que quieres identificar?"
