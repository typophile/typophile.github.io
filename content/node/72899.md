body: "Wondering about the name of this font that was used throughout the 2009 Seattle
  Book. I've seen it elsewhere also, just can't come up with a visual example. anyways
  here's the cover of the Seattle Book...hopefully someone can identify this typeface.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sharp@wilmerco_3673.com_20100706_175703.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  comes in different weights that make it suitable for text type as well. A seemingly
  versatile and modern/technological typeface."

  body: I agree. Thank you! Too bad it is so expensive haha! Of course I would want
    all the weights and variations :) Time to save up.
