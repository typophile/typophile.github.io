body: "Hey Guys,\r\nI'm wondering if anyone can identify the typeface (Japanese Sign
  Language)? I'm also looking for alternate suggestions for asian inspired serif fonts
  (I've done a typophile search and have discoved a few limited options) I really
  want to stay away from any \"cheesy\" chinese style chop socky/takeout fonts. As
  well, I'm looking for a nice high quality calligraphy option (I realize the example
  provided is likely hand drawn) Thanks for any suggestions guys! \r\nm[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img1_5177.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/img2_5737.jpg]"
