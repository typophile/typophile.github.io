  If so, how does one go about programming these types of subs?

  body: "AFAIK, no currently shipping Adobe programs support these (not counting ME
    versions - these may very well).\r\n\r\nProgramming them would be easy in FontLab,
    though I'm not sure the FDK code used by FontLab supports them either. Version
    2.1 will, but that's not due out until much later this year (2.0 is due soon,
    though).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
