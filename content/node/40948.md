  target=\"_blank\">Font Family Naming in FontLab</a> the family grouping only covers
  the 'Short Family' and 'Short Style' from Light through Bold and Condensed.\r\n\r\nI'm
  curious what the Short Family and Short Style would be for a 'Black' or 'UltraLight'
  or 'Thin'?\r\n\r\nBeing that \r\n\r\n<strong>My Garamond | Light</strong> becomes
  <strong>My Garamond Lt | Regular</strong>\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<strong>My Garamond
  | Bold</strong> becomes <strong>My Garamond Rg | Bold</strong>\r\n\r\nis it assumed
  that\r\n\r\n<strong>My Garamond | Thin</strong> would become <strong>My Garamond
  Th | Regular</strong>\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n<strong>My Garamond | Black</strong> would
  become <strong>My Garamond Rg | Black</strong>\r\n\r\nIs there any documents that
  show the breakdown of all font style possibilities between Long and Short families
  as well as Long and Short styles?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The \"Short style\" should always be one of the four: \"Regular\", \"Italic\",
    \"Bold\", \"Bold Italic\". An easy way to construct the \"Short family\" name
    is for those fonts that will have \"Regular\" as their Short style to take the
    \"Long family\" and append the \"Long style\" to it (separated by space). All
    the fonts with a Short style equal \"Italic\", \"Bold\" or \"Bold Italic\" should,
    of course, have the \"Short family\" be the same as that of the corresponding
    \"Regular\" short style. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
