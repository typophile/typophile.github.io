body: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic designer, and have decided after reading so
  much on the subject to finally roll up my sleeves and start dabbling with type design
  myself. I've chosen a simple, upper-case, sans serif display face meant for poster
  work to start with in order to get myself acclimatized with the process. The results
  so far have been plenty satisfactory, and I've had a blast fleshing out my type
  with punctuation, numerals, and accents.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering at this stage if you
  guys might have any advice on how to approach designing bolder weights. I recall
  coming across a handy article or two that gave some practical pointers, though those
  links elude me. I've got a general idea on how to proceed, filling in counters and
  such, but in practise, some letters like the S are a bit of a pickle to boldify.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nNathaniel"

    in and started tweaking everything manually, but any help, even to roughly flesh
    out a family is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nShinn, I've yet to even open up the hood
    and fix my spacing and sidebearing issues, though that's next on my list. Kudos. "

    spacing, and the relative weight of letters.\r\nThe point I was trying to make,
    although perhaps not very well, is that the relationship between these and the
    way it informs letter shape decisions can be analyzed with the help of awkward
    (e.g. shitty) words, and different spacing strategies\u2014most obviously \u201Cmanual\u201D
    and automated kerning. Here are three typefaces with /S unfolded to varying degrees,
    compared in this manner:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shitty_6676.png]\r\n(Please
    pardon the rude word, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything more useful :-)"

    could dual boot Windows or use Parallels or one of the other Mac tools that allows
    you to run Windows, if you want to cut down on switching between computers. John
    Hudson has discussed this approach, based on a different workflow, elsewhere on
    the site (I will try and find the relevant post)."

  body: "Hey Karl, \r\nThanks a lot for the suggestion. But Macs are expensive. I
    don't intend to start a war here but for the specs they are offering, I feel people
    are getting ripped off. And on top of it, I don't live in US. So extra customs
    duty. And honestly,  \"crashing windows\" and \"blue screen of death\" are old
    terms. My PC crashed just 2 times in 4 years. But that is not gonna stop from
    buying a mac. The only option is mac mini which is around $730( this is the cheapest
    mac available). I have to save  as I want to attend a type design school in some
    3-4 years and every penny counts. \r\nLucky for me, font design software aren't
    RAM guzzlers, so I think i can get away with the under-performing mac mini.\r\nCheers\r\nTypogruffer"

  body: Ah, Shinn thank you. Indeed I'm learning that letters in isolation can look
    pristine and beautiful, but don't function quite as expected when lumped together
    within the context of actual words!

    some snapshots of the work in progress. Just as a caveat, I'm mainly creating
    this for personal use, as some of the glyphs have been frankenstein-ed together
    and modified from early sans serifs.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
