body: So, I&#39;m in the process of redesigning the magazine I work on, which used
  to be two magazines, but is now just one. Both magazines use a combination of sans
  serif and serif, mostly used to set sidebars and other info from the running text.
  So far, these are the faces I&#39;ve looked at because of their huge set of weights.
  <BR> <BR>FF Scala &amp; Scala Sans &#40;nice, but...&#41; <BR>FF Zine Sans &amp;
  Serif &#40;a little wonky&#41; <BR>FF Page Sans &amp; Serif &#40;very nice, but
  some weird weight shifting in the design&#41; <BR> <BR>Previously, one magazine
  used FF TheSans &amp; TheSerif while the other used Adobe&#39;s Celestia Antiqua
  &amp; Scala Sans. I find FF Thesis a pain in the butt to work with because of the
  way the weights are set up, bold jumps to small caps, and the way the fonts show
  up in menus makes it a pain for the editor to work with the text. My editors do
  most of the text formatting &#40;and there&#39;s a lot of it to be done&#41;, so
  FF Thesis is no longer really an option. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for suggestions
  for humanist sans serifs with a matching serif. I need full families with small
  caps, etc. since I use all that stuff fairly regularly. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts?

  body: Sean, I wouldn&#39;t take suggestions for matching your sans and serif faces.
    As an art director with any sense of style, that&#39;s probably the key creative
    decision you will make, as the relationship defines the personality of the magazine.
    You should determine it yourself, based on the way you will use the faces together.
    And the more unusual and personal a pairing you can make, the more distinctive
    the personality of your magazine.

    <BR> <BR>Nick, I respect what you&#39;re saying, but surely you can&#39;t think
    that all designers who tackle creating a matching set of fonts have designed in
    blandness? <BR> <BR>The reason that I turned to the folks here is that the knowlege
    of what exists and is available is enormous. People have favorites &#40;I know
    I&#39;m quite fond of using 20th Century from Monotype&#41;, but I was hoping
    &#40;and recieved&#41; for a few new faces to search out and try. <BR> <BR>So,
    after a bit of trial and error, I decided to go with Scala and Scala Sans, using
    the Shire Types for article titles and folios, and Dispatch and Stainless for
    subheads. The magazine is split between Lord of the Rings type articles and general
    news, so I wanted the humanist but slick design of Scala Sans for the general
    news, but the humanist serif of Scala for the LotR style stuff. <BR> <BR>But,
    this brings up another point, what is your favorite &#34;strange&#34; mix of fonts?
    Mine was using Rotis Semi-Serif and Agency. It worked quite well, I even used
    Rotis Serif Italic for all the italic &#40;Semi-Serif doesn&#39;t have proper
    italic&#41;.'

  body: '&#62;but surely you can&#39;t think that all designers who tackle creating
    a matching set of fonts have designed in blandness? <BR> <BR>No, some make a point
    of constructing the sans and serif quite differently, eg Fedra. However, there
    are also quite a few where the serif is just the sans with serifs pasted on. Also,
    if the point of having sans and serif is to provide contrast in a layout, using
    a mega family that provides both reduces that effect. <BR> <BR>Having said that,
    I once designed a publication using Gill Sans and Gill Serif &#40;aka Perpetua&#41;,
    and it worked out nicely: Perpetua Titling and the condensed Sans were very useful,
    and the over-the-top Gill Sans Ultra Bold, surrounded by total Gillosity, wasn&#39;t
    too bizarre at all. <BR> <BR>BTW, who did design Gill Sans Ultra Bold, surely
    not Eric...? <BR> <BR>&#62;what is your favorite &#34;strange&#34; mix of fonts?
    <BR> <BR>I used Meta for Heads and sidebars, and Paradigm for main text, when
    I redesigned Cycle Canada in 1996. It&#39;s a motorcycle mag, so to accomodate
    the vibe of both hyper modern Japanese rocket bikes and retro-styled US hogs,
    I figured that would be OK. '

    That said, Gill didn&#39;t draw the heavier/iest weights of Gill Sans, the monotype
    office did. He referred to it as &#34;elephans&#34; as it looked like an elephant

  body: "Years later, but for the record, another voice on the question of Gill's
    involvement in Gill Sans Ultra Bold: Albert Sperisen defended Gill from the criticism
    in Robert Harling's <em>Letter Forms and Type Designs of Eric Gill</em> like this:\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026
    Again, without proper checking, Harling gets a bit rough when he speaks of Gill\u2019s
    \u201Cpeccadilloes\u201D in his \u201Chorrendous and blackguardly\u2026 display
    exploitations\u201D of Gill Sans, the fat version known as Gill Sans Ultra Bold.
    The less said about this unfortunate version the better, but the fact remains
    that this \u201Cadaptation\u201D was made by an apprentice under Gill\u2019s supervision,
    a practice for all things made in the Gill workshop. (The source for this latter
    statement is a recent interview with one of Gill\u2019s apprentices.) Gill accepted
    this commission from the Monotype works under duress. He put off doing anything
    about it for too long, until repeated demands produced what Gill labeled </cite>Sans-Elefans<cite>,
    a tongue-in-cheek title for a publicity letter in which Gill had no interest.
    This crass commercialism on the part of Monotype was no different from that of
    other type foundries when they \u201Ccreated\u201D from overly popular typefaces,
    and almost all of those variations were the product of foundry \u201Cart departments.\u201D
    Too, if the criticism of Gill is valid, it must be remembered that Stanley Morison
    was in charge at Monotype!\r\n</cite>"
