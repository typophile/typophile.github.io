  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I know it sounds like I am asking for homework help and I guess I am. I have looked and looked and can&rsquo;t figure out which historical style script/handwritten typefaces fit into. The easy thing for me to do for the paper I have to write along with a song lyric poster would be to choose something easier :) But I am totally hung up on Caflisch Script and want to use this for my music lyrics poster. Thinking of a song by Evanescence. Soooo, I need to know which historical style Caflisch fits into, find some other fonts in that same historical style, so I can write my paper and create my poster.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!!!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not to do your homework for you, but the Hoefler/Frere-Jones blog had a great entry this past week on handwriting/scripts&raquo; <a href="http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=80">http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=80</a> .</p>
<p>In Arabic, Indian, and East Asian cultures, you see much more of a connection between their typography and their handwriting, and you might argue that in many of these places typography essentially IS handwriting, just adapted to current technologies. Of course, we forget that our own Latin alphabet is based off handwriting, probably because so many of our classic typefaces feel so constructed and architectural.</p>
<p>If you have time, you should definitely check out Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Stroke,&rdquo; which argues that rather than classifying fonts as serif vs. sans serif, or Egyptian, transitional, Venetian, etc. &ndash; the typical classifications we learn in typography 101 &ndash; we should classify them as being based on their underlying constructions, which are based on the movement of the pen. Noordzij classifies all fonts as having either a &ldquo;pointed pen&rdquo; construction (an example would be Bodoni), or a &ldquo;broad nib&rdquo; construction (German blackletter shows this pen technique very clearly). In Noordzij&rsquo;s classification system, even a typeface like Helvetica can be classified as having a pointed pen construction, just with a very low contrast between thicks and thins. The Letterror type foundry has some of Noordzij&rsquo;s writing up online <a href="http://www.letterror.com/noordzij/index.html">http://www.letterror.com/noordzij/index.html</a>. My personal opinion is Noordzij tends to look at the world of type through a very narrow lens, but it&rsquo;s a fascinating perspective to gain and one that seems to be lacking from American typography education.</p>
<p>All of this relates to your question because almost all script typefaces, and particularly Caflisch, are attempting to emulate calligraphy. You might want to contact Alejandro Paul, who runs Sudtipos, because most of his script typefaces are based on American commercial lettering from the first half of the 20th century. His fonts are the sort of thing you would have seen in the department store windows of downtown Chicago and New York, hand-painted of course. While there were certainly numerous &ldquo;script typefaces&rdquo; a printshop could buy in metal type, and then photolettering sets, before the days of digital fonts, Caflisch is the kind of font that takes great pains to make you believe it&rsquo;s hand-lettered. I&rsquo;d imagine it&rsquo;s this quality that you&rsquo;re attracted to. So, if you&rsquo;re trying to trace back the roots of these sorts of organic, loose scripts, you should probably look into the history of calligraphy and lettering more than typography.</p>
