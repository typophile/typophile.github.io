  body: Looks like Bitsumishi to me. The [[http://www.dafont.com/bitsumishi.font|former
    free for personal use version]] would need a little bit of tweaking so may switching
    for the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/bitsumishi-pro-v2|Pro version]]
    and get some stylistic alternates (mainly /R) should do the job.
