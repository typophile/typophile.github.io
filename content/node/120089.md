  looking for the name of this font (a kind of classic mono serif). It comes from
  a little french book without any credits\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks by advance.\r\n\r\nGreetings
  from Paris,\r\nGG"

    of decades it might be worth trying to track down a clean light weight digital
    typewriter. IIRC there are some possibles that are not at Myfonts.\r\nDon"

    Maybe the text was really typewrited ?"

  body: "Yes, in 1984 some books were typed on an IBM Selectric typewriter, or a similar
    good quality typewriter from another source and the results were photographed
    for printing. Note the handwritten Greek phrase. \r\nWe can check the design against
    some of the popular typefaces used on IBM \"elements\" -- the thing that looks
    like a golfball -- and see if it is digitized. They had names like _courier_,
    _prestige_, _elite_ etc.\r\nHere is a selection of these typefaces compiled by
    Luc Devroye http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html If you can find some of the
    distinctive letters in the book, like _Q_, _R_, _g_ and _3_ it makes it easier
    to decide on a match.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don, thanks for your reply and for the link. A friend of mine found the
    font ! Like you say it comes from a IBM Selectric typewriter : it's called Delegate
    (look at the K, it matches : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2425128/Screenshot%202014-10-02%20%C3%A0%2011.27.50.jpg
    !). My friend says there is not clean digitized version of this font -- just this
    dirty free one : http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/delegate.html ! But some specimen
    exist, so we think about digitizing it in the future ;-)\r\n"

    of Delegate. It produced a presentation quality document with a subtle variation
    in stroke weight that made it much more attractive for publication than most typewriter
    typefaces.\r\nBTW Triplicate is well made, but it's rather different than the
    Delegate typeface for the Selectric.\r\nDon"
