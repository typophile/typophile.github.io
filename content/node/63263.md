body: "Hi,\r\nI want to make a typographic poster for a competition, precisely, I
  want to make a custom calligraphic script.\r\nThe problem is: I don't know calligraphy
  at all and the deadline is 1st december.\r\n\r\nThe competition is for an event
  about wine.\r\nI'm here asking for online rosources where i can learn the basics
  of calligraphy (and decorations too).\r\n\r\nI don't want to sound arrogant at all,
  I know that calligraphy is not something you can learn in weeks (or months), I know
  that I won't achieve the same results of the designer who made the examples you'll
  see below but I like to experiment, and I want to try anyway.\r\n\r\nHere are a
  couple of examples by a talented designer I found through the behance network, that
  can give you an idea of what I want to try:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/537151241782189_5221.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/evev_4825.jpg]"

  body: Have you considered building upon existing fonts to achieve the same look?
    It could still be a lot of work, but perhaps you'd be able to hit your deadline
    a little easier while still keeping a master's touch to the look.

  body: "I'm in the same situation as Bezier Abuser.\r\n\r\nI want to make one of
    these flourishy, embellished, calligraphic marks. Sorry to crowd the bandwagon.\r\n\r\nHere
    are some of the options I'm considering.\r\n\r\n1. RENOVATE. As mentioned, building
    off an existing font seems like it would be efficient. But that assumes that one
    has the right font. Even then, you gotta tweak the letters and add the flourishes
    and tails.\r\n\r\n2. SCRATCH. Personally, I think the best way to go is to work
    from a sketch and scan. And it doesn't necessarily preclude the use of an existing
    font. It can be used with method #1.\r\n\r\n3. TABLET. I've never used a tablet
    for calligraphy. Anyone out there use a tablet for this type of work?\r\n"

  body: Good options- I can't say I've personally designed a calligraphic font from
    scratch, but I have used a tablet to edit a few, and I personally enjoy working
    with a drawing pen much more than a mouse- it just feels more natural and sometimes
    I can get some interesting shapes or dynamics in the artwork.
