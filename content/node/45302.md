body: I'm looking for (and loving!) a font called "Boomer." Does anyone know if it's
  available to purchase or was it created as a custom font for several publications?
  If it's not available to purchase, can anyone suggest another font that is very
  close to Boomer? thanks!

  body: You're right, it says that it's available, but where... maybe Font Bureau,
    although their site does not list it, even as a custom font. Any thoughts on a
    font that is very close to Boomer?

    e-mail. Fonts that are part of FB's Studio library won't necessarily show up or
    even be mentioned on their website, but might be available for license to publications
    (as long as the original commissioning party did not pay for exclusivity or the
    term has run out).\r\n\r\nThink of it as more like haute couture than pr\xEAt-\xE0-porter.\r\n\r\n--
