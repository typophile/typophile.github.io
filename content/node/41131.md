    justify the purchase.\r\nIf you are working on a project for someone do you just
    add it to the cost?"

    cost of the license(s) to the client* because I know I will be using it again
    in the future and consider it the cost of doing business as a graphic designer.\r\n\r\n*Unless
    it is something the client requests and is so heinous that I want nothing to do
    with it afterward. In that case I do charge the client and transfer the license
    to them upon completion. :^P"
