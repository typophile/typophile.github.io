    company to check if the font really is included in the cd, and if there is some
    way to buy it single.\r\n\r\nCheck the page (it also has a tiny picture of some

    Can they be trusted if I want to buy the font?"

  body: I found a copy online and it turns out to be a somewhat crude school-type
    script font copyrighted by Autodesk, 1996. So, selectedworks, if that sounds like
    your font, then it's likely that the only legitimate source is via an Autodesk
    software program.

  body: 'ScriptS is mentioned in Luc Devroye''s page http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/autocad.html
    where he even gives a (dead) link to a file containing the fonts.  I could also
    find a font named ScriptS with Autodesk''s copyright. I could hardly believe it:
    all the contours are piecewise linear (there is no curve, only straight lines).
    Is that a joke like <a href="http://typophile.com/node/37359">Euroface</a>? '

    folder as well, and a mirror to boot. It's extremely unlikely that this was done

  body: "When CS2 was released the bonus font URL was made public. It was an accident.
    This looks like it is part of an older structure that is why I felt the need to
    ask. I'm very wary of people downloading old software just to get to a font when
    there are so many other fonts available for license. Is it really worth all of
    the trouble? Are we getting access to quality fonts by doing so?\r\n\r\nHmm. That
    is supposed to sound like a rant. ;^D"

    any difficulty, from one of the zip files. Some of the fonts there are very clearly
    not free fonts and, in my opinion, the above site should not be accessible. As
    for the font ScriptS, given the circumstances, I will wait till Tiffany gets an
    answer about it.\r\n\r\nMichel"
