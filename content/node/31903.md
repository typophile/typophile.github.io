  my FontLab 5.02 doesn't work in the way is described in the article despite I've
  filled the Font Info in the way is indicated in the Adam Twardoch's article (Long
  family, long style, etc.)\r\n\r\nFor example> The article says I should see 4 suitcases
  from the beginning , but it is not the case: I only see that if I click the checkbox
  \"ATR-compatible\".\r\n\r\nI guess maybe the article was written for FL 4.6....
  Can anybody confirm that?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"
