  a bit of critiscm. \r\nI have removed the parts and just have the foundations of
  the letter shapes.\r\nI dont mind this now i have created the letters in illustrator
  because i am like the  the tools available. \r\nHowever  there is a grid i hear
  people tallking about on the forums , i am designing  my letters without the correct
  proportions to the grid. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/old skool

  body: Spacing is not normally mathematical, nor do letter shapes need to be the
    same width (unless that is a design feature you are seeking). In the sample above,
    the fact that the L is so wide, and the fact that the right side of the letter
    is so open, means that you would probably want to kern that space more than the
    other side. I would also look at shortening 20 to 25% of the bottom line of the
    L.

  body: 'these are not can not be kerned there created in illustrator. I would move

  body: If they are in AI, try moving the end of the L about 30% of the way to the
    left. Then move the d and give it 3/4 of the space of the prior character. See
    if that looks better.

  body: Perhaps the "mystery grid" is the grid on a computer display - thus, <em>hinting</em>
    would cause your font to have the kind of grid alignment you're illustrating when
    it is displayed in a sufficiently small size, so as to coincide with the pixels.
