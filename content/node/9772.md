  body: Bringhurst has some good tips on putting fonts together in his <i>Elements
    of Typographic Style</i>. When I&#39;m trying to match fonts, I tend to look at
    things like weight, relative width, and the various heights &#40;x-height, ascenders,
    descenders&#41;, and think about things like style and shape. If you can come
    close to matching &#40;or purposefully not matching&#41; the inner logic of the
    type you&#39;re using, it&#39;ll look a lot more harmonious on the page, regardless
    of how different the fonts look outwardly.
