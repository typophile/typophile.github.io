body: "LeFran\xE7ois is a typeface in OpenType format based on 3 series of capitals.\r\nIt
  seems to be classical but some glyphs show that it's not so conventional.\r\nIt's
  seems to be a typical French type, that's why its name is LeFran\xE7ois (with the
  accent please !)\r\nWith a particular work on kerning (about 5000 !) and ligatures,
  you'll be able to compose words as logotypes thanks to capitals and small caps.\r\nIt
  will be soon available at http://www.editions205.fr\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeFrancois12_5391.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeFrancois22_5237.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeFrancois32_4008.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeFrancois42_4530.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeFrancois52_6632.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeFrancois62_4750.gif]"
