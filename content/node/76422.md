  topic related to lead type in general. Since we're encouraged to research a topic
  that we know little to nothing about, I thought it would be interesting to delve
  into the relationship between digital and foundry type, or more specifically, typefaces
  that were born in the digital and brought to metal post-issue. \r\n\r\nThe closest
  that I can find would be our dear friend Jim's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/rimmer/stern/|Stern]],
  which was simultaneously issued in both metal and digital forms. \r\n\r\nSo this
  might be a stretch\u2014given that the skills for producing metal type are anything
  but common in this age\u2014but is anyone familiar with any such faces or the process
  that goes into the conversion?"

  body: "Hi Peter,\r\n\r\nAs the lucky bastard who acquired Jim Rimmer's typecasting
    equipment, I'm currently beginning work on two types that I've drawn digitally
    which will eventually be cut and cast in metal. My process will be somewhat different
    than the one Jim used, but will make use of all of the machines and tools Jim
    utilized in the development of a new metal face, with the exception of Ikarus
    (used for digitizing drawings - I'll be working directly from digitally-drawn
    outlines).\r\n\r\nThere are likely more folks out there with the ability to make
    new metal types than you might think, but many (perhaps most) of them are busy
    casting type from Monotype/Linotype/Ludlow matrices, rather than cutting new mats
    for new faces. Micah Courier (at the Dale Guild) is working on cutting new mats,
    but I think only to replace those that are missing/damaged from the Guild's collection.\r\n\r\nOne
    has to consider the precision required for the production of a metal face. On
    screen, to adjust the fitting of a new type is simply a matter of shoving the
    side-bearings in Fontlab. Need to make a glyph a bit darker? No problem at all
    digitally. In metal, though, this would mean cutting a new matrix. You also have
    depth-of-drive to worry about, to be sure your type will be exactly .918\". Then
    there's kerns to worry about. Let alone the process of making a matrix that will
    actually fit/work in whatever kind of caster you're working with.\r\n\r\nAs an
    opener, I'd recommend you get your hands on Jim's book, <em>Memories from the
    Cutting Room Floor</em> (which is the trade edition of Jim's limited edition <em>Leaves
    from the Pie Tree</em>); this book walks step by step through Jim's process.\r\n\r\nThen,
    of course, there's Rich Kegler's nearly-completed documentary on Jim's process,
    <em>Making Faces</em>: <a href=\"http://makingfacesfilm.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://makingfacesfilm.blogspot.com/</a>\r\n\r\nBeyond
    all of this, I'd be happy to tell you a bit more about the process I'll be using,
    but starting with Jim's book and Rich's film is likely your best approach."

  body: "Jason,\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the sort of response I was hoping for; many
    thanks! How exciting it must be to be in possession of such equipment.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    there is a bit of a time crunch (next Wednesday), and with both the film apparently
    unreleased and the book financially challenging to acquire, it does appear that
    my citable options are rather limited. In any event, your input and clear expertise
    are appreciated, and if this topic holds promise for the academic short-term,
    I'll certainly be coming to you with questions. "

  body: "Dan Carr at Golgonooza Press is another who, like Jim (R.I.P.), is comfortable
    in both metal and digital realms. He has cut both metal and digital fonts. But
    I don't know that he has ever translated a digital design into metal. I believe
    he prefers to work directly and let the material suggest the form. \r\n\r\nI seem
    to recall Sumner Stone saying just last week that the late Gerald Giampa actually
    cut a metal version of his Stone Serif. But maybe that was only a few letters
    and not a complete font. \r\n\r\nJason -- I wondered what became of Jim's equipment.
    You lucky dog. I'm glad it all wound up in good, appreciative hands. "
