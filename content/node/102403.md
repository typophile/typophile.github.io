  blog logo. The logo should give the impression of a thought leader within the business
  sector and be able to build instant credibility. I need my name and tagline as the
  main focus of the logo. I want something that is simple yet powerful and can be
  used on my blog and social media profiles.\r\n\r\nHere is a rough concept I've done
  just to work out a layout. If I can get some thoughts on type I can then play around
  with it some more and get the spacing of everything right. I'm not a graphic designer
  but typography interests me and it's something I've been reading about and learning
  lately.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SMlogo_5233.png]"

  body: "@shanemackintosh: Good design is about making informed decisions and fitness
    for purpose. To assist people in providing you with more insightful feedback as
    opposed to subjective aesthetics, some questions:\r\n\r\n1. What do you do?\r\n2.
    Who are your clients?\r\n3. Who would you <em>like</em> your clients to eventually
    be?\r\n4. Who is your competition?\r\n5. What is your hourly rate? (a designer
    with 20 years of experience will probably go for about $100/hr+)\r\n\r\nFrom an
    aesthetic perspective, if you can get your hands on a copy of Robert Bringhurst\u2019s
    \u201CThe Elements of Typographic Style\u201D you\u2019ll find yourself way ahead
    of the pack."

    brand to be seen as a business management thought leader\r\n- I want to attract
    business owners and managers to my blog where they can read blog posts about topics
    relating to business that will help solve problems they are facing or give them
    new ideas to improve and grow their businesses\r\n- Longer term I will write books
    and use my website as a base to promote them\r\n\r\nI'll have a look for that
    book, thanks for the recommendation."
