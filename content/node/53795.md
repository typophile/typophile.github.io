  a typographer\", even \"everyone is a font designer\" and, of course, also a \"foundry\":\r\nI
  just got my hands on the magazine of <a href=\"http://www.prolitteris.ch/\">Pro
  Litteris</a>, the Swiss copyright society for literature. For some reason, they're
  now doing a series on, you guessed it, fonts. This is the first feature: \"The 12
  most readable fonts.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/readablefonts_5348.jpg]\r\nMy
  favorite comment on that spread: \"If you don't feel like designing, or don't have
  any talent, use Courier. No Design at its best!\""

    newspaper printing, but I doubt that Scala is, etc. etc. '

  body: "Yeah; I suspect this is supposed to be a \"beginners' collection\" so they
    tried to feature in a reasonable portion of the fonts that anyone would find on
    their computer anyway. Courier really baffled me too, though (\"A design masterpiece
    from the typewriter era\"!). \r\n\r\nWilliam, there are some very short (1 to
    3 short lines) comments on the individual fonts, and they actually say to handle
    Verdana with care in print. The rest of the comments seems rather\u2026 unuseful
    (\"Veto comes very close in approximating the invisible skeleton of letterforms\"
    \u2013 what's that supposed to mean, especially to laymen?).\r\n\r\nI'll be curious
    to see how this progresses. Next issue will have the \"12 most decorative fonts\"
    (Curlz anyone?) and after that, it's going to be the \"12 most visionary fonts\"
    (that's going to be interesting)."
