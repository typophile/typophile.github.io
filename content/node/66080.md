body: "Good day to all. I'm brand new to this forum and still checking it out. I've
  had a love of typography for ages and this year decided to get more pro-active about
  doing typography myself. So, here I am, to see and be seen (as it were). \r\n\r\nAnd,
  since I'm new (in good old fashioned style) the first round is on me. Here's a nifty
  wallpaper I made called [[http://jamesrandom.tumblr.com/post/322699072/mixing-type-volume-1-this-is-a-wallpaper-to|Mixing
  Typography Volume One]]. (2560X1600). It was inspired by the Periodic Table of typefaces.
  \r\n\r\nIf you'd like a 1680X1050 version, then go [[http://JamesRandom.deviantart.com/art/Mixing-Type-Volume-1-149620962|here]]
  and download. \r\n\r\nHope to have lots of fun with you all! \r\n\r\n"
