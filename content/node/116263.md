  body: "BAKTASH CHIROPRACTIC is, I think, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/|Helvetica
    Neue Condensed Black]], or the older Helvetica Inserat, futher slightly squooshed.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-gothic/|Century Gothic]]."

    Neue]].
