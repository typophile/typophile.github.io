body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twit_logo_5033.gif]\r\n\r\nCan I get a
  critique on this logo?\r\n\r\nIt is to represent me as a graphic designer.\r\nI
  work as a freelancer and will eventually be looking for work within a firm.\r\n\r\nThis
  logo is the first letter of my first name ( Mike )\r\nDo you think it is too weak
  to use my first name to rep. myself?\r\n\r\nI am aiming for something simple that
  will describe my personal style.\r\n\r\nAny feedback appreciated!"

  body: Even though there are similar shapes and the "M"-  don't you think the style
    differs enough? [ especially if I use silkscreen / stamp method on my applications
    ? ]

  body: Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's too similar to use.  There are definitely
    differences, and anyway it's probably impossible to design any logo that isn't
    similar to some other existing logo.   But it popped into my mind when I saw yours
    so I just thought I'd mention it.

    disconnected feet. Have you thought about connecting the middle two with a horizontal
    line? A bit like the Monocle logo I guess. '

    on originality. maybe what makes you different is how you apply it.

  body: "Thank you for all your comments\r\n\r\n@JamesM\r\nI think your right when
    you say it is not possible to design any mark that is not similar to another,\r\nalthough
    we all try our best to combat this, it is not always possible when within a brief.\r\n\r\n@apul\r\nthanks
    for putting that together, I think the connecting of those 2 lines works quite
    well.\r\nI am going to explore with the connectivity of the lines.\r\n\r\n@Christopher
    Dean\r\nI am a graphic designer, still discovering my niche.\r\nI need more time
    to explore design in general in order to specify myself as a certain designer.
    \r\nAlthough I have been formally trained in print.\r\n\r\n@apankrat\r\nhappy
    you recognized the subtle ( or not so subtle ) ref. to mountains\r\n\r\nLooking
    at options for embossing right now actually\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like the inverted V's pattern. You can make the 'top' one larger to get
    a perspective 3D effect.  What I do not like is the black circle background -
    it overwhelms the design. The inverted V's pattern by itself can stand out in
    black or another color (teal?) without a background.

    \"It's an 'M'\". I was more like \"Yeah I see the 'M', but there is something
    else there. 2 'A's' possibly. \r\n\r\nBut you were just intending on creating
    an 'M'. Maybe something worth considering?"

  body: "It's got a bit of the new Vancouver Whitecaps logo in it, which is probably
    fine. But somehow there's still not enough to it. \r\n\r\nHow does it look when
    you lock it up with your name? How versatile is it? And how does it work if you
    don't put it in a circle? Within the circle, it seems a bit spindly to me especially
    if you put it small on a business card.\r\n\r\nAlso: where's your portfolio?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vancouver_Whitecaps_MLS_6723.jpg]"

- body: Mike, IMO, there's no need to post a link to your portfolio here like "tmac"
    has asked. It's not always wise to link your professional website to a critique
    forum...you never know when a potential client will Google you, and discover some
    anonymous comment tearing down your work-in-progress.

    I seem to be getting a lot of resumes lately, and I also know of a good number
    of small, medium and large firms that are hiring.\r\n\r\nI don't see how it's
    a bad thing that his portfolio would be viewed by a whole bunch of people and
    it would give a sense about how the mark fits the work.\r\n\r\nMike, you asked:\r\nDo
    you think it is too weak to use my first name to rep. myself?\r\n\r\nI don't think
    it sounds weak at all. Your mark also reminds me of the Lions (2 big snowy peaks
    visible from town).\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\nTodd\r\n\r\n"
