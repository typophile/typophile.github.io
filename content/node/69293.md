  2nd year design students at Seattle Central Community College. Take note: this is
  not what you would expect! Jennifer Kennard and her partners in crime teaching animation,
  photography,printing processes and book arts have nurtured an astonishing level
  of skill and thought in their students. The show is dazzling. If you want to wonder
  if you should go back to school, or maybe just lie down and take a long nap and
  consider becoming a barista instead, take a look: xType Culture Show previewed at
  http://letterology.blogspot.com/ I think you will especially enjoy the animated
  "sand serif" alphabet created in sand on a lightbox (most of the animations can
  be seen online at the letterology link.)'

    been previously, and found that while there was a range of skill levels, there
    was certainly some very fine work.\r\n\r\nHmmm, Sand Serif, you say? Perhaps somebody
    out there is a Will Eisner fan?\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=sand+saref\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
