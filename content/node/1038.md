body: Anyone see the new cover to &#34;W&#34;, with the Kate Moss spreads? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  curious to know what the Sans face is that they are using on the cover. <BR> <BR>I
  was hoping to see it in title use throughout the mag, but no luck. Stuck with clarendon.
  <BR> <BR>Sorry couldnt find a pic of the cover. <BR> <BR>hildebrant.

    magazine and the cover is set on a bold weight of June by <a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de"

  body: Ahh.. <BR> <BR>Thanks. Funny but I have subscribed to the Magazine for a couple
    years, and this is the FIRST time I remember seeing this face. <BR> <BR>Quite
    nice, for titling, if I could say so. <BR> <BR>hildebrant. <BR>
