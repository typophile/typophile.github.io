  body: Hi Klaus, <BR> <BR>My name is Jimmy from Indonesia and I am very new to Fontographer,
    in fact I was about to learn. I was searching for an online fontographer tutorial
    on Google.com and your site came up in the search result list. <BR>Then I saw
    this thread on Typophile Forum and pretty surprised that you&#39;re the guy who
    made the tutorial site. <BR>Thank you very much, Klaus ! Your tutorial is great
    especially for someone who&#39;s learning Fontographer from zero like me. <BR>I
    you don&#39;t mind, could you add more tutorial into it because i need help understanding
    how to set the metrics, the kerning points,etc...cause, you know, i&#39;m learning
    from zero. <BR> <BR>Sorry for asking too much rather than giving you a comment
    or compliments. Once again, thank you very much for your tutorial.
