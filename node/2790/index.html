  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Right now I am working on a redesign of a logo for a textile company Velana, one of the largest producers of curtains in Central Europe. The first image shows how the logo looks like now, the other three are my proposals... <BR> <BR>Thanx! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24586.gif" alt="Velana logos"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Matjaz, <BR> <BR>My first remark would be that this approach for LC &#34;a&#34; combined with the other letters found in the name make the logotype appear uneven and unbalanced. The size ratio change is a good thing, but don&#39;t you think something in between would look better? <BR>Also, the design for &#34;v&#34; interferes with the instant recognition of the letter, thus making the name itself hard to read. out of all there, the first one is neat and has far more potential to be made into a corporate mark. <BR> <BR>George</div>

The others look somehow to fashionable for me, will be outdated in a year or two, they typo is entirely too much like a tachno-disco-flyer for my taste. This isn&#39;t simple enough, not souvereign enough. Also, the mark made sense in the original &#40;albeit a bit kitschy with the effect of flowing into the l&#41;.. bit with the new design it really makes no sense anymore.  <BR> <BR>Maybe try to keep it simpler, more classic, less fashionable.

There doesn&#39;t seem to be any problem-solving with your &#34;directions.&#34; You&#39;re just making the &#34;thread&#34; in the green square thicker and changing the typeface. Have you come up with any new ideas? <BR> <BR>I also don&#39;t see the necessity of a redesign. Maybe you could add a more natural typeface to it and create a more elegant whitespace flow inside the box...I&#39;d think about how the white-space &#34;thread&#34; flows inside the green box. It&#39;s too mechanical in yours, which is the problem I see with the original. That &#34;thread&#34; &#40;white space in the box, whatever it&#39;s supposed to be, I think of a piece of thread for sewing&#41; could flow into and out from the box better. If it&#39;s supposed to be a &#34;V&#34; then you can make it better. <BR> <BR>The type you have makes me think I&#39;m about to walk into a state-of-the-art Oxygen bar or something. I don&#39;t know much about textile companies &#40;feel free to give some more info&#41;, but this doesn&#39;t have the feel to me. <BR> <BR>What are you trying to say with this identity?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The &#34;v&#34; in the &#34;Current logo &#40;to be redesigned&#41;&#34; looks kind of like the folds in fabric or curtains.  Do you know if this was intentional?  Either way, perhaps you could make this more obvious through a reworking of the mark.  I agree with some of the other posts about the type--the &#34;Current logo &#40;to be redesigned&#41;&#34;.  I like it how it is.  It will likely endure for another twenty years.  However, it does look somewhat like Parmalat, which is not a good association in Europe right now.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24613.jpg" alt=""> <BR><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3401785.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3401785.stm</a> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The original mark is too straight, like plumbing pipes as Hrant identified. Even straight patterns in textiles have curves once you look up close. <BR> <BR>I would suggest that you do something to make this feel more human or fabric like. Not so vertical, horizontal, or straight. Make it flow. Push a more freeform, flowing direction, then if necessary, bring in some more gridded design to control the potential chaos. Am I making any sense? Some of the illustrations in the link below might help loosen you up a bit, but notice how alot of them maintain a controlled grid combined with free flowing forms. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.chapter3.net/" target="_blank">http://www.chapter3.net/</a> <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Matjaz, <BR> <BR><i>I am trying &#40;hard&#41; to balance between a very trendy ID and something that would not become a bad design tommorow.</i> <BR> <BR>The problem here IMHO, is the type. I think this kind of lettering reaks of present trends: a monoline where the v=n e=a etc. It does so in the same way that photolettering smells of the 1970s and now looks dated. So be careful with this approach. <BR> <BR>One way to distance yourself from this problem might be to use more traditional forms, but keeping the monoline &#40;eg Foundry Monoline&#41;. Or you could try a fresh take on an established genre &#40;a neo grotesque, or humanist sans, or a semiserif&#41;. How about some of Storm&#39;s offerings: Teuton, Sebastian, John Sans, or Dyna Grotesque? Maybe contact Christain Robertson about using Pill Gothic! There&#39;s an idea. Good luck! <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m going to echo most of the other posts here, and say that the old logo isn&#39;t bad, just old. I think that Daniel&#39;s suggestions tap into a good new direction. There&#39;s still a lot there in the old Velana logo. It just looks a bit stuffy, IMO. <BR> <BR>I think the type should stay close to its original &#40;in terms of the typeface&#41;, and maybe even a similar orientation of mark to type, particularly because it&#39;s quite known in Slovenia. Plus, if you keep the same rough proportions, it can be used in ways similar to the old logo. Don&#39;t be too eager to violate the brand equity. I do like your tweaking of the logo in the A examples. The B example looks nice, but starts to lose the &#39;V&#39; quality of the old mark. The dip seems too shallow to me, if you&#39;re going to make the curves more exaggerated. <BR> <BR>Be sure to emphasize to your clients the difference between &#39;new and fresh&#39;, and &#39;disposable&#39;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To Tiffany&#39;s point, the identies found in the interior design world &#40;and much of what is associated with it&#41; often uses extremely clean and simple geometry. Personally, I love that look as opposed to the alternative gaudy designs that I also find common in the industry, but it is also very refreshing when that norm is broken. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure that the resemblance of Tom&#39;s concept to cosmetics is such a bad thing. This indicates that it has a feminine appeal, which is very appropriate to the fashion and textiles industry. <BR> <BR>IMO, go with the &#34;flow&#34;. <BR> <BR>Matjaz, I like the mark on your last posting better than the other ones, but I&#39;m still not feelin&#39; the type in combination with the mark.

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps the original mark was meant to evoke curtain <i>manufacture</i> rather than curtains. Or maybe not. <BR> <BR>What if you took the the more perspective-ish style of Tom&#39;s idea and made it more regular and folded looking, like a curtain being pulled back &#40;and more like a V&#41;? Like this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24732.gif" alt="Velana suggestion"> <BR> <BR>Please forgive the rushed look. The curves would need to be repositioned, but the basic idea is there. I threw Lucida Sans under there just on a whim to see how it&#39;d look. There are better type suggestions in this thread.</div>

I think about the textiles being previewed in Azure and Metropolis, or even Metropolitan Home and House and Garden. I&#39;m obviously smitten with Design Within Reach &#40;look <a href="http://www.dwr.com/accessories.cfm?id=6&amp;group=4&amp;subc=792" target="_blank">here</a>, although I  can only afford to covet from afar. Maybe I&#39;m only one person, maybe I&#39;m completely high.  <BR> <BR>Think about Knoll. They have had that wonderful logo forever. Yeah, it came and went and came back again. But they stuck to their guns and stuck to the quality that is synonymous with their companies name. <BR> <BR>There is something interesting about the 2nd one posted by Jan Sandvik ... again, however I think the type is a little too trendy. <BR></div>

Who is the target audience for Velana, maybe I missed that, but this might be the starting point. <a href="http://www.velana.si/index_eng.php" target="_blank">Velana</a> does seem to want to portray a young hip audience. &#40;The color on their site is nice, makes me want spring.&#41; They offer some beautiful textures and colors. <BR> <BR>Do you only get 2 colors to work with? &#40;idea: What if you used a pantone metallic gray and then overprinted that a bit on one part of the logo?&#41; <BR></div>
