  body: I think the f ligatures are admirable here. 1. I like the tasteful restraint.
    2. I like the two different styles of ligatures. Very nice.

  body: "Congratulations J\xE1n, there are a lot of faces in this contemporary genre
    (whatever it is), but you've managed to create a face that's even in colour and
    understated (and hence very useful, I would expect) <em>en masse</em>, and yet
    has some very confident and distinctive letter forms\u2014a typeface with real
    personality."

  body: "I am very happy about your reaction on the typeface, because my aim actually
    was to create an universal typeface, but still somehow interesting.\r\nBut this
    family is 1/3 of the project only. I will still need to finish two other type
    families to complete Preto family.\r\nThank you!"

    may want to reconsider that blue on the samples you posted here \u2013 it's quite
    jarring."

    also - meaning \"because\" in Slovak, it is somewhat \"mean\" but very self confident.\r\nBut
    it surely works worldwide too:-)\r\nAndrej"

  body: "Well. Thank you!\r\nThe name just somehow \"pop up\", when I was unable to
    find out a good name. The time was pressure and I was asking myself, why this
    name, why that name...\r\nAnd I didn't have a good reason, why it should be named
    after the names I invented.\r\n\"Because\" (\"preto\" in slovak language) was
    the only reasonable answer I could get. :)\r\nSo the typeface name came from the
    answer."
