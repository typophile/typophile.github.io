body: "List of sans serif fonts in my PC starting with the letter \"A\":\r\n\r\n-
  <strong>AF Carplates / AFCarplates</strong>\r\nLooks like car license plate numbers.

  <strong>AG Schoolbook</strong>\r\nLike the letters on kids' flashcards in kindergarten.\r\n\r\n-

  a heavier bottom.\r\n\r\n- <strong>Advertiser</strong>\r\nWith edges that are rounded
  inwards.\r\n\r\n- <strong>Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk</strong>\r\nAn uglier version
  of Arial.\r\n\r\n- <strong>Alien League</strong>\r\nFuturistic sleek font.\r\n\r\n-

  letters.\r\n\r\n- <strong>ITC Avant Garde Gothic</strong>\r\nFeels like AG Schoolbook,
  but for adults.\r\n\r\n- <strong>Avenir</strong>\r\nSpaced out and quite classy-looking.
  Suitable for a business website to convey a professional yet warm feel.\r\n\r\n-
  <strong>Avian</strong>\r\nBroader version of Advantage."
