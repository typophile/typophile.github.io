body: "So, I'm an amateur typographer with two freeware releases. So far both of my
  fonts have done very well, and I receive at least a few emails per week asking for
  permission to use one of them for something commercial (logo, website, etc). It
  gets a bit tedious and time-consuming to reply to each of these to explain that
  they can use it, especially as they're already marked as freeware.\r\nSince I'm
  in the process of creating my third font, I'm toying with the possibility of making
  this new font free for personal use and charging a small fee for commercial use,
  simply to make it worth my time to respond to inquiries... However I don't really
  know where to start in terms of selling a font. Should I sell it through certain
  websites? Is there paperwork I need to do to protect the font from being used commercially
  without payment? What do I do if I see it being used commercially without payment?
  Since I definitely want personal use of the font to remain open, does my process
  of charging for its commercial use differ greatly from one that needs to be purchased
  for any use? Etc.\r\nIf anyone has links to resources detailing font sale, or can
  simply brief me on the process, I'd be very grateful.\r\nThank you! "

    crap. You worked hard, and you deserve to get paid for it."

    that a good way to start commercially would be MyFonts, I also think that for
    work of this quality, a foundry-distributor would be interested. And working with
    such an outfit would give you access to its experience and expertise, both business
    and technical, to answer all those questions you have. '

    up to a commercial quality, and then selling them with a (very generous) commercial
    license. I work with a nice selection of the finest freefont designers, and would
    be happy to work with you, too :)\r\n\r\nMy concept is not a sensible option if
    you want to make serious income from your creations, but it does create some extra
    pocket-money for all participants. And you can then continue to create fonts for
    fun - with just a basic character set (and release them for free if you want to)
    - and let me polish them up to a commercial quality and handle the promotion,
    hosting, sales and support. I also publish through MyFonts.\r\n\r\nLook at my
    site, and contact me if this sound like an interesting option for you ;)\r\nAnyways:
    keep up the good work whichever path you choose - your fonts are quite special,
    original and lovely.\r\n\r\nRoger\r\n-- \r\nhttp://www.CheapProFonts.com\r\nHigh

    because font development is a hobby for me, and not something that I am interested
    in taking to a high level commercially, as I prefer to focus my efforts on my
    illustration business. Second because I am an amateur and I don't consider my
    typographic work thus far to be professional enough to charge money for, though
    hopefully the quality of my work will increase in time. Thirdly because I am of
    the generation that does not believe in paying for information, be it music, movies,
    fonts, etc, and I don't expect other people to pay for something I would not pay
    for myself (no matter how unethical this seems, it is unfortunately the truth).
    And finally, my fonts are really just creative, aesthetic endeavors, and not terribly
    practical... When used in graphic design work I think they're really quite tacky,
    and honestly I'd prefer people to use them less, but if someone wants to use them
    I'm not about to stop them from doing so.\r\n\r\nSo, those are my (mostly awful)
    reasons, but you did ask. :]\r\nThank you for the website recommendations, I will
    look into them!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Looks like I joined Typophile right in time (this is my first post).\r\n\r\nTeagan,
    like you, I've just gotten into making fonts, and though I'm just getting into
    selling them, I've been making them off and on for the past few years so I still
    consider myself an amateur.  \r\n\r\nIn any case, I would have to say that I like
    the method in which I've seen several people release fonts: the basic one free
    and the remaining styles as paid (Ray Larabie comes to mind with this method)
    or alternating free and paid fonts (Nate Piekos for this one).  But I do agree
    that in the day and age when being an illustrator is harder and harder to live
    by (especially with Google's recent \"gimme free art\" stunt), charging for fonts
    is perfectly reasonable.\r\n\r\nAnd it goes without saying that I'm also looking
    at many of the suggestions made by others here as well, thanks."

    I am of the belief that people can use my illustrations for their personal enjoyment
    in any way that they like, as long as they are not profiting off of them or claiming
    them as their own. When people buy prints of my work they are doing it to support
    me, and in terms of commissions I get more business than I can take, so I guess
    I must be doing something right. I'd also like to mention that 90% of my clients
    find my work when they are browsing for freeware fonts, so I do not regret for
    a second having made them free.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if the existence of freeware
    fonts pisses you guys off because it takes away your business, but seriously,
    I posted here asking HOW to start charging for my fonts, and everyone seems to
    prefer telling me I'm an idiot for not charging for fonts than to tell me HOW
    to.\r\n"

  body: "Wow, just looked at some of your work, limetree, and I really love it.\r\n\r\nThere
    is pretty cool <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/200909.html\">font
    designer</a> who used to give his fonts away for free because he felt the same
    (thought his font designing was merely hobby). Now, he <a href=\"http://fontfabric.com/\">and
    others</a> are doing something like this:\r\n\r\nThey design entire font families,
    usually with stylish variants or complete sets with various weights and italics,
    and make the most basic font within the family free. The idea, I think, is that
    sure, a lot of people will grab only the freebies and have fun with those, but
    then they also have the enticing variants/character sets to chose from for a fair
    price.\r\n\r\nA free font \"embedded\" within a commercial set of fonts seems
    to skyrocket the popularity of the whole font family, usually thanks to the blogosphere
    promoting and featuring free fonts. Also look into using networks like Behance
    to promote your work. When I start designing typefaces, I think I will follow
    this strategy.\r\n\r\nI also got to echo your statement about being a part of
    a generation that doesn't see a value on information/data/music and would rather
    get free stuff immediately over paid stuff. But that mindset gets adjusted as
    one matures and becomes professional, especially towards software and intellectual
    property\u2014you're not so much paying for the fonts to use them for fun as you
    are to use them in a commercial environment, and to cover your ass so you don't
    end up like NBC.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
