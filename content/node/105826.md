  Looking for both fonts on this pic. Help?\r\n\r\nRegards, Mark\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image-01_6645.jpg]"

  body: "Lettered with care and precision. The script does a good job of imitating
    the a split pen nib as it spreads with increased pressure in a somewhat Spencerian
    style. As you have noted none of the usual digital suspects are an exact match.
    \r\nYou didn't mention the age of the sign. If it's from the 1950s to 1970s it's
    possible that the sign maker used a script from Photolettering, Filmotype or a
    European counterpart.\r\nClosest digital I noted is perhaps Edwardian Script.\r\nAs
    for the heavy serif, the closest digital I noted was Goudy Heavyface.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Thank you very much Don! Useful info.\r\n\r\nAge of the sign is unknown to
    me. Because my time was running out I had to go with the alternatives. I used
    Edwardian for the script, as suggested. The curls were added by hand using Illustrator's
    tool for strokes with variable width. The serif was done in ...Times :) which
    I artificially thickened a bit. The result.. ah well, I guess I have to let go
    of my crazy perfectionism.\r\n\r\nMark\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/result_3686.jpg]"

  body: "Looks good.\r\nMost people won't notice the difference.\r\nAs for your thickened
    times, compare it with the \"lost\" font \"Times Modern\" a pre-digital design
    (published digitally by Scangraphic, then Elsner+Flake as \u201CSH Times Modern\u201D
    or \u201CEF Times Modern.\u201D See: <a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/uses/3368/the-other-times-modern\">The
    Other Times Modern by Fonts in Use</a>. This is focused on a condensed font. The
    relevant part is near the end:\r\n----quote---\r\nUpdate, Mar 18, 2013: I contacted
    Albert-Jan Pool, who worked at Scangraphic from 1987\u201391. He did not remember
    Times Modern and didn\u2019t find it in his catalogs. But adds this:\r\n    \"Brendel
    Informatik [now TypeShop Collection] (Walter Brendel used to be customer of Peter
    Karow at an early stage of the development of Ikarus, part of their data were
    in some of the more obscure IK archives of URW) seems to have had some kind of
    \u201CTimes Serial\u201D called Riccione with 7 weights. Maybe E&F derived Times
    Modern from there by generating a condensed version of the bold weight?\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TS-Riccione_5144.jpg]\r\nIndeed,
    the bold weights of TS Riccione do come closer to Times Modern than anything I\u2019ve
    seen in digital form (besides E+F\u2019s now unavailable version). Riccione is
    clearly a different design, though \u2014 more cleanly drawn, with balanced counters.
    This can be a great thing for users, and the XBold is particularly nice, but it
    does miss the compressed wackiness of Times Modern if that\u2019s what you\u2019re
    seeking.\r\n--end quote---\r\nHere is a <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/riccione/xbold/\">link

  body: "Nice story, but in the end it turned out that it is more likely that TypeShop\u2019s
    Riccione was based on Modern Times Black by Lettergraphics International from
    1969 than the other way round. You can read that in the thread under the article
    in FontsInUse."

      and Modern Times Black when my initial suggestion (which proved to be wrong)
