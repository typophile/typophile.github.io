  body: On Mac OSX? No, there isn&#39;t, at least that I am aware of. Leslie Carbarga
    wrote in his <i>Logo, Font &amp; Lettering Bible</i> that it couldn&#39;t be done
    anymore, too. <BR> <BR>Save your images as an old, old Illustrator EPR &#40;3.0/3.2&#41;,
    and then import that EPS into FOG. Remember to include bounding boxes to keep
    sizes consistent!

  body: 'Copying and pasting from Illustrator CS works fine with FontLab 4.6 and MacOSX.
    If it&#39;s not working, you need to check the preferences in Illustrator CS.  <BR>
    <BR>Select &#34;Illustrator CS &#62; Preferences &#62; File Handling &amp; Clipboard...&#34;
    . Make sure &#34;AICB &#40;no transparency support&#41;&#34; and &#34;Perserve
    Paths&#34; are enabled. Now it should work as it did before for you. &#40;Note:
    AICB is disabled by default when you first install Illustrator CS.&#41;'

  body: hi. i&#39;m having the same problem... can&#39;t paste from illus.cs to fontographer.
    i&#39;ve tryed saving in older .eps formats, tried option copy with aicb. when
    importing i get a &#34;syntax error&#34; and the copy/paste thing just gives me
    a useless greyed out blob. i remember this working before, presumably on an older
    version of illus. i tried importing those files just for kicks and it worked.
    so what gives? anyone that&#39;s done this successfully, please lend a word or
    two...

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure that the latest version of Illustrator that will work
    for copying and pasting with Fontographer is Illustrator 8. Later versions &#40;9,
    10, CS&#41; don&#39;t, regardless of the clipboard preference setting. I never
    used the EPS import feature, but it appears to be the same story.

  body: Saw this post just now. <BR>The problem with Macromedia&#39;s Fontographer
    is thay it&#39;s so old it can only import .eps files that are level 1. Since
    all the latest versions of Illustrator only convert to level 2 or 3, you need
    a workaround. <BR> <BR>Copy your path from Illustrator to Photoshop and export
    as Illustrator path. This Photoshop export is apparently Level 1 because I can
    import these .eps files without a problem. <BR> <BR>Hopefully this works for you.
