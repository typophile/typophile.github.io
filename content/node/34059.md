    Studio fails to interpret the code for it. But of course kerning is in there.
    \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio can decompile some binary OpenType Layout tables into the
    source Adobe FDK for OpenType notation, but this is by no means obvious and does
    not work for all kinds of lookup types and feature configurations. \r\n\r\nOnce
    Adobe releases FDK for OpenType version 3 (or 2.5, or whatever they choose to
    call it) that supports all lookup types, we will rewrite the FontLab Studio part
    so that it is able to \"dump\" the binary OTL code into the AFDKO notation more
    fully. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

    guess that effectively, yes, it is for now due to the limitations of FontLab,
    however i don't think that the features were intentionally designed for this reason.
    if i'm not mistaken, the most current build of [[AFDKO]] supports more complex
    GPOS lookup types (things like being able to kern triplets) and the current build
    of FLab has not been updated to handle these types of things since the new AFDKO
    came out. (somebody please correct me if this information is incorrect)"

    against what? Are you trying to start some sort of conspiracy theory?\r\n\r\nThere's
    nothing mysterious, custom or secret about Arno Pro's 'kern' feature other than
    its complexity is proportional to the size of the font's glyph set. FWIW, the
    AFDKO version we used for building the fonts is the exact same one that is made
    publicly available, and AFAIK all the fonts that come out of MakeOTF follow the
    OpenType specification closely.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything extraordinary to say
    about Arno Pro's 'kern' feature is that it's big \u2014 read huge \u2014, and
    uses a GPOS Extension lookup type.\r\n\r\nBut that's not the point. David started
    this thread saying that he bought Arno Pro Regular, and the font has no kerning
    when using it with CS2 apps (InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop). Needless to say
    I'm still waiting to see some evidence of that."

    be nice. :-)  Mostly it's just the way my brain works.\r\n\r\nBut you know of
    course that it's not just me. Some people think for example that the OT format
    was invented to un-democratize type design. Now, I'm all for demoting democracy,
    but most of all being a practical person I'm interested in the effects of OT on
    the ground - and I like it! Sometimes corporations get it right in spite of themselves.
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nWe might shed some light on this by doing things like comparing Arno's
    kerning to that of something like Garamond Premier Pro. Is the kerning better
    and/or are there more characters/glyphs to kern?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Glyphs doesn't do the job either. After compressing kerning and trying to export,

    compile everything into .otf format? I need to ship 10 styles of Arno so this
    might be the best bet, otherwise it looks like I'll have to get my hands dirty
    with FDK.

  body: FontForge does not preserve the naming table. So you need at least to extract
    the naming table from the Adobe font and then merge it into the resulting file;
    I do that with TTX. Aside from that I think FontForge does not scrap Adobe fonts
    (I have bundled i.e. old version, either CS3 or Adobe Type Classics). Anyway,
    if FontForge has a problem with a table, it emits a warning message. I have always
    found a way out with TTX; I have never tried  the FontForge feature "Fontfile
    &gt; Preferences &gt; Open Font &gt; Preserve tables" that might also help for
    tables FontForge does not know. But, frankly, if I only modified the GPOS table,
    I take it from the resulting .otf font produced by FontForge and merge it into
    the original with TTX. That way, everything else is preserved.

  body: "I did a quick test and was able to extract a feature file from Arno Pro with
    DTL OTMaster, open the original font in FontLab, make an FDK build structure in
    a folder (I have a script that does this for the current font in FontLab), then
    try to build the font on the command line with makeotf.\r\n\r\nOn the first try
    it failed with the same message as Glyphs (GPOS feature 'kern' causes overflow
    of offset to a subtable), but after adding \"UseExtension\" to the kerning lookup
    in the feature file, the font can be built with makeotf. I haven't done any checks
    if the font is identical to the original, though.\r\n\r\nBTW. In Glyphs, you can
    find a FDK build structure in your home folder in <code>Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Temp/\u2039font
    name\u203A</code>. Perhaps you can add the \"UseExtension\" lookup flag in the
    'features' file there and compile with makeotf from there."
