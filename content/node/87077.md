body: "A text font in the Janson / Ehrhardt mode, but with many contemporary details
  and conveniences. \r\n\r\nhttp://equityfont.com\r\n\r\nA snazzy PDF specimen is
  here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typo.la/eqts\r\n\r\nThe basic family includes 6 styles: regular,
  italic, bold, bold italic, regular small caps, and bold small caps. All 6 styles
  are provided in two weight grades (the default grade + a lighter grade for office
  printers that add weight)\r\n\r\nThe standard license allows PDF embedding, @font-face
  embedding, and editable embedding (e.g., in word-processing documents).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/equity_3871.gif]"

  body: I do not understand much of legal jargon, but the type looks readable enough
    on the sample above. Wonder, though, if a slightly-expanded 'caption' style would
    be of the good for the  smaller type, like the notice at the top. Oh, well...
    tomorrow is also a day.
