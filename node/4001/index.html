  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"> Ok, I had this problem with FL3 and now it&#39;s back again with FL4. I&#39;m running OS X. In Fog4, when you&#39;re flipping through glyphs, the left side-bearing stays put. This is a good way of judging the relative positions of different characters without drawing a bunch of guides. <BR> <BR>In FL3, and again in FL4, I flip through the glyphs, and each glyph gets centered in the glyph window. This is good/bad. However, I&#39;ve noticed that &#42;sometimes&#42; the left side-bearing does stay put between glyphs! I noticed that there is a tiny lock icon in the ruler at the top of the side-bearings and at the end of the baseline. Does this have something to do with it? <BR> <BR>I emailed Pyrus, haven&#39;t gotten an answer yet. I know, I know, rtfm. I did &#40;skimmed really fast looking for screenshots of that little lock&#41;. Anyone have any ideas? &#40;now preparing to feel really stupid&#41; </div>

I especially like the fact that you&#39;re included &#34;hybrid&#34; figures and multiple sizes of caps &#40;except maybe 3 sizes is enough - few people even notice this stuff anyway&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.m-real.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.m-real.com/</A> <BR>  It&#39;s square &#40;which is nice&#41;, and printed on too-fancy paper &#40;not nice&#41;, and the previous issue was called &#34;Black and White&#34; - right up my alley.
