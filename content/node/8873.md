  body: Hamburgefons shows off the variety of elements in a typeface. Proportion and
    angle of diagonal and curved strokes; x-height, extender lengths; relative widths,
    etc. <BR> <BR>But a generative methodology can be quite different. I often start
    with lowercase a, e, o, and n. The a and e determine a lot of the personality
    of a typeface relative to other faces, while the relationship between o and n
    is a proportional benchmark for the whole alphabet.

    use of the word Modernism. You were right to critisize and defend then. But this
    just sound petty. <BR> <BR>I did not see Hrant make any big deal out of the diagram
    - he just posted it and I responded saying it was interesitng. I was also looking
    at it after midnight, so I told Hrant I wanted to look at it more some other time.
    <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the big deal? Who cares how people have been designing faces
    for centuries? They also relieved themselves outdoors for centuries. Living in
    the north east US, i am glad that I do not have to be limited to the way it has
    been done for centuries. <BR> <BR>&#39;nuff said.

  body: 'Mike, Hrant wrote: <i>any text face does need to consider this type of analysis,</i>
    and I think that sort of claim needs to be considered. I really think Hrant&#39;s
    diagram represents a deliberate complication of something very simple and obvious,
    in order to make his &#39;insights&#39; seem esoteric or even radical. And then
    he insists that text type design requires this kind of &#39;analysis&#39;. Well
    I&#39;ve analysed his diagram, and while it looks very pretty, all it shows is
    that letters of our alphabet share some features. So what? Any child learning
    to write gets that in the first week. In what way is this sort of complicated
    diagram <i>necessary</i> to text typeface design? Hrant has made the claim, but
    what does it mean? What is the implication for type design practice that Hrant
    has drawn a line between an <i>a</i> and an <i>e,</i> or between an <i>f</i> and
    a <i>t?</i> Is there in fact any implication at all? I think these are valid challenges
    when someone puts forward an elaborate diagram and claims that it represents necessary
    analysis. <BR> <BR>I did not say that you should be limited to the way things
    have been done for centuries. But Hrant, by saying that this kind of analysis
    is <i>needed</i> is certainly imposing limits on what constitutes text typeface
    design, and anyone who doesn&#39;t employ such analysis is doing it wrong. So
    I ask: what is the analysis? To me, despite the attractiveness of the diagram,
    the analysis is incredibly shallow: yes, letters share common features. So what?
    This is neither a mystery nor an insight. I&#39;m all in favour of type designers
    being analytical. But let&#39;s be analytical about claims to analysis also. Analyse
    the analysis, and don&#39;t be taken in by the attractiveness of the diagram.'

    analysis that needs to be considered <BR>&#62; in designing a text face? <BR>
    <BR>Because information comes from contrast, and because a text face is a little
    machine that&#39;s supposed to faciliate reading, some formal analysis &#40;if
    only as a tool and not an end&#41; of alphabetic structures can only help. You

    anything that you can&#39;t get in a few seconds <BR> <BR>Then I must have an
    IQ in the teens, since that diagrams took me many weeks of thought. <BR>Or I&#39;m
    a snake-oil salesman, like you seem to be saying. <BR> <BR>&#62; the diagram complicates
    the simple information it seeks to convey. <BR> <BR>Well, I don&#39;t know what
    &#34;simple&#34; means here I guess. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so simple that
    you don&#39;t need a diagram. And this particular diagram actually has two layers
    of information: direct letterwise similarities &#40;which pertains to deliberative
    legibility - think Larson&#41;, and bouma-componental similarities &#40;pertaining
    to immersive reading - see my article in the imminent TYPO #13&#41;. A decent
    grasp of either of those -especially the latter- can&#39;t come from merely looking
    at the alphabet over a sandwich. And in what font? The conclusions &#40;both casual
    and empirical&#41; certainly depend on what you&#39;re looking at, Quadraat or
    Courier. You look at the chirographic structures underlying the forms? That would
    naturally limit your insight into <i>reading</i>, thus your ability to benefit
    from progress in that realm. <BR> <BR>And actually, I think it&#39;s one of the
    few times I&#39;ve designed a good composition - it presents the tangle of relationships
    in a clear and pleasing manner. Like how the &#34;cells&#34; are amorphous&#42;
    I think helps. In fact I remember how after my talk at ATypI-Boston, Lawrence
    Mirsky of the Cooper Union asked me for a copy of the diagram; but when I asked
    him if he also wanted the sheet with the MasLucida structures, he politely declined.
    My tentative conclusion was: here&#39;s an accomplished designer who didn&#39;t
    like my end-results, but nonetheless thought that diagram was worth keeping. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Not very Modernist, I apologize... <BR> <BR>The one thing I wonder about
    though is the density difference, like how the bottom-right has more stuff. Would
    it be better to have an even gray, or is this skew in fact conducive to better
    understanding? Sort of like how Hangul has syllables of 4 different densities,
    and that helps reading. <BR> <BR>And yes, people have been designing fonts for
    centuries, but: <BR>1&#41; We don&#39;t know what people like Fleischman for example
    &#40;a genius who put a jaw-dropping degree of divergence in some of his designs&#41;
    did to &#34;formalize&#34; their efforts. We&#39;ve lost track of the scaling
    data used by the Bentons less than a century ago - one wonders what else has been
    lost from giants like Granjon. <BR>2&#41; Let&#39;s not discourage people from
    improving the craft, just because it might reveal limitations in past thought.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; imposing limits on what constitutes text typeface design <BR> <BR>I
    think it&#39;s important to differentiate between &#34;real&#34; text face design
    that contributes to culture, and imitative text face design that pleases the creator
    and the market, but keeps us shackled to the past. Parroting the past is what&#39;s
    shallow - it&#39;s a fear of change, of losing one&#39;s comfortable supremacy.

    made that groups letters according to their structual relationships&#39;, I wouldn&#39;t
    have bothered to say anything. But when you say &#39;any text face does need to
    consider this type of analysis&#39; you make two claims: a&#41; that the diagram
    represents analysis, and b&#41; that this analysis is <i>necessary</i> to text
    typeface design. I question the first of these claims because something that documents
    the obvious isn&#39;t much of an analysis, no matter how carefully done or how
    long it takes you. And I question the second claim because it is clearly not the
    case; at most you can say that some text typeface design might benefit from such
    analysis, or perhaps consideration is a better word. And I don&#39;t accept your
    distinction between &#39;real&#39; type design and what the majority of type designers
    do. Type design <i>is</i> what type designers do, and whatever they do. Your category
    of &#39;real&#39; type design reminds me of the kind of perfect capitalism espoused

    as a sound basis for design. <BR> <BR>? <BR>I think you want to put me -and probably
    everything else- in a neat box, and this is leading you to such incorrect statements.
    <BR> <BR>I separate &#34;pure&#34; ideology &#40;without which there is no culture&#41;
    from actual design effort &#40;without which there&#39;s no humanity&#41;. And
    I&#39;m not interested in imposing Right and condemning Wrong in the realm of
    <i>action</i> because we&#39;re all fallible human beings. But I&#39;m certainly
    interested in helping myself and others follow paths that are more conducive to
    cultural and functional progress in type design. Chirography for example is an
    ideology that is regressive; this doesn&#39;t mean for example that the Underware
    boys should be burned at the stake; but it does mean that their wasting of potential
    makes me sad, and I can&#39;t just shut up about it. That&#39;s all. <BR> <BR>The
    &#34;a&#34; business is actually a superb angle. Glad to hear about the genesis
    of Constantia&#39;s. When I first saw it it actually crossed my mind that I might
    have had an influence on it, but it seemed like a long shot - after all many existing
    fonts &#40;not to mention entire genres of handwriting&#41; have done that for
    ages. The thing is, I have to think that virtually all of those opted not to have
    the terminal based on an incorrect ideology. Sure, the results are the same in
    that case, but a faulty foundation will get you in the end. Like how Ruse <i>does</i>
    have a terminal; that&#39;s just weak apologetics - trying to cover up chirography
    by giving it a strap-on dildo or something! Perhaps the best example here is Arnhem:
    its &#34;a&#34; is missing the terminal in the display cut but has it in the text!
    Talk about one confused cat. <BR> <BR>The reason a weak-top &#34;a&#34; is better
    for reading is related to bouma divergence. There&#39;s really no two ways about
    it. But this certainly does not mean every text font must have that feature and
    text fonts without that feature must be verboten! All it means is this: know as
    a designer, or a user, that this reduces readability. That&#39;s all. My Patria
    for example has some glyphs that are a bit too wide for -what I consider to be-
    optimal readability. This was a conscious decision, to strike a certain balance
    of aesthetics and function. <i>That</i> is design; but it certainly doesn&#39;t
    preclude ideology. <BR> <BR>BTW, just to clarify: <BR>1&#41; I never said <i>that
    particular</i> diagram should be the <i>total</i> basis for any text face. What
    I said was much broader and gentler: that formal structural analysis -with is
    certainly aided by such diagrams- is a boon for any text face design effort that
    aims to improve reading. And what is Craft without the desire for improvement?
    <BR>2&#41; That diagram isn&#39;t based just on my observation and introspection;
    as I point out in &#34;Improving the Tool&#34; it&#39;s also based partly on empirical
    findings, like those of Ovink, Bouma and Spencer. And it takes a <i>little</i>
    more than 2 minutes to read and analyze all their work... <BR> <BR>hhp'

    exploration of typeface design.   <BR> <BR>Even if it does look pretty, the diagram
    is still quite hard to read as a piece of information design and would benefit
    from removing the amoeba outlines. Even on the Spanish color version there is
    no need for presenting the overlapping sets, as there is already an implied relationship
    between the letterforms by their location. Having each letter placed next to another
    and then linked with thick and thin lines is enough to show the various connections.
    Having the additional sets, especially on the black and white version, just adds
    noise and makes the diagram hard to read for general non-academic use.

    a train out of Leipzig in 2000. The thing is, I so badly want to be a good dancer
    &#40;and Tango would be a dream choice&#41;, but it&#39;s really quite beyond
    doubt: I suck. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Guillaume, analysing something that seems obvious, or which is taken for granted,
    and so revealing things about it that are not obvious, is clearly worthwhile.
    But that is something quite different from &#39;analysis&#39; that itself only
    documents what is obvious. My point about Hrant&#39;s diagram is that it doesn&#39;t
    tell you anything new that isn&#39;t obvious from looking at the alphabet arranged
    any other way. It simply restates the obvious in a different and, to my mind,
    unnecessarily complex way. <BR> <BR>There is an important difference between,
    as I wrote, &#39;something that documents the obvious&#39; and something that,
    if you like, &#39;deconstructs&#39; the obvious. The latter involves analysis.
    The former is just repackaging.

    it at each other, he has an unnerving knack of making a comment that reminds me
    that I actually have some things in common with him. Now it seems we have a shared

  body: John, I don&#39;t understand how it &#40;especially the Modules component
    of my diagram&#41; can be so &#34;obvious&#34; -at least to you, presumably- when
    you don&#39;t even believe in boumas. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: But the idea of &#39;modules&#39;, in your words groupings of letters into
    colour sets, which represent the components of letters that contribute ambiguity
    to boumas&#39;, is an imposition on top of the obvious data. What the diagram
    shows is simply the obvious fact that some letters have a modular relationship
    to other letters. You take it for granted that modularity leads to ambiguity,
    and so impose this interpretation on the data, but every letter that has a modular
    relationship to another letter also has a disambiguating feature. Many writing
    systems work this way &#40;Arabic probably has the most modularity of any alphabetic
    system&#41;, and I&#39;ve not seen any indication that scripts with less modularity,
    e.g. Greek, are read with greater speed or accuracy. [This is something that could
    be measured without most of the usual concerns regarding reading speed tests,
    since what one would be interested in is relative speed in the same conditions,
    not absolute speed in preferred conditions. I wonder if we can interest Kevin?]

  body: 'Further thought: your alphabet reform ideas, at least around the time that
    you presented this diagram at ATypI in Boston, are based on the idea that disambiguation
    needs to be maximised by reducing modularity. But there is strong experiential
    and anecdotal evidence, based on the daily reading experience of hundreds of millions
    of people, that what matters is <i>sufficient</i> disambiguation.'

  body: '&#62; an imposition on top of the obvious data. <BR> <BR>Nope. Look at it
    more carefully. <BR>So not so obvious, I&#39;d say... <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, the colors
    in the Spanish PDF aren&#39;t mine.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;ve not seen any
    indication that scripts <BR>&#62; with less modularity, e.g. Greek, are read <BR>&#62;
    with greater speed or accuracy <BR> <BR>That&#39;s only because empirical testing
    has been so half-baked [so far]. It basically hasn&#39;t managed to prove or disprove
    <i>anything</i> of value, even just within Latin. <BR> <BR>BTW, Greek also has
    an even larger x-height than Latin &#40;when you look at linguistic letter frequency&#41;
    and that&#39;s a readability drawback. As for Arabic, yes it&#39;s modular, but
    its extenders are gloriously rich. So it&#39;s not just a matter of modularity,
    certainly, but divergence is still a key to optimal information delivery. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; .... what matters is sufficient disambiguation <BR> <BR>1&#41; You have
    even less evidence for your views than I do for mine. <BR>2&#41; To clarify &#40;and
    even in Boston I was saying that &#34;flying under the radar of the reader&#34;
    is critical&#41; I think what matters is pushing the limits of divergence <i>without
    breaking immersion</i>. This precludes for example having a mish-mash of glyphs
    of different styles; but it doesn&#39;t preclude making the top of the &#34;a&#34;
    weak for example. That&#39;s why there&#39;s such a thing a too-even-color font,
    and why constructed fonts have lesser readability than &#34;organic&#34; ones.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Sufficient disambiguation&#34; is only relevant in the conscious/deliberative
    realm, and there you only need the tiniest bit of divergence to ensure leisurely
    letterwise decipherment. But in the quick, fuzzy realm of immersive reading, every
    detail matters - nothing is &#34;sufficient&#34;, it&#39;s all just better or
    worse - as long as it&#39;s not so bad as to preclude immersion outright. <BR>
