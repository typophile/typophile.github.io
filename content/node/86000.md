body: "Hi all,\r\n \r\nI'm working on some pretty blocky type and its angle cut off
  points (ege the first angle of a 2 is sliced) are around 45 degrees, now I was thinking
  it would be cool if I could automatically generate these angled lines at different
  angles, eg from 30degrees through to 55degrees and then I could pick and choose
  the one I like.\r\n \r\nJust wondering if anyone knows a way I could do this using
  specific software, via an action in illustrator or something maybe?\r\n \r\nAny
  help, ideas would be great"

  body: You could draw two glyphs in Illustrator, one with an angle of 30 degrees,
    and the other with an angle of 55. Then, with the blend tool, interpolate. Double
    clicking the blend tool icon gives you more options like setting the number of
    steps. Make sure you have an equal number of anchor points though.

  body: You could script all this in Robofab pretty easily, but what Jean Paul suggested
    would probably be a lot faster and easier.

title: Creating a basic blocky font, is there a way I can see it's slice angles in
  a series of different angles easily?
