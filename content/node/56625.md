    nice options.  Even though the article said that Gill Sans was over-used and suggested
    looking at FF Milo and Agenda, my vote stays with Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nmgk"

    here in this list of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/alternatives/\">alternatives</a>.\r\n\r\nBut
    to bogdan's question \u2014 there are hundreds of legible typefaces, the more
    important approach is to find those that are most important for your project.
    So what are you working on?"

    Milo or FF Kievit would be a much better choice. I've used them both for long
    stretches of text, and they perform beautifully."

  body: "I have occasionally wondered why is there no Gill Sans weight between Regular
    and Light, a book weight.\r\nHowever, I have a few books from the 1930s with the
    text set entirely in the Regular, e.g. <em>The Modern House</em>, by F.R.S. Yorke.
    I have some 1930s Meccano manuals set in Gill Sans Light, very nice.\r\n\r\nBut
    really, this is not even a question, as most typefaces are highly legible when
    set correctly.\r\nPerhaps what you seek is a font that will forgive inept typography?"

  body: "I think <a href=\"http://www.clearviewhwy.com/\">ClearviewHwy</a> has a lot
    of potential for use with the visually impaired. A lot of actual empirical research
    went into improving legibility under harsh conditions (nighttime, halo effects
    from weather, etc.) and I suspect these conditions aren't that different from
    what some visually impaired people experience.\r\n\r\nI'm not blown away by APHont,
    and suspect that most similar large-aperture sans fonts (for example, Vera Sans,
    which it resembles) will perform similarly. I'm also skeptical of the low x-height
    - I think that vertical space could be put to better use making the font larger,
    which is probably the single most important thing to do for low-vision readers.
    Clearview maxes this out, and, as I said, is based on actual empirical evaluation.
    I also recommend a slightly heavier weight than typical Book, as that should help
    improve perceived contrast as well.\r\n\r\nFor a serif font, I might suggest one
    of the Century family (Schoolbook is something of a cliche for this niche), or
    Nick Shinn's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/worldwide/\">Worldwide</a>,
    for a more modern update.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n"

  body: "<em>... vision/visual impairment.</em>\r\n\r\nAs Raph says, make it larger.\r\n\r\nWe've
    had threads on this before, and the consensus seems to be that there is a range
    of reading impairments and next to no empirical testing on what works generally.
    So someone without a track record in type design can come up with a theory of
    what makes a good typeface for those with difficulties, design a typeface accordingly
    that looks like nothing special at best, and hype it as The Answer, without testing
    it head-to-head against any other face.\r\n\r\nI would say approach this as a
    rigorously demanding design job--target your market as accurately as possible
    and test your layout in focus groups. Indeed, that's what James Montalbano did
    with Clearview. The design project there was not a typeface for those with reading
    difficulties, but highway signage with custom type. Why would one assume that
    a typeface designed for normally sighted people to read one or two words glimpsed
    moving at  a distance (small arc of vision) would also be best for the visually
    impaired to read text? Isn't that making rather a lot of assumptions about how
    they read? Wouldn't it be more likely that they read in a quite different manner,
    perhaps slowly and examining each letter carefully and closely? And in that case,
    might not some other kind of typeface work better? How would one know unless one
    tested a variety? Who has done this? No one! In fact, organizations such as the
    CNIB can't even say whether serif or sans serif is better.\r\n\r\nI believe that
    layout is as important as typeface, and that testing a variety of layouts (vary
    size, typeface, leading, line length, etc.) with actual readers is the best way
    to find what works. \r\n\r\nWith regards to Gill Sans: there is an alternate version
    with a single storey \"a\" and \"g\", but has anyone ever tested to see if it
    works better for those with reading difficulty? It could be argued that both versions
    are better--the usual version because it has more distinctive and unique letter
    forms, the alternate because it doesn't have complex and bewildering shapes. These
    arguments are bullshit, in the strict Frankfurt sense--pleasantry that is neither
    true nor false, because it has never been put to the test. And if that is the
    case with something as drastically different as these Gill Sans alternate letters,
    how can one make any convincing statement about typeface legibility from theory
    alone, without the test results to back it up? "
