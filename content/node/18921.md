body: I need a suggestion - and it may sound idiotic. What is the best kerning for
  a De pair? Because of the opposing curves it always feels too far apart when compared
  with the other letters (the entire word is Delta). I will be using a San-Serif which
  seems to compound the problem. Any suggestions fro a good sanserif typeface that
  will work? (Oddly enough I don't like the overall feel of the font Delta). Again
  I know this is a slightly ignorant question, but I am having a little trouble trusting
  my instincts on this one.

    font and context. \r\n\r\nAs for suggesting fonts - further and better particulars
    required. Haven't looked at Delta, but choosing a font by name is not really going
    to help you get anywhere. The audience doesn't know or care what the font is called."

    verticals are more likely to be straighter than rounder) with a large x-height
    (so e doesn't tuck under the D) like\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/trade-gothic/\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Ha ha ha - very funny - good suggestion Tim. I may end up going with an all
    lowercase. I just wanted to know if there were any good suggestions for making
    those two competing arcs not fight so much visually. As far as choosing a font
    by its name - I realize that isn't a methodology for choosing a typeface - just
    commenting on how the D-e pair looks ironically horrible - would think they would
    have given it a better name to show off the face.
