body: I am restoring my son&#39;s 1980&#39;s BMX bicycle and need to replace the old
  headtube decal and frame and fork graphics. Three fonts are used but I don&#39;t
  know what they are. Any help?

  body: Patrick, if the bicycle company is still in business contact them directly
    they probably have the decals already made up and could send them to you. Its
    a pretty common thing to do.

  body: More info on JMC. JMC went out of business in the mid 80&#39;s and parts and
    decals are very rare. But if you follow the link below, maybe you can identify
    some fonts from the bikes and accesories from this collectors site. <a href="http://www.jmcracing.net"

    an expert at this stuff, so there&#39;s probably someone else with better advice.

    3</a> <BR> <BR>You asked for 3 fonts, so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the &#34;JMC&#34;
    in the shield logo from picture 2, the blocky &#34;JMC&#34; from picture 1 and
    the &#34;racing&#34; script from picture 1. Based on the above, I would say: <BR>
    <BR>1. The shield logo is most likely hand drawn. Similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/copperplate-gothic/bold-condensed/">Copperplate
    Gothic Bold Condensed</a>. <BR> <BR>2. &#34;JMC&#34; seems to be in the same font
    as &#34;California&#40;?&#41; Racing Designs&#34; on the package in picture 3.
    <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000008">Sneakers</a>
    is pretty close, but there may be a better match. <BR> <BR>3. The &#34;racing&#34;
    script may also be hand-drawn. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/debonair-jf/debonair-jf/testdrive.html?s=racing&amp;p=72">Debonair
    JF</a> comes close, but it will need a lot of tweaking. Maybe someone else knows
    the right one. <BR> <BR>Note, the fonts used in the headline of the website are
    not the same as any of the fonts that appear in the images. <BR> <BR> - Lex'
