body: "Enjoy non-suicidal letter shape on your mobile / cellphone.  Why use a \r\nsuicidal
  shape k/K on the 11th english language letter, see: \r\nhttp://Kalphabet.googlepages.com,
  when you could use a non-suicidal \r\nletter shape alternative i.e. \u0915/\u0915
  in lower and upper cases?  [choose \r\nUTF-8 on your internet browser\u2019s character
  encoding if you are unable \r\nto see the new shape] \r\n\r\nThat is exactly what
  I did by using Symbian S60 v5 operating system \r\nmobile / cellphone.  I had been
  searching for an easy font alteration \r\non the mobile / cellphone in Britain.
  \ I had searched Android \r\noperating system phones and there was either (1) rooting
  the phone \r\nwhich required some technical ability and also involved some ris\u0915s
  or \r\n(2) contracting or buying the expensive Samsung Galaxy S range or a \r\nfew
  other Samsung models which has the font alteration capability. \r\nThere was something
  also technical with option (2) as the Samsung \r\nmobiles / cellphones used Google
  Play / Android mar\u0915et and this \r\ninvolved certain technical abilities because
  I could not simply upload \r\na .ttf font from the PC. \r\n\r\nThus I opted for
  a much easier solution and this was purchasing a \r\ncheap Symbian S60 v5 operating
  system mobile / cellphone when I learnt \r\nthat alternating the font was easy and
  could be done by a newbie.  The \r\nmobile / cellphone for font alteration mentioned
  were:  No\u0915ia 5800, \r\n5233, 5230 and 5235.  I only had to copy 4 times on
  the PC my chosen \r\nfont containing the non-suicidal letter, i.e. the BBT font
  ( download \r\nit for example from here http://www.archive.org/details/BbtFont -
  \r\nchoose Regular or Italic )  and then only change each file name to \r\n(note
  lower case / upper case file name letters) s60snr.ttf, \r\ns60ssb.ttf, s60tsb.ttf
  and S60ZDIGI.ttf. \r\n\r\nThen I either had to: \r\n(1) on a Memory Card create
  'Resource' named folder and in it the \r\n'Fonts' named folder and put the s60snr.ttf,
  s60ssb.ttf, s60tsb.ttf \r\nand S60ZDIGI.ttf files there - restart the phone. \r\n\r\nor
  \r\n\r\n(2)  connect the mobile / cellphone to the PC in Mass Storage Mode, \r\nsearch
  for the 'Resource' named folder in the internal mobile / \r\ncellphone file system
  and in it the 'Fonts' named folder and if there \r\nwas not one there - create the
  'Fonts' folder.  Transfer the \r\ns60snr.ttf, s60ssb.ttf, s60tsb.ttf and S60ZDIGI.ttf
  to the 'Fonts' \r\nnamed folder.  Restart the mobile / cellphone. \r\n\r\nI chose
  this method (1).  I found the process easy and really prefer \r\nthe non-suicidal
  letter shape on the mobile / cellphone.  The only \r\nthing that I as a newbie have
  not been able to do is alter the default \r\nNo\u0915ia image at booting though
  I have put the non-suicidal letter \r\nstic\u0915er (see post mentioning stic\u0915erboo\u0915)
  on the No\u0915ia name which is \r\non the phone case front and put blan\u0915 stic\u0915ers
  on the No\u0915ia name which \r\nis on the reverse and on the battery due to larger
  size stic\u0915er \r\nunavailability and also it was convenient. \r\n\r\n2 Pictures

    behind this had gone away or given up or taken his quest to another forum.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I don't think we'll ever modify our alphabet in this way - because the rationale
    is simply unpersuasive to that great majority of Latin alphabet users who are
    not of the Hindu faith - I could see how the goal might be achieved through a
    more subtle approach.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Armenian alphabet has no \"suicidal\"
    shapes of this type in it. And it has room - used in Eastern Armenian - for the
    extra consonant sounds found in Chinese (particularly in the Shanghai dialect,
    where English b, d, and g are also present)... and in Sanskrit. So this alphabet
    could be recommended on the more apparently rational grounds of promoting global
    unity and world peace.\r\n\r\nIf we can't all speak the same language, at least
    we can share the same typewriters."

    and after many months of consultation and contemplation settled on Armenian as
    the best possible choice. Unfortunately things went south when the Chinese government
    requested that Armenia promptly send 15 million teachers.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    movement as an individual because he lacked confidence in its new leadership after
    the death of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.\r\n\r\nThe
    Hare Krishna movement, or ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness)
    is, basically, a denomination of Hinduism or a faith organization within that
    religion. (I had a binaural test record that referred to them as \"Buddhists\",
    so apparently some confusion about Eastern religions exists.)\r\n\r\nOn his web
    page, he explains that an ancient battle between Gods and demons took place at
    the junction of several rivers; and that this event was so significant that the
    shape of that junction of rivers provokes suicidal thoughts in people. This involves
    an invisible river, called the Saraswati, but apparently the tradition of people
    in India committing suicide at a place of pilgrimage in Allahabad was real enough."

    suicidal shape is <em>invisible.</em> We could perhaps ease Javascript's concerns
    by saying that the letter K is actually made up of four strokes, one of which
    is invisible, so its visible shape is not representative of its true shape, and
    hence its true (non-suicidal) meaning.\r\n\r\nHrant, did you take money for that
    job?\r\n\r\nBTW, if you enjoy this, don't miss <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/99378\">this</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    find it alternatively delightfully imaginative and depressingly stupid that all
    this time after the development of philology, palaeography and systematic linguistics
    people are still inclined to assign <em>magical</em> significance to the mundane
    phenomena of of writing. Writing is wonderful, but because it is made by this
    animal called human, not because it reveals occult knowledge or works as sympathetic
    magic on the psyche."

    during his lifetime, I can only conclude he made that request shortly before his
    passing.\r\n\r\nThis would have a precedent; the Ballards printed the I Am magazine
    with purple ink because they were against the colors black and red. Summit University,
    on the other hand, has no such scruple."
