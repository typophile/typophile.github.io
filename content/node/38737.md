  a new logo for our company and, even I like it, I have little doubts, mostly abot
  the first \"e\".\r\n\r\nI would apreciatte any kind of critique and opinions on
  it.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.eragin.com/txo/logo_eragin2.jpg|the logo]]\r\n\r\nI actually
  tried some diferente \"e\" and finnaly that's the one... here some that I tried
  with (the first is the one I used finally): [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_versions_3506.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
  idea was to create a especific type for this logo, not two complicated, readable
  (is this word ok in english?) and kind of contemporary... or something :P\r\n\r\nWe
  use the type inside this rounded black square as a base, and them put some draw
  or imagotype behind, change colour or texture depending on when and where we are
  using it... it's a very dinamic logo... but that's another story...\r\n\r\nhow about
  this type?\r\n\r\nthanks to all\r\n\r\n"

  body: You use the word "contemporary", be careful that this does not become dated!
    I would say...fonts like these tend to date very quickly. I would not use them
    personally. Also think about what you are telling the reader, do you need to tell
    them you are a ".com" business or can they find that out themselves easily?

  body: "The e is the least of your concerns. I see a big pool of white in the g that
    is very distracting, and the m is driving me nuts because it looks like it's about
    2/3 the size that it should be, especially when compared to the n. Look at it
    both upside-down and very small to get a better sense of how well the positive
    and negative spaces are balanced and how the characters relate to each other.\r\n"

  body: "hi\r\nit's true what you say rydere about contemporary and the dated staff...
    actually I've been thinking quite a lot about that and make my/our decision on
    that. Actually we have quite clear this staff about \"modern\" design becoming
    dated and do so on our designs. \r\nActually I ask you people because I wanted
    to do a balance logo cause a well done \"contemporary\" design use to be less
    dated. \r\nAbout the .com staff: we allready spent 6 years with this brand (sometimes
    with .com sometimes not) and after asking once and again to ourselves this what
    you are saying (involving all that staff with the dot com companys etc etc) we
    decided that in the limits that we move, the clients we have and so on... the
    .com defines quite a lot our company (works we do, way we work) and decide to
    leave there on the brand.\r\n(right now we're making our new brand site, there
    is a very old site there at eragin.com, but at the moment we'll start using this
    logo hardly, there'll be a quite powerfull site, I guess). I really apreciatte
    what you say, cause I think they are very important staff even this time (wrong
    or not) they're allready decided.\r\n\r\nKoppa: uh.. your right about the g...
    I'll take a look at this. about the M you're also right, this time it was conscious
    because if I left the M like it should be it was too big (and I say this related
    with the .com staff rydere say) and the .com was taking too many space in the
    logo... uhm... shoddy work? I'll take a look to this also, maybe I'll post some
    of the previous Ms.\r\n\r\nthank you very much folks!"

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI did some corrections about the g and the m.\r\n\r\nthe firs in
    the image is the original one.\r\nthe second is the one I use as \"good\" for
    the moment: I did an m with the right size and cut a little bit from the inner
    part of the tail of the g to make that white mass more light(sorry if I don't
    explai too clear, but I don't realy know the english right words for typo).\r\n\r\nthe
    third one I made the g more straght, maybe more \"right\"... but I think I still
    like the other g, what you think? the m has the first hollow (hole?) a little
    bit bigger..\r\n\r\nat the fourth I tried a diferent g cutting white from the
    outter part of the tail and leaving the inner as it war.. I think I still like
    the second... and tried a diferent m but I guess the other m works better with
    the round rhythm of the other letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eragin_bidean_3541.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nlet
    me know what you think please.\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Like Koppa mentioned the area of white in the g where the counter meets the
    descender is distracting in its weightiness, a little work on the open counter
    might help. Of the m iterations the second of your latest version is an improvement,
    although the transition of curve to vertical on the right isn't quite there yet.
    Overall there is too much overshoot on the characters, exacerbated by there only
    being three which aren't curved top and bottom, the r especially is jumping. Rework
    are the heaviness of the junctions in the e, a, g and, to a lesser extent, n.\r\n\r\nTim"
