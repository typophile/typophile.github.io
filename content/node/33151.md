  body: "One question I have is how you match fonts in photoshop with what you see
    on sites like Font Shop.  A font at 36pts in Font Shop is much larger/wider than
    the same font on my computer in Photoshop at 36pts.  How can I match the size?
    \ My browser, Firefox, is set for Normal text size.  \r\n\r\nI know this is a
    dumb question, but sometimes I buy fonts and they aren't really the right size
    for what I need.  I only need a few weights now at a certain size.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: They may be different versions of the font and that's why you see a difference
    at the same point size. But I'm not sure I understand why it matters. Do you need
    to set the type at a certain point size? Any font can be set at any size.

  body: "I understand about setting the font sizes.  :-)  I think I'm not expressing
    this very well.  I'll try to think of a way to explain it better.  I have a feeling
    it's just a visualization defiency of mine.  Thanks for your suggestions above,
    Stephen.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "I am going with Titling Gothic.  However, choosing between compressed, condensed
    and narrow is where I get confused.  I can't determine from what I see on Font
    Shop or Font Bureau which one will match the text on my web page the closest.
    \ I don't know why this is so hard for me to see but I sometimes have this problem.
    \ The only thing I know to do is buy several weights and see which one is right.
    So I'm getting compressed and condensed light, compressed and condensed regular,
    condensed medium, condensed and normal black.  \r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
