body: "It was kind of surreal, considering the last conference I went to was as a
  Boeing engineer meeting with the Air Force, discussing flight software for the Inertial
  Upper Stage space booster vehicle sometime in late 1998, or early 1999 (before I
  retired). I have to say the atmosphere at TypeCon was completely different. For
  one thing, there were almost no suits or ties. There were no stacks of documents,
  or copies of presentation charts (although I would have loved some of the latter
  for a few of the talks), and more importantly I wasn\u2019t on the Agenda this time.\r\n\r\nThe
  atmosphere of congeniality was pervasive, and I was sure I \u2019knew\u2019 so many
  of the people there, but I had almost no way to recognize them! It was like driving
  through the neighborhood of the \u2019Homes of the Stars\u2019 without the guide
  map. Most of us Typophilers use Icon/Avatar thingies, so I had no idea what most
  people would look like. The name badges they gave us (set tastefully in FF Sanuk)
  had the first names large and last names small, and if you didn\u2019t get almost
  inside someone\u2019s personal space, you didn\u2019t get to learn which Grant (Hutchinson),
  Chris (Lozos), Mark (Simonson), William (Berkson), Dan (Gayle), Stuart (Sandler,
  to whom I owed and paid $10 for postage on some type books he generously sent me),
  James (\u2019jpad\u2019 Puckett), or Tiffany (Wardle) they were, for example (roughly
  in the order that I met them). I also met \u2019Stewf\u2019 Coles and Cheshire Dave,
  thanks to introductions by Chris. I also found and introduced myself to Eben (Sorkin),
  Carl (Crossgrove), Nick Shinn (somehow he got all his name in large letters), Richard
  (Kegler), Rodrigo (Cavazos), Simon (\u2019Sii\u2019 Daniels), and Veronika (Burian,
  the Czech type designer \u2014 of FF Maiola \u2014 because my ancestry (Janiga)
  was from her region). I even (almost) had lunch with Mark Simonson, but his screwed
  up plane reservation cancelled that \u2014 maybe next time, Mark.\r\n\r\nThe talks
  were usually interesting, informative, or funny (usually a combination), and I didn\u2019t
  miss a single one of them over the three days. I started having fantasies about
  giving a talk on Font Identification \u2014 a topic that was never mentioned during
  the conference (a gross oversight, in my opinion) \u2014 discussing Automatic Tools
  (Identifont, WhatTheFont, and others?); Vendor sites with keywords and test samples;
  Font ID Guides (passive and interactive); and of course Expert forums, like the
  Type ID Board and WTF Forum, to mention two of them. I know Font Identification
  is sort of a quiet cousin to the high profile type designers, type distributors,
  and advertising empire stars, who were the mainstays of the presentations (with
  a few type educators added in). However, I see font identifiers as important links
  that connect many font users with distributors, keeping the Font \u2019Ecosystem\u2019
  vital.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Robert Bringhurst (\u201CThe Elements of Typographic
  Style\u201D), who packed the house (literally) for his erudite talk about Quantum
  Physics and Typography (it has to do with \u2019packets\u2019 of information, and
  particles and waves that makes up everything, including type), and non-Latin fonts,
  and who was autographing copies of his book for admiring fans.\r\n\r\nI wandered
  around in the type displays and wrote down the names, designers and foundries of
  new fonts I saw. The examples from Mexico were intriguing, and were touched on in
  the great talk by Gabriel Mart\xEDnez Meave and Leonardo V\xE1zquez Conde about
  the history and current state of Mexican Type. I found an energetic vitality that
  I think can add to the classicism of the dead European designers we see being revived
  over and over.\r\n\r\nMy first TypeCon was an Experience (capital E), and I hope
  to do it again some time. If you were there and I missed you, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s
  strange to be so much a part of a community that you can\u2019t recognize on sight,
  but without something to help ID each other, or a Typophile rallying point, some
  of us will be like ships passing in the night, to use a well-worn clich\xE9.\r\n\r\n-

    should definitely speak about type identification in Buffalo. Submit a proposal
    to Tamye."

    you serious? Do I have the credentials/credibility needed to present a talk on
    Font Identification at TypeCon? I would love to do it, but who the heck am I to
    talk?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
