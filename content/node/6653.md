  body: Looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cooper-black/cooper-black/testdrive.html?s=Bide+%26+Music&amp;p=48">Cooper
    Black</a>, optically slanted and condensed &#40;NOT italic&#41;, and tweaked a
    little bit &#40;outline effects &amp;c.&#41;  <BR> <BR>I think the ampersand is
    from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/candice/candice/testdrive.html?s=%26&amp;p=72">Candice</a>.

  body: Looks like an artificially obliqued <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cooper-black/bold-condensed/testdrive.html?s=Bide%26Musique&amp;p=48">Cooper
    Black Bold Condensed</a> with an alternate ampersand &#40;I don&#39;t know where
    it came from, though&#41;. <BR> <BR>Since you dearly love this font, may I be
    so bold as to point you to its cousin&#39;s <a href="http://www.veer.com/ideas/btt">life
    story</a>?
