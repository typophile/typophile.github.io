body: "I'd like to have a little help on the following problem, thanks a lot!\r\n\r\n1.)
  \  After exporting as OpenType Ps from Fontlab 5.1.2 (mac), my font looks/works
  great in Indesign and Illutrator. No problem. All kerning info is okay. But on the
  same computer (mac osx 10.6.8) in Word: no kerning info(!) AND the characters are
  cut-off on the upper part. (images below)\r\n\r\n2.)   On a Windows computer there's
  a similar problem:\r\n(in Word) No kerning info and the characters are also cut-off.
  This time they're not cut off on the upper part but exactly on the Baseline.\r\n\r\n3.)
  \   In the Windows-typespecimen some characters (for example the A) is cut-off on
  the left side. I guess that has something to do with the fact that the A crossed
  the line in the glyph window. I there any way to retain all the character-info on
  the left side of the line?\r\n\r\n4.)    In the fontbook and Mac typespecimen there's
  no problem at all. \r\n\r\n(I already did update the Kern-feature in the Kerning
  Assistance window.)\r\n\r\nI really don't know how to solve this problem, is there
  anyone with some advice?\r\n"

    me out with the cut-off problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you also know why my Kerning-Info
    does work in illustrator (cs5 on mac) but doesn't work in Word (mac & windows).\r\n\r\nLike
    to hear from you,\r\nThanks,\r\nVincent"
