  of the following site http://www.escola-aberta-rio.com/pt/#\r\ni discovered that
  the font is called Mercator LB Regular, but i couldn' t find any font simillar to
  it in google, only a serifed from linotype that has nothing to do with it...\r\nRadim
  Pesko is one of the teachers of the course of the site so maybe it is a guess...
  \ \r\nAnyone have any idea where do i buy this font? Which Typefoundrie?\r\nThanks
  in advance...\r\n"
