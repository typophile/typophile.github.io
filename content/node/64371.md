  free :)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm quite bored with what's out there and an looking
  for something a bit more \"extravagant.\" It's hard to find something actually special
  as most just look like a dirty version of a popular font...a lot don't seem very
  professional.\r\n\r\nWhat are some grunge oriented fonts that you use and enjoy?
  Are there some paid fonts that are much better/cooler worth buying?"

  body: "Have you tried looking for commercial fonts with the keyword \"grunge\"?
    You didn't give us much idea about general style you want before being grunged.
    \r\n\r\nI think part of the problem may be that usually we use 'grunge' to mean
    a messed up version of something familiar. So maybe 'grunge' isn't really what
    you are looking for. This gets us into very subjective territory, because we don't
    have much to help guess what you'd be interested in.\r\n\r\nCan you describe what
    would fill your bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I'm looking for something grungy but not too extreme or weird. Something
    with a good balance scratched/distressed elements and not over killed with weird
    shapes and curls. I think I want a font that isn't shaped to weird so that I can
    actually use it for a larger portion of text on a flyer or as headings. Most grunge
    fonts seem to be designed to be used sparingly on a cover page or t-shirt...I'm
    looking for something more controlled that would look great with larger amounts
    of text then 1 sentence.\r\n\r\nHope that makes any sense lol\r\n\r\nAlot of the
    ones you guys mentioned I've seen...found a couple new ones to try :) looking
    for some more!!"

    of fonts.\r\nPersonally I love MVB Magnesium Grime, though it probably doesn't
    fit this particular bill.\r\nAlso FF Confidential and FF Stamp Gothic. \r\n"
