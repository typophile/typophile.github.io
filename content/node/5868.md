body: Any advice on optimizming tangents?  &#40;Especially that tricky one on lowercase
  &#39;a&#39; where the outer portion of the stem meets the uppermost arc--just can&#39;t
  seem to get it right.  I&#39;m wondering maybe if I&#39;m too picky, looking for,
  and seeing, that microscopic flaw that isn&#39;t actually a flaw.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  not entirely certain that I&#39;ve got the procedure for &#39;add tangent&#39; mastered
  in FontLab yet... <BR> <BR>Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.
