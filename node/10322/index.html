		<div class="commentbody"><p>I said I liked the design, but without any explanation, which is pretty useless as a critique. I did not have time to do more when I posted.</p>
<p>One reason I like the design is that it is a contrasty sans serif. I am fond of such fonts in general. I have made several attempts to produce a nice contrasty sans serif font, but they appear to be inherently difficult for some reason. Your design looks like it has fixed many of the problems I encountered.</p>
<p>The use of tapered strokes on some horizontals and verticals is interesting. This help fix the tendency for thin unterminated strokes to look weak, particularly in the capitals.</p>
<p>The body text sample is nice and readable, I would say.</p>
<p>I have a couple of criticisms. Please take these with a pinch of salt, because I am just an interested amateur.</p>
<p>The slanted cuts on the tops of the lower case verticals work nicely, and harmonise with the classic feel of the design. However, I am not sure about the same feature applied in the capitals, which would not have slanted serifs in a classic design. I also wonder if both verticals in &lsquo;u&rsquo; should be cut at a slant, instead of just the left one.</p>
<p>The tapered central stroke of the &lsquo;e&rsquo; looks a bit odd. Perhaps it should taper the other way (thick at right to thin at left), or not be tapered at all, as this stroke does not need a taper to firm it up.</p>
<p>Is there a good reason why the tapered horizontals should only appear at the bottom of E, Z and z? If you are hinting at the effects of serifs on the thin horizontals, I would have thought that the top strokes want tapers as much as the bottom ones. The single taper on the thin strokes of X and x looks a bit odd. The thin top right does not harmonize with similar stokes in Y, v, w, y.</p>
<p>I am perhaps being too conventional and obsessed with consistency in many of the above comments.</p>
<p>Anyway, keep up the good work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I get a 404 error on your website but your previous PDFs look good. It is a Syntax to Optima arena which is not attempted much&ndash;meaning you have chosen a good niche without lots of similar work in competition. I would like to see text in smaller sizes. it makes seeing it as a text font easier for me. I like the feeling of leaning caused by the strees in your b d p q.  You might try tightening the letterspacing a bit overall.  It feels a tad loose to me.</p>
