body: "Hello All\r\n\r\nThis is my first post and I have read through posting guidelines
  and threads about students and questions and was weighing up whether to still post.
  I decided to as I would value any input, not just for coursework, but also because
  I am genuinly interested in typography and the knowledge and experience that is
  available as part of this community.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here goes.  I have a piece of
  coursework where I have to lay out the first pages of a book.  I can choose what
  kind of book and would like to use poetry, specifically by the Sufi 12th Century
  poet Rumi. Although I have done a lot of research and have books on type and book
  design, I would like to see how others feel about this. My reason for choosing poetry
  is that it needs a different treatment to a text book, a novel or similar. Also
  it is something that inspires me and I would like to do it with as much care as
  possible. My reason for posting is that although I have been able to find some information
  about poetry, as opposed to prose, I would really welcome a discussion of this with
  any interested parties.\r\n\r\nI have looked at various typefaces and narrowed it
  down to Jenson, Bembo, Bodoni, Adobe Caslon and Goudy Old Style. After looking at
  various things such as the tail on the upper-case Q and the lower case gs I decided
  to go with Goudy Old Style, which I realise some may find slightly out of date,
  or hackneyed. \r\n\r\nI am also interested in using page margins that have the left
  page margin largest on the outside and the right page margin largest on the inside.
  My book will be 6 1/2 x 4 1/2.  I intend to put the folios at the bottom and centred.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I am really interested in opinions about setting poetry and the differences that
  there might be for this.  I would like to use upper case for the titles, but maybe
  in a small caps version.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading\r\n\r\nKathy "

    that Goudy Old Style, in the digital versions available, may be too refined and
    hence too precious for Rumi. It would tend to sentimentalize and not be \"old\"
    enough.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that it is one of the earlier classic old style faces
    to be digitized, and, based on intermediate sizes, is thus a bit emaciated at
    usual text sizes, due to the lack of \"press gain\" \u2014 i.e. as if it had been
    printed letterpress on coated stock."

  body: "Hi Kathy\r\n\r\nMost of what is written in typography textbooks about setting
    poetry concerns the need to distinguish it from any surrounding prose \u2013 see
    <a href=\"http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Blocks_and_Paragraphs/2.3.4/\">Bringhurst
    2.3.4 Indent or center verse quotations.</a>\r\n\r\nMost verse in my view, is
    set pretty open and generously-leaded, perhaps sometimes just to make the minimum
    extent that would justify a bound volume, however slim. \r\n\r\nBut you have a
    whole book to set (albeit not a very big one?) so, having arrived at the decisions
    you mention re: page size, margins, position of folios, typeface choice etc. the
    only thing to do is to try it out... set the pages and see what you get <em>en
    masse</em>. Test the design by getting other people to read it and tell you their
    responses. Don't forget the title pages and prelims."

  body: "Nick, thank you for your comments. I did wonder if the very things I find
    attractive about Goudy Old Style, its delicacy and lightness, might also make
    it look a bit diluted on the page. I have tried setting some poems in it, and
    although I still like it, I can see your point about preciousness. I think I will
    try a range of different typefaces and see what looks best. \r\n\r\nBen, thank
    you for your comments and suggestions.  I have Bringhurst and will read the section
    you mention, and also think about the other things you mention, such as leading.
    I have to create the first pages of a book, from the title page to the first double
    page spread, although obviously I need to take into account that there will be
    a whole book and to think about things like binding etc. I will certainly test
    by getting others to read and respond.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have to write a critique
    of my choice of typeface, margins, format etc, and it is good to include this
    kind of discussion.  I think that it will be considered a good thing to have joined
    this forum and discussed these issues, as it is an excellent way to learn about
    typography and to have to think about choices and do background research. Thank
    you for the time you have taken to respond.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have tried Goudy Catalogue in a test on one of the font vendors, and it
    doesn't quite work. Goudy Old Style definitely doesn't when laid out.  I have
    tried other typefaces and come down to two that I feel might work. These are Adobe
    Caslon and Arno Pro.  I am attaching an image of the Adobe Caslon, Goudy Old Style
    and Arno Pro (one using swashes for the italicised title).  I would really welcome
    opinions. With the Arno layout, I have used a slightly larger leading than for
    the other two.  I am not sure about using italics for the titles, but think it
    looks better than with them all in upper case. I hope my screenshot is clear enough.

  body: "Very nice. I have set an entire [[http://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Keats-Other-Poems/dp/0578005530|poetry
    book]] in Arno Pro, and it worked nicely. Caslon is also a good possibility, though
    maybe look at other versions, like Williams Caslon. Also, have you thought about
    using less than a full blank line between stanzas? The break is looking a little
    large, I think (or are you using more than a full line space already?). You may
    also want to differentiate the titles a little more with size or some other form
    of emphasis. And think about making the space after the title larger than the
    stanza breaks. Actually, with more space, the titles as you've designed them might
    work fine. For more feedback, it would be helpful if you could link to or upload
    a PDF.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited to add some more thoughts: I'm not a fan of the swash
    caps in the last example. Also, have you looked at other similar Slimbach faces,
    like Warnock (very different, a bit spiky), Brioso (very calligraphic), or Garamond
    Premier Pro? All of these could be used quite well for poetry, I think, depending
    on the feel you're looking for."

  body: "Thank you Joshua. I really like Arno Pro, it is a beautiful typeface. I will
    have a look at other versions of Caslon and at the size of the breaks between
    stanzas. I will also experiment with larger titles, or maybe a different weight,
    or small caps or some other way to differentiate.  \r\n\r\nI haven't looked at
    Warnock of Brioso, but I do like Garamond Premier Pro. Currently I do not have
    a huge amount of fonts, so have been trying them out on font shop web sites, where
    you can enter some words.\r\n\r\nAnother typeface I really like a lot is a more
    recent one - Feijoa, which I was thinking of purchasing\r\n\r\nThank you for the
    link to your book, I also had a look at the pdf on your site.  I like the way
    there is a bit of extra information included about the poem in italics, between
    the title and the body of the poem. "

  body: "Hi Kathy\r\n\r\nThere is more you might like to read about setting poetry
    (and plays) in the book called 'The Use of Type' by John R. Biggs, Blandford Press,
    London 1954.\r\n\r\nIt's hard for me to tell from the screen shot above, but maybe
    worth remembering that Indesign has an option in the preferences for type that
    reads 'Apply leading to entire paragraphs'. You should ensure that this is checked
    'on'."

  body: "\"Apply leading to entire paragraphs\" \u2026\r\n\r\nBut since in the case
    of poetry each line constitutes a \"paragraph,\" this wouldn't make a difference.
    Unless, of course, you end each line with a soft return, which is actually a handy
    thing to do, since you can then specify stanza breaks as before/after paragraph
    spaces. This avoids ending up with blank lines at the tops of pages, and makes
    it easier to change them all at once."

    book you mention.\r\n\r\nJoshua I am not sure I understand completely how soft
    returns and stanza breaks would work.  I know the space before and space after
    options in the paragraph styles, and will play around and look at how these affect
    my text.\r\n\r\nI am very happy with Arno Pro, which also has a lot of different
    styles and I am currently trying out different options for poem titles.  \r\n\r\nIt
    is a really interesting process and I am learning a great deal. As this is a piece
    of university coursework on typography and book design I have been trying things
    such as using the golden mean to lay out the page, dividing it into a grid of
    9x9 and other things. What I am finding is that the different elements, such as
    title and stanza do not easily fit exactly with a grid, at least the results do
    not seem as harmonious as doing it by eye.  The good thing is that I can put all
    of my experimentation into my critique and discuss it.\r\n\r\nOff now to play
    around with titles in different varieties and with different paragraph spacing
    between title and poem. "

  body: "> I am not sure I understand completely how soft \r\n> returns and stanza
    breaks would work\r\n\r\nAre you currently separating stanzas by inserting a blank
    line?  That technique has some disadvantages. Suppose you decide later to change
    the spacing between stanzas. You'd have to go back and individually select and
    change each blank line. Or you could select all the text and change the spacing,
    but unfortunately that would change the spacing of all lines, not just the blank
    lines.\r\n\r\nA better technique is to treat each stanza as a separate paragraph,
    use space before (or space after) in paragraph styles. That way in a few seconds
    you can globally adjust the spacing between all the stanzas without that affecting
    the space between individual lines. \r\n\r\nAnother advantage of eliminating blank
    lines is that you won't accidentally end up with a blank line at the top of a
    column.\r\n\r\nSince each stanza is one paragraph, if you want to manually insert
    a line break within a stanza you'd use a soft break (Shift + Return). A soft break
    tells the application that you want a line break but you're not starting a new
    paragraph. "
