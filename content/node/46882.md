body: "I need a font for a website- specifically for the logo/heading. I want something
  stylish but Classic. It also must look good in print for invoices etc. The website
  is quite girly and pink and sells beachwear. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I have looked
  at many and I am getting confused as to which will suit the site best.\r\nAlso-
  all caps, all small, or normal?\r\n\r\nSite is www.cloverberry.com. \r\n\r\nThanks"
