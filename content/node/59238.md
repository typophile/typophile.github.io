  texts, ornamental swashes and whatnot were sometimes used to separate blocks of
  paragraphs (where modern books typically use extra space) and also at the end of
  a column of text, e.g. at a chapter end. I attached an example of a separator and
  three chapter ends.\r\n\r\nMy first question is: what's the right terminology for
  these things?\r\n\r\nAlso, what resources could you suggest for investigating and
  looking at examples of them?\r\n\r\nAnd any font suggestions that include them?
  So far I identified ITC Type Embellishments, Adobe Woodtype Ornaments and Linotype
  Decoration Pi.\r\n\r\n-Tom"

    ornaments were issued with Monotype Columbus, Adobe Caslon, Minion. There are
    many nice collections of fleurons out there.\r\n\r\nAlso: standard sorts from
    many ornamented faces van also work nicely when a subtle fleuron is needed. Take
    a look at the period in Castellar, for instance.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n\r\n"
