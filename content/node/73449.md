  much but enough so you can see it in large point sizes.\r\n\r\nLineto.com with Lutz
  Headline, Replica and Akkurat is something I have in mind, but it would be great
  with something new.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/1.0/dbimg/jdbc/FONTS/img_font_7.gif\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    I'm looking for. I hope you get the picture.

  body: I suspect my suggestions might be a bit too retro/quircky. These quirky but
    contemporary looking grotesques are hard to come by. Perhaps you could team up
    with someone to draw something to your liking.
