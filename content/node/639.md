  body: 'Don&#39;t know what the face is, but this is a quote from an article on the
    WSJ redesign last year: &#34;The nameplate was an important recognizable element
    that had to stay. But it looked &#39;funereal&#39;, according to Dizney. So it
    was cleaned it up and made to look more contemporary by California-based type
    designer Jim Parkinson. The change was subtle.&#34; <BR> <BR>There was another
    thread about the faces in WSJ <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10959.html"
    target="_blank"> here</a>. Also with a link to <a href="http://www.typedesign.com/logos/wsj.html"
    target="_blank"> Parkinson&#39;s site</a>. <BR> <BR>Well, there&#39;s some info,
    but still no  ID :-/ Sorry.'
