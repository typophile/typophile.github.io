body: I'm a Windows 7 / Word 2010 user working on a book project. While there are
  many excellent text fonts out there, most look fairly bad in Windows. I'm attempting
  to find some suitable text fonts that are hinted for Windows so that they'll look
  as good on the screen as they do on paper. I've looked through all the text fonts
  included with Windows / Word, but none quite fit the bill. In a perfect world, I'd
  be able to find some nice humanist slab serif. Any suggestions would be greatly
  appreciated.

    quick peek, mefinks. Personally I think it's worth a lot more, though...

  body: The display issue is likely related to font format, rather than hinting per
    se. The Windows GDI PostScript renderer is about fifteen years old and is generally
    very poor for rendering text size. So PostScript fonts, whether Type 1 or OpenType
    format, will tend to display badly at text sizes on screen in most Windows apps.
    [The newer DWrite rendering is much better, but only found in some recent applications,
    e.g. IE9.]

    FF Ernestine and [[https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-tisa-web-pro|FF Tisa]] are humanist
    slab serifs offered by Fontshop in Truetype format, hinted for recent Windows
    versions. If you want consistent good* looking text in Win XP (recent means anything
    after this) as well, you need a lot of Truetype hinting. \r\n\r\n* Good is a relative
    term with such a course pixel grid and only black and white or grey pixels."

  body: '@mikebara didn''t say anything about TrueType, either. John''s latest is
    a useful reminder, though, why type tends to look ugly on screen: Coarse resolution
    and clapped-out renderers.'
