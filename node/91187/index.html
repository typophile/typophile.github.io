<p>At Kontrapunkt we released our second free typeface called Bob for you to download use for whatever you want.
Some might remember the previous &lsquo;Kontrapunkt&rsquo; typeface released 10 years ago. It is of course still for download and available on our website, too. For the release of the new typeface we also designed a microwebsite with a playful type-tester in javascript and HTML5.</p>
<p>You can download the typefaces and try them out here:
<a href="http://www.kontrapunkt.com/type/">http://www.kontrapunkt.com/type/</a></p>
<p>Please do share your opinions on the typefaces here on the board or on twitter via hashtag #kptype</p>
<p>Best regards
Philip Battin</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I hope this&rsquo;ll communicate as useful feedback, not complaint.  I have an older PC and a dial-up Internet connection.  The WEB page for &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; displays, but it is so &ldquo;busy&rdquo; with non-stop animation that it would never settle down and let me press the download button.  That is, I tried, but the animation continued unaffected and the cursor never changed to a &ldquo;finger pointer&rdquo; to tell me the browser was ready to start the download.  So, I can be tantalized by the offer but can never secure the font!  Is this download available on a quiet or still site, maybe an archive, where an old dinosaur can also download it?  I very much appreciate the offer of a usable free font.  I just don&rsquo;t understand why many font WEB site designers load up their sites with bandwidth and processor-demanding Flash, Java, and other animations that add nothing to the experience.  There are attractive sites where I can still visit with my old equipment and see a prompt display and download quickly.  (Blambot&rsquo;s a good example, but not the only one.)   Others take a while to display, but they do finally function.  I may be in a minority of font-loving users with restricted access, but surely I&rsquo;m not the only one.  Further, you can showcase your design skills without all the complicated stuff; and everybody who shows up will be able to enjoy and take advantage of it.   Thanks for listening, and thanks for the offer &ndash; maybe someday I&rsquo;ll be able to take advantage of it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, thank you for the courteous, professional response.   I appreciated that very much.</p>
<p>The rest of this note is my reply to Philip&rsquo;s question about my PC and browser specs.  Other readers, if that sounds too much off-topic or you just don&rsquo;t care, just stop reading here.  No harm, no foul.</p>
<p>These specifics describe my surfing PC, but I am sure they are not typical; and I can almost hear guffawing as people read them  However, there are still a great many people who do surf with dial-up, PCs with 2MB or less of memory,  and versions of Windows no longer supported by MS.  I use K-Meleon 1.5.3 to surf, which, though based on Firefox, is stripped, more efficient code cleaned to run on older, slower computers.  It also provides the higher level of encryption many sites demand.  There&rsquo;s a newer version, but it&rsquo;s based on different code and won&rsquo;t run on my OS.  The PC is an Acer-built IBM Aptiva which originally could only support a single MB of RAM and 6GB max hard drives.  I&rsquo;ve patched the Win95 and put in another controller card, so now it&rsquo;s juggling 300 GB without problems.  I&rsquo;ve replaced the power supply a couple of times.  It&rsquo;s also on a wireless network to my Vista PC and some Win98 PCs, which several technicians told me would never be possible after MS scrapped the old Novel networking protocol and tricked up TCP/IP so the new can&rsquo;t talk to the old.   Though the processor speed is slow, I think only 165 MHz, it is faster than the dial-up Internet connection requires.  I generally have few, if any, problems surfing WEB sites.  According to a database I maintain, I&rsquo;ve visited more than 3,000 font and typeface-related URLs.  Last night at FontSquirrel and Ascender Corp.</p>
<p>Why, people ask, do I surf with this antique when I also own a Vista and a Win7 PC that I keep off-line?  There are several reasons, but some of the more important are that (1) it&rsquo;s really surprising how well it works.  With K-Meleon, I am able to access and use almost all the WEB sites I wish.  I cannot, however, run the latest versions of Java or Flash.  On the rare occasion I really need speed, I carry my Win7 laptop to the public library, where savings from using their free Wi-Fi paid for the laptop in less than a year.  As an example, to download the Open Office Suite takes about 12 hours at home, if I&rsquo;m not cut off.  At the library, 12 minutes.  (2) Almost all the new malware targets features my machine&rsquo;s OS  does not have.  I still run anti-virus, a firewall,  and a pop-blocker, but the box has dodged all sorts of attempts to  harm it and my data.  (3) The final reason is learning curve.  Despite its limitations, I&rsquo;ve just about mastered all it and my software can do.  I can usually do better and faster work with my old machine than most of my friends with the latest and greatest.   I can work as or more quickly on the old PC than on either of the new ones with far greater tech specs.  In fact,  friends with much newer equipment and software call me to solve problems and sometimes to undo damage.</p>
<p>If thist leads to making more WEB sites accessible to more visitors, I guess it&rsquo;ll be worth the embarrassment of detailing how much good service I&rsquo;m still getting from my &ldquo;Model T&rdquo; PC.  (I do not, however, go on-line with my old CP/M KayPro; though it still works, too.)</p>
