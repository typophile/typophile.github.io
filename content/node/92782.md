  guessed, Microsoft updated Times New Roman and Arial. But, to my surprise, Comic
  Sans MS also gets a big update! It now supports Italic and Swash...\r\n\r\nWell,
  the Italic typeface actually just looks like an oblique one. But the Italic Swash
  part is just crazy..."

    some quite serious uses, in part due to its excellent readability."

    with the default glyph set.\r\n\r\nSecond, as far as I know Comic Sans has a popular
    use. Do people who set their texts with Comic Sans use swashes? I doubt it. This
    feature will probably stay buried. I like Comic Sans as it is.\r\n\r\nIf I could
    have written this text in swashed Comic Sans I'd have been able to convey my feelings
    more effectively."

    point. I just hope people leave behind the frivolous Comic Sans fashion before
    they notice the swash adjunct. But by that I'm just willing to forget that, precisely
    with this expansion, Microsoft is trying to trigger a <i>second wave</i>."

    the Windows EULA. On the plus side most of these fonts (or equivalents) should
    be available via our licensing arrangement with Ascender/Monotype, if not now,
    then in the near future (once enough browsers support OT). \r\n\r\nWe posted demos
    by Font Bureau, Font Shop and Monotype that show both OT support coupled with
    @font-face delivery. Link here... http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/09/css-corner-using-the-whole-font.aspx "

    found that most web site publishers seem to be able to work out what they can
    and can't do with our fonts, and the hosting services have done a good job of
    helping guide site owners along the right path. \r\n\r\nThe inclusion of OpenType

    can bring to their content and inevitably they'll seek out providers like The
