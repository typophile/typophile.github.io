		<div class="commentbody">I have been discussing this same issue with Peter and can duplicate the problem on a fresh OS X installation - so it doesn't appear to be related to any font management utilities or other system extensions. The same fonts work perfectly under OS 9. The problem exists in several other libraries as well, just not every face is affected. Regenerated the font does not always fix the problem. <BR> <BR>Here are a couple of screen captures illustrating what we are seeing. <BR> <BR>The first image shows Fountain's Eric Sans and Udo families as they appear in Apple's TextEdit. Note that the space character appears to be complete missing from the italic weight of Eric Sans, while the word spacing is double what it should be in the Udo weight. <BR> <BR>The second image shows the same faces displaying with the proper spacing within Adobe InDesign 2.0.2 &hellip; in fact any Adobe application under OS X (including CS versions) displays the fonts correctly. I am assuming that this is due to Adobe applications using CoolType to render text, rather then Apple's OS-based services. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/64353.gif" alt="Eric Sans and Udo in TextEdit"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/64354.gif" alt="Eric Sans and Udo in InDesign"> <BR> <BR>Thoughts on this, anyone?</div>

Like I mentioned before, the same fonts work perfectly well in OS 9. The same fonts work in Adobe applications which do not use the same method of rendering text. The fact that these odd spacing issues follow through to the printer indicates something dreadfully wrong with the way the operating system is handling the fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Grant, Peter,  <BR> <BR>Mac OS 9 and Adobe applications use Adobe software (ATM/CoolType) to render the Type 1 fonts. Mac OS X uses Apple's own ATSUI renderer. The most obvious differences are visible with hinting. Mac OS X displays some extreme deterioration of screen display of Type 1 font, which is &quot;ironed over&quot; a bit when the type is antialiased. But it's thoroughly possible that other aspects of the fonts, e.g. metrics, kerning, or special treatment of particular characters, is realized differently in the ATSUI model by Apple than in the ATM/CoolType model by Adobe.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think I may have figured out what's going on. <BR> <BR>It seems to have to do with the HT character in the low ASCII range. If a font has a character defined there, the Apple rasterizer seems to display that instead of the usual space character when you type a space. Most T1 fonts don't have an HT character defined, which is probably why most T1 fonts don't have this problem. I wonder if this is some UNIX/Next thing from way back? <BR> <BR>I've found a few on my system (including some of my own) which do have the HT character and they all exhibit this behavior. I don't remember adding this character to the fonts in question, but I do recall that it's easy to inadvertently define a character in FOG simply by selecting the character cell.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mark, that makes sense, at least too why the spacing is so wide  in Udo &amp; the very narrow in EricSans Italic. But the other fonts in those 2 families have the same width in the HT slot. <BR>What would be a &quot;defined character&quot;? There's no vector points in that slot.  <BR>And what would be a solution? copying the &quot;Space&quot; width to &quot;HT&quot;?</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I think the solution would be to delete the HT character from the font. There's no reason to include it anyway. <BR> <BR>You can tell if it's been defined by opening the Type 1 font in FontLab. If the glyph cell is white, then it has been defined. It's not necessary for it to have any vector points to be defined. For instance, double-clicking on an empty (gray) cell in FontLab will define a new glyph 1 em wide with no outline data. <BR> <BR>The reason I know it's the HT character that's causing the trouble is because one of the fonts I tested is an old font I made which has a particluar character in that slot, and that character showed up instead of the expected space character in TextEdit and FontBook. I have a hunch there may be other low-ASCII characters causing problems as well in some cases. <BR> <BR>I think the rule here is: Don't define any low ASCII characters except for the ones which are part of the MacOS Roman character set (e.g., Eth, eth, etc.). It didn't used to be a problem because the Adobe rasterizer ignored them, but apparently Apple's OS X rasterizer doesn't.</div>

The difficulty I was having was determining whether some component of the fonts themselves were the trigger.
