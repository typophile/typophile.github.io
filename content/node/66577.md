  They are not \u201Cmoderators.\u201D A moderator prescreens content. Content is
  notoriously not prescreened on Typophile, resulting in spam post after spam post.\r\n\r\nThe
  choice of terminology is important. (Times \u201CNew Roman\u201D is not a \u201Csansserif.\u201D)
  \u201CModerator\u201D connotes a degree of prior restraint that doesn\u2019t exist.
  It also insinuates that immoderate comments will be censored. Whereas an admin merely
  administers a site and keeps it running.\r\n\r\n\u201CModerators\u201D need to stop
  using that malapropism to refer to themselves. They\u2019re admins, not moderators.\r\n"

    feel that most online discussion forums have, and\r\nb) Put a HUGE workload onto
    the Moderators who, as far as I know, are volunteers.\r\n\r\nPre-screening content
    is good for blog comments, but does not work for a discussion forum.\r\n\r\n -

  body: "I don't think Joe usually goes about things the right way, but this concerted
    effort he's making is useful, and should be appreciated on face value. In fact
    I agree with some (maybe more than half) of the things he's proposing.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I fear however is that if/when few of his suggestions actually get implemented,
    he will throw an epic hissy-fit, effectively undoing much of this positive energy.
    But this won't happen if he simply realizes that Typophile is quite useful as
    it stands, and if it never becomes a \"perfect\" web presence that's OK. Typophile
    is about type, not demo-ing web standards.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: While Typophile certainly does have admins, moderators are sometimes required
    to step in and *cautiously* arbitrate when things get out of hand. It doesn't
    happen often on Typophile (perhaps thanks in part to our admittedly easy to circumvent
    swears filter ;). Folks here are largely good people, but when this many passionate
    people get into it, sometimes things can get rough. If the moderation that happens
    is so light and behind the scenes that people don't notice it happening, I count
    that as a success.

    Moderation can also involve removal of immoderate postings afterwords.

    issues. But this thread is basically drivel. I mean, seriously? <em>Prescreening</em>
    a real-time discussion board? Funny stuff. I have been a regular on many forums,
    and the best ones are those where the moderators refrain from moderating as much
    as possible, and only jump in when it is really necessary. And moderating is,
    in fact, not necessary very often."
