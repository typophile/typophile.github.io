  \ I have something similar but I have no idea where I got it.  Its called Village
  Square, but if I search for it I cant find its family.  If you have any ideas and
  can steer me to the correct family, I'd appreciate it.  What I have is regular and
  I really need bold... or ideas on what the actual font is.\r\n\r\nUsually I can
  find a font family with no troubles.  If I aquired something down the line that
  isnt legit I'd like to know so I can pitch it.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJill"
