  for far too long, I've finally found the courage (through the help of a course at
  University) to delve into the wonderful world of fontlab.\r\n\r\nI was hoping for
  some critique of what I've got so far, I have been working with a strict grid system
  which has worked well most of the time although I'm still having a lot of trouble
  with the s, z, x and c. Getting the spacing right has also been quite hard, (especially
  with the extremities on the r and e) and has led me to create a series of Ligatures
  which I believe solves the problem and adds more visual interest. I set these up
  as dlig in fontlab because I read somewhere that it was appropriate however, I'm
  tempted to just put them through as liga. Advisable?\r\n\r\n I am fully aware that
  this font completely loses itself in small sizes, however I believe that in larger
  sizes when I've tweaked it properly, it could work really well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
  think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fabrik_RLM_4381.jpg]"
