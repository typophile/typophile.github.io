  body: "Right Nick. Apple has shaped my professional life as a graphic designer and
    type designer since 1988.\r\nOther influences such as Fontographer have fallen
    by the wayside, or like Quark fallen from favour. Over the years non-Mac folk
    have often suggested Apple's imminent demise as if it were some kind of flakey
    sideshow as opposed to the reality of Microsoft, but Apple's reality is just as
    valid. <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/DeeperIn.pdf\">Here's</a> my
    take on that. So I do think there is a durable philosophy that is as much a part
    of the brand he's built, as his presence. Best wishes, Mr Jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
