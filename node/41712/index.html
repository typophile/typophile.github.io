  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just read [[http://typophile.com/node/41365|this]], so now I want to perform such a legibility test. Actually, I really want to test readability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll set the same word in different fonts, have subjects read through them in random order, record how long each took. I still have to decide what &ldquo;reading&rdquo; means here; I&rsquo;ll figure out the details over the week.</p>
<p>I could also do the same for longer texts to test readability, but there are obvious problems with this: The text would need to be really long in order to measure legibility properly, so I&rsquo;ll have to come up with some way to account for the memory of the previous readings of the same text.</p>
<p>I already know I need help determining how to account for differences in width among fonts for testing readability. How do you suggest that I account for this? Here are my only ideas so far:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering what English words and text to use. Any ideas?</p>
<p>EDIT: Cool, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_survey|people already do this]], except it seems like font hasn&rsquo;t been tested so much as general layout.</p>

<p>Those test are done for decades. You should do a little research before you start your own survey. 
Also, I guess you need to set yourself a particular goal. &ldquo;Testing legibility&rdquo; or »Testing readability« is way too broad. You will not get any useful results when you don&rsquo;t focus on single parameters.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I&rsquo;m developing news text faces, I pick an existing face as a benchmark and try to match the character count, with identical leading, column width, and h&amp;j settings.</p>
<p>I then try to match the apparent size of my new face to the benchmark.</p>
<p>This approach is necessary because my clients always compare my new face to their existing face, and want it to look &ldquo;as big&rdquo; &ndash; which is code for readability &ndash; if not bigger, and they don&rsquo;t want to lose words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to get an exact match, and the comparative settings may involve fractional point sizes and leading sizes. However, the main thing is character count.</p>
<p>Having done this, it&rsquo;s still not unusual for a client to nuance the setting once they have the finished font. For instance, I had optimized one typeface for 9 on 9.5, and my client bumped it up to 9.3 on 9.5. Another client decided that their face needed negative 10 tracking. Yet another likes to horizontally scale 95%!</p>
<p>Minute changes to the polyvariant complex of size, leading, scaling, tracking and h&amp;js can have a huge effect, which is why the idea that typeface readability can be reduced to a simple measurement is completely banal.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I didn&rsquo;t do much research before I posted this. Now that I see that this has already been done a million times, I&rsquo;ll just play around with it so I can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->see<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the difference myself. I won&rsquo;t worry too much about whether the methodology is rigorous. I think I&rsquo;ll print some random phrases in different faces and sizes and see how hard they are to read from different distances. Later, I may also try setting random texts in different faces and timing myself to read them, but I still have to figure out how to choose suitable texts without reading them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it would be good to choose a text you can read because otherwise your are not - reading. It might be a good idea to keep reading about methodologies as well. If your goal is not to compare readability though go with what feels good &amp; maybe read Lawson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters of credit&rdquo;. And Bringhurst. See the books area in &ldquo;resources&rdquo; up above.</div>
