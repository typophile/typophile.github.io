body: A week ago I gave a 90-minute lecture to the Japan Society of Northern California
  about Kazuraki, which is the first genuinely proportional Japanese font. Although
  a significant portion of the lecture included a live demo of this font in Adobe
  InDesign, I thought that some of the people on this forum would enjoy going through
  the presentation, along with seeing its specimen book. You can download both of
  them from [[http://japansocietyofnortherncalifornia.myshopify.com/products/kazuraki|here]].

  body: This question may be answered by a more careful re-reading of the documents
    linked to above but - It seems like in addition to all the programming and testing
    involved to get both horizontal and vertical relationships the way you want them,
    a release of this kind also could not take advantage of a skeleton+stroke basis
    for building glyphs,especially beyond the most common 3000 or so, and so would
    be far more labour intensive for that reason as well. Is that correct?

  body: "Yes, considering that each glyph is effectively a calligraphic work of art,
    and individually drawn, the regularity that would result from the use of glyph
    elements would detract from this effect. At least, that's my opinion.\r\n\r\nIf
    a larger Japanese type foundry, with more than one designer, were to take on the
    design and development of a similar typeface, they could potentially include a
    larger number of glyphs. Kazuraki has a single designer. Well, \"single\" in the
    sense of there being only one. Ryoko Nishizuka is married and has a daughter.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I just dug up the [[http://www20.morisawa.co.jp/museum/contest/e/2002wabun_gin_e.html|page]]
    on Morisawa's website that shows the original form of Kazuraki when it won the
    Silver Prize at their 2002 Typeface Design Competition. \r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior

  body: The Latin glyphs are derived from Brioso Pro Semibold Display. They are "derived"
    in that they are scaled 108% to better match the Japanese glyphs.

  body: We were originally planning to leave the Latin glyphs completely out of the
    font, but encountered too many assumptions/dependencies that forced us to include
    the glyphs. One of these dependencies was related to IMEs.
