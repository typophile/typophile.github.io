    imagine that those were ways of saving space... If you look at old manuscripts
    and even early printed books, you will see many abbreviated words -- the abbreviations
    were a way to save space or make words fit. (By the way, I just found a PDF on
    early American tombstone inscriptions <a href=\"http://www.davidrumsey.com/farber/Early%20American%20Gravestones.pdf\">here</a>.)"

  body: "The interesting thing to me is the inconsistency of the way some of the contractions
    were done. For example, one \"THE\" uses an HE ligature, but others don't, and
    isn't YE just an archaic form of THE?  It's almost like the stonecarver found
    his layout needed these adaptations to maintain symmetry on the face of the stone,
    as each line is centered. Almost as if he worked from the edges toward the center.\r\n\r\n-
