  from a infographic I saw on a designer's flickr-photostream, [[http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=853650392&size=o|here]]."

    will post a question to the flickr-page as well, I don't know why I didn't do
    that before."

  body: Well, after I got the obvious idea to ask the guy himself on flickr, he replied
    that he designed it himself. I don't know if he designed it from cratch, or if
    he edited a couple of characters though. It could very well be some kind of DIN-like
    face, with a couple of custom glyphs.

    Typophile</a> too. That typeface is a custom work he did for the University of
    Santiago in Chile, drawn from scratch, not modified from other outlines as far
    as I know. I alerted him of this thread, he\u2019ll probably chime in later on."

  body: I'm not sure the cap M works (I'd be curious how a Gotham/Din-like treatment
    would look), but otherwise I like this a lot. I love how the stylish treatment
    of a couple of key characters can give a face a fresh look, even one that's in
    familiar territory.

    offend Juan Pablo with thinking it might be edited, I didn't want to. :) \r\n\r\nI
    absolutely love the infographic and typework. I think it's looking very impressive.
    The face just has this DIN-like character, only with this very cool 'R', and a
    couple of other key elements that give this a very new look. This is information-design
    which also looks good."

    the M though. Would be interesting to see it with a different twist.

  body: "I'm crying of happines. I am the typographer who design this font...\r\nIt's
    true... \"M\" can have some problems, but this is not a final version. I designed
    this font at the time I was designing the infography. And I think this is not
    the final version. I remember I fixed the \"M\" when I change the numbers from
    oldstyle to caps.\r\nMany books are working with \"ugly\" typefaces, but too cools
    and with a fresh look. And I wanted to design an special font, because a great
    designer in Chile give me the great oportunity to work with him...\r\n\r\nI thinked
    that nobody will like to my font. I designed 3 weights in about 2 weeks... I will
    have to end it, and talk with some foundry that want to sell it. (I have about
    150 characters by weight)\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nDon't forget to read [[http://letritas.blogspot.com|\"letritas\"]]"

    the blog and not the infographic. My mistake. I'm a good beta tester for any font
    though so if you need testers just let me know.

    is a grotesque sans serif in the DIN tradition. Designed originally to support
    the typographic needs of an advanced mathematical thesis paper, Beauchef knows
    how to let the information take the spotlight, but still retains enough attitude
    to convey energy and zeitgeist. Beauchef is readable and clear, with a crisp accuracy
    you and balanced geometry based on tabular numerals. Humble, yet expressive. Simple,
    yet avant-garde.\r\n\r\nBeauchef has a personality perfectly suited for authoritative
    short paragraphs, headlines, chapter headings, and declarations of principles,
    rich computer graphics and the like. But it can also speak clearly in long text
    passages.\r\n\r\nThe font family features small caps, fractions, superior, inferior
    and lining numerals, plus full Western European language support.</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CTT0000250_P_6135.GIF]"
