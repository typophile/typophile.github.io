  type. Does anyone know who designed it and the history about the plain gothic typeface?

    or point to?

  body: Try looking for the term "grotesk" or "grotesque" instead, that may come up
    with what you're looking for better.

    like at 55pts I believe...I remember someone saying it's a block typeface or something,
    like it was made out of wood carved block...\r\nI'll check grotesque"

  body: Did you mean "plain gothic"  just as a description, then (rather than a specifid
    font name)? Your sample has almost no distinguishing characteristics. Except for
    the apostrophe , it matches any number of contemporary digital fonts, such as
    Akzidenz Grotesk,  Red Rooster's Block Gothic, Monopol, Plakette,  and others.  If
    you're looking for history, you might as well investigate the general history
    of sans serif type. That's about a third of the many tens of thousands of typefaces
    out there.

  body: Plain Gothic is the name of the typeface. This is for research for a letterpress
    project. I guess I'll check out sans serif type's history and see what comes up
