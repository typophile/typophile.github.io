  Why No Type Con? Maybe I'm not looking hard enough.

    local events, send a delegation to typecon, and lobby for a conference. With a
    bit of work and a bit of luck I think you could pull this off in five to seven
    years. '

    in hosting TypeCon each year. So that is one important factor in the decisions
    about locale. \r\n\r\nIf you can round up enough seriously interested, committed,
    and reliable folks, let us know. We'd be happy to hear about ideas for future
    TypeCon cities. \r\n\r\n-- K."

    to TypeCon next summer, preferably with a group of local type and design geeks,
    and let''s have a discussion about the possibilities. Consider yourself invited
    to volunteer at the conference if you want to find out what it''s all about from
    the inside out. Contact me offline to discuss: tamye (at) typesociety.org.'
