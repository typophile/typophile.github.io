body: Hello! <BR>I just started working on a grayscale font which will replace anti-aliased
  Univers 55 and 53 &#40;9, 10 and 12pt&#41; on a Flash site. The client isn&#39;t
  happy with the current site &#40;the text is &#34;blurry&#34; - which is due to
  the font, Flash antialising, and also the colors, which I can&#39;t change&#41;
  so I need to make two screen fonts, which won&#39;t have features that stray too
  far from the Univers family. <BR>I tried out existing pixel fonts, but they look
  too much like pixel fonts. Then I discovered Ultrafonts, and after a few tests in
  Photoshop, I&#39;m pretty sure grayscale pixfonting is the way to go. Don&#39;t
  get me wrong, the result won&#39;t look like Univers, it will just be the closest
  possible, as well as legible, at small sizes. Very neutral, not hip in any way.
  <BR>I read on Typophile that it&#39;s tricky to actually turn font designs into
  grayscale bitmap fonts. Why? is it a hack of some sort? I don&#39;t intend to sell
  this font &#40;it will belong to my client, since it&#39;s based on a registered
  typeface etc.&#41; so the concept of splitting revenue with Truth in Design just
  to use their software once seems silly. Then again, I don&#39;t know how tricky
  the process is... Either way I&#39;d love to learn more about it! <BR>Oh and I&#39;ll
  post some images in Critique when it&#39;s over 5% done...

  body: '&#62; grayscale pixfonting is the way to go. <BR> <BR>Yyyup. <BR>BTW, I recently
    discovered another advantage of grayscale fonts over b&amp;w pixelfonts: they&#39;re
    more harmonious with the large type renderings in a composition &#40;like titles,
    logos&#41;, which are always anti-aliased. And yeah, they&#39;re not horridly
    blurry - like here: <a href="http://www.catalanadetipos.com/" target="_blank">http://www.catalanadetipos.com/</a>
    Click on &#34;Castellano&#34;, choose one of the top two links, and drown in the
    blur... <BR> <BR>It&#39;s tricky to make them because the TT outlines have to
    look quite funny for the rendering to actually come out reliably on different
    platforms, applications, etc. For example between Flash and Photoshop. The Ultrafonts
    boys have spent a lot of time and brains figuring it out - they even have an automatic
    converter! Also, you should know that the trick is patented &#40;the problematic
    prior art issue turned out to be a subset of it&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for your concern
    of &#34;just using it once&#34;: <BR>- If your client wants exclusivity, he should
    pay extra for it. <BR>- If it&#39;s not exclusive, nothing should stop you from
    using the nice resultant fonts on other projects, or even selling them &#40;probably
    through Ultrafonts&#41;. <BR> <BR>That said, I don&#39;t think any of the existing
    Ultrafonts will work for you here. But be warned, it&#39;s quite hard to get the
    hang of it. If you need help, and have the budget, I can do it for you. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'Thanks a lot for your reply! <BR> <BR>Indeed, the available ultrafonts are
    not what I need, but it&#39;s okay because I know exactly what I want. <BR> <BR>I
    wish this client had the budget to pay a real typographer, but they don&#39;t
    have a cent at the moment &#40;literally&#41; and I&#39;m just doing this to make
    everyone happy. Type-wise it&#39;s actually WORSE than the site you mentioned!
    <BR> <BR>So yes, you&#39;re right, I should sell the font once it&#39;s made,
    or at least try... <BR> <BR>For the moment I&#39;m designing the font&#40;s&#41;
    in photoshop and I&#39;ll figure something out when it&#39;s time to build them.
    <BR> <BR>To be continued... <BR> <BR>ps: I just realized you&#39;re the designer
    of Mana - brilliant work!'

  body: 'Glad you like Mana! <BR>The 11 should be out in about two weeks. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    I&#39;ll figure something out when it&#39;s time <BR> <BR>Just know that I waited
    6 years between making the Mana-16 bitmaps and actually delivering a working font...
    :-/  So unless you could simply fall back on using text-as-image if you have to&#42;,
    make sure you have a mechanism in place to deliver working -and robust- fonts
    before you spend all that time painting thousands of little gray dots! <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Which is only good for short text. <BR> <BR>One other thing: make sure to check
    the results on Windows as you&#39;re working, since the gammas are quite different
    between platforms. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: hi! <BR>- After a few days solid pushing greyscale pixels &#40;I nearly went
    insane&#41; and lots of testing, I can say that it&#39;s a lot easier to design
    a font from scratch than to try to adapt an existing one. Univers has many very
    characteristic features, and they are hard to transpose to a 9x6 pixel grid. When
    I stay too close to the original typeface, the most obvious weaknesses are in
    fact the typical Univers features. Take them out and keep working, and it becomes
    an okay-looking grayscale pixel font with absolutely no particular style. Which
    is actually worth pursuing, I think, but it&#39;s not my original idea. I&#39;ve
    been studying the optical illusion &#40;or psycho-visual effect... or whatever
    it could be called&#41; of shading, it&#39;s quite fascinating! <BR>I use Windows
    on a high resolution, haven&#39;t tried viewing my work on a Mac yet, only on
    my cellphone, and I&#39;m aware there will be a lot work to find the right shades
    &#40;I think each font has its own perfect values&#41;.

  body: Welcome to loonieland!  :-&#62; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s good you&#39;re using Windows
    - you&#39;ll err on the side of aliasing &#40;which people are used to&#41; instead
    of blur on the Mac &#40;which is fatal&#41;. Just make everything a hair too dark.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; only on my cellphone <BR> <BR>Could you explain how you do that?
    My way involves a third party, and the &#34;latency&#34; can be annoying. <BR>

  body: Windows has a darker default gamma setting &#40;2.2&#41; than Macs &#40;1.8&#41;,
    so middle tones look relatively darker on Windows, relatively lighter on Macs.  <BR>
    <BR>This can have noticeable effects on the appearance of antialiasing created
    for one platform viewed on the other. Windows antialiasing looks washed out when
    viewed on a Mac, Mac antialiasing looks heavy and blurry when viewed on a Windows
    machine.

  body: '&#62; Windows antialiasing looks washed out when viewed on a Mac <BR> <BR>Which
    makes anti-aliased fonts &#40;at least the good hand-made kind&#41; look closer
    to plain old 1-bit screen fonts, which people are used to! So it&#39;s simply
    less bad. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: hello again, sorry for the slow reply... <BR>I gave up this project! I guess
    I didn&#39;t realize how much work it needs to get a good font. Now I have even
    more respect for grayscale pixel masters! <BR>I just don&#39;t have enough time...

    <BR>About putting the font on a cellphone, I didn&#39;t actually implement a custom
    font or anything, just transferred a GIF via bluetooth.

  body: Heh heh. Yup, the complexities in grayscale design are not a subset of either
    b&amp;w or outline design - the importance it places on illusion is unique in
    the field, perhaps even more pronounced than designing phone book fonts. <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t know if I proposed this before, but if/when you have the budget
    to outsource such work, I&#39;m here. <BR> <BR>&#62; just transferred a GIF via
    bluetooth. <BR> <BR>Could you please detail this process? Thanks much. <BR> <BR>hhp
