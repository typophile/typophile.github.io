  trends in treatment of medical disorders. These will be published in PDF format
  for both on-screen reading and printing off the web. The audience will be physicians.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for ideas for fonts for the main body of text as well as headers, titles,
  etc. There should be a certain gravitas to the results, so I'm looking for thoughts
  on font combinations as much as individual recommendations.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    and was quite pleased. And Adobe's own fonts allow full embedding."

  body: "Esta is a very nice looking font, and I'm sure it could work well, but I
    don't think it will work _as_ well for on-screen PDFs. \r\n\r\nWarnock was designed
    with on screen use in mind. See the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/WarnockPro.pdf\">specimen
    book.</a>\r\n\r\nAlso, the fact that it's a very full featured OpenType font could
    matter, depending on the demands of your text, and if you're using an OpenType
    savvy app."
