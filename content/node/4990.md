  body: If it&#39;s of any help, the font they&#39;re using here &#40;taken from comedycentral.com&#41;
    is Font Bureau&#39;s Garage Gothic, with the counters filled in. <BR> <BR><img

    <BR> <BR>For short batches of text, it would be pretty simple to set the type
    in Illustrator/Corel/Quark/InDesign, convert it to outlines, and start deleting
    bezier points. <BR> <BR>
