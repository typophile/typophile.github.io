		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the plug Eduardo.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've done a bunch more besides Vanity Fair, and in all those experiences it has ALWAYS been the art director of the magazine that had a very particular view of what the magazine should be typographically. I have not always agreed with their vision, but happily created whatever they asked me to create. So I think Stephanie should really look at the art directors and plot the various magazines they have worked on. I'll bet bullets to bagels that there is a consistent type selection going on throughout their careers. Whether or not it is good magazine typography is a matter of opinion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a related note, if you find a current issue of Glamour, there are a bunch of things in there that I've recently done, A high contrast Perpetua Display in 6 optical sizes (for those of you who fancy those things) and in particular a Roundhand script whose rights will revert back to me in 2005. I'm busy working up a bunch of alternate glyphs for the OpenType it will become. I would post a sample, but Glamour has the exclusive rights to it till May 2005.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">James, I checked out Glamour today. Typopgraphy-wise it looks busy, but they probably know what they're doing. As for the Perpetua, I think it's working great. Some questions: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Do you think they're actually going to the trouble of using the optical sizes properly? If you look at page 72 for example (the May issue), there's at least three sizes of the type, but they all seem to be the same master. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Did they ask for the optical sizes, or is that something you convinced them was a good idea? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) How did they choose Perpetua in the first place - did they ever verbalize a reason to you? I actually think it's a good -and interesting- choice, I'm just wondering what their thought process was. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) Are you sure Monotype doesn't mind? Sure, the data is from scratch, but stylistically it's totally Perpetua, no? On the other hand, the magazine owns a license to a version of the original, so&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephanie, the issue of readability is extremely complex - to the point that it might not be understood within our lifetimes. But I think we can grasp parts of it, like the issue of vertical proportions (especially x-height). On the other hand, you'll never get everybody to agree on the details! In fact the following explanation isn't something &quot;the establishment&quot; endorses (but mostly because they simply haven't bothered to think about the issue enough - to take it seriously). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just like there's a duality between display and text type, there's a duality between legibility and readability. The former relies on the clear decipherability of individual symbols. As you say, it's easy to ensure decent legibility*; you'd have to make the text very small, the lighting very poor, or the letterforms extremely strange to reduce legibility substantially. This makes it fall in the realm of display typography, because people have plenty of time to decipher and compile the letters. But the latter (readability) deals with reading at the limits of performance, like when you're deep into a fast-paced novel, or trying to finish an article before an important meeting. In this case, the brain is more in a hurry, so it uses more of the retina, and relies more on its powerful heuristics to partly guess what the words are (to speed things up)**. Part of the reason to rely on guesswork is that most of the surface of the retina has low resolution, so you can't even see the individual letters very well (unless you take the time to look at all of them directly, but that slows things down unacceptably - and the point is unnecessarily). But you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> see the outlines of words much deeper into the retina, and because these outlines -when taken in the context of &quot;expected&quot; phrases and grammatical structures- are enough to nail down the actual word, it works out geat. This means that such &quot;immersive&quot; reading relies more on ascenders and descenders in proportion to the x-height compared to &quot;deliberative&quot; reading. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Which is why most people think any old font is fine for any setting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->** This is why typos are missed more in high-speed reading. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the optimal x-height for a given situation depends on the point it's at between pure legibility and pure readability. Take the case of a newspaper: because it's disposable, the paper is cheap, the point sizes are small; and then there's the fact that newspapers are often read while in motion, and in poor/variable lighting. All these things combine to make a good newspaper font to have a large x-height. But if you look at a book, it's read in much longer stints, in much more controlled environments, with less regard for economy; so a book face should have more generous extenders because more of  such reading is done &quot;immersively&quot;, so the outlines of words are more important than their &quot;brute&quot; size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the greater usage of sans in magazines, I suspect it's a cultural thing, not something driven by functionality, because serif fonts are more readable (nominally) for any decent amount of text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Is that what you mean?).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should you not find what you are looking for, you could try and contact him, I guess.
