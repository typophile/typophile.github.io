  5.0.4 for Mac, I can't click on the metrics window tools menu (the one that has
  'Open AFM, save, measurement line buttons, etc). I can click on these, excpet I
  cannot click on the class kerning button (the one where you select if you want the
  metrics window to show class kerning, or kerning with key pairs only, etc). It's
  stuck on not showing class kerning - and I need to see them all :D\r\n\r\nSo anoying,
  the button is there, it's not greyed or whatever, but nothing happens on click\u2026\r\n\r\nReinstalling
  didn't help at all\u2026\r\n\r\nAny help?\r\n\r\nMaybe a low instruction to fontlab
  to set this?\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI seem to be having the same problem (I\u2019m new to Fontlab
    so apologies if I\u2019m making a stupid mistake). The drop down menu for Class
    Kerning in the Metrics window will not work. Not sure what a plist file is or
    where to find it. Have checked back over previously saved versions and it doesn\u2019t
    seem to work anywhere. Has anyone else come across this problem? Any help would
    be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve"
