    my office-mates got me to read the following aloud:\r\n\r\nI am Sofa King \r\nWe
    Todd did.\r\n\r\nWhen I said what does it mean? Trying to contain their glee,
    they said I needed to say it louder. So I did. When the puzzled look on my face
    indicated I still was clueless, they said I need to almost yell it. I think I
    got it after that. \r\n\r\nNow when I do something stupid, I say \"Way to go,
    Sofa King!\"\r\n\r\n(corrected with Samadam's help below)"

    were).  It is a beautiful site, i love the logo, the navigation style of scrolling
    to the right, the coat of arms, the Citgo, everything. Nice work.\r\n\r\nAnd by
    the way, fontplayer, it would have been better to say:\r\nI am Sofa King\r\n<em>We</em>
    Todd did.\r\nMakes more sense syntactically and sounds better."

    not that you mention it, I think that is what they put, and it makes it easier
    to see how they fooled me (a little)\r\n; )\r\n\r\nOh, and btw, I love the design
    work also."
