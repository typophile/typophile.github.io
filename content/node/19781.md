body: "Get Triva, a new font that is - from what I was able to understand from a Google
  translation- underconstruction and incomplete.\r\nIt looks rather nice though...
  like Cocon but without the exaggerated personality. \r\nFontShop has Trivia ready
  for download in most type formats (including OpenType) until August 2006. It includes
  some not-so-useful dings as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image_3817.php3.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image-1_4777.php3.jpg]\r\n\r\nwww.fontshop.de/trivia\r\n\r\nAnd
  you might like the US FontFont links too:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/freefonts/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontfont.com/downloads.html\r\n\r\n\r\nHope
  my fellow broke designers like this one,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\nPS... sorry, only
  for non-commercial use guys :-("
