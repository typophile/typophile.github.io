body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a children's poem book. Each poem is about one specific
  animal, \r\nwritten funny,simply and with rhyme. They vary in length but each is
  going to be on it's own page.\r\nThe book is targeted for 5-7 year olds.\r\nNow,
  illustrations are simple and are ment to be colored. There will be around 3 illustrations
  on each page randomly positioned. (illustration type is attached)\r\n\r\nQUESTION:
  Which typeface would be good to use for headlines and which for bodytext that would
  match well with these illustration type?\r\nWhat font size do you think would be
  appropriate for this age group?\r\n(In some books on type they recommend even 16pt
  type size for this age group)\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/animals_4225.jpg]"

    or <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033\">Archer</a>
    without them overpowering the illos. On the other hand, something simple, such
    as <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html\">Bryant</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/omnes\">Omnes</a> might be
    nice too."

    a lighter weight for heads that matched, depending on the scale, the line weight
    of the illustrations? Archer seems like a good candidate, as mentioned.\r\n"
