  serif face to work together with [[http://www.linotype.com/145592/Alisal-family.html|Alisal]]
  as the main text face? The book is a collection of science fiction stories about
  animals.\r\n\r\nLeo Korogodski\r\nSilverberry Press"

    other project. But I don't think they would fit this one."

  body: "Yes, I've been considering Carter Sans. The same author, and it's strict
    but not without some play about the edges (quite literally; look at the capital
    \"L,\" for example), though not too much. Plus it has the same quadratic dots
    as Alisal.\r\n\r\nBut I wanna see more opinions first. Plus, what would the titling
    font be?"
