<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, <br>Ive recently had alot of trouble with panther. I had to make a clean install and create a back up of my work. I forgot to copy my atm control panel. (the original installer is long gone) and now i cant get atm deluxe to work properly. it says to make sure i have atm in the control panel and that it is ON in the preference dialog. <br>How could i get another ATM control panel, and is this the problem. I just copied the application folder. <br>I have the atm preferences and manager sets in the preferences folder. <br> <br>Thanks for any help.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Grant, <br>Thanks for the reply and offer of help but ive since realised the control panel has little to do with this. <br>Im having huge trouble with my laptop and its quite scary because ive alot of work to do and since ive gotton panther its lost control. <br>Ill explain it all because im hoping somebody can give some advice that may help fix this. I firstly installed panther, upgrade, then anytime i tryed open an application it said "unexpectedly quit". I had to erase the disk and make a clean install. I also installed 9.2, for quark. when i tryed organising fonts with fontbook, the machine got alot slower. When I would try open font book the rainbow spiral just kept spinning. iCal was the same and when i tryed to click "accounts" in the preferences window. I went to an apple place they just got me to install panther again, gave me new discs and it all seemed ok again until i tryed sort my fonts and it all happened again. <br>Another clean install later. Trying to forget about fontbook, i just put my essential fonts in harddrive/library/fonts then the computer wouldnt start the same spiral on the desktop waiting for the folders to dissapear. Ive since started up on my os 9 cd and removed the fonts from the library and it all works fine. <br>Has anyone an idea why? <br>and is there a problem with putting too many fonts in the library, i put about 50. would it be safer to put the fonts in the application fonts folder. the laptop is an ibook about 1.5 years old. <br>Thanks for any help, <br>david.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A friend of mine had issues with speed and hanging after moving fonts into Font Book. You might want to read about his plight and how he managed to get things working again. It may help. <br> <br><a href=http://www.cacomixl.com/blog/2003_11_01_archive.html#106833576659861355 target=_blank>http://www.cacomixl.com/blog/2003_11_01_archive.html#106833576659861355</a> <br> <br> I have yet to migrate to Panther, but I'll probably keep using SuitCase XI rather than Font Book, seeing as I have several thousand typefaces to manage. As far as I'm concerned, Font Book ain't ready for large-scale prime time type libraries.</div>

<div class=commentbody>grant your a star, thanks ill read this now, i figure the best thing to do is just put the fonts in the library when i start and delete them when im finished. im ready to throw this thing out the window.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Regardless of what else is going on, I'll note that ATM Deluxe is officially *not* compatible with OS X. (ATM Light can still be run in Classic, and is pretty useful there.) <br> <br>Some people have reported success using ATM Deluxe in OS X as long as they turn off auto-activation. Of course, it's still a Classic app, so you have to run Classic to run it. But you're taking your chances if you choose to go this route. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T <br> <br>Thomas Phinney <br>Fonts Program Mgr. <br>Adobe Systems</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have to admit that I do run ATMD in Classic - mind you, not for font management as Thomas mentions above - but for sample printing. The type index and sample templates built into SuitCase are teetering on this side of atrocious. (ATMD is active for cross-OS compatibility testing too, of course.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>What bothers me, is Panther is less than a month old and they already had an update 10.3.1, not a good sign. To manage fonts I use Font Reserve, it works with OS 10. Dan</div>

<div class=commentbody>><i>What bothers me, is Panther is less than a month old</i> <br>><i>and they already had an update 10.3.1, not a good sign.</i> <br> <br>I don't find that a bad sign. I find that comforting. Any software manufacturer (Apple, Microsoft, whomever...) that can identify serious issues and patch them within a week of a major release is on the ball in my book. Yes, it would have been better if the issues had been caught prior to the release of Panther, but we're talking about a massive ball consisting of several thousand chunks of code and individual programs which make up an operating system. Given the complexity of the end product, I'm impressed they were able to release 10.3.1 as quickly as they did. You don't often see an Adobe or a Macromedia fixing issues that fast.</div>
