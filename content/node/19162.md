body: "Hi, This may not be strictly a Type ID board question, but I was told this
  is a sample of PostSerif by Richard Lipton from 1998, for Font Bureau. Maybe associated
  with the National Post (newspaper?). I Googled these key words and was not able
  to find confirmation. Does anyone know if there is an italic face for this family?
  I found something that talked about versions of FB Miller being done for the National
  Post, and I wonder if this is another name for Miller Condensed.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know about this typeface?"

    had recently. It looks like it lets me attach it, but nothing shows up. I sized
    it to 550 pixels wide, and it's a .gif file, so I don't know why it's not working.\r\n\r\n-

    which also has an italic.

  body: "Yes, there are similarities, but it may be because both are based on a Scotch
    Roman model. There are differences too, such as the 'k'. Thanks for taking a look
    Tiff.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Hmm. Didn't test the K. The R isn't quite the same either. I've just emailed
    Robb to see if he can clarify anything.

    the provenance of the font?\r\n\r\nwww.lacavadesign.ca"

  body: "I tried following the Lacava & 'National Post' leads and seemed to find reinforcement
    that the main serif font for that paper was Matthew Carter's 'Miller' for Font
    Bureau. Seems that Lacava has collaborated with Font Bureau a number of times,
    but I cannot link Richard Lipton with Lacava Design, or the National Post design.\r\n\r\nThanks
    Marc, that was a good lead. I must admit I never heard of Lacava Design, but she's
    been involved in many newspaper makeovers.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think I can close this one out with a reply I received from Harry Parker
    of Font Bureau. He said that they did indeed design Post Serif for the National
    Post newspaper in 1999, and that it was done in four weights: Light, Roman, Bold
    and Bold Condensed (notice no italics). He said that they also licensed several
    cuts of Miller to the Post, both before and after the work on Post Serif. The
    Miller versions were mostly for display type, he said.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
