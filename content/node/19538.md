  - \r\n\r\nWhat I really love about this typeface is \r\n\r\n*) its 'A' - very cool,
  clean- the straight line, the leg that breaks away and creates the great negative
  space with the 'P' \r\n\r\n*)I love the counter in the 'P' as well -very future-y\r\n\r\n*)
  the weight - very meaty - science-y\r\n\r\nMy request is to get help iding this
  here impact rt - and to get recommendations for other typefaces like it!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nMarko"
