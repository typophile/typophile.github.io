body: "Hello there. \r\n\r\nWell I've designed this logo for an Architecture firm
  in Maldives. Its pretty simple. Its actually a small floor plan with a door cut
  out to let the type in. \r\n\r\nSince the main logo type is DINPro with a modified
  tittle, I am looking for a secondary typeface to work on body text and others. I
  took DINPro for it legibility and geometry. Finally wreaking my self over the secondary
  type face I've finally decided to use Proxima Nova.\r\n\r\nIs this combination too
  similar? or too boring? Any suggestions is welcome.\r\n\r\nI've attached the logo
  and example type combination.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5178.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Type_5643.png]"

  body: "(Warning: Amateur Opinion)\r\n\r\nI like the type, but I'm wondering whether
    the \"door\" wouldn't look better if it were exactly the size of the main type,
    thus generating a \"sublime\" illusionary structure extending across the floorplan.\r\n\r\nTittle
    could be just a bit heavier?"

  body: "Hi Catharsis, the original draft did have the \"door\" as the same size of
    the main type. It made the main type look bigger then the \"door\" so to I had
    to adjust it optically and increased the size as it is now. Tittle size is actually
    calculated using the shifted baseline of U C S characters of DINPro to make it
    as natural as possible based on the typeface.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw your reply I noticed
    that DINPro actually looks shorter in height then Proxima Nova. The more I look
    at it the more I think it is a perfect combination, but it would definitely need
    some tiny increments in height of DINPro to make it work. \r\n\r\nWhat do you
    think?"

    congrats you just drew up a prison cell. No? How about a shipping container ..
    they're kinda trendy these days.\r\n\r\nErgo... Sublime Architects will put you
    in a container ...nice.\r\n\r\nSeriously, nothing sublime about that.\r\n\r\nFont
    selection is the least of your worries.\r\n\r\nn."

  body: i get a bit lost when i look at it, my eyes keep going to the "box" and ignore
    the text, maybe if do a thinner line or give a bit of room the text to breathe.
    i think you should go all in with the DIN and the weights that it has, the secundary
    type you choose is very similar, kinda boring.

  body: "DIN Pro... damn, $95 per weight\r\n\r\n(edit) I too think the logo is not
    really working. For one, the /i/ drags the focus to the second syllabus and it
    makes the logo read LIME. For two, the framing - I realize it is meant to be a
    reference to a floor plan (or something along these lines), but it is just too
    damn heavy and it looks more like an obituary frame. Perhaps using the color would
    lessen the association, but the main problem is that the whole design is just
    too heavy and imposing for something that has Sublime in its name."

  body: "Agree with the others, DINPro and Proxima Nova are very similar, pick one
    and use its various weights.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with zevbiz, the kerning needs
    some attention, particularly the 'li' in Sublime, which is almost looking like
    it says 'Subl ime', and the 'cts' in architects, which look slightly looser than
    the preceding characters.\r\n\r\nOne final suggestion, perhaps try the logo with
    an actual door half open in the plan? Might make it more obvious as to what the
    logo is. Your call.\r\n\r\nhth"
