  body: I read this in the International Herald Tribune this morning! Cool article,
    but not very type related.

  body: "I grew up in <em>a</em> world where things were just things. I never thought
    of definite or indefinite articles, because the context of <em>a</em> thing was
    always clear. And then I started to learn English.\r\nToday, me, and thousands
    of other younger Poles, speak \"<em>this</em> water is too cold\" or \"take <em>any</em>
    pen\" which are subconscious cliches of English use of \"the\" and \"a\". We have
    adapted <em>a</em> different point of view."

  body: "There was a link to the New York Times article from the original page noted,
    and I found that quite interesting. Old ideas about Italian being musical and
    German rough had much less to do with the book than the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAs
    I find it easier to keep compass points straight than left and right, which just
    seem so identical, I could relate to the exotic linguistic example they used for
    much of the article."

  body: I have observed, when looking at various translations of instructions included
    with some gizmo, that Italian seems to be the briefest and Spanish and German
    seem to ne vying for the longest. Perhaps this has to do with what is expected
    to be implicit or explicit; or, maybe not.
