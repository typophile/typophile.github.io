  are your thoughts on this type of typography? All capital on everything.\r\nAnd
  why do you think this is so popular?\r\nMy answer is,\r\n I think this is popular
  because its an easier way to  make decent looking typography. \r\n"

    suggests the darkness of a hole, sucking the consumer in.\r\n\r\nAnd not, for
    instance, because it's been the default for 500 years.\r\n\r\nAnd capitals were
    the default long before that. Has there ever been a time when capitals were out
    of favor? And are they really, now, more popular than u&lc? I doubt it."

  body: "That\u2019s the cover of a book which reproduces ads from the 1960s at 100%,
    so it would be around 8\xBD\" x 11\".\r\nThe kerning is in proportion to the size
    of type.\r\nIt was published in 1984, just about the end of the Tight-But-Not-Touching
    era.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960s, American ad copy was written in a (feigned) friendly,
    second person singular, conversational style.\r\nHeadlines were set as if they
    were blow-ups of body text, to continue that casual, informal theme.\r\nSo: paragraph
    indent, \uFB02ush left, upper and lower case, like this from 1965:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images65marlboro_4779.jpg]\r\nThe
    asymmetric shapes made by the text blocks are positioned dynamically in the layout,
    balanced against negative space, in the high modernist manner, creating a \uFB02at
    \u201Cabstract\u201D graphic on the surface of the page.\r\nIn comparison, all
    cap headlines are bossy and authoritative.\r\nEasier to create a super\uFB01cially
    neat effect, but lacking the sophistication of the \u201960s."

  body: Do you think the way graphic designer's see typography is different from how
    typographers see typography? I think the ALL CAPS style is mostly done by graphic
    designers because they see the groups of words as rectangles and it looks neat.
    While typographers see typography more like language that is typesetted so it
    wouldn't make sense to make everything ALL CAPS.

    Maybe there is a lesson here: are you a better designer if you can do good work

    people read, they don't decode the text one letter at a time; they decode words,
    which they recognize by the distinctive contours formed by the ascenders and descenders.
    If I have copy that I really want my readers to decode (<em>Here's why my client's

    serve less to convey information, and more as a badge or banner, I'm more apt

    was a culture of this style, with subtleties that this ad plays to.\r\nThe orphans
    are intentional, creating dramatically asymmetric paragraph shapes which may be
    manipulated as part of the overall \uFB02at graphic, in a way that \uFB01lled-out
    paragraphs don\u2019t.\r\nIn particular in this ad, which is all about vertical
    \uFB02ow (rif\uFB01ng off the condensed type style of the brand name), \u201Cis\u201D
    reads straight down to the adjacent \u201CCome\u201D, requiring no disruptive
    eye backtrack (regressive saccade?)\r\nContinuing the \uFB02ow, the absence of
    a \uFB01nal period references newspaper style, easing the reader\u2019s passage

    10pt Avant Garde and letterspaced to fill the line. There is a full-width bar
    a line height or two below and right underneath that comes the identifier flush
    right in ca. 24pt Palatino. Reckon you can see it for yourselves if you snag one
    from Bitsavers or one of their mirror.
