    The given names are the widths. I have no problem with the overlap. And since
    you can't trademark given names..."

    beautiful.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see some italics in the future."

    you''re a multiple master maven, but I wondering if you used any other software,
    like superpolator, or font remix tools? '

  body: "While I have a licensed copy of ReMix tools, and find them very impressive,
    the Yo series was created in FontLab with no other tools. Only FontLab's MM interface
    with four drawn instances. On the website I talk about originally wanting to create
    520 fonts organized in 26 widths, and I'm only half kidding. It's amazing to see
    how a slight difference in the width axis would yield a very different feeling
    design.\r\n"

  body: Yeah, I typed that quickly... I didn't really mean "interpretation" per se.
    Sorry about that. These are much more elegant, in my opinion, and more thought-out
    than Pistilli. I love the weight-range.

    is a problem with my browser (firefox) or the site. It's a shame though, as this
    sounds really nice.

  body: "@William: The high Didone contrast of Yo makes it well suited to doing an
    extreme range of weights and widths in straight FontLab MM space, without resort
    to Superpolator or other add-ons. Try the same dynamic range with a fairly low-contrast
    design and you'll start needing something else to help out.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    but I think the general idea is clear enough.
