  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>An upgrade to Tiger was the straw that broke Suitcase&rsquo;s back for me. It wouldn&rsquo;t render common fonts in my browser, took forever to activate a font, and finally locked up my machine. I&rsquo;ve been giving FontAgent Pro a try and, though I don&rsquo;t love its interface, it has not caused me any problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I walked away from Suitcase, I also had to walk away from the font sets that I created for it. I spent many hours sorting thousands of fonts into sets according to (my best assessment of) their general category &ndash; slab serif, gothic, geometric, symbol, script, etc. This upfront work paid off every time I went to the well to make a new font choice. All this got me thinking&hellip;</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t font files include meta-data that specifies their category?! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Or how about a database of fonts and categories to which font management programs could automatically connect, as iTunes does with CDDB to identify tracks on a newly imported CD? Pipe dream? Or maybe I could create this myself and make thousands of dollars?!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bert is correct. It&rsquo;s not a new idea. But Panose is outdated, relatively archaic, and only works for text faces. I can see how a new system with a free online database hookup could be killer.</p>
<p>It is possible, btw, to input Panose values in FontLab and other font creation software, but few do it.</p>

<p>Thomas, is Font Reserve good at this task? I would imagine that its database would have to be huge and very current to be of much use. I would gladly convert if it performs that task well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I tackled Panose properly for the first time last year, for the MS ClearType Font Collection. It isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing in the world, so I&rsquo;m not surprised that few font developers take the time to do it properly. And it does need to be done properly: you can&rsquo;t cheat with the Panose system and, especially, you must not make guesses about the correct values based on interpreting the Panose classification terminology. The terminology used by Panose is largely unrelated to the ways in which similar terms are used by most typographers and type designers; I&rsquo;m not sure why, and I think it would have been better if Panose had stuck to a purely numerical system and avoided &lsquo;descriptive&rsquo; terms completely. Panose is based on careful measurement of various aspects of key glyphs in a typeface, and calculations based on those measurements. Sometimes, the resulting values may correspond to Panose descriptive terms that are not at all how you would describe your typeface, but it is the values that are important to the whole Panose idea, not the terms.</div>
