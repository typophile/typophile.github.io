  for almost two decades:\r\n\r\nif the only way I can verify a typeface is right
  for a given book is to set the much of the book with it and hone/adjust/print/dicker/tweak,
  how am I to do so if I don't own the typeface?\r\n\r\nRuse, for example. I've wanted
  to try it for years.\r\n\r\nCan someone develop software that will allow a typeface
  to exist on my computer just for a day?"

    that come with software that are either what you may ultimately want to use or
    similar, testing should not be a problem.\r\n\r\nToo, look for a book set in something
    you may think will work for you and look at it."

  body: There are various foundries which offer demo fonts of their catalogs, and
    now there are also cloud-based solutions. But, of course, ultimately it depends
    on the foundry.

    they don\u2019t have everything, but they have a lot.\r\n\r\nOne thing I\u2019ve
    done is when I\u2019m really, really getting to a point of wanting to see a font
    in my layouts (and the available specimen PDFs etc aren\u2019t enough) is to buy
    just the regular weight. Usually that\u2019s not too much of an investment (OK,
    Ruse might be an exception to that rule :) ), and even if it turns out not to
    be right, you still might be able to use it for something else down the road.\r\n\r\nBut
    also, talk to people. I\u2019ve found that quite a few foundries actually will
    let you test fonts for free if they believe you\u2019re not going to just steal
    them."

    an online tool for it, if I recall correctly).
