body: "So ladies and gents, I'm working at a company that is pretty much just forming
  an in-house design department. I have a few questions that I'm hoping to find answers
  to. \r\n\r\n1) How much is a reasonable target price to get a design firm up and
  running? We have virtually NO purchased typefaces, most are system fonts.\r\n\r\n2)
  What are some of the best valued combined packages that contain multiple typefaces?
  I need the classics too (I can't live without Univers.)\r\n\r\n3) I also need some
  more modern typefaces to keep things fresh, any suggestions on more modern packages?
  (I also can't live without the Thesis Family.) \r\n\r\n4) How do I convince my company
  that after taking the huge hit financially in purchasing a \"classics\" package
  that modern typefaces also need to be part of the budget?\r\n\r\nI'm hoping a few
  of you might be able to point in the right direction. I know the subject of price
  is a touchy subject so if you'd rather not discuss it in a public forum please e-mail
  through the link on Typophile or at the e-mail address listed on my site. Thanks
  all! "

    What type of company would decide they want to set up an \"in-house\" design department,
    that would need to be stocked with a wide range of typefaces? \r\n\r\nMost companies
    I've had experience with set up an in-house design department so that they can
    remove or reduce their dependency on the outside design firms they use. Either
    they want to do everything in house or they want to do the grunt work in-house
    to cut out the middle-man's markup. Either way they\u2019d normally start with
    the fonts their existing design resources are using and then acquire additional
    fonts as the need arises. But maybe I\u2019m missing something?  \r\n"

    don't know about stealing, but paying for a font that you've decided to use after
    being able to experiment with it would make a lot of sense. Foundries should have
    a \"try & buy\" proposition -- you're free to play with their fonts, but have
    to pay for the ones you use in designs that you sell (or give away). Isn't there

    I agree with you that enforcing licensing policies is a nightmare, but there really
    isn't much a foundry can do if someone decides to download one of their multi-thousand
    dollar packages without paying anything. I mean, it's as simple as running a Google
    search with the words <code>font folio 10 torrent</code> and then using a torrent
    client to download the stuff.\r\n\r\nIn the end, all this discussion about licensing
    -- whether or not a EULA allows for the fonts to be installed on one, two, five,
    or more machines; whether a PS1 font can be converted into an OT font; etc --
    is really a matter of trusting that some people will respect the licence. What
    are you going to do if someone doesn't? Ever heard of a foundry getting a warrant
    to check whether one of their fonts is being used on eight computers instead of
    the allowable five? Or to make sure that the client is not using an OpenType font
    they created from the PS1 font originally purchased?\r\n\r\nMy point is, in the
    real world foundries <em>have</em> to trust their paying customers, because it's
    just so easy to obtain their fonts for free from illegal sources anyway. And if
    it's all a matter of trust, why not go the \"try & buy\" way?\r\n\r\n(I'm afraid
    we're straying further and further from the original topic, but it's my fault.)"
