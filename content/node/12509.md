  for mobile phones. These will be images, so they can utilize multiple colours, which
  will be useful for anti-aliasing or simulated anti-aliasing.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have experience designing type for mobile phones, or any thoughts which I should
  consider for this project?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Thanks Tif!\r\n\r\nHand-anti-aliased fonts give the best results onscreen,
    but they're rarely used, so you have a great opportunity here. There are some
    interesting differences between designing hand-made grayscale versus hand-made
    1-bit, as well as between hand-made grayscale versus outline fonts - differences
    that are not obvious, so they are best grasped when experienced.\r\n\r\nOne approach
    is to simply add some gray pixels to an existing 1-bit bitmapfont - but that's
    cheap. Leveraging real Gray Power will put your results on a higher level, but
    it requires a delicate, even precarious balance between three things: letterform
    fidelity, crispness, and even color. It's harder than it might first seem, especially
    when you factor in platform gamma differences (which luckly in your case doesn't
    apply). I remember one Typophile member who started enthusiastically but later
    decided to give up... This almost happened to me too, but fortunately I had many
    years from when I started until the time it was actually possible to deliver such
    fonts for use by others.\r\n\r\nIf you want the experience, and aren't worried
    about spending too much time on it, do give it a shot. But if you decide you need
    help, you can either commission somebody with experience to do it, or you could
    license an existing family (like Mana*) from Ultrafonts.com, the best source for
    grayscale pixelfonts. Good luck.\r\n\r\n* Which will have an 11-pixel size soon,
    and a 9 afterwards.\r\n\r\nBTW, I see you're in Whittier - I'm in Glendale!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
