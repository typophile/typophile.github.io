  \r\n\r\nHeres another round, looking at some colour. Any suggestions or hatred would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nA quick overview. . . fakeshift identity
  for an upscale restaurant and private lounge in Walnut Creek, CA. Hard to sort of
  pin an indentity to a bar / lounge because most of the image can come from the interior
  decoration, but I wanted a mix of modern and elegant upscale. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "I like this. Just a couple of comments:\r\n\r\nThe '1' seems just a little
    too thick.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd put another copy of \"Two Twelve\" on top of the mark,
    rotated 180 degrees to mirror the rotation of the last '2'.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    colours, I think the options with higher contrast work best (1,2,5,6), but I do
    dig the blue-grey in option 3.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "i agree with Lex that the 1 seems too thick.\r\n\r\ni also think that'd be
    really cool to put TWO TWELVE above the mark, upside down. very neat idea, Lex.\r\n\r\nas
    for me though, i don't think the type choice works with the mark. to me they each
    speak a different style, and are not harmonizing. i'd rather see either a condensed
    serif or a thin sans-serif. and i'm leaning towards the sans-serif in my mind.
    \r\n\r\nor even a lowercase hand-drawn script could be nice. the 212 has an up-scale
    elegant look to it, and hand-drawn scripts usually represent that because it takes
    time to do. it's easy and cheap to just type out the words in Didot.\r\n\r\nfor
    color, i prefer the top left and bottom right. it's simple and the color works
    well. for multiple colors, i like the top right one; the low-contrast tan on tan
    and gray blue are very nice. i'm not digging the yellow/maroon combo at all, but
    i do like where it's trying to go - it seems different, unique, and that's just
    what bars want."

  body: Maybe this was said in the earlier thread where you posted the roughs, but
    I read the numbers as 21 2 (twenty-one two), which kinda conflicts with the text
    beneath it.

    sans.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scriven_Wordmark_Final_4010.jpg]"

  body: "Now the '1' looks too thin! It could just be the anti-aliasing. I think either
    the Futura Condensed or the original (Bodoni?) look the best.\r\n\r\nI do like
    2A, and these colours look nice. 2B is a little too \"Starbucks\" for my taste,
    and 2C looks upscale, but in a senior citizen sort of way.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "the work you did b4 was more intelligent than this one.. but anyway, i think
    there is a problem in 212 typeface: it is not elegant and doesn't work with the
    fonts u r trying with... but the best two fonts to choose from are in the last
    box...\r\ngood luck\r\ni forgot to tell u that the colors are verrry dullllll..
    try to give em life"
