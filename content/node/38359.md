body: I thought that as they are both System fonts developed by Microsoft that they
  would be ideal for use within Office programs such as Word, PowerPoint etc. I understand
  that they were both developed for web use. Can someone explain to me why they appear
  less than ideal in such an Office application as PowerPoint? Something to do with
  hinting? Would be grateful to understand the details...

    Only the Windows version of Powerpoint will allow you to embed fonts, the Mac
    version will let you use them on your machine but once you export for another
    machine  you lose that.

  body: My WAG, which is worth you-know-what, is that web fonts are designed to have
    larger X-heights, heavier outlines, wider spacing, and "bolder bolds" than other
    fonts -- see [[http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm|this]], for example
    -- and when you use them at more than 14 points or so, they appear bloated (for
    lack of a better word). At least that's my impression. I just did a quick test
    in PowerPoint at 24 points, and Georgia, Verdana, and Trebuchet all look better
    to me in regular face than bold.
