  are the initial ideas hashed out a bit.  I like the flag from the original, and
  just thought it needed some tightening up.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n"

  body: "Thanks so much Sharon, Paul, & Lex!  Glad to have any feedback.\r\nIt's \"six-of-one,
    half-dozen of the other\" for me... but I would like to make a decent departure
    from the original and go with the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/logotype-explorations-v2.gif\">bottom-left
    on v2</a>, or either on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/logotype-explorations-v2b.gif\">top
    at v2b</a>.\r\n\r\nThe fonts are Union, Demos Bold, and FF Clan.  Maybe switch
    the FF Clan to Praxis Bold... then fiddle 'til it looks good.\r\n\r\nWrapping
    the \"flag stripes on a globe\" (US Government... travel... get it?) was the idea
    for the spherical treatment of the mark in v2b, without making it look like a
    barber-shop pole.  Though users saying \"<em>even their logo is a lemon!</em>\"
    would be bad too -- as they're getting hammered on usability of the site (that's
    the next task).\r\n\r\nI could even <a href=\"http://www.logolounge.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=638\">animate
    that globe</a>, but I'm trying to be somewhat simple and classical and <a href=\"http://www.logolounge.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=607\">not
    trendy</a>."

  body: I really like the bottom left v2, I think it is a very strong mark that says
    "Government" to me. The type as well as the flag work very well together. The
    color is also nice, although Red & Government seem kind of scary together. My
    first instinct is that it should be green or blue, but I really like the red.
