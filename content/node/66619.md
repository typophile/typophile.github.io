    called them jerseys, tho."

    easy if you don't have a team.\r\nThe Leafs are doing it the hard way."

    shirt does look fake :-)

  body: I have to admit to nostalgia for the old Canucks sweater shown on the ugliest
    jersey site to which Si linked. It made the entire team look like extras in a
    Buck Rogers episode.

  body: "There is indeed no unanimity in Canadian English about <i>hockey jersey</i>
    (cf. \u201Cthird jersey\u201D) vs. <i>hockey sweater</i> (cf. classic animated
    short film <cite>The Sweater</cite>). I think material of construction is important.
    Classic Canadiens jerseys are really sweaters. 1990s Phoenix Coyotes sweaters,
    which were an absolutely amazing example of 3D graphic design, were really jerseys."
