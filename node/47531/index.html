		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s a good thing you interpreted the words, because I thought at first that the letters were COMA UNMO :)</p>
<p>This lettering was certainly done by hand based on Mediaeval models, perhaps copied from European churches.</p>
<p>Surveying fonts for similar styles, I see none with a C like this, an E this closed off, or a T quite that extreme, but CastleType&rsquo;s [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/goudy-lombardy/|&ldquo;Goudy Lombardy&rdquo;]] comes rather close, though it&rsquo;s M is the wrong style. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/faust-text/|Faust Text]] from Dan Solo is perhaps the best overall font to match the feel of your lettering, but the details are not very close in any font I saw. Other fonts (which I did not provide links for) are Elizabeth, Barbara Sisters, Agedage Simple Versal, Blackmoor, Cranach and Kardanal. They all have many basic resemblances, but also differences in many details, in just these 8 letters you gave us.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Perhaps seeing the whole verse would help.  At the time of the renovation Springfield had two Lutheran churches and Trinity was know locally as the &ldquo;German&rdquo; church.  German church services were held weekly up until the 1950&rsquo;s.  There is a lot of documentation (in german) for the numerous wood carvings in the church but nothing on this verse.  The verse is carved into a wood panel and painted red.  It has been suggested that this font was used in some of the first hand written English religious documents, pre-Gutenberg, but this truly is just speculation.  The first three words are 1-1/2 ft. and the rest are 1 ft tall.</p>
<p>I hope the addition information is helpful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I believe you&rsquo;re right that this would be pre-Gutenberg, because Daniel Updike&rsquo;s books on &ldquo;Printing Types - Their History and Use&rdquo; do not show any 15th century printing types that look like this, anywhere in Europe, as far as I could find. Someone with books about early European manuscripts would need to help us out to see if this has a name, but, since it was most probably hand-drawn, that seems unlikely. Lettering in those manuscripts that I have seen are generally described by their place of origin, or the name of the friar who made the book.</p>
<p>You used the term &lsquo;font&rsquo;, but &lsquo;alphabet&rsquo; seems more appropriate, because I don&rsquo;t think the term font (or fount) was used before moveable type was created.</p>
<p>If anyone digitized anything from such ancient sources, it might be David Nalle&rsquo;s [[http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/medieval/|Scriptorium]], and Aneirin (mentioned above) is in his collection. That seems to be his closest font to your lettering. He also has [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/formidable/|Formidable]], which has a number of similar letters. I still think Faust Text is the nearest approximation I have seen. [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm|Dieter Steffmann]]&rsquo;s collection might also have something from this era, but you need to click your way through it to find out.</p>
