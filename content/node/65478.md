body: "So tomorrow is the last day of the fall semester and sometime in the evening
  I'll take my flight back home to Rancho Cucamonga, California to spend the break
  with my family. \r\n\r\nThis past week I have my hands on a copy of FontLab and
  am excited to get underway with my first chance at creating some typography.  I've
  managed to dig up  a huge 18x24 binder of graph paper that I never new what to use
  for until now.  \r\n\r\nOne of my current projects for the break will be to do an
  alteration on an existing type face as a chance to get comfortable with the program
  and get a better understanding of type design in general.  Being a fan of the Modern
  Typefaces and the style of Giambattista Bodoni and Firmin Didot, I'll probably spend
  the next three weeks, examining, sketching down alterations, and just practicing
  with FontLab. My typography courses don't do enough to teach us the basics of designing
  typefaces beyond the basic anatomy of some history of typography, so I figure it's
  best to try and take some of the initiative into my own hands. \r\n\r\nHere's to
  a happy holiday. "
