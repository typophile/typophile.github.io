body: "One of the first type designs I made was done during my exchange study in Finland,
  almost ten years ago. It was inspired by the Finnish traffic sign type and covered
  only one font. Now I reworked and expanded it to a family, including a extremely

  There is also a [[http://www.ludwiguebele.de/elements/fontPDF/53/fontPDF.pdf|PDF]]
  available.\r\nHope you like it. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helsinki_6039.jpg]"
