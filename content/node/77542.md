body: "I was fooling around with a font in InDesign, and noticed that scaling it to
  99% horizontal, 100% vertical gave a better-looking font.\r\n\r\nSo, I opened up
  the font in FontLab, and scaled it 99% horizontal 100 vertical. Then the same thing
  using the new Fontographer. Well, the two font editing programs gave different results,
  and not just in metrics. The differences are slight, as you would expect by such
  a small change, but they are there.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know, or think of a way I
  can test, which gives the same as the InDesign result?"

  body: 'The "InDesign result" is on-screen rendering: the font may look better on-screen
    under a particular set of circumstances, but it does not necessarily follow that
    it will look better in all circumstances by applying this "magic formula." Your
    initial "Eureka" moment may simply have been an instance of harmonious hinting
    or just-so antialiasing...'

  body: "Well, it might have been Nick, but I did make a PDF and print that out. Looked
    better on the 1200 dpi laser printout, too. The real test is a 2400 dpi offset
    press, but I do think it'll pass that one as well.\r\n\r\nThe differences between
    FL and FOG are small, but making this change in a font does mean redoing the ligatures,
    and at least revisiting all the characters, sidebearings, and kerning. I really
    only want to do that once. ('Course I'd really like peace on Earth, too.)\r\n\r\nI
    guess what you're saying  is \"just pick one and work with it . . .\""

  body: Wouldn't printing out both scaled versions of the font in InDesign at 100%-horizontal
    let you compare them with the original-at-99%-horizontal version? Or make PDFs
    and import all three into Illustrator for a more detailed comparison of the outlines.

  body: "We wound up writing an InDesign script that reports the width of a selected
    item (where \"item\" can be a \"glyph\"). Then I made up a font from the Font
    Lab scaling and another from the Fontographer scaling. Using the script to measure
    within InDesign, I got:\r\n\r\nWidth of capital A (in InDesign) using \r\n\r\nInDesign's
    scaling: 5.6805 points,\r\n\r\nFontographer's scaling: 5.7095 points,\r\n\r\nFontLab
    Studio's scaling: 5.6809 points.\r\n\r\nSo, with the limited test, FL5 behaves
    closer to InDesign for horizontal.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nOn to redoing the ligatures
    and kerning."
