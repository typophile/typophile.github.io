  it's not fascist magazine),  and I need to remake the text for a friend. \r\nYou
  talents of typography might give me a hand in finding the name.\r\nI know it's a
  Fraktur gothic geometrical, and I'm looking for a book named \"Fraktur mon amour\"
  if I can find it there.\r\n\r\nI supose that the 'Hitler' word is drawn but what
  I'll looking for is the baseline 'Le filet se Ressere'\r\n\r\nThanks alot\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hitler4_6706.jpg]"
