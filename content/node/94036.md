  the moment I can't find anything. Does anybody have a list of characters that never
  appear at the end of a word (in any Latin language)? I'm making a font with end
  forms for most lower case letters and don't want to clog it up with alternate forms
  of glyphs. IIRC ae and oe never appear at the end of a word. "

    a letter that only turns up in a single language like \u0167 or \u010F. You might
    think you have the rules worked out from looking at dictionary words, but when
    it comes to the names of people and places rules fall apart."

  body: Good point. Probably quicker to just cover all eventualities than to try and
    find out which to leave out anyway.

    they can make up more names of people and places. I met 4 with a cedilla last
    night at a party, (she pronounces it Forsh\xE9)."

    Berlow\u2019s comment), it\u2019s probably not so bad to err on creating more
    glyphs rather than fewer, especially if it will actually be less work. \r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"
