  body: "Nike doesn't need a new logo, and likely never will.\r\n\r\nThat being said,
    it's a pretty cool looking mark, but it doesn't read Nike to me either."

    it's one of the worst briefs I've heard of. Did you choose Nike, or did your lecturer?<br

  body: "Try to understand what the company stands for first.  I understand your type
    study, but if a logo doesn't communicate what a company is about at a first glance
    then you've missed the point.  I don't think it looks like Nike.  It reads Nike,
    but it doesn't feel like Nike.  Hard angles might be the most difficult issue.
    \ Nike doesn't use hard edges.\r\nbest regards,\r\ndaniel"

  body: "To echo Daniel's comment I agree not really \"Nike.\" I see it more as a
    skate shoe logo, which, might work for a Nike rebranding in that field, as Nike
    doesn't really work so well with the anti-establishment skater attitude.\r\n\r\np@rick"

    I think. However, I tried playing with it's letterforms as a part of \"Expressive
    Typography\" back at college. It simply says, I like Nike. Expressing love for
    my favorite brand.\r\n\r\nNot related to this thread but felt like sharing it

  body: "When come to school assignment for redesigning an existing logo, one of the
    rules I apply is never choose a famous brand, unless it has an obvious flaw. \r\n\r\nWhy
    choose a successful band logo (which likely to be designed by a pop-star designer
    with years of impressive portfolio and client has spent millions on the project
    ) then make the student change it? Most of the time it would make them looks stupid
    in comparison and such assignment is not very constructive. (unless it's an assignment
    designed with specific purpose in mind like to challenge the status quo and see
    how far you can push it...)\r\n\r\nIf it's not broken,why fix it?\r\n\r\nThe lecturer
    is the one to be responsible here. Please tell the students in the first place
    what's wrong with the current Nike logo (if you can identify one) and what is
    there to improve? If not how would you judge whether the newly modified version
    by the student is an improvement? \r\n\r\nDesign is about solving problems. How
    would the student learn this process if they can't identify the problems? \r\n\r\nweng"

    isn't involved in and design a visual language around it interpreted through the
    already strong and well-known Nike brand. Web site, print ads, packaging, etc...\r\n\r\nFor
    example, Nike Lumberjacking... What does it look like?"
