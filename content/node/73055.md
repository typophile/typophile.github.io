  for type design?\r\n\r\nI've seen typefaces that use very few curve points to define
  the round parts of letters, and then I've seen other faces with 6 or 10 or 20 points
  on each curve. Wow. When I've tried my own efforts\u2014I usually used a few points
  rather than many\u2014the result was a curved letter that looked like it had little
  blisters or irregularities somewhere along the path, often more than one of those
  little bumps. It's easily seen at medium sizes and looks deplorable at small sizes.
  \r\n\r\nAny ideas? \r\n\r\nDanke, mes amigos\r\n\r\nMichael Brady\r\n"

    the arc segments to form your curves. Keep your control points orthogonal, and
    they will be much easier to control."

    you opening TTFs in a font editor? Often, that seems to result from conversion
    from cubic to quadratic splines.\r\n\r\nI second the advice to keep your control
    points at the vertical and horizontal extrema. Some consistency makes it indeed
    easier to predict how moving points and handles will affect the curve.\r\n\r\nAlso
    worth checking out: Raph Levien's <a href=\"http://www.levien.com/spiro/\">spiro
    library</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.levien.com/phd/thesis.pdf\">thesis on
    curves</a>."
