body: I'm having this problem with the truetype fonts I'm generating using Fontlab
  5.0 in Windows XP. The kerning is missing. I've tested them on Windows in Adobe
  Illustrator CS2, Corel Paint Shop XI and no kerning. On the Mac I tested them in
  Photoshop Elements 3 and the Font Book preview window and opened the ttf file in
  Fontographer 4.7.2 and no kerning. I tried every combination in the options > kerning
  window when generating and nothing works. The kerning is there in the metrics window.
  When I make the truetype font an opentype truetype and create a kerning feature
  it works fine but I don't want this to be an opentype font. The kerning in the postscript
  opentype version works fine in all programs. What could I be doing wrong? - Jess

  body: How long does it typically take to get an answer from fontlab support? Tomorrow
    will be a week. Should I consider generating an opentype truetype instead of a
    basic truetype? If anyone has any opinions on this I would appreciate it very
    much. Anyone else using fontlab 5.0.4 and generating basic truetype fonts with
    kerning? - Jess

    the TTX tool's icon. Open the text file and search for "&lt;kern&gt;", so you
    can at least see if FLS did generate a kern table or not.

  body: 'Fontlab support got back to me and tested my vfb files and had no problems
    with kerning when the truetype were generated so I figured it was my stupidity
    (I assumed this from the start) messing them up. So I tried disabling and enabling
    some things while reading about them in the manual. When Options> Generating Opentype
    & TrueType: Automatically reorder glyphs was disabled my problem was fixed. I''m
    not sure if this was on by default or I accidentally clicked it when messing around.

    and exporting a kern table and generate an OTF/TTF, FLS will shows a dialog urging
    you to reconsider your choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)

  body: That makes sense. PostScript OpenType fonts are never supposed to have a kern
    table. A TTF can have both (indeed, some Microsoft fonts do, in order to provide
    kerning for the OpenType-challenged Office).

  body: "John, not according to what I've been reading here: http://www.typophile.com/node/40041\r\n\r\n\"The
    kern-table kerning is not officially supported by the OpenType specification,
    but I don\u2019t know of any situation where it would actually break anything
    (the principle behind the OpenType font format is that you can put whatever table
    you want into the font, and applications must ignore the tables they cannot process).
    - Adam Twardoch\"\r\n\r\nThis is why I always include a basic kern table in my
    ot ps fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if Adam could go into some detail about what
    the \"automatically reorder glyphs\" does and when you would actually need it
    and why did it mess with my kerning when it was enabled? The manual says:\r\n\r\n\"If
    this option is enabled, FLS will try to reorder glyphs to match the mac cmap encoding
    table. Technically, this is a requirement of the Apple TT specification but it
    is not required on Mac OS X or Windows\"\r\n\r\nWhat would happen to a mac font
    on an older system if the glyphs were not reordered?\r\n\r\n-Jess"

  body: "About glyph order:\r\n\r\nRather then reordering glyphs upon font generation
    (with the option switched on), you could as well order glyphs <em>before</em>,
    and generate fonts with the reorder option switched off.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, it is not
    required that glyph are in some 'standard' order. The single issue with CFF-OT
    fonts whose first hundred or so glyphs are not in 'standard' order only affects
    CFF-OT fonts in OS9: the <em>Euro</em> cannot be accessed through the keyboard.
    Also see http://typophile.com/node/30303 and Thomas Phinney's comments.\r\n\r\n<em>But</em>
    there is one requirement: In CFF-OT fonts, the first glyph must be <em>.notdef</em>.
    And in TT(-OT) fonts, the first four glyphs must be <em>.notdef</em>, <em>.null</em>,
    <em>CR</em> and <em>space</em>, see http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm"

    OpenOffice can't handle flat kerning. Kerning is relativity new to that program

  body: "I recently had the same problem with a new font. I did everything in Fontlab
    that has been mentioned in this thread, and also made sure the kerning was turned
    on in Word. I tried Word 2003 and 2007. Never succeeded in getting MS documents
    to read the kerning. I contacted Microsoft, too. They couldn't figure it out.
    The suggestion I received, from multiple sources, was that it was probably something
    in Word and I should not hold my breath expecting to see it fixed. The kerning
    worked in simpler text apps like Textedit and Notepad, as well as InDesign. My
    approach in kerning had been to set the spacing so the fewest kern pairs were
    needed. I redesigned the spacing in the font to look as good as possible without
    any kerning, then added kerning so it could look a little better in the apps that
    recognized it. This is not a economical an approach, but it made the font look
    better in Word.\r\nJuliet"

    Eventually I've fixed it. In case it's any use to others, I read somewhere that
    the OpenType kerning feature only works if there is some other OpenType feature
    defined. So I've put in a quick liga feature and hey presto, kerning now works
    in Adobe apps when exporting the .otf.

  body: "Yes, older Adobe applications check for the presence of a \"GSUB\" table
    only to enable OpenType Layout. Kerning is present in the \"GPOS\" table, but
    it is ignored unless a \"GSUB\" table is present. Any OpenType Layout feature
    that performs substitutions (such as \"liga\" for ligatures) will create a \"GSUB\"
    table, and then kerning will work as well. \r\n\r\nThis is a bug and I believe
    it has been fixed in newest Adobe apps (CS4). \r\n\r\nNote that this only applies
    to OpenType kerning done through the \"kern\" feature. Old-style kerning can be
    placed in the font file as well through the \"kern\" table. FontLab Studio allows
    you to control (in Preferences) whether to put both kinds of kerning, just one
    or none. Note that while OpenType \"kern\" feature kerning allows the use of classes,
    old-style \"kern\" table kerning only allows a flat pair list. So FontLab Studio
    allows you to decide how class kerning should be converted into flat kerning,
    i.e. whether all class kerns should be expanded into a flat table (which may result
    in a very long list if your font has many glyphs, which may overload some old
    applications such as QuarkXPress 4 or PageMaker), or if the old-style flat kerning
    should be a subset of the class kerning. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
