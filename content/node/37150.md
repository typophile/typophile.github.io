  body: "I searched Part 11(Everyday hand-printing fonts) of the Script Guide, and
    didn't find this font, so the alternatives are useful. As we have often noted,
    this style of font is very common and easily made. It's best if quick searches
    don't find it to just pick a similar style and go with that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
