  body: font 1 - I'd guess is not a font at all. note how the repeating characters
    do not match.

    body: No, I'm sure these are fonts. Does anyone else know what these two fonts
      possibly could be?

  body: The second one may be a font, enhanced with flourishes on the d's. But what
    makes you 'sure' that the first is a font? It's highly unlikely that any font
    would have three D's that are so similar but not identical.   - Herb

      the swashes on the letters at least the basic structure to work off of. Any

  body: don't believe that's a font either. again, none of the curls match and the
    slants of the characters all seem to differ.
