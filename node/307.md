body: 'The other day I ran into a somewhat interesting -and apparently very Swedish-
  magazine called &#34;EFX Art &amp; Design&#34;. The current issue &#40;V9 #37, Winter
  2003&#41; is dubbed &#34;Typo &amp; Archi Special&#34;, and it contains some interesting
  examples of 3-D and otherwise colorful fonts. Not exactly my own cup of Gevalia,
  but definitely worth the look. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
