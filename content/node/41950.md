  well as the body copy.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gensler.com/#expertise\r\n\r\nI'm thinking
  the identity may have been a bit customized. \r\n\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n"

    The logo looks customized, perhaps from a Martin Majoor face, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Gensler identity isn't Kievit though. At least what I see has a different
    G. The 'e' is too open for the usual suspects (Helvetica/Univers/Akzidenz), and
    the G is wrong for Arial and Myriad. If there was a Letter Gothic Black it would
    be closer. Still looking..\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I agree with Lex. It is Kievit with an alternative G for the logo.

  body: "Mike the Slate is very close and the G hands down is closer then what Kievet
    offers. I do think that the Gensler logo is a bit more condensed then if rendered
    by Slate. Kievit in that regards is closer.\r\n"

    as the G source]] and Kievit for the rest. The closure on the Kievit G doesn't
    even make it a candidate with an added 'beard', so I think Lex's suggestion wins
    my vote.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
