  please drop an email to\r\n\r\nrat_baggy [-at-] hotmail.com\r\n\r\nAll character
  art will exist, it seems that at this stage it will simply (or perhaps not) be a
  matter of placing the characters and producing the font file (cross platform etc)
  to international standards etc.\r\n\r\nPlease provide rough timeline, costing and
  or if you require additional information.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "Thanks to those who replied. Unfortunately it seems the client probably didn't
    realise the costs involved in a custom design & production of a font. I will keep
    your details on file should a similar project arise.\r\n\r\nFor others, feel free
    to drop me an email. I will keep them on file should the need arise again.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n<br
