body: "I am creating a grammar test online and I want to have the questions in .gif
  format and the answers in .gif format to help prevent copying (please don't focus
  on this. I am aware of the difficulties) I have a monitor with screen res. of 1920
  x 1080. I selected Arial Black, 16 pt as the text to use because it is clean, clear
  and bold. I use Fireworks and create a 700px x 72px, 300 DPI canvas and placed the
  text on this canvas and saved it as a .gif image. I have to create close to 4,000
  of these images. All are the exact same dimensions and the same format etc. I have
  two questions:\r\n1) Can this be automated somehow?\r\n2) How do I manage to make
  the images readable on all monitors? One of the people I contacted about creating
  these for me said the font size I chose (Arial Black 16) would not allow even one
  line of text on a 72px high canvas . So, what looks good on my screen looks bad
  on his. (I think this only applies to the text and that once the image is created,
  that issue will not pop up because the image and text will resize proportionately.
  What is the best way to go about finding out the optimal font size and image size
  to use for display across varying resolutions. (The images need to all be the same
  size and the text all needs to be the same size, type etc.)"

  body: "One of the inherent problems with designing for computers is that monitors
    vary in size. A Google search will find statistics on the most common sizes. You'd
    want to make it readable on the smallest common size monitor.\r\n\r\nWhen you
    say \"image\", is it text on a solid color background, or is there an actual image
    behind the text? GIF is bad format for photos and some other types of images."

  body: "If this is browser-based, as it sounds, drawing the text onto a canvas with
    Javascript might work, too; something like Typeface.js or Cuf\xF3n. After all,
    who is saying your would-be thieves wouldn\u2019t just OCR any images?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    scrambling the Typeface/Cuf\xF3n font (like putting the 'A' glyph into the '2'
    position and the 'a' glyph into the 'j' position) turns it into a substitution
    cipher, and typing up the text is much quicker than solving that."

  body: "Will this be web-based?\r\n\r\nYou know, there are easy ways using Javascript
    to disable text copying for individual web pages. People could still open the
    source code and copy the text (along with a bunch of coding), but really, most
    people wouldn't know how and, anyway, it would likely be more difficult than simply
    retyping the text from your images.\r\n\r\nIf you're sure that you want to go
    the 4,000 images route, I'd do as Joshua Langman suggested and build it all in
    InDesign using master pages, then export each page as an optimized PNG (I'd use
    PNGs, not GIFs). SVGs could work too, but my version of InDesign (CS 6) won't
    export to SVG (not sure about the CC version).\r\n\r\nUsing the right HTML/CSS
    coding, the images will get smaller as the display window decreases in size. You
    can also set up media queries in HTML that will custom format what a user sees
    based upon the resolution of his or her display.\r\n\r\nOf course you need to
    know how to do all this, but it's doable. The hard part would be the tedious task
    of preparing 4,000 pages."

  body: "Speaking of Javascript again, I mentioned previously that it can be used
    to prevent copying text directly from the browser window. It can also be used
    to obfuscate the text in the underlying source code, just in case someone thought
    they'd copy it from there.\r\n\r\nFor that matter it would be possible to obfuscate
    the text on the fly using a server-side language, like PHP. Plain text would be
    entered into the database through whatever CMS was being used, dynamically obfuscated
    as the data was queried, served, then deobfuscated  using Javascript on the client
    machine. Of course, it wouldn't be 100% secure, but it would be just as difficult
    and inconvenient to circumvent as grabbing text from a from a bunch of images.
    I'd also take measures to hide the test itself from being crawled by search engine
    bots.\r\n\r\nIt would take a bit of scripting, but it would be easier and a whole
    lot more flexible than creating 4,000 static images.\r\n\r\nHave you considered
    hiring this out to a developer or UX designer? I'm concerned that you're doing
    things the hard way and heading in a direction that will produced a cumbersome
    and less-than-ideal solution to your problem.\r\n\r\nOf course this is a typography
    forum, so back to that... You mentioned Arial Black as your typeface choice. I'd
    need to see the context in which you're using it, but it likely wouldn't be my
    first choice. I mean, it's sort of on the thick and bulky side of things."
