body: "Hi. I'm new here, and working on a music festival poster. Really need to find
  the font named \"SuperCooper\" from the 1960's/1970's. It's a bottom-weighted, heavy
  version of Cooper Black in the classic early Seventies ITC/U&lc style. May also
  be known as Super Cooper, SooperCooper, Sooper Cooper, etc. My old typographer had
  it in their Linotype catalog, but they're long gone.\r\nWould love to know if there's
  an online source for downloading SuperCooper this week; I've a deadline approaching.
  Cheap, shareware or freeware would be cool. Thanks for helping out, if you can.\r\nRandy\r\n\r\n"

    know, it has never been digitized...\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to learn that I'm wrong.\r\n\r\ndr"

    I could be wrong. But according to <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20041206183519/www.mm2000s.net/PhilsFonts.shtml\">this
    archive of his old website</a>, his distributors (MyFonts, Rooster Types, URW++)
    are not selling Supercooper."

    He worked with Phil Martin on digitizing some of Martin's designs. I don't know
    if they discussed this one at all.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    where I can at least view the entire SuperCooper font? I tossed out my type books
    years ago. SuperCooper looks like this...\r\nRandy\r\n\r\nJACKDAWS LOVE MY BIG
