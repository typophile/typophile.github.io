  body: What else might it look like?   This is an older french movie... My guess
    would be that they where both made in the 50's.

  body: "Nine volt is lovely... and fairly similar.\r\n\r\n\"Behin\" here does remind
    me of \"Plastac\" from the \"Mon Uncle\" film.... thats why I thought that that
    one was a font...\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/313555342/]]\r\nNow
    that I look at that one.. they are very dissimilar.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is possible
    that both are actually custom logos.\r\n\r\nDo you think that it might be worth
    my time to look in really old type specimen books for these? Instead of online?
    It would help too if bureau's cataloged by date of release... Does anyone do this?"

  body: I don't think it would be worth your time. Logos are often custom designed
    so they will be unique. This was even more common before digital type when it
    was much simpler to hand draw a logo than use metal or photo type. I am quite
    confident that these are not typefaces (digital or analog).

    Coles. Much obliged.\r\n\r\nThanks too for the serpintine guess bowfinpw. Don't
    take it personally, I just can't have garbage truck font associating with Tati
    in my mind :)"
