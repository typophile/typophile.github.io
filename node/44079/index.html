No! As an American, and as a human being, I have a right to express my disgust at the Chinese government's rejection of peaceful protest as a lawful activity. In this regard, it does not matter what ills my country has done—I still have the right to express my opinion.

My personal opinion, by the way, is not that there should be an official "boycott." I think that the games should go forward. We should just not care about them. Imagine if no world leaders would attend at all, and no one in the west would watch the programs on TV. That would be the best thing, I think. Then the Chinese people and athletes from around the word could still have their big Olympic party, but the Chinese government officials would know that they had lost, and that no one outside their country believes in them or supports them anymore.

Like James, I normally only watch a few Olympic events casually on TV. But this year, I will not be tuning in at all.</div>

Sure. I'm saying 'America' as a collective entity.

We a) are occupying a foreign country ourselves and b) china owns our ass. ;o)

That doesn't stop us as individuals from speaking up. But does make for tricky official foreign relations. 

I'm indifferent. Summer olympics are lame. It's all about the winter ones. ;0)</div>

That is exactly how it goes. I wonder if the PLAN included the selling or bail out of whatever assets possible. 'Some' stocks rampaged up 5X times... or more since the beginning of the PLAN.

I guess a boycott on .99 cents stuff is a start:  ¡ DO NOT BUY !

As for the games, well, I hope China don't win the gold on Soccer (Foot-ball).

"I don’t think there is even any serious discussion of ’America’ as a collective entity making any sort of response. Or have I been out of the country for too long?"

Exactly what happened when the 'escalation' was taking place: IT IS SAD...

		<div class="commentbody">Remember when they were wondering whether the Olympic Games being awarded to China would turn out like the 1936 Berlin Games or the 1988 Seoul Games--a celebration of a dictatorship or a push toward democracy?

Why I was somewhat insulted by this comparison as a South Korean: China may not be Nazi Germany, but considering it on the same level with South Korea under the military strongmen of the 1980s is simply wilful ignorance of nuances. South Koreans already had decades of experience in democratic elections and sporadic periods of genuine multi-party democracy (though eclipsed by longer periods of military authoritarian regimes) by the time the IOC awarded the 1988 games to Seoul.

There is also the difference in clout. South Koreans never have suffered from the illusion that they were a Great Power, immune to international pressure.

I do worry that the current situation is only going to fan an us-vs-the-world sentiment in the Chinese population. Innocent athletes and visitors from other countries may well suffer, as the terrified Japanese fans during the 2004 Asian Cup football tournament found out after Japan beat China in the final in Beijing and the home fans rioted.

<cite>As for the games, well, I hope China don’t win the gold on Soccer (Foot-ball).</cite>

I assure you, you can breathe easy on that one. ;-) Even the most resourceful dictatorships find it difficult to buy Football golds, unless you have world-class teams to start with (Italy 1934, Argentina 1978).</div>
