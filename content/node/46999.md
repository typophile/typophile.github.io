    to that before...I try and come up with it"

    appears to be very very close based on the image I provided.  However when I compare
    the [[http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/content/1/c6/03/13/21/Letter_layout.pdf|Sheffield
    letter layout pdf]] to Maple it appears to be very similar to that unless I am
    mistaken, but the Sheffield letter layout indicates that the font is called Blake,
    but does not seem to resemble any of the Stephenson Blake fonts that I have seen.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI
