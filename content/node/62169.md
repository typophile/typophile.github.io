  [[http://www.dafont.com/franklein.font|FranKlein]] free fonts, but am worried that
  it may be a rip of a commercial font. Does it ring a bell for any of you guys?\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: They aren't direct rips of anything. I see lots of flaws that would keep me
    from using them. But I'd guess you are in the clear.

  body: "Like Tiffany said, they aren't clearly direct rip-offs of anything, but they
    are clearly second- or third-rate junk. Spacing sucks on both. New Cicle also
    has some pretty obvious outline problems... this just from looking at the brief
    samples on screen.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Thanks. For a free font, I very much like the look of these. Do you have any
    particular favorites in terms of free fonts?

    it's obvious, but since I was momentarily confused, I'll mention that when Vitaly
    Friedman mentions \"license-free\" fonts, he is referring to fonts whose license
    allows their use free of charge."
