		<div class="commentbody">Exactly. What strikes me is that the prices of typefaces have  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->steadily decreased over the years (I used to be one third of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FontShop Belgium-Netherlands-Luxemburg, so I should  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->know) and people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->still moan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about what I perceive to be  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reasonable to frankly cheap prices.

		<div class="commentbody">Mea culpa! I didn't mean to start a firestorm here but I'm an independent designer who can't afford to drop upwards of $50 for just a single font. I like Emigre's price structure - generally $100 gets you about 4 styles (italic, alternate, sc, etc.) I used to work for a company that bought fonts as needed, and we built that into the job budget, but it's hard to get a client to pony up these days. It makes me less likely to experiment with the more outre fonts and more inclined to stick with the ones I already have (thousands), hence less exposure for you font designers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I love type and do very much appreciate all the creativity and hard work that goes into designing a font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To continue what Daniel said, if your client is a corporation or major publisher then a font is just a line item in the budget. If your client is an independent filmmaker or small restauranteur, they're not going to be so eager to purchase a new font. And those smaller jobs are often the ones that call for more interesting type treatments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The way I look at it, current font prices, which hover around $30 per font, are a good value. I base this on the price of a sheet of Letraset in 1980 which was about $10. If you take into account inflation, this would be about $25 in 2004 dollars. Modern fonts are a much better value than a sheet of Letraset (unlimited characters and sizes, the characters are never crooked, never crack, space themselves automatically, huge selection, etc.) and yet they cost only a little more. Consider also that a fonts for typesetting machines back then cost hundreds of dollars. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that the perception that some have about font prices comes from the fact that you get them for free or almost free with operating systems, software bundles, etc. combined with all the free fonts given away by hobbyist font designers. Both of these cases are unfair comparisons to retail fonts. In the first case, this is like saying toasters should be cheaper because your bank gives them away when you open a new account. In the second case, hobbyist fonts are not usually very well made or complete. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ultimately, the price has to be low enough that customers will pay it and high enough that font developers can make enough to make the effort worthwhile. It seems like it's there now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question I have is: If font prices were substantially lower, would substantially more people buy them? In other words, could font developers make more money if prices were lower? For instance, if a font is sold at half price, I'd have to have more than twice as many orders because my operational overhead would go up (more transaction costs, more potential support costs, etc.).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Patricia but I guess it all really comes to the thing that I say to my clients&hellip; &quot;Good, fast, cheap - choose any two&quot;. That's the reality of most production&hellip; sadly, my clients tend to choose &quot;cheap and fast&quot;. Oh well, such is life. The thing that I find difficult to incorporate into my billing structure is the amount of time I spend font-matching and then hunting down some obscure variation of a typeface only to find out that the client really has no visual literacy whatsoever. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recently, I went through all the hassle of doing a (IMHO) spiffy layout with a coehesive and lucid use of faces - client comes back with content change - I advise that now it physically will not fit on the page - they say&hellip; &quot;that's ok why don't you just squish it all to fit&hellip;&quot; Sheesh!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reality of being a designer is that you're not only in competition with other designers, but nowadays you're in competition with the quick-copy down the road, the client's kid who is &quot;really good with computers&quot;, the client's PA or accounts clerk, their partner who did their party invites and everybody said they were really great, et al. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The cost of fonts is reasonable I think - don't get me wrong - but when the difference between getting a job or not comes down to a very tight margin, and the fact that most clients are visually illiterate from my experience, then I find myself going for the freebies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->End result? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Font designers get paid a pittance and more visual pollution gets released in to the marketplace which then sets a benchmark that is emulated by the copycats&hellip; gets rather depressing actually. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry for bringing you down&hellip; man. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now it's my turn. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me a cowboy, me a cowboy, me a mexican cowboy!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;Fast, cheap, good - pick any two&quot; is one of my favorites too. Since fast and good are a given, I really resent the nickel and diming. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree that $30 is more than reasonable for a single font, and around $100 for a small package with a few weights or an italic and an alternate. But some of the more boutique foundries charge up to twice that, which usually puts the fonts out of my price range. And since I do already have so many fonts, I can nearly always find something great in my library. It's a pity, though, since if they were cheaper I'd be more likely to purchase them just because I like them, and then try to find a use.</div>

I use to work at an ad agency and one of the art directors wanted to use a font but the license would cost $300. The account rep went nuts, saying they couldn't afford it, that was until someone mentioned that the media for the ad alone was $30,000 and the retouching for the ad was almost $10,000.

		<div class="commentbody">I have no time to rejoin the discussion yet but let's just say I'm  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the same page with Tiff and Magnus.

As it was an  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extensive family I declined and insisted on purchasing the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->license for a job, in order to support both a foundry I regard  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->highly and the type designer. The purchase ate away half  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my profit for this particular job, but as I consider this a general  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->investment I will be able to use it again and by doing so spread  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->out the cost over several jobs.

		<div class="commentbody">In my opinion, most of the time, type is reasonably priced, especially in light of how long good type takes to develop. But even as a lover of type sometimes type prices can be out of reach for a small studio. Beautiful type like DfType's Rialto costs 570 Euros (and involves a complex bank transfer), and Lineto fonts are like $150 per weight(!), if I'm reading those prices correctly.  These $100 and more a weight prices put these great fonts out of my reach. Perhaps magazines and larger studios can afford them. Shouldn't they be a teensy bit cheaper (they'd almost certainly sell more) or is exclusivity a factor here?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When a type designer designs a typeface or family for retail sale he/she doesn't know if it will sell or not. You just have to hope that the fonts will catch somebody's eye.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is a speculative and time-consuming enterprise with no guarantee of success. I spend months designing a font or family. One particular typeface in my collection (I'm not saying which one) has been on sale for a while and hasn't sold one copy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now if this was the first font I had designed for retail I would have been very discouraged by the lack of any renumeration and would have probably given it up as a waste of time and effort.
