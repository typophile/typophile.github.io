		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

		<div class="commentbody">These glyphs are very geometric which makes some very unstable and visually uneven. Take /s/ for instance which seems as if top half is bigger than the bottom half.

Glyphs also seem of having different weight. Look at word /often/ in the second line. /e/ seems much lighter compared to neighbouring /f/ and /t/.

You will have to change bowl of /a/ because it seems as if someone is pushing it up on the left.

But otherwise... With some work this monospaced font may be useful even though lately there's tendency for readable shaped monospaced fonts. Imagine developers reading and writing code all day long. It's easier to read all that code when font is much more legible. "Consolas" for instance (which is a modern monospaced font) is a very good example of such font. Non-legible monospaced fonts are otherwise too much strain and tend to make people tired after using them for hours.</div>

Since I assume your primary goal in writing such books is to convey the <em>content</em> to readers (as opposed to express your desire to design fonts) what I would ask first is: what do you find lacking in existing monospace fonts you could use?

BTW, if you like Consolas, also try Inconsolata.  :-)

Then why did I designed it? 

Monospaced typefaces have a certain charm, that makes them appropriate for a number of occasions, such as for headings in any computer and technology-related book or magazine(or user documentation) and also in comment forms such as the one  that I am using right now).

		<div class="commentbody">> Monospaced typefaces have a certain charm

Indeed!

What I might suggest in this case is a reliance on fewer "modules" to make up the letters. To me there's too much variance and unevenness, making the result more "messy" than "fun".

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not convinced you must reduce yourself to only one "trick," but I do agree with Hrant that there is... well I'd say "too much going on."

Also, the bold really needs some different treatment of how curves join straight stems, because they look pretty clotted. Any one or more of these options might help:
- optical compensation (thinning the curved strokes a bit before they join)
- changing the letterforms so they don't usually extend past the join (like at the bottom of a "b" for instance)
- increasing the angle of the joins
- reducing the weight of the bold

Can you name some specific characters, that look messy, or/and don't fit in? I attached the character set of my typeface (look at the top of the page.)</div>
