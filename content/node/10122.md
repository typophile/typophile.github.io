body: This is my first typography project in my graduated course. I used my handwriting
  and brushes of Chinese calligraphy to create my own typeface. My medium is Illustrator.
  Please give me any opinion, I want to make them more specific and creative. <BR>

  body: 'I think these first characters look nice, but it may be hard to give any
    decent opinion, or helpful feedback, after having seen just those two or three
    characters.. &#40; Do you have any more samples to show.? Any other characters.?
    Any scribbles, sketches.? &#41; <BR> <BR><i>&#40; Oh, And a mod note.: Maybe this
    thread should rather be in the &#39;Script / Handwriting&#39; part of the &#39;Critique&#39;
    forum, at Typophile.? &#41;</i>'
