  of Times and Arial, only to have your senses assaulted by a kaleidoscope of ghastly
  garishness?\r\n\r\nChecking a list of references in an article about greenhouse
  gas emissions, I found myself confronted with this from those crazy cats at the
  International Energy Agency: \r\nhttp://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2008/key_stats_2008.pdf\r\n\r\nMy

    colourful, not dull\".\r\n\r\nSimply stunning. I need something basic in b/w to
    get my eyes back in balance."

  body: "something I've only just spotted: the page numbers are all on the left, but
    the even numbers are higher up the page than the odds so that they bounce up and
    down as you go from page to page (plus that circle running off to the side margin
    for the evens and the bottom margin for the odds is OTT). Did someone put this
    together thinking \"waaay cool...\"?\r\n\r\nThe \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" cover page
    is a laugh. So much for chic French design. Hee hee...\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
    since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working."

    in question has been moved (or removed) from that location. Of course, there are
    newer versions available now. They must have modernized the template in the intervening
