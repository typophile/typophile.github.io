  the Typophile volunteers. It occurred to me that there could be additional ways
  of generating contributions for the upkeep of the site. \r\n\r\nOne idea that just
  jumped unbidden into my mind was that we could make a CD or download-pack showcasing
  some of the talent we have here and bringing together the best resources. A compilation
  of type specimens, fonts (beta versions or otherwise not commercially ready) and
  the public domain articles/resources most useful for people in this community. There
  are probably lots of other things that could be included, but I'm at work and unable
  to spend time thinking about it for the moment. There could even be opportunities
  for advertising, why not. Events calendar?\r\n\r\nThe idea would be for members
  to submit their ideas, then there would be some selection process and then the resulting
  pack could be purchased online for download.\r\n\r\nThere are a few fonts I'm working
  on which will never get to the stage of commercial release but which I'd consider
  submitting when a bit more finished. Would anyone else consider submitting pre-release
  things like this? Could be good publicity. I'd also be able to dedicate time to
  a project like this if it went ahead.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's maybe a fun thing to do
  so I thought I'd see what everybody thinks. Sometimes ideas are not to be trusted
  though, so if this sounds rubbish please post your thoughts. \r\n\r\nBetter get
  back to creating training materials templates now..."

    it's entirely possible that I'm the only person who cares for the bathtubability

    just do it all online."

  body: ">bathtubability\r\n\r\nWhat a brilliant word! :D\r\n\r\n10 years! Great!
    It sounds like we've certainly got enough stuff here to draw on. I'll put on my
    thinking hat and develop the idea a little. Of course if anyone has any brainwaves,
    dump them here and we can review in a while. \r\n\r\nThe trouble with printing
    would be the expense I think. Online publishing would have much lower costs, but
    you're right there is something just better about physical objects. I love it
    when stuff I've designed comes in a delivery! Opening the boxes is always a daunting
    and exciting moment!"
