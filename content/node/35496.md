  the fonts in the samples attached, but with (almost) no success so far, thus I would
  greatly appreciate if you could please help?\r\n\r\nSample 1 (which is from 1986):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pop86_3499.JPG]\r\n\r\n\r\nClosest
  match I got so far was <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/berling/>Berling</a>...
  (I'm only somewhat in doubt cos of the italic \"f\"?... It could also be that it
  may possibly have gotten misprinted, though, don't know?...  Since it's printed
  in plastic...)\r\n\r\nSample 2 (which is from 1997):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pop97_4368.JPG]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo
  idea of this other one. Also no idea whether the obliqued letters are the actual
  italic version of the font, or then just custom slanted?... (Possibly the later?...)\r\n\r\nI'm
  also adding all other characters I have from the sample I have from this font, if
  useful:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pop97all_4965.JPG]\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce
  more, thank you greatly, for all further help, identifying these fonts. :-)\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for the confirmation about Berling. :-)\r\n\r\nWith regards to
    the font used in the second sample, hmm, I see... (You mean something as what's
    referred for example <a href=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Acrobat/8.0/Standard/help.html?content=WS566B3A80-3839-4e12-B776-FCFBF60D09EA.html>in
    this article</a>, correct?)\r\n\r\nCuriously, though, the printed source of this
    sample does include also other fonts, and these other fonts do all appear correctly...
    I wonder, would this be \"weird\" at all, or?... I.e. I mean, it is possible that,
    in case a file has more than one font, some may have been embeded properly, and
    only one or another not, right? (Which would be the case here, then, I guess.)
    Or? Hmm...\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, hmm, would it by chance be possible that
    the Adobe Serif Substitution Font as you mention, would have been chosen \"deliberately\"?
    Or not at all? In other words, are these Adobe Master Susbstitution Fonts exclusively
    for being \"called up\" when the original font in a document is missing, or can
    themselves as well be chosen to be the original font from the start, just like
    any other font, or?... (I hope you understand my doubt?... And please do pardon
    my ignorance... :-P)\r\n\r\nAlso, would there be any website you could please
    refer me to, where I could view the charmap of the Adobe Serif Substitution Font,
    and as well the italic version of it? Much appreciated. (Been looking, but can't
    seem to find that anywhere...)"

    possible because it won't show up in any font selection menu. It virtually is
    a 'ghost font'.\r\n\r\n\r\n> <em>Or not at all? In other words, are these Adobe
    Master Susbstitution Fonts exclusively for being \u201Ccalled up\u201D when the

    <em>or can themselves as well be chosen to be the original font from the start,
    just like any other font, or?...</em>\r\n\r\nNo, because this is not 'any other
    font' -- it's an automatic substitution font whose characters and letter widths
    are squooshed and stretched to perfectly fit another font's widths.\r\n\r\n> <em>Also,
    would there be any website you could please refer me to, where I could view the

    never intended to be used on purpose."
