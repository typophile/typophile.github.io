  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">No type in this one, but it is a design question. I just picked up an Epson R1800 printer to use for comping things that I can’t do on laser printers. Because nothing I do on this printer needs to last long I am thinking about using third-party inks to save money, but I don’t want to buy the wrong ones and trash a $500 printer. Has anyone found a good ink brand for Epson printers that doesn’t have to be purchased as a continuous inking system?</div>

<p>i never tried generic inks, but i&rsquo;ve had nothing but disappointment with epson printers and am currently LOVING my canon i9900. it uses 8 colors, the ink cartriges are much cheaper than other brands, and it&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>unfortunately, the newer model (canon pro9000), which i use at an outside office, is less desirable. in our rabid rush toward making every last machine seem &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, they&rsquo;ve added microchips to the ink cartridges in the pro9000. these chips aren&rsquo;t smart, they&rsquo;re stupid. they prevent one from using the printer when any of its diagnostic functions are alerted, and i&rsquo;ve had false alerts that are impossible to override.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sticking with dumber (but strictly canon) cartridges.</p>

If I wanted to proof type I would rather use a 1200dpi laser printer, which could be had pretty cheaply. At least the cartridges are separate now, I remember when they had 2 - black and CMY.</p>
<p>You could save some money by turning the Gloss Optimizer off, although it really helps when printing photos.</p>

<p>The 1800 takes rolls, and I think the 1900 does. Rolls can be a great money-saver because one doesn’t end up wasting chunks of large sheets.</p>
<p>We have a few 4800s and a 7600 at school. The 4800s are fabulous, but the 7600 churns out some really awful colors on Epson paper. $5 per giant roll crap paper from the local art shop works great tho. Regardless of model, big Epson printers are horrible for sheet-fed printing. My last office had three 24&quot; Epson printers; two were purchased because another one had stopped accepting sheets of paper at very inopportune moments.</p>

<p>My problem with Epsons is that if you don&rsquo;t use them regularly the heads are a mess and you have to replace the inks no matter how much is left in the cartridge. I don&rsquo;t use my machine on a daily or even weekly basis but when I do need to use it I want it to work without my having to overhaul it every time. I don&rsquo;t want to have to squander expensive toner and paper just to keep the thing &ldquo;lubricated&rdquo; every day.</p>
<p>I had bought Power RIP software for the first Epson - total waste of money, the color was hideous. I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s improved now. Don&rsquo;t have a RIP on the newer machine, but if I make everything CMYK the color is pretty good. I print straight from Quark, not from PDF. I&rsquo;m not using it for proofing, just for comps tho.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have this problem with my lovely laser printer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You can run into postcript problems if you, for example, combined an Illustrator logo, a photo and some type in Indesign and tried to print it. At least that&rsquo;s what used to happen to me. If you print from PS or Illy it will rip it for you. The problem is there is not a postcript interpreter in the inkjet so if you send it a job that requires it, you will get an error.
I haven&rsquo;t tried this for quite a while, but I remember Quark jobs blowing up on me with an early Epson.
Acrobat may well rip the file for you as well, that&rsquo;s just not something I have tried.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I can print using the non-postscript Epson rasterizer and it looks like ass, in a really bad way. No sharp edges on anything and the color is way off. The RIP just gets the postscript function to work, and usually allows for custom profiling associated with different resolutions and paper. I can&rsquo;t get the 1440 res on mine without it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Did you read that link I posted? That addresses how to get to the printer settings. Also how to use any profiles you may have. Epson makes really good profiles for most of their papers, the only one that hasn&rsquo;t worked well for me so far is Velvet Fine Art paper, I just downloaded a new one and have yet to try it. The Premium Lustre also needed a little tweaking but once you get it the results are outstanding.
So are you saying you can print from a layout program (Quark or InDesign) and it looks bad? Or are you printing from Acrobat?
The basic thing that is recommended is that you turn off color management in the printer and let the Adobe programs manage the color. I have had really good results using that.
It also solved a problem of mine at work where InDesign would change the black plate behind .psd transparencies. I turned off color management in the printer and it looks great now. There was absolutely no problem in the files. Basically things were being double color managed (since everything you send from an Adobe program is color managed no matter how hard you try and turn it off) and that led to problems.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Color management in general is a nightmare. Part of what I do is very old-fashioned. Being in print I have a very good idea of what different percentages of ink will accomplish. All the folks that are touting RGB workflows are counting on CM. I think that&rsquo;s a dangerous attitude unless you have good relationships with everyone who is outputting your files. I don&rsquo;t have that luxury, I don&rsquo;t even know who is outputting most of my stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I have used a Epson 10600 at work. It worked three years with no problems. Then we had to change the head.
As is already noted, only use their brand ink. I am thinking of getting a R1800 one for me to print on canvas. Question is: Do I need a RIP software? Yes&hellip; I have a BestColor RIP 4.6 or what but this stuff is too old already and don&rsquo;t support newer printers&hellip;</div>
