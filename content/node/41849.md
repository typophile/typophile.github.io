  time.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between condensed and compressed? Are there
  rules to when and where to use these versions of a font? I don't believe I've ever
  had the inclination to use these versions, but when I see my friend's work I know
  it's out of place. I can't really make a good argument for or against his use of
  these styles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone enlighten me? "

  body: Every face is different, but I've used helve condensed for setting warnings
    and other dense info on the back of packages. In this case condensed is still
    legible. Compressed usually means you've got some extra weight as well and probably
    need to use this for display work. So maybe you could generalize that condensed
    should be legible at smaller sizes, but not compressed.

  body: "So, Condensed fonts are primarily used at smaller sizes and in utilitarian
    capacities? And Extended and Compressed fonts are capable of being used as display
    fonts at much larger sizes?\r\n\r\nWhat would make me want to choose an extended
    or compressed style over a standard one? Would it only be based on size limitations,
    like a newspaper column then? Is that why extended and compressed fonts were designed,
    for justified copy?"

    Apparently stars will have the typeface their names must appear on the credits
    and billing materials specified, but only for height. Result, letters 72 points
    high and 3 points wide (I exaggerate, but not much).

  body: No, he's just a regular freelance designer. He just seems to use extended
    and condensed fonts in all of this designs (from print to web). Helvetica Condensed
    to Trade Gothic Extended... It's a little frustrating to see.

  body: I don't think you can make grand generalizations, but condensed fonts almost
    all look like a compromise to me. There are times when they are handy though,
    like setting in a narrow column or on the front of a can or other cylindrical
    object. I usually look for a face that is somewhat narrow to start with, rather
    than using a condensed version. Compressed versions will often close up at smaller
    sizes. But then I'm just a regular freelance designer as well.

    That's a generalization. ;^) Unless I misunderstood what you meant.\r\n\r\nDavid
    Berlow. To name one grand master of designing compressed and condensed fonts.
    Christian Schwartz, Jonathan Hoefler, Tobias Frere-Jones, and Cyrus Highsmith.
    Just a short list of people who have designed companion widths for their fonts.\r\n\r\nGood
    point about compressed being good for display. I've used compressed in display
    and then condensed for smaller text before and I find that to work well if I want
    to maintain some sort of continuity of style."

  body: "is it fair to say that a glyphs in a condenced font are condenced differencially
    - giving up proportionally more width for some letters and less for others to
    preserve the character of the typeface and a compressed font is a bit more \"ruthless\"
    in that all letters are narrowed more or less uniformly?\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "I find that the relative character proportions of the normal need to be modified
    for the other scalings. So characters that are relatively narrow in the normal
    need to be widened, relatively, in the extended, because one doesn't want narrow-looking
    characters in an extended style. And vice versa for the condensed.\r\n\r\nYou
    can see this principal in Futura:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CE_6697.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    in general, condensed and extended styles have a greater homogeneity of glyph
    width than the normal proportion of type.\r\n\r\nWith the popularity of semi-condensed
    sans faces, we're seeing more typography with even-width letterforms."

    do with it, and the constraints of copyfitting in a specific layout. The classic
    example is the headline that was being left open for a one-column story in a newspaper,
    on the result of a motor race. The winner was \"Rickenbacker in a Duesenburg\"
    (or something like like that), hence the need for ultra-squished fonts."

    They save space and can be really eyecatching, especially those quirky old condensed
    gothic and grotesque designs. Condensed type can also be a lifeline when designing
    for writers who simply do not understand concepts like brevity or understatement.
    For example, Today I used Pill Gothic 300mg to deal with a postcard and a half-page
    magazine ad that could not contain the text in the 600mg width."
