body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nYears ago I installed Fontographer for windows xp. Since rebuilding
  my system I have started over from scratch. I keep getting the out of memory message
  when i start fontographer. I remember editing some numbers, not the virtual memory.
  Does anyone know how to fix this?\r\n\r\nThanks and much appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Chuck

    fan noise as needed. :-/  Are you using Fog 4.1 or something earlier?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
