body: This is a scan of the title page of the book. I couldn't get a good match using
  whatthefont or identifont. Identifont suggests Aldus, but that doesn't look correct
  to me. But I figure it's an easy one for the trained eyes of this forum? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/radical-chic-typeface-sample_5514.jpg]

  body: Yes, Palatino Bold is a good suggestion. But the uppercase F doesn't look
    like the Palatino Bold I'm looking at (Adobe). [img:sites/default/files/old-images/radical-chic-typeface-sample-w-Palatino_4142.jpg]

    name of \u2018Marathon Serial\u2019, by SoftMaker. I don\u2019t know about the
    legitimacy of that release, though."
