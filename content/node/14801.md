  to turn?\r\n\r\nI am looking for some suggestions for a Client Extranet Software.
  This would need to be PHP based with MySQL database conncetions. Run on Apache.\r\n\r\nIt's
  purpose would be for client proofing/approval/communication.\r\n\r\nI am trying
  to find some suggestions, as we re-structure our online proofing.\r\n\r\n"

    application. Which would be run on a Apache Server, utilizing PHP, and a MySQL
    database.\r\n\r\nThis would be a web-based client extranet."

  body: It seems to be much more project management, than a client extranet. All we
    really need is a extranet proofing application.. preferably one we can tweak code
    on. Suggestions?

    listed heaps of open source content management systems and let you preview them
