  body: Whenever I encounter a recalcitrantly corrupt file, I usually generate a Postscript
    Type 1 version, then open that in FontLab and work from there. It's a lot faster
    that copy glyphs individually into a new file and, so far, this method has effectively
    remove whatever voodoo resides in FL's OpenType apparatus...

  body: "Thanks to you both for your suggestions. Luckilly, I won't have to try them
    on this file (so far anyway). \r\n\r\nThe MAN, THE MASTER, Karsten Luecke, has
    shined a big light on my problem. He told me that glyph names containing a hyphen
    make FontLab very unhappy! After I corrected that, my font compiled quite happily.
    It seems the cryptic 'Syntax error at \"-63\"' referred to the hyphen which was
    followed by a 63 in the glyph name. Not that this was apparent to me before--I
    had been looking through my code pasted in Excel so that the lines would be numbered
    and I could find \"Line 63\"--wrong line of thinking on my part. I sure wish FontLab
    would write error messages that don't require so much detective work to figure
    out. It would be niceer to be prompted while typing the glyph name with a hyphen
    to get an alert sound and a message saying \"hyphens are not proper syntax for
    glyph names\".\r\n\r\nAt any rate, THANK YOU KARSTEN!!!\r\n\r\nChrisL"
