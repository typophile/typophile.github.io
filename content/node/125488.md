body: "The attached FontLab script is intended to copy composites from specific, already
  existing glyphs in the PUA range, into new code points. \r\nThis is for a specific
  application which uses differently encoded fonts on Mac and Windows. Therefore,
  to make the font platform independent, the script has to make two copies of each
  PUA glyph, and paste them to different codepoints.\r\n\r\nThe script works fine
  as long as it doesn't have to go through the glyph creation process twice in succession.
  However, when I try to create glyphs for both platforms in one go, the script crashes.\r\n\r\nI'm
  fairly new to scripting in fontLab and to Python in general, so I'm hoping someone
  here will spot the error pretty fast.\r\nAny further constructive criticism on the
  code would also be most welcome."
