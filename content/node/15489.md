    about licensing options?\r\n\r\nLinotype's got a Thorowgood digitization: http://www.linotype.com/90318/thorowgood-family.html\r\n\r\nDon't
    know about Figgin's\u2026"

  body: Matthew Carter did a couple of Figgins fonts in 1992 for a Microsoft Font
    Pack. They're shown in his section of the first Indie Fonts book. I wonder what
    became of them?

  body: "I've been researching similar material - and if you want reproductions of
    the original printed examples rather than existing fonts, I can wholly recommend
    'An Atlas of Typeforms' by James Sutton & Alan Bartram, published 1967 by Lund
    Humphries (I think). Although it's old and very large format, this should be available
    by library interloan, and I believe it carries examples of all three you're looking
    for.\r\nAdditionally, sample settings of the Caslon and the Figgins are both shown
    on p.20,21 of the old Baseline 'sans serif' issue from 1991. The uppercase of
    the Caslon can be found on p.31 of Justin Howes 'Johnston's Underground Type'
    2000 by Capital Transport."
