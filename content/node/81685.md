body: "Hi Im student and recently working on my project proposal. \r\nI am strongly
  interested in typography, there are endless limits to what you can do. My chosen
  filed of study will mainly focus on  Experimental/Expressive Typography and I would
  like to explore this topic more further. The purpose of this project is to investigate
  the idea of legibility, readability, style, movement and how type can be taken beyond
  its basic and what Experimental Typography really means. The word \"experiment\"
  oxford dictionary define as a scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery,
  demonstrate a known fact or a course of action tentatively adopted without being
  sure of the outcome. In this context, an experiment is a test of idea; set of actions
  to prove or disprove an idea. In a graphic design and typography, experiment as
  a noun has been used to signify anything new, unconventional, defying easy categorization,
  or confounding expectations.  This is something what I wish to explore within this
  project.\r\nCould you give me some advice or how I could possible narrow this down??\r\nTHANX\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"

    clearly define what \u201Cexperiment\u201D means in either context and show how
    the same word means two different things?\r\n\r\nb) find examples of scientific
    experimental typography (eg Tinker) and unconventional typography (eg Carson)?\r\n\r\nc)
    combine the 2 and create your own design and or experiment?\r\n\r\nd) all of the
    above\r\n\r\ne) none of the above\r\n\r\nFor what school, program and level of
    study is this for and who is your teacher/supervisor?"

  body: "I study at Central St. Martins university in London BA Graphic Design and
    Interaction and this is my major project proposal. This project is eight months
    long  and I would like to keep my proposal open for further research and discoveries.
    Mostly I would like to \r\ninvestigate the idea of legibility, readability, style,
    movement and how type can be taken beyond its basic and what Experimental Typography
    really means. Im a bit lost and running out of time...\r\nthanks Christopher \r\n"

    vague for a major project.\r\nFocus on something you like (to do), that will be
    more productive. And then experiment."

  body: "After more research I have decided focus on typography in era of modernism
    and postmodernism. This will allow me to examine and compare two different typographic
    styles which came one after the other. I want to question the ideologies of a
    Swiss modernist consisting that of a formalist, rationalist nature to that of
    a Postmodernist more expressive, subjective and experimental nature through a
    series of methods but also question how they could work in today\u2019s extremely
    multicultural society.\_Questioning graphic design of certain times and trying
    to get a better understanding of the ideologies and what affected them. I planned
    to do this in a number of ways to gain a more intense knowledge of design history.
    So I can come to acknowledge the deeper messages of their work rather than just
    visual inspiration. So I really feel the need to study their reasoning in much
    more detail.\r\n\r\nthanks for all your comments "

  body: "TINKA, this is still a massive proposal. It's tempting for your final project
    to try and tackle too broad a spectrum of ideas but it might be useful to keep
    refining your area of interest - a portion of the allotted 8 months might be given
    to this process.\r\n\r\nOf all the philosophies and movements you have described
    above, what is your core interest?"
