  body: "Just a note to let you all know that with only 2 weeks to go half the tickets
    for SweetTalkNYC have now sold out. We can't wait to meet whoever can make it
    for Paddy's Day in The Big Apple, it promises to be an amazing event with live
    interviews with Dalek & Glen E. Friedman alongside presentations by the others.
    Included in the unbelievably cheap door tax of $20 is a giftbag for the first
    150 people through the doors... This will include presents from Veer, Kidrobot,
    Royal Magazine and more... Fun times ahead...\r\n\r\nKeep well. Thanks. Richard.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.candyculture.net"
