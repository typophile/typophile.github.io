body: i need some help and some answers. is it best to make the letters of a connecting
  script just touch, or should there be some overlap? i've been working on a font
  and most of my connections seem smooth, but some of them are just funky. does anyone
  have any tips on how to get consistently smooth connectors? anything i haven't brought
  up that i need to keep in mind?

  body: "Paul,\r\nYou don't say what stype the script is. Is it handwriting, copperplate,
    calligraphic, wild or tame? Some styles offer more leeway; some, like copperplate
    styles, limit your options for a joining scheme. An informal design can have no
    instrokes, only outstrokes. Then your only issue is getting everything spaced
    so the outstrokes fall on the correct spot (or area). \r\n\r\nIf the joins have
    to be very delicate and precise, I think it is better to have overlap; If gaps
    appear in rasterization, it looks broken. \r\n\r\nI assume you're going to take
    advantage of OpenType to get all your joins just right?  "

    \r\n\r\nin practice rounded overlaps are better than squared off ones.\r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: thanks for the tips. to give more info, i'm playing with (i can't really say
    i'm working on them) several scripts of the copperplate-ish variety. all revivals,
    so the joining scheme is all worked out, but even in the metal some of the joins
    were wonky and of course the metal had no overlap... so that's why i asked these
    questions. thanks again for all your tips.
