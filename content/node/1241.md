  body: ' I&#39;m with Marc. I like the idea of the tail, but as it&#39;s drawn, it&#39;s
    not working. The outer curve of the tail should be less circular and more acute,
    thickening the stroke and emphasizing the angle of the bend a bit more. You still
    might ultimately decide against the tail, but you&#39;ll have a better tail to
    consider. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
    <BR> <BR>I also like bj&#39;s idea of an &#34;FI&#34; ligature. It&#39;s worth
    a try. <BR> <BR>David '

    not really like it. It seemed like it could look a bit like a stylized &#39;A&#34;

  body: Okay. BJ was thinking along the same lines, but not quite <BR>the same. So
    the top of these two images is what I meant,  <BR>but now I take it back cause
    there are too many tricks in  <BR>this bag. &para; So then I tried the bottom
    of the two. I  <BR>removed the cholla-ness of the letter &#40;although it would  <BR>be
    better to just draw your own shapes&#41; and added a little  <BR>uniqueness. Only
    for the sake of ideas. &para; As for tests and  <BR>finding a good fit when working
    on any identity &#40;logo,  <BR>whatever&#41; IMO if you plan on altering the
    type to make it  <BR>more &#34;ownable&#34; by the company, it is always easier
    &#40;and  <BR>best?&#41; to start from a simple &#40;yet strong&#41; foundation
    and  <BR>add. When using type that is too unique already &#40;too  <BR>tricky,
    trendy&#41; it is difficult IMO to avoid making things  <BR>even more tricky.

  body: ' I have been busy that past couple of weeks and did not notice all the re-workings/posts
    till&#39; tonight.  <BR>I guess the thing to mention is that the client is kind
    of a minimalist. I tried a few extra mods that did not exactly increase legibility
    and client wanted it as simple as possible considering the budget ran out and
    new mods would cost extra them extra. I think perhaps the fi ligature is a bit
    too close to resembling a cap &#39;A&#34; but it has gone to print and there is
    unfortunantly no more time for exploration. I appreciate the input. '
