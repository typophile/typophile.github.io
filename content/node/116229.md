  body: "Looks like a generic monoline serif, like the upper case from a typewriter
    font,  e.g. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/prestige-elite/ or a monoline serif
    like ITC Officina Serif http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/officina-serif/ or Brix
    Slab Condensed http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brix-slab-condensed/\r\nIf
    you want to use it on an embroidery machine there are companies that sell fonts
    for use on the machines, e.g. http://www.8clawsandapaw.com/typewriter-alphabet-embroidery-design.html
    or  http://www.8clawsandapaw.com/back-to-basics-embroidery-fonts.html\r\nDon\r\n"
