  HTF Gestalt as part of a short lecture about \u201Cminimal\u201D typefaces \u2013
  Pierre di Sciullo\u2019s Minimum, Herbert Bayer\u2019s Universalschrift, Wim Crouwel\u2019s
  New Alphabet and so on. I have some HTF specimen booklets as visual documentation,
  but I'd like to show the typeface in \u201Cregular\u201D use as well. Does someone
  over here know if HTF Gestalt has ever been used in some \u201Creal\u201D context
  \u2013 magazine layout, book cover, anything ?\r\nThank you very much.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gestalt_6584.png]"

    and they'll know better then anyone else. I visited them 2 years ago on a NYC
    trip and exchanged a few emails with JH, and he was nothing but helpful.\r\n"
