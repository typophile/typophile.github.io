  my first(ish) font in TypeTool. It's only a pixel font (yeah, yeah, I know, does
  the world need any more? but it's only for my own edification really), and I've
  got a bit carried away drawing small caps and ligatures and different types of numerals
  etc.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: short of upgrading to FontLab*,
  is there a cheap/simple way of adding OpenType layout tables to turn these characters
  into usable features?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've spent a while trying
  to read the VOLT pages on MS's website but it's left my head spinning as I'm no
  techie.\r\n\r\n\r\n*which I may end up doing at some future point <em>anyway</em>
  I suppose...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________\r\nEver

    \"VOLT and InDesign\" tutorial should be the best to start with.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"

  body: "Okay, that made things seem less intimidating, so I installed and had a go.
    My ligatures are now working a treat.\r\n\r\nBut: what determines the glyph IDs
    and therefore the order they appear in in the \u2018Glyph Editor' window? My lower-case
    Latin alphabet (and the Greek one, come to that) appear in a nice uninterrupted
    sequence when I work on the font in TypeTool, but they're quite jumbled up when
    I open it in VOLT. (For example, I get f-u in sequence, then w-z, and the other
    letters are scattered about the font later in the list.) This is obviously causing
    the substitution to go awry when I try to use glyph groups for the small caps
    feature.\r\n\r\n(As it happens, the numerals have stayed in a row so the group
    substituions for &lt;onum&gt; work fine)\r\n\r\nI know I could create the small
    caps substitutions one by one instead of using groups, but I want to understand
    what's wrong! \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "In glyph window, VOLT display glyphs ordered by glyph id. May be you display
    glyphs in FontLab ordered by Unicode? \r\n\r\nVOLT always order glyphs in group
    by glyph id, so if your glyphs are not ordered consistently you will get in trouble.
    For example, if you a has glyph id 3, b is 4, but a.sups is 11 and b.sups is 10,
    then <code>{a,b} -> {a.sups, b.sups}</code> will map <code>{3,4}</code> to <code>{10,11}</code>,
    so a will become b.sups, and b will become a.sups. Only way is to avoid this is
    to reorder glyphs or list them in lookup separately.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n"

    could copy glyphs in the order in which you wish them to appear?
