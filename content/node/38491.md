body: I'm looking for resources and hints about designing Katakana glyphs. Something
  like <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/">Briem</a> for Latin would be fine.

  body: "DTP World Font Style Book is a handy stylistic reference, just so you can
    see what's already been done but it doesn't show full katakana sets. A good exercise
    is to draw three styles of Katakana: a calligraphic style, a Times New Roman style
    and a Helvetica style. What I mean by Times New Roman style is katakana that harmonizes
    with a generic Roman. There are lots of them and hard (for me) to tell apart.
    Then there's the common sans serif style seen on every Japanese magazine, paired
    with a Helvetica alphabet. If you draw those three styles, you can get an idea
    of the conservative distortion that's allowed.\r\n\r\nOf course, you'll have to
    test your fonts with Japanese readers to find out where you went wrong."
