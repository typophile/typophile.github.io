    &#40;it&#39;s not Apex Sans&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m extremely busy for the moment,
    but I&#39;ll get back to you  <BR>as soon as I can. Unless someone else finds
    it before that. ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>About that subject line: are you making fun
    of us? Honestly? <BR>Because, if you do, I guarantee we&#39;ll make your gnome
    suffer. <BR>Big time. You&#39;ll wake up screaming for the rest of your life,  <BR>haunted
    by sickening sound of broken pottery and the horrible  <BR>death rattle of your
    shiny little friend. We take no $h!t from  <BR>gnome-lovers... <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: My thoughts exactly, Stewf. This is friggin&#39; frustratin&#39;. <BR> <BR>I
    believe we&#39;re looking for a rather industrial drawing- <BR>looking contemporary
    sans, rather rectangular, slightly  <BR>reminiscent of Isonorm, Faux-CRA, Foundry
    Monoline  <BR>and the likes. Stroke ends appear rounded, spurs on &#39;r&#39;  <BR>and
    &#39;m&#39; are quite pointy. <BR> <BR>Places to look might be <a href="http://www.lineto.com/index.html?dir_id=60&amp;cat=60"
