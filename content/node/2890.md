  body: ' Hello Ramiro and Gregory, normally I use the same file to creat a different
    enconding, I only change the file when I want to make a ISO latin 1 or other.
    I use the same file to mantain all information &#40; letters, space, kerning pairs
    ...&#41;, the only thing in fact that change is the enconding. If somebody have
    more experience in this case I would like to know with more details.  <BR> <BR>Regards
    for both / Ricardo '
