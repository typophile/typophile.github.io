body: Hi together, <BR> <BR>I have a problem. I build a typeface and generate it as
  Opentype &#40;Postscript&#41; on MacOSX with fontlab 4.6. <BR>the problem is, that
  the standard ligatures &#40;fi, fl&#41; doesnt apear in InDesignCS. I checked everything,
  export options, UNICODE, indesign, etc. i have no problem with other fonts generated
  with fontlab, they &#40;the standard ligatures&#41; all work. but not in that font.  <BR>the
  strange thing is, if i make a new font and copy all letters from the problem font
  to the new font and generate it again as opentype i got the same problem, that the
  fi and fl ligatures are not used by indesign &#40;or textedit&#41; under osx. so,
  my theory is that there is something in the font itself that surpress the use of
  ligatures in such programs. <BR> <BR>has anyone an idea where the problem could
  be? <BR> <BR>again, I do not changed the unicode or added new ligatures into fontlab.
  i just used the 2 standard ligatures in fontlab &#40;fi, fl&#41;.  <BR> <BR>thanks

    named characters automatically as ligatures, OpenType font or not. Well, perhaps
    it did not in ID 2.0 (or what was it, back 'den?)"

  body: "I'm sure InDesign (and Quark) use the fi and fl ligatures automatically if
    they are included in POSTSCRIPT TYPE 1 fonts.\r\nBut in OpenType fonts I guess
    you HAVE TO define the liga feature and include the ligatures there.\r\nFontLab
    does this automatically when importing Postscript Type 1 fonts as default - which
    may be the reason some of your fonts have this feature, but a font you've made
    all by yourself from scratch doesn't have it.\r\nCopying the glyphs from one font
    to another does not copy the OpenType features, so that explains why this doesn't
    work...\r\nSo make sure you make the liga feature before you export your OpenType
    font."
