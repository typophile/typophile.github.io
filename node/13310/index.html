<p>From what I can see, average development time inside of a foundry is right at about two years for the family. Including hinting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on several of my own bad ideas—privately—for over a year now. Type deign is never quick.</p>
<p>That being said, I hear that Jean-François Porchez works super fast. Ambroise was completed in three–four months. Sabon Next in under a year.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There&rsquo;s a difference between finishing a font [enough] to sell to users, versus demonstrating type design affinity -via a font- to a prospective employer. In the latter case, completeness is relevant only to the extent that it facilitates evaluation of your skills. So for example instead of spending X days to finish the smallcaps, it&rsquo;s smarter to spend part of that time doing <strong>some</strong> of the smallcaps and the rest of that time maybe showing good sensitivity towards extended-Latin accent placement. Now, you do want to totally finish the alphanumerics, and punctuation, and you do want to deliver finished base spacing, but you might forsake fully kerning UC-UC pairs for example, in favor of maybe showing your hinting or OpenType abilities, or making a prototype display/text cut of your base design, or maybe a smaller optical size, etc.</p>
<p>So the question -a really interesting and useful one- becomes:
What are the discrete affinities that a type designer needs to have/show?</p>

<p>i think that Hrant is right:

<p>so do you want to be a type designer? (i didn&rsquo;t understand that from the other thread)</p>
<p>if yes — in my opinion — go to Typecon; meet people. maybe you can start with Hallmark, for example,  and not type foundry (and later — join one).</p>

<p>Eric, sorry about my above comment. I was just responding to your first post and not your second. Of course, everything that Hrant just mentioned above is correct. To show off of typeface, you just need to make it look good in whatever your desired environment/application is.</p>
<p>To get a job, it might be good to show that you know things that are of interest to a specific foundry. This will of course vary from foundry to foundry. But OpenType subsitutions are pretty much being done everywhere, so that can&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>Are you coming to TypeCon? The best way to meet people and make contacts is, in my experience, at conferences. Conferences + Typophile is an unbeatable combination.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eric, I too am from Cincinnati. While I&rsquo;m not a professional Type Designer (I&rsquo;m working on the same goal). My first step that has opened a lot of doors for me is first and foremost: getting the hell OUT of Cincinnati.</p>
<p>I moved to New York almost 4 years ago from Cincinnati and many avenues that were once closed to me opened once I got out of that city. For example, I&rsquo;m going to TypeCon (which others have already suggested) the fact that I live in New York makes TypeCon a subway ride away from me. That is something that would not have been possible had I stayed in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Based on some things I&rsquo;ve seen you mention too Dan, it seems that a change of location can certainly start to open doors&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Eric, in terms of time to develop and design a type just let me insert a bit of historical stuff - Frederic Goudy designed, and in some cases cut the matrixes (matrii?) for 116 types in 48 years, so that is a bit more than 2 per year. Considering the complex job of matrix cutting, that constitutes a lot of work. These designs do include separate roman and italic types for such as Goudy Old Style, Garamont, etc. I suspect that Goudy worked quickly and was, of course, a man driven by type. This probably doesn&rsquo;t answer your question directly but might give you some perspective. And yes, a font is never really finished.</div>

It can be a basic Type 1/TrueType font, don&rsquo;t need no OT or CE.
That may not get you out of Cinci, but it&rsquo;s a concrete, real-world goal, and very doable.</p>
