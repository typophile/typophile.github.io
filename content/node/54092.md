    how easy that would be to tweak/modify, but it might be a starting point."

  body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nMiss Tiffany \r\nProbably
    I will do a 2d in final image, but thet ideia of the 3D is to experiment diferents
    shapes and sizes. This is easy to do with 3D. I can even try to do a small animation
    in order to get lots of frames and choose the best one!\r\n\r\naltaira \r\nThanks
    for the link. The \"Extrude Along Spline\" in 3D max seems the solution.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n"
