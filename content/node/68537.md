  body: "Hard to evaluate it without knowing more, such as how this illustration will
    be used. \r\n\r\nBut my offhand comment is that you're obviously a good illustrator,
    but the \"robbing the bank\" theme is hard to spot. Took me a minute to realize
    there was a broken piggy bank, and the princess' mallet is hard to see.\r\n\r\nMight
    be better if there was just one piggy bank -- the broken one -- instead of 3 banks,
    and if the bank was bigger or more obvious, and perhaps with the currency flying
    out of it instead floating some distance away. (I thought at first that the currency
    had come out of that open drawer.) And you might try turning the frog so it's
    body is pointing towards the piggy bank.\r\n\r\nHave you considered showing the
    moment the princess is actually breaking the bank (BAM!), or the moment before
    when she's swinging the mallet and we anticipate the bank breaking? "

  body: If she keeps the static pose, she should perhaps have the mallet on her <em>near</em>
    side rather than the far side, to make it more obvious to the viewer. The coin
    stacks are all the same, which looks too copied-&-pasted. Like the stark lighting
    style though.

  body: "> both the concept and the illustration david \r\n\r\nWhy did you say 'not
    the artist'\r\n\r\nI think the main issue is the composition & light. By light
    I mean length & direction of cast shadows, reflected light, highlight.\r\n\r\nYou
    don't need the red ( frog + princess)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    there faves\r\nlink below \r\n\r\nhttp://fav.me/d2nz140\r\n\r\n\r\n/_______________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI
    agree though on the light its not realistic or consistent. As an  1 example there
    are no lights casting on the frog and the curtains. Also the chair has darker
    edge on the front and this shoud b on the left hand side. may be thicker stoke
    line for foreground objects so they appear closer to would add a sense of depth
    ,\r\n\r\nthanks alot for you comments "
