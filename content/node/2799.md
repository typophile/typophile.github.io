  body: It&#39;s not a font. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/ultramodern-classic-sg/">Ultramodern</a>
    is similar as is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/binner/">Binner</a>.
    As far as I know, there isn&#39;t a font that looks exactly like or even close
    to your sample.

  body: 'Nice find. It&#39;s a bit crude, but reasonably close.  <BR> <BR>I just remembered
