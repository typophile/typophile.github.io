  to some specimens of this typeface called Apollo. I like the quirks that sets it
  apart from similar faces, the C in particular, with the top terminal cut horizontally
  and the bottom terminal cut at an angle. Has this typeface ever been digitized or
  revived under another name? I hadn\u2019t heard of it before."
