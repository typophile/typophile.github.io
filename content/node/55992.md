body: "I'm adding Opentype features to a font for the first time. I have already added
  two sets of alternates and a set of discretionary ligatures. Most of the ligatures
  I want are made and I would like to add accents on some of them using anchors. Here's
  an example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MultiLigature1_4990.gif]\r\n\r\nWhen
  I look at the preview, everything seems to be ok, but when I'm trying to generate
  composite, it doesn't work as you can see in the next picture. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MultiLigature2_4729.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  accents are positioned correctly but the ligature are replaced by both glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I'm trying to positioned the accent on the second letter within the ligature. The
  preview is still correct:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MultiLigature3_5884.gif]\r\n\r\nWhen
  I generate composite, the ligature is still replaced by both glyphs, the position
  of the accent is not above the right part of the ligature and is too low:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MultiLigature4_4634.gif]\r\n\r\nAnyone
  knows what I'm doing wrong\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRaphael"

  body: "As regards the wrongly placed accents (your last screenshot):\r\nIf you add
    a tilde before each accent name in your glyph composition text like\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>C_A+~acute=C_Acute</em>\r\nthis
    will prevent FLS5 from performing some positioning tricks. If you click the green
    button with a questionmark in it (bottom right of the <em>Generate Glyphs</em>
    ... dialog), a dialog will show some more information.\r\n\r\nAs regards decomposition
    of ligature into individual glyphs:\r\nFLS5's glyph generation mechanism has a
    built-in trick that, if you provide a glyph name that involves underscores like\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>C_A+dieresis</em>\r\nthen
    FLS will ignore the part after the '=' and instead use the 'components' as found
    in the 'C_A' name, i.e. 'C' and 'A'. I have not found a way to avoid this -- except
    for, temporarily, replacing the underscore in the ligatures' glyph names by another
    character or string."

  body: "I've tried to add the tilde before each accent name in the glyph composition
    text and it didn't work. But when I changed temporarily the glyph name for \u2019CA\u2019
    instead of \u2019C_A\u2019 the composite were generated perfectly. Of course,
    it's not the best solution because I have to rename each composite but at least
    it works.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "You could use a little script like:\r\n\r\nsr = (\"_\",\"!!!\")\r\n#sr =
    (\"!!!\",\"_\")\r\nfor g in fl.font.glyphs: g.name = str(g.name).replace(sr[0],sr[1])\r\nfl.UpdateFont(fl.ifont)\r\nprint
    \"done!\"\r\n\r\nCopy/paste into the Macros Panel. You'll need to replace typographic
    quotes by simple ones.\r\nBefore generating glyphs, run the script with the second
    \"sr = ...\" line commented out. After generating glyphs, run it again but with
    the first \"sr = ...\" line commented out. (Of course you'll need to do a search/replace
    in your glyph composition text too.)\r\n"

  body: "Regarding the script. I'm really not sure to get it, never worked with macros
    before. This script is made for renaming the font before generating composite
    and then renaming them again when the composite have been generated???\r\n\r\nI
    paste it in the macro panel, but as soon as I replace the typographic quotes by
    simple quotes the first line: \r\n\r\nsr = (\u201C_\u201D,\u201D!!!\u201D)\r\n\r\nbecomes
    red.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure either of what you mean by saying to run the script with
    the second \u201Csr = ...\u201D line commented.\r\n\r\nWell, I guess I still have
    a lot of reading to do about macros"

  body: "Ok Sorry about my last post. I may sounded really lost. After examining the
    script better I get it. It works!\r\n\r\nNow I do understand that the first line
    of the script says to replace underscore in all glyph names by !!!, and that the
    second line is says to replace !!! by the underscore. I also get what meant first
    line commented out.\r\n\r\nI'm still a bit lost when I try to understand what
    everything stands for in the last three lines of the script, but I'll try to sort
    it out.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for that scripting introduction. I understand that
    it can saves me a lot of time.\r\n\r\nRaphael"

    too, but because it is the more elegant solution on the font level (as to the
    ligatures shown above, the one-glyph solution is fine), not because of an editor's
    restrictions and so have my own method for glyph composition."
