body: "Hello typophiles:\r\nI'm writing the opentype code of a font, starting with
  ligatures I have some doubts about encoded ligatures and not encoded ones. In a
  previous thread http://typophile.com/node/35174 Miguel Sousa suggested to duplicate
  the encoded characters fi (FB01) and fl (FB02) for the liga feature and rename the
  duplicates as f_i, f_l. Then in small caps generate the glyphs fi.sc and fl.sc to
  replace fi and fl. And the OT code should look like this:\r\n\r\nfeature smcp {\r\nsub
  fi by fi.sc;\r\nsub fl by fl.sc;\r\n} smcp;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub f i by
  f_i;\r\nsub f l by f_l;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nMy question is what about the other encoded
  ligatures? I dont know what is better, unencode them or keep the encoding and duplicate
  them as suggested. I also have these characters: ff (FB00), ffi (FB03), ffl (FB04),
  s_t (FB06) and longs_t (FB05). I have decided to duplicated them but i don't know
  if it is the right decision, here are my glyphs and my code. Could you advice me?\r\n\r\nEncoded:
  fi(FB01), fl (FB02), ff (FB00), ffi (FB03), ffl (FB04), st (FB06) and longs_t (FB05)\r\nDuplicated:
  f_f, f_f_i, f_f_l, s_t, longs_t.hlig\r\nGenerated for smcp: fi. sc, fl.sc, ff.sc,
  ffi.sc, ffl.sc, st.sc\r\n\r\nfeature smcp {\r\nsub ffi by ffi.sc;\r\nsub ffl by
  ffl.sc\r\nsub ff by ff.sc;\r\nsub fi by fi.sc;\r\nsub fl by fl.sc;\r\nsub st by
  st.sc;\r\n} smcp;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub f f i by f_f_i;\r\nsub f i by f_i;\r\nsub
  f l by f_l;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nfeature dlig {\r\nsub s t by s_t;\r\n} dlig;\r\n\r\nhlig
  {\r\nsub \u017F t by longs_t.hlig;\r\n} hlig;\r\n\r\nAs for the uppercase forms,
  should I generate especial glyphs to substitute the enconded ligatures when the
  user changes the text from lowercase to all caps? Thanks in advance."

    ligatures.\r\n\r\nYou can encode (e.g.) your <code>f_i</code> ligature as UFB01,
    include a rule <code>sub f i by f_i</code>, and omit the duplicate <code>fi</code>
    character altogether. Note that either name (<code>fi </code> or <code> f_i</code>)
    is consistent with proper naming conventions (though personally I'd use the latter).\r\n\r\nIncluding
    capital versions of the ligatures is only necessary if you want to accommodate
    users who employ hard-coded ligatures in their text (something which I view as
    a bad practice).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    the distinction between character and glyph.\r\n\r\nHowever, Unicode accommodates
    many \"legacy\" typographic characters that were part of exisiting encodings --
    and so, because \"fi\" was part of, for instance, the Mac OS Roman encoding, it
    is given its own Unicode."

    the later is the case, then I see no point in having an fi.sc glyph at all, it
    is just redundant. you can instead say:\r\n<code>\r\nsub fi by f.sc i.sc;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nand
    the same goes for other similar ligatures."

  body: "<code>sub fi by f.sc i.sc</code> requires an application to support one to
    many substitutions which many currently do not.\r\n\r\nThe issue of small capital
    f_i, however, only arises where the user actually enters uFBO1 instead of simply
    entering the sequence f i. I'd hope that with the advent of opentype, few users
    are choosing to do this. Given a legacy text which includes hard-coded ligatures,
    I'd think the user would be better off doing a search-and-replace to fix so that
    spell-checking, hyphenation, etc. actually work properly anyway, so supporting
    smallcap (or all cap) versions of ligatures doesn't seem like it should be a priority
    when coding features.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Hi Andr\xE9, this is what M.Sousa says about  duplicating ligatures:\r\n\"The
    only reason why there's the need for smallcap versions of fi and fl is because
    they are characters, i.e. they have their own Unicode codepoints. In addition,
    these two characters are included in the MacRoman encoding and can be easily accessed
    from the keyboard, so there's a high chance to find them in texts.\"\r\nThansk
    Nick, that's why I'm thinking about removing the encodings of my ligatures.\r\nKhaled,
    good point, thanks.\r\nMr. Oldnick, I also would like to know about that, I think
    there isn't an uppercase form of long s."

  body: "Hi Eli!\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say the only encoded ligatures you should include
    are fi and fl, because there is a fair chance that in some texts they were set
    as one single character:\r\n\r\n(US keyboard)\r\n<code>alt shift 5 = \uFB01\r\nalt
    shift 6 = \uFB02</code>\r\n\r\n(Spanish ISO keyboard)\r\n<code>alt shift f = \uFB01
    \r\nalt shift g = \uFB02</code>\r\n\r\nDuplicate them as f_i and f_l is not mandatory,
    but doesn\u2019t hurt anyway, since this way you are not depending on the Mac
    OS Roman encoding.\r\n\r\nAt least, that is what I did for [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/estudio-ch/espinosa-nova/regular/characters.html|Espinosa
    Nova]] (check out slots 386, 387, 390 and 391).\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nAbout

    please Eli, let me see your typeface when it is done. I am intrigued about the
    long s. Are you working on an oldstyle typeface?"

  body: "Andr\xE9, I think the problem with encoded ligatures is that when you use
    them and make the feature liga with them you are not changing the glyph but the
    character itself and I think it can cause problems with your GSUB table, but I'm
    not sure about that.\r\n\r\nCristobal thank you for your clarification, I think
    I'm going to do what you did with your beautiful Espinosa Nova. Correct me if
    I'm wrong, the eszet is a ligature between long s and s, I don't know if there
    is a capital form of long s alone. You may want to have a look at these links
    for more comments about the capital eszet: http://www.flickr.com/photos/elibaal/5039507654/

  body: "My take is you grudgingly support legacy characters, you never encourage
    their use.\r\n\r\nWe don't sell fonts, we work them over only to set type. Maybe
    my views shouldn't count, then. But when I run into a font with a fi or fl character,
    (and a Unicode codepoint), I take them out. At some point, the fi character should
    be *deprecated.* Far as I'm concerned, that was as soon as we could employ a character-glyph
    distinction.\r\n\r\nAs for F_I ligatures, whether small or full cap, why? How
    many texts come to people who use type where that's been an issue? I've never
    seen one -- can somebody remember one, or is this just a theoretical exercise?
    \r\n\r\nWhat to do when small or full caps are both ligatures and letterspaced,
    esp. just below the point where any ligatures break into component characters?
    They're going to look dreadful. And both are commonly letterspaced.\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nI
    say let a text show .notdef and salmon for any fi/fl etc. characters. Fix that
    text then & there, and we've gotten rid of one more bum situation. "

    I like the one in this sign http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/5087231570/ as
    it looks like a real small letter (and does not look like a B or small beta either).
