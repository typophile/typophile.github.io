  is the personal website of [[Zara Evens]] and on occasion, one might find something
  worth reading. Updated only when the burning desire to write infects her, which
  is sometimes never, Zara's inability to construct a complete sentence in proper
  English, and her incomprehensible rambling on about unicorns, bar-room brawls and
  cashews, makes for mild entertainment in only the most secluded sectors of society.\r\n\r\nPoints
  of interest at <a href=\"http://www.commandzed.com\">CommandZed</a>: Really Sweet
  Syndication (I know you are addicted to RSS), Flickr-fed content (I know you are
  addicted to this too), and a poorly constructed, basic 2-column layout.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.commandzed.com"
