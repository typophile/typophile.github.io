body: "Guys, \r\n\r\nWhat do you think of pairing Helvetica (for titles) with Lucida
  Grande (for body copy)? My client thinks that at least we need to use Helvetica
  somewhere, since the logo is on Helvetica too. In the first iteration I used Museo
  Sans for the titles, which seemed a nice pairing with Lucida Grande to me, but it
  wasn't approved. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure of using Helvetica for the main body copy
  font; I found it just too much uninteresting, used everywhere, and lacks the humanist
  touch I want to achieve with this design (rounded corders, subtle shadows, etc.).
  Besides, Lucida Grande works amazingly well in 15px and 13px (and yet even in 11px!).
  It's very versatile.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a screenshot of this possible pairing.
  On left, the initial iteration, and on right, the one with Helvetica. I think it
  *could* work, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4838.png]\r\n\r\nBest,

  body: "I've been thinking about this sort of thing for quite a while. \r\n\r\nIn
    essence, the static closed grotesque forms of Helvetica are perfectly suited for
    headlines. They fill the surface, grabbing attention, forming an almost solid
    unit (the word). It is tightly spaced, has a huge x-height, tiny descenders and
    ascenders: perfect for stacking.\r\n\r\nLucida Grande on the other hand: a humanist,
    dynamic shapes, loosely spaced, open forms (and although not that dramatically
    different in vertical proportions -- let's for a moment think about the very concept
    humanist) is obviously rooted in the tradition of text type. \r\n\r\nThe two skeletons
    are from completely different spheres, and thus this pairing is against all [[http://typophile.com/node/21000|rules]].
    However, I think something like this is most sensible ... in theory. In practice,
    you need some echo of the first in the second. Preferably you'd also want a clear
    distinction between the two, not something so close it just looks like an error.\r\n\r\nSpinning
    off to fantasty land: What would a sans serif family with both stylistic and optical
    text (open, loose, distinct word images) and display (closed, tight, filling the
    page) sizes look like? \r\n\r\n"

    because it looks "blocky". I guess it''s not that bad to use this pairing, but
    again, would love to read other people''s thoughts too. '

  body: "I wouldn't pair those two myself (for the reasons Frode mentioned already),
    but as you write that you <em>have</em> to use Helvetica somewhere, I\u2019d say
    it certainly is a better choice for headlines than for text sizes. \r\n\r\nIf
    you can use a different typefaces altogether, I would go for <a href=\"http://www.webtype.com/store/search/?q=benton+sans\">Benton
    Sans</a> for heads and <a href=\"http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonsansre-family/\">Benton
    Sans RE</a> for reading sizes."

  body: The idea that you have to use Helvetica somewhere because the logo is set
    in it is the most suspect thing you posted.  In general, I would suggest the opposite
    - avoid diluting the brand mark by setting other text in the same font.  Just
    because someone is a great actor doesn't mean they should play the supporting
    role as well as the lead.

  body: "Luma: I disagree. I think that if you could reuse the typeface used on the
    logo, right in certain interface elements, this could be a nice approach to extend
    and reinforce the mark. For example, I've seen a couple of sites where the typeface
    used on the logo is also used in search buttons (for the \"Go\", \"Search\" labels).
    To me it has nothing to do with diluting.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Sorry, maybe my statement appeared too strong. I was trying to suggest that
    1) it is not mandatory to use the font elsewhere if it is the basis of the wordmark,
    and 2) the examples of this done well are more the exception in my asthetic.  I
    agree that it *could* be a nice approach, so I think we are on the same page.
