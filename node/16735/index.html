<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, I've never been on any type of forum before, but I am looking for some help. I'm attempting to translate a book entitled, Medula Mistica by Francisco de Santo Thomas. It was written in 1695. I cannot find it on the web. WorldCat shows only three copies in the world. One in Washington DC, one in Mexico, and one in Chile. I am attempting to purchase or borrow a copy of this book through the Carmelites in Washington DC. They photocopied a chapter for me and I have begun attempting to translate it. My problem is I am having difficulty reading the font. It appears to be in italics and difficult to make out the letters. For example, the letter "s" when not at the end of the word is in the form of an "f" without a crossbar through it. When using Microsoft word, in the "Insert" "Symbols" in the "Latin -Extended A" is a symbol shaped like this "f" without a crossbar.
Another problem in the print is that the accent marks appear to be just heavy dots instead of angled lines. Does anyone happen to have a "key" of somekind that would show 17th century Spanish letters = English letters? Is there such a thing as a 17th century font in Spanish.
Can anyone give me some help in translating this?
Thanks,
Pastor Rick </div>

<div class=commentbody>Rick,
the "f without a crossbar" is called the long s and was commonly used in the Latin alphabet until the 18th century, and also later in blackletter.
See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s
http://www.myfonts.com/unicode/017f/
If you use Microsoft Word for Windows, you can type it by typing 017f and pressing Alt+x after that. You can also assign a keystroke to it using Word's record macro function.
You did not indicate into which language you are translating. Also, I don't quite understand what you mean by a "key" that would show 17th century Spanish letters vs. English letters.
Regards,
Adam</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Adam,
Thanks for your reply. I checked out the links about and they are very helpful. I am translating from Spanish to English. And by key I mean something like the following for each letter of the alphabet:
Spanish = English
(symbol for long s) = s
It looks like www.myfonts.com might have that somewhere.
Anything else that you or anyone else might offer would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks again,
Rick</div>
