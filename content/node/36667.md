body: I've got a copy of the Precision Type Reference Guide, Dan Solo's book and some
  others. I'd like to add to the collection and have some questions. I've been looking
  to find a copy of the PLINC catalog. Someone is selling a vintage copy on eBay for
  $250. Is there any chance that House Industries would republish it? And Font Book
  sells for $100 in one place and $350 in another. Why is that?

    The one you see at Amazon is a probably a used copy of the older Third edition.
    No reason to pay that unless you want the very few fonts that aren't included
    in the expanded revision.\r\n\r\n> Is there any chance that House Industries would
    republish it?\r\n\r\nI don't think there's a very good chance of that at all.
    But they will be releasing the type soon in a very interesting way."

  body: The PLINC book should not be priced that high. They're all "vintage"!... Keep
    looking. I got mine last year for less than $40. There were a bunch of versions,
    so presumably the later ones have more in them.

  body: "Thanks for the answers.\r\n\r\nAnd Crossgrove you got the deal of a lifetime
    on that PLINC book. The value seems to be escalating. I hunted online for awhile
    yesterday and the average asking price seems to be between $200 to $300. But check
    out the [[http://www.biblio.com/details.php?dcx=118764189&aid=frg|Biblio.com listing]].\r\n\r\nI
    also came across this great list, [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/FontBookList.html|Bowfin
    Printworks Typographic References]]."

    way? http://typographica.org/000967.php Or have they spent the last three years
    working out an alternate way to sell fonts?\r\n\r\n"
