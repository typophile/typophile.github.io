  as to how production goes along.\r\n\r\n1) How do you typically create the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB
  file? Specifically, let's say that you're using Fontlab in names mode. What I've
  been doing is using the \"print all glyphs\" macro, then cleaning the text up by
  removing the line numbers. There has GOT to be an easier way to get a complete glyph
  list to create the DB, since I know something like the 3000+ glyph Arno Pro wasn't
  hashed out by hand the hard way.\r\n\r\nWhat program or command line program is
  the best solution? And what programming tools are useful in creating the basic file
  components used the creation of an opentype font via the AFDKO procedures laid out
  by Miguel Sousa at TypoTechnica?\r\n\r\n2) Just for practice, I'm trying to merge
  two ttf files together into one otf. One file is the standard U&lc and the other
  is the expert set with small caps. I'm looking at the mergeFonts tutorial, and it
  shows that I need to create a mapping file using, guess what, a glyph names list.
  \r\n\r\nAssuming I correctly map the names of the expert set, i.e., s to s.smcp,
  I should then be able to merge both fonts together into a single .otf file. That
  final otf file won't contain class metrics or features, but having all of the glyphs
  together in one file is a start. Am I correct in how I've interpreted the instructions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for all of the help!"

  body: "> <em>How do you typically create the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file?</em>\r\n\r\nWhat
    I usually do is to start with an existing GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file and add/remove
    entries as necessary. (For instance, the one used for Arno Pro was derived from
    the one used for Garamond Premier Pro, which in turn had been derived from something
    before). You can, for example, start with the sample file available in the FDK
    (FDK/Tools/SharedData/GlyphOrderAndAliasDB), or the one present in the ExampleRomanFonts.zip
    file. \r\nWhat we do at Adobe is a mix of using data from existing files, and
    running our own scripts on the file AGD.txt (FDK/Tools/SharedData/AGD.txt).\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    you can write your own, which sounds like what you're trying to do. Writing a
    GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file might require some hand work the first time, but the
    good thing is that once you have it you can use the same file for other projects
    (as is, or with minor changes).\r\n\r\nIf you're using Fontlab, what you can do
    is to switch to \"Index mode\", rearrange the order of the glyphs, and then run
    this little Python program,\r\n<code>for g in fl.font.glyphs:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print
    g.name\r\n</code>\r\nYou can then use the outputted list for building your own
    GlyphOrderAndAliasDB. For that, you will eventually need a good text editor and
    a spreadsheet program.\r\nIn case your final font does not require any glyph name
    changes --which means you're using final glyph names in the development process--,
    you can replace the second line of the code above by,\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print
    \"%s\\t%s\" % (g.name, g.name)</code>\r\nwhich will output two columns of glyph
    names.\r\n\r\nMakeOTF knows how to map standard glyph names --AGL glyph names
    and uniXXXX-style glyph names-- to Unicode values, so normally you won't need
    to have a third column in the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.\r\n\r\nAnother thing
    I normally do is to extract the second column of the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file,
    and use that data to create a FontLab encoding file (.enc). Then, in \"Names mode\",
    I use Glyph > Sort Glyphs > By Encoding, and upon switching to \"Index mode\"
    I get all the glyphs neatly ordered.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that it's not mandatory
    for the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file to have all the glyphs present in the source
    font. The data on that file is mainly used for controlling the glyph order on
    the final font, and to rename glyphs from production name to final (standard)
    name. If a glyph is in the source font but not in the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file,
    it will simply be put at the end on the final font, and its glyph name will remain
    the same. (NOTE: It's *highly* un-recommend, but MakeOTF will build your font
    even if the only entry in the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file is the '.notdef')\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    you can use the same GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file for your upright and italic fonts,
    even if their glyph set is not exactly the same. This allows you to maintain the
    same overall glyph order within all the fonts in the family. For example, in Arno
    Pro the italics have a bunch of swash glyphs which aren't present in the uprights.
    Nonetheless, the same GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file was used for both; MakeOTF simply
    skipped the entries that didn't apply."

  body: "> <em>Just for practice, I\u2019m trying to merge two ttf files together
    into one otf.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure mergeFonts works with TT or OT fonts. I
    believe it expects a name-keyed or CID-keyed Type 1 font, and it outputs those
    same formats. So, if you want to use mergeFonts to merge a \"basic\" font and
    an \"expert\" font into a single font, you need to convert the source fonts into
    Type 1 and then run this command,\r\n<code>mergeFonts output.pfa basicfont.pfa
    glyphlist expertfont.pfa</code>\r\n\r\nwhich will create the merged font (output.pfa).
    The <code>glyphlist</code> file is a simple text file containing entries for renaming
    the glyphs coming from the <code>expertfont.pfa</code> file. Its content can be
    something like,\r\n<code>mergeFonts\r\na.sc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmall\r\nb.sc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bsmall\r\nc.sc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Csmall</code>\r\n\r\nmergeFonts
    was created mainly for usage in CJK font development. The raw CID-keyed fonts
    used as source for the final OTF fonts are normally assembled by merging a few
    dozen Type 1 fonts, using mergeFonts."

  body: This past week I gave a workshop on using the [[AFDKO]] at the KABK and one
    student brought to my attention (thanks Ross!) that the FDK contains a FontLab
    named "Do Glyph Alias & Ordering". I honestly don't recall ever using it -- which
    explains why I didn't mention it earlier --, so I'm not sure what it does. That
    said, I encourage you to look at it, and report back with any suggestions you
    might have or bugs you may find. Thanks!

    familiar at all with a product called FontCreator.  FontCreator is vastly superior
    to anything put out by Fontlab.  I advise you to go to cnet.com and download a
    30 day trial copy and see for yourself. (And I most certainly do not work for
    the company.)
