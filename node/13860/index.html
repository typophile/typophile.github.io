To my eye, the only thing that looks off is the spacing on "Photography." The O-G-R-A needs to be opened up just a tad more.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the colors - black brown cream & white are a little too 'done' in the photography world. This was fashionable in '93.  I would choose different colors to be more distictive. I realize your is not the fashion business where you can be ( & should be ) black one moment & magenta the next - but even so. 

Galleries are always bloddy shirking the identity aspect ( YES, shirk!) and I cannot figure out why. Maybe it's a lack of cash... But it's like they all have to wear the same little black dress. Yes, it's fine but isn't there something more that could be done? Maybe this sounds too heavy. I hope not. I want to encourage. I really do.

I think the buying public has been in enough Pradas, Anthopologies, L'Occtaines and other chain boutiques with wild colors - so now - an art gallery - even a photo gallery can & should get do more. The bar has been raised! 

Chances are your customer has a vivid red, blue or green bedroom now. 

Do you see what I mean?

		<div class="commentbody">Actually as a gallery owner maybe you can speak a bit more about how you think about your business & its - identity - logo - colors - etc.  I was expressing some frustration - *but also my lack of insight*. I know thare is a minimalist tradition with art galleries in Soho NYC - but museums & galleries do seem to be moving away from black white & grey, classic serif fonts or classic sans serif fonts & finding other ways of 'framing' ( not literaly )  the art they present. How do you think about your business identity? How do you think about that 'framing'? What is their relationship?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not a gallery owner, just a photographer.  I started with that fisheye picture of the stairs on my home page as inspiration.  I pulled the colors from that.  I thought about the black/grey thing but I guess I thought the russet color would make it more distinctive.  

My business identity would be how I see my work.  I have a unique eye and I prefer simple compositions.  I don't shoot something because I think it will sell, but rather because I think it will be a good picture according to my standards. My Nantucket pictures have been described as evoking an earlier time here. My Texas pictures are more quirky. I do fine art photography only.

So I want to frame my pictures as my art, how I see things, and that I think they will stand on their own.  I want to show my work simply, without apology.  

You have made me think differently about this and I thank you for that.

		<div class="commentbody">Sharon,

The examples look very good. Great to see tasteful restraint - especially on the web - it's like balm for the eyes. I agree with Dan about the colour. Maybe the rounded shapes on the main page could be used in some way on the gallery pages to tie everything together.

I would suggest using the same typeface that you've used for Pearlstreet Photography for the navigation and any other text, but in upper and lower case. The benefits being a unified, strong look to the pages (which seems to be the effect you're after). A two typeface solution would be the way to go if there were pages with a lot of text, but from the examples you've posted I don't think this is the case.

Navigation wise, assuming that the two main sections of the site are Galleries and Contact I would be inclined to have a different type size for the gallery locations as they are a sub level of Galleries, and remove the coloured square from Contact. You could then use the two remaining colours to differentiate the gallery pages of the two locations. All you'd need would be another coloured square for Texas once you added it to the list.

Hope this helps

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the colour scheme, there's of course a reason why so many photo galleries use black/grey/white: it foregrounds the work. I'd agree with previous comments about sticking to a neutral colour scheme and let the work do the talking.

While I agree with Chris's thoughts on the typeface(s), I can understand that you may wish to use a second typeface apart from the Orator on a purely technical basis: to avoid having to set text as images. (Unless you are intending of working in flash that is.)
I like the Orator, and would say that any more-or-less 'websafe' type, whether sans (Arial, Verdana) or serif (Georgia, Courier), would do fine as a compliment. Since Orator is a typewriter font, perhaps Courier could be an interesting alternative?
You need to decide whether to use all-caps or not (compare the image caption with the section heading). Image caption, which is off-center, would perhaps be better left-aligned?

Are all your photos portrait format? If not so, it would be interesting to see how you treat a landscape/square format image.

You may be interested in looking at the work of <a href="http://www.adoptdesign.dk">adoptdesign</a>, who has made quite a few great gallery sites, for inspiration. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">To my eye the P of your logo looks a little condensed especially as an initial cap and the ST kerning could be a touch tighter. On the first page the menu seems too close to the logo. On the second the Title and the images don't seem to have a relationship to the russet block and the enlarged image, I feel that the image caption could be removed from the frame or the frame extended at the bottom to accommodate it, as it is a bit intrusive and the alignment is troubling. Try using one face (as recommended above) with upper and lowercase for the navigation and captions and solus uppercase reserved for the logo. The colours combine well and are dark/neutral.

I would have called my site more of a brown site than a gray or black site which are the colors I see in most of the photography sites.  It doesn't sound like that's how others perceive it though.  But I would agree that the design of the gallery page is lacking.  I'll work on that.

Thanks for all type advice.  I'll incorporate that this weekend.

Sharon, I'll be keen to see you continue to try things out. I mostly want to encourage you to find a design that isn't merely conventionally elegant but is harmonious with yourself & your clients. With yourself first & foremost. No matter what I like - or anybody else. I actually think that will improve business for you & make you happier too. 

Fredrick, APT is still in testing mode - I need to get access to a high end laser printer to do some final checking. Then I will probably get them out into the world with myfonts. </div>

Being slow exposure 5 seconds for 100 ASA color film I got great results from the wind blowing. It was the only February that I looked forward to the snow and wind.

As for your site, it begs the question, what do you want your viewers to notice? The site or the work. If its the work then make the site plain vanilla, if its the site then jazz it up.</div>

I also love the newest camera they have at Lomography, its a Chinese camera that has a rewind feature, designed for double exposures and best of all its all of about $50. My Zero 35mm Pinhole Camera (made of Teak and Brass) only cost me $140. They have great bargins there as long as you are looking for the unusual.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice shots, Dan!

I'm into the Lomo thing too, but I'm not sure about the rewind camera - why not just pick up a half-decent SLR, shoot a roll and manually rewind then shoot again to get your double exposures - then you're not stuck with something with a dubious lens on it! I recently dusted off my Minolta XG-M SLR, and am going to try and use it more, it fell out of favour because of my little Lomo, so I'm going to run some slide film through it, get them cross-processed (with white borders, natch) and see what I get. I think because shops are pushing digital, it should adversely effect the prices of old-school SLRs (I'm sure now's the time to try and get your mitts on an Olympus OM-1)

I think the Lomo thing is fuelled by shrewd marketing... I've got an LC-A but having bought my girlfriend the coloursplash, it's put me off the rest of their products, it feels nasty and the results haven't been great from ours (I should've bought the coloursplash flash for the LC-A instead). Having said that, I like what I've seen from your pinhole camera, nice distinctive results.

You might be able to answer this - what's the best slide film to run through an LC-A? I keep experimenting but each brand seems to give a particular cast to the prints, most seem to give a greeny cast to the prints, even when you've got a strong sky blue for example!

Sorry this post's gone so wildly off topic! Ahem... back to the typefaces...

		<div class="commentbody">I've read about the Lensbaby it sounds like fun. Sure Lomography is about selling products but they are also about old school photography. I have nothing against digital photography, it has introduced people to photography who might not have tried it because of film and processing. A percentage of people who shoot digital will get interested in the roots of photography and might even discover their creative roots in the media. I will check my site and see why The Gates photos aren't showing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>home.jpg</em>
The coloring system which based on dark background with a lighten object inside the design which looks like if it is the light source of all the design is very ok in my opinion with the photography issue. It reminds me of the old camera when you get inside dark room and see the world from a rounded lence. I guess it will not remind all people with same but I guarntee the eyefish picture which make person say what a strange prespective? is a good way to drive people more that site is about photographer even before we read the text.
But personally before I read the text, I felt that it is a site about decoration.. because the image it self is for an indoor well modern decorated space, may be the font also drive me so.
At this manner I will advice you to change the picture with something more imaginative .. may be the sky? may be a strange portrait? something say that you are into artistic thing done by photography?

I want to add that the white wall which has some value of lighten gray is not that rich color with browns and yellowish colors.. it looks alittle separated of the composition. may be the yellow light over is trying to break it.. and the dynamic curve of the form it colors makes a cool shock for the eye.. and make it move fast and dynamically inside the design, but I am still NOT 100% sure of it.

I think regarding you put your picture in a circle, and regarding there is no straight vertical line inside the picture neither a straight horiziontal line, there is a very dynamic movement for eye and you need a strong CROSSED lines in your design. You already made horiziontal lines by the type.. but the only strong vertical element is being driven for me by "P" letter, and the 3 squares under it.. try to make a long line in gray in vertical under that line and make sure it will have some empty space between it and the bottom edge of the design, and enjoy the stability.

I think the space between "T" letter (of word Pear Streer) and right edge is need to be more bigger just to give some air.

In fonts I am not 100% agree with makeing a  contrast between serif and sans serif fonts in this dynamic design, I think you may use 2 sans serif fonts ( to increas the feeling of modernism ) but make the contrast is based on its form, a font based on letters that are shorter than the other font as an example. photography word may need to have better appear and you may make it italic.

<em>Nantucketgallery.jpg</em>
This design is very prof. but I am still giving the same note & advice about fonts.

Thank you

		<div class="commentbody">I think you are all going to find me dull.  I can't seem to disconnect from my original design in any significant way.  When I started, I liked Bell Gothic for the Nantucket and Texas titles so I went back to that and tightened up the thumbnails a bit.  I incorporated the advice about the font on the galleries section of the home page but I'm not sure about Bell gothic there.  Once you choose a circle or square, you have built yourself a corral...at least for me it feels that way.  

Please let me know if the changes have totally missed the mark.  I haven't tried all the suggestions yet, especially the one about crossed lines on the home page.  I don't think I understand that one so any clarification would be great.

The gallery page is with the largest picture I would possibly use.
