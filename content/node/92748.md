body: "The following samples are from fictional ads from the game GTA: San Andreas.\r\nFor
  a modification for GTA IV, we are busy recreating some of these ads to a more high
  quality version. Of course we try to use the same fonts. We already have recreated
  several of these ads, but of the following ads, I have not been able to recognize
  the fonts being used. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Samples_3667.png]\r\n\r\nSample
  #2 reminds me of a font I ever had, but I can't recall the name and thus not check
  if it is the one being used.\r\nSample #3 is hard to identify due to only having
  these letters.\r\n\r\nCould you please help me with identifying these fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn"

    be sure for the \"MOTEL\" as the image contains only a few common letters,\r\nbut
    I think <strong>[[Frutiger Pro 77 Black Condensed]]</strong> is a close enough

  body: "Hi Fivos,\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply!\r\n1 looks very much like it, so
    I'll use that one. Also 3 looks okay to me.\r\nFor 2, Abadi is similar, but not
    a hit. I think I had this specific font on my previous installation, but I still
    wouldn't know its name.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help! Further suggestions
    for 2 are still open.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn"
