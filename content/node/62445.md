body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nCan someone please point me towards typefaces imitating (or
  close-ish to) those found in the 19th Century - particularly those of France (and
  Europe).\r\n\r\nI'm looking for serif typefaces than can be used for body text and
  headings, not script fonts. H&FJ have a couple of nice ones, but I would like to
  look around before deciding what to purchase.\r\n\r\nAbsolute accuracy to period
  is not vital - just something approximating it...\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nMartin"
