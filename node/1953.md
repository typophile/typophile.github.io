  body: I would start by throwing out the &#34;symbols&#34; labeled &#34;A&#34; and
    &#34;C&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#34;RAGIR&#34; is a complex name, in that there&#39;s no
    obvious linguistic assumption to make for pronunciation...that&#39;s coming from
    an English speaking perspective. Since &#34;CONSULTING&#34; is English, I assume
    that comment is applicable here. You may want to consider using some form of phonetic
    symbols. In fact, many of these symbols cross international boundaries...This
    may allow you to ditch the map altogether to create a purely typographical &#40;not
    topographical...he he&#41; brand mark. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: point taken scott. <BR> <BR>I used the symbols&#34; labeled &#34;A&#34; and
    &#34;C&#34;.  <BR>just to differentiate the different ideas that I am working
    on.  <BR>please inform me and euducate me on phonetic symbols.  My intentions
    are as you stated crossing international boundaries, with the identity marks.  The
    logo is for a friend that just started a translating business. English a Spanish,
    I want to achieve a minimal approach, however I don&#39;t thing that I am accomplishing
    my mission.  <BR> <BR>Please give me more feed back. <BR> <BR>sincerely; <BR>IN<img

  body: This could be a shipping company. A geological company. A computer company.
    <BR> <BR>I would focus on a mark that says <i>translation</i>, rather than one
    that says <i>international</i>. Harder maybe, but your result will be smarter
    if you can pull it off. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t know if you can do this, but consider
    suggesting CONSULTING change to TRANSLATION or LINGUISTICS or LANGUAGE SERVICES
    or nothing at all. Nothing would be just as informative as consulting. <BR> <BR>Best
    case scenario is a logo that shows the concept translation, and the word Ragir.
    That&#39;s it! <BR> <BR>Good luck. <BR>Randy

  body: I&#39;d definitely agree with Randy about the shift from &#34;CONSULTING&#34;
    to &#34;TRANSLATION&#34;. The only thing I can think of that might salvage using
    &#34;CONSULTING&#34; is to make the word somehow represent translation...maybe
    show the word in both English and Spanish. <BR> <BR>I think my suggestion of using
    phonetics with &#34;RAGIR&#34; is even more appropriate for a translation company
    &#40;Although there is some fun irony in a translation company having a name that
    is difficult to pronounce&#41;. This may allow you to use the word independent
    of &#34;CONSULTING&#34; or &#34;TRANSLATION&#34;. Phonetics has to do with sound
    and saying words correctly...things that a translator should master. To view phonetic
    symbols pick up any dictionary. These are the symbols used in the pronunciation
    keys of every word in the dictionary. If you&#39;re on OSX, then look at the dictionary
    in Sherlock. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott
