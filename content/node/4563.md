body: Dear All, <BR> <BR>I am trying to identify the type used on a couple of the
  pages contained in the Anna Piaggi book &#34;Anna Piaggi&#39;s Fashion Algebra&#34;.
  I think the material was originally published in Vogue sometime in the 1970&#39;s
  or 1980&#39;s - but then I don&#39;t know a great deal about fashion! <BR> <BR>Thank
  you very much. <BR> <BR>Grant <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34849.jpg"
