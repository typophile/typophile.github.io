  body: "These are good shapes. I think your main trouble is deciding where to put
    the little double barbs:\r\nLeft side of the first vertical of most letters: normal.\r\nMaking
    diamonds on the N: clever.\r\nOne on the thins of V and X: okay.\r\nRight side
    of M and W: unusual, unnecessary, but potentially defensible as a sort of bracketing
    device. \r\nRight side of other letters: hmm, no.\r\nClustered all over the middle
    of W: what, no.\r\nZ: It's more of a tail than a structural vertical, so still
    a weird place for them.\r\n\r\nMoving on to overall letter form, Y is where you
    seem to have lost the plot. It's cut and pasted together a bit hastily as if you
    have no historical references for the letter Y. The inline element is reversed.
    Then with Z, you reverse the stroke angle on the bottom, which is sort of interesting
    but makes the thin line look even more out of place. Keep drawing."

  body: Great. Do you think the curves are smooth enough?

  body: Yeah, you have smooth curves well in hand. The curls are super. I see a little
    awkwardness in S and the tail of Q, but I think that's more a matter of weight
    and composition, not smoothness.

  body: I don't see a newer image.  I really like the set shown in the May image!  I
    agree that the tail of the Q is too plain; it just sort of rams into the body
    of the Q.  Maybe an overlapping swath, such as appears at the bottom of many of
    your vertical stems (like at the bottom of B)?
