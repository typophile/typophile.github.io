  body: Of course, but Jef is a co-creator of the <i>Macintosh</i>, which is a lot
    more than just the GUI idea.

    a hole where water spurts out of. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the poor guy just died, so
    maybe I should&#39;ve waited until tomorrow. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, when you die we&#39;ll all have great insights about your visionary
    life and pretend you never did anything that was less than amazing. Surely you
    remember the gushing about Reagan, even from his former mortal enemies.

  body: 'Very sad about Jef Raskin. <BR> <BR>The short story re Raskin and the Mac
    GUI: Raskin&#39;s idea for the Mac was very different from how it turned out.
    He imagined something much simpler and cheaper. The PARC-like GUI stuff &#40;including
    the mouse&#41; was the result of Jobs taking over the project. Raskin left not
    long after. He later designed a computer for Canon called the Canon CAT which
    was more like what he had in mind for the Mac.'
