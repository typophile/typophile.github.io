body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm designing my first web site in flash and was hoping you would
  all know of a good sans serif font to use for it.\r\n\r\nThe site is a portfolio
  and needs to be professional looking. The contents include graphic design work,
  artwork, resume, and contact info. The font is dark gray and active page links are
  orange with size ranging from headlines (30 pt?) to body text like the resume (10
  or 12 pt?). The site has a faded picture of the sky as the background (which I may
  add animated film grain/static to later) and the site has a very light feel to it.\r\n\r\nI'm
  thinking something similar to Futura, but find Futura medium doesn't look right.
  GeoSans Light is nice but is too light- wish they had a book or medium version.
  Not sure about which fonts are best for use on the web that would fit the feel of
  the site.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your recommendations!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!!\r\n\r\n"

  body: There aren't very many good typefaces built for screen, at least not for text
    sizes. Verdana or Arial comes to mind. The new Vista-fonts (those five starting
    with a c) are also especially designed for on screen reading, I think.

  body: I just read that Avenir Next is hinted for on screen use! It is a wonderful
    typeface. I'm guessing there are others out there as well.

  body: You're right, the new Vista fonts are really pretty. I'm a Mac user, and I
    tend to disregard anything Microsoft does, because it's usually a poorly done
    copy of something Apple did years ago, but I have to hand it to them on their
    new font family.

  body: "Thanks for your responses!\r\n\r\nI've looked into the fonts you both mentioned
    and like the Avenir Book or the Corbel Regular (a vista font). I don't have access
    to either one of them to see how they'll look on the web site I'm doing. Before
    purchasing, I am concerned about whether they will look right in the context of
    the site.\r\n\r\nI really like Geo Sans Light for the feel of the site but also
    know it's too light in weight. I've pasted it below.\r\n\r\nDo you know if there
    is a font that very similar to Geo Sans Light but that is a book, medium or regular
    weight? (Wasn't sure whether Avenir Book or Corbel Regular were similar to Geo
    Sans Light in this way but thought maybe there's something even more similar?)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/menu_3602.jpg]"
