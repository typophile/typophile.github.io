  body: It appears to be handlettered. The repeated characters are all unique.

  body: Can you post the original photo that hasn't had the levels pushed to just
    black and white. We can't really tell from this what the age of the sign is. The
    irregularities could be because it is hand painted but it might be poorly-cut
    vinyl, or simply due to extreme adjustment of the photo.

    sign is routed wood or molded resin but my boss took the photo so i haven't physically
    seen it.  all the details of it are relief that've been hand-painted. thanks!\r\n\r\n"
