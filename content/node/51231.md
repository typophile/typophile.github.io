  The font for the coordinates\r\n2. The font for the text West Spit, Poniya Point
  and Cape Tupinier, which I think is the same for all these\r\n3. The font for depth
  indication. Now, those that are along the isowhatever lines look like Amerigo BT,
  but the ones out on the sea look like something else. Any suggestions for ahy of
  the two?\r\n4. The font for Lagoon\r\n5. The font for elevation. It looks like Soo,
  which I've used for the scale but it's not it\r\n\r\nI'm crating this in Inkscape
  in order to learn it a bit better and I guess once I'm finished I may have it printed
  in poster size to hang on my wall. :)\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any help and suggestions."
