  of Andron. It\u2019s the field of rather highly specialized typesetting in the humanities
  and I\u2019d like to provide a forum dedicated to the users, where they can discuss
  experiences and questions, work samples and so on. \r\n\r\nWhat might be the most
  suitable basis for such a site? Facebook? Google groups? A seperate domain?\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts welcome."

    Could you describe it a bit more, and perhaps give us a link?\r\n\r\nRegarding
    a forum platform: Google Groups seems to work well for communication among relatively
    technical users. A Facebook group could be alright, especially for more technically
    naive users, but FB use tends to be seen as fairly personal and noncommercial.
    Another idea is a web forum, although I tend to hate the things myself.  The answer
    probably lies in what the Andron user base already uses: you want to make a forum
    easy to access, with few barriers. That's more important than finding some supposedly
    perfect system.\r\n\r\n--John"

    people who like Andron but are not user (like me) can also follow it.\r\n\r\nI
    begun to build a site with Adobe Business Catalyst. This solution is more expensive
    and would take more work to be made, but let you produce exactly what you need."
