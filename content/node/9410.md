    have a page with the EULA and then they have a \"picture pages\" version that
    spells it out with the use of visual aids.\r\n\r\nP22 EULA: http://www.p22.com/support/license.html\r\nP22
    \"Spell it out\" EULA: http://www.p22.com/comlicensing.html"

  body: "Of course. This is something we discussed last year at TypeCon and ATypI.
    \r\n\r\nIsn't the problem really similar to the idea of font piracy in general?
    People either want to do what is right or they don't. If someone really does care
    enough to do what is right and doesn't understand the EULA they will take the
    steps necessary, ergo pick up the phone, to understand it."

  body: "I don't think anything having to do with humans can be so black-and-white.
    Different people have different breaking points, and the software EULA is far
    beyond the tolerance of most any human, which means virtually nobody reads the
    crap. This is exactly why the \"simple EULA\" is such a humanly effective idea;
    but <strong>only</strong> if the company providing it has good intentions, which
    is uncommon; good intentions -I mean at the company level, not the individuals
    working there- can certainly never be found in a company run by share-holders.\r\n\r\n>
    pick up the phone\r\n\r\nYou really think a phone conversation can solve the central
    problem?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Ok. So I generalized a teensy-tiny bit. You are right everyone has their
    own agency to pick and choose the point at which they will or won't follow [insert
    what they follow here]. \r\n\r\nI've had my own experience with not understanding
    a EULA and calling the foundry for clarification. I do think a phone call can
    help clarify things. "

    their lawyer) or an invoice if you diverge from their EULAs too much ;-)\r\n\r\nCalling
    is definitely a good idea, but be sure to get at least an email providing written
    permission for what you're planning to do.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    <i>things</i> (other than some consequence). How is the reality?

    following Tuesday. If you're in town you should definitely stop by. \r\n\r\nMost
    of the letters I've seen seem polite but firm. If the letter is coming from a
    law-firm rather than a type designer or foundry employee then I suppose there's
    a threat in there. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: We updated the P22 EULA to try to clarify things, but it still causes confusion.
    We considered a more detailed version that spells out every possible scenario,
    but that is impossible. The Commercial Licensing web page was simply an attempt
    to show examples of where a basic license was not sufficient for a user (or group
    of users). The bottom line is that fonts are tools for designers to use. We don't
    want to hinder that. If there is any confusion, a quick email usually get a reply
    the same day.
