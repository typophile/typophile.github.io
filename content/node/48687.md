  my great collaborator and friend, and I are working on a paper for the upcoming
  SECAC (Southeastern College Art Conference) conference here in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.unc.edu/~rfrew/SECAC/\r\n\r\nOur
  \"paper\" is revisionist history of graphic design, specifically we are re-writing
  the notion that our history\u2014the history of typography and, therefore, graphic
  design\u2014was made on the fossils of dead, white, western European males.  To
  do this we have video interviewed a dozen practitioners, ages 21 through 96, living
  and working in south Louisiana.  We call this our \"design giant\" project, because,
  we believe there are so many unsung heros of type and design, someone should start
  to document them.\r\n\r\nThe video will be fifteen minutes in length, edited from
  about a dozen hours of audio and video capture.  While writing the \"hard-copy\"
  (the actual paper to be published by SECAC as the product of this conference) I
  have been looking up the definitions of \"design\".  The idea of controlling order
  and making choices is a common theme in these definitions:\r\n\r\nPhilip B. Meggs,
  Alston W. Purvis, Meggs' History of Graphic Design, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &
  Sons, 2006, Preface vii.\r\n\r\n\"Since prehistoric times, people have searched
  for ways to give visual form to ideas and concepts, to store knowledge in graphic
  form, and to bring order and clarity to information.  Over the course of history,
  these needs have been filled by various people, including scribes, printers, and
  artists.  It was not until 1922, when the outstanding book designer William Addison
  Dwiggins coined the term 'graphic design' to describe his activities as an individual
  who brought structural order and visual form to printed communications, that an
  emerging profession received an appropriate name.\"\r\n\r\nSusan Yelavich edited
  by Stephen Doyle, Design for Life, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum and Rizzoli,
  1997, 12.\r\n\r\n\"Design\" is both a verb and a noun.  For this reason, the Museum
  [Cooper-Hewitt] has always been as interested in the process of design as in the
  end result.  Those results\u2014the ordinary objects that we all use to both survive
  and enjoy life\u2014are preserved to understand the past and hopefully to make the
  future better.\"  Diane H. Pilgrim, Introduction, 8.  \"The act of designing is
  carried out in many different ways, from the personal choices we make ever day when
  we set the table or plant a garden, to the collective decisions made in the marketplace
  of at a city hall.  Because it occurs on many different levels, employing different
  processes and degrees of expertise, design can be understood variously as craft,
  style, engineering, invention, planning, refinement, as an exercise in taste or
  an act of choice.\" \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marks_5667.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
  addition to order, idea/concept and communication, the word \"mark\" comes up periodically.
  \ The above picture is of marks made in the early morning dew on the window opposite
  where I write.  Tree frogs leave these marks while feasting on bugs attracted to
  the light, I've watched a frog turn a 360 degree aerobatic leap to nail a tiny moth.
  \ Is the frog conscious of the mark it makes?  Does it exist once the dew evaporates?\r\n\r\nRichard
  Hollis, Graphic Design; A Concise History, Thames & Hudson Inc, 2002, 7.\r\n\r\n\"Graphics
  can be signs, like the letters of the alphabet, or form part of another system of
  signs, like road markings...Graphic design is the business of making or choosing
  marks and arranging them on a surface to convey an idea.\"\r\n\r\nOur friend's Jack
  Russell terrier \"marks\" the perimeter of our yard when she visits.  In \"Never
  Cry Wolf\" by Farley Mowat, he describes the behavior of wolves marking then re-marking
  their territory when competition pushes the boundary.  When we author something,
  are we merely marking it as our own (as if to say, \"this is my idea\".)\r\n\r\nPrinters
  and book sellers have been the scoundrels of intellectual property (The Statute
  of Anne, published 1710, the first copyright law: \"An Act for the Encouragement
  of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers
  of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned.\"  http://www.copyrighthistory.com/quotations.html.)
  \ If you really read the statute it appears the stationers (printers) managed to
  keep a hold of some of the rights for reproduction of other people's property (authors),
  just in a more convoluted manner.  Are we just pirates appropriating concept and
  meaning and making it into forms that please us or suit a personal need?\r\n\r\nPhilip
  B. Meggs, Alston W. Purvis, Meggs' History of Graphic Design, Fourth Edition, John
  Wiley & Sons, 2006, Preface vii.\r\n\r\n\"Since prehistoric times, people have searched
  for ways to give visual form to ideas and concepts, to store knowledge in graphic
  form, and to bring order and clarity to information.  Over the course of history,
  these needs have been filled by various people, including scribes, printers, and

  Dwiggins coined the term 'graphic design' to describe his activities as an individual
  who brought structural order and visual form to printed communications, that an
  emerging profession received an appropriate name.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I liked when
  we were responsible for the product of our thoughts, when we were craftsmen and
  women, our work unmediated by anything more complex than a simple tool\u2014\r\n\r\nJeffrey
  L. Meikle, Design in the USA, 2005,14, 15.\r\n\r\n \"...design emerged during the
  Industrial revolution.  Before then, an artisan labored by hand to produce an object
  whose outline was set by tradition but whose final form varied according to imperfect
  materials, minor accidents in working with materials, and a customer's wishes.  An
  artisan's intention moved from mind's eye through hand's motion to the shaping of
  a physical object.  This simple process, involving minute variations in oft-repeated
  motions under the intuitive direction of a single individual, yielded to a more
  complex process when the factory replaced the workshop, when production of a series
  of nearly identical objects replaced the fashioning of unique artifacts.  The task
  of planning and conceiving work was separated from the task of carrying it out.
  \ An new type of worker, the designer, devised two-dimensional patterns or three-dimensional
  prototypes to be copied by other workers using precise machines.\"\r\n\r\n\u2014when
  what I made with my own hands defined my vision, and success.  Somehow, being that
  little tree frog, jumping wild, aerobatic loops getting supper seems more noble
  than dancing my fingertips along an illuminated piece of equipment writing digital
  words."

    labels designed by Burkey Belser (I think it was printed in CA or Step). He wrote
    it when he was railing against postmodernism, and used the review to explain that
    because the definition of graphic design had changed, he would begin referring
    to himself as an information architect. I also think that some perspective from
    designers who do 3D works (Sagmeister) would add to this.\r\n\r\nThat said, I\u2019m
    very interested in seeing your history. Design history is too focused on the famous
    standouts in New York and Europe. We really need perspective into everything else.
    I would love to see a design history book that just ignores everything that happened
    in New York in the Twentieth Century!"

  body: "James,\r\n\r\nWhen I first started teaching I had an argument with one of
    the old white elephants about something similiar to the comment from Vignelli.
    \ I included information architecture into design and the long-tooth freaked out.
    \ He would not accept it.  We had great copies of the best Swiss school, international
    style posters on the walls in that lab\u2014new computers, (almost new software)
    and drafing tables.  I loved that teaching lab.  However, Professor Dave, as he
    was/is called (the guy with the too open shirt revealing a once expansive chest
    and \"surfboard\" dangling from a thong around his neck) refused to allow me the
    teaching of one of the most improtant disciplines in our field\u2014the order
    and discemination of information.\r\n\r\nLiz Danzico, AIGA, is just now heading
    up a new MFA program at SVA.  To me, she is this new/old breed of designer.  SHe
    understands the power of information and how to craft it into accessibility.\r\n\r\nEliason,\r\n\r\nThank
    you so much for theis great Eames piece, much juicy quotes to use.  One or another
    will be my lead quote in the history paper.  \r\n\r\nWhen it is done I will post
    it here."

  body: "You're very welcome. If you can get your hands on it, the film that was made
    from that interview (\"Design Q & A,\" I think it was called) is charming, as
    are all those Eames movies. Don't know how far along your own video is, but it
    might even useful to either incorporate bits of it into yours, or even pattern
    yours after it - a kind of revisionist update that pays homage to the old in its
    form. \r\n\r\nEdit: [[http://www.amazon.com/Films-Charles-Ray-Eames-4/dp/B00004Z4UZ|the
    film is available on DVD]], looks like."

  body: "dear eliason,\r\n\r\nthank you for all of this information.  daniela, my
    colleague, is a huge eames fan.  of course i appreciate all of the work charles
    and ray did and what they mean but daniela is the big booster.\r\ni am delighted
    to be able to pass on this information.  for SECAC we are editing a short piece,
    but, as the project grows we hope to make the scope of the film broader as well.
    \ so even if we can't use it right now (i bet we can) it is of great value.\r\n\r\ni
    just looked at your profile (is this intrusive?) and note that you are in minnesota.
    \ this is a long shot, however, i am seeking funding for a scandinavian-american
    commercial artist research project and am looking for anyone who could point me
    in the right direction for a scandinavian-american foundation that funds research
    in the arts.  i am taking the liberty to email you directly about this too.\r\n\r\nagain,
    thank you for this great eames input.\r\n\r\noh, are you familiar with the website
    that chronicles every film ever produced in which a minox (or mini camere) can
    be sighted?  i made a loop of it and will try to attach it in my email to you."
