  I had to hand write my name. I'd like to figure out the font and be able to print
  a new tag with my name like everyone else's. If you have seen this one, please let
  me know :)

    a bit of embarrassment (on Typo-L) when I expressed that some of their fonts were
    illegitimately based from ITC designs, only to learn that they were in fact authorized
    derivations.\r\n\r\nBTW, many of us have been suffering spam \"false positives\"
    lately. I know it's frustrating when you lose a long, perhaps emotionally-charged
    post, but that's not my doing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    design now belongs to Agfa (which means it doesn't belong to CastCraft). It's
    hopeful that Paratype -being an honorable operation- actually acquired the formal
    rights to make Mania*. But frankly even if they didn't, personally I'd rather
    see people support an honorable foundry than merely save $25.\r\n\r\n* http://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?search=Mania&fcode=DA_MNA\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Firstly, Castcraft is now defunct - and, before they made OptiIzara and OptiZara
    digitally, they were part of the cycle of photo type makers (including Compugraphic)
    ripping each other off with clones.\r\n\r\nParatype sells all sorts of Western
    fonts they have no legitimate rights to. They say, \"Created by (some Russian
    font maker)\" and then (to their credit)  say, \"similar to (font x by designer
    z). I'm sure it's wonderful to their Russian market that the font is available
    digitally with Cyrillic glyphs- but the original font was Western and, in some
    cases, still ethically (forget about legally ...) wrong to clone. An Othmar Motter
    font, <a href='http://www.paratype.com/asearch/default.asp?search=motter&params=1&x=0&y=0'
    target='_blank'>Motter Tektura</a> <em><a href='http://www.motterfonts.com/' target='_blank'>comes
    to mind</a></em>. There are plenty of other examples, but, unfortunately, I haven't
    the time to lay them out now.\r\n\r\nParatype has no rights to their \"version\"
    of this. Nevertheless, you urge folks to give them $25 (It's commercial. It must
    be good!) rather  than risk an offense against another defunct foundry (Compugraphic
    > Agfa)."

  body: "First off: anything I ever write is simply my opinion. Just because I've
    been on Typophile a long time doesn't mean I have any authority over you. The
    only thing I'm an authority on is being myself.\r\n\r\nMike, I'm glad your post
    ended up going through.\r\n\r\nAre you sure Motter Tektura is illegitimate? Or
    is it simply a logical suspicion (maybe like the ones I had back on Typo-L)? And
    are of you a mind that if somebody does something wrong any other deeds that are
    actually good don't count? Lastly, Agfa might no longer <em>market</em> fonts
    (and only at this moment...) but that doesn't mean they no longer <em>own</em>
    them; they could still make money from selling those rights. Don't get me wrong,
    I don't think either Compugraphic or Agfa have always behaved like saints (for
    one thing the latter manufactured chemicals used by the Nazis). But what good
    has CastCraft done? And why is a shopper saving some money the most important
    factor?\r\n\r\nI'm simply trying to navigate these gray waters, in the context
    of Typophile. And for the record, I'm no fan of Capitalism, and not offending
    corporations isn't high on my list of priorities. It's about us, not them.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    posters get hit with the spam tag, I stupidly figured that you, Hrant, had (indirectly)
    gotten us muzzled. Yes, I know you claim no desire for such censorship.\r\n\r\nConsidering
    the recent spam problems on the forums, a light bulb should have gone off in my

    sorry for the personal attack related to this and I'm going now to edit that post

    be disciplined on one occasion (and it wasn't on Typophile). To be candid though
    I'm now reconsidering that philosophy (although it has nothing to do with you).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I edited it for your sake, not mine. I didn't want you to come off in that
    light in that post in the future. The Web being forever, and all.\r\n\r\nI have
    three points to make in a short amount of time ...\r\n\r\n1) You are going well
    beyond expressing your opinion. You are telling folks how to post and what guidelines
    they should use. As has been seen already, this is having a stunting effect on
    some already conscientious identifiers who don't want to offend you. That is the
    effect a bully has.\r\n\r\n2) Paratype's Mania (designed in 1994 by Alexey Chekulaev
    ... right.) appears to be highly derivative of Phil Martin's <a href='http://www.fontfactory.com/font_info.php/font_id/13997/search/1/mode/0/search_text/corporate/page/6'
    target='_blank'>Corporate</a> rather than Zarana. The Font Company offered it
    as a font with a lowercase that comrade Chekulaev partially borrowed from.\r\n\r\nIn
    a <a href='URL' target='_blank'>2004 interview</a> with Mark Simonson, Phil Martin
    admits without apology to using and modifying the fonts of other photo-lettering
    entities. He had   some nice original creations, but most of his fonts were derivative
    in a way you would surely disapprove of today. Was Corporate derived from Zarana?
    Possibly, but who knows.\r\n\r\nDifferent eras and standards. Which plays a big
    part in ...\r\n\r\n3) I think our main difference is in the the fact that we both
    claim to hold font designers in the highest esteem - and yet we disagree mightily
    about what that entails. I will try to elaborate when I can next post.\r\n\r\n"

    disagree on is how much effort we should make in keeping/making Typophile friendly
    to the makers of type. The fact that I'm one of the extremely few type designers
    who now sets foot in the ID section (while in the past type experts like Stephen
    Coles and Yves Peters were regular IDers) I feel speaks volumes about how the
    ID section has been treating us.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
