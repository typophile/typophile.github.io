body: "I need to design a manual for a company that I work for. The subject matter
  is quite dry; surveying, sampling and data collecting protocol for a mining company.
  I am going to try to make it a bit more interesting with diagrams, and photos.\r\n\r\nWhat
  might be a good font choice for this sort of document? I was thinking of Minion
  Pro, but would like to have something that has more of a modern feel..\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    compactness... however Minion is a good choice tho, but you might like Karmina
    too (it has a little more personality without giving up the efficiency): http://www.type-together.com/Karmina\r\n\r\nI
    almost forgot\u2014FF UNIT. This font is dead center neutral and is compact too:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=unit&x=0&y=0\r\n\r\nMikey
