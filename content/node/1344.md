  I&#39;ve always seen typography as the upper echelon of design... and I find it
  a little intimidating. <BR> <BR>Anyway... on to my post. I&#39;ve been running a
  graphic &amp; web design business for a little over two years now and I&#39;m in
  need of a makeover for my site and identity. You can view what I have now here:
  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.31threedesign.com" target="_blank">http://www.31threedesign.com</a>
  <BR> <BR>I want to start with a new logo but I&#39;ve had a real hard time finding
  the right font to use, mainly because of the shape of the word and the fact that
  it begins with the number 3. <BR> <BR>This is something that I&#39;ve been thinking
  of using... but it&#39;s still lacking in something. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16523.gif"
  alt="31three logo"> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a modified bank gothic. I&#39;ve very open
  to suggestions and modifications. The illustrator file is <a href="http://www.31threedesign.com/31three.zip">here</a>
  for those who like to mess with stuff. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not trying to get you to
  do my work for me... I&#39;m just really stuck and need some help to get me rolling
  in a new direction. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Jesse BC'

  body: I think there might be a problem with people trying to read it as one of those
    funky number/letter swapping things, you know what I&#39;m talking about? But
    this isn&#39;t like that, and it would throw them off. Maybe put some kind of
    separation between &#34;31&#34; and &#34;THREE&#34;. <BR> <BR>The &#34;R&#34;
    doesn&#39;t seem to be working. <BR> <BR>I think you should shear the terminals
    of the &#34;3&#34; horizontally. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Jesse: <BR> <BR>The first thing that comes to mind is to reverse the &#34;E&#34;
    to create the three. this will begin to help with the shape of the word. Next
    I might try combining the &#34;1&#34; and &#34;T&#34; using the left arm and stem
    of the &#34;T&#34; to create the &#34;1&#34;, while separating &#40;through space
    or color&#41; the right arm of the &#34;T&#34;. As for a type recommendation,
    I would probably look for something less soft &#40;less rounded corners&#41; to
    correlate with the forwardness of the title. <BR> <BR>Of course, this is just
    what I might try. I wish you luck coming to the perfect solution. I&#39;m sure
    you&#39;ll get a lot of valuable assistance from some typophiles who are much
    more qualified than  I am. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: 'One possibility is that the difficulty you are having comes from the fact
    that the &#40;arabic&#41; numerals and &#40;roman&#41; letters have a different
    inner logic &amp; rules of thick-thin contrast.  <BR> <BR>If this is the case,
    then you might find a solution by making the numerals more different and contrasting,
    using weight, style, color etc., rather than more similar. You could also try
    separating them by a dash, dot, etc. <BR> <BR>I can see that you might improve
    on the current logo on your web site, but it does go the contrast/separation route.
    Maybe another solution on that same route will work for you.  '

  body: I had a minute to checkout your site today. I love the simplicity of it and
    you&#39;ve done some very nice work. Have you considered dropping the numeral/letter
    approach altogether? I was drawn to the &#34;31:3&#34; on your portfolio page.
    It reminds me of traditional chapter:verse referencing. Considering the style
    you seem to convey through your work, I think this is an approach you could pull
    off very well. <BR> <BR>31:03, &#40;31:03&#41;, [31:03], etc

  body: Hi Jesse,  <BR> <BR>I agree with Joseph. I also visited your website and it
    seems to me that you have a very &#39;classical&#39; style. If this is your strength,
    use it. If not, and you want to reach also a younger audience, then change it.
    <BR>But don&#39;t change it that much. My advice is to keep it still a little
    bit classical. That&#39;s what seems to be your strength. <BR> <BR>I like the
    idea from Scott to use the 31:3. Or use the 3 as an &#39;E&#39;. <BR> <BR>Regards,

  body: Thanks for all the input guys... this really is a great forum. I&#39;m curious
    about using the 31:03 or 31:3 however the registered name of the business is actually
    31three. I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ll start getting cheques made out to 31:3...
    which would be a hassle. 31:Three might help me out though. The name is actually
    based on Exodus 31:3. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=EXOD%2B31%3A3-4&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;x=8&amp;y=6"

    a beautiful one called paralucent. I was wondering how you think it works for
    this name. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s one of the few that I found where the 3 is strong
    and on the same baseline as the rest of the glyphs. <BR> <BR>The sample I posted
    up there are just screenshots so they&#39;re kinda messy... but If I were to go
    with this font I would obviously purchase it. <BR> <BR>- Jesse

  body: Forgot to mention as well... thanks for all the advice so far. I tried flipping
    the E to be a 3 but it just wasn&#39;t working for me.  <BR> <BR>The main thing
    I hear about my design is that it&#39;s &#34;clean&#34;. I want my logo to express
    this as well as have something that is going to last and not be too trendy. I
    think my first post is a bit on the trendy side. This last font is a bit more
    timeless. Thoughts?

    the 3 does look contemporary. To me that&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t know how
    traditional you want to look.  <BR> <BR>One way to go more traditional is with
    small caps and a colon between the numberals and letters. Goudy Old Style, with
    its diamond shaped dots, would also give the hint that it is Biblical reference.  '

    reminds me of helvetica neue that everyone is using these days... but it&#39;s

    thing italic with Paralucent&#39;s &#39;completeold&#39; option on their typesetter.
    You might check it out; I thought it worked quite nicely.  <BR> <BR>I agree that
    contemporary usually works better on the web. Maybe it&#39;s because the low-res
    needs bolder types, with fewer small details...

  body: This has some potential. As far as an icon goes, I think if you went this
    route &#40;as shown in your latest posting&#41; the the prominence of the 1/T
    makes that a no brainer icon. I think you would either have to use or lose this
    element. Regardless, I would love to see it explored. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

    the type face Jesse chose the e&#39;s adn the g are interesting.
