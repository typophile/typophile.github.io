  body: "I have never seen the Japanese yen symbol written with just one bar. But
    I happen to know that the Latinized symbol for the Chinese renminbi, which is
    theoretically identical to the Japanese yen symbol (it shares the same Unicode
    code point), is more frequently written as a Y with a single crossbar. So you
    want to watch the context.\r\n\r\nA similar letter apparently appears in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D2%B0\">Kazakh
    Cyrillic</a>.\r\n\r\nAs for the Euro symbol, I doubt it would be recognizable
    with just one bar--it would look too much like the Ukrainian Ye to me in any event."

  body: I've seen plenty of fonts with a single-bar yen. I don't know the formal rule
    however. I'm doing a font right now with one. The euro is certainly a little odd
    with only one however, and I'm sure I've seen certain rules issued in the early
    days of its existence with regards to the angular chops off the end -- though
    this of course is open to experiment and evolution like any other character. A
    double bar yen would therefore seem to fit visually with this and the rest of
    the currency (double bar $ anyone?)

  body: "I used to double bar the $ in handwriting all the time! Probably influenced
    by the Korean and Japanese practice of using a Chinese character that looks like
    a flipped double-bar $ as the dollar sign...\r\n\r\nAnd to clarify, I certainly
    have seen single-bar Ys, but I don't remember ever seeing one that was meant to
    be the symbol for the Japanese Yen as opposed to the Chinese Renminbi."

    back to the cradle of European civilisation and the first letter of Europe, crossed
    by two parallel lines to indicate the stability of the euro.\u201D But according
    to Mr Eisenmenger, the symbol was drawn \u201Cwithout much consideration\u201D
    for some temporary purpose, and was not at all intended as a currency symbol.\r\n\r\nQuote
    from Hrant's link, the eye is dotted and the euro crossed (twice).\r\nTim"
