  look.\r\nI am a web designer and this time I found a font that I like, but it has
  not free license for using it on the web as Font Face.\r\n\r\nI think that it is
  a Knockout, here there is an example on how it looks the style that I am looking\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/littlemad/5078463972/\r\n\r\nand
  I would love to have an alternative similar of the font, with free license to use
  on the web. Anyone has an idea, what you suggest?\r\n\r\nI have to do some css animations,
  and I need that it is a font and not a graphic so I can convert it in SVG and be
  sure that looks good in every screen.\r\n\r\nThx in advance for all your effort
  :)\r\n\r\np.s. do not think even for a second over Impact, ehehhe :D"

    the fonts listed there usually come with a font face kit."

    to check fontsquirrel and movabletype, I cannot still recognise the subtle difference
    between same style of fonts. I'll test it out :)"
