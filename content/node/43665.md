body: "In 2005, two months before Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, my
  husband and I moved to the New Orleans area. We were extraordinarily lucky; our
  house, studio and their contents survived for the most part intact. \r\n\r\nI heard
  about a specialty printer in New Orleans who had been flooded by the storms, he
  was forced to close.  The plant took five feet of water but a collection of hand
  engraved dies remained dry.\r\n\r\nEvents have always moved slowly here, after the
  storms progress seemed to almost stop.  It was not until November 2006 that I was
  able to recover the half-inch thick steel dies, some of which are over a hundred
  years old.  The beautiful (or crude) hand engraved monogram dies, the quirky club
  and company seals, will become part of the Special Collections Division, Hill Memorial
  Library, Louisiana State University.\r\n\r\nSince 1977 when I first became engaged
  in commercial engraving I have watched the rich polish of polite society decline
  to a harsh commercial glare. To me, each idiosyncratic letter, each imperfectly
  cut line on those preciously wrapped, odd, sugar-cube sized blocks scream of a special
  language, a specific time and a now familiar place called New Orleans.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.abingdon12.com/]]"
