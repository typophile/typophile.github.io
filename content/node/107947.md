  body: "Here are three fonts that are somewhat similar, with colors adjusted to match
    the logo. Note that the periods in the logo are closely kerned while the periods
    in the samples push the letters apart.\r\nFuturaCondMedium:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SFPDAsFuturaCondMedium_3635.jpg]\r\nWeight
    -- close. Letter width -- close.\r\nWaistline for P too high.\r\nWaistline for
    F -- close.\r\nNeutrafaceCondBold:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SFPDAsNeutrafaceCondBold_6522.jpg]\r\nWeight
    -- close. Letter width -- wider.\r\nWaistline for P -- close.\r\nWaistline for
    F -- too low.\r\nGothamXNarrowMedium:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SFPDAsGothamXNarrowMedium_3685.jpg]\r\nWeight
    -- close. Letter width -- wider.\r\nWaistline for P -- close.\r\nWaistline for
    F -- close.\r\nSquare periods instead of round.\r\nI trust that there are also
    other candidates that match one or more features of the logo.\r\nDon"

  body: "Good find Ryuk.\r\nThe letter widths in Relay Condensed are too wide but
    the ones in Relay Compressed are very close. here is a comparison showing, in
    order, top to bottom, Relay Compressed Bold, Relay Compressed Medium, and the
    SFPD Logo.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RallyCompBoldMediumSFPDlogo_4370.jpg]\r\nThe
    SFPD Logo stroke weight is a little heavier than  Relay Compressed Medium. The
    letter shapes are quite close. The main difference is the diagonal stroke on the
    S is slightly more rounded on the logo than in Relay Compressed Medium. The letter
    width of F is narrower in the Logo. The Logo periods are much smaller.\r\nBut
    most people would notice these differences and Relay Compressed Medium is a reasonable
    substitute.\r\nDon\r\n"
