  noticed with some letters I'm working on.\r\nWhen I type out a group of my letters
  they seem to look much better and stronger when I view them as white text on a black
  background instead of black text on a white background.\r\nIs there a reason for
  this? Does it mean I need to make my letters slightly bolder (because white letters
  on black generally appear heavier than when viewed as black on white).\r\nJust wondering
  if anyone had some general insights.\r\nThank you."

    is a \u201Cwhite on black\u201D font that is lighter in absolute weight than the
    \u201Cblack on white\u201D font."

  body: "In printed materials, type that is \"reversed out\" (white type on black)
    tends to close up and look thinner, especially in small sizes, so using a slightly
    bolder weight might be a good idea. \r\n\r\nReversed type is okay for headlines
    or short sections of text, but I wouldn't want to read long passages that way."

  body: Letters on screen are normally backlit, as opposed to printed letters. In
    some environments white on black will come out darker than black on white.

  body: "Viewed on a computer monitor is indeed different. \r\n\r\nIn conventional
    printing on paper, you'd normally create white type by printing a solid area of
    black ink that's knocked out where the letters appear, but as the ink is absorbed
    into the paper (especially on uncoated paper stock) the ink can spread a little
    into the white spaces making the type look thinner. On a monitor you don't have
    that problem."

    signage is done with the lighter fonts Nick Shinn mentioned upstream.'

    body: "Web/film people have all sorts of nicknames for it. I like 'glowtype' myself.\r\n\r\nOn
      screen white type is produced using all available colours, black is produced
      by switching all colours off... So much like you see a glow when you look directly
      at a light bulb or the sun (I don't advise this) relative to a dark background...
      Your white type will produce a slight barely noticeable halo of light making
      it glow - giving the appearance of bolder stronger text or a larger more punchy
      image.\r\n\r\nThe effect is completely reversed on printed material (as mentioned
      above) where the darker ink will bleed into the lighter ink or white area. For
      fine text it literally only has to be a tenth of a mm before it becomes noticeable
      to the naked eye. It can be made worse by auto trapping used in prepress software.
      A good prepress operator should warn you if you're going to have this issue
      and recommend ways around it... \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Another technique for printing white type is to use foil stamping with a
    white foil. I've seen it used on brochure covers and business cards, and a cool
    thing is you can use black paper stock, so even the paper's edge is black. The
    business card below (not mine) uses 2 colors of foil \u2014 black and silver (but
    it could as easily been white).\r\n\r\nBut the technique is expensive and not
    used too often.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card_6053.jpg]"
