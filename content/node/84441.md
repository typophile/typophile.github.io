  fashion/travel/food magazine and want an interesting display type to use for headlines
  (Fresco not quite hitting the mark for me). Can anyone suggest anything that would
  make a good pairing?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    for headlines although do love the thin dot!

  body: "I second the idea of a humanist sans, eg Shinntype's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sensibility/\">Sensibility</a>\r\n\r\nI
    would recommend searching \"humanist sans\" at Fontshop.com, which tends to offer
    classy suggestions with its \"handpicked\" keyword lists, and the foundry-defined
    MyFonts, where you will get more serendipity amongst many faces that aren't humanist
    at all."
