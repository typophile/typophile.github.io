  font from the heading below:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.somnisllibertaris.com/libro/EL_AMIGO_DEL_PUEBLO/el_amigo_del_pueblo_4/el_amigo_del_pueblo_4_01.htm\r\n\r\n\r\nEqually,
  the one below is of interest\r\n\r\nhttp://sagunto.cnt.es/2011/09/11/el-amigo-del-pueblo/\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth
  are from the late 1930's and are newspapers printed in Spain to support the anarchist
  element of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI hope this all makes sense? Please excuse any
  lack of great detail other than these two links\r\n\r\nWith thanks\r\n\r\nPhil"

    based on the same.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the bulk of the nameplate, you could use
    Dharma Gothic or Kommissar Medium (closer for the |G|):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic/\r\nhttp://vllg.com/schwartzco/kommissar\r\n\r\nSwap
    out the |A| and |M| from Washington Bold (and condense them), and you come pretty
    close:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeassociates/washington/\r\n\r\nThe aptly
    named Revolution Gothic approximates the look of the subhead, save for the |A|
    and the |S|:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/revolution-gothic/\r\n\r\nAmerican
    Captain would also work for the subhead, save for the |S|:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontry/american-captain/\r\n\r\nSteal
    a similar |S| from Chi Town:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/chi-town-nf/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "EDITED I suspect that this newspaper letterhead is lettering rather than
    an extract from a specific font.\r\nFonts of the era with similarity to some of
    the features are Willard T. Sniffin's Newprort with its sharp tiped _M_ and _A_
    and lazy _S_. Digitized as Newport Land URW https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/newport-land/
    and Newport Classic SG https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/newport-classic-sg/
    \r\nFar from a perfect match to other features, but I think Los Alamos https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/los-alamos/
    and Raleigh Gothic https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/raleigh-gothic-rr/
    and https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/raleigh-gothic/ sort of harmonize
    with the lettering.\r\nDon "

    of some letters, I find the general proportions of height to width, stroke weight,
    sharp cornered counters and radius of the curve at external corners, puts Komu
