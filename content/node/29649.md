  sustainable surfboard company a few years ago...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OGfrontLogo_5459.gif]\r\n\r\nNow
  they are getting ready to go global and a makeover seemed in order.\r\n\r\nThey
  produce a range of hand crafted hollow balsa and natural fibre surfboards that compete
  in both performance and price with the usual polychemical factory boards.\r\n\r\nKey
  words for the brand image include...\r\n\r\nEnvironmental\r\nQuality / Craftsmanship\r\nHigh
  Performance\r\nClassic / Timeless\r\nSlightly Retro\r\nStylish / Cool\r\n\r\nSo
  is this new version better than the old...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OGLogoV2Proof01a_5364.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
  a simulated decal on a balsa and hemp board...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OGLogoV2Proof01b_4632.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs
  the design any good at all? Any feedback would be great. I feel a real responsibility
  for this one.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The original face seems a bit trendy, but the current one seems, perhaps,
    generic. I like the wave and taking it down to one looks very strong, nice, and
    pretty cool, one gets to enjoy the details more in the singular form. Keeping
    it in the center creates a nicer timing to read the name, as well. However, the
    letters don't seem oceanic but do seem \"green\", As for your keywords, I am only
    feeling the \"Classic\" and the \"Environmental\".\r\n\r\nCan't wait to see where
    this thread goes. Product sounds awesome. http://www.oceangreen.org/\r\n\r\n<A

  body: "I agree - the mark and the type do not match. I do prefer the new treatment
    with the mark in the centre though.\r\n\r\nWhat about going even more \"retro\"
    with the type - not quite Cooper Black, but in that direction. I can see something
    fat and just a little swashy working.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "The wave is far stronger in your newer incarnation. Removing the earlier
    drop shadow accentuates the form. Using it once rather than twice also makes it
    more dynamic and captures the power of a surfable wave. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    the type looks uptight and disconnected from the forward surge of the wave. The
    type lacks any sense of attitude, so keep investigating possibilities - I agree
    with Lex that it's worth considering something round or chunky a la Cooper Black.
    It could provide nice contrast for the angularity of the mark. The mark itself
    is exciting. "

  body: "OK, ok, not saying this is better, but I was just playing around with ideas.
    The font is Acorn Swash, from Ingrimayne Type / Robert Schenk. If I really were
    going to work in it, I would tweak it by replacing the swashes with something
    even more reminiscent of your circular wave.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OGLogoV2Acorn_6032.gif]"

  body: "Not sure if that one looks good in an all-caps setting.\r\n\r\nI would recommend
    something like Saracen from H&FJ. It's too bad that it's the only one of the Proteus
    Project types without an Italic, since I think you definitely need a slant to
    the type to match the mark.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Thanks guys for the feedback so far, and especially your enthusiasm Choz.\r\n\r\nDon't
    look at their website just yet. It's horrid and since that site was done the boards
    have improved 1000%. I'm in the process of giving the site a facelift too.\r\n\r\nThe
    original logo type was hand lettering. That was back when i thought that kind
    of style was cool. The 2 waves in the first design were trying to suggest an O
    and G.\r\n\r\nI considered Cooper Black for the new version (what with the old
    Beach Boys Pet Sounds connection) but i think that typeface is still too retro
    despite it's recent trendy resurgence. And i didn't think it's flabby rounded
    serifs complimented the waves tapered strokes.\r\n\r\nA classic / timeless vibe
    is more important than a retro one. But it also needs to appeal to a youth dominant
    market as well as the more mature surfer if possible.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the
    choice of font on the new version was to have an O which was perfectly circular
    (before slanting) both inside and out, so that it balanced with the negative circular
    space at the center of the wave. Therefore a typeface with a mono stroke width
    was needed.\r\n\r\nTodd, thanks for your visual, but i felt any swirliness in
    the font may detract from the impact of the wave.\r\n\r\nLex, i like your Saracen
    suggestion. It could inspire a hand lettering job with slightly more subtle and
    contemporary serifs, maybe a mono stroke width and definately italic.\r\n\r\nAnd
    thanks Bill, for your comment \"The mark itself is exciting\". That's the kind
    of reassurance i needed :)\r\n\r\nBelow is a pic of a leaflet i did for Ocean
    Green a little while ago which has a more up to date image of one of their boards
    than what's on the current website. The grungy style was to appeal to a particular
    surf comp/festival youth audience, but it's been decided to go with a slicker
    look since then.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OceanGreenEcoFoilThruster01_5018.jpg]\r\n"
