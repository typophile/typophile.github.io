body: Hi all... I&#39;m new here.  This is a logo we did for a new chocolate line
  being introduced.  This was our third design, which the client loved immediately.  This
  is basically what will be hitting the shelves.  Opinions anyone?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63848.gif"

  body: 'This looks really fun, but it would be nice to see some kind of variation
    in the &#34;e&#34;. The &#34;e&#34; appears five times and they are all identical.
    The letters are so organic, it would make sense to mix it up a little. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Good point on the &#39;e&#39;s.  I don&#39;t
    care for using stock letterforms on custom logos &#40;particularly because it
    encourages theft&#41; but we had to whip this design up in less than a week, so,
    unfortunately, we sacrificed creativity to alacrity here.  But, that&#39;s a great
    observation.  Thanks. <BR> <BR>Bill B

  body: sweet! ;-D <BR>  <BR>but i would ditch the dolphins type. it &#40;to mee,
    i see it everywhere nowadays&#41; just seems overused, or maybe it is a good thing
    . . . <BR>it just seems too characteristic, and thus it makes the design more
    the oposite of it. <BR>  <BR>so i would suggest maybe another &#39;curvy&#39;
    type?

  body: William I wouldn&#39;t change anything but I would do testing to make sure
    it worked on a variety of sizes. Does it work tiny? If not you might need a variation
    that is simplier. I&#39;d also research the name. Another big nasty corporate
    giant might have a TM on Sweet Revenge. Just some thoughts

  body: 'Dragan is right, that &#34;dolphins&#34; type is used a lot, but I think
    in this case, it&#39;s just too darn perfect for the application to lose it in
    lieu of popular overuse. <BR> <BR>In regard to the &#34;e&#34;: I feel for you
    on the quick turnaround, but I think even a tweak as subtle as slight rotation
    might help a little, or even chopping just a little bit off the curly end of a
    couple of the &#34;e&#39;s&#34;; otherwise, I love it! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still
    craving chocolate. My wife is pregnant, and chocolate is one of my cravings. <BR>

  body: not creazy about the typeface either. with thousands of curly type out there,
    you should be able to find some unique with very little effort.

  body: William the first option has a very playful type, but the name is too long.
    I think the second option would do a better job with the name and on the shelves.
    What would happen if you copped of the &#34;for you&#34; appendix.

    Sheryl&#39;s a logo mark, TM or '

  body: 'I&#39;d ditch the &#34;Austin Powers&#34; type &#40;way overused&#41; and
    go for something more contemporary and exclusive, like Sauna or Bello from Underware:

  body: Bert, <BR> <BR>Gotta disagree with you there.  Those fonts you suggested look
    like they belong on the front of a kids little league shirt &#40;haha&#41; <BR>
    <BR>They don&#39;t convey any &#34;edginess&#34; and there is little potential
    for intertwining them, or adding the little devil tail.  These were specific requirements
    from the client, which we had to keep in mind when selecting a font. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t see any problem with using common typefaces in logo design, as long
    as they are personalized to the job at hand.  Many well known logos use popular
    typefaces which are just modified.  Look at the letters in logos like Pepsi, Jurassic
    Park, The Crocodlie Hunter, Honda, or Playboy magazine, just to name a few.   <BR>
    <BR>From a psychological marketing viewpoint, I think there are advantages to
    using familiar letterforms, particularly in logo design, as the public sees something
    different, yet familiar.  Going for the obscure or radical isn&#39;t always best.

  body: William, just as you disagree with Bert so I must disagree with you. Any of
    Underware&#39;s type could be a perfect combination for a chocolate package especially
    Sauna, Bello and Auto. Their type is well crafted and could help, IMO, create
    a sense of well-made chocolate.

  body: Tiffany, <BR> <BR>There are hundreds of typefaces that could convey a sense
    of well-made chocolate, but this client specifically asked for something &#34;edgy&#34;,
    that brought together, mischeiviously, the concepts of good &amp; evil. <BR> <BR>I
    like bouncing ideas around.  This was a quick throw together, and really doesn&#39;t
    do your suggestion justice, but wouldn&#39;t you agree the general feel, on first
    glance, is not &#34;edgy&#34;? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64163.gif"
    alt="Comparison"> <BR> <BR>That was an important design criteria. <BR> <BR>While
    well crafted, I don&#39;t find any of Underware&#39;s type to be edgy, so I wouldn&#39;t
    consider it a good choice for this job.

  body: The two you&#39;ve just posted? I don&#39;t find them to be edgy. I suppose
    edgy is the eye of the beholder. Are you thinking you need to go more along the
    lines of what <a href="http://www.margochase.com/" target="_blank">Margo Chase</a>
    did for the Kama Sutra line? Or any of her work for that matter.  <BR> <BR>I think
    you could imply &#34;naughty and nice&#34; without actually having to show a devil&#39;s
    tail and an angel&#39;s halo.

  body: Tiffany, <BR> <BR>Margo Chase&#39;s clients have budgets in the thousands
    &#40;if not tens of thousands&#41; of dollars.  My guess is, they can afford whatever
    they want. <BR> <BR>In this case, we weren&#39;t hired to create a marketing campaign,
    or educate our client about the impact of a logo design on sales.  They had a
    trade show.  We had a week to work, and a few hundred dollars to spend.  That
    precluded going through numerous incarnations. <BR> <BR>There are many directions
    you can go in when creating a design.  In this case, we showed our client three
    ideas.  The halo/devil tail turned out to be their favorite.  It was an easy solution,
    given the limited budget.  I was happy, they were happy.  I hate defering artistic
    spirit to job constraints, but the reality is, it happens more then it doesn&#39;t.  Will
    it win a Clio?  No.  Did it solve their problem?  Yes.  Such is the world of production
    artwork. <BR> <BR>I sincerely appreciate your feedback though.  Thanks.
