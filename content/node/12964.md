  is a good idea. I surprised that it hasn't been mentioned here you. FontShop Berlin
  has built a little blog, similar perhaps to [[Erik Spiekermann]]'s blog, but with
  more recent content. The Blog is in German, but one entry in particular may be discernable/interesting
  no non-German readers: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.de/newsfeed/C130586115/E2039220131/index.html\">The
  Visitor Survey Results from TYPO Berlin 2005</a>.\r\n\r\nThe top entry at the moment,
  <ahref=\"http://www.fontshop.de/newsfeed/C1477026505/E1840816719/index.html\">that
  FSI has liberalized their EULA</a> on some fronts is also very interesting, although
  I suspect that more info about that must be elsewhere on Typophile, or soon will
  be."

    there are lots of plus and minus points that must have been pulled out of questionnaires.
