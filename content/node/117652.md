  body: "As I said in my previous post the original name is unknown but the Solo version
    was Titania. I discussed who might have done original digitizations and who were
    the copycats. The problem is that the likely original digital fonts are very difficult
    to obtain legitimately. For commercial use I recommend the Solofont digital version
    included in Dover/Solofont Art Nouveau book + CD pack. The Steffmann version is
    a pirated copy.\r\nDon"
