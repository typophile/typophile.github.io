body: Hi, this is my first time posting here. I&#39;m looking for a bit of Gills Sans
  expertise. <BR> <BR>I was recently hired by a company whose logo used fake Gill
  Sans caps &#40;&amp; ITC Garamond Italic with a 1pt stroke to make it bold, but
  that&#39;s another issue&#41;. The first thing I did was to redraw their logo with
  some proper small caps. Then last night I discovered that AgfaMonotype sells a Gill
  Sans Small Caps font. This leads me to 3 questions <BR> <BR>1. Whose version &#40;of
  the standard weights&#41; of Gill Sans is better, Linotype or Monotype? Or are they
  the same? <BR> <BR>2. Is Monotype&#39;s Gill Sans Small Caps any good? <BR> <BR>3.
  Whose version of Gill Sans comes with OSX?

    target="_blank">here</a>. <BR> <BR>3. I assume it&#39;s Linotype since most of
    the bundled fonts are.

  body: Thanks for the info, guys. <BR> <BR>Does anyone who has used Gill Sans Small
    Caps have an opinion about them? <BR> <BR>Also, are the small caps part of Gill&#39;s
    original designs or are they one of the many later add ons?

  body: I have worked with the Monotype version which includes the SC and they are
    just fine. I always liked the GillSans Uppercase forms much better than the lowercase
    and have found that they work almost absurdly well in a job that combines Trajan
    and the Gill SC, which sounds weird at first, but matching these two somewhat
    overused fonts turned out right somehow. It&#39;s not perfect and I think there
    are more modern designs and fonts &#40;in the technical sense&#41; out there,
    that are more fun to work with, but it sure as heck is better than using fake
    SC.
