  body: You have spacing problems with the word Severe. Start by looking at the first
    group of letters as a unit. Look at the SEV relationship, the gap between the
    E and V makes the S look too tight, the balance is off. Same can be said with
    the VER combination. The last E is just floating by its lonesome self. After adjusting
    the VER combination, see what you need to do with the last E. <BR>One last thought
    drop the V down so the top is even with the E&#39;s and let the bottom of the
    V separate Extreme Eating from Do you dare to indulge?

  body: How about giving up the descending serifs on the E&#39;s &#40;the part that
    goes below the baseline&#41;. I find it overpowering and disturbing.
