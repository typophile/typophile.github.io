  \"Medici\" looking like this... Can you tell me where I can buy it or is it really
  a different font?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: The only "Medici" I can find is Zapf's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=LH.108060.0.1">Medici
    Script</a>, but your sample sure looks like Hermie. Perhaps it's something he
    did which hasn't been digitized.

  body: Linotype will soon release Palatino Nova along with titling complements Michelangelo
    and Sistina. I don't have samples handy, but I think one of these might be close.

  body: Ah, yes. I forgot about the Berthold version. But Misa, I highly recommend
    you wait for the Linotype version if you can. It comes straight from the designer
    and the designer will be duly compensated.

  body: "Yes, Stephen is on to something. Can you wait a few more weeks?\r\n\r\nThe
    Michelangelo font in the Palatino nova family will be called \"Palatino nova Titling.\"
    It is all-caps, just like the original, but each glyph has been newly redrawn.
    It will included Greek capitals as well (revisions of Zapf's old metal Greek titling
    face, Phidias Greek), as well as some alternates, etc.\r\n\r\nSistina, a heavier
    all-caps titling face, will also be inlcuded in the Palatino nova family (it will
    be called Palatino nova Imperial). An older digitization of Sistina is still available
    from Linotype: http://www.linotype.com/56642/sistinaregular-font.html\r\n\r\nAldus
    was revised for Palatino nova as well, but it will still be called Aldus (or \"Aldus
    nova\", actually\u2026)"
