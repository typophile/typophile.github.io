  want to compromise legibility. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about using the typeface
  Lo-Res 9 (Narrow & Small Caps) by Zuzana Licko for setting text on paper?\r\n\r\nOr
  maybe, Fedra Bitmap designed by Peter Bilak (I really like Fedra Big Family!)\r\n\r\nIf
  you remember good examples of a pixel font well set on print, I'd like to see them.\r\n\r\nIt
  would be nice if a type designer would design a pixel font to work good on paper.
  \ \r\n\r\nAbout setting the text: problably I'll need to give a little more space
  between the lines, anything else?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    narrow cuts, for reasons of readability.\r\nIf economy is an issue (and when isn't

    think FontFont has a number of good print-savvy bitmap fonts.\r\n\r\nBut a question:
    you say 10pt, but that doesn't mean you're limited\r\nto 10 pixels of height.
    How fine/coarse do you want the text to look?\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is interesting
    - please show us your progress!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, for one thing text setting is about subtlety. A feature of the font
    doesn't have to be \"emphasized\" (in fact some would say it <cite>shouldn't</cite>
    be emphasized) for the text to work.\r\n\r\nWill some people think \"it's a mistake\"?
    Yes, but Maria has to factor in what percentage of her readers that will be -
    and chances are it's very small.* If it's done right, I think most people will
    either not notice consciously or they'll think something along the lines of \"Hey,
    this printing is artsy\". :-)  And some graphic designers are likely to actualy
    like it consciously. Also, the fact that some people will think \"it's a mistake\"
    could be a conversation piece, especially if/when they end up finding out that
    it wasn't! For example maybe by reading a carefully-composed colophon.\r\n\r\n*
    And if somebody is savvy enough to think such a thing, he might be savvy enough
    to realize that that couldn't have been what was subbed in for a missing font
    (unless Maria's choice is very generic-looking).\r\n\r\nThat said, I do think
    that the \"resolution\" of the pixelfont has to be chosen very carefully, and
    not least based on the repro quality.\r\n\r\nMaybe we need to see a PDF?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Ah, I guess it was an ant! Haven't looked for it yet though.\r\n\r\nThe difference
    in the \"a\" is one good reason to use the 12. A bigger reason would be a general
    increase in readability, since the bitmaps will have more fidelity to \"expected\"
    letterforms. But, as you imply, a critical element of deciding how coarse the
    bitmap font should be is the balance between \"flavor\" and readability, and that
    will only reveal itself through some good actual testing. It's possible the 12
    will be too subtle at 10pt (although I doubt it).\r\n\r\n> In what ways do you
    think this can have a bad influence on legibility?\r\n\r\nGood question. I guess
    it comes down to deviating from \"ideal\" bitmaps simply to preserve the abstract
    character of the original (a character that does not necessarily promote readability
    of its own). I do think this sort of thing has value within a bitmap font family
    of multiple sizes, but trying to maintain it too much between bitmaps and outlines
    tends to backfire.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    You mean it\u2019s like trying to dissimulate the essence of a bitmap typeface.
    Valuing it\u2019s form instead of it\u2019s actual usability.\r\n\r\nI think my
    eyes are not accurate enough to see that differences, when I look at Fedra Bitmap
    I can\u2019t relate it to the outline of Fedra... but in a theoretical level I
    understand your point and it makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Typotheque
    is working on the open type format of Fedra Bitmap, so it will take a while before
    the font is available for sail again. That\u2019s why I couldn't find it on their
    web site!"

    is width: often you will see a bitmap letter that could have been much nicer if
    it were one pixel wider or narrower, but its width was dictated by a quantization

    a pixelated font such as unibody to a printer? I've already sent pre-press these
    fonts, and they seemed concerned about the resolution? I've told them it's a "on
    purpose pixelated font style," yet they want printable version of unibody? Am
    I going crazy here, or is the pre-press department unfamiliar with this typeface?
    Your speedy reply is much obliged:) (Also another beautiful pixel font I've discovered
    lately is FFF Atlantis, and FFF Corporate)
