  body: "There are several fine faces that are mentioned in Stephen's blog post in
    the alternates and also-rans. But there are, of course, many others not mentioned.
    \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of previous threads here with long, general lists of
    newish book faces. (Florian can probably hunt them down quickly ;-)\r\n\r\nYour
    brief is pretty wide open. If you have some more specific criteria, you'll get
    more specific suggestions.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."
