  | 'Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers']] by Leonard Koren, It's
  a great book and I really feel that it's describing a fifteenth-century form of
  Modernism. Do any of y'all know about Wabi-Sabi?\r\n\r\nI've found that both Wabi-Sabi
  and Modernism are in direct response to the prevalance of ornament. Koren suggests
  that Wabi-Sabi was born for aesthetic reasons while Modernism came from function.
  I think that there is a good possibility that Wabi-Sabi's earthy imperfection is
  a result of constructing objects with the most practical materials in the most practical
  methods of the time (mid 15th century), and the lack of aesthetic consideration
  is a result from the efficiency of production.\r\n\r\nI guess my main question would
  be, would you consider Wabi-Sabi in the same timeline as Modernism??\r\n\r\nhere's
  the Wabi-Sabi [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-Sabi | wiki]]"

    decoration, not perfection, not anything un-essential to the purpose of \"cup\".
    So they went and found the most basic cups they could find, i.e., something made
    by a Korean farmer who just dug up some dirt out back by his barn and made a cup
    that worked as a cup.\r\n\r\nNo intrinsic value other than \"cupness\".\r\n\r\nIf
    you were to compare this idea to any kind of movement, a surprising match, in
    my mind, would be Swiss International style. On the surface, it seems different
    than Wabi-Sabi, but when you boil it down to the absolute essentials you realize
    that both styles are based upon distilling the essence of something down to...
    the absolute essential. "

    served by reading Zen poets.\r\n\r\nThere is a concept called mugo that means
    when you write a poem about something you must first become the thing. That is
    done by meditating on the subject. So Shinkichi Takahashi's tremendous <cite>Triumph
    of the Sparrow</cite> is the result of his meditations on the sparrow, his becoming
    the sparrow. He is a particularly interesting character who was a dadaist in the
    1920s in Japan, got arrested and thrown in jail for it, and then later became
    a Buddhist monk. He is a calligrapher and poet and a designated Japanese cultural
    treasure.\r\n\r\nModernism and Zen were not on the same timeline - Zen appears
    in China in the 5th or 6th century when Bodhidharma brings Buddhism there from
    India. In China it mixes with Tao and thus Zen begins. It flowers during the Tang
    dynasty (which is one of the greatest civilizations ever - for example, to serve
    in the government you had to be an artist) and we get Li Po, Tu Fu, and Wang Wei
    who established the art of poetry as a Zen activity. It is not until the 14th
    century or so that it is transmitted to Japan, which is what most people think
    of when they think of Zen.\r\n\r\nThe best translator of Zen poetry into English
    is Lucien Stryk. Probably because he is also a poet and an academician at the
    University of Illinois the last time I checked.\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\nMy mind is subject
    to change without notice."

    to design you could look at something in a naive or folk direction that is functional
    and charming because it specifically looks as if a designer never touched it."

  body: "I had a college sensei who was a pottery master who specialized in tea ceremony
    utensils. I once asked him how many cups, bowls, etc., he had. He said two. Two
    cups. Two bowls. Two everything. The rest were for sale, so that he could put
    rice into his two bowls.\r\n\r\nThe point is that having more, more perfection,
    \ more quantity, more new, doesn't mean better bowl or cup. It just means more.\r\n\r\nMy
    sensei would throw away many many bowls because he put too much of himself, his
    ego, into the bowl. He put too much emphasis on the perfection. Too much into
    the style. Too much that wasn't the essence of \u201Cbowl\u201D. But then he would
    find one where he wasn't focused on perfection, but focused on bowl. And he would
    keep that one.\r\n\r\nThe clays and the firing processes certainly contain the
    essence of the \"bowl\" of which they created and are a part of, the same as the
    creator is part of the essence of the \"bowl\". But they do not make up the entirety
    of the bowl. It's not a bowl unless it can be used in a bowl-like fashion.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a deep meditation process on any creative undertaking, that's for certain. That's
    one difference between old art and modern art, if you ask me.\r\n\r\n"

    wrong place.\r\n\r\nWabi-Sabi is directly derived from Zen so I see no need to
    study it (I have the book). Go to the source. Study ikebana, shodo, etc. Ikebana
    is a particularly good pursuit for designers. Lines.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy is the

  body: "Modernism* and Zen aesthetics do have some things in common - an interest
    in reduction of ornament, advocating simplicity and so on. Also Wabi & Sabi are
    not the same. It can be hard to get the difference but there is one. But Wabi
    Sabi is very very different from and 20th century modernism. For one thing Wabi
    & Sabi are both aesthetics that have to do with the natural. Modernism is about
    the man made or synthetic. Wabi & Sabi are not about bright colors. Modernism
    all about bright color per see isn't either per se but it is hard to think about
    Modernism as existing meaningfully outside of the use of red. Modernism is about
    the new. Wabi & Sabi are about the beauty of the weathered and the used. Modernism
    is showy - Wabi and Sabi are the opposite. You could go on and on.\r\n\r\nSo in
    a word : no. I think only a very superficial reading of either wabi, sabi, or
    modernism can relate them closely let alone any question of timeline.\r\n\r\n*
    when you say modernism it is a very vague thing to say - If you say futurism,
    dada, bauhaus, and leaving too many things out and ending with mid century modernism...
    it would be less vague.\r\n\r\nI probably feel overly strongly about this because
    i did an undergrad thesis on Wabi Sabi & Shibui and the ways in which they are
    used to sell things in advertising in Japan."
