  body: It's not Gill, not with that /R/, /P/ and /A/. Will keep looking.

  body: At a closer look I'm thinking it's custom or hand-made. Look at the differences
    in colour between the heavy /A/ and the light /O/, the strange spacing, The slightly
    uneven /M/, The strange discrepancy of the bowls of the /R/ contra the /P/, and
    also maybe a slight difference between the two /R/'s... I don't think a professional
    typeface would behave that way.
