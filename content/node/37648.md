  Horley Old Style. As you might know, this face was developped in 1922 from Monotype
  as an answer to Goudy\u2019s successful Kennerley. I guess later (1977?) Robert
  Norton worked on a revival and today Horley is available as a digitised typeface
  as well.\r\n\r\nIf anybody of you have special background or any information about
  Horley, the specific designers behind it, Robert Norton or if anybody has access
  to specimens from the diffrent typefaces (1925, 1977, today....) or if anybody knows
  where such specimens could be watched... Every little hint or information is very
  helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you very much and have a good time!\r\n\r\ncheerz,\r\nRoland"

  body: Various bits of info through Google appear about the face. Linotype's site
    says that Frank Hinman Pierpont was the designer of Horley; another site says
    he supervised the design of it.
