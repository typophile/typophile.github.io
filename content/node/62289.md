  body: OK, just had a look at Fette Fraktur ... accepting that I am fairly ignorant
    in things typographic but I am amazed that that ampersand belongs to a blackletter
    font. I was imagining a gorgeous font with a heavy italic family member that had
    lovely thick and thin contrasts. Don't suppose you get what I'm thinking of and
    know of one that may fit? I probably should take this query to the design forum!

  body: "Frankly, me too. But WTF told me otherwise. (That was the whole trick.)\r\nThen
    again I wasn\u2019t all that surprised because the construction of the ampersand
    is kinda strange. And isn\u2019t Fette Fraktur the Poster Bodoni of the blackletters?"

  body: "Yes I was looking for something like those ones you mentioned, altaira. Although
    they are still not quite right ... I guess I'm looking for that style but much
    more understated and elegant. I'm not sure one exists ... If only my meagre publishing
    company had the budget to commission a new one!\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help,
    guys/girls."

  body: "Nina suggested Scotch Modern Bold Italic which is awesome not only because
    the letters as drawings are beautiful but it also has Titling umlauts, real small
    caps and Swash Alternates for almost every single Uppercase letter including \xC6
    and \u0152.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P1130126_6451.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P1130127_4160.JPG]\r\nOops
    sorry about the huge images"

  body: Yes I see ... I don't like the serifs on the caps but the swash alternates
    are lovely, and the bold italic font is really beautiful. I am going to give it
    a test drive! Thanks for the nudge!

  body: "Interesting. When you say \"groovier\" do you also mean more contemporary?
    Because Scotch Modern does have quite a \"historical\" feel I think. More\u2026
    slick, polished, smooth, current? I'm wondering what there is in that niche.\r\n(Johnny,
    thanks for the scan! I was too lazy.)"
