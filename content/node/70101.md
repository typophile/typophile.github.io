body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n I'm new to the website and I've found all the information
  here very helpful. For my senior project I chose to design a typeface from scratch,
  and there are some technical issues that I am having. I am making an italic serif
  typeface in the old style/ transitional style. I've taken some inspiration from
  Giambattista Bodoni's Bodoni typeface, and it will be used for displays, pull quotes,
  and headers. \r\n\r\nJust like Bodoni's italic font in the lowercase the serif curves
  (e.g. lowercase 'h') up to the right and the width of this serif determines the
  width of the thin areas in the rest of the family. My questions is; In illustrator
  I'm having difficulty making sure the widths of the thin areas are consistent? because
  of the angle and different shapes of the bowls, cross bars, and descenders are all
  so different.   \r\n\r\nI apologize in advance if this isn't the right section to
  be posting this topic, but any help would be much appreciated since I am new to
  this process. \r\n\r\nthank you "

  body: "I'm not sure how that is relevant? At the moment the typeface is filled with
    no stroke and I can see some discrepancies in some areas and want to be a bit
    more accurate at the widths. note; I haven't made an OTF yet and it is sitting
    at the stage just before importing into fontlab. I wanted to cleanup to make fontlab
    a little easier on myself.\r\n\r\n I just wanted to know if there is any techniques
    to stay consistent in the strokes widths when they are always switching between
    thick and thin? "

  body: A path with a <strong>normal stroke</strong>, when converted to an outline,
    will have a uniform width. A path with a <strong>calligraphic stroke</strong>,
    when converted to an outline, will have a width consistent with the dimensions
    of the calligraphy tool chosen. Such outlines can replace elements in the glyph
    designs, or you can put them on a lower layer and adjust your glyph outlines to
    match the results.

    chosen diameter, which can then be moved around to check widths. \r\n\r\nThat
    said, mathematically equivalent widths and optically equivalent widths are two
    different things; and really, the only tool to achieve the latter is your eye."

  body: "Thanks eliason, the gauge ball trick is exactly what I was looking for.\r\nOldnick
    I think your one step ahead of where I am and now I know what you are talking
    about.\r\n\r\nthanks a bunch."
