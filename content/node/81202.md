body: I want to manually tweak some of the PS autohinting in my fonts. To avoid manually
  tweaking all of the characters in a family can I convert my hints to links, generate
  my interpolated instances, and then convert all the links back to hints before creating
  the final fonts?

  body: I was wondering about something similar. Disappointed Superpolator doesn't
    interpolate PS hinting, which means I leave hinting until the very end and autohint
    the whole finished family then make manual adjustments across all weights.

    been developed exactly for that purpose. '
