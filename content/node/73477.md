body: "Good evening,\r\ni am doing a little tidying in my typefaces. And there is
  a lot of strange suffixes that is a little cryptic to me. Maybe any of you can clarify,
  or point me in the right direction where I can find some answers.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nLT
  - University LT Roman\r\nCE - Univers CE 55 Medium\r\nBQ - AkzidenzGroteskBQ-Reg\r\nBE
  - Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk BE Regular (This one I just found out, from the BErthold
  libraries right?\r\n\r\nThere are alot of these, that seems cryptic to a mortal
  graphic designer.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing... which hierarchy of sorting the do
  you recommend, without getting to scientific. Is there any software that could sort
  them automatically perhaps?"

    know but, some time back, I came across a web page which listed all the known--at
    that time--suffixes and the foundries to which they belonged. It sounds like something
    Luc Devoyre might have compiled..."
