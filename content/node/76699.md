  bug that a lot of you seem to have (noticing everything about every font everywhere!),
  and as such have been looking a lot into getting into designing a typeface myself.\r\n\r\nI
  know there are lots of FAQ sections and How To's, and I've read all those, but there's
  one point in particular I'd like to hear people's thoughts on... \"purpose\".\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to clear to me that every new typeface has to have a purpose, a reason to
  be created, or has to be meeting a need. \"It looks nice\" isn't really enough of
  an argument, and also seems to lean too far to the 'art' side of the art/design
  balance. \r\n\r\nHow do you go about choosing a purpose? For experimental projects
  is it worth choosing a restriction (e.g. geometrical etc.) or a broad purpose (e.g.
  children's books etc.)? Not even just for a 'beginner' like me, but in general,
  it would be nice to know what people identify as the 'purpose' for a new typeface
  at this crucial stage early in a new design.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "I tend to have very different reasons for making a typeface: intersting form
    I've found, and then trying to incorporate that into a font; an existing typeface
    that I like, but which has some forms that irk me (I made Kaapeli for this reason);
    mechanical or technical features, like ink trapping. For this I made two families:
    Tang with huge, exaggerated ink traps, and Tar with round corners, and so controlling
    the trapping.\r\n\r\nAnd also just because it's fun."

  body: "Adam, if you are new to type design, and have caught the \"obsession\", may
    I suggest you start by trying to recreate something you like by not looking at
    it. Put a type design you admire in your mind. Look at it, study it, contemplate
    it, and then go about recreating it without going back for reference. You'll create
    something new and have fun at the same time. And how interesting would it be to
    compare your \"inspired\" design with the original.\r\n\r\nYou will then be doing
    what most type designers are doing, using your \"sense memory\" of a typographic
    form to direct a new design."

    that 'it looks nice' is actually a valid end goal as well!\r\n\r\n@jmontalbano
    - could you explain a little more on what you mean by \"your 'sense memory' of
    a typographic form\"?\r\n\r\nI think I may give your suggestion a go.\r\n\r\nI
    was also contemplating giving some of the past 'type battles' a shot, just to
    get a feel for designing for such a variety of challenges!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: 'Strictly speaking, Sense Memory is a phenomenon associated with Constantin
    Stanislavski''s teachings, normally referred to as "Method Acting." The basic
    premise is that emotions are tied to experiences, and remembering the experience
    will spontaneously produce the emotion. Hence, a Method actor doesn''t need to
    "act" to portray a specific emotion: he or she need only recall a life experience
    during which the emotion was felt, and the feeling will return.'

  body: "We also have somewhere in our total memory and experience a sense of what
    the \"Essence\" of a letterform is. This is not a style or classification issue.
    \ It is more about developing a form which will be reasonably interpreted as a
    particular glyph.  It has \"B-ness\" or which ever form we mean. (I dare not say
    \"A-ness ;-)\r\nThis is not necessarily a skeletal form and may require the rest
    of the glyphs in the set to make its case. If we just take a skeletal form \"B\"
    and clothe it in a suit of serifs, we may see it approaching Roman Letter but
    it may be a poor example. Essence requires enough to elicit the desired response;
    \"Yes, this is a Roman letter B\".  I think of it more in Plato's terms of \"Seeing
    Forms\" than just a Fontstruct kind of thing. \r\nIf, as type designers, we have
    acquired the vision to \"see forms\" in the typographic sense, then we do not
    need to examine existing fonts (although there still is an education in it). This
    may only be my preferred way of working but I find it valuable as a way of arriving
    at the specific by beginning with the general and avoiding using a specific known
    solution without first banging my head on it a while."

  body: "Many of my fonts are commissioned so there's always some kind of purpose
    involved. When I'm not working on commission, I still have a purpose in mind such
    as <em>heavy, compact web headliner</em> or <em>narrow, antihistorical typewriter</em>.
    At the very least, a font is designed with either headlines or text in mind. When
    testing a headliner, I don't need to worry so much how it performs in paragraphs
    at small sizes. When testing a text font, I don't need to worry as much about
    how it will look on a billboard.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to clear to me that every new
    typeface has to have a purpose, a reason to be created, or has to be meeting a
    need.\"\r\n\r\nYou can make up your own hypothetical needs too. I've done that
    quite a bit. <a href=\"http://www.typodermic.com/196.html\">Silicone</a> is a
    font I designed to look good embossed in silicone. Nobody commissioned it for
    that purpose, it was just done on a whim. Having a purpose in mind makes it easier
    for me to make a unified design.\r\n\r\nNot every typeface is made with purpose.
    I made <a href=\"http://www.typodermic.com/225.html\">Voivode</a> with no purpose
    in mind. I opened up Fontlab, started drawing glyphs and let myself go. Voivode
    sold almost zero copies so that might tell you something. Some of my earlier fonts
    (Larabie Fonts) were experiments with no purpose in mind other than releasing
    them."
