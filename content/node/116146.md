  while ago I decided to stop mocking comic sans and instead do something about it.
  I created <em>JollyGood Sans</em> as a replacement that would keep the fun, informal,
  handmade feel of CS, but with a more polished look (seriously, have you taken a
  close look at the capital H in CS?). \r\n\r\nThe result is a family of <em>11 fonts</em>
  (more on the pipeline) that are legible, web-friendly, and have very complete character
  sets, including ligatures and alternate letterforms.\r\n\r\nI hope it gives designers
  an alternative for when a comicsans-ish touch is needed.\r\n\r\nJollyGood Basic
  is free, the rest are 60% off for a limited time.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.jollygoodfonts.com/|JollyGood

    with Comic Sans and correcting the most obvious problems as Comic Neue did.\r\n\r\nYou
    may want to double-check the webfonts; as they appear on your site there are some
    strange artifacts, most notably a mangled \"e\" in Light."
