body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your help on the following situation:\r\n\r\nI
  got this catalog going on, where I need to format a price table. The prices must
  be aligned left, but when there's a bigger price (ex: \u20AC888,00 in relation to
  \u20AC88,00) I need the \"88,00\" to align to the right of the \"888,00\". I've
  made an example to show you what I mean since this can't be explained very well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indesign_6727.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
  thing that would be great is the table auto collapsing to the last algorithm at
  the right.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\nPedro Peixoto"

    a tab there (or better: align it to the comma)."
