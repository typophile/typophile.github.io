  that BVD used for their Stores http://bvd.se/stories/. \r\nI've never heard of this
  typeface before, the only proof i've got of it's existence is from the book \u201EI
  Love Type 01 - Futura\u201F. \r\n"

  body: "I see that the link you've provided references the same BVD client as is
    featured in the photo from the book: G\xF6tgatan Stories, apparently a caf\xE9
    franchise on the order of Starbucks or Second Cup (although apparently it <em>is</em>
    also a store).\r\n\r\nIndeed, Google, even Google Books, comes up dry when asked
    for a typeface named Avisto.\r\n\r\nThe client itself shows up at [[http://www.cafestories.se/gotgatan.html]]
    - and in fact it appears that the client is actually Caf\xE9er Stories, with Kutlturhuset
    Stories, Hamngatan Stories, and others belonging to the same group.\r\n\r\nFrom
    here\r\n\r\n[[http://www.packagingdesignarchive.org/archive/pack_details/1586-gotgatan-stories]]\r\n\r\nsome
    more details become apparent; this was the first location. But it opened in 2007,
    so what was that typeface doing between the 1930s and 2007?\r\n\r\nWhatTheFont
    didn't give any results that resembled it; however, a look through the typefaces
    at MyFonts turned up [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro/|Sofia]]
    from Mostardesign, which does have a slight resemblance."
