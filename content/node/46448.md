  been asked an answered already somewhere.\r\n\r\nI am a big fan of the Futura Light
  typeface and have been using it in letterheads for a few years already. These days
  I want to change my letterheads a bit and I am looking for a Serif font that can
  accompany the lightness and clear statements of Futura. My letters usually don't
  exceed one or maybe two pages so it won't be too much text to read. However, I very
  much dislike letters set in Sans-Serif fonts so this leads me to my request.\r\n\r\nAny
  help (or images of text samples) is (are) greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nClemens"

    a great serif font that somehow reminds me of Futura with its clearness and lightness.

    should give you some ideas though. And do you ever claim that you are a descendant
    of Paul Renner?

    search suggestion, I will check it out later today.\r\n\r\nLirak,\r\nThanks for
    your suggestion but I think Lubalin Graph reminds me a tad too much of fixed-width
    types. I guess I need something more reserved. I am afraid it would alienate readers
    of my letters a bit. :)\r\n\r\nAny more suggestions?"

    might work nicely with Futura. They also would make a \u2018clear statement\u2019,
    as you put it. Not sure if they\u2019d go well with the content of your letters.

    serif face might be good.\r\nBeton, Stymie and Rockwell are contemporaries of
    Futura, and Beton was produced by the same foundry, Bauer."
