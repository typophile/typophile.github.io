body: "The font in this image is Trade Gothic LT Condensed No. 18. I'd love to use
  this font but unfortunately I can't use images in the website I'm building. Therefore,
  I need to use an alternative such as Typekit or @font-face. Can anyone suggest me
  a font? I was originally going to try BebasNeue but it is a bit heavier than what
  I need.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/design_3645.jpg]"

    and especially in Win XP with standard greyscale rendering.
