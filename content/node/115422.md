    work on this -- witness their optical sizes, and the newer \"catalog\" fonts.\r\n\r\nAnd
    it depends somewhat if you're after theory -- academic study -- or results in
    the contemporary digital world. If the former, by all means include Dowding (and
    <cite>Factors in the Choice of Type Faces</cite> London: Wace,  1957,  would likely
    be a better resource than <cite>Finer points</cite>...). But if not, contemporary
    studies should be more accurate in details."

    Multple Master Typefaces]] is still a very good source. Tim Ahrens has written
    a book about this, and [[http://blog.justanotherfoundry.com/2013/06/re-publishing-our-book-on-optical-sizes/#more-58|it
    is being revised for a second edition.]]  I haven't had a chance to read it, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nSome
    optical adjustments such as larger x-heights and looser letter spacing for small
    sizes I think are pretty universal, and traditional. But there is still a lot
    of experimentation, with different designers trying to solve these problems each
    in their own way.   "

    the difference between <code>cmr5</code> at 10pt and the normal 10-point font,
    <code>cmr10</code>? Plenty; a well-designed font will be drawn differently at
    different point sizes, and the letters will often have different relative heights
    and widths, in order to enhance readability. (Donald E. Knuth, <em>The TeXbook</em>,
    1996: 16)</blockquote>\r\n\r\nand a few similar loose remarks. It's a standard
    feature of TeX, but probably only used with the original set of Computer Modern

    that's certainly true in the sense in which you meant it - that they usually didn't
    write about how they did it - there is other data that they left behind besides
    the fonts themselves.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of Monotype typefaces, there
    would be the set widths for the different sizes of type. In the case of the ATF
    foundry type catalogs, alphabet widths are listed, the sequence of which shows
    the scaling they used for the widths of the different sizes. (And, thanks to <em>Typographical
    Printing-Surfaces</em>, plus mentions in the ATF catalogs of the widths of spaces,
    I know that their foundry type, regardless of point size, was made to a unit of
    1/4 point - so unlike the case with Monotype, individual glyphs will have had
    different scale factors applied at any one size.)"
