body: "Hello everyone. I've been meaning to join a type forum for some time, and I
  just remembered, so here I am! I'm doing a poster for my typography class and just
  want as much feedback as possible. Rules of the project are as follows.. Black and
  white only (or shades of grey) Content is fixed, and must include all of it in the
  poster. Shapes are allowed. We are going through learning the different systems
  and this week's is dilational. If I forgot anything, let me know :) Slam it, please.
  It's far from perfect.\r\n\r\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dilational8.jpg\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dilational8_6432.jpg]"
