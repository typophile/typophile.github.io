  body: "Thanks Paul... very enlightening.\r\n\r\nInteresting that Kennedy would say
    it is unfair to those who do not desire music.\r\n\r\nThe whole predator/victim
    paradigm is getting hilarious. Does anybody believe they won't avail themselves
    to the \"freebies?\"\r\n\r\nSo often I see on the font sites the statement \"I'm
    just a collector.\" The next day the same person is looking for another font for
    a \"JOB.\"\r\n \r\nMichael"

    it's not really a solution that will save the recording industry. It will likely
    save the courts from silly lawsuits."

    away from annihilation. I\u2019d much rather see all the big record labels go
    chapter 7 and just stream the back-catalog from Corbis for a fee than have the
    government levy a piracy tax on me. It\u2019s pathetic that no matter how bad
    it gets these companies will try crazy ideas like this but can\u2019t be persuaded
    to just stop screwing over musicians and consumers alike."
