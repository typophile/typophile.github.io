body: I applied to the Type Media program for this fall, but haven't heard anything
  back yet after I sent my portfolio a few months back. Hopefully I'm not getting
  sent anything by USPS, because the last letter I got from Germany sent through the
  post office took about 5 months to reach me. I know when I've posted on Typophile
  before, some students and faculty from TypeMedia have replied, so I was wondering
  if anyone there could tell me where they're at in the process of choosing students
  for the 09/010 course, and if anyone that applied for the 09/010 TypeMedia course
  has gotten a yes or no regarding their acceptance. I'm in the U.S., so it would
  be be very helpful to know soon. Thanks!

    be made but I estimate somewhere in the next two weeks.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Paul

  body: "Hi Paul,\r\n\r\nI have one other question: I sent Jan Willem Stas my portfolio,
    CV, and letter of intent in February, but I am still going back and forth with
    the US govt. about my passport -- I thought I would have it this week, and they
    just sent me a letter saying I need to supply them with one more form. I will
    definitely have it by the end of this month, but possibly not by the time you
    make decisions about who's going to be in the 09/010 course. Will this have any
    bearing on your decision?"
