body: Are there any uses for thin or hair space where it wouldn't make sense for them
  to be non-breaking? I ask because I can't think of any, and the fact they aren't
  hard spaces makes them pretty unusable in reflowable text such as web. Why did Unicode
  not at least go with two equal sets of spaces, one of which would be non-breaking,
  instead of just a single  non-breaking word space?

    type and should not be breakable. Even in today's world of digital type they are
    still useful.

  body: Agree wholeheartedly with all the responses. They are very valuable as non-breaking.
    I cannot think of a non non-breaking use for them.

  body: "<cite>The intent of those were originally to do fine-tuning by hand on metal
    justified type and should not be breakable.</cite>\r\n\r\nIn the case of characters
    with a place in Unicode, a hairline space indeed should not be breakable, since
    it would be used for letterspacing - or for adjusting kerning (but that is not
    a \"legitimate\" use, because the font is responsible for getting that right).\r\n\r\nBut
    when a hair space was used in metal type, it might well have been used to adjust
    the size of a breakable space between words. Not that text gets to reflow after
    it's set in metal, of course... but it means that the example given here seems
    to contradict, rather than reinforce, the point being made.\r\n\r\n<strong>But</strong>
    this gets me to thinking of some possible pre-Unicode computer representations
    of text, in which a hairline space might have the same meaning as with metal type.\r\n\r\nLet's
    think of an IBM Executive typewriter as a first step to a concrete example. It
    used a coarse 5-unit proportional spacing system; it had typebars, being an ordinary
    electric typewriter otherwise, not a Selectric.\r\n\r\nThe space bar had a little
    \"2\" printed on it, with a segment on the left side having \"3\" on it. The 2
    unit space was the normal word space, the 3 unit space was a wider space which
    took up the same amount of space as a digit, useful for tabular matter.\r\n\r\nThe
    backspace key went back by only one unit.\r\n\r\nSo it didn't have a hairline
    space key that advanced by 1 unit; when justifying lines by a second retyping,
    one would have to remember the sequence 2, 3, 22, 23, 33, 223, 233, 333 to know
    what to type for the successive widths of spaces.\r\n\r\nThus, in a phototypesetter
    system where the unit system is hardcoded and fairly coarse, one could imagine
    a code that stands for a \"one-unit space\" which might be part of a group of
    several spaces, and the sequences of spaces as a whole might be either breaking
    or non-breaking. (Presumably this would be determined by the presence of a \"justifying
    space\" of variable width in the cluster, although a non-breaking justifying space
    is also useful - one doesn't want a non-breaking space to have to be at risk of
    winding up conspicuously narrower than the other spaces on the same line.)"
