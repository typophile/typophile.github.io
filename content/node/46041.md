  It has been brushed by hand and vectored, but I know it needs a lot of work. \r\n\r\nThe
  'airport' font is Bliss, which would be used elsewhere in the identity. The logo
  is for a small airport in a beautiful natural setting. 80% of visitors are tourists.
  So we wanted to create a natural, easy, flowing logo. \r\n\r\nBeing new to this
  some input would be appreciated! Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the word Airport tracked out so it has a more simple and elegant look . . .\r\n\r\nJust

  body: "I'm not so sure a brushscript is so ideal for a logo intended for an airport.\r\n\r\nI
    mean if there are going to be a lot on non-english speakers there, the most simple
    and clean letterforms work best, especially for the wayfinding.\r\n\r\nImagine
    you go to india, and instead of having clearly written signs what if it were all
    done in a stylized calligraphic and you have to find your way around\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm
    not suggesting that you use Univers or Helvetica and destroy what you have, I'm
    just offering a friendly caution.\r\n\r\nIf you continue with the hand-rendered
    stuff, I'd recommend greater letter variations and using only the sans-serif for
    wayfinding and further signage\u2026"

    thought I'd post the Lifetime logo ... it's a brush script with some great character
    to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul
