  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have a company that builds/manages web software as well as providing design services to a small number of clients. For quite a while we&rsquo;ve looked at changing our logo to a simple wordmark. However; finding a perfect font that &ldquo;just looks right&rdquo; for our company name has proved elusive. We&rsquo;re great at designing stuff for other people but our own seems to be an achilies heel. To be honest, it&rsquo;s now driving me crazy lol.</p>
<p>People on here are extremely knowledgable about fonts (more so than me) so I thought I&rsquo;d reach out for some help. If you suggest a font and we decide to use it, I will send you $200 (or £125 / €150) via PayPal.</p>
<h2 id="brief">Brief:</h2>
<p>i)   The name of the company is Aylis
ii)  Letters can be upper/lower (Aylis AYLIS aylis)
iii) Wordmark only (no icon).
iv)  No restrictions on style.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules:</h2>
<p>i)   No limit on suggestions but be sensible; don&rsquo;t spam every font you can think of.
ii)  No &lsquo;close date&rsquo; (if/when a font is chosen, it will be announced on here and the winner will get paid).</p>
<p>iii) <strong>ALL suggestions must be a link to a page or an embeded image that depicts our name using the font. Posts that say things like &ldquo;Check out FontX&rdquo; will be ignored.</strong></p>
<p>You might only be a suggestion away from a nice bit of spending money (plus I really need some help lol). Get suggesting!</p>
<p>Cheers
Dave</p>

<p><cite>iii) Wordmark only (no icon).</cite></p>
<p>Does this imply that:</p>
<p>i) One cannot draw something new from scratch
ii) One cannot manually adjust an existing font (outlines)
iii) One cannot manually adjust an existing font (spacing)
iv) It has to be a commercially available font?</p>
<p>Would you use this font suggestion just for your company name, or do you expect to also use it for other purposes, such as full text, or a web page?</p>

<p>This is called “working on speculation” (spec) and is considered by many to be highly irresponsible, unprofessional and even disrespectful to the practice. It takes advantage of young designers trying to enter the field and devalues what we do as professionals. If you want a quality product, find the right person for the job and pay them their fee. As you would a doctor or lawyer.</p>

<p>Most professional designers I know charge in the range of $75 - $150 an hour, and a complete identity system costs thousands. $200 wouldn&rsquo;t even cover the time spent making phone calls and emails.</p>
<p>Start with a long meeting with the client to discuss their company and what they&rsquo;re trying to communicate. Spend time doing research (for example you need to know what their competitors use). Come up with concepts. Have a 2nd meeting with the client. Continue this thru several rounds until a final logo is chosen. Make the final art. Design the letterhead, envelope and card, and after approval make final art. Get estimates from printers. Meet with the printer, then later review the printer&rsquo;s proofs, and then maybe do a press check when the stationery is being printed. Design the signature line for corporate emails, and maybe design some common forms (fax, etc). Design and prepare a corporate identity manual (a big job in itself). And so forth. It&rsquo;s a LOT of work.</p>

<p>That being said, €150 just for <cite>suggesting a typeface</cite>? Sounds fair enough to me. I might give it a shot. I&rsquo;m sure, as Gerhard suggested, that many designers are doing whole identities for less. In fact, by saying what he said, I think he kind of undercut the whole argument…
Also, many young designers will often do stuff for free just to get some work under the belt, so getting paid for suggesting a typeface? Not too bad. Some of us feel like, at this point, we have to take whatever we can get.
Yes, ethics. But let us not forget what we&rsquo;re working for, in the end: not ethics; money. Doctors and lawyers and accountants too. And while <cite>I</cite> don&rsquo;t really much care for money and don&rsquo;t want it, <cite>most people</cite> (he said, unnecessarily ironically) who can get me the stuff I really want and need <cite>do</cite>. So when I decide I no longer want anything (because in reality that&rsquo;s what I need), I&rsquo;ll stop bothering. Until then…</p>
<p>davefish, might you give us some more information about the company and/or perhaps where you&rsquo;re trying to go (with your logo)?</p>
<p>So yes, I understand this argument I&rsquo;ve seen many times and agree with it; but this is also a kind of bullying, because this argument makes people who would otherwise do this feel guilty for doing stuff for money. And you all do it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how involved you are or how creative or how ethical or how serious; doing stuff for money is doing stuff for money. It&rsquo;s all bad. It&rsquo;s all selling out. We&rsquo;re not talking about killing someone, we&rsquo;re talking about suggesting a typeface. People who do not participate in contests – for whatever reason – are equal to people who do.</p>

<p>This is an <strong>exact</strong> example of spec work. It takes education, knowledge, experience, skill and time to select an appropriate typeface for a context. To do so in anticipation of being paid is the very definition of speculative work. We are being asked to design a “<em>iii) Wordmark only (no icon)”</em> in hopes of getting paid. I’m amazed there is even a conversation about this.</p>

I thought it would be nice to show my appreciation for help by offering a reward. I don&rsquo;t see how this is &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo;, &ldquo;unprofessional&rdquo; or &ldquo;disrespectful&rdquo;.

<p>Exactly. I haven&rsquo;t posted it anywhere else. I posted it on Typophile because I am specifically requesting help with font selection. I haven&rsquo;t gone to a crowd sourced logo farm or anything like that (the logo&rsquo;s we produce inhouse are superior). What I&rsquo;m after is a starting font. We can handle the subtle tweeks to the letters, kerning etc&hellip; I&rsquo;ll never understand how posting the same question and expecting free help is better than offering a gift to fellow pro&rsquo;s for their time ;-)</p>

<p>Dave, I think what rubbed many people the wrong way were the rules. Don&rsquo;t submit this, don&rsquo;t submit that, must look good in uppercase, etc&hellip; If you were to ask for a gratis font suggestions, having these sort of restrictions would&rsquo;ve not yield you a single response. With the money in the picture it looks like you feel entitled to dictate your conditions and to tell people how to answer. That turns the topic from a friendly discussion into something more formal and business like. Hence the reaction.</p>

<p>Then, anything by Underware, really, but mostly one of Auto’s italics or Bello:
<img src="/images/old-images/propostas_AutoBello_6477.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, looking at Liza, I realized you could (maybe just almost) do an ambigram, something like so:
<img src="/images/old-images/ambi_aylis_02_3630.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t really working, readability-wise, so maybe you could just go really wild, like so:

<p>Which kind of brings us back to the butterfly.

I was specifically trying to get away from squarish stuff, though. I get that you might like it or find it more suitable in some way, but I think you could use something more lively, more life-infused. You shouldn’t want to look square. Well, not <cite>that</cite> square, anyhow. Something not based on a typeface would be nice.
You’ll probably also run away from seriffed faces, but [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/font_rend.php?idt=f&amp;id=59846&amp;t=o&amp;rt=aylis&amp;rs=96&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;w=560&amp;update=0|what about Fedra]]? With some added kerning, of course.</div>

It's a bit too whacky/quirky (and reminds me of surfing..) in current form but love the way the letters work together. Needs some tweaks to tone it down and make it more classy/elegant. My thinking was less slant on the letters and a wider range of line thickness but I could be wrong.
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t think of a solution but $50 gift to any who does. Thanks to all.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>And the $200 promised for suggesting the chosen font &ndash; &ldquo;If you suggest a font and we decide to use it, I will send you $200&rdquo;?  Didn&rsquo;t quite turn out that way, did it?  Any custom font tweaks should be at your own expense and not taken from the winner&rsquo;s reward.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me Dave - what about that is fair? Shame on you for turning this little shenanigan into spec work. I was fine with your concept of offering a reward for suggesting a font, but it appears you have no problem asking for someone to revise a logo to &ldquo;potentially&rdquo; earn $50. I hope your clients see that you&rsquo;ve had to resort to these kinds of tactics to design the logo for your own &ldquo;design agency.&rdquo; You should lose sleep over this, and frankly, you owe an apology to everyone on this thread.</p>

It would have been more unfair to let someone come in at the last minute and take $200 for tweaking Josh&rsquo;s proposal. The $50 was simply put out there in case anyone had an idea on how to change it. My expectation was well under an hours work.
