body: I&#39;m fortunate to have a nice exhibition calalogue project in 2005, which
  gives me time to research type. The artist is female, from the Netherlands. She
  works in video and photography, and often shoots young people in the awkward stages
  between childhood and adulthood. <BR> <BR>Every book of her work to date has taken
  a very similar approach. I&#39;m finding it difficult to narrow my choices, and
  would appreciate any input from this excellent community as to type that might be
  appropriate. The text will be relatively short.

  body: A previous book featuring this artist&#39;s work made use of Fred Smeijers&#39;
    FF Quadraat. <BR> <BR>Gerrit Noordzij&#39;s Ruse seems like a candidate, but I
    don&#39;t see the artist&#39;s country of origin as the primary factor. Thematically,
    the works seems international, and Ruse is beyond the budget. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the suggestion.

  body: For some reason <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000073">Delicato</a>
    comes to mind for this. Delicato is a text font and has all the necessary features,
    but its quirkiness makes me think of a text type going through puberty. It&#39;s
    not clumsy, but some of the elements just stick out... Something like that. <BR>

    working on the &#34;help yourself that the sky helps you&#34; quote. Maybe another
    drink would help.

  body: OK, seriously, take a look at <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=fonts">Underware</a>.
    I think either Dolly or Sauna &#40;or a combination of the two&#41; might be appropriate
    as well. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m afraid to see what someone pulls out of those font names...

    Sans Ultra Bold</a>. This face always reminds me of mis-inflated baloons. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m kind of kidding. I actually agree with the Underware suggestions.

    may have been too cheeky for &#34;display&#34; It was well formed however, particularly
    at the baseline. The steamy quality made it look like a hot metal specimen. <BR>:-&#41;

    means &#34;wood&#34; in Finnish. <BR>It is a pity that those typefaces have short-lives,
    <BR>I will make a delicate revival ASAP.
