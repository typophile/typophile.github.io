  body: "Interesting! Since I have the original, in color, I know that the font is
    not actually hand-tooled. It's just the shadows and texture of the font that give
    that impression in this scan. So if you leave out the hand-tooled part of it,
    does that help track down the font?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kristen\r\n\r\nI would have guessed Goudy Handtooled but there are a couple
    of problems. Goudy rarely, if ever, did his cap R tails like that. It is also
    extremely rare for an \"open, engraved, inline, handtooled\" metal typeface to
    have the opened area of the letterform on the right side. Most commonly they are
    directly down the center or on the left. The reason for this is that the strength
    of color is usually on the left and during presswork this would help keep the
    letterform open. If on the right, to compensate for overall color, more ink might
    be required and the opened area would fill. As it has obviously in the example.\r\n\r\nGerald"
