  Quark 6.5, OS X10.4\r\npc: Quark 4.1, OS Windows 98\r\n\r\nI'm having difficulty
  with the appropriate font formats, especially as I don't have a version of Quark
  6 to test fonts on.\r\n\r\nI figured that a TrueType flavored OpenType font would
  work in both platforms, but apparently Quark 6 in OS X doesn't recognize the necessary
  CE characters in my fonts.\r\n\r\nWhat's the answer? "

    with \"massaged\" encoding vectors (well, let\u2019s call it \"hacked\"), where
    one and the same font works fine on QuarkXPress 4.x, 6.x and 7 on both Mac and
    Windows, as well as in Adobe Creative Suite applications, Macromedia applications
    and Microsoft applications. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you may want just deliver Mac Type
    1 fonts encoded as Mac CE and Windows Type 1 fonts encoded as Windows CE. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    I have to make Mac CE fonts with FontLab:\r\n\r\nFont Info > Encoding and Unicode\r\n>
    Supported codepage: 1250 Latin 2: Eastern European\r\n> Microsoft Character Set:
    \ Central (Eastern) European, (Latin 2) CP1250\r\n> Mac script and FOND ID: Central

    European\" in Names mode, generate a Windows Type 1 font, then select \"MacOS
    Central Europe\" and generate a Mac Type 1 suitcase. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "BTW, if the Polish customers are complaining that they need a font in the
    \"Western\" script rather than in the \"Central European\" script on the Mac,
    you set Mac script and FOND ID to \"Roman\" rather than \"Central European Roman\"
    and generate the Mac Type 1 suitcases. Of course, you should also make sure that
    the FOND IDs are not 30970 in all the fonts. They should be different but still
    within the respective range (Central European Roman or Roman). \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
