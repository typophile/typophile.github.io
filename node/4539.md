body: 'so i finally got InDesign for my home computer and have been having fun checking
  out the features on some of the different fonts on my machine. I thought it was
  really nice of Microsoft to include FB Californian with all the software that came
  on my laptop &#40;Microsoft Office&#41;. It&#39;s a great face but i was saddened
  that the version i own has no OT features. So i figgered i&#39;d try to add em on
  my own. I became confused a bit about naming conventions for punctuation that is
  used along with small caps and oldstyle figures. which sorts should be labeled &#34;sort.sc&#34;
  and which should be &#34;sort.oldstyle&#34;? Is there any kind of standard for this?
  Is there some resource that outlines such standards?  <BR>A secondary question '

  body: hey thanks for the links eric. i guess i shoulda been more succinct tho. i
    was wondering for example should it be parenright.sc or parenright.oldstyle? that&#39;s
    what i&#39;m confused about at the moment.
