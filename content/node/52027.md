  and modern images for Telephone, Fax, Email and Mobile. I've looked at various wingdings/webdings
  as well as ZapfEssentials, but none of them really work well.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any font suggestions or failing that I could use vector images and paste them
  in (I'm using InDesign).\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."
