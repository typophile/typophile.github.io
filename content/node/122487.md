  body: "Good suggestions particularly Goldenbook and Beaufort.\r\nNew magazine. New
    lettering.\r\nWhen attempting to find a match I find it easier to work from a
    positive rather than a negative image.\r\nFor anyone who wants to try further
    I made this version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OysterReview3SM_3816.jpg]\r\nNote
    the very low contrast. Flare serifs. French curve leg like Goldenbook. \r\nSome
    similarities to Sigvar Serial ExtraLight http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/sigvar-serial/\r\nHas
    some of the Beaux Arts flavor of Grand Central Light http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/grand-central/\r\n\r\n\r\nDon"
