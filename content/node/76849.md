body: "Hi,\r\nI plan to letterpress-print a Xmas card and have a difficulty deciding
  on the colour. I thought about using Pantone 877U or Black 7U.\r\n\r\nThe card will
  be printed on a 100% cotton stock and printer claims silver (PMS 877) doesn't look
  silver but greyish due to the paper high absorbability factor. However, I've found
  an [[http://cloudery.wordpress.com/2009/02/21/spiderling-cloud-letterpress-edition|example]]
  online that looks quite good...\r\n\r\nI haven't seen any sample myself and don't
  have time to organise one so I have to trust someone... Anyone have an opinion on
  how silvery the uncoated silver is? Anyone used 877 or Black 7 on 100% cotton paper?
  Does it look different form normal grey/black? Would you recommend using it?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\nAleksander"

    stock. A \"silver\" will simply look grey unless it's on glossy/coated stock (I've
    made this mistake). Have you considered foil stamping? Otherwise, I would go with
    the black.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "IMO silver ink does indeed look like crap on uncoated stock.\r\nIt doesn't
    shine and looks kind of green and dirty and granular.\r\nThis is my unfortunate
    experience.\r\nOnly the exaggerated letterpress impression redeems the sample
    you link to.\r\nA smooth grey ink would have been better.\r\n\r\nI would recommend
    a matte coated stock for silver ink.\r\nThat would be a lot safer.\r\nI mean,
    why bother with a metallic if you don't let it shine?\r\n\r\n"

    to.\"\r\nNick, can you elaborate? \r\n\r\nI mean, is it at all possible to have
    some kind of shiny effect on uncoated? Maybe by throwing some glitter material
    in the mix?"

  body: "Without the sharp edge provided by the letterpress imprint (or an embossing),
    metallic on uncoated, especially rag, looks blurry. I believe this is because
    the fibre disperses what little light is reflected off the ink in different directions,
    breaking down the sharpness of the edge.\r\n\r\nFor your design, I would recommend
    foil stamping, possibly with a separate hit of embossing (either down or up) to
    sharpen up the edge.\r\nBut the design doesn't have fine detail (e.g. as in type),
    so even a little bit of roughness at the foil edge wouldn't be too bad.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    don't go on my recommendation alone, the best thing to do is to look at printed
    samples that you are holding and shifting to see the effect."

    paper.\r\nIt wasn't all that shiny, but you could tell it wasn't just a muddy
    gray.\r\n\r\nHmm..what if you print an undercoarting of varnish? It's be pretty
    hard to align the two exactly, but it might work."

  body: Thanks. I went with Cool Gray 11. I need to familiarise with letterpress much
    more, that's for sure.

  body: "I kind of bumped into a similar issue, with printing black and silver ink
    on uncoated paper. My advice: go for a paper stock with its structure as closed
    as possible \u2014 so the paper absorbs the least. And, always best, do a test
    run: throw a dozen or so different papers through the letterpress to see which
    one works out best."

    sure I saw a sample of silver printed over silver on dark stock over at the Studio
    on Fire blog. Also elsewhere I remember seeing an advice of going with white for
    the first layer and then do the silver. This clearly costs more, but at least
    it gives an option to consider."
