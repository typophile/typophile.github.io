  body: "Don't know this font and don't even think it should be considered as. To
    me, looks more like some Elongated Gothic, customized \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/huxley|\xE0-la-Huxley
    Vertical]]\", just need to spot the right base font (spurless /G, /R...) and move/extend
    some crossbars. For instance, you could start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bee/|Bee]]
    which, part of the over-elongated crossbars, is very close to your sample."
