  body: 'Is your father sure it is a font and not hand-lettering? The two i''s are
    slightly different. Also the top of the i''s and the top of the l are different
    whereas in a font they might be expected to be the same. This of course could
    be the result of photography if the logo was on a curved surface. These effects
    could also occur if he had transferred the letters using a Letraset sheet.  '

  body: If you only need the logo, why don't you simply trace & tweak it in Illustrator?
