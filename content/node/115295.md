    Compressed Medium but even if the source is reliable and legal, I still feel uncomfortable
    as it looks very close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/berthold+city|Berthold

  body: "Hi Ryuk, as for Centrum, from FontSite, I too have questions. FontSite has
    343 font families at Fontspring, nothing at Myfonts. I checked Centrum at Identifont
    and it does not exist there. \r\nThis is all the info that Itentifont has on FontSite:\r\n---start
    quote--\r\nFontSite\r\nWeb: http://www.fontsite.com/\r\nA Web site managed by
    Sean Cavanaugh and Joyce Lukaczer, it sells OpenType versions of several typefaces
    licensed from SoftMaker GmbH, as well as some original fonts.\r\nFonts published
    by FontSite:\r\nCombi Numerals Ltd\r\nCombi Numerals Pro\r\nCombi Symbols\r\nCombi
    Symbols CD\r\nCombi Symbols DV\r\nCombi Symbols PDA \r\n---end quote---\r\nThe
    mention of SoftMaker GmbH is suspicious to me, but I don't know.\r\nDoes anyone
    have any good info on the legal status of the FontSite fonts?\r\nDon"
