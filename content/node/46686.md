  a certain appeal.\r\n\r\nAs posted at [[http://typophile.com/node/45994]]\r\nDuring
  the conference we will be auctioning off some unusual items such as metal type matrices,
  letterpress broadsides & books, a deluxe BluRay version of the Helvetica film and
  even a one-of-a-kind ceramic vase by Zuzana Licko. A list is being compiled but
  additional items are welcome. All items will go home with the lucky (or skillful)
  high bidder. Donations are tax deductible and can be brought to TypeCon or mailed
  in advance. All proceeds go towards future SOTA & TypeCon activities.\r\n[[http://typecon.com/]]"
