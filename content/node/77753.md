body: "Grumpy is an extreme headline font with six optical weights. Black 24 is loosely
  based on ITC Grouch by Tom Carnase. It is slightly heavier than Grouch, and many
  glyphs differ notably from it. Grumpy has very tight tracking, and more than 2000
  kerning pairs for overall even colour (if that is possible with this design). \r\nLetterspacing
  method is TNT (that is Tight, Not Touching); a very popular type treatment in the
  seventies and eighties.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grumpy_poster_5251.png]\r\nGrumpy
  is now available from YouWorkForThem:\r\nhttp://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T1308\r\nand

  body: "Nice idea Tomi.\r\nThere is one mass market US female-targeted magazine which
    uses Grouch (or similar Caslon Ad style), but I forget which. At any rate, it
    has a chunky/blobby quality, whereas your optical sizing is very sharp.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    88 (Oldsmobile) and 99 (Gretzky) are cool numbers, but to maintain the old-school
    size vibe, shouldn't they be a multiple of 12, i.e. 84 and 96? "

  body: Thank you, Nick. I did think about going for big numbers, but naming 144 for
    Windows? How do you do that? I don't know how.
