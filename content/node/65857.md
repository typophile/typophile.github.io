  Year's post</a>, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/16911\">Florian Hardwig</a>'s
  Typophile account was upgraded to Short Cap (Moderator) status. Specifically, he
  will pair up with me and Stephen Coles as co-moderators for the Type ID Board. I'd
  like to welcome him aboard our team of hard-working volunteers keeping this place
  clean and organised.\r\n\r\nNow it looks like he takes his new role seriously, as
  he has been working backwards tagging loads of past threads. The advantage is that
  you now can easily see which ones have been solved, and which ones haven't yet.
  I invite you to all dive in and have a go at the few unidentified ones. What a way
  to start the new year! :^)"

    do a great job.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "By the way- I recently noticed that the \"What is this font?\" and similar
    phrasing, while ambiguous and annoying, do a great job of bringing traffic to
    Typophile when people type those queries into Google and other search engines...
    So:\r\n\r\nLet's not remove the phrasing altogether- But let's augment the title
    with the information we need.\r\n\r\nso \"Font help needed!\" becomes \"Nike script
    logo: Font help needed!\" (or something similar)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    sounds like a reasonable idea. Although the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?&q=site%3Atypophile.com+what+font+is+this\">~
    9.000 hits</a> that we already got might suffice \u2026 ;-)"

    - what font is it?\r\nto \r\n\"Punkomatisch\" - ornamental serif face with curly
