  wants to appeal to the less traditional bride, but not alienate the more traditional
  bride. She selected the color.\r\n\r\nthanks for your advice![img:sites/default/files/old-images/weddingphotog_4128.jpg]"

    I''d forgo using a font and hand write it. '

  body: You are right, I was just being lazy. Good call! Is the secondary type working
    okay however? Or should I handwrite that too?

  body: "I like it! Just simple as that.\r\nI do have to place one comment: looking
    at the elements it doesn't become clear it is for a photographer. I would like
    to see a few reference points for that.\r\nFurther, job wel done!\r\n\r\nO, one
    thing. I think the centrered text should be equaly placed. It is too perfect.\r\n\r\nWhat
    kind of material will it be presented on?"

  body: "bobbybobo,\r\n\r\nthanks! I know that is my concern too...but I am not sure
    what to do to make it more obvious. To me it would work better for a cake decorator
    or an invite designer or a seamstress ...but what can I do to make it look more
    like a photographer that is not cheesy?"

  body: "Perhaps you can explore the artistic style currently being used, with an
    illustrated camera.  OR perhaps more emphasis on your Name and Title.  The latter
    should read \"Pictorialist\" for an added layer of fun.  A pictorialist references
    the photography folks of the late 1800's and earily 1900's exploring various methodology
    to produce a \"painterly\" effect, and more over, to show the public that Photography
    IS an art.  Your business card has a 1800's Victorian flare to it and I would
    advise that further exploration of that period will give you a unique look and
    feel your looking for.\r\nbest regards,\r\ndaniel"

  body: I personally would not worry about the photography or camera aspect of the
    card. As you said, this is about <em>wedding</em> photography, so lenses and shutters
    are too literal. I think it's great for the purpose, perhaps handwrite the title
    as suggested and, perhaps, try a straight, no nonsense font for the details (for
    contrast).

    the contsraints of the design) and the word PHOTOGRAPHER even more, so that it
    stands out.\r\n2. How about losing one of the lines by combining the e-mail with
    the url, like (info@)loribaetcetera?\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "This is a total design reversal, but if I recall my youth, Victorian pictures
    were often presented in oval frames that contained ornate bric-a-brac designs
    in the corner. So moving the decoration outside of the oval, and putting the information
    inside, where the photo (we called them tin-types back then) went might create
    an impression that is more photographic.\r\n\r\nJust an idea."

  body: I like the 2nd one. I think its more clean, professional. However, you can
    try positioning different way, like rotated it 90 degree counter clockwise, and
    use different typeface for the information, like gill sans or something clean
    and easy to read for larger audience. I like the hand-draw, very cute.

  body: 'As for the type inside the decoration, use your own hand writing. don''t
    be afraid to combine a clean san-serif such as Helvetica or Avenir with the decorative
    design to you info at the bottom of the card. adding contrast between image and
    type sometimes work. '

    than your handwritten attempt in #2. But i agree an original handwritten would
    look better, keep playing with it. I do not think you need to stress the photographer
    aspect at all. If you do maybe make it on the back of the card? Or with a tagline?\r\n\r\n\"making

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThe first one that you had took on this playful, victorian
    meets cute style, and I liked it.  I think that the brown is a much darker value
    - I'm sure if you desaturate this thing, you'll see that the brown is a lot darker,
    and for some reason, it feels like too much contrast - like it's competing with
    the rest of the layout.  \r\n\r\nI liked the victorian elements to the first mock
    up, and think you should push it further in that direction. A lot of cool stuff
    came out of that time period.\r\n\r\nALSO, this all depends on what kind of photographer
    this person is - let their style determine your concept!  If they shoot kids a
    lot, then I think you're headed in a good direction.  \r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\ndaniel"
