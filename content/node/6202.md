body: Some observations of Macworld SF, 2003.  <BR>  <BR><b>Safari.</b>  <BR>All the
  rumor sites were calling this iBrowse. What, as   <BR>in, eyebrows?   <BR>  <BR>I
  was skeptical about Apple&#39;s latest foray--I thought the   <BR>browser war was
  over and IE won the oversized belt   <BR>buckle--until I tried it. It&#39;s pretty
  sweet. That is, for a beta.   <BR>If it proves to be as standards compliant as they
  say,   <BR>hopefully browser compatibility won&#39;t be as big of an   <BR>issue
  as I&#39;m inclined to think.  <BR>  <BR>The speed looks promising, but leave it
  to Apple to   <BR>innovate with the interface. The thing sorts bookmarks   <BR>as
  deftly as iTunes handles MP3s. The built in Google   <BR>search is a nice feature.
  One that I miss when I&#39;m   <BR>surfing with IE now. The interface is much leener
  than   <BR>IE--the top of the browser window, including all the   <BR>buttons and
  address bar, is exactly half the height of   <BR>Explorer&#39;s. The address bar
  doubling as the progress   <BR>bar is genius. <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari"
  target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/safari</a>  <BR>  <BR><b>Keynote.</b>  <BR>Nobody
  can kill PowerPoint, nobody. But Apple   <BR>provides a compelling reason to try.
  First off, if this   <BR>could not import or export Microsoft&#39;s PPT format I   <BR>wouldn&#39;t
  give it a second glance, but alas it does. The   <BR>anti-aliased text, made possible
  by OS Xs quartz   <BR>engine, and ability to dump to Quicktime and PPT as I   <BR>said,
  make this an app I&#39;d be willing to try. And anything   <BR>beats Microsoft&#39;s
  kludgy, counter-intuitive application   <BR>design &#40;have you ever tried to use
  a master page in   <BR>PowerPoint? Ick.&#41;  <BR>  <BR>I still think Adobe could
  one-up this sucker by creating   <BR>an add-on for InDesign. Imagine creating presentations   <BR>in
  an app as familiar as InDesign... Oh well.  <BR><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari"
  target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/safari</a>  <BR>  <BR><b>17 inch PowerBook</b>  <BR>Does
  anyone have a need for this stealth-bomber of   <BR>laptops? There&#39;s no way
  this will replace a high quality,   <BR>true color monitor on my desk. If they&#39;re
  trying to appeal   <BR>to designers and creative types, why not lower the price   <BR>of
  their delectable 22&#34; flat panel cinema displays.  <BR>  <BR>Then again, I may
  want one of these when I grow into   <BR>my size 14 shoes.  <BR><a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html"
  target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html</a>  <BR>  <BR><b>12
  inch PowerBook</b>  <BR>Now we&#39;re talking. Not that I would ever want one of   <BR>these
  either, but if I were traveling Europe for a summer   <BR>with nothing but a backpack
  and a rail pass I surely   <BR>would.  <BR>  <BR>Too bad Apple already exhausted
  their &#39;road warrior&#39;   <BR>campaign on their iPurse &#40;ahem, the old candy
  colored   <BR>iBooks of 1999&#41;.  <BR><a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html"

  body: I should&#39;ve mentioned that Apple is pioneering yet  <BR>again with the
    announcement of Airport Extreme using  <BR>802.11g wireless protocol &#40;fully
    five times faster than  <BR>current wireless standard&#41; and of their new, doubly
    fast  <BR>FireWire. You&#39;ll recall Apple pioneered both USB and  <BR>the original
    FireWire. &#40;Ahem, Go Apple!&#41;

  body: What&#39;s the native resolution on the Apple 22-inch screens? The impression
    I get is that although the screen is big, so are the pixels, so all you really
    gain is some area on the width. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m watching the price on <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=-840&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=9503DG3&amp;storeId=1">these

  body: 'The 23-inch is 1920 x 1200 and the 22-inch is 1600 x 1024. The 22-inch model
    has a dpi of about 87. That&#39;s the model I have and I must say it&#39;s the
    best display of any kind I have ever had the pleasure to use. I try not to think
    too much about how much I paid for it two years ago, given what they&#39;re going
    for now. '
