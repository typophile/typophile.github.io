    really knew when I was hunting for a job in a design studio and wasn\u2019t getting
    any callbacks because my portfolio was a mess and my web site looked like crap.
    Everything looked so bad because instead of fixing it I was sitting around working
    on fonts all day.\r\n\r\n<em>What got you into it?</em>\r\n\r\nGreat typography
    professors.\r\n\r\n<em>Why did you stay here...</em>\r\n\r\nGive me time to stay
    around first. Given the state of the economy and my student loans I might end
    up switching to interaction design/web design."
