  but none of these show these terms when applied to numbers. I wasn't sure if the
  terminology was the same, or different for numbers, but I didn't want to start using
  words to describe features in numbers until I knew for sure. \r\n\r\nFor instance,
  the number 4 sometimes has the diagonal section attached, and sometimes it is detached
  from the stem-like vertical on the right... But I don't know what the official terminology
  is for any of these things.\r\n\r\nIs there someone that could help me out? Any
  imagery would be really fantastic.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Matt"

    horizontal stroke at the baseline of sans serif \u201Cone\u201Ds is a crossbar,
    not a serif.\r\n\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nHowever, there are no established terms to distinguish
    between oldstyle \u201Cone\u201Ds that have majuscule \u201CI\u201D configuration,
    and those which have minuscule \u201Cl\u201D construction.\r\n\r\nThere is also
    no term for the quite odd variant of oldstyle \u201Czero\u201D that is light in
    weight, circular and without contrast.\r\n\r\nAnd again, the variants of \u201Cthree\u201D
    \u2014 with the top half composed of either one curved or two straight strokes
    \u2014 have no special names."

    with serif fonts.\r\nIs my impression correct that virtually all serif fonts make
    it look\r\nlike serifs and not a bar?\r\n\r\nFor the three: the flat-top style
    could be called the Ezh\r\nor Dram form. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezh_%28letter%29\r\nBTW,
    there's also a very rare form of three where the\r\ntop is flat but it's joined
    to the bottom with a curve.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In fact, there is jargon for the flat-topped form of three; it is a \"banker's
    three\", which I believe means that it was the preferred form in handwritten accountancy
    to distinguish it from a sloppy two. That said, \"pointy three\" and \"rounded
    three\" serve me fine and laymen understand them.\r\n\r\nI accept that the serif-analogues
    on \"I\" and \"1\" in sans faces are \"bars\", but not necessarily \"crossbars\".
    \"J\" can be capped with such a bar, and there are forms of \"J\" that also have
    an actual crossbar, in the middle. I've seen \"barred I\" before. If they need
    a specific name of their own, and I think they do, \"endbars\" could work.\r\n\r\nThe
    (usually) sloped thing on the top of a \"1\", be it a serif or not, may be sensibly
    called a \"beak\" and so any form that has it would be \"beaked\"."

    banker's three originally prevented it being converted into an eight when written
    on a cheque.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have terms for a 2 that does the Helvetica thing
    of changing direction on the spine rather than coming straight to an acute angle
    at the bottom?"

    Arabic numerals -- which the Arabs call Indian numerals -- or to Arabic letters
    also?

  body: I kinda recall seeing the flat-top three and the barred seven called French
    three/seven. Also, I think that the old-style numeral 1, when it looks like a
    squashed I, is said to be 'roofed'. But, I could easily be wrong on both counts.
