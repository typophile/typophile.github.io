  i'm currently designing an corporate identity for a music studio and am a little
  stuck with the typography.\r\n\r\ni designed the logo with the univers condensed
  bold in all caps. (unfortunately i can't show it to you, but it's pretty simple
  and i'm actually happy with it. so i think it doesn't really matter for my questions)\r\n\r\nanyway,
  i'm now stuck on the further communication media. i should design a letter and a
  website. but i don't really know which font i should take for the large text portions.
  i would like to stick with the univers condensed for titles, special information,
  etc.\r\n\r\nso can i use the condensed font for the large text or is it a typographical
  no-go because of the readability? if so which font would be better? another font
  face of univers? a serif font? i think a serif font would also be good for a good
  contrast but i don't know which one would be a good pair.\r\n\r\nif you have any
  advice or font suggestions i would be really glad to hear them soon. i'm a typo-rookie
  and really helpless at the moment."

    like to stick with Univers you definitely should take Univers 55 Regular for the
    large text."

    any of the other materials. It will weaken the logo and the overall branding.
    If you do, make sure that the treatment is divergent enough that it does not conflict.\r\n\r\nAssuming
    it's a traditional symphony, and there may be text heavy communications, I would
    go with a serif face. What you use for headline text is up to you and a function
    of the overall look and feel of the brand and it's collateral.\r\n\r\n"
