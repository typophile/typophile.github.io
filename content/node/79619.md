  body: "I think it looks very similar to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-schoolbook/\">Century
    Schoolbook</a>. The proportions are slightly different but may have been distorted
    graphically. The tracking is very tight, and may have been contracted more by
    adding stroke to the regular weight. \r\n\r\nThese are not the best letters for
    ID purposes, but I notice the '!' has the same shape.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
