  (C.M). This was never going to be an easy task. But I am reasonably happy with what
  I came up with.\r\n\r\nI think if I looked long enough I would be able to see some
  faults with the design, but for the time being it will stay as it is (I'm not going
  into business any time soon I don't thin).\r\n\r\nI am just wondering what might
  be some suggestions for slight/major alterations and just general thoughts on what
  I have designed.\r\n\r\nThanks for any thoughts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LogoForm_Final_3918.png]"

    me. Try thinning out the stroke that leads into the 'M' so the 'C' will read better.\r\n\r\n

  body: yeah, the whole knot thing at the center feels awkward to me. i would also
    suggest at least trying to simplify it; perhaps having the letters connect at
    either the top or the bottom, but not both. but since you already said you're
    happy with it and don't plan to change it, i guess that's that.

    with a simpler knot that doesn\u2019t connect, and then add a small flourish to
    the end of M to balance things out."

    it any time soon - but if I do go into business on my own, I may wish to give
    it some tweaks before using it."
