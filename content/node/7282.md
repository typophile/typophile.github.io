body: 'Hello everybody <BR> <BR>this is about a poster for a small theater in town
  and is the poster i mention to the General Discussions board at the &#34;S/M Typeface
  Wanted&#34; string.  <BR> <BR>The story: the tragic documentation of  a stong and
  deadly passion among 3 persons: a couple and the best girl-frient of the woman.
  Love and hate is total and exist at the same time. Violence is both physical and
  phsycological. There is no logic and ethics, only the power of passion which in
  the end leads to the death. <BR> <BR>There is no real story that i can describe,
  since the play is based more on the emotions of the scenes than their plot. <BR>
  <BR>The poster: A and B are the first approaches. They chose B and so we moved to
  F1,2,3 expecting to select the final. I am sorry that i posted the work so late,
  but everything happened very fast. Actually i posted the work because one week ago
  i asked for appropriate font to the theme &#40;&#34;S/M Typeface Wanted&#34; in
  General Discussions board&#41;. <BR> <BR>Eventually being ispired from what everybody
  kindly send i designed the lettering for the title &#40;as you see it needs hell
  a lot of work&#41; but i couldn&#39;t make it work with the poster. <BR> <BR>Have
  a nice day, christos <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51773.jpg"

  body: Sweet, I think the font is ideal and the directions are accurate to your description!
    <BR>I am partial to F1, however, I feel like the incorporation of the man/woman
    bathroom icons isn&#39;t successful from the cardboard concept. Their basic rounded
    forms feel foreign to the harsh angles and intense imagery, and the font, too.
    My suggestion would be to try redrawing these characters, make fit. &#40;though
    this message may just be too late!&#41; <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>aaron

  body: 'Hello Aaron  <BR> <BR>i understand your objection but i disagree. I like
    the differentiation between the elements and i believe it works in this sceptic:
    this process of destruction leaded by the passion can take any &#34;ordinary&#34;
    person and make him/her go to the edges. Also the story starts very &#34;normal&#34;
    to end up in &#34;flames&#34; of sensuality and death.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t agree
    to make the figures &#34;more fit&#34; because i think then their presence would
    be useless. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the feedback <BR> <BR>christos'

  body: How important do you feel the gun is to the poster Christos? <BR>&#40;Maybe
    a stupid question&#41; I don&#39;t see it as a necessary element. <BR> <BR>For
    whatever reason, F3 reminded me of a negative from a  <BR>camera that has been
    dangerously spliced apart, and from there  <BR>I thought of voyeurism. The contrast
    of the white and the blood  <BR>red is also more appealing to me. Can you use
    the word  <BR>appealing in the context? <BR> <BR>You really need to pics that
    aren&#39;t so wide. Don&#39;t mind  <BR>scrolling down forever, but reading loooonnnggg
    lines of text <BR>is a little bit of a pain. :^&#41;

  body: 'tiffany: the gun is a basic element in the last  <BR>scenes and the director
    would like to have it  <BR>on the poster. Maybe is too literal... <BR> <BR>The
    black lines really are inspired by film  <BR>negatives and to be honnest i am
    not sure  <BR>i understand your last question &#40;&#34;Can you  <BR>use the word
    appealing in the context?&#34;&#41;.  <BR> <BR>As for the looooooooooooong lines
    you are  <BR>sooooooooooo right that i cannot disagree.  <BR>I also get tired
    of that and usually i care  <BR>to brake the lines. <BR> <BR>christos'

    man/women sign. <BR> <BR>appealing: mostly a joke. the idea that s/m might be
    appealing in general. =^D'
