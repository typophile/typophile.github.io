  Cap. All i want to do is check my kerning/metrics in the metrics window, but I can't
  figure out the Fontlab manual \u2013 how do you type the swashed character in?\r\n\r\n"

    Font window and hit \u201Ccommand option shift M\u201D, which will open the Metrics
    window with those glyphs showing."

  body: "What a pain! In FontForge (still the old MacPorts version), I can type the
    text, select the features kern, ss01, ss03, ss04 and get the result in the kerning
    window.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerning_5054.png]\r\nHere the font
    is Hypatia."

  body: "You can do the same thing in FontLab Studio in the Preview window. Even applying
    kerning.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it doesn't show the numeric readouts in that window;
    you'd have to paste the list of resulting back into the metrics window. So I'll
    grant that the FontForge approach is slightly better integrated."

  body: That Font Forge Metrics Window looks dreadful. How can anyone space letters
    with those vertical lines running between each pair? Ouch! Can they be hidden?

  body: "Those lines disappear when we are actually kerning, so I find they provide
    useful information without bothering too much. They were removed in the github
    implementation. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kern_4800.png]\r\nMaybe
    it looks better but for me functionality is more important. One of those functionalities
    I can't do without is python."

    post) and that \"cute\"  kerning window in the github FontForge version changes
    the side bearings instead of kerning; what a mess!*At least my old MacPorts version
    does its job.\r\n\r\n*See post below. It is just some default values that were
    changed."
