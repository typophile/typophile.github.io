body: "Hi everybody,\Lcould somebody give my advice where can I find some information
  about reverse italic from history? or upright italic? Where can I find some left
  leaning text typeface? (I don't mean typefaces used for german cartographic maps)
  Thanks."

  body: "Hi, there are a few notes in the book \xBBKursiv\xAB (Henrik Weber | Niggli)
    about upright and left cursives. But not a bunch of information, unfortunately.
    For upright italics you could research a bit in the direction of ff seria or vllg
    odile (there are certainly more).\r\nAlso I am currently working on a left italic
    semi script for gestalten fonts to be delivered by end of February.\r\nSince i
    like this genre as well, i am curious what you intend to do with these?"

  body: Hi, is this book also in English? Well, I'm interested in this kind of type
    because my handwriting is also left leaning, so I would like to find out how people
    with this handwriting can perceive it in text, but also how impression can feel
    other people. So mostly I'm keen of reverse italic. I'm looking forward when I
    will see your version :)

    link contains a (very short) amount of history, but you might try contacting the
    designer for any research he may have conducted."

  body: "(Oh sorry, i am new here and missed the updates on this thread)\r\n\r\nno,
    this book is in german, unfortunately. There is not much information about this
    as well.\r\n\r\ni will try to translate in short:\r\n\r\n\xB7 they were/are rather
    marginally relevant\r\n\xB7 origins from diverse applications as the need for
    more than one distinction\r\n\xB7 most important ambit: cartography (mainly for
    river names)\r\n\xB7 usage in advertising industry for unique effects\r\n\xB7
    from time to time still seen on posters and other advertising media\r\n\r\n\xB7
    in the division of handwriting it occurs much more\r\nthis seems to be less attributable
    to some templates than rather a product of individual handwriting\r\n\r\n(like
    you told for your case)\r\n\r\nand then I remember some templates in the (spencarian
    (?)) penmanship books (available in the web)\r\n\r\nI hope this could help a bit"

    legible even at very small sizes.
