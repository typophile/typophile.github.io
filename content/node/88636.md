  image]] (about from a document of the 1936) I've found 3 interesting fonts, maybe
  they are well known but I really can't identify them. Could someone help me?\r\n\r\nFirst
  (italiano):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font1_5862.png]\r\n\r\nSecond
  (aeronautico):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font2_6429.png]\r\n\r\nThird
  ([cert]ificato di navigabilit\xE0 (aeromobili pi\xF9 pesanti dell'aria)):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font3_6652.png]\r\nPS:
  this last one has the uppercase similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/mephisto/mephisto/|Mephisto]],
  but it don't have the lowercase."

  body: "Looking at the showing of Lafayette in Dan Solo's \"Victorian Display Alphabets\"
    book, it's hard to see how you can get to this sample, because the u (for example)
    looks so much more closed in the actual typeface. I see that this was digitized
    for the Victorian font collection that Solo did for Dover Books. I'd guess the
    online copies are unauthorized ripoffs. \r\n\r\nDick, if you have the font, can
    you simulate the posted sample?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I searched MyFonts for the Solotype fonts, suspecting that if he wanted to
    include this font he would need to change the name, since 'Lafayette', with a
    different design, is a Font Bureau font these days. It's not exact, but look at
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/webster/|Webster]]. If you add stroke
    to make it bolder, it matches the sample pretty well except for the 'r', which
    could be modified easily enough. Solo says 'Webster' came from the Keystone Foundry
    in 1888, but he mentions that numerous other foundries had versions. My guess
    is they were 'inspired' by \"Alexandra\" from the German Bauer foundry. The practice
    was apparently common for foundries to copy popular typefaces and rename them,
    maybe with minor design variations.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the sample I gave is from 1936 and the catalog seems to be from this 1900 book:
    http://www.flickr.com/photos/fountaineer/408623158/in/set-72157594566933925/ so
    maybe lower cases are an addition, but it's hard to say: follow your ideas, I
    found this font (called Gable Antique Condensed), also from Bauer and condensed
    (lower cases r and m look different): http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/gable-antique-condensed-sg/\r\nLater
    I found American Type Founders Company 1885 catalogue (http://archive.org/details/specimensofprint00amerrich)
    where we can see:\r\n- Webster at pag. 263\r\n- Washington at pag. 280 (I think
    it match my sample)\r\n- Jefferson at pag. 281\r\n- Lafayette at pag. 282\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That is a great site and I agree that Washington looks like the right width.
    I think that is your answer, but I think it's clear that the American versions
    added the lower case, as an expansion of the older design. The Petzendorfer book
    does not give a year for the \"Alexandra\" design, but it would be interesting
    to confirm that it is older than the American versions in the ATF book. 1885 is
    in the Art Nouveau period, so there may not have been a big difference in years.
    Maybe this is too academic for your question?\r\n\r\nThat was fun.\r\n\r\n- Mike
