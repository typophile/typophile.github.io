body: My friend Harold Lohner has been looking into some typefaces used by Hitchcock
  in his films, as possible candidates for being digitized. &#40;He has already done
  gaumont and gainsborogh, from the 39 steps and the lady vanishes respectively&#41;.
  He asked if I could tell him if this type has already been digitized, and as far
  as I could find the answer seems to be no. <BR> <BR>Do any of you recognize this
  type, and do you know if it exists as a font? <BR> <BR>Notice the stemmed U, the
  curved T crossbar &#40;not so obvious in this sample&#41;, the pointed M, and the
  Optima-like unevenness of the strokes. It is not Optima or Stellar, which were the
  closest things I could see. I have more samples from him, if you need them. This
  one shows the best sample of letters. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/53408.jpg"

  body: BTW, this is Harold of <a href="http://www.haroldsfonts.com" target="_blank">Harold&#39;s
    Fonts</a> who has asked me to see if you can help. He has been very good about
    recognizing the sources of his fonts, and does a good job of finding old fonts
    to digitize. I&#39;d sure like to help him if we could. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: Well, thanks for looking Mark. That&#39;s good enough for me. If anyone else
    thinks this type looks familiar, please chime in. <BR> <BR>This is a case where
    &#39;no news is good news&#39;, because Harold may digitize this face if it hasn&#39;t
    been done before. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll wait another day before relaying Mark&#39;s
    answer, if no one can come up with an ID.

    &#40;Phil&#39;s Homage&#41;. <BR> <BR>Hope you don&#39;t find it. <BR> <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: Thanks Ignacio. That&#39;s actually closer than most Sans faces I found, but
    it&#39;s still not the same typeface. I also noticed, while looking at Arnholm
    Sans in Phil&#39;s book that <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/"
    target="_blank">&#39;Lydian&#39;</a> is rather close, in such letters as U, G
    and M, but the R is wrong and the strokes are simpler &#40;to state the most obvious
    features&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyone else? Yves? Going twice...

  body: Hi Mike, frankly I haven&#39;t got the faintest clue. I suspect it is  <BR>Zapf&#39;s
    work or someone ripping off his style quite skillfully. <BR>Isn&#39;t it possible
    early display versions of Optima included  <BR>alternate characters?

    I hesitate to say this was a custom job, but it&#39;s possible. At one time, all
    movie titles were hand-lettered. It doesn&#39;t seem too far fetched as a theory.

  body: I have already written back to Harold saying we came up with nothing.  I asked
    him to let me know if he decides to go ahead and digitize it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for giving it a look.
