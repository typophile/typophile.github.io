body: "I've seen this nice light extended slab serif typeface on 50s-60s signage,
  parking garages, schools, libraries, and old wood type block printing, but could
  never identify it! It's not Adore, Memphis, Serifa, Egyptienne, Beton... but it
  kind of resembles an extended Stymie, especially with the pointy bottom of the \"N\".
  I used to admire it daily on my way to the A Train in Bed-Stuy on a school on Malcolm
  X Blvd.\r\n\r\nthanks all,\r\nScott\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/light_slab_serif_retro_4169.png]"

  body: "Yes, very close, all of them, especially Hellenic Wide. It's just the pointy
    \"N\" that's different. Probably was just customized. Any other suggested possibilities
    are welcome :)\r\n\r\nScott"
