      But I'm absolutely ignorant when it comes to actual bitmap fonts; I have no
      idea what formats are being used and what for, let alone what programs are being
      used to create them. How do I take my first steps?\r\n\r\nAs for outline fonts
      that look like bitmap ones, I realize I should use a grid, but I guess not any
      grid will work if I want the result not to be anti-aliased. How do I set it
      up correctly, then? And how do I do it in such way that the result won't be
      anti-aliased in Macromedia Flash as well (if it uses outline fonts at all)?\r\n\r\nTIA"

  body: "David: \r\n\r\nOn MacOS X, bitmap fonts by themselves are not recognized
    at all. However, if they are paired with a TrueType or PostScript font, they will
    show up at small sizes (depending on what size you have set font smoothing to
    kick in). \r\n\r\nOn the classic MacOS (9 and earlier), bitmap fonts can be installed
    and used just like any other font, except when you print to a PostScript printer
    it will not work well or at all. They are also not recognized by some programs
    (e.g., Illustrator).\r\n\r\nOn Windows... I don't know much about using bitmap
    fonts on Windows. (Sorry.) Maybe someone else can step in with that information.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to make bitmap fonts, BitFonter is a good choice. It can export to most
    existing formats and has a relatively nice working environment, similar to FontLab.
    I don't know anything about FONmaker. \r\n\r\nI made a bunch of bitmap fonts years
    ago using the now long-obsolete FONTastic on a Mac Plus, and earlier still, Apple's
    Font Editor (I think that's what it was called), a buggy developer tool from the
    early Mac days (the same one Zuzanna Licko used for her early Emigre fonts).\r\n\r\nYou
    should be aware that software that can use bitmap fonts is becoming rarer. Most
    of the \"bitmap\" fonts you see on modern operating systems are really outline
    fonts being rastered at a low resolution without anti-aliasing, or outline fonts
    made intentionally to look like bitmap fonts (popular with Flash developers).
    (More on this below.)\r\n\r\nOri:\r\n\r\nThere are many different ways to make
    faux-bitmap fonts. Most people work in FontLab or Fontographer, setting up a grid
    as you suggest. The key thing is that the grid needs to divide evenly into the
    em square. For example, if your em square is 1000 units tall, and you want to
    make an 8-pixel tall font, your grid should be set to 250 units. Hint: the em
    square does not have to be 1000, although that is typical for PostScript fonts.
    Also, the character widths must all fall on the same grid.\r\n\r\nSome people
    design their fonts in a program like Photoshop that allows them to work in pixels,
    then, once it looks the way they like, they recreate it in an outline editor.
    An alternative is to use BitFonter to design the fonts and use its \"Pixel Font\"
    export feature to create the faux-bitmap font. I have not tried this, but I don't
    doubt it works fine. (I have not created a faux-bitmap font for a couple of years.)\r\n\r\nFinally,
    if you do it manually, you need to make sure that you do not create a situation
    where you have the corner points of your \"pixels\" at the same exact font coordinate.
    This will lead to filled in counters if you try to use the font in Flash. FontLab's
    BitFonter export takes this into account, as does their FontFlasher program (a
    standalone that takes existing bitmap fonts and turns them into faux-bitmap outline
    fonts). There are a number of ways to work around this issue, including making
    the \"pixels\" slightly bigger and merging the outlines, making the \"pixels\"
    slightly smaller, or simply snipping off one of the \"pixel\" corners.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    this is a deep subject and one that I've become less interested in lately. There
    are others more active in creating this kind of font, and maybe one of them will
    step in with further information."

    unit em square, for a 10-pixel font, each block (individual pixel) element would
    be 72x72; for an 8-pixel font, 125x125; and so on."
