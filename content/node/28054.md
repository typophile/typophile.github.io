body: "I am working on a logo for a skincare association and I am thinking of making
  tweaks to the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/dauphine/\">Dauphine</a>
  typeface. The name of the association is \"DermaTrust\". At first glance, the typeface
  seems a bit thin for smaller sizes as well as screen media (tv) so I increased the
  thickness a bit to compensate, but have I committed a cardinal type sin? I throw
  myself before the group. I would love your thoughts/suggestions. Also, I didn't
  like the \"e\" so I made one real quick to start off.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DermaTrust_LogoIdeations_6225.jpg]"

  body: "I think you have a strong idea going here. But...\r\n\r\nA little more space
    would work wonders. Adjust everything to the same spacing you have around the
    second \"R\".\r\n\r\nAnd: get rid of either the special \"M\" or the special \"R\".
    As it is they're competing for attention.\r\n\r\nI would lose that gap in the
    first \"R\", it annoys me."

  body: I agree with the comment about the M. The M and A bother me because I don't
    want to see anything sharp associated with skin. The bottom of the S needs some
    thickening. Your customized E is top heavy. Consider shortening the crossbar and
    possibly moving it up slightly.

  body: "I wanted to keep the \"E\" middle crossbar at the same height as the \"A\"
    and \"R\" but I agree on the shortening. Also, I took off the point on the top
    of the A but left it in the middle of the \"M\". Do the A and T look a bit too
    far apart?\r\n\r\nHere's another shot\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DT_v3_4525.gif]"

  body: "I like the lower MA better. the first reminded me of a similar raised M in
    (I think) Mont Tremblant (ski hill) where the M looked like mountain peaks.\r\n\r\nYes,
    perhaps too much space between A and T. \r\n\r\nI was a little perturbed about
    the second R, but after a little thought I see it as cradling the U. Kind of a
    caring gesture that works with the concept of trust. Cool. \r\n\r\nK. "

    hook of the S looks broken and forced down too much.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I'm getting mixed emotions here. I'm not sure how I feel about the "cradling
    R" - do you think it draws too much attention or should I leave it in?

  body: "Hi Brent,\r\n\r\nI'm late to the party so I might repeat some former thoughts.
    For that I apologize.\r\n\r\nT -- both seem too narrow in comparison to other
    glyphs.\r\nMA -- creates an odd open shape whereas everthing else appears neatly
    capped off. Even switching from the splayed M would help.\r\nR -- I also wondered
    if the R seemed out of place. Maybe a little overkill?\r\nS -- bottom half seems
    too wide, or top is too narrow.\r\n\r\nSpacing in general seems a hair tight."

  body: "Well, it's a skin care association (like AIGA for designers) for skincare
    professionals. So it's kind of a cross between the AIGA, Aveda and the Better
    Business Bureau. So something like ... \r\n\r\nCertified\r\nTrustworthy\r\nProfessional\r\nSetting
    a standard\r\nKnowledageable\r\nAccountability\r\n\r\nMixed with all the things
    you look for when seeking a skin care professional.\r\n\r\nDoes that give you
    what you were looking for?"
