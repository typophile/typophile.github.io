body: "Before computers, text was set by hand, layouts were cut and pasted by hand,
  and every visual effect was done in the physical realm. Nowadays, computers have
  helped remove a lot of the tedium of design and layout. In a generic sense, computers
  help in the typesetting of text, the layout of pages, the editing of photographs,
  etc. In a more detailed sense, the precision of computers have allowed processes
  like letter-kerning and page flowing more automated (and perhaps less 'perfect'),
  and complex layouts and illustrations that would otherwise be impossible to create
  by hand.\r\n\r\nhttp://sherwooddesignandprint.ca"
