body: "This year, Sears brought back its old \"Wish\" catalog that was absent for
  14 years, visiting a Sears store over the weekend I came across heavy promotion
  of their entire \"wish\" theme, there must have been close to a hundred red in-store
  signage boards with the word \"wish\" prominently in the center, inspiring the holiday
  spirit and nicely decorating everything throughout the store.\r\n\r\n\"wish\" :)
  I could've made a picture of these posters for you to ID the font, so here is a
  banner I found online using the same script font.\r\n"

  body: "I gave this one a good college try, as they say, but I think it is custom.
    The style reminds me very strongly of <a href=\"http://www.typesetit.com/index2.html\">Rob
    Leuschke</a>'s work, and it's possible he did this lettering for Sears, since
    he does a lot of custom work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    seem fairly familiar.\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n"

  body: "Hi Sam, \r\n\r\nI've been away from the Board for a few days, and just saw
    your post. There are roughly thirty of us looking at these posts at any given
    time, and if no one came up with other ideas this suggests more strongly that
    this is custom work.\r\n\r\nI think you might see why I suggested <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Leuschke\">Rob
    Leuschke's</a> work if you go to this link and type in 'Grant a Wish' as the test
    drive phrase. While the details of each font are not consistent with the Sears
    lettering, to me the lettering style seems to fit Rob's work. I know it's just
    a hunch, but I think it's a reasonable one. Sears certainly has the means to hire
    someone to letter three words for all their holiday marketing, I would think.
    This way no one duplicates your look exactly, but Leuschke's work is where I'd
    start to find something that you would perhaps mistake for it, if you didn't have
    them side-by-side.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I wrote an e-mail to Rob Leuschke and he promptly replied that he did not
    do the Sears lettering, but that he believed it was hand lettering (noting the
    different a's). That's the best answer I can give on this one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike, \r\nI appreciate very much your research and effort to help out
    a fella typophile, contacting Rob Leuschke goes far beyond your duty and I'm thankful
    for that.\r\n\r\nI must disagree with Rob's observation that it might be hand
    lettering, the two a's on the sample are not really different in my view (it's
    just different sizes), besides, seeing the typeface in the store I recall it being
    applied on various formats and on different messages (e.g. Merry Christmas, Happy
    Holidays, etc.) and they were all consistent and uniform.\r\n\r\nIf it is indeed
    a custom type like you suggested, I was hoping that the creator might be a typophile
    who could share more info about it (aren't all custom font designers typophiles?
    I guess I need to get out of my bubble...)\r\n\r\nMy next move will be - since
    I'm so love stricken by this script - to go back to the Sears store with a digital
    camera and attempt to capture some nice shots of the signage without being caught
    by security... will let you know."

  body: "Sam, I see your point about the 'a', and you could be right that it's a font,
    but that doesn't mean it's available, if it is a custom design made for Sears.
    We're all fanatics here, so asking the potential designer is one thing we might
    try to do if we're stuck. Now if someone knows the Sears Art Director, that might
    be another avenue to try. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
