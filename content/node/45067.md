    a new identity in ten years.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, what joker convinced them to
    whack customers over the head with a video about the new logo? That\u2019s so
    low class it\u2019s pathetic. To me the whole launch has the feel of a board that
    overpaid for an identity and is insecure about it."
