body: "Hi Folks, \r\n\r\nSomeone sent me this sample to ID. Judging from the small
  x-height, I was guessing this could be a Deco-era typeface. The very odd g and y
  shapes with stubby descenders seems familiar, but has escaped me. Does anyone recognize
  this?\r\n\r\nLooked in Jaspert, and Solotype Catalog, with no success.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n-

    with some added stroke and some tail-clipping of the g and y. That's pretty close
    structurally.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
