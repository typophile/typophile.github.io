  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that someone on here could give me a helping hand. I have been instructed to create some artwork for one of our clients utilising their existing styles and branding. However, they are requesting that we use certain fonts that we do not have and they are not permittted (quite rightly) to give us for this exercise. The fonts that they require us to use are:</p>
<p>Helvetica Infant
Helvetica Infant Hausa
VagInfant Black</p>
<p>Obviously we need to buy these fonts but I can&rsquo;t find anywhere on the www that sells them. Even a quick google search doesn&rsquo;t give any results. Can anyone suggest where I might find these elusive fonts. Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From the names, it looks like your client, or someone else, has created custom versions of Helvetica, Helvetica Hausa and VAG Rounded, and added &ldquo;Infant&rdquo; to their names. I suspect you won&rsquo;t find these specific fonts anywhere, only your client has them. Of course, you could acquire the source fonts, but you&rsquo;d need to find out what alterations were made to them.</p>

<p>Helvetica is so generic that you might be able to ﬁnd an open-source “looks like” that has Hausa support, and which may be adapted to the infant/schoolbook a/ and /g.</p>

<p>My guess is that it&rsquo;s either a custom font as David suggested, or maybe an infant&rsquo;s clothing used helvetica and somehow &ldquo;helvetica&rdquo; and &ldquo;infant&rdquo; got accidentally combined in the product&rsquo;s title, similar to this:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Martin: &ldquo;Infant&rdquo; typefaces are text typefaces that are meant to structurally mimic the very earliest handwriting of small children. The theory is that by making the symbols close to the ideal shape they&rsquo;re taught to write (or rather, at that age, draw) it makes it easier for children to learn reading. (I don&rsquo;t have the exact studies at hand, but I seem to remember from elsewhere that this is not actually verifiable, and may even be outright false.)</p>
<p>If at all, they differ from &ldquo;schoolbook&rdquo; or &ldquo;primary&rdquo; typefaces by being even simpler in construction and, where possible, by being less cursive, and more constructed, just like a four year old will have more constructed writing than a seven year old. [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sassoon/|Sassoon]], a typeface developed by a child psychologist, has an &ldquo;Infant&rdquo; version which is upright, has a low X-height (to clearly differentiate between the two cases), and is stripped down in a reductionist way, and a &ldquo;Primary&rdquo; version which has a slight slant, taller X-height and several other  more handwriting-mimicking features, like a looped k and a q with a tail.</p>

<p>Can they give you sample text set in those fonts? If not, they probably don&rsquo;t have the fonts but have just heard of them.</p>
<p>If they actually have the fonts (perhaps custom fonts), you could prepare layouts on your own computer and then switch fonts using their computer (assuming they have the right software). Or just tell them the fonts can&rsquo;t be purchased anywhere.</p>

This in itself is no verification, but that's actually the first thought I had after you explained what infant typefaces are.
<blockquote>has a low X-height (to clearly differentiate between the two cases)</blockquote>
Does that aid in reading?
<blockquote>If they actually have the fonts (perhaps custom fonts), you could prepare layouts on your own computer and then switch fonts using their computer (assuming they have the right software). Or just tell them the fonts can't be purchased anywhere.</blockquote>
It seems ludicrous though to not be able to share fonts with a design studio if those fonts can't be purchased anywhere else. I understand the design studio isn't allowed to use these fonts for other projects, but how are you supposed to work on a design when you have no access to the correct fonts? Replacing the font on an other computer isn't a great solution as you may experience some shifts in the text. Or are the horizontal metrics the same?</div>
