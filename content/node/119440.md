body: "Im a NY illustrator/graphic designer who is becoming more and more interested
  and obsessed with type design, typography, and logo design. My illustration skills
  certainly help propel me forward into territories of originality and detail but
  I am lacking some basic and more fine tuned type skills. I have been working in
  NY as a graphic designer for several years so I have lots of basic knowledge but
  I am considering diving into this new passion and going back to school for my masters
  in type design/typography/branding- identity design (if that is a real major). Does
  anyone have any suggestions for great programs in NY; both for continuing ed and
  also for a full masters program? \r\n\r\nWhen I have read course descriptions of
  schools they seem very esoteric, for example, \"Design for the Emerging Future\"
  or \"Launching Type into the Ecological World\" Blah Blah Blah. I just want to find
  some great teachers in a great program teaching the real hands-on skills of typography,
  and type design - hand drawn and computer generated. \r\n\r\nThanx in advance,\r\n\r\nChana"

    or classes you recommend?\r\n\r\nChana\r\n \r\n"
