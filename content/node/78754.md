  a otf with some kerning pairs. But when I try to use it in Indesign or Illustrator
  three characters are missing. Its really strange because I can use the font in Pages
  without problems. \r\nI have no clue how this happened or how to fix it  - so advice
  is much appreciated! (help!)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)"

    Any other OpenType features in the font?"

    Layout feature in the font. Add any substitution feature such as\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    liga { \r\n  sub f i by f_i;\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nA."

  body: When I've encountered this problem, the solution usually has something to
    do with the way those characters are named. For example, I can call the space,
    "blankspace" and it will show up as a missing glyph symbol in Adobe apps. Glyphs
    with no unicode can be a problem but that doesn't seem to fit what you described.

  body: "Another thing worth checking in FontLab Studio is Preferences / Generating
    OpenType & TrueType, and the Kerning subsection. \r\n\r\nIn the first page, make
    sure that you have \"Export OpenType layout tables\" and \"Compile feature definitions\"
    enabled. In the Kerning page, make sure \"Generate OpenType kern feature...\"
    is enabled. For TrueType-flavored fonts, it's also definitely recommended to enable
    \"Export old-style...\" and \"Expand class kerning...\". For OpenType PS (.otf)
    fonts, this also won't hurt. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    8. \r\nIt is not making any sense to me, after i kerned some of the letters these
    numbers just disapeared in Adobe programs (cs5)"

  body: "By \"disappeared\", do you mean that they appear as blank spaces?\r\n\r\nI
    run into this problem occasionally, and it can usually be resolved by simply changing
    the start points of the affected glyphs. Exactly what causes it is something I've
    never managed to figure out, though I have noticed that it doesn't occur if you
    turn off all autohinting options, so presumably it involves some interaction between
    hints and startpoints.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "No, the startpoint in this example is the node on the top right of the glyph,
    with a little right-pointing arrow. What you're showing is the reference point,
    which does not affect anything in the font. \r\n\r\nSome other recommended techniques
    to try: \r\n* disable compression using subroutines in OpenType PS export\r\n*
    correct the path direction to \"PS\" for all glyphs\r\n* decompose all composites\r\n*
    perform Glyph / Glyph Names / Generate Unicode\r\n\r\nA."

  body: "hi guys! \r\nim really thankful for your advice :) \r\n\r\nI mean disapeared
    in the way that when i open the  Glyphs palette in Indesign or Illustrator they
    dont show, and if i try to type nothing happens, not even a blank space. But if
    a see the font in Fontbook it is all there, and there is no problem using it in
    Pages. \r\n\r\nI tried redrawing the letters with new startpoint.\r\ncorrecting
    the path to PS for all glyphs and performed Generate Unicode. \r\n\r\nI dont know
    how to decompose all composites or to disable compression?"

  body: "You don't need to redraw the characters to set a new startpoint. Just control-click
    on a point and select 'make node first'.\r\n\r\nFor composite decomposition and
    compression, go to preferences->Generating OpenType and TrueType->OpenType PS
    (.otf) and set the relevant options (alternately, you can decompose composited
    manually from the glyph menu but it's generally a good idea to keep things as
    composites within the .vfb file so I'd use the preference setting instead).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
