body: 'I am making an old fashioned book type inspired by Griffo''s DeAetna type and
  Van den Keere''s romans here at the MATD program at Reading. To test it I have been
  making and collecting one & two page InDesign layouts here at Reading to try my
  type in. Doing this is helping me to find and fix problems with the design. But
  recently it occurred to me that it would be great to have a few more from my pals
  here on Typophile. I can certainly respect the idea that some people will not not
  want to lend me this sort of thing. What I am asking for is a little bit like asking
  somebody for a copy of their typeface! It requires a certain amount of trust. But
  if you are a book designer and you are willing to trust me in this way I will be
  most grateful. And certainly I will not pass these files on unless you explicitly
  say that doing so is okay with you. I will be at the Ditchling conference for the
  next 2 days and will have an unknown amount of internet access so if I don''t respond
  quickly this Sat or Sunday that will be why. Thanks very much! '
