  became popular after WWII.  I'm guessing the typeface is from around WWII, and likely
  European?  Any help would be great!\r\n\r\n*Getting an HTML 0 error.  Can't seem

    for months apparently.

  body: Yeah, I saw that actually.  That thread lead me here.  I was thinking something
    similar to Helvetica (about the same period, I believe) or Pragmatica and then
    altered. But glad you're thinking custom! Thanks!!
