  body: "I'm on a Mac. Now that I've played with it some more I don't think it is
    the Adobe fonts\u2013it looks like it's either related to me disabling some of
    the foreign/display system fonts or just some sort of general permissions issues.\r\n\r\nI
    think that I'm going to wipe this machine over the weekend and set up a script
    that pulls extra crap out of my system font directories every night. I have all
    sorts of horrible problems caused by trying to figure out what fonts I need, and
    what fonts are just worthless junk that some program installed somewhere it shouldn't
    have."

  body: The problems you are having are probably due to the fact that you are disabling
    some fonts which the system needs. (Trust me I've tried managing the system fonts
    myself with scary results.) Read <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301332">this
    article</a> for the support which I think is the best.

  body: "I've actually found that most of the nasty display fonts that come with Mac
    OS can be disabled without trouble: Papyrus, Chalkboard, Impact, etc. This is
    especially important to me, because when I stay awake too long I start hallucinating
    and all type turns into Papyrus, wich is really nasty when one is standing in
    a long passport control line at the Milan airport). \r\n\r\nBut the text fonts
    have to stay untouched; I think my problems were a result of shutting off Gill
    Sans, Hoefler Text, and New York. Which is odd, because I've never seen them used
    for anything.  "

    they get enough bad feedback they will deal with the problem on their end.

    but so what?\"\r\n\r\nBecause having to go sifting through that font menu annoys
    me. It's more annoying when other fonts get dumped into the system fonts directory
    by applications, as those fonts sometimes have screwed up names that Indesign
    and Illustrator will jump to when I'm typing in font names.\r\n\r\nIt would be
    nice if Adobe would add an option to just not display any system fonts inside
    of their apps. FontExplorer X has no trouble picking out the system fonts, so
    maybe if I ask nicely I might be able to get them to make a nice fix for me. "
