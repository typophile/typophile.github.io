  a little thicker. I already used the \"faux bold \" option in photoshop and the
  \"strong\" option as well.\r\n\r\nIs there any trick to make it thicker, like a
  2X faux bold for example? \r\n\r\nIs it safe to Magic Wand it and expand the selection?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"

  body: "Although this is not a reccomendable way to make something bolder,\r\nyou
    may try this:\r\n\r\n+ Type something in your Photoshop\r\n+ Select the text layer\r\n+
    From the top menu, go to > Layer > Layer Style > Stroke...\r\n+ Now you can decide
    the stroke thickness and also can change the color of the stroke as same as your
    text.\r\n\r\nI hope this will help."

  body: "If you're type is already rasterized it's easy. There are two methods.\r\n\r\nMethod
    1. Make a loose selection with the lasso tool and then (holding option or alt)
    deselect the white surrounding the letters. Make sure your tolerance is set low
    for the magic wand. Go Edit/Stroke. Select 1 pixel (Black) on Outside. This will
    add just a tiny bit of weight. If not enough undo and try more.\r\n\r\nMethod
    2. Select around letters again with the lasso tool. Go Filter/Other/Minimum. A
    window will pop up with a preview. Again, try 1 first and see if it's enough.
    \r\n\r\nThe Minimum command tends to be a little heavier in adding weight, but
    is usually smooth. I think if your type remains vector you might also be able
    to convert it to a path and stroke that path in the paths menu. I haven't tried
    that so can't help you there.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: If at all possible I'd add the stroke/make outline stroke thicker in Illustrator
    or any other vector based application. If you must do it in Photoshop, follow
    the suggestions above.

    knew that.

    for a client. A year from now when they want to change a word or add to the line,
    you will be glad you made that record.
