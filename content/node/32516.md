  I can use it on my mac or PCs...\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what the difference
  is between the normal \"FF Meta OT 1\" collection fontfont sell for $235 bucks or
  the \"FF Meta Pro 1\" they sell for $305 bucks?\r\n\r\nI've noticed with other typefaces
  like Garamond and Garamond Pro, but have never really understood the differences.
  I know I should probably know this, but it's something I have never looked at until
  now... \r\n\r\nThanks for any pointers."

    characters on top of the standard set. So if you need Central European characters
    I would go for the Pro version.\r\n\r\n'FF Meta OT 1' could've easily be called
    'FF Meta Std 1'. Hope this helps."

  body: "The trouble is that every foundry has its own definition of \"Pro\". For
    FontFont it means additional language support -- CE, as Vincent said, but sometimes
    Greek and Cyrillic as well. You can check the PDFs on any OT font page at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=FF%20Meta\">FontShop</a>
    to see what's included.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/virtual/newsletters/nov2006_b/FF-OpenType-Library-2.5.pdf\">FF
    OT Collection brochure</a> includes a handy matrix of language encodings."

    FontFonts include features and characters not found in the legacy formats, so
    they aren't a simple conversion to OT. \r\n\r\nAnd \"Std\" is such a horrible
    name anyway."

    \r\n\r\n<CITE>\r\nBut what exactly makes an OpenType font a Pro font? \r\n\r\nAn
    Adobe OpenType font only gets the Pro designation if it has a minimum base character
    set and a reasonable number of OpenType features. The minimal Pro character set
    includes ISO-Adobe and Adobe CE character sets, plus the euro, litre, foursuperior
    and estimated symbols. \r\n\r\n\r\nCan I call the OpenType fonts I make Pro fonts?
    \r\n\r\nAccording to the OpenType list postings Adobe is not claiming any trademark
    on the Pro designation with reference to OpenType fonts. Although anyone is free
    to use the word, it would reduce end-user confusion if the type community remains
    consistent in their use of the term. \r\n</CITE>\r\n"
