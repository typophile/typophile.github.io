  body: it looks pretty good overall. i agree about the round dots. <BR>they just
    don&#39;t seem natural. <BR> <BR>I think &#34;y&#34; is out of place. everything
    else has a smooth transition, <BR>like the &#34;b&#34; &amp; &#34;p&#34; mentioned
    above, but &#34;y&#34; has that metaesque ink <BR>trap thing where the two stems
    meet. <BR>see <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/5042.html?1044262013"

    <BR>for what i&#39;m talking about. <BR> <BR>&#34;s&#34; and &#34;c&#34; seem
    to be either leaning or shifting off the baseline. <BR> <BR>it may be just my
    monitor, but the bowls of b, d, g, p, and q <BR>seem to be flexing to the inside
    of the glyph.

  body: I like the flavor of this very much. It seem like some of the verticals are
    optically weak compared to the horizontals. See the o, f. Could just be the gif.  <BR>
    <BR>Ok. I really need to get some work done! <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: 'nice heinrich! <BR> <BR>i think you could just make the crossbars on f  <BR>and
    t to actually &#34;cross&#34; the vertical strokes... <BR> <BR>and the dots: they
    should be square and higher.'

  body: '&#62;&#62; i think you could just make the crossbars on f   <BR>and t to
    actually &#34;cross&#34; the vertical strokes...  <BR>  <BR>and/or shorten them
    a bit from the right side. I think that in the instance of the word &#39;voltage&#39;
    which you show, having a bit of a cross-stroke could help with spacing issues?
    maybe. or supply alternates.  <BR> <BR>in the lowercase &#39;r&#39;, where the
    stem and the stroke connect, I think it is a bit thin. maybe? and the lowercase
    &#39;s&#39; seems to be slanting to the left a bit too much as well. <BR> <BR>this
    is really nice. can&#39;t wait to see the uppercase.'
