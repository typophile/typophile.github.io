body: "Good morning.\r\nI'm trying to identify the font used in this seal for \"UNIVERSITY
  COLLEGE LONDON\" and \"CERTIFIED RECORD\". \r\nI already know that the font used
  for \"UCL\" at the center of the logo is ITC Garamond Handtooled Std Bold, so, maybe,
  the other font belongs to the same family. \r\nI have attached a detailed image
  of the seal (sorry for the low-res) and a larger image of the logo placed at the
  center of the seal itself. \r\nCan you help me identify the font or, at least, tell
  me if it most likely belong to the ITC Garamond family?\r\n\r\nThank you very much
  for any help you'll be able to provide.\r\n\r\nAlessandro\r\n\r\n"
