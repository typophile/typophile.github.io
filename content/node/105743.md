  to display spaced out.  IE10 displays ligatures correctly when new and degrades
  after updates. See the problem explained [[http://ahangama.com/liga/|here]]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nMy
  font is a very successful orthographic font. It is the first ever-such font made
  for the writing system of a complex script (Singhala). Users love it because only
  three keys differ on the key layout used for it from the US English keyboard and
  all shifted key positions are intuitive to remember. The first version was finished
  in 2004. \r\n\r\nAt that time, it could be used only in Windows Notepad and SIL.org's
  Worldpad for Windows systems. Apple and Adobe products displayed it with no trouble
  since its inception. It now has 2500 ligatures. (Yes, thousands). This scared people
  like Mozilla who allowed it in normal sizes only inside Thunderbird email client.
  They thought the computer would grind to a halt trying to make thousands of ligatures
  on a web page. This is one of the myths about ligatures. \r\n\r\nBy 2008 Applications
  in Windows, Macintosh and Linux systems showed the font correctly except inside
  Internet Explorer and MS Word. So, I asked the users to use only Safari, Firefox
  and Chrome browsers and AbiWord and Gnumeric as alternatives for Word and Excel.
  (Mozilla later reported that the speed difference between my font and system default
  font is 2%).\r\n\r\nSee a web site using it: [[http://www.lovatasinhala.com|here]].
  Copy some text in it to a text editor and see the underlying Latin text. This is
  really romanized Singhala. Think of it like a Fraktur font but many, many times
  the number of ligatures and shapes gone completely crazy.\r\n\r\nWhen IE9 and MS
  Office 2007 came out, its ligatures showed but weirdly, each ligature was attached
  with a trailing gap.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE BUG\r\nThis week I casually tried
  a test page on my daughter's Notebook and its IE10 showed the test page perfectly.
  I quickly changed programming on that web site to allow IE10 to show the pages in
  the font (earlier I allowed only romanized text). Then I checked the font inside
  Word and the results were still the disappointing spaced-out ligatures. When I opened
  the Font setting dialog, I discovered the bug that has been causing the trouble.
  The preview shows the correctly formed ligatures but the settings never get taken
  by the document.\r\n\r\nNext day I turned on automatic updates on the Notepad and
  the ligatures in IE  changed to ones with gaps after a massing update. The following
  day another update reduced the text down to bare letters with no ligatures at all.
  Surprisingly and happily, Excel 2010 has no problem showing the ligatures!\r\n\r\n[[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/opentype-options-in-the-font-dialog-box-HA101809106.aspx|This]]
  page at Microsoft web site is confusing language and script in its description of
  Standard Ligatures. Could it be that IE and Office developers are  also ambiguous
  about Standard ligatures?\r\n\r\nPlease read the following page where I describe
  the case: \r\n[[http://ahangama.com/liga/|Ligature bug in Word and IE]]"

    body: "Thank you for giving the issue your attention.\r\n\r\nFirst, I want to
      get your mind cleared of any unintentional prejudice you may have. \r\n\r\n<em>Question:</em>\r\nWhy
      do people have freedom to make fonts that represent combinations of Latin characters
      using Fraktur and Gaelic glyphs?\r\n\r\n<em>Possible answers:</em>\r\nThey too
      are 'Latin' shapes; they do not have their own code pages; they are European
      languages; they are not as radically different from generally perceived Latin
      text though Latin Alphabet has only capitals and only 22 letters.\r\n\r\n<em>Here's
      the long answer to your question:</em>\r\nFirst, I cannot personally launch
      another Korean Mess for Singhala. The officials in Sri Lanka are personally
      benefiting from the Unicode Sinhala implementation. I live in US and went back
      there (after 15 years) and found them understandably hardened on opposition.\r\n\r\nThere
      is no earthly reason for Singhala to have its own code page. (May be for ET
      when we annihilate ourselves).  Besides, the benefits of romanizing far, far
      outweighs the lame objections.\r\n\r\nIt is not compatible with Sanskrit and
      Pali because it takes two scipt-ligatures (not font ligatures) as base letters:
      U+0DA5 and U+0DA5. -- This issue completely invalidates the code page. I have
      counted 22 such ligatures. There are three other contracted letter shapes that
      combine iteratively with consonants. \r\n\r\nSinghala is spoken and written
      intermixed with Sanskrit. All Sanskrit words are subject to orthographic ligatures.
      Although you can type some, you cannot do meaningful text processing in it.
      When it comes to complex Sanskrit language ligatures, many cannot be constructed.
      This is like an electric typewriter with dead keys enhanced for the computer
      better functaionality and impossible to use keylayouts. Unicode constrains you
      to its limitations. We are in the digital age! The era of letterpress printing
      is over when we had to adjust to what the lead type limited you to. I was a
      printer 40 years ago ad know this.\r\n\r\nThe consonant shapes shown are not
      of consonants but Consonant plus 'a' vowel. (ka, kha, ga, gha etc.). The grammar
      (vyAkaraNa) tells clearly what is a vowel and what is a consonant and what is
      a phoneme and what is a letter shape. Just because the consonant carries a vowel
      indicater flag on it does not make it a composite letter. (i with a dot is not
      a composite).\r\n\r\nEach vowel, long and short has two code points, one for
      the stand alone shape and another for combining marks ('sign'). This makes text
      processing extremely hard to program if not impossible (I think the latter).
      This is not a language solution, it is for typing.\r\n\r\nCheck out this page
      and see how efficient romanized Singhala is: ( read the JavaScript in the coding):\r\n[[http://www.lovatasinhala.com/restrict/liyanna-e.php|Some
      conversion functions]]\r\n\r\nI have many things done with this. One is this
      project to dig out Pali and Polish form www.metta.lk web site maintained by
      a Danish Buddhist monk. He did a monumental work of digitizing ancient Pali,
      but with hack fonts. You may call my Singhala font one such too but the romanized
      Singhala is the thing that is doing the magic:\r\n[[http://ahangama.com/rs/|Tripitaka
      demo]]\r\n\r\nLast November I discovered moths eating up books in Colombo museum.
      (They did not all0w me to see books in the Archive)."

      want to do such a thing?).\r\n\r\nAll Indian languages have this <em>same</em>
      behavior. Singhala is perhaps the most complex of all of them where the orthography
      is concerned."
