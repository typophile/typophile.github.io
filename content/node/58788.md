body: "Hi, everyone:\r\n\r\nI\u2019m trained as a fine artist in drawing, sculpture,
  and painting, and my husband is trained as a political theorist, researcher, and
  writer. We\u2019ve decided to begin freelance design work together, and we\u2019re
  making a logo to use on our website, business cards, and stationery. Both our initials
  are MM, and we chose to call ourselves M234.\r\n\r\nSome of the qualities we want
  the design to capture that reflect our work:\r\n\r\n\u2014no frills, sometimes complex
  but never cluttered\r\n\u2014a bit playful but restrained\r\n\u2014strong abstract
  components\r\n\u2014we like design solutions that are simple and direct but also
  engaging\r\n\u2014we like discovered shapes and relationships, for example between
  negative and positive space, line intersections, tangencies, etc.\r\n\r\nThe characters
  in the logo are drawn from scratch but based on Neutra (we\u2019ll probably license
  the face). We\u2019ve gone through many variations of our central idea, and we\u2019ve
  narrowed ourselves to these four. We\u2019d appreciate any feedback.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m234_logos_4550.gif]"

  body: "I've posted below #2 again and previous variations with closer cropping.
    We like \"some cropping\" also, but the reason we thought #2 was better than \"some
    cropping\" was that we thought the arrow shape in the upper right corner turned
    out better. But if you like the \"some cropping\" better, can you say why? (We
    don't like the \"more cropping\" at all, but if you have a better suggestion for
    cropping it more, we'd like to see it.) Regardless of the crop, we would want
    to keep the square in the lower right corner.\r\n\r\nPaul, we want the logo to
    stand alone, so we are trying to balance form and abstraction with legibility.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m234-crop-variations_3593.gif]"

  body: I think "2" and "some cropping" look really nice. I would push for "some cropping,"
    because (although I agree that the "arrow" is better in "2") I think that the
    less acute shapes surrounding the top of 2 and bottom of 3 fit better with the
    more solid shapes. They also make the implied overhang of the left stem of M less
    of an outlier.

  body: "well I have to say I see more potential in the last one \"more crop\" I'm
    seeing it being made out of (wood) blocks - a mix of abstract and geometric shapes
    to get the playful and restrained feel you're after.\r\n\r\njust an idea. it's

  body: "I think the \"some cropping\" option works best for the reasons already described.
    But I am concerned that most people who glance at the logo will miss whats going
    on in the negative space. Have you thought of using a color for one or more of
    the shapes created by negative space? I realize it's not good practice to design
    with color, but this type of treatment could be nice in certain situations.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m234-crop-variations_3593_6559.jpg]"

  body: "Paul, with the \"some cropping\" the overall shape is still a solid rectangle.
    We like the simplicity of that. And we definitely will have some applications
    of the logo that use color or texture to emphasize the interior shapes, though
    \"the logo\" on business cards and letterhead will probably be one color, like
    a brickish red.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments, folks. When we have a final version
    we'll post it to show you where we ended up."
