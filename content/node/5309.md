  body: Hmm, actually I think it&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-87-heavy-condensed/testdrive.html?s=ABOUT%a0US%a0FAQs&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Neue Helvetica 87 Heavy Condensed</a>. The one on the bottom would
    be the next lighter weight, Neue Helvetica 77 Bold Condensed.

  body: Mark&#39;s often imitated but never duplicated secret  <BR>success formula
    for identifying typefaces. <BR> <BR>1. Looks carefully. <BR>2. Recognizes. <BR>3.
    Remembers name. <BR>4. Posts name. <BR>5. Goes back to whatever he was doing.
    <BR> <BR>Works like a charm, Paul. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
