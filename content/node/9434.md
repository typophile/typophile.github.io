body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;What do you think are the best
  fonts to use with Cleartype?  I know the canned answer is the Microsoft Reader fonts
  Berling Antiqua, Lucida Sans Typewriter, and Frutiger Linotype.  Berling and Frutiger
  are okay, except the numerals aren&#39;t level height which I can&#39;t stand.  Lucida
  Sans doesn&#39;t do it for me either- would rather use Courier.  So I&#39;d like
  an alternative for my own desktop. <BR> <BR>This Longhorn Frutiger-clone Segoe UI
  looks good.  Don&#39;t understand why its TTF files are so large &#40;330k&#41;.  And
  I see that this Cleartype Font Collection is &#39;coming soon&#39;, but not that
  soon. <BR> <BR>So what do you recommend as a Cleartype-friendly font?  Is there
  a free font out there that works well?  Would it be straightforward for me to alter
  the existing Berling/Frutiger fontfiles to make the numerals evenly spaced and consistent
  height?  Or should I just wait for Longhorn?&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: At Typotechnica, Microsoft gave out a pamphlet on the new typefaces that will
    ship with their new release of Windows. These are especially designed for Cleartype.
    They are a very impressive collection, including John Hudson&#39;s superb Constantia.
    I haven&#39;t seen them on screen, but as they were designed for Cleartype, they
    promise to be a major improvement.

  body: The ClearType team looked at hundreds of fonts when picking fonts for the
    Microsoft Reader &#40;eBook reader&#41; the best available fonts were Berling
    Antiqua and Frutiger.  <BR> <BR>Humanist sans seem to be the best all round for
    this type of rendering - hence Lucida, Myriad, etc., being used elsewhere. But
    these are also the best for b/w and regular antialiasing too - Tahoma, Verdana,
    Prima etc., <BR> <BR>A font is normally large if it has a lot of charaters in
    it. Modifying the Reader fonts would break the EULA. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: 'William, those are the Longhorn fonts. <BR> <BR>Satyen, font files can be
    large if they contain a lot of codepages &#40;especially certain expansive non-Latin
    scripts&#41;. As for modifying, it&#39;s illegal &#40;at least with those fonts&#41;,
    but if it&#39;s for purely internal use I personally say go for it - just make
    sure they don&#39;t end up &#34;floating&#34; onto other people&#39;s drives...
    <BR> <BR>The main question is: What&#39;s it for? Titles, lots of text, or what?
    And are you supposed to embed it in something, or just look at it yourself? <BR>
    <BR>BTW, I remember when I first saw Berling chosen as the main Reader font I
    was disappointed, but then I realized it has more going for it than it seemed.
    <BR> <BR>hhp'

    choices for ClearType. Oh, dear...

    GENERAL area which I thought might get a few more useful eyeballs on it if it
    were here in the BUILD area.
