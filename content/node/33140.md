  about how to set the name. I think i want a traditional no-nonsense sans serif,
  and hoped fellow typophiles might have some ideas or know of suitable boat lettering
  source materials (books, photos etc) \r\n\r\nmany thanks\r\n\r\nEd"

    or what about something funky and with a good backslant: you'd use the regular
    slant cut on the starboard side and the backslant on the port. My fav: http://www.linotype.com/915/kursivschrift-family.html
    _\r\nThat even suits the name I think!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    equivalent The Good Life) or Seas the Day or one of the legions of dopey boat
    names I see (over and over) at the marina by my beach house.

  body: ROFL!  Reminds me of the old Flintstones episode where Fred and Barney buy
    a boat.  Fred wants to call it <em>Nautical Lady</em> and Barney thinks <em>Sea
    Queen</em> would be more appropriate.  They end up compromising with <em>Nau-Sea</em>.  ;-)

  body: Now I'm ROFL. I'm actually not remembering (on purpose I think) some of the
    worst offenders. The marina is basically a trailer park on the water, full of
    fat sunburnt yahoos drinking Bud on the deck of their boat and blaring Ozzie Osborne.
    Meanwhile the most beautiful beach in the world is steps away - they could care
    less.
