    started life as a font and then was distressed and distorted. But I dunno what
    font."

  body: I recall seeing that design (styling) before. I think it started as one of
    those "free fonts" that's based on a movie or TV title... similar to "Twighlight
    Zone" or "Dark Crystal" kinda stuff.
