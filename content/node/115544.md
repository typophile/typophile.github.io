body: I came about a font called Ballardvale, which somewhat looks like Melior or
  Renault. But the font I saw is called Ballardvale medium-condensed, and having searched
  for Google, I saw no results. Could someone give me some information, or hopefully,
  any links to buy the font? Thank you.

  body: You don't say what form you saw the font in -- printed, or an actual font.
    There is a Ballardvale series used by Balfour-Taylor, the giant yearbook publisher
    in the US, although the PDF I found doesn't show a condensed version. There is
    a trainer for Balfour, Hal Schmidt, located in Houston, TX who might shed some
    light on the origin of the font. His email is hal -at- halschmidt dot com

  body: It just a knockoff of Melior. If you want the font, get Melior.

  body: Compugraphic was a US manufacturer of typesetting machines, and in the 1980s
    they copied popular typefaces and sold them as proprietary fonts to use with their
    machines. To avoid lawsuits from the foundries that issued the original fonts,
    Compugraphic gave their copies new names. Palatino became "Palomino," Optima became
    "Oracle," and Frutiger became "Frontiera." Compugraphic's Melior knockoff went
    by several names, one of which was "Ballardvale," named after the street in Wilmington,
    Massachusetts where their headquarters was.

  body: So Ballardvale is just a knockoff.... Last question, you have said that Ballardvale
    was one of the knockoff's name, so what do you think is the final name? Just asking
    to compare....

  body: "The original typeface is [[http://www.linotype.com/1222/Melior-family.html|Melior]],
    designed by Hermann Zapf for the typefoundry D. Stempel AG in Frankfurt in 1952.
    That is way before Compugraphic came up with \u2018Ballardvale\u2019 for [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/|obvious
    reasons]]. The typeface collections of Stempel, Compugraphic and Bitstream all
    went to Monotype. In many cases the Compugraphic and Bitstream knock-offs were
    withdrawn from the market. For obvious reasons, I guess \u2026\r\nOn Luc Devroye\u2019s
    website you\u2019ll find an [[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-38347.html|extensive

    but also Compugraphic, Scangraphic and many others).\r\n\r\nOr what do you mean
    by \u2018final name\u2019?"

    everything on the site is accurate, but it's educational to go though the material.
    \r\nAt least try and purchase fonts from sources that give something back to the

    is not possible.\r\nDon"

  body: Thank you all for your comments. I really appreciate it. I saw the knock-off
    font in a Daily Mail pdf (the British newspaper). It is the name of the front-page
    headline font.

    the fact that <em>revivals</em> exist does not mean that <em>knockoffs</em> cannot
    exist.\r\n\r\nIf one goes back to scans of the <em>Hypnerotomachia Polyphilii</em>
    and then designs a modern trued-up face oneself that captures the essence of what
    Aldus was doing there, that's a revival.\r\n\r\nIf one studies samples of Monotype
    Poliphilus to duplicate that exactly, that's a knockoff. Not that there's as much
    wrong as one might think with knockoffs when they're legal, and especially when
    the law did give some decent protection to typeface designs."
