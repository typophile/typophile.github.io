body: "In the next week I'm trying to track down a copy of PC Professionell, the German
  computer magazine that was redesigned earlier this year by Spiekermann Partners.\r\n\r\nIt
  has a cover that is essentially all text, and I'd like to see how that approach
  plays out in the interior pages.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a U.S. source for specialized
  foreign publications like this? Any of you NYC residents have a favorite bookstore
  that carries this sort of thing? I have colleagues in the Big Apple that could pick
  up a copy if I can point them to the right establishment.\r\n\r\nI am planning to
  contact the publisher directly as well, but I'm concerned about the time/expense
  of shipping it across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help...\r\n\r\nMarc\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pc_professionell_6058.jpg]"

  body: "Oh, I didn't mean to imply that! \r\n\r\nI know firsthand that publications
    redesign for any number of reasons: new editor/art director, new competitor in
    their market space, lagging subscriptions/newsstand sales/ad sales, a desire to
    remain current, editorial repositioning, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes a redesign
    is the last gasp of a dying magazine... "

    they can send you a copy and the last media kit.

  body: "The magazine was discontinued and the staff was fired in June 2007. The title
    cover shown above is that of the last but one issue. In the final issue all members
    of the editorial staff were depicted one by one with private photos and short
    reports saying goodbye to the readers of this magazine which had been published
    for a period of sixteen years. Hearing that they would shut down, I bought the
    final copy out of curiosity, but dumped it later into the dustbin, for it was
    not worth storing it for historial purposes, as there are too many computer mags
    that went broke in recent years.\r\n\r\nA PDF file of the final edition (22 page
    sample, typeset in Minion and Frutiger) is downloadable here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pc-professionell.de/ausgabe/lp/Leseprobe_06-07.pdf\r\n\r\n"

    is FF Unit. The various weights of Frutiger that are listed in the Document Fonts
