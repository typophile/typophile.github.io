    find are these:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/castle/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/salzburg-rr/\r\nBut
    obviously they're not even remotely square enough.\r\nIt's like someone added
    contrast to something like Eurostile."

    the resemblance to your post is just because the letters are not too distinctive
