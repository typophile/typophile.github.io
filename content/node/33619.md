  appears to be (at least) two typefaces.\r\n\r\nBecause if it (not to mention Chalet,
  Lisboa, Eunoia &c.) is just one typeface with variants, then surely Akzidenz Grotesk,
  Helvetica, and Arial are also just one typeface.\r\n\r\nIs there any commonality
  of meaning to the term \"typeface\", or is the matter entirely determined by the
  publisher?\r\n\r\n"

    it is a bit off topic, I found this diagram from Adobe's website strangely amusing.
    It reminds me of the sort of simplifications that occur in Economics--like where
    an nation is assumed to produce only \"guns\" and \"butter\". If Akzidenz Grotesk,
    Helvetica, and Arial are  single typeface I would assume they have less \"Flavor\"
    and more \"Utility.\" \r\n\r\nChalet definitely pushes the limits of what normally
    one would think of as a family, although like Hypatia it is on the frontier. A
    sort of optimum where flavor and utility are maximized.\r\nI don't mean to hijack
    the thread. I think I tend to use the term \"typeface\" more for individual weights,
    and \"family\" for these newer editions with many variants."

  body: like all terms, "typeface" only contains whatever meaning the reader associates
    with it. that said, i usually understand a typeface to be an alphabet embodies
    some idea or concept.

  body: "<strong>From Wikipedia:</strong>\r\n\r\nIn typography, a typeface is a coordinated
    set of glyphs designed with stylistic unity. A typeface usually comprises an alphabet
    of letters, numerals, and punctuation marks; it may also include ideograms and
    symbols, or consist entirely of them, for example, mathematical or map-making
    symbols. The term typeface is often conflated with font, a term which, historically,
    had a number of distinct meanings before the advent of desktop publishing; these
    terms are now effectively synonymous when discussing digital typography. A helpful
    and still valid distinction between font and typeface is a font's status as a
    discrete commodity with legal restrictions, while typeface designates a visual
    appearance or style not immediately reducible to any one foundry's production
    or proprietary control.\r\n\r\nThis concurs with what I was taught in school.
    I suppose that qualifies Hypatia as a typeface.\r\n\r\n"

    pretty much on target. I dislike the first alphabet in Nick's showing, as for
    me the humanist a and g don't go happily with the hooked serifs--and I don't much
    like the a and g anyway. The second line is ok, but I'd much rather have Avenir
    if I wanted to go that way. But the first alphabet, with the a e y replaced with
    the geometric variants--one of the options in the PDF--to me is fresh and interesting,
    and a nice look. \r\n\r\nJust one person's subjective reaction, but I think it
    reflects an unusually  big stylistic variation among alternates. "

    of the options in the PDF\u2014to me is fresh and interesting, and a nice look.</em>\r\n\r\nI'd
    interpret this as illustrating a design feature of the face--that the typographer
    can choose a preference from Stylistic Sets that \"mix and match\" thematic qualities.
    \r\n\r\nA bit like Multiple Masters, except that the type designer defines the
    axes (themes) around which variance occurs -- not using the \"default\" family
    axes of weight, horizontal scaling, and slant. The designer also defines the instances,
    the alternates are not incrementally adjustable. \r\n\r\nOne of Hypatia's axes
    is quite straightforward, which is serifs. There's no fully serifed version, but
    users can vary the amount of semi-serifed characters, as in William's example.\r\n\r\nAnother
    axis, which opposes humanist and geometric letterforms, is a similar kind of concept
    to the Chalet subgenres: general physical qualities like proportion, x-height,
    and stroke weight remain constant, but there are alternate letterforms. \r\n\r\nInstead
    of creating kinship by close physical appearance, these typefaces create family
    through cultural properties, establishing a cultural axis of design which relates
    letterforms of quite disparate appearance. With Chalet it's the high-style aura
    of fashion icon Rene Chalet. With Hypatia, as it says in the promotion, it's a
    1920s/30s state of mind, with Modern and Moderne engaged in a discourse on glamour
    and austerity.\r\n\r\nWell anyway, that's the kind of meaning I thought to find
    in this typeface, suggested by the stylistic sets. Thanks for pointing me in the
    right direction Bill, and thanks for the face of course, Thomas. "

    post-modern take on Hypatia might deconstruct the functionality of formalism,
    asserting that it symbolizes functionality more than actually being functional
    -- so that ironically the Modern version may well be less \"readable\" than the
    Moderne. "
