  body: Enlarging bitmap images doesn't really help in identifying them; the bottom
    three lines are totally illegible.

  body: "The top line might be a De Vinne.\r\nThe \"GO TO LOS ANGELES ....\" might
    be a Runic.\r\nThe rest are probably various Moderns.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I haven't been able to find a match for the top line.\r\n\r\nIt seems to
    me that the matter in the middle is more likely to be a Clarendon than a Modern;
    for example, it might be Antique No. 6.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom, we do have a fat
    and bold version of a Modern; it could be Title No. 2.\r\n\r\nThat is, if one
    is using the Fifteenth Book of Specimens from the Cincinatti Type Foundry.\r\n\r\nThe
    type is all much too old-fashioned for, say, the 1923 ATF specimen book; one does,
    apparently, have to go back to the 19th Century.\r\n\r\nI was suitably astonished,
    though, in coming across Gothic No. 8 on page 217 of the specimen book of the
    MacKellar, Smiths, and Jordan company of Philadelphia for June of 1892.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/future_6563.jpg]"

  body: The title face on the top is a bit similar to Belwe Condensed, in that the
    crossbar on the E is high, and that on the R is low, but it is not a match (the
    crossbar on the E doesn't have serifs in the illustrated face).

  body: "It's definitely not Cheltenham Bold Extra Condensed, because there's no big
    serif on the crossbar of the E. Globe Gothic Condensed has thick and thin strokes,
    but no serifs at all, so it's out as well.\r\n\r\nMiehle Bold Headline is very
    close, but the crossbar in the R is only in the middle of the character, while
    in the example it's significantly below the middle."
