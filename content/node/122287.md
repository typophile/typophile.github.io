  body: "Published in 1789 in Britain. \r\n\r\nCaslon and Baskerville were the type
    designers of the era (give or take a few decades). My money is on the latter,
    given the italic |T| in |GREAT-BRITAIN|.\r\n\r\nThe second volume, published seven
    years later by a different printer, appears to have used the same typeface, but
    I find the title page design to be less interesting:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lwmtitle-163_6032.jpg]"
