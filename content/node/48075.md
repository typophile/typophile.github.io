  body: I'd have a stab at it being [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=GOUDY+MEDium&x=0&y=0&sample_text=WOW|Goudy
    Medium]] based on the 'W' but without a closer shot it's very difficult to be
    certain.

  body: Good call Lex. Where's this stuff from Sarah? Would love to get a closer look
    not just to ID the typeface! Have played with the idea folded business cards a
    few times myself. Nice work!

    provided the link (with more images). Let's not be too critical here, huh? thanks!
