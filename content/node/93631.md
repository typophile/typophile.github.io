  body: I usually pair serif heading with sans body, or vice versa. If you really
    need to go with a serif, how about Caslon?

  body: "Egyptians were originally (early 19th century) the bold for Scotch, which
    makes sense as a pairing, because unless your accompanying serif has high contrast,
    there isn\u2019t suf\uFB01cient distinction between one serif face and the other.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if your display face is a bold Egyptian, you can use just about any serif style
    for body text."

    suites up nice.\r\n\r\nAlso, [[http://www.linotype.com/154410/Laurentian-family.html|Laurentian]],
    from same designer of Slate works well.\r\n\r\nThe mentioned Egyptian is used
    for some bold headlines and uppercase captions.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
