  body: Thank you so much for finding it. However, my client now informs me that the
    50 is not Bickham Script Pro Semibold. I tried Bickham Script Pro Regular but
    it wasnt it either. It would be a big help if someone could find out the font
    of the 50, I have no examples of other characters under that font so I don't even
    know if it's possible to find it.
