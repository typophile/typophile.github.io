  body: "Thirsty script is derivative of Wisdom Script. It is, however, better designed
    and comes in more weights. \r\n\r\nMy understanding is that James Edmondson, designer
    of Wisdom Script, came to an agreement with the Yellow Design Studio people. \r\n\r\nI
    don't think there's any issue here. "

  body: "I'd like to follow up on this a bit.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Design people admitted
    the influence. Mr Edmondson admitted that Thirsty is somewhat of an improvement
    over Wisdom. Wisdom was his first font, and I think he's done with it.\r\n\r\nAs
    a typographer, I'm going to use the best-made font for a project. Should I feel
    ethically compromised about this? In this case, I don't think so, as I believe
    they have struck a royalty agreement."

  body: It was my impression that Yellow was going to keep the font out there regardless,
    which in America, unfortunately, they would have had the legal right to do.  I
    am glad they came to some kind of deal with Edmondson, but its my impression they
    only did so grudgingly after MyFonts threatened to pull the font.

  body: "Looking at the two scripts, it seems to me that while Thirsty Script and
    Wisdom Script both belong to the same general category of scripts, the former
    isn't a copy of the latter; Wisdom Script has the distinctive characteristic of
    being condensed and more squared-off (less rounded) than a conventional script,
    which Thirsty Script avoids.\r\n\r\nAs for the source for those fonts, wouldn't
    it be the same source as gave rise to [[http://www.impallari.com/lobster/|Lobster]],
    or [[http://canadatype.net/fonts/bolero|Bolero]] - although that one is perhaps
    not a fair comparison, being closer to a more generic script - or whatever was
    the source of Dieter Steffmann's Marketing Script, especially. That one reminds
    me of what I had in mind here...\r\n\r\nOr there's Deftone Stylus from Typodermic,
    as well."
