  body: "hey Afonseca, thnx for you're reply\r\n\r\nwhat you suggested works but normally
    i just use my pen tool for this without going trough the trouble of going to contour->close
    contour.\r\n\r\nwhen i want to connect my last point to my first point normally
    there appears this little circle on my start point, i click it et voila...i get
    a closed path...just like in say illustrator...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A few things: \r\n\u2022This only works with the \u201CDrawing\u201D pen
    tool. The others require you to manually close the path. Probably because they
    aren\u2019t meant for drawing complete shapes.\r\n\u2022Zoom in a little more
    and make sure that you\u2019re clicking right on the point. The cursor will have
    a circle over it when positioned to close the path. \r\n\u2022Sometimes closing
    paths just doesn\u2019t work right and you just have to keep moving the points
    over each other again and again until it works."

  body: Also... if its not closing turn on font audit and it will give you a fix arrow
    where the 2 points are. I use a wacom intuos tablet as well and the sensitivity
    levels for FontLab can be a bit wacky at times.

  body: "hey thnx for all the replys people, i really appreciate it, but here's the
    thing...the circle that should appear when the cursor is positioned to close the
    path just doesn't show up all i keep getting is the \"+\" no \"\xB0\"\r\n\r\ni'm
    using the \"drawing\" pen tool and zoomed in as close as possible...i'm sure i
    positioned the cursor right on the point since the \"+\"keeps appearing ive tryed
    it a hundred times but no luck\r\n\r\nwhen fontaudit is on i get \"contour looks
    to be closed but is marked as open,close the contour or click fix\"\r\n\r\nofcourse
    when i click fix it closes the contour but thats the only way possible to close
    the contour at the moment...no way possible to do this with the drawing pen tool
    and it should..."
