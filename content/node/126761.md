  to get help and learn from members who are certainly more knowledgeable and have
  more experience than me in setting typography.\r\nI love humanist typefaces and
  want to use Robert Slimbach's revival distributed as Adobe Jenson. As you all know,
  it provides optical sizes ranging from caption do display as well as different weights
  from light to bold. What I am trying to achieve is a correct type color on the page.
  Jenson regular is too aggressive and lack elegance while Jenson light is too anemic
  (but has elegance). I want to know how to strike a balance between these two extremes
  and get a weight that is between the light and regular. I know editing software
  such as fontographer provide such tools but don't know how to proceed artfully (which
  I know takes a lifetime). It seems to me that choosing an em size in fontographer
  by simply clicking on \"change weight\" is not all there is to it. \r\n\r\nSo could
  a generous soul guide me on this path to achieving music for the eyes. (This could
  be references to books, websites, tutorials, suggestions, advice, etc.)\r\n\r\nI
  recently discovered the I Tatti Renaissance Library series published by Harvard.
  I thinks that its design, beautifully orchestred by Dean Bornstein of Perpetua Press,
  interprets quiet elegantly the Renaissance period. He used Adobe Jenson and definitely
  changed the weight of the typeface but I think it still remains too thin, especially
  the italics. Do you think he made Adobe Jenson light weightier or Adobe Jenson Regular
  thinner ? How do you proceed in doing this?\r\nHere's a sample page from the series:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theperpetuapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/itatti-text.jpg\r\n\r\nAnd
  here are two links for more information on the design:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theperpetuapress.com/?p=223\r\nhttp://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/itatti/about-book-design.html\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm a freelance book designer/layout artist of over 26 years' and 100 books'
    experience. NEVER fuck around with a typeface's weight yourself. It's prob'ly
    not okay with the EULA. But it's also not the type designer's vision. Design your
    own face if you have a better idea. That said, I know what you mean about some
    typefaces making for a darker page than you'd like. But that's a design issue
    that you, as the book and page designer are supposed to be able to dope out. I
    work it out with generous leading, which I tend to favor anyway. I would look
    at 11/16. If that's way beyond what you've ever used and seems crazy, try 15.5
    pt or 15 pt leading. I think I've actually used Adobe Jenson Regular as body text
    on a book within the last coupla years to good effect. But, again, the generous
    leading made it work. The Light over the course of 200 or more pages strts to
    look insubstantial, I think. Of course, this is only my experience and my taste.

  body: "Hi Parangon, I'm curious whether you're rendering these judgements of the
    typeface's character by looking at it on a screen or printing it on paper \u2014\_often
    a typeface will feel more aggressive or more elegant when it's ink on paper, rather
    than pixels on a screen. This goes for the type of ink and type of paper, too;
    cheaper paper creates more ink spread, while in a laser print the ink sort of
    sits on top of the page.\r\n\r\nI bet it's possible (probable, in fact) that the
    Tatti Renaissance Library books you admire so much use an out-of-the-box weight
    of Jenson, but that the particular paper and ink being used make it appear different
    than it does in whatever medium you're currently looking at it.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Nevermind,
    just read the design info, which says the books use a custom typeface based on
    Jenson (not Adobe Jenson, mind you, but rather the historical model of Jenson
    itself) \u2014 curious that it doesn't name the type designer."

  body: "Hi \u201CParangon,\u201D\r\n\r\nSo, the nice thing about the Adobe EULA is
    that, unless something has changed since I last checked, it allows modifications
    for internal use.\r\n\r\nA similarly nice thing from your POV about the Adobe
    type design process is, most of the typefaces with varying weights were designed
    using an axis-based approach like Multiple Master or Variations. So the odds are
    extremely high that you could glue together the light and the regular weights
    of Adobe Jenson in an axis-based space, and interpolate and get something perfectly
    usable, because that's pretty much how they were designed in the first place!
    Maybe a few glyphs would need to be fixed, is all (as Adobe does an auto-clean-up
    after interpolation, which could damage the interpolability of some glyphs).\r\n\r\nYou
    could even do a custom optical size at the same time, to match your most common
    point size of body text in your book(s).\r\n\r\nMy normal approach would be to
    create the two axes and find the ideal instance, and export that as a stand-alone
    font, and then try it. Get a different instance if your tests show you need more
    or less weight, etc. I have done this a fair number of times in the past. Of course,
    as CEO of FontLab and former product manager for fonts at Adobe, I am pretty familiar
    with all the moving parts in this equation, so I know what glitches to look out
    for."
