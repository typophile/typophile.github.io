  Of course, i'm not looking for \"Ten Awesome Free Fonts\". I pay good money. Or
  rather, my customer hopefully does. \r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nalex"

    I think, because it is hardly hidden. And those are only available from free (and/or
    open, public, whatever) sources. I've heard of \"naked\" embedding of the recent
    FontShop Axel release, which is corroborated by <a href=\"http://webfonts.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fonts_available_for_%40font-face_embedding\">the
    webfonts.info wiki</a> (which gets its info from <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/last-hours-for-the-axel-promotion/\">this
    post on the FontFeed</a>), so that looks good. Otherwise, the only list I know
    of <em>is</em> that one on the webfonts wiki. Start there, or wait for the guys
    who've actually read all the recent EULA-updates from the big foundries, if any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014

    C\xFAfon is akin to sIFR, where a \"raw\" font is converted to another format
    and then linked from a webpage. So that's different from linking directly to a
    \"naked\"/\"raw\" font.\r\n\r\nC\xFAfon (and sIFR) cannot be used on the desktop,
    for example, so I can easily see licenses allowing those \"embedding\" solutions
    but at the same time disallowing direct linking to \"raw\" fonts."

    that there are any commercial font licenses that explicitly allow Cufon. Licenses
    that allow SiFR embedding might also allow to Cufon; ask the vendor to find out."
