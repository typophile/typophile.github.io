body: This was scanned off an old business card (poorly, I might add) but my client
  has no idea what it is, and we're updating all of their stuff to electronic files.
  This guy actually had stat shots of other stuff for his place. In 2010??? If anyone
  knows what it is, or can get me close, I'll be mighty obliged!
