  body: 'Yes, thank you, very close! Altough, the bumps on Pilot Point are a little
    bit exaggerated compared to the font in the image. If I were to use a font that
    was close and not exact, I think I''d use something slightly more toned down.
    I don''t agree with the original font choice, the guy is a dump truck renter,
    not a Wild West theme park. '

    thought Broadgauge was most similar, but all had spurs of some kind on the end
