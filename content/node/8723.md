  body: The calligrapher won&#39;t work vertically and isn&#39;t interested in going
    to the boat and applying the name, apparently. <BR> <BR>I may just hit the phone
    book or the AIGA but I was hoping some of the folks here had worked with journeymen/women
    letterers in the area who might want a bit of work, being that it&#39;s their
    down season now.

  body: How about making a stencil from the artwork? Maybe there any other non-vinyl
    transfer methods you could use? How about a huge rubber stamp? ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Si

  body: actually, we have done a bit of vinyl stencilling here. I t is easy, just
    get the design cut out, apply the vinyl, then roller-paint the design. Let it
    dry and pull away the vinyl. Cheap and really easy. You could probably do it yourself.
    Vinyl makes a terrific mask.

  body: Hmm. Never thought of that. I assume that special paints and sealants are
    used for nautical purposes - anyone done anything like that? I might be able to
    apply it myself, but I think the client is going to pick something to be applied
    in gold with a black undercoat/drop on it, and from what I understand this sort
    of work is usually applied by hand using a kind of enamel.
