  remember visiting a site that documented design studio interiors?\r\n\r\nI think
  it was like a blog or searchable database you could go to. Each day, the managing
  editors would post pictures of new spaces (about 5-7 photos per post) and you could
  look through them for ideas, inspiration, or just to see what it was like for other
  people working in different parts of the world.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I'm
  talking about? Ever visited and if so, do you still have the URL?\r\n\r\nThanks!
  Again, sorry if this is a little out of character.\r\n\r\n-Andy"
