<div class=commentbody>Well see, that's a little bit of dilemma - in researching here - I'm trying to figure out - out of all bibles - new testament, old, king george and manuscripts what's going to be the most recognizably "bible" but not definately not display faces because I don't want to take away from the creative (an image on every page) that I was going to lay out as if they were the illumination, woodcut illio , ect. <br> <br>Considering too - this is being distributed to a bunch of designers - I think I gotta get the fonts right - or at least a good choice. body text is my major problem. Was thinking of going with unicals, somewhere in there, what do you think? <br> <br>haha - I was wondering if someone was gonna mention the steelplate gothic - was thinking it would be nice for tiny footers & folio. <br> <br>any idea as to what faces you'd think of for a bible would be great</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Font decision depends on what kind of feeling you <br>want to associate with "bible". <br>Do you want to evoke a historic feeling, showing <br>"bible" as a medieval, old traditional thing? <br> <br>Or do you want to evoke it as a word that <br>accompanies you? A daily lecture? <br> <br>Then: do you want to show "bible" as the great <br>heavy words that hurt - or as gentle, convincing <br>words that can accompany life? <br> <br>For the both second ways (accompaning and gentle) <br>Kurt Weidemann created a font, in the first place <br>especially for a new print of the bible. First its <br>name should be Biblia. Now its called ITC <br>Weidemann. Its legible and economic. <br> <br>I personally wouldn't take uncials. They evoke much more feelings than "bible" for example too old, not relevant for today ... <br>I think in tradition the best forms of holy <br>scriptures were produced, when people worked out <br>there own time and feeling in fonts. <br>And with every font they produced things that have the unique look of "bible". <br> <br>As I'm a protestant pastor (half of my time, in the rest I'm typophile) <br>maybe I could help with some examples. <br> <br>What's the theme of the book? <br> <br>Michael</div>

<div class=commentbody>trying to find bibles to look it does seem to be my problem John - I've been going round the city sneaking into churches (some still have open doors) but all I get are Psalms & proverb books. Searching online isin't very helpful in trying to get a sense of the faces - well unless I'm going to order them and wait 2 weeks. <br> <br>I manage to find a copy of the New Testament but its produced by the Canadian Gideons for 1986. Not very bible-y looking. Which is why I'm asking here, hoping a survey of ideas , venues and titles might solve the quintecential bible "look" from worldly typophiles. <br> <br>Weidemann sounds familiar - thanks. I guess that is what I'm looking for - I had thought that there were a slew of fonts that must have been created specifically for typesetting bibles. <br> <br>Micheal: the book is a complete listing and viewing of the winners from our areas Advertising and Design Association awards, So cover is important (but I got that done) its black, vertical and horizontal lines reading Advertising and Design....crossed with 2003 Awards" layed out tiny tiny in the upper right hand corner in white. The book will be perfect bound - the cover resembling leather (but fake, no budget here) the inside pages to be 2 columns I'm thinking with that vertical rule in the gutter. the Left side page on spreads will have an image of the piece - the right side text - 1 major dropcap, first line indents on paras. At least this is what I can drum up so far. <br> <br>I don't think I want medieval - just classic enough. Its going on superwhite Mead silk paper - so I'm not going to fake a traditional bible that technically should be on yellowing pages. <br> <br>I'm searching out those bibles you mentioned - thanks John. Hopefully I can find text pages in google</div>

<div class=commentbody>The relatively recent Schocken Bible I: The Five Books of Moses, published by Random House uses Dante, which according to Bringhurst, I believe, has specially designed drop caps - which is maybe why the designer used it. <br> <br>Haarlemmer was designed originally as a bible type. </div>

<div class=commentbody>19th century Bibles tended to be more distinctive from other books than most recent Bibles. Apart from the obvious two-column format, many utilised rules extensively, effectively chopping the page into sections in a very visible way. This is something you might consider. <br> <br>I recommend going into any decent bookshop and trying to find a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0714837741/qid=1053292054/sr=1-34/ref=sr_1_34/103-3222240-2696624?v=glance&s=books">this recent book</a>, which is a history of the Bible as a physical object.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tanya, <br> <br>The Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch sold by Linotype is a larger optical size. Digital versions of the smaller sizes are available from <a href=http://www.romana-hamburg.de>Helzel</a> and <a href=http://www.fraktur.de>FVL</a>. It looks best when the user takes full advantage of the long s, ligatures, and alternate width forms. <br> <br>Both Wilhelm Klingspor-Schrift and Maximilian (also available from Helzel and FVL) were designed by Koch for Bible typesetting.</div>

The word of god means labor and work, you are small - what you read is great. <br>You can read only part by part, lots of numbers separate the text. And passages that should impress you most are printed in bold. <br>A whole different approach is Caflischs bible: <br>Take it and read, without sacred respect. So I can experience itself: the powerful prosa of creation or Job, the music of the psalms, the criminal stories in the old testament, the difficult letters of st.paul, the stories of the gospels. <br>All that is literature - very good literature. <br>By this layout I can view myself - apart from my education and the advice of others. The text is readable as a novel - without disturbing numbers and links. Those are set in the margin. And no headlines and bold sentences tear the language apart (and don't disturb the rhythm of speech.) <br>This way layout serves the word. <br> <br></div>

You see suddenly, now that the client and I came to this idea, all this quick research and comp'ing it out (over the weekend I might ad), I went back to the firm and mentioned what had come to the bosses. Over the past few days I've had to kick and scream justifying the look and feel, which the client has already agreed to! my art director has said no. he thinks the entire idea is blasphemus. grrr <br>was I that wrong?

<div class=commentbody>Is aping the design of Bibles blasphemous? I think one would need to ask a qualified religious authority, not an art director. Personally, I think it likely depends on the content for which you are designing: if you were producing a catalogue for hardcore porn videos, then I think it would be blasphemous in that it deliberately associates the imagery of sacred text with the scandalous and profane. Of course, the content of an awards book is still technically profane, but it probably isn't scandalous. Note that I'm using scandalous in its theological sense, i.e. something that encourages sin in others or knowingly creates the opportunity for sin.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with John (as I do with his position in the war/peace-thread - very good and important) <br>As a theologian and pastor I'm (normally) very aware of blasphemian content (and there is a lot of hidden blasphemy in ads, and a lot of things I don't agree with and don't like, as there is blasphemy in political, economical positions and sometimes even in positions of churches as history shows). <br>If I have had any suspicion of blasphemy I wouldn't have contributed anything here. <br> <br>I see it as harmless aping. Maybe even - if it's well designed - it recalls a sense for biblical word as a good side effect. <br>In the bible itself you can find lists of people, families, soldiers, even lists of payment (and lists of sin and sinners ;-) ) and so on, because the bible (in the old testament) keeps track and memory of people - a sign of care. In this sense I can agree with the bible design - some sign of difference, ironical modification provided. And the last points I think can be seen in thee outter form and the context in which the book appears. <br> <br>On the other hand: The use of the cross on the cover could - if I think twice - bother me a little. Could it be that religious importance is applied to design and advertising ?* I for example don't like books named as "bible" if they aren't - excepted if it's clearly ironic - for example I dislike "The Macintosh Bible", "The Windows Bible" and so on, because the content is not worthy of such high word as "bible" and computers shouldnt get that respect. <br>For me that spot of bothering would immediately disappear, if the text on the cover wouldn't form a cross. With black/white, the position and so on there is enough reference to the bible-look to keep that concept. And there is no problem for me in the design of the inside pages. <br> <br> <br>* Perhaps I should say it this way: It is a problem of the direction of sense/meaning. The aping of religious design isn't blasphemic and I don't have any problem/bothering with it (except of sometimes tasteless things you can see). Religion itself and its design should have enough power to stand that and there is no need to be strict. Sometimes even it is good and prophetic to ape forms - for rethinking and changing them. (a sideway thought of me: that black design of bibles for example with the strict white line-cross does'nt show the liveliness of the word inside, see for better the rich and joyful design of old bible manuscripts) <br>But if - in the other direction - profane things are raised to religious importance that's indeed problematic. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>re: aping Bible design... <br> <br>Ask yourself, would you consider making your project look like the Qu'ran or the Talmud? Apply that answer to whether or not you should make something look like a Bible.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think the same rules apply to the bible and the qu'ran or talmud. Because since we realised the separation between church and state, we gained the right to make fun, to ridiculize, to do the worse blasphemy things upon christiannity. It isn't the same at all about Judaism, or Islam, and i don't think comparing them in the idea to consider and treat them in the same way makes sense. <br>And blasphemy is only such if the person who do it is religious. Someone not believing in the holiyness of something doesn't make a blasphemy, it's only logical.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think making fun on christiannity is a lack of respect. That religion is a part of our culture, being a believer or not, and it should be possible to deal with it as we do with every part of that culture. <br>I guess a real christian shouldn't care that kind of things. <br>As for me, i'm not a believer but i have the bigger respect for the ones who are, and for religion itself; i love religious texts. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>It isn't the same at all about Judaism, or Islam... Someone not believing in the holiyness of something doesn't make a blasphemy, it's only logical. <br> <br>I don't think the religion make any difference. It is a question of taste and manners. The fact that we are free to disrespect others' beliefs doesn't mean we should do it. <br> <br>We can criticise or dismiss the beliefs of all three religions without insulting their believers. <br> <br>I am not a Christian, but I think using the Cross in a mocking or silly way is in poor taste, including the example in this thread. <br> <br>The issue is using symbols that are sacred to some in a way that negates their sacred symbolism. There may be a legitimate place for that by, for example, a person offended by the practices of the religion they grew up in. But to do so lightly, whether you are an insider or outsider I think shows a lack of taste and good manners. <br> <br>I think that the 'Macintosh Bible' etc are fine, and using the 2-column format etc. are no problem, because there is no claim of sacredness or abusing sacred symbols. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>If someone mocks something in a way that others might not deem respectful, then you are at risk of insulting those others. Even if those others aren't your market, and maybe they won't even see what you are creating. -- I agree with John's comment about content. <br></div>
