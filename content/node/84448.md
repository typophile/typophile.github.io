  body: "Great and very interesting! ... Last I seen anything like this from an ancient
    manuscript (but I forget where). But I remember my grandfather ever taught it
    to me :-) ... I am very fluent in reading the Arabic Koran, but it does not, LoL\r\n\r\nIn
    Indonesia, it can be said to be almost extinct. No longer the wearer, but if not
    wrong I think it was still used in Malaysia. This is a form of acculturation of
    the Arab-Malays in the early spread of Islam in Asia\r\n\r\nBest regards"
