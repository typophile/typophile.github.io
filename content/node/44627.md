body: "We're at a point as foundries that sell fonts primarily where it's reasonable
  to only offer OpenType PS fonts for download to customers but there are some that
  say we must also include TrueType as well since so many older apps don't support
  loading OT fonts so, faced with the prospect of updating my entire library in OT,
  do I cover all bases and include OpenType PS, Mac/Win PS, and Mac/Win TT for the
  respective buyers? Do I only over OpenType PS? Do I offer OpenType PS AND Mac/Win
  TT?\r\n\r\nThe problem is, if I only offer OpenType PS, I'm likely to get e-mails
  from customers who can't use this format BUT if I offer all three I'm likely to
  get the same amount of folks who think nothing of dragging and dropping a single
  folder with all three font formats into Suitcase and none of 'em working so I'm
  trying to mitigate the difference.\r\n\r\nI'd like as many different perspectives
  on this as the group can muster so please share this thread around because I don't
  feel I'm the first foundry to have this concern.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nStuart :D"

    have the luxury of not having any \"baggage\" in that I started fresh without
    any previously made fonts...\r\n\r\nAs my speciality is multilingual fonts I needed
    Unicode support, so Postscript was out of the question. Yay!\r\n\r\nAt first I
    though about only offering OpenType PS (the \"professional\" format of choice
    ;), but soon decided that this would leave out too many customers - you need TrueTypes
    for \"Office\" users (especially Powerpoint is finicky with fonts ;)\r\n\r\nFinally
    I decided to sell the the two formats separately - to prevent customers from installing
    both formats on the same computer and ending up with conflicts.\r\n\r\nAn added
    bonus is that both formats can be used on both Mac & Windows...\r\n\r\nSo far
    it has worked out fine.\r\n:)\r\n\r\nRoger"

  body: "Well, I think old Type1 and old TT formats are mostly obsolete.\r\nHowever,
    I'd offer both PS and TT flavour OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nI have already experienced
    in some apps, which with some other fonts worked with either, for one specific
    font they'd accept only the TT-flavour OT font. That is, they were fine on screen,
    both could be used, but when printing, the PS-flavour OT font was messed up.\r\n\r\nI
    have never found out why. Other PS-flavour OTs worked well."

  body: "My present plan for future releases is to offer a basic .ttf font (with Latin
    Extended encoding) at low cost, and a full-featured .otf at higher price.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a way of tagging different product versions without giving them different names\r\n\r\nThe
    .ttf fonts aren't strictly speaking OpenType, but the difference is moot, as many
    .otf fonts don't have OpenType features!\r\n\r\n(When OS X was introduced, with
    functionality for Windows TrueType fonts, the benefit of OpenType in providing
    cross-platform compatability was considerably lessened; subsequently, the benefit
    of OpenType has come to be more associated with substitution features.)"

    said, the question remains, if the OpenType font contains alternates and ligatures,
    as a courtesy do we need to offer the basic TrueType folks these extra glyphs
    in the form of an alternate font where they live in the roman slots or do we say,
    sorry, upgrade and you'll see the features in the OT version?\r\n\r\nStuart\r\n\r\nPS:
    I agree with you Nick that OpenType of itself is now a non-feature but it's been
    well marketed to convince folks if they aren't using OT fonts they are dinosaurs
    and so all fonts that aren't OT are also dinosaurs . . ."

    (i.e.99.99%+) of the users who own a computer and have internet access (so that
    they can buy your fonts online/download them) will have software that works fine
    with OT, so no need for 256-character fonts there.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for
    those users that live in the other part of the world and where probably still
    most, but by no means that high percentage has OT-aware swoftware, you Latin-1
    encoded 8-bit font won't provide the necessary characters. Basically then you'd
    have to start building fonts for every arcane 8-bit encoding. No?\r\n\r\nJust

  body: "I'm just wondering about the same at the moment.\r\n\r\nAnother point to
    consider: if you are selling opentype fonts: do you use encoded or unencoded \"special\"
    glyphs (like Smallcaps, alternate figures, ligatures, etc.)?\r\nFor really opentype-savvy
    applications, no encoding may be better (no chaos with manually inserted characters
    and changing fonts), but for everything else, which may support unicode, but almost
    no typographic features, it would be better to encode this characters to make
    them available at all...\r\n\r\nDo you just decide which may be better for most
    of the customers?\r\nOr do you provide two different versions?"

    because of the OpenType-unaware programs. Those people, who have OpenType features-capable
    programs AND know about OpenType features  and how to activate them won't insert
    those glyphs manually any way. For all the other people, I think, it is unethical
    to barr access to the glyphs they have paid for.\r\n\r\nIt's not our job to *enforce*
    properly encoded text."
