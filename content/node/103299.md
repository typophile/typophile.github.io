  hand-lettering?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buergermeister_4168.png]\r\n\r\nI
  might be tempted to make a font of it once I get Maestrale and Numina out."

  body: All repeating characters are exactly the same, so I would go with font; unfortunately,
    with all of the do-it-yourself-from-your-own-handwriting fonts out there, I haven't
    a clue as to which font it is...

    really a font).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
