  the designer, picked Novarese Stop for the logo of his earlier company, Sequential
  Circuits, and now uses Mistral for Dave Smith Instruments. Uurrghhh. \r\nThis is
  from a photo of a Poly Evolver:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poly Evolver
  Logo_3550.jpg]\r\nAnd this is someone's copy:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo
