body: I haven't found an efficient way to delete a single segment between two nodes.
  Is there a way to do it in one step?

  body: "You can click on the segment between the two points and hit 'delete.' \r\n\r\nThis
    leaves the points in tact, while removing the connecting segment. The result is
    an open contour.\r\n\r\nTo do this you have to set the preference: Glyph Window
    < Advanced < Edit/Delete command breaks contour\r\n\r\nHope that's helpful!\r\n\r\nj[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pref_6390.png]"

    I modification I found convenient is to make control-Q the short cut for fitting
    the glyph in the window. "

  body: 'Control-6 goes to 200% zoom, at least on a PC. I don''t think they had a
    short cut for ''fit'' until I put one, but I may have forgotten, and something
    less convenient was there. If you go to Help/keyboard short cuts, everything is
    listed. No, control-Q doesn''t quit in FontLab. '

  body: 'Yes, control-0 does do it on the PC. I don''t know whether that was documented,
    as a lot of stuff was missed, as discussed in other threads. Being left-handed,
    I find control-Q more natural, so I may have set it up for that reason; it is
    more or less a left-handed version of control-0.  '

  body: "True, if you make the adjustments. I was just saying that technically, there's
    nothing wrong with Control-Q on the Mac. I would never make the assignment myself,
    for fear of accidentally hitting Cmd-Q instead. \r\n\r\nI had enough problems
    with an editor that toggled the main document to the front via Cmd-1, which is
    right in line with Cmd-Q. I can't tell you how many times I went to bring the
    master document to the front, and quit the whole project. I did get lots of practice
    stringing together curse words!"
