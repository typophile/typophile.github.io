body: "An interesting conversation popped up recently in our group about super-scripting
  the Trade, Service and Registered marks. \r\n\r\nThe context is specifically web,
  but we wanted to apply any tried and true typography rules to our decisions and
  then realized we didn't necessarily have any tried and true typography rules that
  apply to this handy.\r\n\r\nAre there any?\r\n\r\nMore specifically, we're interested
  in the use of them in headlines. It occurred to me that I never see those marks
  in newspaper headlines. I'm assuming there's perhaps an AP style guide that references
  this issue but haven't had much luck via google finding that yet. "

    \xAE glyphs. Don\u2019t try to do anything special with them on the Web, save
    perhaps for headlines you know will be large.\r\n\r\nI think it is generally accepted
    that, at display sizes in print, such glyphs should be manually shrunk to tiny
    size."

  body: "In HTML, we're aiming for the actual \u2122 and \xAE glyphs. I've found the
    \u2120 glyph to be inconsistent across browsers and fonts, though.\r\n\r\nAs you
    can see the registered glyph differs from the TM glyph in that it's not super
    scripted by default. So we manually created some classes for each that end up
    optically adjust them to be relatively the same.\r\n\r\nThe complaint is, indeed,
    that people feel they are too large in display sizes (we've optically adjusted
    them to be roughly 50% the cap-height aligned to the cap-height which looks fine
    as body text, but does tend to be a bit large in display settings). I don't necessarily
    disagree but feel that the optimum solution is to not even use them in display
    sizes (as newspapers seem to agree on). I was hoping to perhaps find some established
    style rule that the press uses. "

    simply...don't. And minimize the use of same in body copy, as well. A footnote
    on the home page stating that \"OurCompany\" is a Registered Trademark of OurCompany,
    Unltd. or whatever will suffice."

    what OldNick said: place a general declaration of trademarks at the footer or

    However they're a good idea in newspaper ads or promotional pieces. Or if the
    newspaper mentions a trademark that they own themselves. But when simply reporting
    the news, they aren't needed.\r\n\r\n> In printed promotion, it is also common

    instance on each page, rather than just the first instance in the publication.
    But this isn't a legal requirement.\r\n\r\n"
