    were deemed a failure and were never used again. There are no submission templates
    for the TDC Type design competition."

  body: James, it would be interesting to see them, from an historical perspective,
    if they still exist in some form. I must have seen them at the time, but don't
    recall them. I do recall the complaints, which seemed to be mostly about the lack
    of creative freedom they imposed, rather than about the actual design of the templates.

    around the tdc.org website somewhere?  I can still find many previous \"call for
    entry\"s there.\r\n\r\n(BTW, I'm not planning on entering the competition any
    time soon, or using these templates when/if I do so.)\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Why, specifically, were they viewed as failures?</cite>\r\n\r\nNone
    of the entrants liked them, the judges hated them, and we quickly realized allowing
    submissions to be fine-tuned by those entering would provide a better result.\r\n\r\n<cite>Might
    they be floating around the tdc.org website somewhere?</cite>\r\nThe first competition
    was held before the TDC had a web site. The templates may be floating around,
    but not on the web site.\r\n\r\nEssentially the templates were made up of different
    sizes of text blocks on a 11 x 17 portrait page. For text submissions I think
    it went from 6 point up to 24 or so. For display entries it might have had a range
    of 14 to 96. With a character showing at the bottom. And a pangram headline at
    the top."

    There was another for display that I cannot find. This one was printed on the
