body: "There are many variations of how the c in last names starting with \"Mc\" (like
  my own, McArthur) have been used in handwriting and in type. I have seen a raised
  c such that the top of the c lines up with the capital letters on either side of
  it, a raised c with a horizontal line under it, a raised c with two dots under it,
  a raised c with two horizontal lines under it (the way I was taught when I was little),
  and a raised c with a horizontal line under it and two dots under the line. The
  lines and dots seem to be most common in handwriting, but I have seen the c raised
  frequently in type, and have also seen it in type with underlines sometimes. Nowadays
  it is obviously common to use a normal lowercase c, with or without an apostrophe
  between the M and the c.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know of any Unicode characters that
  would match any of the raised variants? Does anybody have some insight into which
  variant(s) may be most correct?"

    Mac literally meaning 'son'. It is normally taken to mean 'son of' \u2013 Mac
    Arthur, for example, meaning Son of Arthur.\r\n\r\nBeing Irish, I have never seen
    Mc with an apostrophe between the two letters. I would say that the most correct
    way of writing it, taking its history into account, is simply 'Mc', without any
    dots, lines or otherwise.\r\n\r\nRoss"

    semi-standard probably encodes characters like that somewhere in the Unicode PUA.\r\n\u2014Joel"

  body: "I also learned to print my name with a raised c. Can't remember if there
    was a line under it or not, but I think not. It was done that way on the family
    business signage, and occasionally I have seen it with a little triangle instead.
    Never double underlines though.\r\n\r\nSince adopting the typewriter in 1970 as
    a cure for horrid handwriting and printing, and later the computer, I have given
    up on the raised c and let it slide back to the baseline. It does not bother me
    down there."

  body: Thanks for the responses guys. I guess I will abandon my efforts for now and
    settle for a baseline c, but I will keep my eyes open.

  body: "Just because it isn't in Unicode doesn't mean it can't be in a font. Small
    caps aren't encoded in Unicode, either. If using an appropriate application that
    supports such things, you could use an OpenType font that has superiors or ordinals
    (and adjust their vertical position if needed).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

    with a raised c. I don't think it matters and believe its just a matter of personal
    preference.
