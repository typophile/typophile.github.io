  to convert tracking between QuarkXpress and InDesign. Thanks much in advance!\r\n\r\n(ps.
  I did find that 200 of QXP is 1000 of InD, hence 1 of QXP is 5 of InD. But I don't
  know how to read \"+3/100\".)"

  body: Would 3/100 = 30/1000? Indesign measures this in thousandths of an em. 3 percent
    equals 30 per mille. MAybe this is the conversion you need?
