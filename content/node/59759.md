body: "I have checked various threads here, and read Thomas Phinney's recent Font/Typeface
  Survey results. All have been helpful. However, please share your ideas about what
  words might be used in critical and historical discussions the printed/displayed
  result of type?\r\nI make a distinction between type \u2014 the vehicle \u2013 and
  letter \u2013 the result. I know that this sounds nit-picky but in various historical
  and critical texts I have encountered different versions of the same words. \r\nSome
  examples of the problem: \r\nWhich is preferred; letter form, letter-form, letterform?
  \r\nAnd does \"letter shape\" have a different meaning?\r\nHow about grapheme and
  glyph?\r\nA generic word for hand-written letters is script, which is also a stylistic
  category--and by the way printed currency.\r\nCan character be fairly applied to
  both the element of type and the image it produces?\r\nOr do you just have to carefully
  define your terms at the head of the discourse?\r\nAny thoughts will help."
