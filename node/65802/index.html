<p>Stationer:</p>
<p>The original, old fashioned &ldquo;stationer&rdquo; goes back before the incunabula, I believe; these were middlemen who sold and controlled the binding of manuscripts into books for sale. &ldquo;In 1403, the Corporation of London approved the formation of a Guild of stationers. At this time, stationers were either booksellers, illuminators, or bookbinders[1]. Booksellers sold manuscript books that they or their employees had copied. They also sold the writing materials that they used. Illuminators illustrated and decorated manuscripts.</p>
<p>Printing gradually displaced manuscript production and, by the time that the Guild received a royal charter of incorporation on May 4, 1557&hellip;&quot;—http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers</p>
<p>More recently (1830-ish, rise of the middle class, industrial revolution and invention of department stores, window displays and marketing devices such as pre-packaged sets of stuffs like paper with envelopes) the old fashioned stationer was to whom the public would go for writing equipment (paper, pens, tablets, stationery, blank books, paper what-nots and household needs such as paper clips—when people still actively used such things.) As printing technology became easier to operate and more and more affordable, stationery shops (store front affairs) invested in little letterpress and engraving set-ups to better serve a growing clientele and hold on to more of the purchase price for their wares and services.</p>
<p>The stationer is also to whom one goes to help conform with local social etiquette (such as the correct calling card, birth announcement, wedding invitation, condolence card, change of address announcement; kind of a one stop shop for printed matters pertaining to getting along with the neighbors.)</p>
<p>Since digital technology has supplanted this lovely, and nostalgic old trade, there has been a major resurgence in new small shop set-ups, primarily with young designers.</p>
