body: "Hello there, everyone.\r\n\r\nI am interested in Fonts for quite some time
  now. A few days ago I was searching on the Internet for a good(i.e., nearly complete),
  free Unicode font. I was amazed how hard it was to find fonts which had a big amount
  of glyphs and were free(and most of the 'free' ones had strings attached like being
  only free for private use on one computer, etc). \r\n\r\nNow I had an idea. What
  if a website would be made, where people can pick one of the 100.000+ glyphs that
  Unicode has nowadays, and draw it, with their mouse, on a simple white with black
  canvas, with an undo and a clear button. The style will of course be a bit hand-drawn,
  shoddy-ish. That's a consequence of this technique but I don't think that it's a
  bad thing, because it will be uniform through the whole font:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drawingd_6329.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple
  people can draw the same glyph, and then votes will  decide which one looks best.
  \r\n\r\nI believe that in this way, with a large group of people, it might be possible
  to create a big unicode font which covers one or multiple of the unicode planes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you, experts of typefaces, think? Is this idea viable?"

    far from exhaustive but a good starting point.\r\n\r\nWhat are your requirements
    for a 'free' font? If you do not want to be bound to the terms and conditions
    of a license agreement then creating your own font would definitely be the best
    way to go, but guaranteeing any kind of consistency and quality across such a
    vast undertaking would be very difficult.\r\n\r\nFor what purpose do you require
    this kind of font? It will almost certainly fall down in terms of engineering
    if not design. If you need a font which meets the requirements of coverage for
    testing then you may have more luck with [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=UnicodeBMPFallbackFont|SIL's

    free Unicode fonts, are available out there. (There is, however, only one free
    font I know of, Hanazono, that provides all the Unicode Chinese characters, and
    thus there is no free font that provides all of Unicode. However, Hanazono has
    a BSD license, not a GPL license, so it may be possible to fix that with a font
    editor).

      I think 'amazed' was a bad choice of words. Rather, I am astonished how many
      of the 'better' unicode-fonts have all kinds of restrictions placed on them.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And
      voting? Hopeless.</blockquote>\r\nCould you elaborate this? Certainly, the font
      won't win a beautyprize, but that's not the purpose of the font. \r\n\r\nBasically,
      my goals of the project are the following:\r\n-An interesting experiment, to
      see how well it works to create a font together.\r\n-Creating a font that covers
      all(or as much as possible) of the unicode planes, to create one font that is
      able to display all characters when you don't have another font that has them
      installed.\r\n-Creating a simple unicode-font that can be used by anyone for
      any project without being restricted by any weird licensing.\r\n\r\nI realize
      that one TTF/OTF has a 65.535 cap, but indeed as pointed out, using multiple
      fonts is a solution. Composite fonts are something I didn't know of yet, interesting.\r\n\r\n@hrant:
      Do you have any source about earlier crowd type design projects? I'd love to
      read about them. The only thing I know of right now is the [['GNU unifont'|http://czyborra.com/unifont/]],
      which in fact is one of the most complete, free unicode-typefaces right now.
      The big problem of it is that each of its characters consists of blocks in a
      16x16 grid and glyphs were made with editing the ascii representation of a glyph.
      This means that the font looks 'pixelated' and doesn't looks nice on any size
      bigger than 16px.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a nice day,\r\n\r\n~Accident"

    character set now greatly exceeds the 65,536 glyph limit that is built into the
    sfnt font format (TrueType and OpenType). Considering also that a fully functional
    font will need more than one glyph per character for many scripts, it is clearly
    impossible to create a single font that supports all of Unicode in today's principal
    font formats.\r\n\r\nOne could, however, use a composite font format to bundle

    I'm talking about things like the 'composite font representation' in ISO/IEC 14496-28:2012,
    i.e. a wrapper around multiple fonts that present them as if they were a single
    font, with metadata indicating which cmap ranges of each component font take precedence.\r\n\r\nEach
    sfnt font can only contain a maximum of 65,536 glyphs (with functional limits
    on other tables in the font based on the same architectural restrictions). But
    multiple sfnt fonts could be packaged within a composite font representation to
    cover all of Unicode."

  body: "I think the criticisms of the initial proposal are sound, but the recent
    assertions that 'design by committee' necessarily results in compromise or that
    the results of voting are 'random' seem to be to overstate the case and ignore
    the possibilities of a well designed process.\r\n\r\nIf there are established
    design principles and directions, agreed upon by consensus of participants at
    the beginning of the project, then this kind of collaborative design approach
    doesn't need to end up in compromise or a Frankenfont. 'Crowd-sourcing' is probably
    the wrong term to use, in that it implies little or no active coordination, but
    in the same way as an individual designer decides upon a set of criteria by which
    to judge the success or failure of individual glyphs -- within what Nick rightly
    identifies as a system within which the parts must work together --, a group of
    people can come to the same kinds of criteria and make collective judgements through
    discussion, consensus and, if necessary, voting. In such a situation, I would
    consider voting to be something of a last resort, when there are two or more proposed
    designs that appear to equally meet the criteria, in which case majority preference
    is a legitimate basis for deciding which to adopt. I would not set up the process
    to be based on voting as a default or initial decision making process: a discussion/consensus
    approach, while time consuming, will produce much better results.\r\n\r\nI did
    a workshop with the MA students at Reading earlier this year in which they designed
    and built an 8-bit display font in two days. I provided them with five key glyphs
    by way of establishing the characteristics of the design (obviously in a longer
    time frame this too could be arrived at by group decision): H O i o n. Responsibility
    for individual glyphs was determined by drawing cards, and this happened three
    times during the two days, each set of cards building on what had been accomplished
    in the previous round (e.g. there was no point in having two people independently
    designing left and right quote marks whole someone else designed the comma, since
    these are all related marks, so the first round included the comma, the second
    the left quote, and the third the right quote). Key roles in the project were
    those of Curator, also chosen by card draw and responsible for collating the glyphs
    and updating the master FontLab source file, and, in the later rounds, Consistency
    Checker, who would check alignments, overshoots, stem widths, etc..\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://ohbendy.tumblr.com/post/17089158534/font-workshop-with-john-hudson\">Ben
    Mitchell wrote blog post about the workshop.</a>\r\n\r\nThe most important aspect
    of the project was the group crit halfway through in which the design was discussed
    and, for instance, the b d p q glyphs compared and decision made, by the group,
    as to which bowl shape worked best and what approach to take to harmonising them."

    from the statement \u201CMultiple people can draw the same glyph, and then votes
    will decide which one looks best.\u201D I assumed that voters would be choosing
    glyphs by comparing each glyph of a Unicode character with all other glyphs of
    the same character, irrespective of what the other characters looked like. Hence
    the selections would be random in relation to one another. \r\n\r\nHowever, on
    further consideration, it would be possible to create a live, interactive decision
    process, in which a block of multi-character text is displayed online, using all
    the currrent selections, continually updated. Then the voter could insert different
    glyphs for a particular character in the text, and see how well they worked in
    context. Rather like the Metrics window in FontLab.\r\n\r\nMind you, it would

    or use for that. The demands of even one complex script are a difficult thing
    for even a professional designer, so I wouldn't have faith in a crowd-sourced
    version. Key dimensions and positioning have to be shared among the designers,
    just to make the orthography correct, never mind about aesthetics. And someone
    would have to do the VOLT production, just to make the thing work. \r\n\r\nJohn's
    right, the most important thing is the curating, or regulating, of the design.
    In the Reading project this wasn't too difficult, as we were dealing with basically
    an extended Latin character set, but a lot more questions would arise in the scope
    of a full Unicode project. (It would be interesting to see how far a group of
