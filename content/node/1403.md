body: 'I am an editor of Czech typographical magazine TYPO. For the next issue, we
  plan to publish a block of texts about Chinese calligraphy. As I live in Europe,
  I don&#39;t have many contacts to Chinese artists and designers. Could you please
  help me with that? <BR> <BR>1&#41; We would like to publish preview of CONTEMPORARY
  calligraphy. Can you recommend me some great calligraphers from China? <BR> <BR>2&#41;
  We plan to add a special section on how to type Chinese glyphs at computer keyboard.
  Don&#39;t you know any experienced Chinese, who can answer our computer related
  questions? <BR> <BR>Thank you very much for your help! <BR> <BR>Filip Blazek <BR>TYPO
