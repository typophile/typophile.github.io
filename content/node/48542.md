  thick and thin hand lettering I scanned in and put in illustrator.\r\nI want it
  to be as crisp as possible. The quality must be there.\r\nI clicked Live Trace and
  it did something, not sure what.\r\nIt is still in a BOX, \r\nand I can't select
  individual letters and move them.\r\n\r\nAfter I get rid of the box thing (how,
  please)\r\nI need to move each letter by itself..\r\nIs this all I do?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  the letters are black, but I need transparency, not white, as the background, \r\nso
  I can put the lettering layer over a photograph.\r\n\r\nHelp!\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  a step by step.\r\n\r\nThanks alot!"

  body: "Livetrace produces a big specialized group designed to be colored with live
    paint. You still have to expand those into regular vectors, which will then be
    in a big group that usually requires lots of merging and tweaking. The box the
    letters are in will be part of the group and may be dozens of little shapes that
    have to be selected with the magic wand and then deleted. \r\n\r\nIMHO it\u2019s
    usually faster and easier to trace letters manually. Livetrace is great for vectorizing
    complex drawings or photos when there just isn\u2019t time to do them manually. "

  body: " LiveTrace works pretty well if you are vectorizing hand lettering \u2014
    when the rough look is what you are seeking. If you have black ink on white paper,
    here are the steps after you scan in the drawing.\r\n\r\n1. open a new file in
    illustrator\r\n2. place your graphic (File > Place)\r\n3. make sure you have LiveTrace
    active (window > workspace > default)\r\n4. click on the placed graphic\r\n5.
    using the dropdown arrow next to LIVE TRACE button, pick a setting. TYPE is a
    good one, but the controls can be further dialed in.\r\n6. click on the EXPAND
    button.\r\n7. use the magic wand to select the black only\r\n8. cut (apple X)\r\n9.
    select all (apple A) (selects all the stuff you don't want)\r\n10. delete\r\n11.
    paste (apple V) and your letters are now alone on the artboard\r\n\r\nthere's
    no LivePaint involved\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trace1_6003.jpg]"

    I did not understand how to set up window.workspace.default.\r\nThis just gave
    me a choice of Basic -panel-type- I just didnt' understand that part.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    when I used the dropdown arrow next to live trace,\r\nI could not pick a setting
    like Type etc.\r\nI could only pick- Make - make and expand - tracing options\r\n\r\nI
    did not see at all the graphic you illustrated in your comment, I cannot find
    that drop down thing.\r\n\r\nI expect these things are things that I can experiment
    and refine with,\r\nyet I don't see them.\r\n\r\nSo, I think I missing a part
    of your instructions., which were great!\r\nThanks so much, I was able to do this.\r\n\r\nAny
    comments, Beejay, on the things I couldn't get would be appreciated."

    after you paste, click on the lettering layer, and with the Move Tool, you can
    move the letter and it will become selected. Then Edit > Fill > \r\n3. use the
    magic wand to select the lettering "

    now, I've got the type selected with the move tool.\r\n\r\nWhen I go to Edit-Fill
    - it says color. and i check okay, and the lettering turned gray. Not sure why.\r\n\r\nI
    really need to change the colors and experiment in photoshop.\r\n\r\nAny way?
    I can't imagine they wouldn't let you do this, just clicking around on colors
    to see what they look like....\r\n\r\nthanks for any furthur instructions. i really

    Photoshop as a smart object so that any changes made in illustrator will take
    place in the Photoshop document as well. That way you can edit the colors in illustrator
    and they will update in Photoshop when you save. I use Photoshop and Illustrator
    Cs3 for windows so im not certain what is different but in Photoshop i can go
    to File> Open As Smart Object and then using the move tool drag the smart object
    from one document to the other.\r\n\r\n"
