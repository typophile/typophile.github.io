body: I followed a post on Fontfeed to this [[http://vimeo.com/3830490|video]] of
  a guy in Japan doing what you might call a psychogeographical font, and noticed
  he was using some tool I'd never encountered before...[[http://musashi.or.tv/oteditmac.htm|OTEdit]].
  The site, and most of the interface in the app itself is all in Japanese, but I
  was able to start a font and draw a glyph. It seems like a good, simple tool for
  somebody just starting out in type design. Does anyone know much about this app
  or its developer/s? An English localization would be nice.

  body: "I've never used OTEdit before because this app doesn't seem to be enough
    for making Latin fonts. It's reasonable to buy it, but it seems that OTEdit can't
    handle kerning data and OpenType feature. I've checked the manual of it, but the
    manual doesn't mention kerning pair and OpenType features at all.\r\nI think this
    app seem to be for making Japanese font, not for making Latin font. If your fonts
    don't need to have kerning pair and OpenType features, this app might be good
    for you, but if you want to make integrated fonts in future, I don't recommend
    you use it.\r\nOf course, you'll be able to add feature and kerning data to your
    font using AFDKO after generating font from OTEdit, but I don't know whether OTEdit
    can generate proper OpenType font for Latin fonts.\r\n\r\nIt's a pity that Musashi
    systems doesn't have English language site and English ver. applications.\r\n\r\nSo
    far, this is the only type design tool to make Japanese font in Japanese language
    interface, so I've heard that some of Japanese design school use this app. for
    learning type design.\r\n "
