		<div class="commentbody">In 1991, I purchased several typefaces from [[http://www.imageclub.com/|Image Club]] in Calgary, Alberta. I had just written a magazine feature about the company and was excited at the prospect of choosing from what seemed at the time like an extensive catalog of type. The idea that I could go beyond what came on the Mac or with software packages seemed pretty wild.

Three that I remember being on those hotly anticipated floppies were: 

<strong>Groschen</strong> (a quirky, wide sans serif that I can't seem to find on reputable commercial font sites, only as a free TTF download from a site theat seems sketchy -- won't name it here);

<strong>Caslon Antique</strong> (Did I mention I was living in Alberta? The rustic aesthetic must have rubbed off on me); and

<strong>Liberty</strong> (again, I don't see it available at reputable commercial font sites, but it looks like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/goudy-handtooled/|Goudy Handtooled]]) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">The first three fonts I bought were part of a load of type that damn near busted the springs on my brand-new 1971 Datsun pickup. I had found this lode over near West Burke, Vermont.

I know there was one case of large Goudy Handtooled (see previous post for a link). What else was in that type stand I do not recall. I cleaned out the mouse poop, re-sorted all the foul distribution, and then . . . never used any of it, for I had no press. I sold it, for less than I paid, to the pressroom supervisor where I worked.

The first day FontShop SF was in business I ordered a font (on floppy). Since it was their first-ever order they threw in a floppy with another font on it. I never used that one, either. The floppy rotted away in my nasty basement after we moved.

That’s to say, real lead type!

Had to import all the little packets wrapped in brown paper, from Germany into the UK, and lay them out in the second-hand type cases I had set up in my father-in-law’s garage.

Cost me the equivalent of about $40,000 in today’s prices for just 3 weights (24pt, 18pt, 14pt, if I remember correctly, which sometimes I don’t after 42 years in the typesetting & print trade).

But I wanted it as something special that I was convinced would make my newly-started Wedding Invitation business really stand out!

Our typesetting machine (A-M) came with a bunch of fonts. These seemed sufficient for a while. The first two "fonts" I ordered were a special Times Roman -- all the ligatures, old-style numbers, and small caps on one disk, and a special Berner (aka Sabon) with the same. They had to dig into the drawing drawer for the ligatures. The A-M "Sabon" were copies of Monotype drawings. 

The special work made them cost about US $500 each circa 1980; couldn't afford a third one for a while.</div>

*To answer your "why not the popular stuff" question Jacky, I think most people get the popular workhorse stuff either through software like Adobe Creative Suite, school, or from places they work rather than having to pay for less common faces. I'm over 40 and have only paid for all the type I use for about the last 5-6 years (including an Adobe Font Folio license).</div>

I guess for myself and everyone here in Typophile. Didn't study graphic design back in art school or worked with a graphic designer for the past 10 years. So I do have a curiosity (And a sore sense of inadequacy) about what a real graphic designer is like.

I remember two month ago you were surveying good folks here for Academic purpose. Unfortunately, mine survey is purely for indulgence. </div>

Industria and Scala <strong>were</strong> popular in 1990, and the other package of extra condensed faces was very useful, as there were no extra condensed fonts in the free bundles at that time (e.g. Adobe Plus Pack).

		<div class="commentbody">Ooohhh — rubdown type… I had hundreds of sheets of that. MecaNorma, Letraset, Chartpak and others. Even some that were not rubdown, but more or less floatdown (you’d cut out the bits, separate from the backing in water and place the transparent plastic with printed type on your layout).

A big part of that was Helvetica, I am ashamed to admit, because I did a lot of exacting layouts for those information and serial number plates on machinery (best I did was for a F-16 droptank, but that was in Univers). You needed black as well as white type for that (the layouts were reversed) and white type was a bitch to work with — it would crack when you just looked at it. I must have tried every available rubdowntool available at the time. Had quite a collection of scalpels and x-acto’s too.

Before rubdown I would hop over to the art school 400 yards from my high school during lunch break, set type and make prints on baryte, to use in the high school magazine I designed, edited and illustrated almost singlehandedly. Learned to love Gill Sans.

Tossed all of the rubdowns the second year after I went Mac. Most of the eeeee’s and EEEEE’s were gone, anyway.
