body: "Hi there,\r\nnot sure if I added this to the right section but here we go:\r\n\r\nOne
  of my clients branding guidelines states to use OCR-A for headings, subheadings
  and intro text. And to adjust the spacing so it doesn't look like a monospaced font.
  Well, of course this works if you use the right software and know what you are doing.
  \r\nTo make my client's job easier I was looking for a substitute and found one
  which using the OCR-A letter shapes but with the spacing adjusted. But guess what,
  I can't seem to find the font any longer.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, has anyone come
  across a font using the OCR-A letter shapes but is non-monospaced?\r\n\r\nHope this
  makes sense\r\nJoerg\r\n"
