  invitation for a girl who's pretty particular about the type of font she wants for
  the names.  She wants this one (which I think may have been actually done by hand)
  but what she likes is the calligraphy, hand drawn look of it, the girly, bubbly
  script of it and the boldness of the font (she's not a fan of thin calligraphy).\r\n\r\nSo
  I need help either confirming that this is hand drawn (she just sent me a picture
  of it so I don't have much to investigate) and if it is hand drawn, is there a font
  that is very similar to this with the characteristics explained above!\r\n\r\nThis
  would be a life saver!! Thank you guys! "

  body: This is hand done - look at the difference in letters. All are not the same
    as they would be with a font. Go to Dafont and click on Script/handwritten for
    a start.

    option.\r\n\r\nTwo possibilities with a bit more style: <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/peoni-pro/'
    target='_blank'>Peoni Pro</a> and <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/harlowe/'
