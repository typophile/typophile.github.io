  <BR> <BR>Anyway, I just identified it thanks to a link someone posted in a different
  forum.  <BR><a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/19512.html" target="_blank">http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/19512.html</a>
  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s by Aldo Novarese, and it&#39;s called Quirinus. Agfa-Monotype
  has it digitized. I&#39;m surprised no one caught it, but I appreciate the attempts!

    into believing that what we do is  <BR>very hard, which in turn has everyone call
    us &#39;type gurus&#39;.  <BR><i>&#39;Type gurus&#39;</i>... ahhh. Soundz good.

    target="_blank"> Quirinus Bold</a> &#40;we actually purchased a  <BR>license a
    few months ago&#41; but the contrast between  <BR>strokes and hairlines is so
    extreme in that cut that  <BR>I never made the connection with your sample.  <BR>The
    version in your sample is simply delightful and  <BR>should be digitized. It looks
    so contemporary that  <BR>it made me believe it was something by <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html"
