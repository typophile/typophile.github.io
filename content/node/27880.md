body: "I am basically a self-taught graphic designer (okay a few classes, but mostly
  reading lots of books), who only works for non-profs (aka no budget). I never charge
  for my work, including all costs associated with my work. I get lots of compliments
  and work hard to make my work look like it isn't done for free (which has only been
  accomplished because of the help I've received from the people at this site). And
  this leads me to my point...\r\n\r\nMany <strong><a>THANKS</strong></a> to all those
  who over the years have helped answer my type id questions and evaluate my designs.
  I will never be able to afford all the gorgeous fonts I'd love to have, but so appreciate
  all the hard work that goes into them. But because of the efforts of the people
  here, I'm able to quickly fix problems and identify fonts and only purchase the
  ones I really need. \r\n\r\nThrough this site, I've learned to admire font design
  as the fine art it truly is. And I really respect those of you that have responded
  to my ignorant questions with reponses that didn't make me feel so stupid after
  all.\r\n\r\nSo from someone who was forced to become a graphic designer (I was the
  only one who could figure out how to use ALDUS pagemaker at the time) and has truly
  become obsessed with design work...\r\n\r\n<strong><a>A pat on the back and kudos
  to all at this site! You guys are awesome!"
