I've seen this specific type of shading treatment on a vast number of logos that I've run across and I love it. 

For clarification purposes, does this specific type of shading have a formal name or technique associated with it?

I've always figured that this kind of effect could be done roughly with an algorithm or black and white conversion plugin and then fine tuned, rather than entirely hand drawn--but I've never run across anything that splits shades of gray into black bars of varying thickness like this. 

Might any of you kind folks here on Typophile have any recommendations on how to consistently produce this effect?

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oldnick's suggestion of "line screen" sounds right, although these logos have been tweaked way beyond what you'd get with an automated screen technique that you'd apply to a photo or whatever. I'm sure all of those examples were hand constructed.

It's a style that was very popular once, but to me the technique now looks dated. I remember doing similar things back in the 90s.</div>

Earthach: I love Retro graphics and tech logos, it's one of the main reasons why I'm aiming to replicate this specific technique. :)

I think I may have found a really solid way to do it using blends and very precisely sized patterns in illustrator. I'll post a small how-to if this ends up working out well and you guys are interested at all.

Patterns work out quite well, specifically 60 degree diagonals (matches isometric / axonometric marks much better) at varying line widths. Much better than trying to finesse everything by hand, can also easily preview at varying widths on the fly, etc.

Transform pattern at small increments to line up the bars > expand > clean up.

Instant retro logo!

		<div class="commentbody">The technique is called Xylography or Woodcut (German "Holzstich").

It's an old technique in which an image is carved into the surface of a block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed. There are different variations that involve different patterns and techniques. You can read more about it here:

:: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylographic
:: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing

It's actually a cool technique if applied properly. Unfortunately this style got a bad wrap in the late 90s when it was widely used and abused through numerous Photoshop filters :-) Hope this helps.</div>
