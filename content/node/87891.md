  designed by Wolfgang Homola, is a geometric sans serif typeface. Unlike most existing
  geometric sans serif typefaces, it has asymmetrical counters, making it look fresher,
  more dynamic and more contemporary. Simple geometric forms \u2013 such as the circle
  or the square \u2013 played a certain role in the design of the letterforms, but
  in order to introduce more fluidity into the rather stiff and rigid concept of geometric
  sans serif typefaces, a lot of optical corrections were necessary.\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Soleil|Soleil]]
  is based on the modernist ideas of simplicity, clarity and reduction to essential
  forms. Yet its letter shapes are not the result of geometric construction, but of
  a design process that brings together simplicity and fluidity, clarity and rhythm.\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Soleil|Soleil]]
  has a rather large x-height, making it legible also in small sizes or from a bigger
  distance. The typeface family consists of six weights.\r\nThe Opentype version also
  allows for the implementation of typographic features such as Small Caps, lining
  and old-style figures, both tabular and proportional, ligatures, alternate characters,
  case-sensitive variants and fractions.\r\nSoleil offers a wide range of potential
  applications: signage and wayfinding systems, book and magazine design, branding
  and corporate publications.\r\n\r\nmore information at: [[http://www.type-together.com/Soleil]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soleil_12_4467.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soleil_8_3519.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soleil_10_4622.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soleil_11-1_4949.jpg]"

    counters in a geometric sans are a characteristic of Proxima Sans/Nova, published
    in 1995/2005.\r\nIn fact, they are primarily what distinguish it from the later
    Gotham (2002), which has symmetric counters.\r\nThose are the two types which
    IMHO define the contemporary era, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the symmetry of
    counters in a geometric face is an issue of freshness, dynamism, or contemporariness.\r\n"

  body: "Given the success of Proxima and Brandon, it could be argued that a new geometric
    sans with asymmetric counters is not fresh and different, but following the leader.
    This is not to deny that Soleil is an excellent new face with a distinctive personality,
    but I don\u2019t think that its asymmetric counters alone can be considered a
    marketing point-of-difference.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the game, with so many
    foundries publishing faces of subtle distinction, descriptive text beyond \u201Cit\u2019s
    a geometric sans with a little bit of the rigidity taken off\u201D doesn\u2019t
    add much\u2014although a certain amount of typespeak does give the impression
    that a type is important.\r\n\r\nI find the lower case \u201Ct\u201D to be the
    signature glyph."

  body: "Hi, I am the designer of this typeface.\r\nI am not very familiar with Gotham
    and its development, but I think if there are similarities it is because both
    are based on the same source: lettering in architecture.\r\n\r\nSoleil was initially
    designed for a signage and wayfinding system.\r\n(For those of you who were at
    ATypI Mexico in 2009 or at the ICTVC conference 2010 in Cyprus and saw my lecture:
    sorry that I repeat here the same old stuff.) This signage and wayfinding system
    was developed in 2007 by Bohatsch and Partners in Vienna\r\n[[http://www.bohatsch.at/]]\r\nI
    was part of the design team for this signage and wayfinding system (together with
    Walter Bohatsch, Andreas Soller and Julia Krauth), and I also designed the typeface
    for the signage system (which would later become Soleil).\r\n\r\nThe brief for
    the signage and wayfinding system asked to integrate the original metal letters
    used in the building (a 1950ies modernist building) into the new signage and wayfinding
    system, and so we proposed to design a new typeface for it, because none of the
    then existing typefaces matched exactly the shapes of the original metal letters
    (which were upper case only) used in the staircase of building.\r\n\r\nWhen I
    did the usual test prints, I was surprised that it worked quite well also for
    longer texts, and so I decided to release it. So that's the story behind this
    typeface. For a more detailed account: There is also an article about this project
    and the design process that led to Soleil in TYPO magazine no 41, 2010, pp 52-57\r\n[[http://www.typo.cz/en/]]\r\n\r\nI
    tried to upload some pictures that illustrate what I wrote, but it seems there
    are some problems with uploading right now ...\r\nHowever, here is a link where
    you can see these pictures:\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/71254719@N02/sets/72157628249625095/detail/]]\r\n"

  body: "That's interesting, I'm surprised it\u2019s not mentioned by the foundry.\r\n\r\nI
    did a similar project with students at Humber College in Toronto.\r\nI asked them
    to digitize the typeface used in the Toronto Transit System subway (underground),
    designed in the 1950s, modernist, all caps, and design a companion lower case.
    But we didn't get any further than the one weight, roman.\r\n\r\nSomething similar
    that I had created earlier was my Figgins revival, which developed a sans family
    from a single-weight bold all caps font.\r\n\r\nI would almost call this genre
    (if such a thing it be) \u201Chistorical fiction\u201D, were it not for the fact
    that the original source material is followed quite closely and included in the
    much larger end product. Is \u201Cspeculative revival\u201D an appropriate term?"
