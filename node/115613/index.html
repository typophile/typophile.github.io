Arguably, changing the default number style doesn't add functionality. I changed the default number style from tabular proportional to tablular oldstyle for use with an older text editor, for preparing our invoices. Of course, it was a SIL OFL font,  but I can see the reasoning here, too.

The bigger issue is that the Brill fonts can be used without permission only for personal, non-commercial use. I imagine if the intended use fits that category, changing the default number style is permissible. 

But why not just make contact with Brill and ask?  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">My question is, Is it possible..? Not, is it legal? (Which is not to say that I don't care about the law.) The tweek is to overcome a limitation of Microsoft Word, namely that Open Type number styles cannot be applied to the footnote number reference. Whatever the default number style of the font is, that style will be used in Word for the footnote references. I would prefer to use tabular lining, but to do this, I have to make tabular lining the default number style in the font.

None of this is for commercial use (it is for papers in college), and it would not, in my humble opinion, add functionality to the font. It changes a default "setting." It does not give the font more functionality.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're not getting good advice here, I suggest you ask somewhere else. I tested two ways of doing what you wanted, checking the results in both OpenOffice and InDesign. I neither own nor use MS Word. 

Both techniques worked to a degree -- addressed and solved the particular problem you mentioned --  and took less than a half an hour. The half hour includes limited testing. Both had compromises. One way, you loose all OpenType functionality with numbers (arbitrary fractions, true-cut superiors, any number style other than default, etc.). The scaling functions with numbers that MS Word uses should still work -- they did in InDesign. And why wouldn't they?

 The other way you retain these as OT features, (except for oldstyle proportional), at the expense of having the wrong kerning with the *default* numbers. The result is not perfect, but then neither are tabular lining numbers.

To do the job properly is, as has been said, a lot of work. Basically, portions of the features code has to be rewritten. That would include some work with the classes used in writing features.

As far as who controls the license, I imagine Brill commissioned the fonts from John, so Brill controls any and all license matters. I would ask them. You don't want to be in violation of either US or European law, right?

I imagine these two techniques are obvious, but in any case, I personally am not going to list them unless Brill, & as a courtesy (not legal requirement) John, both say it's OK.

Edit:

BTW, I'm amazed that Word won't let you associate another font with note calls. That by itself would solve the problem you mentioned.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. Yes, Brill own these fonts, they invested a lot of money in them, they're making them freely available for non-commercial use, and yes, they have the right to determine the license permissions under which that happens. That said, I believe the no-modifications clause exists mainly to prevent unauthorised messing with the design, and contra Hrant's comments about 'if you want them to keep an eye on you', I would suggest contacting Brill and explaining what you want and why. They are among the most reasonable and accommodating people I have ever dealt with.

2. Technically, I'd say that the easiest way to get to where you want from where you're starting is to edit the cmap table. You could use TTX, which is free, to dump the cmap table to XML, edit it in a text editor to re-map the appropriate Unicode values to the tabular lining numerals, and then use TTX again to merge the edited cmap table back into the font. You will lose some functionality in OpenType Layout if you do this, because the GSUB lookups for numeral style presume that the default style is oldstyle proportional (which Brill wanted because that is the most common usage in their publications), so changing to other styles and arbitrary fraction support will break. However, it seems to me that for your purposes you could simple edit the font name table too (also using TTX), and simply make a separate font for use in Word footnote style.</div>

John, I find your solution rather brutal but, of course, if you are stuck with a dumb text editor, that is the simplest thing to do.

It seems to me though that you can get a fully functional font by just swapping the strings “zero” and “zero.LT” etc everywhere in the ttx files except in the cmap and GSUB tables, and replacing “lnum” by “pnum” and “tnum” by “onum” in the GSUB table. That can be done quite simply with a stream editor, like sed (on one ttx file without GSUB and cmap tables, and another with just GSUB and cmap tables). Or am I missing something?</div>

That's always a matter of taste. Here is a comparison

I use Word only when I am required to and it is hard for me to guess Word users tastes.

		<div class="commentbody">For me a good* typographer is one who leverages the true power of typefaces, and this can only be done by first appreciating this power, as opposed to pretending that what's on hand is fine. Many people don't realize they're not good* because they're blind to this power. Of course compromise (including on cost) is always necessary, but pretending one is not compromising is not.

* Maybe I should say "great", because "good" can imply passable; the sort of person that merely makes the wheels keep moving. Just like most type designers, mind you.

Most of all, a typographer can't really help his users if he has little respect for the field of type design; it's another form of blindness. Vignelli for example is a horrible typographer for this reason.

Using the ttx file as a text file instead of a structured xml file reminds indeed of another era. In this case though, all that is required is swapping strings representing glyph names;  where those names appear in the structure tree is irrelevant; treating them as text thus seems appropriate; for instance the GPOS table (or its "dump" if you will), whatever its complexity, remains correct after the swaps, without any effort. 

Concerning Charles' remark that there is no onum feature, there is a substitution table for "lnum" that takes text figures and replaces them by lining figures. Since the glyph names have been swapped, the effect of the table is to do just the opposite, and the feature needs to be renamed "onum" (this is in the case Proportional Lining is chosen as default).

No matter how good a free font is (such as my own Arasan from the 90s, or more recent fonts made by a very small number of <em>salaried professionals</em>) it won't help a pedestrian typesetter (I reserve "typographer" for those who actually "get" type) contribute to culture. The rest is boring, dead, money.
