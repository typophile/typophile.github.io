  body: To be honest, I don't think it's so "sweet". The 'B' is awkward and the [[counter|counters]]
    are clogged, evidence of mechanical extrapolation to make the heavy weights, rather
    than redrawing. This is not Chester's best work. I'm hoping he updates it <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/Example+About/">like
    he did Apex Sans</a>.

  body: It's true. If he were a less genuine fellow, Chester could claim he anticipated
    the trend by several years.

  body: It's that exact idiosyncrasy I find sweet, actually; I wouldn't dare use this
    outside the awkward-pasty-indie-rock concert poster subgenre
