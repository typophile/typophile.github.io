body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nDoes there exist any available application or tool
  for generating a pdf (or jpg or png or...) unicode code chart? For example, input
  a range (say, start=0600,stop=06FF) and a font name: Then the resultant pdf gives
  you a unicode code chart covering that range (as supported by the named font), with
  the code point as caption per each cell... \r\n\r\nAnything like that available?
  Perhaps an online utility? Seems like a common enough task that a utility may be
  floating out there somewhere...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "The AFDKO command <code>tx</code> gives you charts and if you use the <code>-g</code>
    option with a list of characters, you can get the chart for those glyphs. However
    <code>tx</code> does not appear to accept a unicode range. On the Mac or on Linux
    you can however easily generate the list of character names if you have the FontForge
    python class installed. Here is a script that does that. Let us call it <code>listcharnames</code>\r\n<PRE>\r\n----
    cut line\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\nimport fontforge,sys\r\nfnt=fontforge.open(sys.argv[1],1)\r\n\r\nstart
    = int(sys.argv[2],16)\r\nend=int(sys.argv[3],16)\r\n\r\nunilist=[g.unicode for
    g in fnt.glyphs() \\\r\n    if ((g.unicode <= end) and (g.unicode >= start))]\r\nunilist.sort()\r\nprint
    ','.join(fnt[u].glyphname for u in unilist)\r\n---\r\n</PRE>\r\nThen you can also
    give yourself the command <code>mkchart</code>\r\n<PRE>\r\n--- cut line\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\ntx
    -pdf -g `listcharnames $1 $2 $3` $1\r\n---\r\n</PRE>\r\nand to get your chart
    say for Arno Pro for the hex values between 0x0060 and 0xFFFF, you need only type\r\n<code>\r\nmkchart
    ArnoPro-Regular.otf 0060 FFFF > ~/sheet.pdf\r\n</code>\r\nand you get your sheet
    (to get it on the desktop on the mac, you rather redirect to <code>~/Desktop/sheet.pdf</code>)\r\n\r\nHere
    the sheet I get with\r\n<code>\r\nmkchart ArnoPro-Regular.otf 0060 00AF > ~/sheet.pdf\r\n</code>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArnoSheet_5282.png]"

  body: "Hi Michel, Karl,\r\nThanks for the tips; *much* appreciated! \r\n\r\nI downloaded
    the latest AFDKO, but it seems broken:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/116997\r\n\r\nOnce
    I get it working I'll try to build a chart (not sure if I can get the FF python
    class working on Win though).\r\n\r\nAs for FontExplorer X Pro, I can view the
    character info under \"Characters\" in the Information dialog, but there is no
    way to export that to a file with or without the specifications you mentioned
    (yes, most of those specs are available for preview). The only one seems to be
    able to export is the basic preview on the main page. Any advice would be appreciated...
    \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    if you have problems with FontForge, here is some replacement code for <code>listcharnames</code>
    written in Lua for LuaTeX. That avoids  having to install the Fontforge python

    compared to the Python script but I am not experienced enough in Lua to improve.\r\n\r\nIncidently,
    should it not be possible to generate the desired chart directly with LuaTeX or
    LuaLaTeX?\r\n\r\nMichel"

    it does indeed work, so as soon as we can figure out what's wrong with AFDKO I
    should be back in business.\r\n\r\nIn ConTeXt (based on luaTeX) there is a command
    \\showfont[fontname][all] that prints out charts, but it currently skips some
    characters in the font I'm working on (no idea why). I could probably design my
    own, but I don't have the skill to design a chart macro quickly and no longer
    have the time these days to spend hours working on TeX macro-programming. In ConTeXt,
    it would probably be more efficient to write a fontchart module in lua anyway,
    and that's definitely beyond my skill set.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
