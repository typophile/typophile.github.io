  summer day last year and we were discussing representing a 'community' through a
  typeface as well as the impetus or reasons to embark on making a typeface (historical
  reference or perceived problem). The idea came to mind to try collecting writing
  samples and making an 'average' of them in order to create a sort of average conception
  of the alphabet, and afterwards to use this as a basis/skeleton for a typeface.
  \r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nHere is the current incarnation:\r\nhttp://www.abiabiabi.com/content/collective/collective.html\r\n\r\nEven
  though I had assumed the end result would be fairly clear, what was most surprising
  thing for me was that a fairly legible sans-serif emerged from the cacophony of
  individual voices. The question now is whether it is worth it to pursue the project
  further and begin to refine a skeleton to eventually base a typeface upon.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

    good luck! I'll be interested in seeing what further refinements produce.

    <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/720/adrianfrutiger.html\">Frutiger picture</a>

    quite curious what these conditions were \u2026 Do you mind sharing?\r\n\r\n<cite>representing
    a \u2018community\u2019 through a typeface</cite>\r\nAs far as I can tell from
    your samples shown, this community is pretty homogeneous, no? Homogeneous, i.e.
    American. If your experiment would include some German writers for instance, I\u2019d
    bet there were descenders with uc J, no (or lesser) bars with uc I, etc.pp.\r\n\r\n<cite>average
    conception of the alphabet</cite>\r\nYes, it is. But where does it come from?\r\nI
    would say that it\u2019s the forms we learn and internalize at school, \xB1 individual
    wearing to some extent. This picture shows 3 layered fonts, all made for the use
    on primer worksheets for teaching handwriting\u2014US style (bottom); in comparison
    to one of your samples (top).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/underlying_6148.gif]\r\n\r\n(Schoolhousefonts\u2019

    body: "hrant:\r\n\r\nThanks for the Vlad Atanasiu reference, I'll be sure to look
      into it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorian:\r\n\r\nAs for the sample collection methodology
      there were a few basic 'controls' to the experiment, (but really calling them
      controls is a bit of a misnomer) everyone was asked to sit down with the same
      kind of paper, with the amount of space given to everyone else and using the
      same pencil. The use of pencil (fairly soft lead) allowed for us to gauge pressure
      and this was factored into the end result as well (people that press hard when
      writing made darker samples and thereby represented more in the final result).
      In the preliminary tests I had implemented more controls and instead of a blank
      space they were asked to put each letter in an individual gridded unit, but
      we dropped this because it seemed to provide a subconscious limit on the amount
      of space you could use, I liked the larger blank space because listing out the
      alphabet is a fairly automatic thing so therefore people could get into their
      own rhythm easier. If you have any suggestions as to the refinement of this
      methodology that would be great.\r\n\r\nI think the question of where the 'average'
      conception comes from is worth a detailed look. The current incarnation was
      gathered from a decidedly diverse group of people, we had tried to get as much
      range in how people write as possible. Upon retrospect now it would have been
      interesting to do this with a class of grade 1 students, and compare the overlaid
      result with the reference material (Perhaps that is a future possibility). I
      also heard about this student in Germany who was doing a thesis project collecting
      the the 'primer worksheet' fonts from around the world, I should check in on
      how she is doing on it."

  body: "Abi, thanks for the explanation of your methodology.\r\n\r\n<cite>listing
    out the alphabet is a fairly automatic thing</cite>\r\nYes, and of course this
    is a legitimate approach. But then, it ain\u2019t the way we usually write text,
    is it? With this method of isolated letters, one after another (and, at that,
    the \u2018probands\u2019 concious about being examined), you\u2019re likely to
    get more \u2018idealized\u2019, conventionalized characters\u2014and I don\u2019t
    even think about ligatures or \u2018joined script\u2019.\r\n\r\nIf (and I say
    <em>if</em>, as there is absolutely no need to do so) you want to collect the
    \u2018plain normal handwriting\u2019 (There is no such thing, btw. Or thousands,
    for every single person, depending on oh-so-many circumstances), there is no alternative
    to collect random handwriting samples that were not produced for this purpose.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>the question of where the \u2018average\u2019 conception comes
    from is worth a detailed look.</cite>\r\nWell, if you are taught that the \u2018I\u2019
    has bars, you\u2019ll write it like that. As a child, and later on. Certainly
    some people will personalize/emancipate and drop (or exaggerate) the bars\u2014but
    the school model remains the norm, concerning a certain region and a period of
    time.\r\n\r\n<cite>I also heard about this student in Germany who was doing a
    thesis project collecting the \u2018primer worksheet\u2019 fonts from around the
    world</cite>\r\nAre you talking about Linda? Ha, small world of typography! ;-)
    I did a similar project, we exchanged some stuff. If you\u2019ve a deeper interest
    in handwriting styles used in primers, feel free to contact me."

    knows her well, they met while on exchange to KABK. Small typography world indeed.\r\n\r\nI
    gathered the samples in that way in order to look at the conception of the alphabet,
    a conscious writing. The more idealized versions of the characters and the tiny
    variations of that ideal are what I sought in gathering the samples in the isolated
    manner."
