  3.1 it doesn't change on refresh. I've delved into the code and tried refreshing
  the sifr swf, to no avail. It does show the current face (Tisa) by the site is the
  same. Any thoughts (I'm reluctant to clear my cache)?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRandy"

  body: Isn't the featured face FF Tisa? It says so on my computer, both in Firefox
    3.0.1 and Safari 3.1.2.

    go indeed.\r\n\r\nhowever, disabling Safaris cache instead of clearing it may
    also work: go to <em>Preferences > Advanced</em> and check <em>Show Develop menu
    in menu bar</em>, then choose <em>Disable Caches</em> from that menu."

  body: Thanks guys. Reluctant because I visit some hefty bandwidth abusing sites.
    Not a big deal, I'll try Dan's suggestion... except it just flipped to Tisa. Teaser
    indeed.
