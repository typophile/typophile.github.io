  body: It feels a little overdone. IMPO I would try to simplify. Maybe get rid of
    the things that don&#39;t necessarily need to be there. I really like the symbol.
    I wish the symbol worked without the type. I would concentrate on the symbol and
    then apply the type as a supporting element, right now it feels like the sun needs
    some breathing room.

  body: I agree with David about it being overdone. <BR> <BR>It would appear that
    your logo <a href="http://www.solarpathfinder.com/">is already in action</a>.
    What I gather from their site, is that the device analyses both shade and light.
    This dark/light interplay could be really nice. You have it a bit in the type
    colors, but that feels almost coincidental. Also, the shape of the object itself
    &#40;a reflective dome&#41; could lend itself to some very sharp, clean visuals.
    The sun is a great idea/object to use as the central image, but the ojbect itself
    is more unique to this company. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s by no means a bad mark, but
    it doesn&#39;t seem <i>directly</i> related. It&#39;s a literal translation of
    the name, which is certainly logical at face value, but isn&#39;t directly relevant
    to the actual company or its product. <BR> <BR>Perhaps a merging of a dark field,
    the glass &#39;eye&#39; of the device, and some solar streamers could blend the
    concepts together and simplify the mark. I don&#39;t think an image of a path
    is necessary. The device&#39;s shape and the sun&#39;s shape are the same. Don&#39;t
    pass up that opportunity too quickly.

  body: Great, <BR> <BR>Thanks to the both of you for taking the time to critique.  Yes,
    the logo is already in action. Unfortunately, there was a deadline, and the client
    like the logo.  Perhpas I can do a bit of re-work on it putting your suggestions
    to good use. <BR> <BR>Thanks again... <BR> <BR>~B.Biddle

  body: Hi Brian, <BR> <BR>what disturbs me is the lacking connection of the circle
    inside &#40;which seems to be a prefabricated symbol&#41; and the solar streamers
    around. If you could connect those two you might be able to compensate your overdoing.
    Maybe also clean up the whitespace between the streamers, they seem to be pretty
    randomly placed. <BR> <BR>If I think about it again if you would leave out the
    streamers you&#39;d get a pretty clean mark. Problem, it suffers from a lack of
    individuality.  <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR> <BR>

  body: 'I&#39;d stick to 2 colours. &#40;lose the darker brown/gold&#41; Your flames
    are darker then the sun and there&#39;s an outline of darker brown on it too.  <BR>
    <BR>and again maybe it&#39;s my eyes but the pathfinder text looks slightly gradiated
    - no need for that really. '
