  exactly would the style be called? Wave, swirl?\r\n\r\nhttp://shop.drummondgolf.com.au/images/Slides/30.jpg\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any lists out there regarding design elements as I am looking to compile
  my own list of asthetic like this one for graphics etc so if a client comes in I
  can simply go do you like any of these sorts of styles etc.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be great"

    nicely crafted.\r\nYou can see the attention to detail in the proportional figures.\r\n"

  body: "> Wave, swirl?\r\n\r\nI'd call it a wave or swoosh. Elements like that can
    create a feeling of movement, grace, fluidity, etc.\r\n\r\n> Does anyone have
    any lists...\r\n\r\nIf you Google for \"design trends\" or \"logo trends\" or
    similar phrases you might find some useful articles, although they'd be skewed
    towards trendy elements rather than classic design principles.\r\n\r\nMost designers
    build a collection of clip files for reference and inspiration, although obviously
    you don't want to simply swipe some other designer's ideas but rather use them
    to help stimulate your own thinking. "

  body: HI guys thanks for the posts, Nick do you list your design elements like that
    somewhere or is that something you just subconsciously know when you look at a
    piece of design? When talking to a client do you talk to them in those terms when
    trying to explain what could be good for them?

  body: "No, I just looked at that piece and saw what the designer had done.\r\nI
    generally show clients several options and see which they like best, and never
    discuss technique.\r\nI think the most you can do with the graphic part of a design
    is to discuss its tone, because that is something that clients have a very intuitive
    feel for. If they like it, they like it, if they don't it may seem to them to
    be too old-fashioned, too dull, or not upscale enough, &c. &c., or they may just
    not like it and not know why, but mention that they like the Papyrus font. \r\n"

    you need to practice a bit more at critically assessing a piece of design and
    what it achieves. Once you're good at that you can focus on the desired outcomes
    with your clients rather than the technical and material methods of achieving
    those outcomes. \r\n\r\nYou don't have to have a name for everything you do, but
    you will need a good reason justifying it to the client and a clear explanation
    of how it helps them achieve their stated goals."
