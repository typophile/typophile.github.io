  I am designing a typeface almost ready to be screen printed. However, the letter
  "S" has been killing me! Any tips, tricks, or some sort of dark magic to conjure
  a good "S." Any sort of help would be neat-oh. '

  body: "An approach for a troublesome S in FontLab:\r\n\r\nAdjusting Bezier handles
    can be really useful for designing some letters but when designing an S, they
    can get in the way. They tend to take over the design and you might end up whittling
    it down to a really boring S that might not fit with the rest of your font; compromises
    made to please the Bezier gods.\r\n\r\nTry building it out of straight lines.
    Use the polygon tool and draw a blocky S . . . maybe around 20 points. Take a
    guess at the sidebearings, bring up a metrics windows, type words containing S
    and adjust sizes of the windows to you can see how your adjustments look in the
    context of words. Move the points around to make the best 20 point chunky S you
    can. Experiment with a fatter or thinner spine as opposed to trying to match the
    stem width precisely . . . do it by eye. No measuring allowed for S design. Take
    a lot of time on this stage, a good 20 point S isn't as easy as it might sound.\r\n\r\nOnce
    you're happy with the way it looks in context of the rest of the font you can
    start adding more points and bumping them around too. Keep looking at the way
    it looks in the metrics window while you're working. Often I'll add a point, select
    it, then keep my eyes on the metrics windows while playing bongos on the arrow
    keys. After about 50 points you can really start to refine the shape.\r\n\r\nThrow
    it on the mask layer and use that as a guide to build your S. The bowls are similar
    to what you've already done with some of the other letters. The spine is the tricky
    part. There's no right answer as to where you need to place the control points.
    The hardest part is getting the spine to blend into the bowls. That's why having
    that sketch on the mask layers is so critical. Take your time: S is the toughest
    letter. Tougher than X . . . sometimes."
