  next page. I am looking at a reproduction of a page from George Herbert's volume
  of poetry The Temple (the 1633 edition). At the bottom right corner of page 30 is
  the word \"Then,\" sitting all by itself, and at the top of the next page is the
  line \"Then let each houre.\"\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a technical
  name for this word at the bottom right corner?\r\n2. Is this ever used in contemporary
  book design?"

    use of several words ... could that be the source of the term catch phrase?"

  body: "The ever-helpful Online Etymology Dictionary traces \"catch phrase\" back
    to a political meaning of \"catchword\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=catchphrase&allowed_in_frame=0\r\n\r\nThe
    interesting thing about catchwords is that they would often match the font and
    size of the word on the next page, within reason. So even at the bottom of a page
    of roman text, the catchword could be set in a large blackletter (perhaps even
    a second ink color) if it's the first word of a large blackletter heading on the
    next page. So the word actually matched very closely to how it appeared on the
    next page."
