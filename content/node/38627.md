  \"National\" sans family.  It is destined to be a real workhorse sans with plenty
  of weights and features to take on all sorts of work. It looks pretty solid to me

  body: "Congratulations to Kris!\r\n\r\nI prefer National to other recent types I
    have seen that aim at reviving the flavor of 19th century English and American
    grotesques. The others are often too quirky looking to my eyes. National has the
    human feel and charm of the old grotesques, with more balance. Franklin Gothic,
    also a regularization of 19th century grotesques, is also not quirky and is well
    balanced, but is more formal. So National offers a contemporary, alternative with
    a nice charm and balance."

  body: "Major props, Kris, a huge achievement.\r\nAnd congratulations to Chester
    Jenkins and Village as well, for the \"big league\" vision of what a typeface
    can be, in the styles, weights, features and languages that it supports.\r\nDoes
    National represent the Village encoding standard?\r\nI note that H&FJ have an
    encoding standard, Latin-X\u2122.\r\nIt seems that with the graphic elements,
    National could be WGL4, with Cyrillic and Greek added.\r\n\r\nSome observations:\r\n\r\n19th-century
    flavour, certainly, but two some distinction:\r\n1. The capitals are small and
    light compared to the older sans faces: if National's caps were increased in size
    to ascender height, that height conformity, and the added weight contrast with
    lower case it would create, would be more like a 19C sans. In this respect, National
    follows the \"Helvetica\" paradigm of a smoothing out of cap/lc contrast.\r\n2.
    The tailed \"l\" is, AFAIK, a 20th-century trend in sans faces. Interestingly,
    its curvyness harmonizes well with the rounded forms in National's \"geometric\"
    stylistic alternate, where one might have supposed that a straight l would be
    more minimally geo. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the stylistic alternate included:
    I wonder at what point a separate style emerges, both from a categorical perspective,
    and from a product perspective. Recently, Neutra has been extended to create Neutra
    2, by changing a few characters. yet Hypatia and National, for instance, incorporate
    the alternate face as a Stylistic Set (or so I deduce from the National PDF) within
    one typeface, with the grotesque as the default and the geometric as the alternate.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks you all for your very kind words! A few answers:\r\n\r\n<cite>Does
    National represent the Village encoding standard?</cite>\r\n\r\nI am not too sure
    about that. I know Chester has an extensive encoding for his own work, and that
    is being added to & refined. I basically use whatever is his latest. \r\n\r\n<cite>1.
    The capitals are small and light compared to the older sans\u2026more like a 19C
    sans</cite>\r\n\r\nYeah, some interesting observations there. The National blurb
    says it \"travels through, and touches on, a lot of historical material, it is
    designed to thrive in our modern typographic climate.\" I really wanted a sans
    that was relatively contemporary, not a slavish revival, with anachronisms like
    enormous, dark capitals. That might also explain the 'l' tail as well!\r\n\r\n<cite>But
    why separate OT fonts for small caps?</cite>\r\n\r\nEverything is in one font
    file, believe me! As a user, I cannot stand to have separate font files. I think
    Chester has done this to show that there are small caps for all styles. \r\n\r\n<cite>Yeah,
    esp considering the Dollar is at an alltime low vs the Euro ; ). 250 USD = 173
    EUR.</cite>\r\n\r\nI quite like the quip at the top of the vllg.com site that
    says \"our dollar is weak but our types are strong!\".\r\n\r\n<cite>Best thing
    from NZ since the Chills. Well done!</cite>\r\n\r\nWoah! That is an enormous compliment
    Fredrik\u2014not too sure if it is entirely justified, but thanks all the same!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ahhh National. I have to say I am rather sad to have it released after having
    it all to my self for about a year. I was testing this baby from before it even
    had a percent glyph, kerning, rounded punctuation or even the subtle ink traps.
    It seems strange how a typeface can grow like that.\r\n\r\nI think the first thing
    to draw me to National was the extra bold weights, I thought they were slightly
    mad. I loved using the heaver weights in titles, headings and as such (and I loved
    how the tail of the lowercase 'a' remains from book to extra bold).\r\nSo I loved
    using National in larger text settings.\r\n\r\nBut now I'm appreciating the regular
    weights a lot more, National hides really well in longer text, but still has that
    warmth in the character to make the read interesting. \r\nIt works better in text
    than I thought it could.\r\n\r\nSo its become my studios little work horse. Always
    does its job as long as you treat it well (correct line length, 'actual' superiors
    nice rag and so on...), so look after it!\r\n\r\nGood stuff Sowersby, make some
    more cool type! Go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/National-1_4395.jpg]"
