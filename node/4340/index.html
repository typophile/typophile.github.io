		<div class="commentbody">The only folks I know who have done work with truly randomizing glyph selection are LettError, with FF Kozmik. <a href="http://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html</a> <BR> <BR>However, FF Kozmik is not a handwriting font, but hand-printing. <BR> <BR>Several handwriting fonts have been developed that use elaborate contextual rules which produce a variable effect similar to randomness, though in fact it is deterministic. One is Linotype&#39;s Zapfino, in the AAT TrueType version of the font that ships with Mac OS X. I am having difficulty finding a good link to something that explains its contextual goodies, however. <BR> <BR>Two other contextual-letterform type families are Caflisch Script Pro &#40;Robert Slimbach after Max Caflisch&#41; and Bickham Script &#40;Richard Lipton after George bickham&#41;. These two are in OpenType format, and can display their functionality in applications such as Illustrator CS and InDesign. By way of example, Caflisch Script Pro has 12 different forms for the lowercase &#34;p,&#34; and picks one depending on the context. <BR> <BR>For more information on OpenType, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</a>.

Assuming you want it to work in some existing applications, you have an unexciting choice insofar as each approach is very limited in how/where it works: <BR> <BR>- OpenType &#40;contextual, WYSIWYG, currently only supported by Adobe&#39;s apps, any output device, easiest to code but that&#39;s not saying a lot, use FontLab or maybe DTL FontMaster to make it&#41; <BR> <BR>- AAT &#40;contextual, WYSIWYG, Mac only, currently only supported by a handful of apps, any output device, hard to code contextual stuff, use Apple&#39;s command-line tools to compile the features into a pre-existing font&#41; <BR> <BR>- Type 1 &#40;true random, non-WYSIWYG, will work in many apps but not most recent Adobe apps, will only work with PostScript output devices, you&#39;d probably have to be a programmer to code it&#41; <BR> <BR>I hope that helps clarify your choices, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">if i understand correctly <a href="http://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/technote.html" target="_blank"> FF Kosmik</a> produces a &#34;random effect&#34; by cycling through a series of three related fonts with alternate glyphs. Kosmik uses postscript programming. I played around one weekend and tried to create the same effect using open type programming, but i&#39;m no programming whiz, so i haven&#39;t figgered it out yet. I was opperating on the following premise &#40;which may be faulty as well since logic is not my forte either&#41; have three sets of glyphs for each character: class A, class B &amp; class C. Define the OT substitution rules so that AA becomes AB BB becomes BC CC becomes CA, ad nauseum &#40;infinitum, whatev!&#41; Supposing i could get the programming right would this work???

Moving beyond, this process, once formalized, could be used to design fonts which are not mimics of handwriting, but something else again. <BR> <BR>And secondly: If one wanted to mimic the inconsistent quality of letterpress type, which is admirable when subtle, giving it life, rather than the dull predictability of high-res digital type, then one could arrange a &#34;type tray&#34; of glyphs, where each character has variants that are &#34;worn&#34; differently, or &#34;print&#34; differently &#40;simulating arterfacts in paper or printing&#41;, and selected at random. <BR> <BR>And is there not an element of randomness &#40;effected by a lack of total control&#41; in the design variants that occur between different type sizes in foundry type? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Constantin, I would explore randomness if the tools I use made it possible, or if I was a programmer. But like most type designers, that&#39;s not the case. <BR> <BR>The OpenType format, with its ability to contain mutliple glyphs for a single character, can be used to give the appearance of the randomness you seek, by assigning different glyph variants of the same character according to the adjacent character &#40;i.e. with &#34;invisible ligatures&#34;&#41;. However, it is only since last year that the Mac version of Fontlab that does OpenType has been introduced, so give it a little more time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What Hrant meant is &#40;I guess&#41;: consciously implemented randomness is not true randomness. In practice, for type stuff, I don&#39;t think it makes much difference, but it&#39;s an important distinction anyway. <BR> <BR>Not directly related, but <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/random.html?pg=1"> here</a> is something interesting about randomness.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks a lot for the link to randomness. it was very helpful. having read that article i must realise that i was not using the right word. looking at the definition of randomness i must actually use the word variation. i sometimes dont find the right terminology because english is not my first language. nonetheless i am very happy to have gotten such great inputs from you guys and would appreciate even more. </div>
