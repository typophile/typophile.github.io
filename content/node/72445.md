  the forums here has me so discouraged, however. I feel like there is an insurmountable
  amount of information about type and type history to digest, I don't even know where
  to begin to prepare! I once tried to design a typeface for a school project but
  it wasn't very good (I think I was just trying to rip off Archer in a haphazard
  way). I love programming (Python!!!), and I love typefaces and want to create them,
  so KABK seems like a dream. \r\n\r\nHere's what I'm trying to do so far:\r\n>Learning
  right-handed penmanship (I'm a lefty)\r\n>Just finished reading The Stroke & LetterLetter\r\n>Reading
  these forums semi-religiously\r\n\r\nAnyway, some advice is welcome. Encouragement
  would be nice :)"

    you see the requirements as \"an insurmountable amount of information... to digest\"
    just forget about it now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Type and Media program is open to a wide range of applicants, usually
    each year has a range of students from those who have released typefaces, to those
    who have never done and calligraphy or even used FontLab much. I'm not saying
    it is easy to get it, I think they do look for those that show solid typography
    skills as well as knowledge of type history.\r\n\r\nMy classmate Ondrej along
    with a number of other Type and Media students in the past have done calligraphy
    with their left hand. Calligraphy is only practiced often near the beginning of
    the course and while quality penmanship is encouraged, I think the primary focus
    of the calligraphy lessons is to pick up a sensitivity towards spacing (the balance
    of positive and negative space).\r\n\r\nSo I do encourage you to apply, it can't
    hurt ... I am aware of a few people who had to try a few times to get in, there
    are many applicants for only 11 spots. In the meantime I do encourage you to read
    as much as you can about type history and delve deeper into areas that interest
    you."
