  identification matched the first closest to <strong><em>[[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=116262|Praxis
  Bold]]</em></strong>, except I think it needs to be thicker and with a lower \"a\".\r\n\r\nThe
  second one, after some heavy tweaking, matched close to having the exact same ampersand
  (the \"&\" character) as <strong><em>[[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Hedley&q=Go|Hedley]]</em></strong>
  (too short endings, though...). And I think the capital i's are slanted for this
  one."
