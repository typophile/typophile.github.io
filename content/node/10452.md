  is most interesting. <BR> <BR>For obvious reasons, the following would be a great
  case-study at Typophile: <BR> <BR>Miller was worked on by Matthew Carter, Tobias
  Frere-Jones and Cyrus Highsmith. Could we possibly get some insight into the dynamics,

    Not that the end result needs to be a highly useful font or anything, but at least
    the process should have some educational value. <BR> <BR>And remember this proverb:
    <BR>If it takes one programmer one day to write a piece of code, it takes two
    programmers two days to write it... <BR> <BR>Not to cast an ominous cloud on this,
    but to me the ideal such project would involve like 10-20 designers, and take
    about a year. It would also require great flexibility of the participants, as
    well as a lot of communication. Last but not least: and one central &#34;authority&#34;.

    think splitting it by character could only result in a grunge font. Maybe we should
    do it by &#34;task&#34; instead, like: lc, UC, numerals, spacing, hinting, trapping,

    Here&#39;s a rough proposal: <BR> <BR>1. Appoint an Overall Authority: this person
    will have final say in everything, without necessarily participating in the design,
    or even explicitly offering his/her opinion. The three qualities this person must
    have in abundance are: an understanding of type design; fairness; a willingness
    to allow -even motivate- people to make something he personally might not like.
    <BR> <BR>2. Decide the general nature of the typeface. Is it a grotesque sans,
    a joined script, a Garalde, what? Once this is decided, some people will want
    to participate in the design, and others won&#39;t. <BR> <BR>3. Make a list of
    tasks that a type designer does, with as many subdivisions as we have participants.
    <BR> <BR>4. Define the Pert-chart, which is basically the sequential dependence
    of the various tasks &#40;eg: Kerning comes after Spacing&#41;. Also define how
    the various tasks are related &#40;eg: the rough spacing is done by the person
    doing &#91;some of&#93; the letterforms, but the final spacing is done afterwards
    by somebody else; or that the person doing the Kerning has to spend some &#34;quality
    time&#34; with the guy who did the Spacing&#41;. <BR> <BR>5. Assign each sub-task
    to an individual, make sure everybody&#39;s communicating with who he/she needs
    to communicate with, and manage the project to completion. <BR> <BR>6. Become
