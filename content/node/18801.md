  body: It does look sort of like this or that, but I don't see any matches. I think
    it could be custom drawn, given the time it's from. It's only two letters, after
    all.

  body: The reason I don't think it's based on Tiffany is the square ends on the serifs.
    Tiffany has round ends on the serifs. Otherwise, I agree there is some similarity.
    The top of the f is very similar to Poster Bodoni (a.k.a. Ultra Bodoni), but the
    bracketed serifs and the top of the i are very not Bodoni. It also has some similarity
    to very bold Caslons, but the top of the f is not like Caslon at all.

      looking for the exact precise match (which might not exist), Tiffany is a pretty
      good alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\nby the way, here's a somewhat better look at it,
      where you clearly see that the serifs are square unlike Tiffany.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/if-poster.jpg]"

    remember seeing a \"more fonts like this\" option link at Myfonts, but when you
    click on that for the Tiffany family, *you would not believe* the mish-mash that
    is brought up, including graffiti fonts.\r\nSo much for that bright idea.\r\n:
