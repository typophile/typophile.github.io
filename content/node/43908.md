  it and viola! \r\n\r\nI can't fix this other font however, it just shows a lot of

  body: "I had the exact same problem:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/43199\r\n\r\nKakaze
    (chris) gave me some good advice there:\r\n\r\nThis occurs sometimes when you
    add/delete a lot of fonts from OS X. The best way to solve the problem, without
    having to hunt down the offending font and delete it, is to clean your font caches.
    Font Finagler will do it 10 times for you before you have to pay for it and FontExplorerX
    will do it for you completely for free.\r\n\r\nAny time you have a weird font
    problem\u2014when this problem happens usually the text is completely illegible;
    like opening up a data file in a text editor\u2014the first thing to try is cleaning
    your caches.\r\n"
