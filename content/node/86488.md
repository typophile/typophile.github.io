body: Saw this in a clothing catalogue; the roman version was not used anywhere. The
  lowercase "w" caught my attention.

  body: Certainly looks like Didot, I agree, but a version designed for small text,
    as my sample has much less contrast than the classic Didot. Anyone know of a Didot
    (perhaps not actually named Didot) optimized for body text composition?

  body: I'd forgotten about the H&F-J Didot with optical sizes. Thanks for pointing
    that out.
