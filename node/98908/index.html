A number of oddities are to possibly add liveliness: different stroke thicknesses (horizontal), open/closed parts, asymetries.

Now, a first look at the entire ABC:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To me this looks very promising — a font I would be greedy to add to my library even without having any serious use for it, just for its prettiness. However (and as a layman I find it nerve-wrecking to articulate any criticism) there are a few glyphs that don&rsquo;t quite convince me.</p>
<ul> <li> X and Z seem in doubt whether or not to look top-heavy like K and R; to me they look a bit unstable as they are now;
<li> Y stands out as the only glyph to have an angular bystroke, which I find puzzling;
<li> IJ to me looks less like an IJ than as an alternative glyph for U — it would be less confusing with either a shortened I-shape or a J-shape with a real descender (by the way, that curved J-shape would be a lovely alternative glyph for the straight one);
<li> Œ looks like an O that comes speeding from the right; Æ has more or less a similar effect. Of course this font does not aim for a maximum legibility, but still...
<li> I am not sure if the four different heights of the middle bar in E, F, G and H might not be a bit too much of a good thing; especially the middel bar of Æ being lower than E's or Œ's might be reconsidered.
</ul> All these reservations are of course to be taken with a healthy dose of salt...
All best, Bart

tank you very much for your thoughtful comments. I’ll consider them.
A few remarks, however:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X and Z seem in doubt …
You’re most certainly right, at least with the Z.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Y stands out …
Yes. But the Y is the only letter having an angular mainstroke, which is unavoidable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IJ to me looks less like an IJ than as an alternative glyph for U …
I admitt I struggled a bit with this. You see in the sample that I even try another solution for the lc position (all lc positions will bear smaller caps, btw.). We will see …</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Œ looks like an O that comes speeding from the right …
Oh MY GOODNESS – it does! 
Perhaps something is to be done with the crossing bit in the centre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now some more little previews. 
There will be 5 weights altogether:</p>

<p>The initial views were of the Regular, now these shots are from the middle one, the Medium.

<p>And, last but not least, there will also be some fancies available:</p>

If you don&rsquo;t want that end reconnecting, perhaps it should stay the same distance from the stroke, i.e. keep the white between more even in width.</div>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t argue that way. I’d rather say, the stroke topography of both the R’s and the Eszett’s right part is essentially different from the Y. I still don’t see a possible other solution for the Y.

<blockquote>

<p>I considered and think, I best leave the exclam and the question marks in that simple fashion. I don’t want them to become too grave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IJ …
well, see the new take on it. I also changed the Œ and I feel that this solution is better.
I also did a new approach to the zero figure. Wasn’t quite satisfied with it (previous versions in light grey).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/a-typo3-1_5423.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Thanks for your kind words about those figures; I found them rather cumbersome to make.
Well, the 1 and the 4 are quite nice …
– In that sample you also see a 1st view of the Italic.</p>
<p>And, as to the narrowings of the bystrokes: there is a shortcoming of rendition in rough screen display, of course. Even on one single machine, depending on the application: you get different results. In the sample below (from the Mac): TextEdit – rather thicky (top); PDF view – more crisp (bottom).
Admittedly, this is going to be a face for sizes rather beyond 36p. And more for the print than the screen.
I still feel that the stroke scheme ought be as it is now.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/a-typo3-2-goth_5786.png" alt=""></p>
<p>– Further comments welcome.</p>

you’ve spotted the tricky edge of it. The few letters whith slanted parts (A, Y, N, M…) do somehow not fit entirely into the model. – In that version I also changed the middle height parts positions of E and F. Found them distracting in the first take. 
There will also be a serifed version:
