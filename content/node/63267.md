  sans-serif. Ideally it would be something pretty geometric -- I'm looking for a
  round \"O\" to complement the mark. Also, I would prefer something with a single-story
  lowercase \"a.\" Right now I'm actually considering using Futura. It's definitely
  geometric, but it doesn't come off as very warm or personable.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help!\r\nMatt"

    love to hear your suggestions, but I think might have solved my own dilemma with
    Avenir. I decided that single-story \"a\" in Futura was actually hurting the friendlieness-factor.

    Cooke and Jos Buivenga in the replies is incredible - I'm familiar with your work
    and have high regard for both of you. Although, I must admit I wasn't aware Museo
    had a complementing sans-serif! I'll definitely keep that in mind for future projects.
    And Frode, thank you for your generous reply. Your willingness to open up a custom
    type to me is really, really kind. It looks spectacular.\r\n\r\nI almost feel
    like I'm letting you guys down\u2026 our team just came together behind Avenir
    today. I really appreciate the input, though!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt"
