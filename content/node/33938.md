  body: I was going to suggest the same collection, but also you can also achieve
    a punk effect by using really simple sans from that era (Futura, Franklin Gothic,
    etc) and black, white, red, hot pink. Stay away from any contemporary fonts and
    any fancy typesetting tricks. Those were the cut and paste days. DIY.

  body: I've even set my type before in, say, Impact or something (or, as pattyfab
    suggests, Franklin Gothic -- very 70s), 14pt, printed it, distressed it manually,
    and blown it up via xerox to emphasize the divets.

    the only one. Actually it was pretty diverse body of graphic work. Whatever it's
    roots might have been I think it evolved a recognizable feeling just because of
    the techniques/means employed. At least for quite a while. By 83-85 I think the
    urge to inject some polish back in became overwhelming.\r\n\r\nInteresting Note

    miss cut and paste but I miss the attitude.\r\n\r\nWho says the attitude is over?
    I was talkiing about the lifestyle, which was over for a lot of people very quickly.\r\n\r\nI
    perceive it as a lot of outsiders (for many different reasons) that gathered together
    for that reason - we didn't fit in anywhere else. That lead to a lot of self-destructive
    behavior and a lot of dead people - at least in LA, NY, and SF - locations I am
    most familiar with.\r\n\r\nBeing an outsider is really hard Patty, it's a strength
    and a tremendous burden. You have to be a supreme egotist for it not to hurt.
    I'm still an outsider but have learned how to deal, unlike a lot of my friends
    who aren't here anymore\u2026\r\n\r\nArtistically speaking there were 2 schools
    - the glam school (Bowie, The New York Dolls, Andy Warhol, Iggy, etc\u2026) and
    the avant garde school (Sun Ra, Mauricio Kagel, Stockhausen (even if he was a
    puppet of the state like John Cage pronounced) The Art Ensemble of Chicago, Mr.
    Cage himself, etc\u2026). I belonged to the latter and had stopped listening to
    rock and roll when Spiders From Mars came out. From there it was into jazz and
    avant garde classical music. There was great music that was generated from both
    camps and that was part of the fun. The glamsters thought we were really weird
    and we thought they were really lame and we were both partially right\u2026 :)\r\n\r\npeace"

    but as a friend of mine who was there for the duration (actually even further
    back, he was part of the factory scene) said, where's the underground today? Two
    republican mayoral administrations have driven it so far down you can't really
    find it anymore.\r\n\r\nI guess that's what I miss - and I was around for the
    NY part of the punk scene - the ability to experiment and live an alternative
    lifestyle. Very difficult in today's economy. Not to mention the collaboration,
    cross-pollination btw the different arts.\r\n\r\nYou really didn't include in
    your roundup the NY side of things, or the anarchist school. I designed a great
    book called The  Downtown Book that has a lot of graphics from '74 to '84."

    It may have been idealism flipped on its head, but idealism it was.\r\n\r\nI think
    there are young idealists out there, but if they create something real it is co-opted
    so fast by the media that the life is sucked out instantly. Part of the reason
    punk worked is that it got to stay separate from \"reality\" for awhile - there
    was absolutely no chance to make it (unless you were a poseur like Patty Smith,
    Talking Heads, Blondie or The GoGos - probably get slaughtered for this statement).\r\n\r\nIt
    was crazy noise made by crazy people. Love it. But there is one thing that absolutely
    drives me crazy and that is reflecting on that time period like it was better
    than now. That's just not punk.\r\n\r\npeace"
