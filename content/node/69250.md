  help. I'm working on my personal portfolio and obviously have to create an ID for
  myself as a motion graphics designer. I've more or less decided on the following:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.midmotion.com/m_bw.gif]]\r\n\r\nBut
  I've worked myself into a corner, perhaps because of the line weight of the logo.
  I can't figure out what I should do with the type at this point, or even whether
  it should be an extension of the logo or at the bottom.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  any ideas for a suitable typeface?"
