body: "I am trying to design a book for a customer.  It's non-fiction, perhaps one
  or two images, otherwise it's text with maybe two levels of hierarchy.  The body
  text alternates between quoting from an old religious text and explanatory comments.
  \ Sometimes these alternations stretch over a page or more, sometimes they're only
  a line or two.\r\n\r\nFor the body text, the latest proposal was to alternate between
  normal and italic of the same type and weight, a solution which I found comfortable
  to read.  Setting the old religious text a little \"poem style\" (indented, italic,
  ragged right) and the explanatory comment as just reading text (no indent, normal,
  justified) I found quite pleasing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the client insists on using a
  bold weight for the old religious text, mixed with normal weight for the commentary.
  \ I find it more and more difficult to argue why I would avoid a bold face.  My
  latest comment to the client is this: <em>Bold faces are frowned upon for reading.
  \ Anywhere I look, the sprinkling of bold faces into reading text is labeled as
  a \"type crime\" because it \"blotches\" the page and interrupts the reading comfort.
  \ Go into a bookstore, grab any of the books and you'll find that barely any one
  scatters bold faces into the flowing text.  If you mix bold and normal text, and
  hold an open book at a smaller distance you'll see black blobs, the \"blotches\"
  scattered across the pages.  This unbalances the text, brings it out of weight (that's
  why \"bold\" and \"normal\" and \"light\" are referred to as type weights).</em>\r\n\r\nIn
  your opinion and experience, how would you handle this situation?  Which arguments
  are there for and against mixing normal and bold face in reading text?"

  body: There are several gradations between roman and bold in the more elaborate
    font families. Show your client how the variations of roman/semibold, book/bold,
    book/semibold, etc, look and juxtapose with roman/bold. That should convince the
    client. If not, clench your teeth, do the job, delete your credit line and get
    on with your life.

  body: "I'd say that using italic and Roman in the fashion you describe provides
    a greater contrast than using bold/regular. Not in terms of typographic colour,
    of course, but in most other respects. It changes the mood and the voice completely,
    while boldface just dims the light.\r\n\r\nAnd you are in my opinion right about
    boldface for extended reading. Contrasting it with a regular weight would work
    against the intention, making the most important matter less accessible and pleasant
    to read than the commentary.  \r\n\r\nI agree that a modern (in the typographical
    sense) serif would be your best bet if the client still insists. It was Bodoni
    who invented boldface (though it wasn't very bold, and I don't think he used it
    for contrast), the bolds of earlier typefaces are modern inventions. Very rarely
    do they look good, in my opinion. Bold letters needs simple, clean shapes to work
    well, if readability is a goal. \r\n"

    emphasis is on a visual distinction between the old religious text and the explanatory

    for the customer a bold seems appropriately strong and distinct.\r\n\r\nBut alternatives

  body: "In addition to creating a blotchy appearance on the page, bold text has more
    visual emphasis than regular text within a block of copy. This conveys the impression
    that the bolded text is <strong>more important</strong> since it seems to speak
    louder.\r\n\r\nItalic text, on the other hand, has the same overall visual color
    as regular text and <em>simply suggests a distinction</em> without implying anything
    about relative importance.\r\n\r\nJudging only from you post and not having seen
    the work, I think your client wants you to do something that will not only be

    the religious text in a box, sidebar, different color, on a tinted background,
    or some other treatment might visually separate it without the use of bold. (The
    use of color would add to the printing costs but I've seen that technique used

    on the 'fineness' of said process, which will certainly be an issue (for crispness)
    at normal text sizes.

    Electra Roman for the voice of one narrator and Electra Italic for the other.
    \r\nWhen W.A. Dwiggins designed Electra in 1935, he drew the Italic as a slanted
    version of the Roman letterforms, not cursive. (This was a radical idea at the
    time, and Mergenthaler later insisted that Dwiggins draw a conventional Italic,
    which they released in 1944 as Electra Cursive.) In <em>Birdy</em>, Knopf paired
    Dwiggins' original Electra Italic with Electra Roman, so that readers could easily
    spot the difference but wouldn't have to wade through page after page of cursive
    letterforms. \r\nIf you can find a hardcover edition of <em>Birdy</em> (maybe
    your local library has one), you could show it to your client to demonstrate that
    an obliqued Roman might work better than bold as a contrasting text face. (Don't
    show them the mass-market paperback--that uses a cursive Italic for the second
