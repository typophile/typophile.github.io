    Fool's joke, or are you really going to continue to create such absurd performance
    art?"

  body: Since when is an iPod required to get podcasts? These actually work on ANY
    portable player. It's really easy to install them. Subscribe via iTunes or any
    other podcast receiver that you're using and you get all updates automatically.

    show in the early 1990s, and devoted an entire show to playing and commenting
    on different recordings of 4\u203233\u2033. Very, very funny. 'Ah, now this version
