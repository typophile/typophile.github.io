body: 'I&#39;ve often completed all the spacing and kerning on a typeface and when
  I get all done realize there are far too many kern pairs for a specific character
  in the font. <BR> <BR>That conclusion leads me to believe that I have poorly spaced
  the right sidebearing of the character and I often wish for some tool I could use
  to merge spacing and kerning data to yield the least amount of kerns. <BR> <BR>I
  call this concept &#34;Flatten Kerning&#34; similar to flattening an image in Photoshop.
  However I do not have the technical ability to create such an application but feel
  it could be very simple if I knew how to implement something that would work with
  a .met file from FOG. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s my real life example to illustratrate
  the need for this tool: <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s say I&#39;ve exported the spacing and
  kerning file from FOG and this is all the data it tells me about my &#39;o&#39;
  character. <BR> <BR>o a -65 kern <BR>o b -25 kern <BR>o c -5 kern <BR>o d -45 kern
  <BR>o e -5 kern <BR>o f -10 kern <BR>o g -5 kern <BR>o h -10 kern <BR>o i -5 kern
  <BR>o j -50 kern <BR>o k -5 kern <BR>o l -5 kern <BR>o m -5 kern <BR>o n -5 kern
  <BR>o o -10 kern <BR>o p -25 kern <BR>o q -5 kern <BR>o r -25 kern <BR>o s -15 kern
  <BR>o t -25 kern <BR>o u -5 kern <BR>o v -65 kern <BR>o w -60 kern <BR>o x -45 kern
  <BR>o y -15 kern <BR>o z -35 kern <BR> <BR>As you can see due to not getting the
  spacing right, I have a kern pair for almost every lowercase instance. <BR> <BR>If
  I look at my right sidebearing, it&#39;s 10 which tells me if I take it to 5 I can
  kill off 10 kern pairs from the font as well as reduce the kerning for the remaining
  pairs for my &#39;o&#39; <BR> <BR>o a -60 kern <BR>o b -20 kern <BR>o d -40 kern
  <BR>o f -5 kern <BR>o h -5 kern <BR>o j -45 kern <BR>o o -5 kern <BR>o p -20 kern
  <BR>o r -20 kern <BR>o s -10 kern <BR>o t -20 kern <BR>o v -60 kern <BR>o w -55
  kern <BR>o x -40 kern <BR>o y -10 kern <BR>o z -30 kern <BR> <BR>I could do this
  process manually but I think it could be automated with some sort of program. <BR>
  <BR>Some problems come to mind . . . <BR> <BR>First, the metrics file only contains
  the width of the character which means it&#39;d be difficult to determine the sidebearings
  of the character. <BR> <BR>Second, what to make of left sidebearings since the case
  may be such that the left sidebearing could be causing the creation of a ton of
  kerning pairs when all it needs to be is fixed. <BR> <BR>I am excited to hear your
  thoughts and comments about this and please don&#39;t tell me FL already does this,
  I&#39;m looking for a solution that will work for FOG. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D'

  body: Maybe you&#39;re already doing this, but I think the thing to do is get into
    the habit of getting the spacing to work without kerning first and after it&#39;s
    just right, then tackle the problem pairs with kerning.  <BR> <BR>As to whether
    what you suggest is possible, it does seem like the sort of thing RoboFOG can
    do &#40;although I don&#39;t use it&#41;.

  body: Mark is right, RoboFog can probably be scripted to do this &#40;or FontLab?&#41;,
    but I wouldn&#39;t know how either. Even after spending a lot of time spacing,
    there&#39;s inevitably something wrong that reveals itself when you look at the
    AFM. It&#39;s always a back-and-forth situation for me. <BR> <BR>For what it&#39;s
    worth, I created a FileMaker database that imports an AFM file, and allows you
    to do all kinds of operations on specific kinds of kerning pairs. You could say
    &#34;take all kern pairs where &#39;o&#39; is the first letter and reduce them
    by 10. Also take all the pairs where &#39;v&#39; is the second character, and
    change the &#39;v&#39; to a &#39;w&#39;. Then do a global adjust of -5% on the
    whole tamale.&#34; That sort of thing. <BR> <BR>Let me know if you are interested
    in having it &#40;you have to have FileMaker to run it, I&#39;m sorry to say&#41;.

  body: Stuart - <BR> <BR>As much as I&#39;m interested in your proposal for merging
    the kerning, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s really the issue. The issue is over kerning.
    Many of the pairs you&#39;ve listed in your message are not pairs that would traditionally
    need kerning &#40;of course there are exceptions, especially with an irregular
    design&#41;. I would look at the spacing before altering the kerning in some way.
    Many times if the spacing isn&#39;t solid, the kerning pairs will snowball.

  body: I agree with you, and in fact, I threw away all of the kerning and start over
    with spacing and dramatically killed off most of the kerning. <BR> <BR>As per
    Alan suggestion, it&#39;s nice to know there are other font designers who have
    the same thoughts about this.
