  wondering if anybody can spot small or large issues with any of it. I know such
  a discussion would help me greatly improve my own Greek and Cyrillic skills, so
  I hope you won't be shy!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a small latin letter v.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"/files/nu20130704_6279.png\">\r\n\r\n*And

    with Gerry Leonidas, Senior Lecturer in Typography at the University of Reading.
    For Whitney, Leonidas advocated the adoption of two distinct formal vocabularies
    for the Latin and Greek ends of the type family, an approach supported by the
    unique characteristics of the Greek language.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI took that
    to mean the drawing skills were H&FJ, the thinking was Leonidas. Could be wrong,
    of course. Anyway, reading what Mr. Leonidas has to say generally could only be
    helpful..."

    something it would simply help me decide which way I might go myself.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
