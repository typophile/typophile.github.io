  either of these look like any existing fonts? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tftds_3837.jpg]
  \r\n\r\nI know there is a good chance that these were custom made just for the logos,
  but even if so I wonder if anyone has created a a font based on these since then?
  \r\n\r\nThanks for any help!"
