body: "After dropping off my son at daycare on Monday morning, I took a big gulp of
  coffee, did that interlocking-finger-knuckle-cracking-thing, and sat down at my
  computer, ready to get some work done. Instead, I checked Twitter. Of course, my
  feed was immediately confronted with the week\u2019s latest distraction (NSFW),
  a Tumblr entitled [[http://fonts-n-boobs.tumblr.com|Fonts & Boobs]].\r\n\r\nThe
  concept is pretty simple. Combine a \u2018high-quality\u2019 typeface with a picture
  of a \u2018cute chick\u2019. Oh yeah, and she\u2019s basically naked and positioned
  in a variety of provocative poses. All of this is described by the Tumblr\u2019s
  author, as a \u2018useful tool for graphic designers\u2019. Right.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMy
  initial desire to punch someone in the face was quickly replaced with a quasi-rational
  thought: Is there a more nuanced relationship between fonts and boobs than this
  misogynist type nerd\u2019s wet dream? \r\n\r\nFonts and boobs. They\u2019re both
  beautiful. And functional. Both have lustful value beyond their intended purpose.
  A well-designed type specimen, like a manufactured image of a naked female model\u2019s
  breasts, is an ideal, an erotic fantasy. The type designer <em>hopes</em> their
  typeface will be as meticulously treated  as it is in the type specimen, replete
  with OpenType goodies, multiple weights and well-spaced justified alignment. In
  the hands of a typographic aficionado, the typeface is respected, revered, and handled
  with love. \r\n\r\nMaybe the world does need more type specimens with boobs, real
  boobs. Here's my contribution: [[http://fonts-n-breastfeeding.tumblr.com/|Fonts
  & Breastfeeding]]. Type is beautiful, functional and worthy of respect. So are breasts."

    can dig this. Even though frankly I'm relieved I'm not qualified.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    communication side of things this is just a cheap trick we know from selling cars
    and tyres. There\u2019s no wit in any of those posters, not to speak of erotic
    whatsoever. It\u2019s just cheap. Missed opportunity."
