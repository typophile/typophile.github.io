body: Hello, I'm looking for this typeface or something similar to that. I can't seem
  to identify it and it could very well not be a display type, it's just that I can't
  seem to pinpoint any tags for it. So sorry if I mislead someone. Thanks in advance.

    the initials are in a different typeface."

  body: Thanks, I know about the initials. But am looking for something similar to
    the narrow hybrid serif typeface. I'll take a look at what Letterhead has to offer.
    Thanks again.
