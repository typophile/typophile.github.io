body: "Hi! I'm designing a layered typeface with three weights and some extra glyphs
  (ligatures, swashes and some weird alternates). I made open type feature for ligatures
  and kerns but I let some extra glyphs without feature. When I use those glyphs and
  I change the weight, the glyph doesn't change. For example, if I write \"BARCELONA\"
  with one of my extra B's, and I change the weight, it change all the word except
  the B. \r\nI've been looking the generated file and it seems that those extra glyphs
  without feature doesn't have UICODE names, so when we change the weight, they doesn't
  change. I've tryied to use the option GLYPHS>GLYPHS NAME>GENERATE UNICODE but it
  doesn't work.\r\nAnyone knows what can I do to generate the same UNICODE names on
  the three weights.\r\nThanks for your help and sorry for my english!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Imagen-31_4053.jpg]"

  body: "You can assign Private Use Area codes to those glyphs. Or you make those
    glyphs OpenType alternates to existing glyphs: sub B by B.alt \r\nSo if you change
    the font, it can change to the respective B.alt in the new font or fall back to
    B if there is no B.alt."

  body: Thanks for your quick reply Ralph! Yes, I think the best option is to make
    some features, the problem is that I have three alternates of B, so I don't really
    know how to make it. Anyway, thank you so much.

  body: "Generally, I think the designer calls the glyphs B.alt1, B.alt2, etc. and
    on into private use unicode they go until the designer then assigns one alternate
    version of any character to each Opentype stylistic set, which are like a private
    features area. Then the designer, or their support, show/tell your users which
    stylistic set contains which alternate(s). The fonts are installed, and the stylistic
    sets then appear in menus familiar with opentype, where your users who listened
    or looked at a guide, can select which stylistic set to change the B to. \r\n\r\nI
    may sound harder than taking a train to Fiji, but it's pretty easy. \r\n\r\n "

  body: "<cite>he problem is that I have three alternates of B</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    not a problem. For example, check examples for the SALT and AALT feature. They
    are specifically meant to offer access to different alternates. \r\nYou can also
    distribute the alternates among the stylistic sets 1 to 20 as bbg mentioned. "

  body: "Well, with using stylistic sets, it can be like taking a train to Fiji. There
    are only 20 stylistic sets. If you want each set to control a single character
    alternate, and there are (for example) 3 variants each of 26 caps, you can't get
    there -- you run out of track at Arica...which looks like a lovely spot if you
    have Spanish & some money...\r\n\r\nFurther, I can't see how SALT will let you
    have individual control over which of three variants for however many caps...\r\n\r\nPrivate
    use encoding has it's own problems, but (forgive me) since yours doesn't seem
    like a font to be used for a multipurpose document, you could do that, and let
    the user hunt & peck from the glyph pallet. As long as you use the same Unicode
    number (in PU) for each variant across the weights, it should work."

  body: "The real problem here is lack of adequate application support. Any layout
    feature can, in theory, support type 3 one-to-one-of-many subsitutions, as Ralf
    suggests using with 'salt', but that in turn requires an application to be able
    to access enumerated GSUB variants.\r\n\r\nAs Charles notes, there are only 20
    stylistic sets, which is probably plenty for the intended use of those features,
    i.e. to access sets of related glyph variants, not variants of individual glyphs.
    For the latter, the Character Variant features exist, there are 100 of them and
    they are explicitly intended to be used with type 3 lookups, but that takes us
    back to where we are in the first paragraph: lacking appropriate application support.\r\n\r\nThe
    good news, such as it is, is that support for enumerated variants is built into
    CSS3's typography support, so this is an area in which browsers are leapfrogging
    existing layout apps. We built a font for Byzantine sigillography that makes extensive
    use of the character variant features, and its very cool to see it <a href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~jdaggett/tests/byzantineseal.html\">working
    in Firefox</a>."
