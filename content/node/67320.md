    a day, so I had to stop. I think the shape is wrong for my hand or something.
    \r\n\r\nI went back to the wired one with the scroll ball. The only down side
    to it is the ball stops working if you get it greasy (never eat potato chips while
    using), but a little alcohol on a tissue and it's as good as new."

    your hand hurt? I've found that I don't keep my entire hand on it all the time
    (also because if you inadvertently touch it, you go scrollin'around) and handle
    it very gently and lightly, which is a good thing in my case because I used to
    tense up my mouse hand too much. Took me a few days to readjust though."

  body: "<em> it puzzles me how it can make your hand hurt</em>\r\n\r\nIt seems to
    be because I keep wanting to hold my middle finger slightly above the surface
    instead of touching it, which causes a strain over time. I think the reason I
    do it is that I'm afraid I might accidentally right-click or something, even though
    I know that won't happen. I'm giving it another go, being careful to keep that
    finger relaxed and resting on the surface. So far so good.\r\n\r\nI have a similar
    problem using a Wacom tablet. The stylus makes parts of my hand go numb after
    an hour or so. It doesn't happen when I use a pen or pencil, so I'm not sure why
    it happens.\r\n\r\nHere's what my desktop looks like today:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marksdesk_5727.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy

  body: 'I eventually gave up on all mice as they all eventually ended up hurting
    my hands. Using a pen was even worse. I got into trackballs a few years ago. I
    tried Kensington, all the Logitech models. For a couple of years I used the low
    end Logitech with no scroll wheel. The Logicool cordless is a bad design, I tried
    for a few weeks but I could only use it for about 8 hours in a row. It''s a poor
    design because you have to take the weight off your hand when dragging: sore shoulders.
    Also, the ball doesn''t coast properly. For 50 cents I picked up a used Trackman
    Wheel. The ball''s coasting is the best I''ve tried. Using a thumb gives you about
    the same control as fingers and a proper scroll wheel. I don''t have to move my
    arm at all and the flick & coast action means, I can go all the way across. When
    I need to cross the screen from right to left, I can drop my thumb on the ball
    and spin it, then stop,catch when it''s in the right spot. Try it but save money
    and skip the Logicool cordless.'
