body: "We are branding a bank services company called 21st Century Financial Services
  or \"21CFS\" They provide back end data and transaction processing services to banks.
  They are the bank behind the bank so to speak. They desire to be a progressive company
  with new technologies and a unique nearly-paperless process. I am looking for a
  typeface that could be used in their mark as well as have a wide enough bredth to
  cover multi-medium usage. I have attached the first (extremely rough, I might add)
  draft of the logo ideations to help with your suggestions. Our initial thoughts
  are to look for a semi-serif or sans typeface (like Scala maybe), but I am open
  to suggestion. What are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nBeau"

  body: Do you really want ST to stand out that much? Also, now that the logo is 6
    around, maybe the base should have an incurve to match the out curve of the next
    one. It looks a bit awkward to me.

  body: The Swastika was based on a Mian Sun Symbol. As for the look its boring. I've
    seen it done a dozen times and better. First work on the letter spacing its pretty
    bad. And the symbol needs explaination or you could be a flower company

    the letter-spacing of \"21\" and the word-spacing of \"financial services\".\r\n-

  body: "Hi BeauSim>\r\n\r\nWhen I look at this logo... my brain immediately says
    \"credit union or real estate\". The brick red and slate gray used together are
    a soothing combination. The flower imparts warmth as well. While this is a good
    thing, in this context- I think not. The logo is very friendly and connotes maybe
    personalized service. But I think you are going in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nThe
    organic 'look' is not about strength and reliability. Its about warmth and the
    human aspect of things. \r\n\r\nSo where should you go?\r\n\r\nThere are fonts
    with a clinical feel, such as Univers- emotionless and used rampantly in corporate
    identities. Then there are fonts such as Manuscript- very rough and organic- not
    powerful. You need something in between... a humanist sanserif.\r\n\r\nYour initial
    idea of Scala is pretty good to me. But I wouldn't use that particular font. Its
    getting too much play these days and you want your logo to be unique for a very
    long time. I think the font for you is FF Absara Sans. Its powerful yet its forms
    are not so clinical that you can't convey 'the human' aspect.\r\n\r\nScala, Kievit,
    Charter, Dederon, Caspari, and Richmond are also nice choices. And genreally speaking
    FontFont has excellent fonts. Stay away from Dax, Meta, and Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI
    would also change the colors to be stronger... maybe blues or cardinal reds. More
    saturated. Something that gets your attention with out slapping you in the face.\r\n\r\nHope
    I'm helping you,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    than the ''flower''. I don''t like the second font at all, that R looks like it
    got hit by a car. I think a serif/sans combo like the first sample is a good way
    to go. It also gives you more options for the full identity. '

  body: I think this is much better than the first. I do think the centering of it
    all is too safe. I think it reminds me more of a flower than a swastika. Also,
    now that the swastika was mentioned earlier in regards to the first mark we are
    all a little bit conditioned to see it. Is this a medium or regular weight of
    this sans for the smaller type? The R is filling in at that size.

    get the Swastika feeling with this symbol, but it also depend very much with peoples
    life experinces etc. Anyway I made those proposals for Beau in like one hour,
    just to be able to test something different but yet similar to the initial idea.
    Letters etc has to be perfected and adjusted in a final stage.\r\n\r\nBtw. I had
    a look at your site. It's an impressive collection of books you have there ;-)"
