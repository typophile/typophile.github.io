      a big chunk of it in the past. Quark had a  really good chanse in the beginning
      and blew it big time! They just got lazy and fat from the initial sucess.

    their business model fast, or they are doomed.\r\n\r\nAlso, this looks quite a
    bit like the shape for Sterling Brands: http://www.sterlingbrands.com/ , not to

    While monopolies are never a good idea, they're making it easier for Adobe to
    snatch up their market share. InDesign is a much better product and when companies
    realize how much money they'll save (particularly smaller firms) by just buying
    Creative Suite, they'll be left in the dust. \r\n\r\nIf Quark wants to start anew,
    they need to set their price point for Xpress even lower and introduce programs
    that can compete with Adobe. One trick ponies don't last very long."

    name is that the P in XPress is capitalized.\r\nReally, Quark is such a good name
    (subatomic particles? oh yeah.), they don't have to worry about the logo.\r\nAs
    for the product, it still has a huge customer base, and people have been writing
    it off vs IndDesign (just like Apple vs Microsoft) for ages, and it ain't dead
    yet.\r\nBTW, Adobe's symbol is no great shakes, rather prosaic, looks like a character
    from the Stop typeface.\r\n "

  body: I think their new identity is just another example of how Quark underestimates
    the intelligence of their user-base. I think a rebranding was/is necessary, but
    they have to make real, and not just surface changes, both to their product, and
    how they deal with their users. Their recent print-campaign was ridiculous - a
    series of tightly cropped "funky" designers talking about how great Quark is -
    like we don't  what Quark does and doesn't do by now. "...Pride goes before a
    fall..."

  body: Can I ask you something. When Quark was the only player in town did they do
    anything to improve the product? My answer is no. So now InDesign is poised to
    be the only player in town and you feel confortable Adobe will continue to improve
    their product. I don't think so, unless there is competition. Don't kill Quark,
    make them compete. I don't use Quark I haven't since InDesign 1.5, but I want
    InDesign 4 to be tremendous not just average.
