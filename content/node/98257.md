  body: Thank you Jan. I kept thinking it was something like found on Signfonts.com
    (like this for example http://artandsignstudio.com/xtremescript.html), but with
    some adjustments. But you're thinking its completely drawn up in the raw?

    dates from 1981. If the poster is as old it isn\u2019t even digital type, so no
