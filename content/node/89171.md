  symbol (for email address) looks to be generic, and doesn't have the feel for the
  face, at large (a historical afterthought). Would there be any alternatives to this?
  Your suggestions are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    a more robust \u201CJenson\u201D.\r\n\r\nBTW, for a limited amount of text, e.g.
    stationery, you could borrow the @ from another font."

    version is far too light and definitely no good choice for small text sizes.'

    some of the best caps in town. (On the other hand\r\npersonally I think a large
    x-height is anathema to Jenson.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "My thoughts exactly. I've never been a fan of Iowan for that reason alone
    (but the caps are indeed lovely). Satyr is a bit taller in the x-height than the
    classical Jenson model too, but the much sturdier and less sloping top serifs
    makes the ascenders appear somewhat taller than they really are, when compared
    to those of a Venetian typeface. It is also optimised for ten points, not twelve
    or fourteen. Then again, Satyr is not a Venetian, it just shares a few traits.
    I'd say it belongs to the non-existing category Nordic Old-style, if any. \r\n\r\nAnyone
    know which size of Centaur was used for Monotype's digitisation, by the way? Why
    did it end up so disastrously thin and frail? Has anyone tried to redo it properly?
