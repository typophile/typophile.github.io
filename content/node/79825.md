  to be too silly\r\nI tried to look for something similar in your forum but I couldn't
  dig up anything...\r\n\r\nI'm manually kerning a typeface I designed.\r\nNow I'm
  nearly finished but I realized that the kerning values I gave to the glyphs are
  a bit too tight\r\nI was wondering if there was a way to automatically increase
  all the values by a given number (eg 20)\r\nIf possible I'd rather not touch the
  side bearings\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your time!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nmattia"

  body: "I think I've got a solution for you that works for adjusting an entire font's
    metrics or kerning at the same time in increments of your choosing.\r\n\r\n1.
    SAVE A COPY OF YOUR FONT AS THIS IS UNDOABLE. YOU WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE
    OLDER VERSION IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE RESULTS AND KEEP EXPERIMENTING UNTIL YOU LIKE
    THE RESULT.\r\n2. Select all glyphs with command-A.\r\n3. Go to Tools, Transform
    Range\r\n4. Under available actions:, click the arrow next to Metrics. 4-5 options
    come down. Click on and highlight Adjust Metrics.\r\n5. To the right of that you
    will see an arrow button. You must click that button next.\r\n6. In the window
    to the right that was blank, now appears \"Adjust metrics (0000) by 0 units\"\r\n7.
    In the window at the bottom also now appears a few options you can choose from.
    To adjust kerning, click the box next to kerning.\r\n8. To the right, where it
    says Adjust by: Click in the box and type a number like 10 or 20.\r\n9. Click
    Run.\r\n10. Keep trying until you get it the way you want. Remember to save different
    versions in case you change your mind later.\r\n\r\nI recommend you read \"Learn
    Fontlab Fast\". That's where I got this from."
