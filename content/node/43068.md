  anyone tell me how to make this a typeable path so i can type or add a name it will
  adjust the whole circle.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1stback_4024.gif]"

  body: "Cool I like it.\r\n\r\nAny way you do it is going to be a bit laborious.\r\nThis
    is what I'd do:\r\n\r\n\u2022 draw a line with the pen tool\r\n\u2022 duplicate,
    rotate and repeat the lines the same way you have done with your text.\r\n\u2022
    Then use 'type on a path' tool to start writing on one line and write more information
    than can fit into the single text box.\r\n\u2022 Deselect the type box and select
    the white arrow tool\r\n\u2022 Select the text box again and you should see a
    little box with a red plus indicating there's more info than can fit in the text
    box.\r\n\u2022 using the white arrow tool, click on the red arrow and the cursor
    will change to show what looks like a tiny block of text\r\n\u2022 select the
    start of the next line and the overflow will run onto the next line \u2013 you
    can just repeat this all the way round the circle and every line will adjust when
    you change one detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\nIf you're really stuck send
    me your email address and I'll send you an ai file showing what I mean... or check
    out 'typing on a path' and 'linking path type' in help files.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\nEd\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeonapath_5810.png]"
