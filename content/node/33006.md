body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI've been fiddling around quite a while with this (it
  started in type battle #12 or #14, if I can remember), and I think now it's the
  right time for some feedback whether you like it or not...\r\n\r\nPlease concentrate
  on a-z, A-Z and A.sc-Z.sc at the moment, all the figures and special characters
  are not very clean yet.\r\n\r\nEven in the basic characters, there are some inconsistencies
  yet, where I'm not sure which direction I should go (see lowercase r or upper case
  Y for example). The Smallcaps are still quite dirty, especially the serifs.\r\n\r\nThere
  are 4 cuts at the moment:\r\nroman book\r\nroman titling\r\nitalic book\r\nitalic
  titling\r\n\r\nMaybe there will be a semibold some time later, but this is just
  an idea. I don't know if it really fits, but it would give some more flexibility
  for typographers.\r\n\r\nenough talking... chop it :)\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n"

  body: There seems to be a curiously odd rd line though the uppercase 'I' on page
    3, not that it has anything to do with the typeface however. I think it's lovely,
    and to come from a type battle none the less. (Where did they go anyhow?)

  body: "I find the fading of the ampersand a little much, I like it, but I think
    I might close in the bottom gap just a hair or two more. Also on the 'sk', 'sp'
    and 'st' ligatures, there's a bit of a point sticking out that doesn't come down
    as smooth as it should.\r\n\r\nThere's a glitch or two in the PDF, but it doesn't
    seem to be part of the font, such a there's a negative knockout in the lowercase
    'y' of the titling italic sample page."

  body: "Lovely & crafty.\r\n\r\nThe italic 'a' seems to be at slightly the wrong
    angle.  It seems like it should tilt to the right just a tad more.\r\n\r\nThe
    shape of the italic 'w' bugs me a bit, although I'm having a hard time describing
    why. It's as if the right-hand curve is trying to decide whether to be just slanted
    or curved.\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: "I don't see any reason why the eth shouldn't come up to full height. Is there
    a good one?\r\n\r\nI know that before I knew a lot about fonts, I was distracted
    even by the fact that a lot of fonts have capitals shorter than their lowercase
    ascenders. I thought it was an amateur mistake, and distracting. I'm not suggesting
    you change that, obviously, because it looks good in almost any font, but I think
    if you leave the eth short like that, your Icelandic reading community is going
    to be distracted, and a good text font ought to be pretty much invisible to laymen."

  body: Wow. This seems really nice. I like it's rough and slightly chunky feeling.
    I am printing out the PDF to see what it feels like off screen. I'll let you know
    how it looked to me in a day or two.

    Type Battles (I miss them too). I'd love to hear about its progress.

  body: "I have come back to this a few times. Something was bugging giving me pause
    but I wasn't sure what - especially since the forms are so nice when they are
    big. In the end I think I found all the lovely detail & character made the face
    noisy to me at small sizes. What you are doing for optical scale seems to be working
    as far as I can tell. Maybe making the intensity of character fade up with display
    sizes and lessen with text sizes would help me. Or maybe the detail/character
    needs to be more apparent and isn't just below some kind of threshold. I ma not
    sure which. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this? "

    is especially lovely.\r\nDid you get further with developing the shapes? I hope
    this turns into a whole font! :)"
