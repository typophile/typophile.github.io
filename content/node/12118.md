  24, 1928)\r\n\r\nAdrian Frutiger is best known as a type-designer. He has produced
  some of the most well known and widely used typefaces. He was born in 1928 in Interlaken,
  Switzerland, and by the age of 16 was working as a printer's apprentice near his
  home town. Following this he moved to Zurich where he studied at the Zurich School
  of Arts and Crafts, under Professor [[Walter Kach]]. \r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nAfter
  his education in Zurich, Frutiger moved to Paris where he started to work at the
  [[Deberny & Peignot]] typefoundry. Here he helped the foundry move classic typefaces
  used with traditional printing methods to newer phototypesetting technologies.\r\n\r\nAt
  the same time Frutiger started to design his own typefaces, a few of which became
  very significant, and this earned him his status as a great type designer. Throughout
  his career he has produced a number of books, such as:\r\n\r\nType, Sign, Symbol
  (1980)\r\nSigns and Symbols: Their Design and Meaning (1989)\r\nThe International
  Type Book (1990)\r\nGeometry of Feelings (1998)\r\nThe Development of Western Type
  Carved in Wood Plates (1999)\r\nForms and Counterforms (1999) \r\nLife Cycle (1999)
  \r\nThe Univers (1999)\r\nSymbols and Signs: Explorations (1999)\r\n\r\nToday his
  typefaces are readily available from a number of different foundries. He is still
  alive (2005) and has worked on revisions with Linotype of a number of his typefaces.
  Such recent collaborations have resulted in Frutiger Next and Avenir Next, which
  have included refined forms and true italics. Presently Frutiger lives in Bern,
  Switzerland and is working with woodcuts.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Types of Adrian Frutiger:</strong>\r\n\r\n\u2022
  President (1952)\r\n\r\nAlthough often disregarded, this was Frutiger\u2019s first
  commercially released typeface, by the Deberny & Peignot type foundry. The typeface
  was crucial in Frutiger's development as a designer and taught him much about letterforms
  that he applied to his future designs.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Phoebus (1953) \r\n\r\n\u2022
  Ondine (1954) \r\n\r\n\u2022 M\xE9ridien (1955) \r\n\r\nM\xE9ridien is considered
  to be Frutiger\u2019s first significant typeface, and inspired by 16th-century Jenson.
  \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Egyptienne (1956)\r\n\r\nThis is a slab-serif face designed right
  before he designed Univers, and has many resemblances to the style of Clarendon.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  [[Univers]] (1956)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Apollo (1962)\r\n\r\nApollo is an old-style serif
  typeface designed to have the dual functionality of headline as well as body text.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Serifa (1967)\r\n\r\nSerifa is a slab-serif design, based on the forms of Univers.
  It was designed to be used a large variety of sizes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 OCR-B (1968)\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface used for optical character recognition in America (OCR-A) was deemed inappropriate
  for use in Europe. Fruitger was commissioned to design this typeface to be used
  for European OCR while remaining aesthetically pleasing. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Iridium
  (1975)\r\n\r\nIridium is a serif type designed with a relatively strong contrast
  between the thick and thin strokes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 [[Frutiger]] (1975)\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Glypha (1979)\r\n\r\nGlypha is another slab-serif based on the forms of Univers,
  much like Serifa, but with a larger x-height for greater legibility, and more weights.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Icone (1980)\r\n\r\nA typeface based on stone inscriptions found in Normandy and
  Ireland.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Breughel (1982)\r\n\r\nA serif type designed for book and
  use at text sizes; like Meridien it was based on the forms of 16th century Jenson.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Versailles (1982)\r\n\r\nA serif typeface suitable for headlines and small amounts
  of copy that was based on inscriptions from 19th century France, in particular those
  found on the back of the tombstone of Charles Garnier.\r\n\r\n\u2022 [[Avenir]]
  (1988)\r\n\r\nAvenir, French for future, is a geometric sans-serif, with many similarities
  to Futura. It was designed in a number of different weights. The forms of the letters
  are not completely geometric and this aspect of the face is what gives it its own
  distinct character that separates it from other geometrics such as Futura and Century
  Gothic. Avenir is also highly legible, and has recently been revised, like Frutiger
  Next, by Linotype and Frutiger himself to include true italics and other features.
  The new family is called [[Avenir Next]]\r\n\r\n\u2022 Vectora (1990)\r\n\r\nVectora
  is a sans-serif typeface inspired by American-styled typefaces such as Franklin
  and News Gothic.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sources:</strong>\r\n\r\n\"Adrian Frutiger.\" Wikipedia.
