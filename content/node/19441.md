  some of you could help me to ID these two (or one) typefaces.\r\n\r\nOn the main

  on the following page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.delias.com/content/help/jsp/index.jsp?topnavTrack=help\r\n\r\nthis
  graphic:\r\n\r\nhttp://www-ll.delias.com//content/help/img/main_random.gif\r\n\r\nIt's
  probably something so obvious, but I can't seem to pin-point it. Any help will be
  much appreciated."

  body: Bingo! I should have looked closer at the allmusic.com page, they use the

    Thanks for your help.
