  Olicana, written with a steel nib and ink, I thought I'd go more up-to-date with
  a Ball Pentel, but still with the mostly connected feel. I hope to achieve the authentic
  handwritten look of Olicana with this one, implementing lots of ligatures and some
  contextual alternates for certain characters. Or I might have individual characters
  as stylistic sets so that one or more characters may be substituted. I shall probably
  have Rough and Smooth styles also. \r\n\r\nI am not sure about keeping the 'lumpy'
  bits in the smooth style or smoothing them out.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rollerscript2_5969.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rollerscript3_6237.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rollerscript1_5112.gif]"

    your tutorial for the day:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crossing_4881.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    crossings out were done by having crossings out in 8 lengths from short to long.
    Each of these is then placed to the left of the left side bearing in the glyph
    window, thus placing it over the previously typed characters. The width of the
    crossing glyph is set quite narrow - (198 in this case) so that it can be selected
    if need be. You can see in the picture how many spaces are needed to make the
    Crossing_7 glyph appear after the word. The Crossing_7 glyph is selected in the
    picture and you can see the width is narrow and the glyph itself is to the left.\r\n\r\nI
    hope that is clear enough - it may become clearer if you study the metrics."

    models. The \"British people (who can't write properly)\" are accustomed to a
    form more related to the corsiva Cancelleresca, unconnected, while the two connected
    forms (especially the \"descending\" z) are common in calligraphic styles which
    are not constantly used. You are right, however, by saying that this is due to
    a lack of culture, and history of our alphabet.\r\nI think the observation riccard0
    made is more related to how [A] connects to the subsequent lowercase letters.
    The stroke makes a curve, and this looks strange. I think [A] does not need so
    much ligatures, which are otherwise neat with [B] or other capital letters.\r\nAbout
    the [N]: keep both forms, one as alternate."
