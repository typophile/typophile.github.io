  body: "\u2022It\u2019s a pretty solid concept, but the execution is lacking. \r\n\u2022The
    spacing pretty much stinks. Track out the caps, and just use Trajan instead of
    that initial font you\u2019re using now.\r\n\u2022\u201CMay 31, 2009\u201D, not
    \u201CMay 31st 2009\u201D\r\n\u2022Use a heavier weight of Trade Gothic. Or better
    yet, use a warm humanist sans.\r\n\u2022Don\u2019t run the ornaments into the
    edges and curves like that, it looks haphazard.\r\n\u2022Most Mothers-of-the-bride
    are going to be pretty pissed about lots of red on wedding invite if this is the
    bride\u2019s first marriage and she doesn\u2019t have kids."

    by Sibylle Hagmann? The upright italic is just quirky enough that is might work
    given the context.

    understand what you mean about not running the ornaments into the edges and curves...what
    would be the alternative for that if I want an all-over pattern?\r\n\r\nI can
    live with a pissed off mother-of-the-bride however : )"

    the date line, for example) have to go.

    is the heart shape of the bottom half coming across? And if not what can I do
    to make it more obvious?\r\n\r\nMiss tiffany,\r\n\r\nThe green paper is not so
    much for the Moroccan part, but for the nature part...it is seed paper that you
    can plant...but it comes in other colors...I just wanted the nature part tie in...do
    you think I should change the color?\r\n\r\nAlso why don't you like the dingbat
    flower? I think it needs a flower or something organic to balance the nature part
    in there...do you have a suggestion for what would work better...should I illustrate
    a flower instead?"

    the last effort and draw a flower. Nothing fancy, you are right that simple is
    best. \r\n\r\nThe red and green as they are right now has me seeing Christmas.
    I agree that the red could be darker and even more earthy. \r\n\r\nIs there a
    blue paper?"

    again although I only have a swatch of the final paper and not enough to print
    it on that. I also added the organic/vintage element to the pattern and am curious
    if you think that works. I am certainly much happier with it after listening to
    everyone's comments...so thanks a lot!

  body: "Quite nice overall!\r\n\r\nIs it just the raster, or is the \"3\" preceding
    \"PM\" larger than the numerals in the date?\r\n\r\nTraditionally, all caps should
    have looser tracking than this, improving readability. If you're at 0 now, I'd
    bring it up to 15 (or 10 or 20; use your best judgment).\r\n\r\nAgain, it could
    just be the small raster, but the bottom line looks slightly larger the preceding
    lines.\r\n\r\nLastly, the large numerals are unsettling for me. After adjusting
    the tracking on the words, I would reduce the size of the numerals so they cooperate
    a little more. Maybe that's just me though.\r\n\r\nYou've done a beautiful job
    with this piece! My comments are just details to bring it all together a bit more.

    are too inconsistent--disturbingly so. especially the arabic numerials which are
    disproportionately large. As well, the minimalist sans serif body face is at odds
    with, not complimentary to the Header face which is beautifully and subtly reminiscent
    of the the mid-eastern element. the internal proportions of the faces as they
    related to each other are off\u2014work toward a golden mean."

    what a golden mean is, but not how to use it here.\r\n\r\nI see what you mean
    about the proportions of the counter space in the letters not being similar. That
    is very interesting and I had not thought of considering that when combining typefaces...but
    I will from now on so thanks for that. If you care to elaborate on the golden
    mean comment I am all ears."
