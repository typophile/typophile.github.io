body: I flat with a chap who writes some  <BR>things every now and then. He would  <BR>quite
  like to see it in print, so I decided <BR>to &#39;publish&#39; him. To do this,
  I have invented <BR>the Papercut Press. &#40;Inspired while using <BR>the guillotine
  at work&#41;. Naturally, Papercut <BR>has to have a logo, so I have made a few <BR>variations.
  What do you all think?  <BR> <BR>kris. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42849.gif"

  body: Hi Kris, <BR> <BR>The paper/guillotine image is effective, especially in your
    3rd example. This could be developed futher. Have you tried it as a black mark
    with the outline reversed out?  <BR>I like the 4th variation also, although the
    combination of letters might be read as &#39;dp&#39;.

  body: I definitive go with the first three images. i like the mix between text and
    image, in terms of weight i think the first one is the better, the only thing
    i would work on is on centering the line between Papercut and Press like in your
    second image. <BR> <BR>nice done <BR> <BR>CG

  body: Kris, I think it&#39;s well-made, and the font choice is good, but it&#39;s
    too predictable. <BR>If you could get the logo to cause a smile of surprise, that
    would be great. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Thanks for the comments. I wanted the  <BR>logo originally to be humorous,
    but it  <BR>got a little serious along the way. The  <BR>font is custom, Hrant,
    and it is predictable. <BR>I think I might give Klim Sans a whirl!  <BR>Keep the
    humour Kris, keep the humour

  body: Wait, I didn&#39;t mean that the font&#42; was predictable! <BR>I meant that
    the logo &#40;&#34;document icon&#34; &#43; &#34;guillotine&#34;&#41; was. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; And you say it&#39;s custom? As in you made it? Niiice. <BR> <BR>hhp

    I made it. It is one of the million variations <BR>of kilbirnie serif. Erm, I&#39;ll
    finish one day. Garrr'

  body: impo,the logo could be siplified and abstrated more. Right know it communicates
    the name just fine however it dosn&#39;t tell me anything more.&#40;on an abstract
    level&#41;. Also right know it feels more like an illustration than a logo. My
    gut also tells me the logo should be more sharp and severe. All the way down to
    the typography. I tend to think of where this logo might be used. I don&#39;t
    feel like it would hold up on the spine of book at a very small size. The PP ligature
    looks like dp. The typeface is actually pretty nice come to think of it.

  body: How about incorporating a second color &#40;red&#41;? That&#39;s the color
    anyone who gets a paper cut encounters... You don&#39;t want to get gory, but
    I could imagine a thin red line in there somehow... :-&#41; <BR> <BR>--M.

  body: What about having the blade of the document slicing into a letterform? Too
    obvious? <BR> <BR>Beautiful work, btw. Love the idea.

  body: I really like the logo, to me thats a clever idea. Even if it was a bit predictable
    its still memorable. Number one works the best for me, with the stronger stroke
    on the symbol it should still look good printed at smaller sizes. <BR>The other
    concept with the PP ligature is lacking the spirit of the first ones.  <BR> <BR>Great
    work.

  body: The position of the paper/blade in the third example creates a sense of tension
    and potential energy that&#39;s engaging. <BR> <BR>What if the tip of the paper/blade
    slightly overlapped the word &#39;Papercut&#39;? That would set up a dimensional
    sort of chopping block illusion. <BR> <BR>Looks good Kris.
