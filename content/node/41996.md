body: "Hi everyone, I'm new here so please be gentle. \r\n\r\nI had a bit of a conundrum
  regarding a project I am working on. The project itself is the Out & About Phonebook,
  which is a free phone directory of gay owned and gay friendly businesses throughout
  the U.S. I was in charge of a drastic re-brand for the book, and when designing
  the identity I wanted to use a font that was not going to be widely recognizable.
  I ended up falling in love with Absara Sans for it's unique ampersand (http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_absara_sans_ot_medium/)
  and set the logotype in it. The problem being that my company only had the budget
  for one weight of the font, in this case medium. \r\n\r\nHere is my question: would
  it be wise to use Absara in the layout of the book (for headings and such), knowing
  I only have access to this one weight (and conversely is it a mistake to not use
  the font if it makes up the logotype)? Also, if using Absara is a good route to
  take, what more widely available fonts with larger families would work well with
  this font? So far I have tried pairing Absara with various serifs including Berkeley,
  Garamond, and ITC Cheltenham. Any advice would help me out a bunch. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  Here's a copy of the logo for reference if it will help. Another note, the subtext
  is set in Futura light, and while still part of the logo I can probably swap out
  the font of that part without too much hassle from the higher-ups. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OA_Logo_4755.jpg]"

  body: "@ jupiterboy: The pages will all be pretty text heavy and is more than likely
    going to be printed on newsprint\r\n\r\n@ James Puckett: The latter. I would definitely
    not set the entire book in it. My question is really in regards to whether or
    not I should use the font I composed the logotype from in the design of the layout.\r\n\r\n@
    aluminum: We actually do have a web based directory. You can check it out here
    (www.myoutandabout.com). Unfortunately it was created from a template and uses
    the old design (blech!)"

  body: "Bell Centennial is made for this use\u2014if set small enough it might work
    but it doesn't have any particular affinity for Absara. Also Lucida Fax might
    be worth some testing, IDK, it also doesn't have much to recommend matching it
    with Absara. "

    our advertising packages include both print and web ads. Since the book is free,
    all of our money comes from advertising.
