    told that the two \"e\"s hinted at a bow, I thought it might be nice to make it
    literal."

  body: 'I also like the bow (of the first option), but I can''t help being immediately
    drawn to the word "vents" at the end of the logotype. I think there''s almost
    <em>too much</em> difference in style and color between the bow and the type.
    I don''t read the bow as part of the name, just a symbol stuck inside it: <strong>expressiv</strong>}{<strong>vents</strong>'

  body: as someone who is actually in the wedding industry, i think that the first
    combo design is the best design. the key for me is to make the logo stand out
    because this industry is so heavily saturated with imagery. the e's that make
    the ribbon make it unique. i would not change it.

    is suppose to be print on the object? If so, I don't want to break the work you've
    already done, but I find the word is too wide for the object <em>(small wedding
    accessories)</em> is gone to be printed on. "

  body: Here is a new version, i changed one of the e's to a different typeface and
    brought the kerning between the symbol e and the "vents" to make it look more
    like one word. Whaddya think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eelogo_round2.gif]

  body: "The lowercase 'e's in the bow feel a bit disturbing to me now, not so much
    the right-reading one (I like that one a lot), but the reversed one. Also, I'm
    not so sure your type should have so much letterspace. If you want to make the
    overall impression lighter, go with a lighter face or an italic. Letterspaced
    lowercase disrupts the word shape and the relationship of the letters, hurting
    the viewer's ability to get a quick read.\r\n\r\nYou probably don't have to make
    the fact that the bow is made lowercase 'e's so direct. I recommend separating
    the two and just setting some good easy-to-read type and allowing for the 'Ah
    ha!' moment with the flower mark. Or, you could add the reversed pink 'e' to the
    brown initial 'e' in both expressive and in events...might work.\r\n\r\nHave you
    tried italic type?"

  body: "Cio,\r\n\r\nYou've found a clever way to use the two e(s) as a bow. I prefer
    the original as it seems a little  less \"worked over\". I wonder if you really
    need it in the name also. If you simply chose a nice typeface and then used the
    mark alongside or elsewhere I think it would be stronger.\r\n\r\nI also don't
    think you need the pink underscore, especially at that weight. What if you make
    it thinner and hand-drawn to tie-in with the hand quality of the mark?"

  body: "Thank you all for your comments so far...I have found them very insightful.\r\n\r\nChris,
    I had tried italic type (in the very early stages of the design), I found that
    including the symbol along with the italic type didnt work as well. The client
    and I had agreed that the symbol should be able to be part of the logo itself
    but be easily separated from the logotype in order to be used as an icon or watermark
    on some materials. That is part of the criteria that I must work the design around,
    but if you have any other suggestions I would be happy to hear them.\r\n\r\nMiss
    Tiffany, I will try a version with the pink underscore at a lighter weight and
    one that is more hand-drawn as well. Thank you for the suggestion. "
