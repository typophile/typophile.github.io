body: "This small Z-fold brochure folds down to 3 x 4.25\" (with the cover title,
  \"The Unique Woman.\")\r\nI've been trying to pair two complementary handwritten
  typefaces that work nicely with the brochure's artwork.\r\nI've used Prater-script
  and Handsome-nib and like them both, but I'm not convinced they are the answer.
  I don't think the goal is for them to be written in the same \"hand,\" as much as
  it is for them to blend well with the free spirit of the piece and create an overall
  harmony.\r\nAny feedback, suggestions or insight is appreciated\u2014I've never
  been involved in a forum before and I miss being part of a critique."

    when you don't have square text-boxes... Are you going to replace the drawings
    with real footage? Will the text be inverted/negative?"

  body: "Instead of using a script font, why not just write the script text yourself...maybe
    get one other person to write the other script text and scan them both in? Possibly
    getting the client to write it? This will go along with the existing hand-drawn
    illustrations and pull everything together.\r\n\r\nOther than that, everything
    else looks great."
