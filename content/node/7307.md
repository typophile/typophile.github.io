  body: ' Just to get back to the original subject of copying/pirating of type designs.
    This isn&#39;t just a current trend, but has been a problem for hundreds of years.
    There are many examples, from the copying of the Romain du Roi, to electrotyping
    in the 1800s, to all the American knock-offs of European faces in the first half
    of the 20th century. <BR> <BR>Stephen originally used the phrase &#34;devaluation
    of type design.&#34; I guess this is one way to look at it, but then again, did
    type design ever have much &#40;perceived&#41; value to 99.99% of people to begin
    with?  <BR> <BR>While it would be nice if everyone who uses fonts on the computer
    became &#34;educated&#34; about type - so that they would then use it properly
    and pay for it properly - this seems pretty unlikely. I think on the whole most
    people wouldn&#39;t be interested enough or care enough to be &#34;educated.&#34;
    And I&#39;m not lamenting this fact because it makes perfect sense at this point
    in time.  <BR> <BR>Maybe the big thing is to really start to try to go after designers/art
    directors who steal type and use it to make money by designing things with it
    &#40;and who all know very well that they should be paying for their type &amp;
    don&#39;t need to be &#34;educated&#34;&#41;.  <BR> <BR>One last thing about valuing
    or devaluing type. I think it has a lot to do with the type in question. To be
    honest, I don&#39;t think I could get too worked up about the piracy of most T-26
    faces. I would say that the amount of time and effort that goes into the average
    T-26 face is much less than a high quality font done by more &#39;traditional&#39;
    designers. Just because T-26 released something &#40;and overcharges for it&#41;
    doesn&#39;t mean that it necessarily carries a certain amount a value &#40;intrinsically&#41;.
    All fonts are not created equal. The T-26 library is heavy on the ephemeral and
    slapdash. While there are of course exceptions, it seems like they do very well
    in adhering to a &#34;quantity of quality&#34; model. <BR> <BR>That said, obviously
    I realize that the &#40;copyright&#41; law is the copyright law. '

  body: ' To Anonymous&#39; point: <BR> <BR>Yes, but it is not the ONLY value of design,
    and specifically not the only value of TYPE DESIGN. <BR> <BR>Your opinion, taken
    alone and as stated, ignores the rights of the artist to receive compensation
    and to determine who can and who cannot use her/his work. In my business, I design
    typefaces as well as offering other graphic design services and creating watercolor
    paintings. If I create, for example, a multiple-use piece for a client, I expect
    to be justly compensated for it. If someone else comes along afterward and uses
    that same piece again &#40;my work&#41; without my permission, I should have legal
    recourse to receive compensation for that use of my piece &#40;as well as punitive
    recourse for the unauthorized use of my work&#41;. This goes for my fonts as well
    as my design and watercolor work. <BR> <BR>Remember, before metal type, there
    was only hand-lettering &#40;inscriptional, illuminated, calligraphic, etc.&#41;,
    and the artist earned and deserved her/his just compensation. In a nutshell, the
    invention of metal type simply made the lettering profession more prolific and
    convenient. The invention of digital type had the same effect, only exponentially
    more so. However, none of these advancements should negate the obligation of compensation
    to the originator of the work, nor the obligation to seek permission for use.
    The ways of achieving this have developed over the years into licensing and other
    contractual agreements, but the obligation is there nonetheless. It is sadly true
    that the law has much catching up to do in protecting the full rights of artists
    and designers, but the obligation to do so remains. <BR> <BR>The notion of &#34;perceived
    value&#34; is more or less irrelevent as well. If a person doesn&#39;t perceive
    a value of a work, then she/he certainly has no obligation to utilize it. This
    is true whether the work is artistic &#40;museum or otherwise&#41;, illustrative,
    photographic, literary, sculptural, typographic, or any other creative endeavor.
    Specifically in the case of type fonts, there are more than enough bundled fonts
    &#40;which is actually a contracted form of compensation, pre-arranged by the
    designer&#41; and fonts that are distributed freely by their designers out there
    to satisfy those who perceive no value to type design. Let those who do value
    the craft reap the benefits of new innovations, and let them give just compensation
    for it. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t get into design to simply communicate, or to simply
    share my creations with the world, and I make no apologies for that.  I also have
    the real-world concerns of putting food on the table and paying my rent, among
    many others. <BR> <BR>The moment the world tells me others have an open right
    to my work without just compensation and without seeking my permission, and that
    I have no legal recourse to enforce anything otherwise, that is the moment I find
    a new profession. It would simply no longer be worth my effort. '

    From the perspective of the &#42;craft&#42; of type design, piracy of Mantinia
    is much worse than piracy of Cholla, for example. From this perspective, sales
    -or even use- have no bearing. But of course that&#39;s not the only perspective.
    <BR> <BR>So, from what perspective are any two fonts &#42;exactly&#42; and &#42;always&#42;
    the same? From that of people who want to bring into existence as many guilty
    people as possible, with no regard for true typographic merit. Like lawyers. <BR>

    Or craft involved in a makeing. Once it released, it be FREE fro teh takeing.
