body: "Hello,\r\n I was directed to this forum by people at FontLab, when I had contacted
  them with a very specific help request. So, here goes my help request:\r\n\r\nI
  am an member/office bearer of a non-profit organization. We print out newsletter
  in a particular script (devanagari). I have a few fonts which are free for use.
  But they cannot be embedded. I had contacted the creator of those fonts and he mentioned
  to me that he was no longer looking after them. He also had suggested if I could
  find out a way, then I should go ahead and inform him as well. That brings me to
  this question. I have tried fontlab trial version and I can see that I can change
  the embedding option. The only need I have is enabling the embedding option for
  these fonts. Buying an expensive software just for this purpose will not be accepted
  by the organization. I was wondering if you would help me out somehow.\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see my only need is to enable embedding on the font files I already have.
  If someone can help me out it would be great. Thanks again. \r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAmit"

    a local experienced FontLab user familiar with the generation of the fonts and
    scripts you need. Getting help from someone here is another good option if the
    creator is willing to consent via electronic communication. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "As mentioned, I have contacted the creator of these files and he mentioned
    that he is now a \"bit removed\" from this. I do not think he specifically intended
    to disable embedding, but that must have been the default option setup by whichever
    font program he must have used. Also, if someone here is willing to help, I can
    facilitate the process of getting the consent. I already have his consent (he
    has asked me to keep him updated). I am pretty sure he will be fine with it. So,
    if there is anyone.. willing to enable the option for me/us... let me know. Thanks
    again.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAmit"

    but it does not allow me to change the embedding option. There is a drop down
    menu with just one item in it.. which is the current embedding option that does
    not allow embedding. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAmit"

    it on a system that does not have the fonts.. but at least the font property seems
    to have changed. Thanks for support guys! \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAmit"
