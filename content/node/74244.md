body: What is the correct way to handle to hook on eng being massive in very heavy
  fonts? Should the hook just hang down below the descenders, cedillas, etc.? Should
  the design of the N part of eng be altered to bring the hook up in line with everything
  else? Should the hook just be relatively light?
