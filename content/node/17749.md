  body: That's <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/browsebydesigner2.php?u_id=622">Stephen
    Farrell</a>'s <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=713">Missive</a>,
    one of the original hybrid faces that made everyone notice [[Carlos Segura]]'s
    <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts.php">T-26</a> when it emerged on the type market
    in the early nineties, the heydays of [[grunge]] typography.

  body: It's funny how Stephen made Missive -- a mash-up of what looks like Sabon
    and News Gothic -- evolve into <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=710">Entropy</a>
    by welding the Missive caps with Stymie, and then eventually end up with <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=714">Osprey</a>
    by smashing it all into Park Avenue.

  body: What's remarkable is WaMu has a mix of T-26 and DTL if you can imagine it,
    <a href="http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Nieuws.html">DTL Prokyon for WaMu</a>
    (scroll a bit), though maybe (hopefully) they're in a transition.
