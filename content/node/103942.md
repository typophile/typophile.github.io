  font expert. It seems to be somewhere between Playbill and Rockwell. I'm hoping
  one of you will recognize it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Note that the serif is bracketed, i.e. the linking stroke between the stem
    and the square serif is curved. This letterform is named after the Clarendon Press,
    where it was used from the mid-19th century onwards. Robert Besley is usually
    given credit for the design. A vast number of Clarendon variations have been designed
    since then. \r\nI would describe the book title font as something like Clarendon
    Black Narrow Condensed. Don't know what you mean as an \"old\" book cover but
    the letters it may be something from the font photo composition era. The treatment
    in the title pushes the limits of how far whitespace can be squeezed with the
    Clarendon design. I expect that a digital designer has also tried this and released
    it as a font, perhaps under a name other than Clarendon, which is registered by
    Adobe. Perhaps this will jog the memory of one of our typophiles. \r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks for getting the ball rolling. By \"old\" I mean predating my birth.
    Your mileage may vary. :-)\r\n\r\nI scanned the cover of the fourth printing of
    the book (1977) to give you the image sample, although I presume that the same
    typeface was used for the first printing in 1967."

  body: hm. a quick search leads me to [[http://www.fonts.com/font/urw/egyptienne/bold-condensed-d|Egyptienne
    Bold Condensed]]. if a fatter cut is available it might be nicer, or you can just
    feed it some candy & enfatten it yourself.

    of a fairly short editing session:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EditedClarendonBlack_4453.jpg]\r\nBut
    I still hope for you that somebody has already done this for the full font.\r\nDon"
