    S matched the second.

    the s's. Looks like Rotis, but not it...

    Which it is not.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this: you are a designer. Either you have
    a design that is non-design (\"I don't waste my time doing my own logo, because
    I save my creativity for my clients\") ... or you make something that will make
    everyone drop dead with envy.\r\n\r\nCheck out the identity of the top ten design

    typeface 'non-design'. The explicit decision making process of choosing the appropriate
    typeface is very much design.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's non-decorated, or non-flourished,
    but I find it a perfectly acceptable design solution.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@aluminium\r\nYou're right, of course. But you get my point: Pentagram \"just
    chose a typeface\". So did Landor. So did Wolff Olins. None of them felt the need
    to add a little twist like Sugo has done."

  body: Thanks for everyone's comments.  I will be using all the advice and see what
    I come up with.  November I understand what you're saying.  But I don't think
    a firm like Pentagram "just" chose anything.  I believe everything was thought
    out, tracked out and chosen to perfection.  My "twist" had a concept behind it
    in the beginning.  But by overworking it, I have strayed and lost it. Let's see
    what I get in round 2 (more like 12 :)

  body: Hi Sugo - I think the 'S' should be the same too. Nice considered choice of
    typeface - v good. I don't know if you saw my post earlier but we are also updating
    our logo (Profile1). We are stuck between using pure Avant Garde or modifying
    it with one or two tweaks. I change my mind between the two at least three times
    every fifteen minutes! I have always loved Avant Garde - the KING of the geometric
    sans. I think you have to be extremely careful when you are tweaking such a fine
    piece of work. The amount of consideration and time that has gone into our tweaked
    version is huge - but i'm still not sure it's even close to looking as good as
    the original set type. It so easy to do toooooo much.

  body: "The type weights you are using do not feel like they are harmonizing together.
    I feel like the word DESIGN is eventually going to give out to the massive weight
    of SUGO. Maybe the word SUGO can come down in type size, while keeping it bold.
    \r\n\r\nPlus the letter spacing feels really tight. Words in all upper caps always
    need a little extra space between them. \r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n-Joe"

    now that I compared the original, I realized that I have modified the font ( see
    attached image). I wanted to make the logo more solid, more grounded than it was
    in the original typeface. \r\n\r\nPlease link me to your previous post.  I didn't
    see it.\r\n\r\nJoseph,\r\nI'll give it some room to breathe, let's see what happens.\r\n"
