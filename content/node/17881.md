    body: "Alia,\r\n\r\nIt has to do with how Illustrator deals with CMYK black versus
      RGB black. One of the black defaults in Illustrator is a \"rich black\" composed
      of different levels of C, M, Y, and K. The other is C0 M0 Y0 K100, and shows
      up as a very dark grey. In the most recent version of Illustrator, you can change
      how it handles black as far as displaying, printing, and exporting to other
      applications.\r\n\r\nAlternately, you can always just save the image from Illustrator
      using the \"Save for Web\" feature; it is extremely handy. Just set your crop
      marks in advance.\r\n\r\n- Josh\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\u2014\xE6\u2014\r\n<strong>\"Wishers

  body: Aye. Can anyone explain the function of the wide chunks hanging off the MCRI
    numerals? My first thought was that the verticals with the lighter stroke weight
    would be too thin for the magnetic readers, and the 'chunks' serve to distinguish
    characters from one another... but look at the 2 and the 5; they're almost exactly
    alike without the vertical strokes, so the reader must be able to perceive strokes
    that thin.

    the purpose of the thick/thin patterns.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the MICR readers
    detect the presence of the magnetic ink over time. I suppose the thin/thick patterns
    of the E-13B helps differentiate each figure in order to increase the speed and
    accuracy of the face. The page I linked above seems to provide a technical explaination
    for the varying widths of the characters.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is interesting to see
    how different the other MICR typefaces are, especially the CMC-7 below. It even
