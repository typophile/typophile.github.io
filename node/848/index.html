		<div class="commentbody">John, Hrant &ndash;  <BR> <BR>Matthew was commissioned recently to create a new  <BR>design to be cut in wood type by the Hamilton Wood  <BR>Type &amp; Printing Museum in Two Rivers, WI. (Carter says  <BR>the invitation caused him to realize that wood was, in  <BR>fact, a technology that he had never created type for  <BR>before.) His design is an all-caps, chunky, latin-serif  <BR>design and is called Carter Latin. One of the more  <BR>notable aspects of the design is that it has two variants  <BR>&ndash; a positive and a negative &ndash; which can be combined  <BR>for interesting figure-ground interrelationships. The  <BR>typeface is done, but the font is still being manufactured,  <BR>I think. Matthew confessed that last weekend was the  <BR>first time he's actually seen it. It will be available in  <BR>wood, one size only for now, I believe &ndash; 12-line (about  <BR>2 inches). <BR> <BR>There's nothing about this project on the <a href="http://www.woodtype.org" target="_blank"> Hamilton website</a> yet. <BR> <BR>Matthew has the rights to produce a digital font, but says  <BR>he's not inclined to do it any time soon, so that the  <BR>Hamilton can have a measure of exclusivity for a while. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

Hamilton Offset was presented in the Goldstein Gallery at the University of Minnesota earlier this year. I had the pleasure of admiring the type at that time and after a quick google search discovered that the font was already available digitally. Unfortunately I missed 98% of  Carter's presentation, but it's exciting that the Hamilton Woodtype Museum is undertaking the creation of new typefaces in wood.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The process for creating the Hamilton Offset typeface was interesting. It reminded me of the deconstructed type in the 90s, but it's far from it. I think it's great that they are still interested in making new woodtype. Matthew Carter's design is great. And as expected, he did something that's just a little bit different! Hey, let's organize a trip to Two Rivers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The funniest thing at TypeCon: <BR>When Si introduced himself as moderator of the Blog and  <BR>Communities panel and said, &quot;I'm Si Daniels and I work for  <BR>Microsoft. Sorry about that.&quot; <BR> <BR>The most frustrating moment: <BR>Scoring a 6 on that *lousy type quiz (okay 8, if I give myself  <BR>2 points for getting my name right). I had to second  <BR>Stephen's assertion that it needed some questions from  <BR><i>this</i> half of the last century. (*No offense Kent, it's just  <BR>that you have to come down to the rest of our levels to  <BR>speak to us. Haha. I guess next year I should do some  <BR>homework.) <BR> <BR>The warmest fuzzy: <BR>Realizing that the people you've looked up to forever are  <BR>genuinely warm, friendly people. (Awww.) <BR> <BR>The truest prediction: <BR>Jill Bell lamented that the Mac OS Finder should be able to  <BR>recognize and activate fonts by double clicking them. The  <BR>guy from Apple granted her wish 4 hours later when he  <BR>gave a demo of Apple's Mac OS X update, Panther (Mac OS  <BR>X 2.6). <BR> <BR>The strangest moment: <BR>Sitting at lunch with Delve Withrington, hoping he doesn't  <BR>notice me staring, thinking <i>Is he really an immortal vampire?</i> <BR>By the end of the conference I still couldn't tell&hellip; <BR> <BR>The second worst moment: <BR>Realizing that our room did not have high speed internet  <BR>access. <BR> <BR>The worst moment: <BR>Realizing that, not only did our room not have high speed  <BR>internet access, but that the hotel's &quot;business center&quot;  <BR>consisted of a single PC and a single chair in a closet-sized  <BR>space that was constantly occupied. (I humbly suggest that  <BR>TypeCon '04 be held at San Francisco's wireless enabled  <BR>Herbst Theater or similarly equipped venue for us tech- <BR>spoiled kids.) <BR> <BR>Biggest regret: <BR>Flying on Priceline. Leaving Sunday morning. Essentially we  <BR>missed the one day of the conference that was dominated  <BR>by people of my own generation &ndash; Test Pilot, Miniml,  <BR>Aesthetic Apparatus among others. <BR> <BR>The simplest pleasure: <BR>Watching Jim Parkinson beaming like a proud parent over  <BR>the pages of Indie Fonts 2. The book itself was a catalyst  <BR>for a pile of his recent releases. I'm sure he was both  <BR>relieved to have the work done and proud of the showings.  <BR>Note to self: invite Jim over for Sunday dinner sometime. <BR> <BR>Funnest time: <BR>Sharing a panel with Si, Jon, Armin, Stephen and Jared.  <BR>There were some genuine good laughs. I'm glad we could  <BR>pull off a smoke screen so that not everyone realized  <BR>that we were sitting up there modeling the emperor's new  <BR>wardrobe.</div>
