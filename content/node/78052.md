  question? Was Desdemona Solid ever released by Letraset as a rubdown sheet? And
  if so, what was the sheet number and about what year. Thank you for any assistance
  you might lend to the discussion.\r\n\r\n-Ed M."

  body: I don't know if this is the original issue year, but Desdemona Solid shows
    up in the 1981 Letraset catalog as LG 601 to LG 604 (72, 60, 48 and 36 pt)...

  body: "Hi Oldnick.\r\n\r\nWow! That was quick. Thank you for your info. Do they
    show the entire font set ( as I recall, they probably do not). The original issue
    year is not all that important. I was hoping to find out a range of years that
    it was in their catalogs. Very, very helpful. Thank you again so much. \r\n\r\n-Ed
