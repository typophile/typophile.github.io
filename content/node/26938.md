  body: This is obviously based on some heavy Caslon and then  <BR>modified. I reckon
    you weren&#39;t hoping to find that swashy  <BR>&#34;N&#34; in the standard character
    set. The vertical serifs on  <BR>the &#34;F&#34; are giving me a hard time tho.

  body: Yes I was hoping to find that  swashy  <BR>&#34;N&#34; as the &#34;A&#34;
    has the same swash <BR>and thin lines as the N, I also was hoping <BR>I could
    puchase the font once I found out <BR>the name. Maybe some sort display font?
