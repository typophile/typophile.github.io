I remember the face because its designer, James Grieshaber, did a presentation about it at TypeCon a few years ago.
there is also a facsimile of the <em>Operina</em>, with translation into English rendered in a similar style:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Given the amount of OpenType features and language support James put into the font, I don&rsquo;t think he can be criticized for building the typeface on the premise of a verbatim interpretation of the <em>Operina</em>.</p>
<p>It is after all the archetypal model of complex calligraphy rendered in print.
If one is going to address the issue of how to render complex calligraphy in a font, the <em>Operina</em> is a good benchmark.</p>
<p>James opted for rough rather than slick, on the premise that people find this &ldquo;charming&rdquo;, and because, I would imagine, it is readily comparable with the original, so that the way the alternate glyphs and swashes are implemented is highlighted.</p>
<p>Even so, despite this supposedly literal interpretation, he still had to decide on which particular instances of each character to base his digitization on&ndash;because the <em>Operina</em> is not made from type. So he also had to figure out how to make it fit as type.</p>
<p>There are many more considerations in making a calligraphic typeface than the degree of finish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that most calligraphy-mimicking fonts are either too slick or too rough, but that is because, as you are well aware, taking the middle course requires the utmost skill and concentration, and is a shit-load of work.</p>
<p>Michael, which do you think are the most successful fonts that interpret calligraphy with creativity and finesse?</p>
<p>Or are you imagining something between Olicana Rough and Olicana Smooth?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rough or smooth, Olicana came from an &ldquo;honest hand.&rdquo; They are both the same to me&hellip; just a different finish which supplies the designer with a wider palette since both could be used in different situations with forethought. Nick was thoughtful and did a good job.</p>
<p>Figuring &ldquo;complex calligraphy&rdquo; in open type, in the case of Operina, is still using existing &ldquo;characters&rdquo; and just turns it into a simple exercise in digital work, where&rsquo;s the creative bent?</p>
<p>If one is going to ponder the dubious road of a calligraphic &ldquo;type&rdquo; then one has to consider (at least for me) something that is at least new, different, and (for me) less representational of copied/existing work. I am not a revivalist, don&rsquo;t care for it, and I will not serve up a design if I have nothing new to say. And my problem with Operina is that it just seems to be digitized representations of 500 year old letterpress forms cut in wood without any sort of finesse, well other than the fact that he can throw in all sorts of alternates via opentype.</p>
<p>It is probably indicative of my thoughts that I think SANS has been done to death. I see the little nuances in the new designs but that does not sway me that anything new is being done&hellip; it is a wasted effort by technicians. But that is me.</p>
