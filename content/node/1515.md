body: Hey guys. I know I&#39;ve been away for a while and  <BR>I don&#39;t deserve
  your help, but this one is very  <BR>urgent and important. It&#39;s very close to
  E&#43;F  <BR>Anzeigen, but the &#39;o&#39; is more square. I don&#39;t  <BR>have
  the origin of the sample but I&#39;m working on  <BR>that. Thanks! <BR> <BR><img

    to the sample in Font Book...

  body: I&#39;m pretty certain on the British Inserat.  <BR>Unfortunately FontShop&#39;s
    site doesn&#39;t show it, <BR>not even the Australia site. So far, all I have
    <BR>to go on is the FontBook specimen.

  body: Looks like the three shops that sell Mecanorma <BR>fonts are FontShop, Bitmap
    in NL, and AtomicType <BR>in UK. I&#39;ll have my collegue call FontShop since
    <BR>he&#39;s in the states.
