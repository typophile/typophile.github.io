  members of the jury for the very first Letraset International Typeface Competition

  Magnificat by Friedrich Peter (how come this incredible design is NOT available
  as a software font ?) and Stilla by Fran\xE7ois Boltana.\r\nThank you very much"

    it's so packed with information that I'm never able to remember what's exactly
    in it. Therefore, I rarely use it, which is indeed a shame."
