  files and, for around twelve bucks, would make a perfect 9x12\" letterpress printing
  block of your design.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a similar service that might still
  be around anywhere?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    service isn't their priority.

  body: Yeah, that tends to be common with these sorts of things. Still, I wouldn't
    mind you referring them to me. Thanks.

  body: 'Photopolymer plates are pretty standard for commercial letterpress. Here
    in Portland, it''s the standard technique for things like wedding invitations.
    Like any kind of printing, I think good results often depends upon developing
    a relationship with the service provider. For example, if you''re careful, you
    can fit several jobs onto one plate and then separate them for printing. '

    of the woman who runs it. Just be prepared, they take forever. But they do a nice
    job and will work with you to get it right. Altho it sounds like you might only
    want the plate, not the job printed, should be simpler."
