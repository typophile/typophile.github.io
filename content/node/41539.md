body: "any ideas why I am unable to print anything other than a font table and a glyph
  list out of fontlab print menu? everything else crashes the program and makes me
  restart it. i'm on a mac, 10.4.9 and fontlab version 5.0.4. i think i recently upgraded
  to the newest version build but it was doing this before on version 5.0.1 as well\r\n\r\nthanks"
