body: "I'm curious about how the Mac OS X (10.4) provided ZapfDingbats works. It seems
  that it only has glyphs mapped into the Unicode range intended for dingbats. However,
  in Word, Quark 6.5 or InDesign CS2, if I type \"a b c\" on my keyboard, dingbats
  appear. In TextEdit, letters appear, but they are in a fallback font. This is with
  a US keyboard setting. Do some applications make an exception for Zapf, or is this
  expected behavior?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZapfABC.jpg]"

  body: "The reason I asked is because ZapfDingbats is inconsistant with my understanding
    of a Unicode font. For example, if the dingbats were glyphs from some other language
    range, I didn't think they could show up when typing with a US keyboard setting.
    \r\nThis may reveal a big misunderstaning on my part regarding encodings. Do codepages
    provide a mechanism for this substitution? Is there some key documentation that
    I should read before posting questions like this?\r\n"

  body: The Zapf Dingbats font is a special case, in that it has its own 8-bit codepage.
    Because it is unique, it is fairly easy for an application to invoke special handling
    when this font is selected, which explains why you don't need to switch keyboard
    layouts in order to access the characters.

  body: 'Thanks for the help. John, did you just know this or did you use a tool to
    examine the font? Is TTX the best tool to examine the contents of a font file?
    If it couldn''t dump info from a dfont, that would be understandable. '

  body: "I knew about Zapf Dingbats having its own 8-bit codepage, and the rest is
    guesswork based on this fact and the sometimes strange behaviour of applications
    when encountering fonts with 'ding' in the name, e.g. http://typophile.com/node/17883\r\n\r\nThere
    is a tendency in programming to hard code special cases. So if you have a font
    that has unique properties, you stick in some lines of code that say 'if this
    font is used, perform this operation'. Often, the assumptions involved end up
    causing problems at a later date."
