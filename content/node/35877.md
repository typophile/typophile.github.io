    from Tarantino''s <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syf8olcM0z4">Pulp

  body: It may not rank as "great," but the cooking show "David Rocco's Dolce Vita"
    actually lists, in the credits, the design firm of the font used in the opening

  body: "The word \"typographic\" must be used verrrryyyy loosely here... but some
    great stuff. I just watched Dr. Strangelove last week again and noticed the way
    cool typography there.\r\n\r\nI also love Thank You for Smoking: http://www.shadowplaystudio.com/smoking.html\r\n\r\nRecall
    cool type based credits for Cronenberg's Crash http://www.cronenbergcrash.com/Scenes/Credits/credits.html\r\n\r\nDead
    Ringers but can't find it on the web.\r\n\r\nThe Untouchables - shadows cast by
    huge letters - can't find it either\r\n\r\nthe remake of Cape Fear http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MoOz7D4Z94\r\n\r\nand
    one of my true favorites (hee hee) is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwgj4Wzsffw"
