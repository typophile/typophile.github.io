  extremely long company names- I am working on one company name which is Private
  Equity Hedge Fund company and it should look more like Corporate style with Extreme
  Aesthetic design (this is what i got from the CEO of the firm\r\n\r\nName is:\r\n\r\nALEXANDER
  HAWTHORN-SALMAN ANSARI & CO\r\n\r\nit could be AHSA but they insist that with AHSA
  they want to mention full name as well.\r\n\r\nSo please help me guys."

    branding systems to see what they're doing successfully in terms of wordmark creations.

  body: "I doubt if their clients actually refer to them by their long, unwieldy name.
    (\"Hey Jane, call Alexander Hawthorn-Salman Ansari & Company for me.\") They call
    them AHSA or some other shortened version.\r\n\r\nI'd go with AHSA for the logo
    and spell out their full name in smaller type."

    offer branding advice...which is to shorten the name. There's so much benefit
    in doing so. \r\n\r\n"

    a couple of AHSAs out there.\r\n\r\nAustralian Health Service Alliance\r\nAmerican
    HealthCare Services Association\r\nArabian Horse Society of Australia (this one
    made me laugh)"

    don't know why they are. Clearly Mr. Hawthorn-Salman gets most of the logo real
    estate, Mr. Alexander gets less and there's virtually nothing left for Mr. Ansari.
    No fair if you ask me :)"

    proces of long logotypes usually begins..\r\n\r\nSince you haven't posted any
    sketches my guess is you have no clue were to begin."

    of view and people don't tend to remember them.
