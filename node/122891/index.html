  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of a reddit group dedicated to researching for missing/unidentified persons. Full story [[http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe|here]], and more specifically [[http:/www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/2tzr5l/virgo_tattoo|here]].</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reaching out to this forum because the person whose case we&rsquo;re investigating now, had a tattoo in his arm with a word written on it that looks unintelligible. It looks like latin alphabet, but it seems like everyone has different opinions about what&rsquo;s written there.</p>
<p>Here are the only pictures we have of the tattoos, not great quality:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/FCD1_5632.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/FCD2_6305.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It reads so odd&hellip; It seems to me that it might have been a different word before and he subsequently tried to cover it up, but who knows, this could have been his tattoo since the beginning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out whether this is a modified word or not. If it&rsquo;s not, what does it mean; and if it is, what did it say before modifications.</p>
<p>For easiness of exposure, let&rsquo;s imagine it says &ldquo;Vagon&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>the V is strangely skewed: usually V&rsquo;s are symmetrical: /, or otherwise leaning right: |/  but this one seems to be the other way around: |</li>
<li>also, why would the left part of the V go so high up, is this normal in any typography?</li>
<li>what other letter could this have been?</li>
<li>the next letter could have originally been an &ldquo;i&rdquo;, transformed into an &ldquo;a&rdquo;, plus  a strange squirrel tail to the top right&hellip;</li>
<li>and crossing the dot of the &ldquo;i&rdquo; to make it look like it&rsquo;s not an i&rsquo;s dot?</li>
<li>why is the top and right part of this letter, as well as the squirrel tail, thicker than the rest?</li>
<li>the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is s off&hellip; the size of the (&ldquo;counter&rdquo;? &ldquo;bowl&rdquo;?) round part of the letter is tiny compared to the previous &ldquo;a&rdquo;, or the subsequent &ldquo;o&rdquo;. Looks like a transformation? &ldquo;j&rdquo; to &ldquo;g&rdquo;?</li>
<li>if this was a cover up from &ldquo;j&rdquo; to &ldquo;g&rdquo; (and the &ldquo;squirrel tail&rdquo; of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; was covering the dot of a &ldquo;j&rdquo;) then that leaves us with &ldquo;ij&rdquo; next to each other, but then the &ldquo;ij&rdquo; letters seem to be too spread apart for this.</li>
<li>the ending &ldquo;n&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really look like an &ldquo;n&rdquo;, more like another strange tail for the &ldquo;o&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m not sure what to think about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the pics are not good quality, and the skewness in the letters could be due to skin condition or photographic angle. Also, I&rsquo;m not in any way an expert in typography, and also I have no clue if the tattoos were modified or not. The police report does say they the tattoos seemed to be recent. There was apparently also another tattoo where &ldquo;A globe surrounded by letters on the left forearm. According to the autopsy report the letters were &lsquo;Illegible and not English&rsquo;&rdquo;. The pics for this other tattoo are not available.</p>
<p>Anyone in this forum would like to share their thoughts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, it says &ldquo;Virgo&rdquo;. The peculiarities are consistent with an amateur attempt to be artistic. A cross for a dot is not unusual in contexts where a simple dot would be impractical, particularly to mark it as intentional where other spots can occur.</div>
