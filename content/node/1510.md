  body: Could this be a &#39;runicised&#39; roman rather than a sans roman? Eitherway,
    It was of great interest, thanks Frederik, please show us the resulting identity.

  body: I don&#39;t know why they used two styles, only that it happens a lot  in
    old Danish type. Blackletter was the common type of the day, so maybe they wanted
    something different for the religous bit?  <BR> <BR>

  body: You will find Sans Serif too on old houses in Germany and grave stones even
    on old roman stones. Max Bollwage did an interesting survey about his studies
    at the Typo Tage 2003 in Leipzig. He concludes... some facts seems to show, that
    the Sans Serif is not an exclusiv english invention from the early 1800 century.

  body: I did some sporadic, hung-over &#40;from a David Bowie concert...&#41; research
    yesterday. It seems that these Sans Serifs were widely used as upper case, lower
    case is always blackletter. <BR>As for runes, they were out of use by 1450, which
    is quite late. By this time they echoed the latin alphabet completely. &#40;with
    which they co-existed.&#41;
