    beef with Mr Garfield, that he trivializes typography by focusing on those aspects
    of it which are most conducive to sensationalizing with his flashy wit.\r\n\r\nIf
    he were to write a book on another mainstay of civilization, cutlery (What The
    Fork?), one would no doubt discover the sexual peccadilloes of the inventor of
    \ the pickle fork, be treated to a rehash of the Macdonalds coke spoon incident,
    and the story of how Ginsu revolutionized TV advertising."

    but Mr Garfield was just on CBC Radio 1. If this means my next new client's understanding
    of type has increased even a fraction, then I'm a fan. I might even buy the book
    for my Dad."

    Sans is an error.

    are those which have missing glyphs, wrongly encoded characters, inconsistent
    character widths, unkerned accented characters, or which don't show up in the
    font menu.\r\nAlso to be considered: certain Cyrillic and Greek fonts designed
    by Westerners with ignorance of the conventions of indigenous letter forms. "

    Script was made available by American Type Founders (ATF) in 1942, and its designer
    Robert E Smith gave it a lower case with joining loops, creating a quaint and
    consistent type that looked as if it was written by a fluid, carefree human. The
    problem was, no one you had ever met actually wrote like that\"\r\n\r\nBRUSH Script
    isn't supposed to look like someone's writing. It's supposed to look like someone
    painted it with a BRUSH."

    bad design. Yet, designers still want to protect this \"insider status\" they
    had previous to desktop publishing. I kind of see typographers circling their
    wagons instead of confronting the problem. While every ignorant lay person thinks
    that if they know the alphabet they know typography. I believe this is short-sighted.
    Unless we expose the \"normal\" population to an understanding of typography beyond
    Comic Sans and Papyrus we are just going to have more of the same. Have you seen
    how popular LetterMpress is on the Mac App store. I believe people do care about
    type they just don't have many places to look...unless textbooks and reference
    guides are your thing. "

    Nothing that "qualifies" you for your particular work. The "professional" is becoming

    is wrong with writing a book to give some depth to a topic in which most don't
    even realize exist? Every typography book I have ever opened starts with kerning
    and readability, typically an instant turn-off. Think about the first time all
    of you have come across that \"aha\" moment when you actually realized letters
    and words are packed with various functionality and personalities. Did this moment
    come when you had a personal experience with type, or were you force fed principles
    of typography by someone who knew more than you? 98% of the people I know \u201Cbreath
    helvetica\u201D not only ignorant to its rich history but in addition there are
    thousands of other faces that have crazy and interesting backgrounds. This allows
    the average reader to create a connection with a typeface and then hopefully realizing
    there is much to be learned about the topic as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe book is a open
    door that invites people to learn more about a topic they didn't even know existed.
    \r\n\r\nCoffee Table Book? Sure. Successful in its intent? Yes. "

    for instance, or Avant Guard or Rotis (with which The Economist had a brief flirtation).
    \r\n\r\nThe small type in the original, great little Penguin historical atlases
    by Colin McEvedy was economical, attractive and read legibly and fluently in Times.
    Times was replaced by the higher x-height Rotis in new editions of some of the
    books. Trying to be contemporary, I suppose, they made the books look and read
    ugly: with Rotis, the sense is chopped up - it's harder to take in whole phrases
    and thought units at one time.\r\n\r\n"
