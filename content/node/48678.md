  body: "As usual, good looking font, Chris.\r\n\r\nIs your r (and to some extent
    t and f) overkerned?\r\n\r\nIf your x is going to have fluid arms, then shouldn't
    the v, w, y and z too? I guess what I'm really saying is I think the x should
    be straight. I notice now that the y is slightly curvy. Hmmmm. Love to see a pdf.\r\n\r\nN"

  body: "Nick,\r\nThe y, v, w, x, and k all have some curve to them. The x perhaps
    a bit more than the k. Part of this is setting up for the MM extremes for interpolation.
    After I do some of the between weights, I may have to revisit the x a bit.\r\nThe
    kerning is not there quite yet.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, Nick! I will post
    a PDF soon.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'I feel in lightening the font, the rhythm of widths may have gone a bit off.
    For example, the ''a'' feels to me too wide, and maybe the e. I guess there''s
    always a question, whether you go more for preserving the shapes of the counters,
    or the outside.  '

  body: "Bill,\r\nI took a midline when choosing the shape. The \"a\" may be a tad
    wide at larger sizes but is better smaller. The proportions are not humanist,
    I admit so \"a\" will seem wider than typical humanist faces. I always worry about
    the counters of a and e getting clogged and dark so feel better about making them
    open. This helps in interpolation but I may have to go back and adjust the hairline
    weight \"a\" afterward. \r\n\r\nChrisL"
