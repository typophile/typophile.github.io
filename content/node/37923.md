    Identity Manual]] online (pdf). On page 10, under Fonts or Typefaces, it says
    \"The signature is custom made, and is not available as a font or typeface.\"\r\n\r\nThey
    [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides_of_Canada#History|changed their name]]
    from Canadian Girl Guides Association to Girl Guides of Canada-Guides du Canada
    in 1961, so the logo and signature may date back to then."
