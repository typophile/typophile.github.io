body: Dear Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I have the question, which is caused by a deficiency
  in the information maybe. It is about Stem hint programming in Type one font files
  and hint replacement program. <BR> <BR>As hint-substitution points and first node
  of contour are connected &#40;I mean FontLab realisation&#41;? Is there whether
  sense to focus attention on beginning of each counter of my letter when I work with
  overlapping zones? <BR> <BR>Of course there is some information in FL Manual &#40;p.
  493&#41; but I see that when I change position of first node the hint replacement
  algoritm changes HR points too. <BR> <BR>How it works? Possibly, the &#34;Black
  Book&#34; will give the answer, but thus I could not find it. <BR> <BR>Sorry for
  my terrible English &#40;I propose the abbreviation &#34;sfte&#34;&#41;.
