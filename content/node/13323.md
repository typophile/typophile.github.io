  how \"Social issues continue to affect typography\" and he mentions the case of
  \"wholesale replacement of alphabets, as seen in recent years in Azerbaijan\". I
  was curious about this information (and uninformed) so I went and did some research.
  (Now I realize, there may be an old thread on this since this is an old topic).
  But I was suprised to learn that the Azerbaijani alphabet has been entirely altered
  four times: from Arabic to Latin to Cyrillic and now back to Latin again. Each of
  these changes was politically motivated. \r\n\r\nIf we consider that each alphabet
  has its roots in its own specific culture, is born from social and economic change,
  then how can such a distinct and culture be forced to use another culture's alphabet
  system? (Now, I do realize that one of the criticisms of the original Arabic letters
  was that they did not fully represent all of the vowels sounds, and maybe I am being
  naive here, but shouldn't a culture be allowed to express itself with its own proper
  alphabet?)\r\n\r\nComments please!"

  body: "Most of the people on the planet use 'someone else's writing system'. The
    number of writing systems on the planet is considerably smaller than the number
    of linguistic and ethnic communities. Peoples borrow, adapt and share writing
    systems across language and cultural boundaries. Only a small number of cultures
    have the privilege to still be using an indigenous writing system. Of course,
    many peoples have been using an adopted writing system for so many centuries that
    it has become part of their own culture in a real sense. They have made it their
    own through their literature, calligraphy, epigraphy, etc.\r\n\r\nAzeri has the
    same historical issues with writing systems as the other Turkic languages. The
    earliest and only indigenous Turkic writing system was the Central Asian runic
    script, which was replaced by the Arabic script when the Turks converted to Islam.
    So the Arabic script is no more 'authentic' for the Turkic languages than the
    Cyrillic or Latin, except insofar as religion is less transitory than politics
    and more deeply embedded in most cultures."

  body: "I mostly agree with John. I would however offer these elaborations:\r\n1)
    A script change can be forced from the outside, or it can be homegrown. I think
    we can agree that the former is usually bad, and the latter usually OK. On the
    other hand, it's certainly possible -as is the case with the latest Azeri switch
    in fact- for a change to be motivated by misguided intentions, and badly carried
    out.\r\n2) Some cultures put more value on their script. It's probable that Azeris
    don't mind switching nearly as much as Armenians for example would, since for
    us it's a very strong part of our identity. The Soviets didn't even have the balls
    to mess with it (although they <strong>did</strong> mess with our spelling).\r\n3)
    Languages and scripts have varying degrees of compatibility. It can be argued
    that Latin is a better fit for Altaic languages than Arabic is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In reference to Hrant first point:\r\n\r\nI think the most recent Azeri script
    switch needs to be seen in two contexts: the immediate political context, to which
    Hrant alludes, of wising to build stronger ties with Turkey and, through Turkey,
    with 'the West', but also in the historical context of the 1920s Latin script
    adoption which was, by all accounts, popular. This historical context is really
    the more interesting one, because it has to do with an internal historical dialogue:
    the re-emergence of Azerbaijani national identity in the post-Soviet period is
    explicitly linked to the brief period between the end of Ottoman domination and
    the enforced use of the Cyrillic script under Stalin. So the period in which they
    first adopted the Latin alphabet -- along with other Turkic peoples --, in the
    1920s, is seen as the period of the birth of the modern nation of Azerbaijan.
    I think this internal motivation is probably much stronger than the contemporary
    political agenda, although they are obviously linked through the much longer political
    orientation that began with Ataturk's adoption of the Latin script and the development
    of the pan-Turkic alphabet in the 1920s."
