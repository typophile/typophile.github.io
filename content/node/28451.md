body: "Dear All,\r\n\r\nI am helping with the design and production of some product
  brochures and other materials based on print advertisements. The ads have been put
  together by another graphic design/ad agency and use Monotype Neosans and some version
  of DIN (possibly the Font Font one). The layouts for the ads have minimal text and
  the choice of fonts seems to work quite well there (they are not up for changing
  either).\r\n\r\nThe other materials are quite text heavy and neither Neosans or
  DIN are suitable for the amount of text that needs to be set. Neosans has quite
  a limited character set which will cause too many problems, whilst I have a personal
  dislike of DIN and especially for body text.\r\n\r\nI would like to find another
  font or family for setting the body text which has a full(-er) character set and
  is more suited to extended reading. I think another sans font would work best as
  a serif would jar with the other two fonts. A sans is also more in keeping with
  the nature and the image of the product which is a protective device for active
  sports.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing any thoughts or suggestions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGrant"

  body: "Three differnet sans serifs sound a bit \"over kill\". I would go for just
    two. Also please note that DIN is not really meant to be used as a headline typeface.
    Why not use DIN as the body copy and Neo Sans as the headline option. Still if
    you're looking for other suggestions, two of my own designs, SOPHISTO or STALEMATE
    might fit? Have a look yourself;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com"

    body: "Stefan,\r\n\r\nI agree, three sans is a bit much, but thankfully both Neosans
      and DIN have been used sparingly. I tried setting the text in DIN but it just
      doesn't work (I readily admit that I am no fan of DIN). \r\n\r\nI have taken
      a look at both ITC Conduit and Emigre's Solex families. Solex seems to be a
      reasonable choice (some similarities to Neosans and DIN but much more readable)
      and might work quite well. Conduit is perhaps a little too quirky too sit in
      the background.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGrant"

  body: Grant, I just discovered this typeface yesterday <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo/">Camingo</A>
    it looks like it could be a good compliment, and I believe the OpenType has all
    the necessary features. This looks like a new face, and I haven't used it though.

      sans which might work quite well as body text.\r\n\r\nGrant"
