  body: Aaron, having an altercation with a fellow member doesn't justify insults.
    You don't have to resort to name-calling because Florian was being sarcastic.
    BTW your acerbic avatar will most likely elicit similar reactions from other Typophiles
    -- most of us here are designers. Maybe change it to avoid future run-ins.

  body: I know <em>I</em> can take it, but there are a number of people here who are
    quite sensitive, that's why. Plus it's not ovious at all that it's supposed to
    be tongue in cheek, and I don't know how many know that book (I certainly didn't).

    It's possible that -- as these characters are modular and geometric -- this was
    custom designed."
