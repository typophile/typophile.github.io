<div class=commentbody>I have been referring to Mr Bringhurst's book for some time (the first edition: should one upgrade, as with software?) It is very useful, but occasionally gets me into trouble. <br> <br>His advice to "omit unnecessary punctuation" is at odds (as he admits) with standard practice in North America for "Mr., Mrs., and Ms." My attempts at reform have, without exception, been met with derision from editors and clients. <br> <br>What's the practice for periods after Mr, Ms and Mrs in other English-speaking parts of the world?</div>

<div class=commentbody>BBC style is to eliminate punctuation after abbreviated titles and to turn "pronounced" acronyms (Nasa, Aids) into intial-cap nouns. It seems very clean to me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yup, that's the same Watchmen. BTW, there's a movie of it in the works. See <a href=http://www.efavata.com/CBM/Watchmen.htm target=_blank>http://www.efavata.com/CBM/Watchmen.htm</a> <br> <br>I think the second edition of Elements has plenty of nice improvements (and a few corrections), but at this point I'd probably hold out for the next version. Two weeks ago Bringhurst told me he was "finishing up" the third edition, so I'm thinking it will be just a few months. <br> <br>On a side note, of all the business/technology books I've read, <i>Information Rules</i> is the most interesting, readable, solidly thought out and well-grounded. It is to the business strategy and economics of high tech and software what <i>Elements</i> is to typography. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, thanks for the welcome. My "One day I'll be able to finally post that I got myself a..." is a digital camera. (Any suggestions for a model that combines a good balance of affordability / features?) Ditto sigh... <br> <br>"Alyce you should add your reviews to the library." Thanks for the suggestion, Tiffany. Let me spend some time with the books and CDs and I'll come up with something better than "much fonty goodness". Being a realist, however, I don't expect to match the eloquence of the existing <a href=http://www.typophile.com/books/archives/1%20Type%20Specimens.html#000055 target=_blank> "Indie Fonts" review</a>. (OK, and being a nerd, I counted the pictures to make sure the title is accurate. :-) ) <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The Canon Digital Rebels are looking VERY good. <br> <br>It's a prosumer SLR for just under 1000 dollars. 6 megapixels; very good quality images.
