  feature. I''ve got a question here: since Macedonian before 1945 was considered
  a Bulgarian dialect, should it use Bulgarian glyphs? Or it is closer to Serbian?'

  body: "Thanks George, but that's not exactly what I'm talking about.\r\nThe thing
    is\xAD\u2014in Russian and Bulgarian and Serbian there are exactly the same letters
    (not all though), but there is tradition for different glyphs for same letters.
    For example the Russian \"\u0442\" and \"\u043A\" would be the Bulgarian \"m\"
    and \"k\". There are more differences like these. I'm curious \xAD\u2014 to which
    glyph tradition does the Macedonian language below."

  body: "Macedonians are somewhat nationalistic today. This comes of being told they
    can only call themselves the FYROM, in order to avoid annoying Greece. At one
    time, Macedonian was alleged to be merely a dialect of Bulgarian, rather than
    a Slavic language of its own.\r\n\r\nSo I would suspect that even if the Bulgarian
    glyphs were used for Macedonian in the past, in the present they would follow
    the mainstream Cyrillic glyph tradition, like Russian. However, a brief web search
    did not turn up suitable examples of Macedonian printing including lower case.\r\n\r\nAh,
    wrong search term. [[http://alati.org/font/]] should do to answer your questions.\r\n\r\nWell,
    maybe not. Mak Hebar uses the Bulgarian k but the Serbian/Russian T (of course,
    they too use m in italics), while most of the other faces there seem to follow
    Serbian and Russian. So maybe the Macedonians haven't made up their minds."

  body: Thank you guys. Looks like they're mostly using the regular Cyrillic and use
    Serbian Italic style.
