    compliments the brand name - chunky, industrial etc. It may look even better if
    you reverse the logo out of a box with one side slanted.\r\n\r\n3 and four dont
    really have the same impact.\r\n\r\nhope this helps\r\n\r\nS"

    the rest of your letters are giving an extended 3d feeling except the \"M\".\r\n\r\nAll
    the best."

  body: "I LOVE the 4th one.... the type used is so inviting and warm. The mixing
    of the fake cap \"m\" and the other characters are awesome. Honestly the 1st and
    second seem too trendy to me. Being young and working with a lot of \"hipsters\"
    (haha) I see this kind of stuff all the time, of course your specimen is way better
    executed.\r\n\r\n I really like where you are going with the 4th, great work."

  body: '#4 IMO has the best potential. With a few more tweeks I think you might have
    a winner. #1,2 and 3 are nice, but feel a bit in the moment. This is what I like
    about #4: readability (I''m not feeling the font choice though), the two wing
    feather vs three and letter spacing. You might want to try the font used in 3
    and let it breath a little more and instead of the three wings use two. just some
    thoughts.'

  body: "Of the four, the type of number three looks most lokomotiv to me. Agreed
    with hola that the type should be loosened a bit for the sake of readability.
    I, too, see the Topgun thing, and am wondering if the wings were turned upside
    down they'd resonate \"train\" more than they do \"flight.\" But it'd have to
    reduced to 2 bars, because 3 might look too much like an E...and then maybe only
    use it on the right...this would suggest an industrious forward moving attitude...is
    that TOO much suggesting?\r\n"

    tilted. From turning my head, the type seemed to read a lot better. So push both
    ideas.'

    wings is nothing new either. ;o)\r\n\r\nEveryone seems to be arguing for #4, and,
    on second look, I think that's fine as well. So I'll revise my suggestion and
    say go with 1 or 4. I still think 1, while perhaps a tad trendy, is clean and
    simple enough to stand up to time."

    curves need to be sorted out. Also saw the Top Gun motif, especially in 3. Which
    leaves 1 as the best of the bunch for me, I think there is scope for improvement
    in the spacing and possibly in the line breaking.\r\n\r\nTim"
