  the typeface on this cover. I've found similar faces, but nothing that has the round
  curves that this one has. I think this would be classified as a rotunda, but I'm
  not sure. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nS."

  body: "Thank you Nick. I knew it was WC's Lydian, I know that there were derivatives
    produced but was not sure of the time line of the copies or this book. This is,
    as everyone can see, a bolder version which led me to believe, as well as agree
    with Jan, that this may be a rip or amended version... possibly \"emboldened\"
    by hand.\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's published in 1976. The original publisher is Heimskringlan. I doubt
    that'd tell you much though :D\r\n\r\nThis is the Icelandic translation of the
    Brothers Lionheart. The original version in swedish uses a different typeface,
    and the english/american one yet another.\r\n\r\nSv."

  body: "There was a bold version added in '38 but I have never seen it that I remember.
    But I would bet you that this is it... however there does seem to be a bit of
    finagling. Do not know how that figures into this piece of work. He was heavily
    into book publishing, as was his cousin, Oscar Ogg (Book of the Month Club), so
    maybe he did it himself or as I suggested someone else amended it! BTW, they are
    both from Richmond VA, USA where I live.\r\n\r\nMichael"
