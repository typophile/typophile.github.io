  body: "I've been looking for this for a while, but the funny thing about Techno
    fonts is that they all look so familiar until you try to match them. The most
    similar font I found was <a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/3885?text=SEIBERTRON\">Transformers
    Solid</a>, but the E would need to be rounded and some terminals squared off.
    It's probably a good starting point if no one finds a better match.\r\n\r\n- Mike
