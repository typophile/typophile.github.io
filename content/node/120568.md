  [[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k33290n/f233.tableDesMatieres|this essay]].
  The two lines are: \r\n\r\nHISTOIRE DE DESTRY \r\nET DU PAYS SAULNOIS\r\n\r\nThis
  issue of the journal was published in 1913, so the font would have to be at least
  that old, probably older. The page you see there is a scanned reproduction, so the
  quality isn't great, and the letter range is minimal, but at least large enough
  to show some distinctive features.  The letters seem to be designed to have a tall
  look to them. The curves on the \"D\" and the \"O\", for example, seem elongated
  on the vertical plane. The \"H\" and the \"R\" are very distinctive. The cross-bar
  on the \"H\" is about 1/3 distance from top, not center. The \"R\" has a very unique
  tail(?) that descends the baseline \u2014 sorry, I don't know all the terms for
  letter parts.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the typeface changes at least three times after
  that, so the title/subtitle are unique from everything else on the page. The first
  change begins with \"PAR  L. MAUJEAN\". You can see the \"L\" and the \"E\" here
  are different than in the main title/subtitle. The second change begins at \"MEMBRE
  TITULAIRE\", which appears to be using small-caps. And the main essay copy, beginning
  with \"PREFACE\" seems to be different yet again; the \"P\" and the \"E\" being
  obviously different than the title/subtitle.\r\n\r\nAny insights for the title/subtitle
  typeface are appreciated, even if I just knew the name."
