body: "  I wanted to thank folks here for pointing out some great specimens, giving
  me some idea about what you like and for designing some great specimens. I must
  admit that as of a year ago I didn't even really have a clue. \r\n\r\n  This is
  my latest attempt. Good, bad or indifferent, please let me know what you like and/or
  dislike. \r\n\r\nHere are the first and last pages. If you are interested in seeing
  the rest you can download the pdf here...\r\n\r\n[[http://cdn.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/42/0/21920.pdf|Eccentric
