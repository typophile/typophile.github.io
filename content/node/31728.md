  W\xF6rg\xF6tter's Type Selector: The User-Friendly Font Swatch</a>?\r\n\r\nI'm curious
  to hear reviews from those using it, and for example, how it might compare with
  older reference works like Rookledges International Type Finder.\r\n\r\nTIA"

  body: I saw it somewhere and thought for a bit about getting it. Decided against
    it, the samples were quite small, and the amount of fonts not that big. But maybe
    I just didn't understand it correctly.

  body: "I have one right here. It's a nice idea, but like Tim says, not very useful
    in practice. The swatch binding works well for comparing paper or color swatches
    because you only need to see a small segment of each page. But type is different.
    You need to see more than a few characters to properly compare typefaces, which
    means comparing fewer at one time. So the fan format ends up being more of a gimmick
    than a truly helpful. \r\n\r\nThat said, the editor picked made some good typeface
    choices (though limited) and the organization is sensible."

    mounted on the same wiro binding (similar to those amusing children\u2019s books
    that have the head, torso and legs of various characters in separate panels) which
    I thought was a good, although limited, solution, it had a full character set
    and a sample copy setting.\r\n\r\nTim"

    up my mind whether this would be a good recommendation for students, so I appreciate
    what you say about the binding and the number of samples included.\r\n\r\nTim
    \u2013 if you can remember anything else about that similar product with the slit
    pages it would be really helpful; I've not seen anything like that."

  body: "I will cudgel the grey matter Ben, it was a few years ago and I haven\u2019t
    seen it since. Although it should be relatively simple to produce something similar
    from an entire font library, two identical layouts for each typeface on an A4
    page printed to a reasonable laser printer, wiro bind the whole lot and slice
    it down the middle. \r\nLabour intensive but students have time on their hands:)
    seriously it might be possible for a college to produce their own version reasonably
    cheaply.\r\n\r\nTim"
