body: OK, I have a composition problem. I&#39;m setting the introduction to a volume,
  and the author has put a footnote as the last item of his text. That page is already
  2/3 full, and thus the &#40;long&#41; footnote runs over by 7 lines. Thus the very
  last page consists of nothing but the 7-line run over. There are only 9 pages &#40;10
  with the run over&#41;, so I can&#39;t realistically run the other pages long without
  it being obvious. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?

    run longer or shorter by just a smidge. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I pulled back the line spacing .2pt, and that did the trick. I suppose that
    won&#39;t hurt the grid too much <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: How closely is the note tied to the text? If it is really a comment on something
    about the book, the author can put it as a note to the book as a whole, on a separate
    page. If it has a specific function, such as &#39;bibliographical note&#39;, that
    can be given as a title.
