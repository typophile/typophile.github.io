  | Birmingham New Street]] on Myfonts.com.\r\n\r\nBirmingham New Street is the latest
  updated development of a typeface family inspired by the hand lettered title on
  a 19th century railway map. The map, prepared by the London and North Western Railway
  was headed \"Birmingham and environs\". New Street, meanwhile is the great 19th
  century commercial road linking the city centre of Birmingham with the train station
  of the same name.  So, in a spirit of 19th century enterprise, we present \"Birmingham
  New Street\", a fun family of three display faces, laden with open type features
  and late Victorian charm, ideal for posters, book covers and any other high flown
  design you might have in mind.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BirminghamNewStreet_Poster3_6123.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BirminghamNewStreet_Poster6_5640.png]"
