    together several of his works or is the background one of his pieces? '

    and art and a couple of fonts. <BR> <BR>Directions <BR>Place ingredients onto

  body: ' the style of the paintings lends itself very easily to this picasso-looking
    montage, where the book clipping and label for tupper look like found objects.
    however i want to see more of that interesting type treatment- but i guess thats
    because im a typophile. '

  body: I am really enjoying the layering of your imagery as well; especially with
    the vibrant colors you have selected, but I think that the composition is quite
    heavy on the right side. I think this might be solved if you moved your vertical
    type along with the beige form &#40;with David Tupper&#41; over to the left. Plus,
    I am not sure if you wanted the viewer to automatically read the text first. If
    this is what you want then the text in the middle is fine. But when I first viewed
    it, my eyes were stuck on the text and it was very hard for my eye to focus on
    the imagery. What I am saying is, the text does not move my eye around your composition.
    If the text was moved to the left, the curvature of the form &#40;with David Tupper&#41;
    would lead my eye into the right side of the piece a little more. But, I really
    enjoyed your piece! Lovely.
