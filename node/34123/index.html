  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">An introduction to myself -- so you can understand where I'm coming from.

1) i'm a student (graphicDesign/photography)
2) have not taken very many design courses
3) eager/willing to learn


So, here are the steps that I've taken -- mind you I have zero training in this department  :)


1) sketches (hundreds).
2) photograph/scans.
3) streamline/illustrator vector.
4) import EPS -> fontLab


So here's where the problem comes up. I'm vectoring the letterForms perfectly fine in illustrator. However, upon importing into fontLab, I'm finding apparitions at the ends/tips of the curves. I do not have sample images at the moment ( im at work ), however, I'll post some later. 

Nevertheless -- some questions...

1) am I following the accurate steps? 
2) are theres any webSites that can describe to me how to draw a serif typeFace



I apologize if this was a cumbersome post, and thanks for reading through. Also, thanks in advance to all who respond.

attached are some early sketches...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm no expert on fontlab, but it's system of drawing bezier curves is different than illustrator so that could account for the differences. When that happens to me I usually just edit the glyph in fontlab because I like its drawing tool better for typefaces.

And here is a website that is good for beginers.

Your steps seem fine. What is causing the vector inconsistencies, I don't know. You can also try to just copy paste from illustrator to FL, but that also is not the most accurate way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Why is copying and pasting from Illustrator to FL considered less accurate? That's what I've been doing, and it seems to work fine.

In FL I make a box from the baseline to the cap height line and I cut and paste it into Illustrator. In Illustrator I scale my alphabet so the caps match the height of the imported box. Once all the letters are scaled up I can cut and paste them into FL and they are all the same relative size.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The trouble with pasting Illustrator paths into Fontlab lies in Fontlab's strict use of coordinate points. In Illustrator, you can place a node and it's control handles anywhere and adjust them in very fine increments. In Fontlab, the nodes and handles can only lie on its grid system of unit coordinates. For instance, if your Fontlab file is using a 1000 UPM value, the nodes must sit somewhere on a grid based on one thousand units per em square. 

When you import or paste a path from Illustrator, Fontlab will nudge the nodes and control handles into positions that fit onto the grid, basically altering the shapes just a bit. If you're seeing changes in the fine details of your curves, maybe set your Fontlab file to a higher UPM value (the new Cleartype fonts use a 2048 value, for instance) and see if that translates the Illustrator paths with greater accuracy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Or, save steps and just work in FontLab. We use Illustrator because we're used to it; FL is much better for putting a typeface together. FL has auto-trace tools and will save you time. Just let go of Illustrator, learn the FL tools and you'll be happier. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Working directly in Fontlab will definitely causes fewer headaches, yes, especially once you adapt to how its drawing tools work.
