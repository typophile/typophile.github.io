  bold (which is fairly bold). No italic which is a shame but I think what is there
  is pretty decent. Has anyone used this in any projects? Anyone have any opinion

  body: "The ampersand is kinda fugly and the Q reminds me of Thesis and the W and
    w both have an apex problem and the t falling below the baseline looks more like
    a mistake and the bold weight just looks extrapolated. \r\n\r\nAm I being too
    harsh?"

  body: "I was going to use it for a project; I think it's pretty nice, actually,
    but the t sort was too distracting, for lack of a better word\r\n\r\nAller's also
    very nice, and sort of complementary, but there the k and x stick out a little,
    for better or worse (although I do like the Aller &). \r\n\r\nI think they're
    both nice, although it depends on what you'd be using it for."

  body: The t defiantly catches the eye, this is fine in larger display settings for
    me. I was actually directly comparing it with Aller earlier today. I'm looking
    for something for a client who wants the be the 'fresh' and 'edgy' cliche (although
    I do like their genuine attitude). I was favouring Colaborate because of its thin
    face and ability to have a lot of contrast with the bold. I personally like Aller
    better except the blocky serif (is there a name for this?) on top of the i and
    j annoy me a bit. I think it works better on the capital J. The a, b, g and l
    are what I really enjoy. The italics have a nice treatment too.
