    three possible approaches:\r\n\r\n1. typewriter\r\n\r\n2. handwriting - but an
    old-school script kind of writing - P22 Declaration is in the right direction
    but maybe too formal. A lot of these photos have writing on them, it's script
    but not so flourishy. \r\n\r\n3. Fonts that were in common use for printed matter
    at the early part of the century, such as Century Old Style, Cheltenham Old Style,
    Caslon 540.\r\n\r\nAlso you might try to keep the design in line with the look
    of the period, centered type (at least the headlines), nothing too flashy. Keep
    in mind the limitations of metal type. A broadsheet type of design could be nice.\r\n\r\nAlso
