body: I saw this lettering on one of the traincars when John Kerry made his whistle
  stop here in the grand town of Winslow, AZ. I&#39;m afraid i was more fascinated
  with the lettering than listening to Mr. Kerry speak. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t
  have a camera on me. I was wondering if any of you would have photo samples of this
  lettering or have suggestions on how to go about finding such samples. Any help
  would be appreciated. Thnx. <BR> <BR>p.s. The California Zephyr is an old Amtrak
  line, the best information i could gather was at a <a href="http://calzephyr.railfan.net"
  target="_blank"> virtual museum</a>. they had pics of everything but the lettering.
  Some great 50s brochures to look at though! <BR> <BR>p.p.s. if anyone knows of a
  font based on this lettering &#40;or fairly similar&#41; that would be great to
  know too, thnx.
