body: "Greetings! A strange issue in a font created in FontLab:\r\n\r\nFrom the same
  vfb file I have generated both ttf and otf versions of the font. In the otf version
  there is spurious inter-character kerning within Uniscribe applications; this does
  not occur in other applications, e.g., TeX. \r\n\r\nCompare the screenshots linked
  below. The second line contains repetitions of the character U+0640, which is exactly
  the width of a monospaced box. In the ttf shot you see the repetitions form a continuum,
  whereas in the otf shot they are discrete. Looking at the Latin letters on the first
  line the spurious kerning is also apparent. (You may ignore the hinting discrepancies).\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone here ever run into anything like this before? Any ideas? Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/almfixed-ttf_5778.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/almfixed-otf_6388.jpg]"
