  body: If the gray is a percentage tint of black, you don't need to trap it. If the
    gray is a separate/PMS color, why not make the D 100% black + 100% PMS color?
    Then you wouldn't need to trap, either...

    two stacked D-s and multiply?"

  body: 'Add a stroke to your PMS 486 the size requested by your printer for the trap.
    (Remember that the stroke is only half hanging off your shape, so double the thickness
    of the outline, or set the stroke to ''outside''). Then outline the stroke: object>path>outline
    stroke. Now duplicate your black object, bring it to the top of the stack, use
    it to divide the outline (just the outline, using the pathfinder tool), and erase
    the parts that do not overlap the black. Now you have the trap.'

  body: "I think it is the printers problem,\r\nsorry, might sound a bit blunt but\r\notherwise
    you have to adjust your \r\nlogo for every printer you are using.\r\n\r\nUsually
    the printers have software\r\nlike Heidelberg's pdf toolbox\r\nor Trapwise which
    will do the job\r\nfor you\r\n\r\nDo you use Indesign at all?\r\nThere is an easy
    trick do get\r\na trapped PDF."
