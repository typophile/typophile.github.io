    looks close, but the bold weight changes the E, so not sure.\r\n\r\np@"

  body: Definitely Palatino... something weird going on with the 'G', but definitely
    Palatino... could it be 'faux' bold?

  body: "Well, Palatino has serifs on the centre bar of the \u2018E\u2019.\r\nI have
    to admit the sample looks Zapfish. I thought Aldus as well."

  body: How old is this sample? There were photocompositor versions of Palatino from
    various vendors.

  body: I don't think it's very old. It's part of a logo for a local rock products
    company. I'm not sure how long they've been around. I have a hard time believing
    a company like that would have custom lettering in their logo, but I guess anything
    is possible. I ended up redrawing the letters using the sample above, and I used
    Palatino Bold for the subcopy.

title: looks like Palatino, but the E is different
