  blogs, so called, experimental sans serifs. I noticed certain similarities in the
  glyphs of those typefaces and, although I can see some roots in scandinavian runes
  and art deco typography, I wonder where such distinct features that you can see
  in R's came from.\r\nI would be grateful if anybody points my research in the right
  direction.\r\n"

    body: 'I''ve seen that blog. I wouldn''t have posted a question here without researching
      first. Collecting is quite an important activity, however without critique and
      contextual/historical study it''s a mere collection of visuals and links. That''s
      why I decided to ask here.  '

    body: "I guess I didn't make myself clear. Neither I'm looking for such typefaces
      nor I focus on experimental typography. I'm seeing the similarities, a certain
      system behind those \"experiments\", and I wonder if there is indeed a source
      of this trend.\r\nOne can point me in Paul Renner's direction. And that would
      be possibly the first step of research. However I can't find the next step.\r\n\r\nThanks
      everyone for comments anyway.  "

  body: "It\u2019s nice to see the return of pure plastic invention.\r\nIn the early
    days of digital, it occurred because the \uFB01eld of type design was suddenly
    opened up from its turgid, closed-shop state, part of a general turmoil in the
    graphic arts as the masses got hold of cheap new tools.\r\nNow, I would say it\u2019s
    more because the \uFB01eld has become so heavily cultivated, with every foundry
    \uFB01lling out its repertoire of the genres, that it\u2019s hard to be distinctive
    if one hoes the same rows as everyone else.\r\n\r\nAlso, the mind-numbing conservatism
    of the post-grad type design schools must at some point couple with the  servile
    mentality of foundries churning out their corporate workhorses to provoke a backlash
    of design for the sake of it. \r\n\r\nMy perspective is systems-oriented (Marxist/ecological/technological),
    the idea being that we don\u2019t just create in relation to other artefacts,
    but also as agents operating in economic and social systems.\r\n\r\nWhile it may
    look like these types are samey, the more you look, the more you see. \r\nFor
    instance, one distinction is between those which are embellished with overt decoration,
    and others which are minimal in form, but with the elements con\uFB01gured in
    unusual ways. "

  body: I agree with nick that while superficially there are a lot of simularities,
    but there is still some good stuff there, which is more refined in the details,
    playful, not simplistic. In fact, the same can be said for every type category.
    The cream always rises to the top.

  body: karl nawrot's work when he was studying at werkplaats typografie, around 2008.
    a font has appeared in the last few weeks on the website tendollarfonts.com that
    has a horrible font called "simon sans" that is just a whacky composite of rp's
    fugue, colophon's raissone and karl nawrot's otik. though it mainly borrows liberally
    from otik.
