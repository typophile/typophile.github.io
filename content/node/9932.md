body: 'new to font creation <BR>this font came from my sketchbook. <BR>i hand drew
  each letter, then scanned <BR>into photoshop, cleaned it up a bit, <BR>then vectorized
  it in Flash 5, then sent <BR>eps images to illustrator and finally to  <BR>Fontographer,
  <BR> <BR>is there an easier way? any critique will be appreciated. thanks<!--attachment:
