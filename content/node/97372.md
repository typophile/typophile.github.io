  some examples of use of fleurons, decoratives, embellishments fonts and so on?\r\nI'm
  particularly interested in use with TeX, but any other technology is wellcome.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks."

    is the result of your initial post being in any way stupid but perhaps the result
    of no one having seen it that has anywhere to point you. I am intrigued by the
    possibility of seeing what you are asking for but have never seen this myself."

    answers a question. Some folks don't read the forum daily.

  body: "Casellese, \r\nNo one thinks your post is stupid. You should not think that.
    On this forum (or any forum) posts are subject to the inexplicable vicissitudes
    of internet interest.  By the same token, do you \"deserve\" an answer. No, because
    posts are subject to the inexplicable vicissitudes of internet interest. Let's
    hope for the best.\r\n\r\nOne reason for a lack of replies may be the generality
    of your post. Are you looking for websites about in-print or about on-the-web
    use of fleurons? Your mention of TeX hints at in-print use,  and maybe you could
    clarify further. Are you interested in fleurons in book text or book chapter headings
    or magazine advertisements or wedding invitations or something else? Are you interested
    in fleurons that are part of a font? Or png or other graphic format fleurons?
    Sometimes being specific about your interest or your goal can lead to more interest
    in your post.\r\n\r\nMy experience indicates that if you are forced to bump your
    post to try for a response, it's best to wait more than 24 hours to get the best
    bump for the buck. I think you have one more legitimate bump left and it starts
    with \"Let me clarify what I am looking for...\""
