    adds a little more decor, but add a judicious shadow and you can get close.

  body: "Thanks, Stephen, for your suggestion. CAC Valiant is even closer.\r\n\r\nChristmas
    Cake\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS:\r\n1 cup of water\r\n1 tsp baking soda\r\n1 cup of sugar\r\n1/2
    tsp salt\r\n1 cup of brown sugar\r\n1 tsp lemon juice\r\n4 large eggs\r\n1 cup
    nuts\r\n2 cups of dried fruit\r\n1 bottle Jose Cuervo Tequila\r\n\r\nSTEPS:\r\n\u2022
    Sample the Cuervo to check quality. Take a large bowl, check the Cuervo again,
    to be sure it is of the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink.\r\n\u2022
    Turn on the electric mixer...Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl. Add
    one teaspoon of sugar..Beat again. At this point it\u2019s best to make sure the
    Cuervo is still ok, try another cup ... just in case.\r\n\u2022 Turn off the mixerer
    thingy. Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried fruit,
    pick the frigging fruit off floor... Mix on the turner. If the fried druit gets
    stuck in the beaterers just pry it loose with a drewscriver. \r\n\u2022 Sample
    the Cuervo to check for tonsisticity.\r\n\u2022 Next, sift two cups of salt, or
    something. Who giveshz a sheet. Check the Jose Cuervo. Now shift the lemon juice
    and strain your nuts. Add one table. Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever
    you can find.\r\n\u2022 Greash the oven.\r\n\u2022 Turn the cake tin 360 degrees
    and try not to fall over. Don\u2019t forget to beat off the turner. Finally, throw
    the bowl out, finish the Cose Juervo and make sure to put the stove in the dishwasher.\r\n\r\nCHERRY
