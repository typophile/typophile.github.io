  well as text faces at a small point size whilst squeezing as many words into a line
  as possible.\r\n\r\nI am currently setting Univers condensed (8pt type / 10pt leading)
  but was looking for any suggestions for typefaces that meet the requirements above
  whilst being a little easier on the eye?\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

  body: 'Fedra is also very good, including the serif I think. Also of course ''agate''
    type, specifically designed for small size, like [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/PoynterAgate|Poynter
    Agate]] and the one by Tobias Frere-Jones, whose name escapes me at the moment.
    And then if you want to go nuts on small, there is Biblio of Storm. '

  body: 'Note that a narrow typeface doesn''t necessarily get you more words for the
    same legibility. You may be able to shrink more in size a wider face and still
    be legible. And if you have more than one line, you may be able to stack the lines
    with less leading. IIRC, Stephen Coles here has pointed to Amplitude as one that
    works very well small. '
