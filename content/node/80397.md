body: I've never really used Illustrator and I'm wondering if it's possible to create
  a vector image of a glyph that shows all the nodes and bezier handles as strokes.
  Basically I want a function to render the following image as a vector file. The
  nodes I can colour myself. Perhaps there's a plugin?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g
