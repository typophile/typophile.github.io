  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Over on <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/34792.html">this thread</a>, I imagined some new approaches to glyph spacing (inspired by some suggestions from Laurence Penney on comp.fonts some years ago) and possible tool interfaces for 'kern-free' spacing. For the time being, though, it looks like we're stuck with kerning, and the metal type metrics paradigm that makes kerning necessary. So, having spent a lot of the past three weeks kerning, here is my dream of the perfect kerning 'environment', the Pankernopticon. <BR> <BR>One of the major problems of kerning in typical font tools like Fontographer and FontLab on typical computer monitors (even very high resolution screens like <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=-840&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=9503DG5&amp;storeId=1">this one</a>) is that rounding errors make it impossible to accurately preview the effect of kerning adjustments in context. In order to accurately preview the kerning, one needs a one-to-one relationship between screen pixels and the upm height of the font. For a typical TT font with a upm of 2048, this means that one needs to preview the kerning at a sufficient size such that, if the whole height of the em is to be seen onscreen, the minimum height of the kerning window is 2048 pixels (ignoring for now the fact that one often wants to see stuff beyond the limits of the em height). In a smaller window, one can zoom in on the type, so that it is large enough, but then one cannot see the context of the kerning pair or even the full height of the glyphs. In order to accurately preview kerning in a useful way, one would need a monitor that is tall enough to display one pixel to one font unit, and wide enough to display a string of letters in a sample word or sequence of key letters. So the central feature of the Pankernopticon is a very large, wide screen, say 2,400 pixels high and 19,200 wide. <BR> <BR>In order to properly view letter sequences on such a screen, one would need to be at an appropriate distance, as in the cinema, and the screen should curved to avoid perspective distortion at the extremes. The operator would be seated at a console at e.g. 25 feet from the screen. <BR> <BR>The console would be similar to a video-editing suite. The main controls would be a character selection tool, probably a pointing device, a keyboard for entering text strings or stepping through pre-loaded kerning word lists, and a Kerning Dial. The latter is the means for adjusting the space between two letters on the screen. <BR> <BR>The chair would be comfortable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; the minimum height of the kerning window is 2048 pixels <BR> <BR>But you have to remember that virtually nobody kerns down to the EM, not even in 1000 units. I'm certifiably anal, and I only go down to 2 (in 1000), and usually I stop at 5. You might say that 5 is an odd number so you need the single-unit addressability, but that's a decimal hang-up; meaning that I should just use 4 or 6 instead. So a height of 1024 (assuming TT) is plenty, I think. <BR> <BR>But I agree on the necessity for width, even though it's about as far away as the technology in Minority Report - or maybe not: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3688569.stm" target="_blank"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3688569.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3688569.stm</a></a> <BR> <BR>There's something else, too: to me the biggest factor in quality kerning testing is the &quot;data&quot; of what should surround the pair at hand; control strings are too far removed from real language, so we need to formulate lists for each pair that are based on the (relative) color density on each side; like for &quot;av&quot; you might have &quot;ravish&quot; (tight on both sides), &quot;beaver&quot; (loose on both), etc. The good news is this is cheap to do. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I use sample words for kerning Latin, Cyrillic and Greek, and plan to make lists for other scripts/languages as I find time or as projects require.
