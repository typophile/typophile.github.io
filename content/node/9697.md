  body: 'I doubt seriously that anyone reads an annual report in the same way as they
    read a book.  They might scan the text and focus on the financial statement tabular
    material to find what interests them.   <BR>The type of an annual report should
    reflect the company it is for. Think of the difference between Ben&amp;Jerry&#39;s,
    IBM, Avon, Harley-Davidson, Disney, Whole Foods, IKEA, Victoria&#39;s Secret,
    Colt Firearms, Smuckers, and John Deere. <BR>I have asked on this forum how much
    difference does the cold hard data show in readability between a good sans and
    a good serif face and never been answered.  I am looking for a usable measure
    like: &#34;Serif face x has been proven to reduce reading time for a 100 page
    continuous text book &#40;a novel&#41; by 5% over sans serif face y.&#34; <BR>We
    all have our personal favorites and those we hate.  I get a headache when reading
    more than a paragraph of Optima.  I love the way Bodoni looks in large sizes but
    tire of reading it in long text.  My 2 favorite text fonts to read are Adobe Garamond
    and FF Din--find me the logic in that pairing. I don&#39;t claim to be typical
    of the majority of readers and don&#39;t cram my favorites down my client&#39;s
    throats.  <BR>Unlike several years ago when there were far fewer choices, today
    there are thousands of faces and several of them are good. There is one heck of
    a lot more to readability than sans vs serif.  We don&#39;t even know if the serif
    issue is the most important.  I think leading and line length mean much more but
    I have no hard data to prove it. <BR> <BR>Oh well, I&#39;ll shut up now. <BR>

  body: Oh yes--one more thing--CONTENT!  <BR>The nature of the content has a way
    of either making us want to read more &#40;if we find it interesting&#41; or making
    us want to yawn and quit &#40;if we find it boring&#41;. <BR>If I ownwd a bunch
    of stock in a company, I would be interested in the annual report and read it.  If
    it were a company that was of no interest to me, I would not read it.  This is
    where design, white space, and photos become a big help.
