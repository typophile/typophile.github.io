body: This is a portion of a jewelry store logo, but I'm not able to determine the
  exact font to re-create it.  The image was taken from an outdoor road sign.   Can
  anyone help me identify the exact font used?  This would have been around the late
  1970s or early 80s the sign was created.   Even a font that comes as close as possible
  will be acceptable, but preferably, the exact font would be nicer.  Thanks for your
  help!
