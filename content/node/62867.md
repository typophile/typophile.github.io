    anything except the F.R. DAVID title. Even most of those letters are not too disctinctive
    for identification purposes. Could be Caledonia, among many other choices.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I would agree with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bulmer/|Bulmer]],
    except the Bitstream version, which has too much of a tail on the R. I can see
    now that New Caledonia at least has too small a tail on its R.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
