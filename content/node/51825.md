  body: PDF attached in the first post. I guess my type language isn't all that precise.
    I assumed letterspacing refered to the loosening/tightening of text. Please enlighten
    me! (And please forgive the sudden change of type. I just realized this had to
    be more friendly.)

  body: "Well, I use \"tracking\" to mean that. And kerning is something you really
    do in a font, not in a setting. But frankly the terminology isn't so clear cut
    - people adapt and improvise it all the time.\r\n\r\nMove the first \"R\" a hair
    to the right.\r\nLoosen \"EA\" a hair.\r\nTighten \"RK\" slightly.\r\nTighten
    \"KE\" a hair.\r\n(Where \"slightly\" is about twice as much as \"a hair\".  :-)\r\n\r\nBTW,
    if this is going to be set pretty large, I'd remove the trapping (the pulled-in
    curves intended to lighten joins at small sizes - like in the \"armpits\" of the
    \"N\").\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
