  answer why. does anyone know? i'm referring to the red slash...does the RE imply
  realtor? and i'm assuming that that typeface is avant garde, but why? \r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: That is a bizarre question. One might suggest that "it is the way it is" because
    the designer of the logo was taking advantage of the alternate characters found
    in Avant Garde. Yes, I would also think the RE refers to REALTOR and the MAX refers
    to their ability to get you the MAXIMUM return on your sale.
