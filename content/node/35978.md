body: "Epochal. \r\n\r\nThis is a word I randomly ran into today while looking for
  synonyms to the word periodic. I was extremely intrigued by it and decided to play
  around. At first I felt like I was heading in a direction I liked... a lot. I started
  with some Saul Bass and Simplicissimus images for inspiration and went from there.\r\n\r\nI
  want something bold and a little bit retro... but I also want something original.
  I am going to try and base a web project on this word now and really want it perfected
  before I move on. I am pretty happy with where the logo itself is right now, but
  not at all happy with the color combinations. I like red, yellow, and black... but
  I feel like that is nothing new.\r\n\r\nAny comments or suggestions would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso: def - extremely important, significant, or influential.

    \"CH\" how it shouldn't be pronounced. Maybe put the split between 'H' and 'A'.\r\n\r\n

  body: How about a fuschia/pink and black. I also agree it reads 'epo chal'. I think
    you might run into this issue no matter how you address it. But dividing it like
    Lex said might improve readability or at least draw emphasis. It's an interesting
    word though and like the design approach.

  body: "Thanks a lot for the comments guys. Lex, I misread your post and put the
    space between the C and the H... and kind of liked it. Hola, I was thinking that
    too, but yesterday when I was playing around with it I felt that it gave it a
    completely different attitude (one that I didn't want.) But after reading your
    post today and playing with it, I do kind of like it. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    here are a few more editions:\r\n1. Original in pink.\r\n2. Using same spacing
    but trying to make it a little more readable.\r\n3. A try at Lex's suggestion.\r\n4.
    A try at what I thought was Lex's suggestion. heh[img:sites/default/files/old-images/epictest2_5711.jpg]"
