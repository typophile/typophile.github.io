body: "Hi everyone\r\n\r\nAny sugestions to what would be the best font to use in
  a Bible. The format will be pocket size so the size of the font will have to be
  small, probably between 6 and 7. Traditionally bibles have two columns, but i might
  use one since its quite a small format.\r\n \r\nSo far have experimented with \r\n\r\nWarnock
  Pro (I like its optical font)\r\n\r\nFrutiger (a fresh and youth feel to it)\r\n\r\nKepler
  \r\n\r\nAny more suggestions...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSorry, if i have post this
  in the wrong place, I am new to this forum..."

  body: "\"<a href=\"http://www.hiberniatype.com/Parable/parable.html\">Parable</a>
    is a versatile serifed face for serious typography. It is optimized for print
    in small text sizes (between 6 and 10 point). Yet, some of its features prove
    to be interesting characteristics at larger sizes also: such as the \u2018dug-out\u2019
    shoulder junctions of h, n, m etc, and the thin midriff of lowercase g (designed
    to avoid filling in at small sizes).\r\n \r\nParable has low stroke contrast,
    making it robust and adaptable to many circumstances, and it has a proportionally
    large x-height for optimum legibility in text. The italic provides a strong, cursive
    contrast to the roman, and attention has been paid to giving it a distinct identity,
    with quite different forms for certain characters of punctuation (see margin).
    With small capitals, and bold & extra bold weights, Parable is equipped for all
    kinds of complex typography.\"\r\n\r\n"
