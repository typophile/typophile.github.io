body: "I am looking for Serif fonts where the R has vertical leg. The serif can be
  slab or Clarendon style like OL Contact Classic [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OLContactClassic_R_3587.gif]
  or Superba RR Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuperbaRRBoldHaas1928-30_R_3537.gif]
  or Map Type [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MapType_R_3881.gif]  but without
  the small curve on the inside of the leg of Aachen Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AachenBold-R_6022.gif]\r\nI
  was only able to find three examples. Perhaps there are no more?\r\nDon"

  body: I just stumbled across [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/12135043/LuxorRev|Luxor
    Rev]] this morning. From what I gather, it had a past as a wood type. Terry Koppel,
    a past Art Director at Esquire, had [[http://www.identifont.com/show?J08|Ann Pomery]]
    digitize it and Koppel [[http://www.tkoppeldesign.com/type|currently has it up
    for purchase]] on his site.
