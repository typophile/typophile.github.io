  Also is Sweet Sans a derivative of Sackers Gothic? They look very similar. \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/sackers-gothic/\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/sans/\r\n\r\nI
  believe Sackers was made in '94 & Sweet Sans after that, but I'm not sure. These
  look like early 20th century Engraver's fonts, but I'd like to know the type design
  origin, or what at least inspired it.\r\n\r\nBL "

    of answering your questions.

    derivative of Sackers Gothic based upon the description, I was just curious as
    to the source of the original specimen. \r\n\r\nWhich foundry? what designer?

  body: "<blockquote>My guess is then that the designer of Sweet Sans had permission
    to make a derivative of Sackers Gothic</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhy is that? Do you
    know the origin of Sackers Gothic? I can't seem to find any info on it. In any
    case, even if Monotype's font was the first engraver-style sans to be digitized
    doesn't mean it has any special permission from an original designer. In fact,
    it would be very difficult to find an official source for any typeface in this
    genre. It was a common, standard style used by many engravers. Something like
    a sign painter's style or architectural lettering.\r\n\r\nLike Marc said, I think
    the <a href=\"http://mvbfonts.com/sweet_sans/design_info\">Sweet Sans design description</a>
    is pretty clear about sources (though I'm biased because I wrote it), but the
    font maker, Mark van Bronkhorst, should get you any more information if you require
    it."

  body: I don't have very clear information on this; but, to the best of my knowledge,
    Gary? Sackers was a stationer who approached a photolettering studio in the fifties
    or sixties to create a phototype version of the popular 'block' style from engraver
    masterplates. Allan Haley might know about the transition from Compugraphic to
    Agfa to Monotype, but my understanding is that a digital version was drawn from
    the phototype. The Sweets comprise a collection of many different engraving styles
    as interpreted directly from the plates, including Sweet Sans. So they look quite
    similar because to some extent they share original sources.
