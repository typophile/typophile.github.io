  that often fonts get picked on for overuse (see Archer) yet somehow I notice that
  \"Brothers\" by Emigre gets used more and more and no one seems to notice. To quote
  the great Mugatu \"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills over here!!!\"\r\n\r\nI understand
  that it is a very nice looking font that has become immensely popular even though
  it is over 15 years old. What bothers me is that it seems to be taking advantage
  of the fact that a client might not notice that their Microbrew label looks EXACTLY
  LIKE that other microbrew label. I even read a piece in a well-regarded logo book
  where a design firm claimed to find the \"Logotype\" from researching old shipping
  crates, when it is clearly BROTHERS!!!\r\n\r\nWould love to get others thoughts
  on this....should I just give up and put Brothers on everything?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Given that John Downer, the designer of Brothers, is a sign painter by trade
    (with undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine art), I\u2019d guess that he
    brought that hand-made aesthetic to his design for Brothers. That doesn\u2019t
    rule out the possibility that his references included type found on old shipping
    crates, and that your microbrew logo designers worked from similar sources. \r\n\r\nIf
    you can provide the name of the brewery (or the logo book), I\u2019d love to compare
    it to Brothers.\r\n\r\nBut you are quite right about the ubiquity of the style.
    I see it everywhere these days. Much like the \u201Chipster\u201D logo style that
    involves some form of crossed line elements and \u201Crustic\u201D type, the steampunk/woodcut/hand-carved
    aesthetic of Brothers (and typefaces like it) has become shorthand for \u201Cauthentic.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll
    to entice young professionals with too few frames of reference and too much disposable
    income to spend three times the going rate for a basic cast iron frying pan (a
    la Best Made Company). \r\n\r\nResist the urge to resort to shorthand.....\r\n"

    a bit challenging of traditional gender roles \u2013 now embodying a faux ultramasculinity
    is all the rage, with the so-called \"lumbersexual\" trend. Brothers is almost
    always used in applications which are socially constructed as tediously, single-mindedly
    masculine in contemporary society; no matter its orgins as neutral, slightly refined
    signage, it's now reduced to boorish, unrefined clich\xE9. "

  body: "jvankriedt, the Fidelis Co. logo is a nearly 95% match to Brothers (about
    as definitive a match as you can get with image recognition software and a relatively
    small sample image).\r\n\r\nJohn Downer is based in Iowa City, Iowa (though he
    is from the Pacific Northwest). I\u2019m not buying the Fidelis designer\u2019s
    tale of \u201Cnineteenth-century product crates.\u201D\r\n\r\nBirdseeding, I agree
    about the gender connotations of such branding. I signed up for Best Made Company\u2019s
    emails because they are beautifully designed and I wanted to understand how they
    were constructed/programmed, but they engender more disbelief and humor than product
    lust. $100 for a 6\" cast iron skillet? Ridiculous. And what urban bohemian needs
    to spend $300+ on an axe? (and why would they need one?). "

  body: "The Fidelis Co. logo simply uses Brothers bold. It is in no way hand-lettered
    or invented.\r\n\r\nNow, that doesn't mean the designers <em>didn't</em> look
    at 19th century crates. They may have done that, then found an existing typeface
    that perfectly embodied that aesthetic."

  body: "I'm the designer of the Fidelis Co. Brand. Of course the typeface used is
    Brothers! I simply wasn't asked which typeface it was in the interview. The spirit
    I used Brothers in was indeed <em>inspired</em> by typography on antique shipping
    crates.\r\n\r\nBrothers is a strong display typeface, especially when used to
    convey a specific visual language. It was perfect for this particular client and
    business, at the particular time that the mark was designed. I agree that this
    style of typography has recently exploded into ubiquity, and I love that Brothers
    is a 15+ year old typeface enjoying a newfound popularity.\r\n\r\nAs the owner
    of an all women-run design studio, I'm highly enjoying the investigation into
    Brother's connotations of \"socially constructed as tediously, single-mindedly
    masculine in contemporary society\" etc. I don't disagree. Those connotations
    work perfectly with the business this mark represents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
