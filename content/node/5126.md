  the font from the old paint scheme of Turkish Airlines. <BR> <BR>Here are two samples:

  body: Thanks for the quick reply but it isn&#39;t that. The original font doesn&#39;t
    have serifs. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another sample. I&#39;m not sure how true to
    the original this is, so please consider this to be a sort of backup. <BR> <BR><a

    it&#39;s the basis of one of Macromedia&#39;s custom corporate fonts, so you can
    get an idea what it looks like from there ads, etc. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a scan

  body: <i>...Soo Extended.</i> <BR> <BR>Ha! I forgot about that one. I&#39;m into
    model railroading somewhat and remember running across that once. As I recall,
    that was done by Rick Johnson, who often does these amazing technical illustrations
    for <i>Model Railroader</i> magazine. Not the most faithful version I&#39;ve seen
    of a  font, but it does have a full character set and decent spacing &#40;not
    usually true of free fonts&#41;.

  body: Yeah, Venus is an old favorite of mine. I used to get it in Format &#40;cut
    out lettering sheets&#41; and Letraset sheets. I did one my early business cards
    with it, although I didn&#39;t really know how to use it correctly at the time
    &#40;way too tight&#41;. It used to be you could only get the extended weights
    and condensed weights, now you can only get the others.
