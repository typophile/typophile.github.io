  Type Family will be released today!\r\n\r\nGerusa is a technical sans-serif typeface
  family by Loligovulgaris.com.\r\n\r\nIt features a 1000+ glyph set per cut, with
  (almost) monospaced uppercase and text-suitable lowercase characters, a very complete
  set of diacritics, math glyphs, greek and a full range of OpenType features.\r\n\r\nThis
  family is OCR and ISO inspired, with an engineering/architectural feel, robust and
  pragmatic, with the usual technical ugliness chopped away.\r\n\r\n<strong>Gerusa
  Medium and Gerusa Medium Italic are available for free!</strong>\r\n\r\nYou can
  check it here:\r\n[[http://loligovulgaris.com/?p=357|Gerusa at Loligovulgaris]]\r\n[[http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Gerusa-Type-Family/284676|Gerusa

  body: "I like it's ugliness, it reminds me of some of my Fontstruct experiments!
    ;-)\r\nBut I think you would do better showing the roman and then advertise that
    there's also an italic. That in order to take advantage of the resurgence of the
    octagonal fad (at least judging by the type ID's requests).  "
