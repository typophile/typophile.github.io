  fonts for books, particularly non-fictional books, in a particular region, for example
  a particular country, for particular dates? The typogeography of europe map is something
  like that, but I of course need a timeline on font popularity. \r\n\r\nIf not how
  would you go about discovering this information?\r\n\r\nI am thinking particularly
  of historically popular fonts in Denmark.\r\nI do not need a 100% accurate result...a
  result that tells me that a particular font was likely high in popularity at a given
  date would be adequate.\r\n\r\nDates might be as far back as the 1750s to today.\r\n"

    research, starting somewhere like the [[http://www.kb.dk/en/|The Royal Library]].

  body: "Do you mean popular in a lot of Danish non-\uFB01ction books, or popular
    in popular Danish non-\uFB01ction books?\r\n\r\nWould that be popularity as measured
    by number of books printed, or by the number read?\r\n\r\nHow does the number
    of editions factor into this?\r\n\r\nFor titles or body text?\r\n\r\nYou see,
    I don\u2019t think it is possible to accurately answer such questions.\r\nThe
    usual method is to accept the opinion of an expert, which is little better than
    anecdote, IMO."

  body: "Over 12,000 books were published in Denmark in 1996 (the latest year the
    article had stats for), so I doubt if anyone is keeping track of overall font
    usage. But perhaps if you contacted some of the major publishers, you might find
    someone willing to give some guidance.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per_year"

  body: "In the English-speaking world, non-fiction typography, depending on what
    field one is looking at, has tended to be dull, at least at some levels.\r\n\r\nToday,
    almost everything is in Times Roman. Yesterday, science textbooks were overwhelmingly
    in Modern series 7 because of the availability of mathematical symbols from Monotype
    in that typeface. And if you go back to the 18th Century, Caslon was used for
    just about everything.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you go to non-fiction books for which
    a huge popular sale is anticipated, more will be invested in the typography. Times
    Roman is still quite likely, but you could get Baskerville, you could get Palatino...
    or you could even get Optima or Univers, particularly if the book is concerned
    with the arts rather than the sciences.\r\n\r\nCaledonia and Century Expanded
    are more likely to be found as alternatives to Times Roman for works of fiction,
    although they're used for non-fiction as well.\r\n\r\nBut there isn't enough effort
    expended on a more diverse range of typefaces in huge swaths of the book publishing
    industry. Magazines, as vehicles for advertising, receive more attention in this
    regard."
