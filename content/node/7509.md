body: I&#39;m new to typography and I&#39;d really like to get my hands on some metal
  typefaces play around  and get my hands dirty, I&#39;ve searched the net and so
  far all I found was some 6pt Helvetica on e-bay. <BR> <BR>Does anybody know of anywhere
  in London that I can buy some faces either 2nd hand or new???

    <BR> <BR>There&#39;s always some type on eBay, but: <BR>1&#41; The keywords vary,
    especially among people who are selling stuff they don&#39;t understand. Some
    people for example use the term &#34;hot stamping&#34; to mean lead type.  :-/
    <BR>2&#41; Be careful of crappy ones. Like there&#39;s this guy who sells them
    heaped in plastic bags... <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something decent: <BR><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=46735&amp;item=3849892871&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW"

    <BR> <BR>Also: besides avoiding Helvetica outright, I would recommend staying
    away from very small sizes. Not because they&#39;re useless, but because they
    might sap your passion for typesetting. I know I personally hate fidgeting with
    the really small stuff. <BR> <BR>hhp'
