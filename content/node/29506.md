    the Yale font as a knock-off and now this. The Windows and Pre OSX Mac rednering
    (standard antialaising - no ClearType) is how the font was designed to be rendered.
    Fortunately the font also works well under ClearType, and was even considered
    for use in the Microsoft eBook Reader product. '
