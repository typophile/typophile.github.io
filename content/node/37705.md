  like the simple symbol (G). Please explain how I could improve it. \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Nice, but I find that something isn't in place.\r\nIMO, you have two options:\r\n1.
    make the \"pixel\" G (nice) more like the one from the font you used (by \"condensing\"
    it, so to speak)\r\n2. use a font with a G more like the pixel one you made (you
    used Helvetica Neue Condensed, but the pixel G does not look like a condensed
    font).\r\n\r\nBye\r\nA."

  body: "The text should line up with the 'G' inside the box. Also, I wouldn't recommend
    combining raster graphics with vector graphics unless you need to incorporate
    a photo. It's easy enough to redraw your 'G' logo as a vector graphic, which will
    help eliminate the anti-aliasing around the edges.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "First of all. Your symbol and text in the logo don't align with each other.\r\n\r\nANd
    I guess the rasterized G is to closed. The serif on top shouldn't go that deep.
    Get one pixel out. Or even half a pixel. Who's gonna know...\r\n\r\nOr maybe to
    make things a bot sophisticated. Take your rasterized G and use it as basis for
    a more smart sign. Cut some sides at different tha 90 deg angles etc. Don't overdo,
    so it should still look like that base was raster letter.\r\n\r\nOh yes. And definitelly
    vectorize the G as Lex suggested. It should be very easy."

  body: "Thanks for all comments. I've made the symbol into vector now. I will probably
    leave the symbol as it is.\r\n\r\nThough, you have all right that the font to
    the text (brand name) isn't fitting. I tried to experiment with \"orphan\" and
    \"bandwith\" (pixel fonts) together. But I didn't get satisfied. \r\n\r\nDo you
    have any ideas on a font I could use? When I used Courier New (which is a bit
    pixly), I got the objective impression that the company was a news database."

  body: "I thing the first version was better. Font choice was going better with the
    symbol. So was its size. I don't see any bigger difference in the symbol though...\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you don't rush into print just yet."

  body: "I never liked double symbols. One is on the left an another on the letter
    \"i\". Why is always my reason... Do they complement each other? I don't see the
    connection.\r\n\r\nI liked the original more than any subsequent solution."

  body: "I don't like they way there is a 'g' followed by another 'g'. It reads badly.\r\n\r\nI
    find that the 'g' in the box is erroneous. Try to tell a story about the service
    through the logotype."

  body: "Pixelated fonts represent a lack of resolution, and to me it seems rude to
    flaunt that as a virtue. Especially a design virtue. \r\n\r\nMerely a reminder
    of crummy technology. (I wish I had been allowed to smash my first computer to
    pieces with a sledge hammer)\r\n"
