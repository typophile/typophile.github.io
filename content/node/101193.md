  fonts. I'm not a fan of either, but I don't think they go well together either.
  But i'm not sure. What do you guys think? What should I recommend? Any other font
  you'd recommend instead?\r\n\r\nHe's requested two options:\r\n\r\nMongolian Baiti
  with Copperplate Gothic Bold\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_6469.png]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nFelix
  Titling with Copperplate Gothic Bold\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B_4954.png]"

  body: The first one could work (felix titling is way to thin on the 2nd). Try shrinking
    the subtitle a bit and tracking it out to match the spacing of the main title.

  body: The second one gets too thin but I like where it is going, the lines of the
    eye are replicated in the font below. Keep at it.

  body: "Copperplate, IMHO, doesn't work well at that size nor with such tight letterspacing.\r\n\r\nGranted,
    I don't think Copperplate works well with others at all. \r\n\r\n"
