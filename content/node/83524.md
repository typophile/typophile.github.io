  deadline (of course!) and my design existed in only one form: A Letraset sheet.
  (If you're under 50, [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed6iXQW_O1U|click here]].)
  As I picked it up, the letters began to curl and peel off the sheet, and they fell
  to the carpet, where they stuck fast. That's when I awoke in a cold sweat.\r\n\r\nTell
  me, fellow typophiles, what typographic terrors haunt your sleep?"

    had a dream the other night that I was designing a newspaper page, and as I worked,
    things kept moving around and it was like I could never finish. It's not quite
    a typographic nightmare, but I figured you guys could relate somewhat to it :D"

    them up, and IMMEDIATELY spotting something wrong \u2013 and checking back you
    find it was wrong on the proofs but you didn't spot it at the time. Argh."

  body: "Dave, here's a true story from the days of rubber cement.\r\n\r\nI once worked
    for a textbook publisher who published a book about behavioral science, and the
    author's first name was <em>Theadore</em>, not the more conventional <em>Theodore</em>.
    We hired a freelancer to design the cover and when he submitted his sketch, someone
    looked at it and said \"The author's name is misspelled,\" but we checked and
    it was correct. \r\n\r\nWe had the designer make the mechanical, and when it was
    done, someone else asked, \"Is the author's name spelled right?\" After verifying
    that it was, we sent the mechanical to the printer, and when the printer sent
    their proof, the same thing happened: The spelling of the author's name was queried,
    and yes, it was supposed to have an <em>a</em>.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, the
    bound books were delivered, and copies circulated throughout the office. An assistant
    in the Marketing department came over to Production with a copy of the book and
    said, \"<em>Behavioral</em> is spelled wrong!\"\r\n\r\nWe looked at the book,
    the printer's proof, the mechanical, and the sketch, and on every one of them,
    it said <em>Behaviorial</em>. We had all been looking so hard at the author's
    unusual name, no one had seen the error in the title."
