  logo will contain letter \"a\" but the problem is that it has to look like it has
  derrived out of same typeface that is used for writting musical dynamic indications
  which are: piano, forte, mezzo-piano. Does anybody know which typeface is used for
  these indications? I do NOT need typefaces used for writing musical notation!!!
  because there isn't any \"a\" in it. I need a typeface that looks like the one in
  which piano, forte and mezzo-piano are written. \r\n\r\nI will attach how they look
  here.Pay attention that they are written in CURSIVE so I need my \"a\" in cursive
  as well:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/400px-Dynamics_svg_4146.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6d9f75b5188c8824a1254dae144bf36e_4648.jpg]"

  body: The exit and entry strokes and slab-like serifs without brackets are typical
    for modern serifs like Bodoni or Didot. An alternative with less contrast is Walbaum.

    to the style of dynamic markings?

    that has all the musical notations. It's been a long time since I've done this

  body: "Paul, I believe a musical notation font is what Dot said they don't need.\r\n\r\nThis
    is interesting. Frode is right but it's not quite un-tricky. Many Bodonis/Didots
    don't have the soft/\"scripty\" instrokes in the italics; but then <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/baskerville/\">some</a>
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves/bold-italic/waterfall.html\">Baskervilles</a>,
    which would seem like good matches otherwise, have the semi-ascending \"p\".\r\n\r\nHere
    are a few faces whose bold italic cuts look like they might work:\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\">Scotch
    Modern</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-731/\">Century

    Bodoni Old Face BQ</a> (quirky \"p\")\r\nAlso nice: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/teimer/\">Teimer</a>

    may only exist exactly in that form in fonts created specifically for musical
    notation and thus missing what you need. aka, it may be impossible to get a perfect
    match. However, Altaira makes some good suggestions, so hopefully one of those
    is close enough."

    I figured \"a\" in Scotch modern is practically \"p\" upside down (with just some
    smaller differences)so I just took \"p\" out of music notation type and turned
    it upside down and drew \"a\" out of it. This is how it looks now.\r\nWhat do
    you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new a_4675.jpg]"

  body: "Hm\u2026 dunno, I'm hesitant to comment without seeing the entire composition/logo.
    I'm pretty convinced the fonts I recommended would look neater / more harmonious
    than the \u2013somewhat disjointed*\u2013 letters from your sample (and it's *exactly*
    the \"small differences\" that can make all the diff really\u2026). One would
    have to see the whole thing to be able to judge whether your \"sampled\" one looks
    neat/coherent/harmonious enough, or conversely, if a different typeface would
    look \"music-like\" enough. Make sense?\r\n\r\n*I mean look at those weights!"

  body: Altaira, here is comparison with Century 731 and Scotch Modern- "a" is in
    both cases copy of "p" upside down. Only in Scotch Modern the difference is in
    angle of this flat part of "a" (don't know how it's called -is it stem?)and length
    of it. In Century731, even the angle is the same, so I did the same in my case.

  body: "I see what you mean, and sure that \"a\" can work as an \"a\".\r\nMy question
    was more about what other glyphs will be in your logo, and if these funky letters
    from your sample will be able to do the job, or if a more \"polished\"/\"normalized\"
    typeface would be better for the overall impression of the logo. There's really
    no way to tell that by staring at a single \"a\"."
