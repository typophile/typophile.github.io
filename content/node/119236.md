  is a font by Claude Pelletier, based on based on \u2018Frutiger Bold\u2019. \r\nBut
  I'm not sure about which font it is. Any clues?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    his fonts at alt.binaries.fonts\r\nThey are compiled at http://abfonts.freehostia.com/\r\nGo
    to the author tab and you will see his name. There are 49 fonts listed under his
    name. Run through them and you will soon determine if your hypotheses is correct.\r\nIf
    this does not work you could ask him at the Dafont font ID forum.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "So you don't have do all the work I suggested. Just find Essai. In my experience
    if a font is by Claude it's an original work and not a rip of another digital
    fontmaker. Claude has been making fonts for many years, and has sometimes used
    Diogene as a name. Don't expect a long commentary from him. He is rather Laconic,
    perhaps Diogene is a play on the ancient Greek philosophers. \r\nDon"
