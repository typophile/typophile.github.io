  having seen before:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=century+751&q=Go\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/century_751/\r\n\r\nNamed
  Century 751 and designed by Rudolph Ruzicka in 1953, it is said to be \"Bitstream's
  version of Primer.\" There's a connection to the Fairfield shapes, but I wonder
  if anyone has any info or sample of the typeface \"Primer\", or if anybody has ever
  had the chance to use the digital 751. Thanks!"

    Bitstream digitization.\r\n\r\nI have a couple books in my collection which use
    Primer. Here are two images for you (not to scale). Note that the first example

  body: "Century 751 was included, along with a wide selection of other Bitstream
    fonts, with the Corel office suite at one point, so probably many people have
    it on their computers. The proportions are like those of Century Expanded, but
    in addition to being lighter, it has a larger x-height.\r\n\r\nCentury Schoolbook
    is heavier than Century Expanded, and has a lower x-height - as well, the lower-case
    letters have a normal shape instead of being somewhat condensed. My suspicion
    is that Century 751 is intended for use at small sizes in newspapers or classified
    advertisements and the like, as it has some of the important characteristics of
    a legibility face.\r\n\r\nEDIT: However, the examples given in Kent Lew's post
    don't match the impression I got from the Bitstream version; they show Primer
    as being very suitable as a beautiful book face."

    It's a lovely face and seems quite readable.

  body: "Christian, the Primer typeface featured in Kent Lew's books samples is a
    metal typeface, and unfortunately a faithful digital version is not available.
    Bitstream's Century 751 is a \"lighter\" version, also missing small caps and
    old style figures, and, generally speaking, very weak if compared to the original
    source (there also seems to be a digital version by Linotype, named \"Primer\",
    but I couldn't find any info or sample). At very large size, for titling and display
    purpose, Century 751 seems to work, but not really as a body text (I can send
    you a sample page to show you, if you're interested). What strikes me more is
    Primer's shapes linking to the Transitional heritage, Baskerville among all, which
    it makes different from the \"strong\" look of Century.\r\n\r\nA couple of years
    ago there was some interest in a new digitization of Primer, and I think this
    typeface deserves it - you can check an interesting discussion in this thread:
    http://typophile.com/node/34046 But, as it often happens with this kind of type
    revival, the marketing request isn't strong enough.\r\n\r\nOn another level, and
    speaking of Century, there's an interesting version made in recent years by Mark
    Simonson, named \"Grad\" - very different from Primer, and with a very idiosyncratic
    italic, but it looks like a nice, working digital Century for setting books:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marksimonson.com/article/102/introducing-grad"

    and apparently Carter, Berlow et alii ripped off these Ikarus font files and sold
    them as \"Century 751\" (\"Copyright by Bitstream\"). Since Ikarus files of \"Primer
    Bold\" had not yet been made by Linotype at that time, Bitstream could not rip
    them off."
