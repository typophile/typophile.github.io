  body: "This looks to me like a customized version of Trade Gothic, News Gothic,
    Benton Sans, Franklin Gothic, etc. But if you're looking for a face that has some
    of the distinctive characters already included...\r\n\r\nAkkurat has the curved
    l but not the one-story g.\r\nhttp://lineto.com/\r\n\r\nFlama has the curved l
    and one-story g, but DIN-like construction.\r\nhttp://vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights/\r\n\r\nFoco
    has the desired features but adds a hint of calligraphic construction.\r\nhttp://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/foco\r\n\r\n"
