  CS3. I saved it\r\nonly in an \"ai\" file. Last night, my complete system crashed
  and I had to reinstall \r\neverything. Now I tried to open my work and it sad, that
  Lily UPC font is missing, and\r\nit opens the file, but the text is full of with
  missing character boxes. \r\nCan anyone tell me, where can I download Lily UPC (or
  just simpy email me the upcll.ttf if you have got it), or with whitch program comes
  it together? (On my previous system there was a lot of demos installed, with Windows
  Vista Ult. Now i installed WinXP. Prof.) \r\n\r\n\r\nIt's very important for me,
  becouse the customer has already accepted the plans and waiting for the finished
  work... \r\n\r\nThanks and sorry about my poor English.\r\n\r\nMate"

    additional fonts via the language and regional options control panel - should
    be two options one for complex scripts and one for East Asian fonts - select both.\r\n\r\nCheers,
