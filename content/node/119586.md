  Philip\" trailer (more samples within the trailer).\r\nNot sure if the ligatures
  and swashes are original, though.\r\n\r\nThanks! Best,\r\n\r\nJuergen[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Listenupphilip_6293.jpg]"

    4 letters from the swash with the rest from the regular.\r\nI can't recall the
    name of the designer of the original Caslon-style photo-typesetting font.\r\nDon"

  body: "The original is called [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/b/benguiat-caslon.html|Benguiat
    Caslon]] by Ed Benguiat for Photolettering. A recreation is at [[http://www.photolettering.com/letterer/?layout=BenguiatCaslonPlain|Photolettering.com]].
    Cabernet JF not being on Veer's site is news to me. Nick Curtis's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/emfatick-nf/|Emfatick
    NF]] is also based on Benguiat Caslon, it's currently available for purchase.\r\n\r\nThe
    movie being from 2014, I'm thinking they used Cabernet JF."
