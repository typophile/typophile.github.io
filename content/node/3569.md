  body: The book may well be extremely rare and obviously worth that much to at least
    two parties. It was just a few grand more than I would have considered paying.
    <BR> <BR>I was struck that for a listing of  a type specimen book, there was a
    curious lack of type specimens shown. I am sure the seller was in shock at the
    final price.

    who pay that kind of money are collectors - they have little interest in the content.
