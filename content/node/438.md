  body: Hrant&#39;s paraphrase above comes from Dwiggins&#39;s <i>Layout in Advertising</i>
    [Harper and Brothers, New York, 1928]. In the section on Type, he begins <BR>
    <BR><blockquote>&#34;What type does the architect of advertising elect to use,
    and why? That question is the acolyte&#39;s invariable first prayer for enlightenment
    -- phrased always in one of the various voices of despair -- what type shall I
    use? The gods refuse an answer. They refuse &#40;sacrilege though it be to say
    it&#41; because they do not know. <BR> <BR>&#34;The gods of advertising turn their
    backs. Can we -- left to our own resources -- get any hints from the specimen-books?
    -- from the treatises on type? -- from schools that teach printing? -- from the
    lectures of experts? We cannot. <BR> <BR>&#34;We have left, then, only one course
    to pursue -- to learn from the advertisements themselves.&#34;</blockquote> <BR>

    Hebrew is written in, as this is Aramaic, not Hebrew. The ancient Hebrews picked

    were straight line fonts, scratched in clay, like Sumarian. These originals were

  body: Oh-Oh. I am getting too good at this faux Talumd stuff. It turns out there
    is actually a Rabbinic discussion of this. The Ten Commandments begins with the
    word &#39;I&#39;, and the Hebrew in the Torah is &#39;anochi&#39; instead of the
    usual word for &#39;I&#39;, and the Rabbis speculate that this was in the people&#39;s
    dialect, not yet the Hebrew of the Bible.  <BR> <BR>But wait, it gets better.
    The Jewish mystics, the kabbalists, thought that each &#40;Hebrew, = Aramaic&#41;
    letter had a mystical significance. Here is a contemporary book on it, available
    also in delux edition. <a href="http://www.jewishlights.com/books/001.html" target="_blank">http://www.jewishlights.com/books/001.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>But wait, it gets still better. The mystics thought that you could study
    a passage of holy text until the words became meaningless and the letters formed
    into new messages, and the adept would soar in mystical ecstacy.  <BR> <BR>Of
    course there was also &#39;practical Kabala&#39; in which with the right Hebrew
    incantations you could do magic, such as bringing the dead to life. For example
    the english &#39;abracedabera&#39; means in aramic &#39;I create as I spoke&#39;.
    So with the right combination of names of God you could do the miraculous. Apparently
    you would practice on something like a dove.  <BR> <BR>It occurred to me that
    you guys who are always working designing letters are doing something like the
    mystics did to reach the higher realm. Of course, this is all nonsense. But if
    I read later in the Inquirer that dead parokeets were mysteriously brought back
    to life near to the ATypi conference, I will know, I will know.   <BR> <BR>

    A late coming pretender. But you are on to something. For the Torah to be Kosher,

    part is that he must inscribe every letter with an awareness of &#39;irat shamaim&#39;,
