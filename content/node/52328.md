body: "Will Fontlab interpolation work better if I remove overlaps from my fonts before
  creating the MM face (see photo below)? I leave lots of overlaps in my fonts to
  make adjusting them easier, and I\u2019ve been told in the past that leaving the
  overlaps will reduce the problems caused by interpolation. Is that generally true?
  And is the time saved by leaving the overlaps in really going to be an advantage
  over the time spent making sure that they match across the fonts before I combine
  them?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/interp_4906.png]"

  body: I almost never keep overlaps (I keep them on the background), since I have
    started to design letters with both FontLab and the aid of other vector software
    (mostly FreeHand) at the same time, but it seems to me it's better to keep the
    overlaps (or the separate forms), as I have seen this way the blending of forms
    works smoother (I mean in creative stages, not related to the Multiple Master
    facility, which I don't follow).

  body: "Overlapping paths can be very useful during the design stage. Consider these
    two A's:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AA_5267.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf you
    needed to change the thickness or height of the crossbar, which one would be easier
    to work with? Or if you wanted to make the top narrower (more pointed)?"

  body: "Yes, I wrote it badly. I mean I never keep the overlaps as the final form
    is decided.\r\nAfterwards, I move them to the background and keep the finished
    outline.\r\n\r\nWhen I use Freehand to draw, I usally keep different stages or
    parts of the letters. I find useful to work on a separate drawing programs to
    have the possibility of coloring the filled letters, and compare many different
    letters without having to go in and out glyph windows."
