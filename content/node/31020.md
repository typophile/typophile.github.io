body: "I'm interviewing for a job tomorrow at a small weekly newspaper  -- it's a
  non-profit that I wholeheartedly support, and therefore I'd love the work. It's
  a solid job with a twenty-year-old company, and the people are amazing pioneers.
  \ Furthermore, it's a job I want badly because it's 100% telecommute --- this is
  invaluable to me so I can help take care of my dad (he has the Big C.)\r\n\r\nHere's
  my problem. \r\n\r\nThe publication is the freakin' ugliest, pastel, comic sans,
  clip-art sprinkled NIGHTMARE. I swear to god they would publish in neon puff paint
  if the could find a way. \r\n\r\nNormally, I'd see this as a fabulous opportunity
  to elevate the quality of their award-winning editorial content and help bring them
  a whole new market share ... but, alas, I see the hot-pink and lime-green logo was
  designed by the woman who is interviewing me (the \"Creative Director\").  The logo
  includes a red lipstick \"kiss\" instead of the letter O.  It looks like something
  my seven-year-old niece would draw on her notebook in crayola markers - the scented
  kind.  This woman owned her own design firm, for twenty years, shockingly, so she
  obviously in entrenched in her \"style.\"\r\n\r\nHave any of you had positive experiences
  with such obstacles? Should I just keep job hunting? Is there hope for the scented
  crayola lovers? \r\n\r\nAlaskan\r\n\r\n"

    to turn this publication around, and even if you could influence it in a way that
    would make it semi-tasteful the basic design language of this type of publication
    is something you loathe. So keep looking. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n  "

    same green and pink you discussed. It is new in comparison to the one you are
    interviewing for.\r\n\r\nIf you want the job -- you have to like where you are
    working. If you are unhappy with their \"design\" decisions, it may not be for
    you. However, if they are looking to hire new blood, and in the interview you
    find out they are wanting to revamp the newspaper -- you may find this is the
    perfect job for you.\r\n\r\nTake a few deep breaths and remember to listen. Find
    out who they want, what they want, where they were and where they plan to go or
    grow. Then try to reach your conclusion if this is a job for you.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
    remember John Stuart Mill. You know what you like and what you can be educated
    to be good at, spend your life trying to reach that goal. \r\n\r\nAnd the very
    best of luck to you."

    with them about their crappy design decisions, because they have two arguments
    that they'll fall back on over and over. \r\n\r\n1. We're doing it to save money/changing
    it will cost money we don't have. \r\n2. <em>We're saving the world</em>, so it
    needs to look like this and who are you to come along and...\r\n\r\nNeither of
    these is an easy argument to win. If you can deal with the headaches go for it,
    but otherwise it will be a nightmare."

    \  I've learned that the position I'm interviewing for is not layout - it's advertising.
    So, I'd be designing the ads they sell to merchants (etc.) which may not be as
    bad.  \r\n\r\nI'll let you know how it goes!"

    is why I'd avoid it. Unless you want to fight all day (and some do), it will likely
    be a nightmare. Or it'll take a loooong time. I was involved in taking a non-profit
    theatre advocacy group from a very MS Word-by-a-secretary look to a professional
    and successful non-profit institution. But I did it all pro-bono and worked exclusively
    with the executive director. It was so great, and increased their profile and
    membership with no additional promotion. In your case, it sounds like a vast difference
    in style and preference, rather than a lack of training. You may be right that
    an updated design will help them, but they may not be ready to make that change
    yet."
