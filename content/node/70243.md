  Would I set up a different .vfb starting from my regular and do all of my lighter-than-regular

  until past Wt1, and then it would switch to interpolating between Wt1 and Wt2)?"

  body: In FontLab, you can only have beginning and ending masters on any particular
    axis. You can extrapolate, but that's difficult to control. If you want more than
    two masters along an axis, you need something like Superpolator.

  body: Although, there is sort of a workaround for FontLab. If you add a second axis,
    you can go from, say, light to regular along one axis and from bold to regular
    in the other. In order for this to work, you need to duplicate the "regular" master
    in both axes, which means you will "waste" a master and also have to make sure
    to repeat any changes you make in the duplicated master. It really gets to be
    impractical if you want to add, say, a width axis on top of this. Superpolator
    is much more flexible for working with interpolation.

    credit their Multiple Master interface is also very simple. But it has some irritating
    bugs that can impact your workflow and the nature of multiple master technology
    limits one's ability to do some cool multi-axis extrapolations that Superpolator
    does really well. "

  body: "Workflow with Superpolator is based on .ufo, which is an xml-based exchange
    format for font development. You get the fonts in and out of FontLab using Python
    scripts (which are included with RoboFab tools and/or Prepolator). \r\n\r\nIf
    you have both FontLab and Superpolator running at the same time, when you update
    the .ufo from FontLab, it automatically is reflected in Superpolator. (This is
    also true of Prepolator.) You can also update, from within FontLab, glyphs that
    have been changed in the .ufo or import .ufo's generated by Superpolator or whatever.\r\n\r\nThe
    only major problem is that reading and writing fonts to .ufo can be a bit slow,
    especially when you need to do a whole font with hundreds of glyphs, since it's
    done with interpreted Python within FontLab.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the
    new version of FontLab (coming soon, I hope) will natively support .ufo, which
    should make working with external .ufo-based tools much smoother."

    Leming\u2019s UFO Central app (included with Prepolator) handles the job faster
    than the Robofab or Superpolator scripts."

  body: "MetricsMachine is very good. I find it makes me more thorough and systematic
    than when I do kerning in FontLab. If you do use it, it's pretty much an all or
    nothing deal. You can't very easily do some of your kerning in FontLab and some
    in MetricsMachine. \r\n\r\nFrom MetricsMachine, you can export either to a feature
    file or an afm file. In the latter case, the kerning is expanded to simple pairs,
    rather than classes, and the number of pairs can be quite large. If you export
    a feature file (which makes more sense usually), you just copy and paste this
    into the OT editor in FontLab. There's no kern table and you completely bypass
    FontLab's class definition system, etc. There is also no need to worry about \"key\"
    glyphs (which are a FontLab thing, not an OT thing). Once you have the kern feature
    in FontLab, the only way you can see the kerning in FontLab is in the OpenType
    Features Preview panel.\r\n\r\nIt's a very powerful app designed to do one thing
    really well--manual kerning. Some features I haven't even tried yet (like \"transformations\")."
