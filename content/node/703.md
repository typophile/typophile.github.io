body: Please identiry fonts for Squire and Bear only. I got other parts down. <BR>
  <BR>I know they have different &#34;r&#34;s and &#34;e&#34;s, so Squire and Bear
  must be in different fonts.  I hope this is not handwritten. <BR> <BR>Thak you!!!

  body: David is probably correct... but the UC &#34;S&#34; and the q u and i that
    follow it could be <BR>Shelly Allegro. The UC &#34;B&#34; is not. While the ampersands
    look identical, <BR>the lc e&#39;s and r&#39;s are significantly different...
    good challenge.
