    Vanessa.\r\n\r\nHello Vanessa and welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nI like the purple
    one with the circle and the putti (cherub), but you cood do more with the type
    there, and add a few small details, like a shadow or something coming off the
    putti. Also the size of the putti may be a bit large relative to the circle. Making
    him smaller will add refinement and give it a more polished look.\r\n\r\nThe script
    logo in cyan is nice but kinda neither here nor there, if you know wot I mean.
    The squiggly line around \"Vani\" doesn't look like anything specific so I presume
    it is abstract but I'm not clear on wot it represents, so that may have a mystifying
    effect on spectators, leaving them scratching their heads.\r\n\r\nKeep working
    on the purple one with the putti. Good potential there.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "I prefer the green script Vani in the circle. The colour needs to be rethought
    and refining the visual elements a bit more. The small line at the bottom of the
    circle looks out of place. The cherub on the other hand means nothing to me.\r\n\r\n@James:
    I believe it's supposed to be the end of a guitar."

    one</strong>\r\n\r\nI get: music, almost a 1950s feel, I think of Fender Guitars.\r\n\r\nI
    think that to me, this represents somebody who is classical, jazzy, modern, musical
    and probably a fun person\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Purple one:</strong>\r\n\r\nI get:
    classical, roman, artistic\r\n\r\nI think that this one communicates somebody
    who is quiet, classical and mature.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to see them, and bigger
    next time. (I can handle big images) keep it up!\r\n"

  body: "<strong>@James</strong>\r\n\r\nI don't know what you are hoping to accomplish
    by that post, it feels very sarcastic and counter-productive to me, and is unlike
    any of the other insightful and helpful posts I'm used to seeing here on Typophile.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Oh.
    Thank you. The headstock of a guitar.</em></strong>\r\n\r\nWell, not just any
    <em>headstock</em>, I do believe we're looking at a Fender Stratocaster 6-in-line
    headstock, to be exact.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Good guess. It\u2019s sufficiently
    obvious, surely.</em></strong>\r\n\r\nOh I'm sorry, I must have missed the bit
    where it was explicitly said that is was for herself, would you mind quoting that
    from the original post for me, I'm obviously too blind to see it.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Not
    really Roman.  Not even Greek. Putti are a later .... invention</em></strong>\r\n\r\nWow,
    I had no idea that the words it reminded me of were in fact <em>not</em> the words
    it reminded me of.  How fortunate for me that you know better what it made me
    think of than I do thanks to your extensive knowledge on <em>Putti</em>, which
    are <strong>not</strong> Cherubs by the way if you were to actually look them
    up for yourself.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>But you figured it out anyway</em></strong>\r\n\r\nDid
    I?  I haven't heard back from the OP to see if the impressions I got from viewing
    her work were in fact the impressions she was trying to give.  Of course I figured
    out what it made <em>me</em> think of, I just don't know how close that is to
    what she intended.\r\n\r\n<strong>@James</strong>, I think there are a couple
    of things here, 1) you can't be sarcastic and rude unless you're willing to be
    entirely devoted to the facts first, because the smallest little factual error
    in your rant turns what would have been a mean elitist remark into just a bitter
    and uninformed comment amidst a forum of helpful and nice people.  That's the
    kind of thing that breaks our hearts and have pity for you.\r\n\r\n<strong>@Vanessapoka</strong>,
    well, I hope this hasn't scared you away, there are plenty of nice folks here
    on this forum who would love to help you, keep us updated with your revisions
    as you keep working on these.  For future reference, posting a PDF or an image
    about 500-800pixels wide is a good medium size that's small enough to see all
    at once, and big enough to get a good look at the logo.\r\n\r\n<em>Best of luck,\r\ninnovati</em>"
