<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all!
I was just listening to a [[Typeradio]] Podcast - Typophile's own BaldCondensed talked about using typefaces you personally dislike (or aren't particularly keen on) - forcing yourself to use them - consequently keeping your design work fresh... Does everyone else have their own method to keeping/maintaining a fresh approach to their design work? It hit home with me because I have become selective in my old age (28) which means that I've got a set of favourite typefaces I use, I'm set in my ways with grids, and I've just realised (I couldn't quite put my finger on it before) that I'm not striving to push myself further...
Thanks Yves, I'd stayed away from the fonts I didn't like - and people are going to give me stick for this - serif faces have pretty much fallen right out of my font palette! I'm going to try and stick a few in my next project and try and appreciate them a bit more!
Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess it can be like ffishing lures. There are a few in the tackle box you've had great bites on, and you find yourself reaching for them again and again.
That's not bad in and of itself, though. Certain typefaces just have a resonance with certain designers, and it's natural, just like having favorite musicians, painters, etc.
But the real FUN starts when you stumble upon something new or overlooked and see the beauty in it. To that, I'd say, try a new font. Experiment with a bold you've never had much use for before. It's fun, and helps you stretch. But in the end, understand the "right" type for a particular piece (which you can only determine with a broad exposure to faces) -- not using something just BECAUSE you don't like it or think it doesn't work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I know it's hard, but whenever possible avoid dipping into your bag of tricks.
If you approach a project as a unique problem requiring a solution, you can keep a fresher outlook. Bucky Fuller was great for throwing out preconceived answers in order to stay open for discovery.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I once used a face which I didn't like at the time (Copperplate) on purpose on an antiwar poster. I did it because I was trying to show war as an ugly thing. I even deconstructed the font to push the negative side of it to me. As much battering as I did to Copperplate, changing the stems to look like spent brass, it held up quite well even when used small! I ended up with a new-found respect for the face and no-longer dislike it. (I might try to find it and post a link if anyone is interested.)

OK, I found it. Here are 2 links. One is the poster and the other is a PDF of the glyphs I drew based on Copperplate:

<div class=commentbody>Thanks guys for your comments... I think Hrant's hit the nail on the head...
I think my compromise would be a trip to London (I'm based in Derby, UK) so I can get out and see some design/general cool things to inspire me. I can't afford traveling around abroad because I'm broke!
Does anyone know of any London-based design exhibitions coming soon? London seems to be geared to fine art - the Design Museum's the only obvious choice. Anyone know places off the beaten track that are good to go and take in?
Ta very much!

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Lauri. It was a very quick project, typeface and poster in 4 days. As part of the bargain, I had to learn Photoshop and Fontographer. Needless to say, I was a very busy fellow day and night.
I did it in Camden Maine in about 1994 in a class with P. Scott Makela.

<div class=commentbody>I find looking at other people's design sometimes inspiring and sometimes depressing. It pulls at me to become a copy artist.
Get a divorce from your method. I think ruts almost alway start when sitting in the cool glow of a computer monitor. Make a potato letterpress piece by cutting woodtype into a half of potato.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks everyone for your comments and suggestions - I've turned the corner (hopefully!) I seem to go through 'I can't design' patches every so often - I think that's what it was, it just seemed to be a long stretch! I haven't made it to London yet, but am looking forward to in the next month or two. Unfortunately I've missed the design festival...
Phil Baines' walk looks great... Just got to convince my Finacée that it's preferable to going shopping down Oxford Street!
Not sure how much call there is for vegetable lettering, but I quite liked it!
