body: "Hello people, just a bit of fun and extremely useful for my dissertation research!\r\n\r\ncan
  anyone find a font or a single character from a font that would represent a human
  being? does a typeface or a single character represent yourself and your emotions?
  \ \r\n\r\nAn example: The font Baskerville, the letter g in lowercase: Fragile,
  gentle, delicate, soft, lightweight, fashionable, fun.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baskerville_5744.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBusinesses
  and companies choose a font that represents themselves and what they do, why cant
  a font represent us!!!\r\n\r\nLook Forward to your response"

    but it's impossible for me to resist sending the link. Hands down the most beautiful
    alphabet I've ever seen. I learned about this while taking in an interview on
    [[http://www.typeradio.org/loudblog/|Typeradio]]. Now we are talking!\r\n"

  body: Yes, is it a bit literal! but a nice link! need to find typefaces or characters
    that have certain human characteristics, like how would an big, dark, tall businessman
    be portrayed in a typeface?? a dumb blonde girl! or a little geek! do you understand
    what i mean?? different fonts convey different meanings and perceptions and i
    think this could work with my idea.

  body: "And this might be a little more narrowly focussed than what you're requesting,
    but the first (most obvious) \"character\" that comes to mind is the lowercase
    i. A quick look at my options led to this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iiiiii_3575.jpg]\r\n\r\nthoughtful
    (gill sans ultra), uptight (trade gothic medium), distinguished (goudy old style),
    pragmatic (monotype.com), articulate (garamond), and boistrous (cooper black)"
