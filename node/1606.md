  body: But not from the original by Saul Bass. <BR>I guess this is from a not very
    well done reproduction of the poster &#40;copyright 1996&#41;, for some release
    or special show. <BR>Your post is a little dark, do you have another one? <BR>
    <BR>I post anyway two versions of the original just in case... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18455.jpg"
