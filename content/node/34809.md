  body: Check out the Olympian and you'll get some new Midwest design ideas for decorating
    your office. Panelling is all the rage in wherever the hell Indiana is.

  body: Yes very good designers 'you can't go wrong with putting your favourite font
    all over your office and using another like Times New Roman and panelling your
    office with wood.

    it was a freak accident involving hair spray, a misplaced skateboard, a steep
    hill, lake and downed power lines...

    last two election results. All the smart people are along the coasts.

  body: "It's easier to blame the puppet. The political misdirection of the people,
    we're distracted by the seeming ignorance of the dancing clown while the real
    \"powers that be\" are pulling the wool over our eyes. All the news stations are
    on \"Terror watch\" scaring all the confused and ingorant trying to make us even
    more paranoid than we already were.\r\n\r\nI'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything,
    but I do have a weird feeling that things in America aren't going to be the same.
    Big Brother lost some of their power over the people ever since the end of the
    Cold War and their trying to get it back. Terror keeps people in line, compliant.
    If you think your freedom could be taken, it's going to shake you up, either you'll
    fight for it or ask someone to do it for you. The governments betting on the latter.\r\n\r\nIn
    about 2 years, everyone will be scared s4!tless and that's when the next \"presidential
    hopeful\" will come in and show that Bush was a baddie and we don't have to put
    up with feeling scared anymore. ~ just how the government planned it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Okay
    rereading that just gave me weirdo chills.) "
