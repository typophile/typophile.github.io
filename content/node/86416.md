    find the easiest thing to do is sketch it on paper and then redraw it on screen.
    But if you cannot draw\u2026\r\n\r\nDraw an ellipse, slightly higher than the
    center of the caps height, resting on the baseline. Copy/paste it, move the copy
    so that the top abuts the cap height. Chop each on in half, deleting the unnecessary
    side, and join then at the center of the s. Paste O in the background/mask and
    align the top and bottom of your s shape with the horizontal center of the horizontal
    of the O stoke. Now adjust the spine of the S so that it works without a point
    in the center. Stroke the S curve (make sure to leave the original around for
    when you want to start over), adjust weights where and as needed, and start tweaking."
