  to try to make a my first calligraphic font. Honestly, I think about myself as a
  poor calligrapher with basic knowledge learned during studies, actually my last
  contact with calligraphy was in Calligraphy class, a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\nI
  made only a couple of letters (uppercase), and I was thinking if anyone could give
  me some constructive comments, am I on right direction, does this seems interesting
  to you etc...\r\n\r\nI made quicky version with \"serif\", take it as an attemption.
  :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WindWagon_5650.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks"

    do like that B. The D shape is also interesting to my eye. \r\n\r\nDefinitely
    worth experimenting with, in my opinion."
