  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Chris (Dezcom) suggested I try this here&hellip; (before anyone gets upset about me re-posting an earlier question from elsewhere)</p>
<p>Does Arial Unicode have the wrong characters in Unicode positions 015E and 015F? These are supposed to be &ldquo;Latin Upper- and Lowercase S with Cedilla&rdquo;, but Arial Unicode seems to have &ldquo;Latin Upper- and Lowercase S with Comma Below&rdquo; (which should instead be at 0218 and 0219)&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah, I was pretty sure the general subject had come up before. Fascinating as that debate was (and introducing the concept of the &lsquo;detached cedilla&rsquo; with which I was not familiar), it drifted into historical manuscripts at the end. The fact remains that the whatever-it-is under the S/s in Arial Unicode&rsquo;s 015E and 015F (which are supposed to be s-cedilla) strongly resembles Arial&rsquo;s (and for that matter, Helvetica&rsquo;s!) comma, and doesn&rsquo;t at all resemble Arial&rsquo;s cedilla.</p>
<p>But then Arial Unicode doesn&rsquo;t have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at all in places (0218 and 0219) for the (Romanian) s-commaaccent, even though they&rsquo;ve already designed what, to all intents and purposes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> an s-commaaccent.</p>
<p>Argh!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Arial Unicode MS has further design errors. The double-width diacritics are positioned incorrectly, meaning that a correctly encoded string with a diacritic mark that is supposed to go over or under two characters will display with the diacritic mark shifted one letter-width to the left.</p>
<p>One can also point to numerous design flaws in the non-Latin components that render the font unusable for serious typography in those scripts, but the s-cedilla/comma issue and the double-width diacritic issue are egregious outright errors. I had the impression Arial Unicode MS is basically abandonware now, with no plans to correct these errors or update the font at all.</p>
<p>This is probably all for the best. It&rsquo;s better to extend Arial&rsquo;s character coverage gradually in careful, thought-out steps than to try to fix something that is fundamentally broken, namely Arial Unicode MS. Rather than duplicating Arial Unicode MS&rsquo;s approach of including everything from Arabic to Chinese in a single font, the current approach seems to be developing a suite of Arial-compatible non-Latin fonts each having Arial glyphs for Latin coverage. This makes more sense. The logical strategy would be to at least match the character coverage of Arial Unicode MS through the extended Arial and its family of compatible non-Latin fonts, so that we can leave the Frankenstein that is Arial Unicode MS behind. Just how realistic it is to expect all those Arial Unicode MS fonts on all those computers to be replaced with a new and improved Arial-led family of fonts remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I admit I don&rsquo;t know much about this situation, so please do come correct me if you know more about this.</p>

<p>Seems fixed in this Arial (5.06, 2008), for U+035D (double breve), U+035E (double macron), and U+035F (double macron below). Although for no apparent reason, the double macron hops up and down when switching between regular, bold, italics and b+i.</p>

<p>According to Microsoft, Arial 5.05 supports the following Unicode ranges:
Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, IPA Extensions, Spacing Modifier Letters, Combining Diacritical Marks, Greek and Coptic, Cyrillic, Cyrillic Supplementary, Hebrew, Arabic, Latin Extended Additional, Greek Extended, General Punctuation, Superscripts And Subscripts, Currency Symbols, Mathematical Operators, Supplemental Mathematical Operators, Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A, Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B, Box Drawing, Block Elements, Geometric Shapes, Miscellaneous Symbols, Alphabetic Presentation Forms, Arabic Presentation Forms-A, Combining Half Marks, Arabic Presentation Forms-B</p>
<p>Times New Roman 5.01 supports the same ranges except IPA Extensions and Currency Symbols, and one imagines these will be added in the future.</p>
<p>Arial and Times New Roman are still being updated, as opposed to Arial Unicode MS. It seems Arial&rsquo;s character extensions are a ‘reboot’ so they have nothing to do with the errors in Arial Unicode MS.</p>
<p>I think for practical reasons it is a bad idea to add Chinese characters (or hangul, for that matter) to what is primarily a font for Latin and other metrically compatible scripts. I think even Arabic is pushing it.</p>

<p>Their own documentation is lagging behind :-)</p>
<p>The TNR I have is 5.05, and it indeed comes with a nice complement of Phonetics: U+0180 up to U+036F, plus U+1D00 to U+1DFF &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t check but it seems to be virtually complete. It also has a vast range of tone markers &ndash; enough to typeset a Bizet aria with.</p>
<p>Currency-wise I&rsquo;m not that educated; I&rsquo;m seeing stuff like Drachma, Austral, Hryvnia, and Cedi for the first time.</p>
