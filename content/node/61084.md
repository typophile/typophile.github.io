body: "Thanks in advance for any thumbs up/down, advice, pointers, or thoughts.\r\n\r\nI'm
  making a logo for \"cauzwear,\" a line of accessories that support some pre-chosen
  causes. We've all seen the \"cause ribbons\" (breast cancer... everyone knows that
  pink ribbon; lymphoma... lime green ribbon; AIDS/heart health is red, and so on)
  but the client's idea is to take that ribbon to another level of wear-ability. Half
  of the profit will be donated back to the causes (which are set to expand into more
  causes, based on the success of the initial line).\r\n\r\nThe logo should indicate
  seriousness balanced with movement, spirit and vitality.\r\n\r\nThe colors you see
  in this image are part of the branding palette, but the final logo color combo is
  TBD.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nCR\r\n\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\n\r\n\r\nJust
  what I was hoping to hear. I always learn so much from this place, so thank you.\r\n\r\nThis
  round I tried to consider what I wanted to accomplish, not what I wanted to \"look\"
  like. I think this is more nuanced, than the last version, though still subtle.
  \r\n\r\nOnce again, thank you for any thoughts you may have. \r\n\r\nCR"

  body: "Catherine, the transition from z to W doesn't feel right. Also, I'm always
    suspicious when a client asks for the \"serious but fun at the same time\" sort
    of thing and I fear you might have taken it too literally by combining those 2
    fonts. On one side you have optima (why did you choose it? What does it say to
    you and what is optima all about anyway?) and on the other some script which does
    evoke movement but in a too obvious way. Surely there must be a more criative
    way to combine 2 \"contrasting\" fonts (if that's what you want) and evoke a certain
    dynamism? \r\nI also think it could be more compact and more \"intense\". Maybe
    you're being too shy, it feels like you're a bit insecure and consequently the
    logo lacks the necessary boldness. But look: this is only my modest opinion. This
    is just a suggestion to experiment more and go a bit more c-c-c-c-craaaaaaaaaaaaaazy.
    Good luck.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I see that you were using the ribbon in the 'w' of wear..but maybe you could
    use one font. and maybe play with a simple ribbon as the 'a' in cauz...

    didn't realize that updating the post wouldn't make it register as \"new.\" :]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Ah! It's a good idea to preserve the original ribbon which is already so
    well established.\r\nAlso I think it's clever to use it instead of the \"A\".
    I didn't like that little black and white element. Any meaning or is it only decorative?
    I think the ribbon alone + text should be fine. The font feels fragile, I personally
    would go for something more solid and consistent. If you manage to combine than
    in a creative way, you're done. There are so many logos out there, make yours
    memorable.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Is there a reason why it's \"Cauz Wear\" and not \"Cause Wear\"? Are they
    just trying to be cool? If so, I'd say it's too much like a dad tryin' to be hip,
    homeslice.\r\n\r\nAlso agree with the comments about it being too fragile. Come
    up with a solid ribbon mark, and then solid type to support it. I don't think
    your efforts to combine the mark with the type are working well.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Lore: The b/w element (a polka-dotted button thingy) has just been chosen
    as the branding piece for the entire line. Much like the Lacoste alligator that's
    on every shirt, sock, tie, legwarmer (truth, they made them in the 80s, I still
    own mine), perfume, bag... The little b/w button will be on the clasp of every
    necklace, on the card that displays every pair of earrings, and eventually on
    the clothing line as a small accent. So, this is a non-negotiable portion of the
    logo; I just tried to incorporate it in a way that wasn't overwhelming.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that the font is a little too wispy. I'll play around with some weights
    tonight.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, who put the \"z\" in \"cauz\"? I don't know, but
    it's not negotiable at this point, unfortunately. The standard spelling was too
    close to a pre-existing initiative, so they went with the \"z.\"\r\n\r\nThanks
    again. Can't wait to try out your ideas later on."

    the first post? It really makes the thread confusing and nonsensical. I can't
    figure out which posts are referring to which images if all the images are on
    top and/or replaced randomly by the OP. \r\n\r\nModerators:  \r\nI'd like to suggest
    a time limit on editing the original topic posts. These threads are becoming too
    confusing to bother reading! If I reply to a new topic, it's weird for the OP
    to modify to topic I replied to therefore rendering my comment mute (and I can't
    delete it, because it's just a comment.) Just a thought."

    me aaaaalllllllll excited about "two new posts," when they aren't remotely related
    to this thing I'm making, but instead about misplaced frustration pertaining to
    forum protocol. Sheesh.

    the letter A distracting. I keep reading CUZ WEAR. \r\n\r\nIf Cauz Wear's mark
    is the polka dot button then go with that. Incorporating a differently drawn pink
    ribbon (for example) may lead people to think it is a scam of some sort since
    the \"real\" Breast Cancer mark isn't being used. If it is a legitimate partnership,
    those brands will probably want their mark shown (especially the more established
    organizations) and not bastardized into combination of the two designs."
