body: "I'm having difficulty with adding an image to the background layer. I can create
  the image no problem with g.Rasterize(imagexyz), but I don't see anything about
  adding it to the glyph again.\r\n\r\nI'm doing some stuff with PIL, but I can't
  even get that far until I can add the image to the glyph to trace it.\r\n\r\nTrace(imagexyz)
  does not work. It appears there is a bug with Trace.\r\n\r\nrelevant documentation:\r\nhttp://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/html/Image.xml.html\r\nhttp://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/xml/Glyph.xml\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated."

  body: "Yeah, so this works, but the traced image gets put at (0,0)\r\n\r\nI thought
    about adding a pixel to fix the sidebearings, but glyphs with descenders get put
    in at 0,0 as well. Any ideas on how to fix this?\r\n\r\nManually tracing a background
    image works fine and inserts the trace results exactly where they should go."
