body: Let's say you had an idea to develop a typeface that was based on the logotype
  of a professional sports team. What is the legal protocol for this? Would I need
  to contact to the team before I embarked on the design?

    So long as you don't include a replica of their logo in your font. (but I ain't
    no lawyer)\r\n\r\nThis may shed some light on the legalities.\r\nhttp://www.atypi.org/10_Visitors/30_typeface_protection/feinberg_html"

  body: That's what I was thinking... The scenario I imagined though is that I would
    create this typeface, approach the team and say, "Hey, I've got this typeface
    here for sale, that you could use in your marketing materials etc." My worry is
    that they would come back and say, "We're not buying that, because it is ours
    to begin with!" Or something threatening along those lines. I wonder what the
    likelihood of that is?
