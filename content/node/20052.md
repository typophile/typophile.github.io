  5 seems to be ignoring my kerning classes and the values in\r\nmy (metrics) kerning
  mode window and using the basic metric set for kerning etc. \r\nWhen I quicktest
  the typeface within FL it uses the kerning settings, but not when exported!?\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone encountered this problem before? I thought it might be an exporting preference

      ...I have now ammended. When I exported the typeface in .ttf format, the pairs
      which now have posititve values were kerned just as I had set in FL. hurray!!
      -31 was for lwr case 'av' kerning pair. \r\n\r\nDoes this mean that negatively
      kerned pairs will not export within the typeface? or Is it a matter of balancing
      the 'set' width of characters within the 'metrics mode',  with kerning data
      in 'kerning mode' to achieve negative kerning? How would you negative kern?\r\n\r\nIn
      my 'Opentype panel' the kerning feature is there and all my pairs are also.
      \ Negative and positive, alot of negatives as I have said. I presume this was
      my problem? \r\n\r\nWhat would be your advise for setting width in metric mode?
      For example would you just set metrics to character width, left and right and
      leave all spacing between characters to kerning mode?\r\n\r\nA million questions,

  body: "It should not matter if kerning values are positive or negative. If they
    are in the kern feature, they should go into the font and be recognized by Adobe
    apps.\r\n(If you make PS-flavored OTFs, in \"Options/Preferences\"--\"Generating
    OpenType & TrueType\"--\"Kerning\", you should only mark \"Generate OpenType kern
    feature &c\". In the first section \"Generating OpenType & TrueType\", bottom
    part, \"Export OpenType Layout tables\", \"Compare feature definitions\" and \"Generate
    GDEF table\" should be on.)\r\n\r\nUsing classes may help you keep the number
    of kerning pairs smaller. In the middle of <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18452\">this
    thread</a>, there was a bit more about kerning and classes.\r\n\r\nHow do you
    space/kern your font? Normally, letterspacing should be done in metric mode entirely,
    by adjusting the spaces to the left and right side of each glyph. (This is still
    the old metal type model.) And only if this resulted in good letterspacing, then
    you switch to kerning mode and refine individual critical pairs, say, VA AV &c.
    But this should be the very last step, and not affect too many pairs (at least
    in theory), if you don't want to get crazy!&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "I am customizing Garamond Premier Pro for a customer by adding several new
    glyphs (mostly underdot characters) using FL 502. There have been several issues
    with the kerning and small caps feature in the custom font.\r\n\r\nMy export settings
    are good according to earlier items in this thread.\r\nThe program will generate
    an OTF-ps font with the additional glyphs, but it retains only it's original OpenType
    tables and features.\r\n\r\nMy 1st concern is working through the kerning issues.\r\nI
    have several problems with it working as it should.\r\n\r\nI have assigned the
    new glyphs to FL's kerning classes (e.g. the cap underdot T is in the same kerning
    class as cap T with cap T being the parent or key glyph of the kerning class).\r\nWhen
    I enter the metrics window the kerning pair values are visible in the kerning
    fields for the original glyphs (cap T and lower case a for instance) but not for
    the new glyphs until I actually click into or activate the kerning field.\r\nHave
    others seen this behavior?\r\n\r\nFontLab support has been reasonably responsive
    and advised me to subtable the kerning feature (a very tedious process in a font
    with 10,000 plus kerning pairs?). My most recent query to them said:\r\n\"I am
    having issues with subtabling the kerning feature\"\r\nTheir response was:\r\nThis
    is a known problem with no easy fix. It's a problem (flaw in design) of the OpenType
    font format.\r\nDo others concur with this statement?\r\n\r\nIf I try to recompile
    the OT Tables after updating the kerning feature I get an error like: [FATAL]
    <GaramondPremrDok> GPOS feature 'kern' causes overflow of offset to a subtable
    (0x2c226). \r\nEach time I manually add a new subtable to the kern feature (by
    keying in \"subtable;\" between 2 lines in the FL's OpenType panel) the subtable
    number in the error changes.\r\n(And again, the new glyphs are not part of the
    updated kerning tables unless I have manually activated them in the Metrics window.)\r\n\r\nCan
    someone offer me some guidelines to subtabling? other than Adobe's and Microsoft's
    suggestions to \"divide the class in half with a subtable command\" until it compiles
    succesfully."

  body: "> <em>Do others concur with this statement?</em>\r\n\r\nYes. Each GPOS table
    has to be below 64K, otherwise you get that overflow error.\r\n\r\nEvery time
    you use \u201Csubtable;\u201D you're creating a new GPOS table. The downside effect
    of creating a new table is that classes that are only present in one of the tables,
    can't be kerned with classes in other tables.\r\n\r\nWhat you could try to do
    is to <em>save table space</em>. This can be achieved by decomposing any class-class
    entries into single pairs <code>pos</code>, when both classes are constituted
    by only one character/glyph. Example: Lets say you have the following classes\r\n\r\n<code>_x_left:
    x'\r\n_q_right: q'</code>\r\n\r\nand that you kerned 'x' with 'q' by '-10'. When
    you hit \"Update [kern] feature\", FontLab will generate the following entry\r\n\r\n<code>pos
    @_x_left @_q_right -10;</code>\r\n\r\nSince this is expressed as class-class,
    it is starting to eat up some of the \"precious\" 64K without being really necessary,
    since you can express that pair simply as\r\n\r\n<code>pos x q -10;</code>\r\n\r\nand
    place it at the top of the <code>kern</code> feature, before class-class entries.\r\nUnfortunately,
    FontLab won't do this for you, so you either have to do it by-hand, or write a
    smart Python macro.\r\n\r\nBTW, the original Garamond Premier Pro <code>kern</code>
    feature only makes use of <code>subtable;</code> twice. This avoids table overflow,
    and puts classes from different scripts in separated tables.\r\n\r\n[Edit: Some
