  body: "<em>Perhaps for the first time, we can see the changes as they happen, and
    advance into them or retreat from them with an understanding of what is taking
    place.</em>\r\n\r\nTherein lies the problem: seeing is not necessarily understanding.
    Thomas Starr King once observed that the difference between a wise man and an
    ignorant one is that, while the latter only sees what is happening, the former
    understands what is happening. In other words, information doesn\u2019t always
    translate into knowledge, much less wisdom."

  body: "Ok, I'm reading it, it's not a joke, but I clicked the back button 'cause
    you're just the man I wanted to speak to.\r\n\r\nIs there any research to your
    knowledge which focuses on vertical space and readability? \r\nBy vertical spacing
    I mean gaps. I mean all the variations in \"whitespace\" used in a running column
    of text.\r\nYes, \"leading\" - and it's HTML equivalent \"line-height\" - would
    qualify but also things like the distance between sections of text - like the
    distance between a heading and the last paragraph of the previous section. And
    the space between the heading and the first paragraph - that kind of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, if you <em>see</em> what is happening, then at least it is <em>possible</em>
    for you to understand it. If, on the other hand, the changes come as a surprise
    that cannot be anticipated, then they cannot be understood before they happen.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I would criticize this position for being overly sanguine for an entirely different
    reason. If reading on display screens is \"bad\", and reading from paper is \"good\",
    making use of our understanding of this fact requires that we have a <em>choice</em>.\r\n\r\nThus,
    instead of noting the fallibility of human understanding, I would be more inclined
    to point out that we're running out of trees. (I suppose, though, that could be
    rebutted on the basis that if laser printers are \"good enough\", then so would
    be retina displays and e-ink and so on, as long as our \"understanding\" made
    us realize they were necessary for our brains to process type properly.)\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Reading the article, though, I see it's about content-related positives of the
    digital era, rather than typography-related negatives."

  body: "The reading-age of inaugural presidential addresses (USA) has been progressively
    lowering since Lincoln. This trend is caused by the advance of technology, but
    not in a direct manner.\r\n\r\nOne would assume that longer sentences with more
    complex construction provide a more subtle and profound expression, communication
    and understanding of ideas.\r\n\r\nBut the hyperlinked hive mind, immanent in
    digital social media, with its wisdom of crowds, is a horse of a different color."

    prompting the question is newefangled web design I'm seeing lately that has, to
    my eye, huge gaps between sections, and/or headings and sections, and it effects
    the flow of reading because it throws relatedness into doubt.\r\n\r\nI mean, if
    you picked up a newspaper and there was a three inch gap below a headline before
    the body copy began, you'd think WTF? You'd assume it was some kind of missprint,
    a typo.  You might even have to look back up at the headline to refresh yourself
    and get your bearings back.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
