body: I teach a History of Visual Communication and Design class at a community college.
  I have struck out finding any decent videos or dvds pertaining to design. I have
  found Duchamp, Mondrian, man Ray vids but I am looking for more relevant 20th C
  designers and design movements. I would love to find anything on Constructivism,
  de Stijl, Bauhaus, Modernism, Swiss school. Anybody have anything you could point
  me to?

    its more about his person, about his drawings and his affinity to nature, his
    philosophy, etc.. and if you know his books (not sure if they were translated
    to english..) you know everything thats being told. but still a nice thing to
    see. http://www.artfilm.ch/adrianfrutiger.php?lang=e&id=adrianfrutiger&suche=dvds\r\n\r\nthe
    site says that english subtitles are on the dvd"

  body: "Hillman Curtis has produced some excellent short films/videos on various
    designers called, appropriately enough, The Designer Series. I don't know if they
    are available on DVD or not though. It would be nice if they were. I really enjoyed
    watching all of them, and they include some very well known designers - Sagmeister,
    Carson, Pentagram (Scher, Beirut), etc. You can watch them at:\r\nhttp://www.hillmancurtis.com/hc_web/film_video.shtml"
