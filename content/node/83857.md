  the intel you've given me!  \r\n\r\nMy first post.....I have a nightclub/restaurant
  named The Grotto and looking for a font that has a stone-like feel.  The interior
  will have weeping water walls, other water features and have a cave-like feel.  I
  need a logo that channels this.  Suggestions?\r\n\r\nfishetti"

    cartoony. You might get a more sophisticated result with a logo that looks like
    stone with your name carved into the stone with a more conventional font.

  body: A font alone, and especially a novelty font, just won't cut it for good branding.  You
    should consider finding a designer whose work and style fits the vision you have
    for the brand.  This sounds like an awesome establishment, well worth the investment
    in a solid branding scheme.
