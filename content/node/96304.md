  body: "it must be <strong>Bronzo</strong> (or <strong>UltraBronzo</strong>) by Rick
    Valicenti (<strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Thirstype/|ThirstType]]</strong>,

    probably due to the print process.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n"
