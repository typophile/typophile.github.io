body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of designing a logo for a client.\r\nI've
  spent hours (actually days) trying to design my own letter system, but that seems
  to be taking too long. This is to be used for commericial pruposes, so ideally I'd
  be designing each letter from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis is my first job for a large client
  so I'm taking this seriously. I want to make sure I'm doing it right.\r\nI found
  a gorgeous font that is so well suited for the logo. I've been manipulating the
  letters to personalize it for the company.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether I can actually
  do this.\r\nWhat are the laws pertaining to font manipulation? Is there a percentage
  that needs to be altered?\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows a little bit about this, I'd greatly
  appreciate your advice.\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n"

  body: What is the font? Can't really answer your question without knowing the font.
    All foundries have different EULAs.

  body: Most logos are conceived from manipulated fonts and there isn't any restriction
    on the altering or usage. Once you puchase a font for repoduction you have the
    rights to create any shape or form from it. An example is the horizontal or vertical
    modification that is allowed in page making or graphic programs.

  body: Most EULAs allow (or at least don't disallow) the creation of logotypes as
    static images or even static outlines. What most (but not all) EULAs don't allow
    is the creation of a derivative font. I think we all assume or at least hope that
    you're considering the former option. No one at AT&T types A, T, &, T, death star
    to form the logo, they place an eps, bitmap, or use a logofont where the complete
    lockup is assigned to one key.

  body: "\r\nI won't be releasing a new font.\r\nI'll only be altering the letters
    for the logo.\r\nThis happened to be a really well-designed Free font I found.
    I didn't purchase it.\r\nI just went to the designer's website, where he has his
    free fonts posted. The download included only the font, no legal info attached.
    \ This font is posted on a few font sites, but there is no additional info. Only
    \"download here\" under the font name.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help.\r\n"

  body: "I wonder if the source of the font might make things more tricky. My advice
    related to commercial fonts. In your case there could be issues. Is the font legitimate
    freeware, did the guy who posted it make it, is there a type designer lurking
    somewhere with a freaky license that prohibits commercial exploitation?\r\n\r\n"

    able to say for sure. Otherwise you are swimming in vaguely warm waters.

  body: "it turns out this font did have a Read Me file attached, (just not posted
    on the source I originally got it from). So the Read Me says that I may use the
    Typeface for every kind of publication.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm safe then.\r\n\r\nsii
    -- I'm not sure I understand what you mean by \"derivitive font\"- I would like
    to alter existing letters from a font.  I definitely don't plan on creating a
    new font derived from the original... only 10 letters (eesh, what a loooong logo!!!
    that's a whole other concern for another forum!)\r\n\r\n"
