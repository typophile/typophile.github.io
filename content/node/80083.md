  'aalt' feature and simply generates its own code for this. There are some features
  which I would like to exclude from 'aalt' but which FLS seems determined to add
  back in. Is there some preference that I am missing in FLS, or is there simply no
  way to control the 'aalt' feature from within FontLab?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Have you verified this e.g. with TTX, OTM, or another tool?\r\n\r\nI could
    be wrong, but vaguely remember that 'aalt' is exported correctly when generating
    OTFs/TTFs with FLS5, but FLS5 creates a new aalt when importing OTFs/TTFs. So
    that what you see after importing to FLS5 is not what FLS5 exported ... (Curious
    for results of your check.)"

  body: "Thanks for your response, Karsten.\r\n\r\nMy original suspicion was due to
    opening the generated font files in FontLab.\r\n\r\nI've now tried opening them
    in both ttx and OTM, and in neither of these can I find *any* evidence of an 'aalt'
    feature at all, though I admit that I'm not very comfortable with interpreting
    the output of either of these tools.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\nUPDATE: While I can't
    find my 'aalt' feature in either ttx or OTM Lite, I am getting little triangles
    showing up in InDesign's glyph palette, and they seem to be what I'd expect from
    my aalt feature rather than the one FLS5 is displaying, so it appears that your
    assessment was correct."

    subtables referenced by lookups referenced by 'aalt' have the expected content."

  body: "Karsten (<em>Vielen Dank!</em>) was able to determine that my 'aalt' feature
    was indeed not being generated and that the problem was with my code rather than
    with FontLab Studio.\r\n\r\nNow I have a followup question:\r\n\r\nHow many users
    would be terribly annoyed by a font which lacked an 'aalt' feature altogether?\r\n\r\nI
    ask this because the face I'm working on has a rather large glyph complement and
    some fairly complex code. I've spent a lot of time trying to optimize the code
    because earlier versions were getting coverage offset overflow errors when compiling.
    I'd finally managed to pare things down so that it would compile, but that was
    while I was under the mistaken impression that my 'aalt' feature was in fact being
    generated. Once I restore it,  the GSUB table again becomes too large.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, 'aalt' seems less critical than the other features in the font, but I don't
    know what problems (if any) might result from omitting it.\r\n\r\nOpinions?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
