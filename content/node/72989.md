  body: "Dude, shouting won't get you anywhere. Chances are that people (like me)
    have tried to find a match for your request and have drawn a blank.\r\n\r\nThe
    closest I've got are the following freebies:\r\n\r\nStaubach by AbdulMakesFonts
    (http://www.fontspace.com/abdulmakesfonts/staubach); the centre bar on the E is
    a close match, but the S is wrong - the inside of the loops slope as they arrive
    at the serif. The K is incorrect also.\r\n\r\nAcademic M54 by justme54s (http://www.fontspace.com/justme54s/academic-m54);
    the weight is better on this one, but the center-bar of the E is too long, and
    while the top serif on the S is good, there is no bottom serif. The K is good.
    The point where the strokes meet on the 7 is cut at an angle, rather than vertical.\r\n\r\n-NJ"
