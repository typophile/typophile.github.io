    keep searching."

  body: Yeah, Palatino is close, but it's not there. This is driving me insane...I'm
    really good at fonts normally. Nobody at the unit the jet is attached to seems
    to know, but it just doesn't seem like it's an overly complex typeface....except
    it is!

    You won't get this out of a box because, in my opinion, a font probably does not
    exist in this form. It's probably a manually sloped and squooshed Frankenfont.
    I started with Albert Boton's 1996 design called Pompei  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/pompei/
    -- partly because of the similarity in _a_ --  sloped the letters 15 degrees right,
    cut a gap in _R_ and substituted the _Q_ tail from Baker Signet. Further editing
    could pretty well duplicate your image. BTW if this looks heavy, there is also
    a light weight version of Pompei.\r\nDon"

  body: That's a great idea! Every once in a while, I run across a font in one of
    these stencil plotters that doesn't have a commercial equivalent. I could draw
    the dadgummed thing by hand, I was just really not looking forward to it. I REALLY
    appreciate everyones help though...I really do!
