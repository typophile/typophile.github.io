  body: I thought so too, but it seems to be inverted and I can't find anything under
    that font to be similar.

    there is this version modified and renamed for the Jurassic Park movie?\r\n\r\nTop:
    Neuland (Regular, not Inline)\r\nBelow: Jurassic\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jurrasic_5113.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    I recall, there is yet another font something like it - named Africa!"

    Thank black is in site where the white is outside its like an inverted version
    of Neuland/Africa....\r\n\r\n"

    have not seen a legitimate font with this treatment of Koch's masterpiece. Nor
    have I come across a hacked version with it.\r\nEasy to make. Purchase an inline
    font that permits editing, use the parallel lines feature of a font editor and
    some minor tinkering, and voila you have it. Don't know if this one permits editing,
    but it's a fair inline version: \r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/179888/NewtonInline-product.html\"

      with Neuland Inline, convert the font to paths, release the compound, fill the
      inline areas with green, make the rest of it white with a green stroke - Ta
      da!\r\n\r\nUnless of course it had to remain an editable typeface? Doh!"

  body: "Good question. If you have technical skills you can use a font editor --
    some are free and others are expensive -- but there is usually a long learning
    period. If you don't need it as a font, but just as letters you can use a program
    like illustrator. \r\nOr you can ask someone with the required skills and program
    to do it for you. \r\nDon"
