I have a client who needs two flash banners, one in English, and one in Hebrew. He sent me over both versions of the copy he wants, but the .txt file for the Hebrew text shows up as question marks.

Does anyone have any clue on how to turn on Hebrew fonts in Windows XP?

		<div class="commentbody">When a text file displays Hebrew as question marks, this means the text is not not recognized. 

The customer's program that saved the text file exported the Hebrew text data as Unicode encoding for Hebrew, but in a file format (i.e. .txt) that does not support Unicode.

The customer must resend the file to you in a different file format.

The customer must resend the file to you taking into consideration two factors:

1. The file format must support Unicode.

2. You have a program that can read the file or import it correctly.

.doc from MicroSoft is a very good file format to transfer Hebrew text, as most people have MicroSoft Word XP or later.
.doc files from MicroSoft Word XP or later support both Unicode encoding and Hebrew.

After you finally get the file, to create an animated gif or a .jpg with the Hebrew text, it must appear right-to-left. You can use Adobe PhotoShop ME (it must be a ME -Middle East- edition).

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think these credible options will work in your case, because the text file no longer contains the Hebrew text, but only the codesa for an exclamation mark. In other words, it's a useless file, no matter how hard you huff and puff.

I have been around Hebrew files to typeset, and have run into every imaginable problem.

The latest problem of the exclamation marks is related to the solution: Unicode, which assigns a code value to every letter, symbol, or glyph belonging to most every language of the world.

However, transfer of data by one userto another, when each user uses a different software program poses a small challenge. Unfortunately, one user chooses a file format that doesn't support Unicode, and the resulting file only contains exclamation marks.

This is like any good invention. Instead of trying to repair the results, it is wiser and best to simply start over again from before the error happenned.</div>

That does help anwering the initial question, namely what to do when a text that does not want to display. I did not tell you but the text that may not want to display is http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/morfix.txt. It is a text file. As soon as you can manage to display its content, you can usually copy and paste as you did.

The problem is thus finding a first way to display. One way is to use <code>recode</code> and produce a utf-8 encoded replacement. Another way is to use TextEdit on the macintosh because TextEdit accepts ISO-8859-8 encoded text inputs (and can write utf-8 files). Another way is to add a few lines on top and bottom of morfix.txt to transform it into an html file, and specify that the charset is windows-1255. That is exactly how I produced the link morfix.html.

There may be other tricks to display. Of course, you could use yourself Notepad++ to transform the .txt file into the html file the way I did and then use some browser and finally copy/paste. It however seems that Notepad++ still cannot do what TextEdit does, i.e. do it directly. That is what I wanted to know. Thanks.

The browser is some kind of "work around".

All that is good on plain text, or some html documents. For me that's enough, since I almost exclusively typeset with LaTeX and LaTeX inputs are text files (and LaTeX can also handle various encodings). In fact, I need to recode only when colleagues tell me they can't use my files. For those professionals that require more sophisticated inputs I am afraid life may not be that easy.</div>

That does not look good indeed. My browser was being told that files are by default utf8 and the link cannot be read as utf8 text. Now I tell my browser to display the same link, but I tell my browser that the encoding is "Hebrew"...

Here is what I now get on my screen

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hebrew_5976.jpg]

That may not be perfect (the display on Chaim's editor shown above had no trouble with the final period and commas)  but at least the "question marks" are now replaced by Hebrew text. The link never contained question marks, it just contained information that my browser could not make sense of because it made no sense as a utf8 text.

PS If I click ISO-8859-8 the text displays in the wrong direction (Hebrew is written from left to right).</div>

It seems I'm wrong, for many years. Wow! How many clients had to resend their text files to me as .doc files. Hmmm.

This is like waking up each morning, going to work by getting the car and saying 'good morning' to your neighbor doing the same thing, and his onding back, 'have a nice day.'

'Such a nice guy,' you think.

You thought wrong, because ten years later he is arrested for being a serial rapist for ten years.

You think, 'boy, was I wrong 'bout him'.

:)

If that solved your problems, great!  I remember a time   when a doc file produced on a pc caused trouble on a mac because all those French accented letters are coded differently on the two platforms. For me (and many colleagues) receiving a doc file was no solution, it was a problem! With a .txt file, we could at least recode, thanks to that <a href="http://recode.progiciels-bpi.ca/"><strong>recode</strong></a> program written by <a href="http://pinard.progiciels-bpi.ca/index.html">François Pinard</a> who was for many years in my university (Université de Montréal) computing services. Today, many applications accept to read a wide choice of encodings. Times are changing.
