  it.\r\n\r\nI know there is some companies who offer that kind of services like this
  one: http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/Online_Publishing/index.shtml  but I wonder if
  I could buy a software to prepare myself that kind of file and place it on a server
  of my own?\r\n\r\nHelp would be greatly appreciate. Thanks"
