    some quick work in Photoshop you end up with the image below, which when submitted
    to WTF comes back with the perfect match.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dewitteraaf122_6640.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks Jeff. I found it with my [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Guide]]. I made the assumption that the lettering below the name was the same
    font, and that gave me the M and J to help narrow it down. (At the moment, my
    server seems down, hmmm.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks for providing the link to your 'Serif Guide'. It's been way too long
    since I've visited your site and that is an incredible resource that I didn't
    know existed.
