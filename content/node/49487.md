  body: "Charles, \r\n\r\nit is really difficult to offer any kind of constructive
    criticism without knowing some background behind the 3 logos.\r\n\r\nLacking this,
    one can really only comment on the technical aspects.\r\n\r\nHaving said that,
    all three logos seem to lack refinement in the curves. The top one needs work
    on the leg of the 'R', the symbol of the middle looks unbalanced and falls over
    to the left. Finally, the bottom 'R' looks clumsily extended without paying any
    attention to the stroke width.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
