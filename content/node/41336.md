  by [[Max Miedinger]]\r\n\r\nPublished by [[Adobe]] & [[Linotype]]\r\n\r\nThe basic
  design of Helvetica Rounded is the same as the design of the normal Helvetica fonts.
  The only difference is that the stroke endings of Helvetica Rounded are rounded
  rather than squared. The overall effect of this display type is more playful than
  its traditional relative. The original Helvetica design was created for the Haas
  Type foundry in Switzerland and further developed by the Stempel Type foundry and
  by Linotype. Based on earlier Grotesque designs, Helvetica brought a new level of
  mathematical accuracy to the sans serif genre. Helvetica\u2122 is a trademark of
  Linotype Corp. registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and may be registered
  in certain other jurisdictions in the name of Linotype Corp. or its licensee Linotype
  GmbH."
