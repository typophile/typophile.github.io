body: I've been banging my head on the wall trying to match up this font but to no
  avail. It has characteristics of verdana, gadget and myriad, but slightly different
  than all of them. Can anyone ID this font please? Your attention to my plight is
  greatly appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/docrequest_6724.gif]

    MyFonts. Sometimes it works like a dream, like this time.\r\n\r\nGlad to be of
    assistance, anyway!"

  body: Oh no, a cheater amongst our midst! Burn him at the stake! We would <em>never</em>
    use anything like Identifont; WhatTheFont; Rookledge's International Typefinder;
    Jaspert, Berry & Johnson's Encyclopaedia of Typefaces; other old type catalogues;
    FontBook; Indie Fonts 1, 2 nor 3... <em>Never!</em> :^D

    my end will be like Jeanne D'Arc's."
