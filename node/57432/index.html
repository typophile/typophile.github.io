This is the state of things, as I see them:

Arial Narrow => Horrible, ugly, ugly
Impact => Too black, too overused
Haettenschweiler => Only on Windows, see also Impact
Helvetica Neue => Only on Mac, how the heck do you specify it for anything other than Safari?
Tahoma => Tight fit, not really a condensed font. Just more condensed than Verdana.
Trebuchet => Tighter than Tahoma, still ugly

		<div class="commentbody">The really annoying thing is that fonts are often named differently across different platforms.  I couldn't tell you how many times I have had problems with Helvetica Neue and it not being recognized by photoshop because I had a differently named version of it from the creative director.  We finally standardized to the Opentype version, which has the same name everywhere (which might help solve your problem Dan), but while it went on, it was rather frustrating.

If you are willing to let go of some control, using font stacks would be a decently good idea.  It would allow you to specify which fonts you want to use on windows and macs.  It isn't an ideal solution (indeed @font-face would help resolve many an issue), but at least it is something that works now.  I'm using it on a site to identify Lucida Sans in its Windows version and Mac version (as they are named differently).  </div>

First, you said you couldn't wait for most browsers...at which point you don't have to limit your pick, so I assumed you meant the future, and second, you didn't say you want to <em>publish</em> anything or that you had a boss. ;) I'd start using Univers 59 on everything now, (as graphics), and then when the browsers catch up, you'll be stylistically prepared for da futcha.

Ok, REAL solution:

Pick out a really great condensed face that works well on screen.

Purchase a license.

Sneak into your boss's computer one evening and install it on his system.

Adjust your font-stacks as necessary.

Boss = happy!

Or, you know, uninstall IE6 from your boss's machine. Blame it on a virus or something. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, I am going through the same issue.
Linotype is currently offering a license extension for the use of Cufón, sIFR, Flash and EOT with @font-face. They do not permit using TTF or OTF with @font-face, as this would allow anyone to download and use the font.
Cufón transforms the font on a svg, and draws it with js. But the generator plus the font file in my case were more than 100ks, and the text can not be selected.
sIFR uses flash...
So I'm trying http://webfonts.fonts.com/  which is pretty cool, but isn't perfect either.
After trying all the condensed options they offer, I chose Trade Gothic Next Bold Condensed. Unfortunately, Chrome and Safari renders the fonts way smaller than Firefox and IE.</div>

So there is that, and the fact that any fall back fonts you define for @ff condensed heads, should they be employed, will blow-up your layout; I'd start using <em>as graphics</em> whatever font you plan on for condensed (actually most web designers are looking to quench a bold condensed thirst), and then... if the browsers catch up, you'll be stylistically prepared to start serving a live condensed. (None of this is recommended below 18-20 px or in large quantities, all of this is recommended for those with stylistic requirements beyond the current sizing and rendering barriers of CSS/OS type).

And in the mean time, I will see what I can do to give condensed and bold cond. families to everyone in the world for free, so sometime in the future, a fall back font won't blow up your layouts using condensed. If you want to change the Russian Doll inside this issue, lobby IE to support CSS: font-size-adjust.

The only remark now is that the lack of anti-alias on the text in some xp machines complicates the use of condensed fonts.
http://webfonts.fonts.com/ is a beta service and at some point they will begin to charge. But for those like me who need bold condensed into dynamic text, is the best option I found so far.
