body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI recently started selling fonts on the myfonts.com website and
  after a month the owner of the site asked me if I could change some values of the
  truetype versions of my fonts: \"...the TrueType versions of your fonts will need
  to be updated. For this the value of fsType in the OS/2 table needs to be set to
  4.\" \r\nI use Fontlab 5 and I searched for a spot/field where I could change these
  values, but I cant find them at all. I have no experience with these things so I
  would really appreciate someone telling me where I can make these changes. \r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\nJoe\r\n"

  body: "You can assign the fsType value via Python with the command\r\n<code>fl.font.ttinfo.os2_fs_type
    = X</code>\r\nwhere <code>X</code> can be one of the following integers:\r\n\r\n<code>0</code>
    : Everything is allowed (installable mode)\r\n<code>2</code> : Embedding of this
    font is not allowed\r\n<code>4</code> : Only printing and previewing of the document
    is allowed (read-only)\r\n<code>8</code> : Editing of the document is allowed\r\n\r\n(Wording
    as it appears on Fontlab v4.6 Mac, Font Info window, Embedding panel under Names
    and Copyright)\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I believe Adobe usually sets their fonts
    to \"Editing of the document is allowed\" so that you can make small changes in
    a PDF document, for example. [Edit: Not entirely true. Here's the correct <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html\">list</a>]"
