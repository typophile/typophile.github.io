body: "Hello\r\nI use Fontlab for create digital typefaces and when I want to test
  my font in metrics window I need to type every glyph name and in some scripts (like
  arabic) it's not easy.\r\nI need a utility to convert my text (it could be in a
  PDF) to glyph names of the font used in the text file. I did a comprehensive search
  and I couldn't find anything useful. is there anything out there that could do such
  a thing? or maybe convert text to Unicode values so I can convert them to glyph
  names?\r\n\r\nany suggestions are appreciated,\r\nThanks."

  body: You should be able to paste the text directly into the Metrics window in text
    mode. The text field at the bottom of the window will then show it with all the
    characters above Basic Latin converted into glyph names or Unicode numbers depending
    on what mode your Font window was in when you opened the Metrics window.

  body: "Hi Kevin,\r\nthanks for the reply,\r\nIt does work for Latin texts, but when
    I paste an Arabic text, it replaces the text with question marks, no matter which
    mode my font window was in. I use Mac osx, in windows it pastes a mangled text
    and no glyph shows up. I use fontlab 5.0.4 on mac. In Arabic situation is more
    complicated compared to latin, because when I copy the text, Os just copies the
    text without considering the initial or medial forms (they are rendered using
    OpentType features). so I think only way for me is converting text to unicode
    values or glyph names. or maybe there is something that I'm missing? did any glyph
    show up when you pasted an arabic text?"

  body: I needed to convert Cyrillic text to glyph names once, and ended up creating
    a Word macro to run through text and convert Unicode characters to glyph name
    strings.

    reads unicode value of characters? could I have the code?\r\nThanks"

  body: "I didn't need the Unicode values, since I was mapping to human-friendly glyph
    names, not uniXXXX format. So I just had a list of characters and my own corresponding
    glyph names.\r\n\r\nYou could use Word's ToggleCharacterCode function, which converts
    a character to its Unicode hex value or vice versa (manually, you can do this
    with alt+X after a character or code). So what you want a macro to do is to step
    through the text one character at a time and convert each character to its Unicode
    value preceded by 'uni'. I'm not a good enough programmer to figure out how to
    do this, but someone here probably is. Note also that you'll want to try to control
    the length of the Unicode hex, if that is possible, since Word by default does
    not include preceding 0s; so, for instance, converting 'A' to Unicode hex produces
    '41' not '0041'."
