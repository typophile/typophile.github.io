  comes in three different styles (1960, 1970 and 1980) and each has different weights,
  but instead of light, regular, bold they use Paris, London, New York.\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure there are a bunch of other typefaces that forego the typical weight labels.\r\n\r\nExamples
  would be appreciated!"

    have a design that I've been toying with that I was considering using Soprano,
    Alto, Tenor, Baritone, and Basso for the weight range. I don't know if this design
    will ever see the light of day. (No examples to show, sorry.) Plus, I doubt these
    designations would pass muster with a typical foundry, not if we wanted wide appeal.\r\n\r\n--
