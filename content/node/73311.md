  Vian\u2019s \u201CThe Dead All Have the Same Skin\u201D published by Tam Tam Books
  in 2007. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an image on Tam Tam\u2019s website: \r\nhttp://www.tamtambooks.com/vian_dead.html\r\n\r\nThe
  design work was done by Tom Recchion, but the book contains no information on the
  font used.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
