  have 2 questions hope you can help me with.\r\n\r\n1.about le corbusier's modular
  measures, how is it applied to typography? only for the grid? (maybe i can figure
  it out if someone gives me a link. although im fixing up my math intelligence which
  sucks right now) \r\n\r\n2.is the same modular applied on type sizes in a publication?
  how is it done? or again where i can learn about this? like having a certain proportional
  difference between all the hierarichal sizes in a publication?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
  a mill.\r\n\r\n"

    hmm i will try re stating the question?\r\n\r\nhow can we decide on the type font
    sizes within a publication? like i know i will have 4 different sizes from body
    to big title, does it matter that there is a proportional jump between them?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n"

  body: "I see no reason why Le Corbusier's Modulor could not be applied to a typographic
    scaling system. It is, is it not, related to the Golden ratio? I know it's more
    specific than that, but it might be best to consider your typographic system in
    isolation from factors like the height of the average man &c.... factors that
    might be irrelevant. \r\n\r\nFirst, find your ideal body size (which will be different
    for each typeface and application) you then find the equivalent sizes for your
    other faces, and multiply the results by some factor of the G.R.. \r\n\r\nFor
    example, I start at the point where your body type and, say, your companion sans
    are equal in x-height, and then work from there. In some cases they will be almost
    equal from the start (for example Matthew Carter's ITC Charter is almost exactly
    the same size and proportions as Process' Seravek), but some faces which otherwise
    share a similar set of proportions (for example OurType's Eva and Adobe Garamond
    Premier Pro in the caption size) will turn out, as I'm sure you know, to be perversely
    unequal in numerical value, eg 9.5 of font A = 8.9 of font B. \r\n\r\nSo let's
    say that your base body size is 9.5. For a simple table you'd go (NB I'm rounding):\r\n\r\n9.5
    x 1.618 = 15.4 \r\n15.4 x 1.618 = 24.9 \r\n24.9 x 1.618 = 40.2 \r\n40.2 x 1.618
    = 65.1 \r\n\r\nthis process can go the other way: \r\n\r\n9.5 / 1.618 = 5.8 \r\n5.8
    / 1.618 = 3.6 \r\n3.6 / 1.618 = 2.2 \r\n\r\nBut for editorial type these steps
    are way too big to be useful, so to pick another number that produces steps that
    are small enough, use the a root of your number. If I was to use a square root
    my values would cycle back to my original scale in only two steps:\r\n\r\n2 {root}
    1.618 = 1.272 \r\n\r\n9.5 x 1.272 = 12.1 \r\n12.1 x 1.272 = 15.4 \r\n15.4 x 1.272
    = 19.5 \r\n19.5 x 1.272 = 24.9 \r\n\r\nBut if you choose a root of a higher power,
    you can have more steps: \r\n\r\n4 {root} 1.618 = 1.1278 \r\n\r\ngives you four
    steps: \r\n\r\n9.5 x 1.1278 = 10.7 \r\n10.7 x 1.1278 = 12.1 \r\n12.1 x 1.1278
    = 13.6 \r\n13.6 x 1.1278 = 15.4 \r\n\r\nThere's a good calculator for this at:
    \r\n\r\nhttp://www.wiris.com/demo/en/ \r\n\r\nAnd you can use a number of different
    roots that fit together, so a 1 {root}, 2 {root}, and 3 {root} set would have
    a collective cycle that would be in unison in six steps (as the smallest common
    factor of 2 and 3 is 6).\r\n\r\nOnce you have your multiplier (say 1.1278) then
    you can build out your tables of type-size equivalents as far as you wish. You
    can, if you're doing a large number of values, plug it into an Excel spreadsheet
    (just create a chain of functions between cells).\r\n\r\nFor leading I think it's
    better to think of it like Lego bricks, so I just take my base value and divide
    it as needs be, eg:\r\n\r\n12/6 = 2 \r\n\r\n2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14 etc. \r\n\r\nYou
    might be able to employ more sophisticated math on your grid, but it might make
    things very complicated.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of some help."
