  body: This is not very well drawn. I would say it&#39;s probably custom lettering.
    Possibly based on Times Bold &#40;stretched&#41;. Hard to say for sure. I seem
    to recall a few fonts that have characters similar to some these, but it would
    take some time to find them. An R like that is pretty rare. I&#39;m not sure if
    I&#39;ve ever seen one quite like it.
