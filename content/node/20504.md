  a list (PDF or txt) of all the typefaces included in the current edition of the
  Adobe Font Folio. Does anybody know where to find it (before I start bugging Adobe
  customer support)?\r\n\r\nTHX"

    the most recent font collection, from its Adobe website.\r\n\r\nBut this file
    is still downloadable elsewhere on the Internet, e.g. here\r\n\r\n http://www.xchangefr.com/pdf/FFOTEFontList.pdf\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    my two own websites\r\n\r\n http://www.forgers.de\r\n http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/#adobe9\r\n\r\ndocument
    the entire Adobe font stuff - both old (PS) and new (OT).\r\n"

  body: And just for future reference, the Typography forum on Adobe.com has a sticky
    posting that lists all the fonts. You can see it at http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.1dea4840/87
