    Same company, same prices, better site.

    more advanced than FontFont.com. Same company, same prices, better site.\"\r\n\r\nFunctionality
    is in the eye of the user. FontFont.com works with my browser. FontShop.com does
    not. However, if you look for a non-FontFont font at FontFont, you are greeted
    with \"This font is not a FontFont, but you can find it at fontshop.com.\"\r\n\r\nWhat
    a tongue twister. Sort of like \"How many fonts could a FontShop font if a FontShop
    could font fonts.\" My apologies to the woodchuck."
