  I utilise these glyphs, it's best to confirm they're the same as those in the photo.
  \r\n\r\nIn Georgia, the matching glyphs appear to be \"\u03B1\", \"\u03B8\", then
  either \"\u03C3\" or \"\u0431\".\r\n\r\nThe rest\u2014other than the German double
  s and the << arrows\u2014aren't available in the glyphs panel it seems. \r\n\r\nCan
  anyone confirm?\r\n\r\nAppreciatively,\r\nLuca\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p52_4074.jpg]"

    most of these in standard Georgia. The Georgia Pro that Ascender & Font Bureau
    are working on will have them, however.\r\n\r\nThe double arrow is not quite two
    \u201Clessthan\u201Ds (&lt;&lt;), but rather a \u201Cmuch less-than\u201D (\u226A).
    And there\u2019s also a \u201Cgeometrically equal to\u201D (\u2251) in there.
    \r\n\r\n(Georgia Pro will not have these specialized math symbols.)"

  body: "There probably isn't one. Perhaps we can be of more help if you could say
    why you want Georgia. If it is for Georgia's screen performance, there have been
    many changes since Georgia was first created. Something else might be better.
    Screen display is not something I know much about.\r\n\r\nIf you just like Georgia,
    use it, and mix in the mathematical operators and even Greek symbols from another
    font. What we've always had to do -- well, at least since the 1500s.\r\n\r\nBear
    in mind the Greek symbols used in mathematics are usually slightly different than
    for the language. It wouldn't be so much *wrong* to use a Greek language font,
    but it would look odd.\r\n\r\nFor free OpenType math fonts, search for what TeX
    has to offer."
