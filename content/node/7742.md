  body: You mean folios that move up and down in relationship to the length of the
    text above, yes? So the folio is in a fixed relationship to the text block, rather
    than to the page. <BR> <BR>This can <i>look</i> nice, and avoids having the odd
    folio off by itself, but it is functionally, well, moronic. I would classify this
    practice as the tyranny of aesthetics over functionality, because although it
    looks nice it largely defeats the practical purpose of having folios in the first
    place. Let&#39;s say you have looked up a chapter or section heading in the table
    of contents, or have looked up a entry in the index, you then need to be able
    to find the relevant page. So you flip through the book to find the appropriate
    folio. Obviously this is very much easier if the folios are always in a fixed
    position relative to the page.

  body: If you&#39;re talking about what I think your talking about--I am slightly
    confused--I&#39;ve always seen this done with older texts &#40;older as in hundreds
    of years&#41; being redone. And I&#39;ve always held on to the belief that the
    folios were moved to correspond with how the original book&#39;s pages. <BR> <BR>That
    way no matter what version of the book you have, you can refer to page such and
    such, and everyone will go there. Kind of like the numerals beside each line of
    poetry or of a play. Does that make sense, or are we discussing something totally
    different?

  body: I assumed the question was about the physical position of the folios on the
    page, DeWitt, since David identified this as a design issue. What you are referring
    to, i.e. matching pagination of a previous edition, would be an editorial issue.

    to bouncing folios. <BR> <BR>Too often, the the result is a cocked spine if the
    folio is bounced from 216 picas or higher. <BR> <BR>Try to reason with your boss
    and hope he doesn&#39;t throw the book at you instead.

  body: Sorry for the confusion. <BR> <BR>The image presented is somewhat correct.
    In this case I was refering to trade fiction. When you spec a composition for
    a type compositor to set, you can request the use of bouncing folios. A folio
    bounces when a page is being adjusted for bad paragraph breaks. Usually bad breaks
    are adjusted by making a page one line longer or one line shorter. With bouncing
    folios on a short page the folio moves up with the bottom line of text, and vise
    versa on a long page. When flipping through the book you will notice the page
    numbers fluttering up and down with the last line of text on each page. I think
    this seems strange but my boss feels that this is the correct way to design a
    text page. She thinks that page numbers should stay the same distance away from
    the last line of type on all pages. I think the page numbers are there for a functional-navigational
    purpose so they should stay fixed in place. I think it&#39;s distracting to see
    a page number fluttering up and down when you are trying to  find a specific page.
    When you are only dealing with a minimum amount of elements it is to me a necessity
    to harmonize those elements.Bouncing folios are strange, simple as that.

  body: 'Here&#39;s an idea: <BR>When you have to adjust the bottom of the page, omit
    the page number entirely. <BR>Except maybe when both pages in the spread are like
    that, then hopefully they&#39;re going in the same direction &#40;both one up
    or one down&#41; and you can put both page numbers in. For spreads that have one
    short page and one long page, decide if you want it to be slightly ugly or microscopically&#42;
    dysfunctional. <BR> <BR>&#42; Because chances are quite low that the reader will
    choose to open up to that spread to regain his bearings, and is then forced to
    go one spread back or forth. In comparison, all readers <i>will</i> traverse that
    spread at one time, so maybe aesthetics becomes more important. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: John, that second graphic of yours with the moving page numbers just looks
    wacky. <BR> <BR>David, I make your sort of bouncing folios all the time. But I
    always move the last up up or down equally on both sides of a spread. Also, I
    usually give a generous bottom margin to my work, so the question of an extended
    bottom line interfering with a page number or other master item doesn&#39;t comes
    up.

  body: If the amount of bounce is never more than a line, then I think there is a
    better case to be made for bouncing folios. The &#39;flutter&#39; of the numbers
    up and down while you flip through the book may look a little odd, but it does
    not significantly impede their function. You can, as Hrant suggests, avoid the
    problem by putting the folios at the top of the page.

  body: It&#39;s a common practice to add or remove a line so that you take care of
    any widows or orphans. <BR> <BR>Is it too simple to ask why the folios must be
    on the bottom of the page? <BR> <BR>If you need the folios at all, then move them
    to the top or side. If on the bottom they must remain, I think you and your boss
    are both correct it&#39;s unlikely the average reader will notice the difference
    either way. And it certainly won&#39;t keep them from purchasing the book. <BR>
