  inside of the lettter N (and also on A, etc). I've created a rounded corner on all
  the 90 degree edges. What's the \"system\" for creating reproducable rounded corners?
  Do I just eye it? Or can I use a system so I can reproduce this consistently across
  letters?\r\n\r\nPeek at the \"E\" and \"L\", I'd like to be consistent with these
  letters...\r\n\r\nDesigning a face for a network...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n_issue_4060.png]"

  body: That was how I approached it the first time, but the curve feels too pointed
    to me. Maybe it's just the look I'm going for that's throwing me off?

    like a cross between din next and gotham rounded.

  body: "I would suggest you have a look at the way various rounded faces have done
    this, identify the principles (internal design vocabulary/logic/strategies) which
    they have used, and then go about implementing a strategy of your own.\r\n\r\n<em>we're
    actually trying to create a face that's a little like a cross between din next
    and gotham rounded.</em>\r\n\r\nThat doesn't sound like a very inspired brief.\r\nMaybe
    all you need do is just:\r\n1. Draw a monoline skeletal path.\r\n2. Apply \"Make
    Parallel Path...\" (This step provides a bit more control).\r\n3. Apply \"Expand
    Path...\"\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at what you've done so far, you appear to be
    a little out of your depth, in terms of your experience in type design, to be
    comparing your project with DIN and Gotham. I don't know who your client is and
    what their expectations are, and I wouldn't want to find fault with anyone for
    wanting to tackle a project themselves (it's the only way to learn), but this
    may not be the right time and place for that approach, and you may be better off
    to hire someone with more experience to do this.\r\n\r\nI would imagine your face
    will turn out like this novice design:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/50437\r\nIt's
    nice, but with a naive quality, and there are limitations to heavier weights,
    which require considerably more drawing/design skills."
