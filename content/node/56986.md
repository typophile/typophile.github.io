body: "So I'm currently looking to create a personal mark for placement on resume,
  website and possibly a business card. As much as I need this, I'm also looking to
  make this a good learning experience so please feel free to be blunt and honest.
  \r\n\r\nI've decided to show a variety of samples just to see if anyone sees any
  potential in a particular direction. The focus thus far is on my name and my initials
  'KM' as I don't particularly want to brand myself as a company, just as an individual.
  (Is there a danger in doing something as common as your initials?)\r\n\r\nAny and
  all feedback and comments are appreciated. Thank you in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kmlogos_3676.gif]\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like version 'A' but worry that the whole logo will disappear at small sizes.
    The size relationship of the type to the mark is also an issue for dynamic sizes.

  body: What about a variation on the first one where you use color instead of outlines
    to differentiate the k from the m? Something like two values of the same color?

    attached to it. Not sure if you want it and what it implies.

    Some very abstract.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kmlogos2_5181.gif]\r\n\r\n@dave,
    yeah you're probably right but I don't imagine that I'd use that symbol much smaller
    than it is in that image. As for the type, none of that is finalized, I just wanted
    to show placement.\r\n\r\n@graphicurious, I will definitely try that. I just want
    to make sure it works in 1 colour first."

  body: Actually B is quite good too I think. Purely from a visual balance and being
    easy to recognize perspective. The C is close, but merging M and N is one thing
    too much for the mark IMO. The V-I treatment is already distinctive enough.

    work well in many sizes, very strong, and I like that it emphasizes your distinctive

    there is potential in \"A\" if you play with the mark a bit more (fill colors).\r\n\r\n\"F\"
    is a great option, and I like the first one you posted in this thread, you've
    turned it from a scripty \"m\" into a spiral. A spiral can mean a lot for design.
    \"motion\" \"moving\" \"progress\" \"progress bar\" \"controlled creativity\",
    etc."

  body: "I think A is great. Although the M seems to glare out at you, and a K is
    recognizable as well--BUT there's nothing to tell us that it is in fact KM not
    KA. Anyone else see the italic A?\r\n\r\nF is gorgeous. I guess I don't see too
    many anagrams that are just one letter. I think its rather useful to have a mark
    recognizable from another orientation. I also get the read that these are waves--the
    creative flow."

  body: "@melo: Very nice. FWIW the mark has grown on me. It is simplistic, beautiful
    and it is memorable. A couple of things though that stick out in my opinion. One,
    the angle of mark doesn't match the angle of the italics. Two, second line is
    overpowering the top one. I think smaller type in the second line might work quite
    a bit better. I'd also consider setting both lines in italic or dropping the italics
    altogether.\r\n\r\n@bemerx25: [[http://www.hyperic.com/images/customers/mosso-logo.png|This
    one]] ? Even if they were not deprecating its use, it is pretty far from Kevin's
    version. As in \"impossible to mistake one for another\". Three vertical strokes
    at a slight angle is a very generic pattern, so it all comes down to the styling
    and decoration. And these are different between these two logos."

  body: Great results so far. However, you mentioned earlier that you did not want
    to brand yourself as a company, but in my opinion the copyright glyph seems to
    imply a sort of corporation attitude to the logo. You may want to consider revising
    that, otherwise all other aspects of the graphic are shaping up fine.

  body: Ouch, that sucks. I liked F as well. I also like B though. I think you should
    design a mark in the style of B and place the mark either above or to the left
    of the name. Maybe a typographical mark that knocks out of a distinctive shape
    in a creative way? Is that vague enough for ya?

  body: Yeah, the F version is so obvious that was bound to be done before. Solving
    the riddle in version A made me like it the most. I actually thought that they
    were ordered by preference at the beginning. In any case, if you added colors
    to A, it could be a pretty stunning logo.
