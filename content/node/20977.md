  dicussion</a>. For such an intelligent, software literate crowd their attitude toward
  piracy is 'blah' at best. \r\n\r\nHow the hell did the Black Art get to be like
  this? Surely typefaces & type designers had some respect once upon a time.\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

    for every person that properly licenses a typeface there are at least five who
    do not. :^(

  body: Part of the problem (I think) is the EULA's are so intricate and vary so widely.
    I certainly don't read them for every font I buy.

  body: I think piracy is so widespread and tolerated that it is almost culturally
    encouraged. I lurked in a Photoshop forum on MySpace and was not too surprised
    to see people get flamed when mentioning they actually paid for a legit copy of
    the program.
