body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI recently compiled a small collection of text morsels which
  resonated with me over the years. They are largely focused on design, art, philosophy
  and architecture.\r\n\r\nI used a modest grid to establish a versatile visual system
  complemented by a sparse aesthetic approach - I'm curious what you (my peers) think
  about the implementation of the UX along with your appetite for the subject matter
  I chose to run with.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\nhttp://inspire.boranikolic.com/\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBora"

    just plain static HTML?\r\n\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nMy latest favorite is \"In grid we trust\"

    with plans of wrapping it in Wordpress which will open the functionality to enable
    public contribution via the WP login/commenting system.\r\n\r\nP.S. Love the minimalism
    which governs your design"
