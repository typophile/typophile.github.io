body: 'I read somewhere recently that if Eric Gill had called Joanna &#34;Gill Serif&#34;
  instead he would have been the first to make a serif/sans family. I can&#39;t find
  it in Elements of Typographic Style, Anatomy of a Typeface, Letters of Credit, Counterpunch,
  or Paul Renner: The Art of Typography. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read any other
  type related books I&#39;ve read recently, &#40;other than R.R. Kelly&#39;s American
  Wood Type, but it&#39;s not in there. Is it?&#41; so where is it? I know this is
  a stretch, thinking that someone would kow the source right off the bat, but I also
  know that typophiles are a strange and mysterious bunch.  <BR> <BR> <BR>So, anyone...

    not the name that makes a family; Joanna <BR>and Gill Sans are largely unrelated
    designs, to me at least. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Who&#39;s going around spreading rumors about Eric Gill? This is killing me.
    If I read it in a book &#40;which I&#39;m pretty sure I did&#41;, who would have
    written it and not known about Clearface? Anyway, it&#39;s not all that important,
    I just couldn&#39;t remember. Thanks guys.

    <BR> <BR>Here is a partial quote from his article: &#34;Had Eric Gill planned
    Joanna and Gill Sans as one family he would have been the first in history to
    design a family of serif and sans, but he made them as separate designs with separate

  body: Bringhurst suggests Gill and Joanna together in Elements. You have to adjust
    the sizes to get the weights to match, and kern well.

  body: Gill Sans works well with Perpetua -- I used them for many years in a marketing
    newsletter. The range of the Gill Sans was very useful, especially the bold condensed,
    and even Ultra. Perpetua Titling was good for initials and, er, titles. I had
    to make a beefed-up &#34;small&#34; version of Perpetua for footnotes, though.

  body: I&#39;ve used them together as well. I always like to use the Ultra a a sort
    of small cap. I would extend it by 2%-3% and letterspace them.

  body: YES! Mark Foster RULES! <BR> <BR>I guess what this means is that I don&#39;t
    read enough actual books and read too much from the web.
