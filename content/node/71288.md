  for years without success.  Hopefully someone here has seen this font before and
  can help us out.  We're looking to ID the font used for the word \"unfiction\" (not
  the slogan underneath, that's the Calvin & Hobbes font).  The closest I could find
  was Gangly, but it's not an exact match.  Thanks in advance for any help you can
  offer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/40363_20060802234640_5637.png]"
