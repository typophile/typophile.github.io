    really great place! \r\n\r\nThe pronunciation of Koninklijke in English is quite
    a tough one. It sounds more or less like: Co-ning-kleh-keh. Have a great time
    there!\r\n\r\n---\r\nhttp://www.rubendelarivebox.com"

    yet, and the nederlands 'g' is hard to pronounce too (for me).\r\n\r\nGenerally
    I just say, the Royal Academy when I am talking about the school.\r\n\r\n"
