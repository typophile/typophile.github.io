    and Kaw Valley.&#41; <BR> <BR>But also, I might as well mention -- and this you
    <i>won&#39;t</i> find on MyFonts -- I prefer either &#34;Cheshire,&#34; &#34;Chesh,&#34;
    &#34;Cheshiredave,&#34; just not &#34;Dave.&#34; I shed that thing long ago. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m gone for the weekend tomorrow -- id some doozies while I&#39;m gone,

    individual performance that counts, it&#39;s just that we&#39;re a kick-a$$ scorching
    hot Type ID team. The competitive banter is just there to make sure we&#39;re
    not getting too full of ourselves and stay sharp. Jared was <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/4668.html?1043982273">
