body: I&#39;m working on a logo and am considering using a script with Nuetra Face.
  &#34;The Barge Lady&#34; would be set in Nuetra Face and following that would be
  &#34;Collections&#34; set in a complimentary script. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

  body: Nice pick, Hrant. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/coquette/"
    target="_blank">Coquette</a> is also an interesting choice as  <BR>the forms and
    x-height nearly match Neutraface. You might <BR>want something that contrasts,
    though.

  body: Wow, I think Coquette is much better. <BR>And you&#39;ve reminded me of Linoscript,
    although that would be a pretty extreme match-up. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
