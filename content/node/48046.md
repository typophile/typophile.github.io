body: I was wondering if anyone had a recommendation for a serif font to pair with
  Eurofurence- http://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=eurofurence (which ironically
  i did not know was connected to a furry conference in europe somehow).  I am designing
  a menu and had been using MrsEaves, but the client doesn't like that combo as she
  thinks that they are too contrasting.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a serif
  font, I looked at Century Gothic and Engravers Gothic, but there is a lot of text
  to fit, so most serif fonts tend to fit better.  Any suggestions on a simpler serif?
  thanks!

    the designer of <em>Eurofurence</em> but if I had to make a choice I know which
    typeface I would pick. What is the Menu for exactly...?"
