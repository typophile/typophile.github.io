body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nI'm in the middle of laying out a book for the first time;
  I know a small bit of InDesign and am fairly ok with character styles.\r\nWhat I'm
  not so clued up on is importing text from MS Word into InDesign. Here's my problem...\r\n\r\nI
  had effectively laid the entire book out, using text copied and pasted (not imported)
  from Word, and painstakingly manually\r\napplied character styles (italics where
  needed, superscript etc...). I realise now not the cleverest way to do it, but anyway,
  it's done.\r\nBUT \u2013 the client has now come out of nowhere with a rewrite of
  the text, and a fresh set of word files (no track and change and it's not an option
  for me to ask for this). \r\n\r\nWhat I want to find out is if, rather than me having
  to go through that whole slow, clunky process again, is there a way to link the
  current InDesign layout to the new Word files and somehow get it to update with
  all character styles intact? Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated,
  sorry in advance if this is a basic thing to ask!"

    you the orginal text was final and it wasn't, they're making you do unplanned
    work.

  body: Using the 'Get Text' function rather than copying and pasting should do this
    for you. If all the styles haven't been retained, just do an advanced search and
    replace procedure to apply them.

    > Place command. When you're asked to navigate to the file to place, be sure the
    \"Show Import Options\" checkbox at the bottom is checked. This will bring up
    the screen of import options shown below, and you can tell InDesign how to handle
    the Word file's style sheets. See InDesign's \"help\" files for more info about
    what the various options do.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-shot-1b_6115.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-shot-2b_5294.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

    100% different!). I occasionally find people resubmitting new manuscripts after
    the typesetters have started work on what was supposed to be the final version,
    and sometimes it turns out there's one new paragraph in the middle, and the odd
    word changed here & there, and that's it...\r\n\r\n(Worse is when you send 'em
    a PDF proof, and they export it back into Word, make changes, and send THAT back
    to you. <em>Noooooooo, you f***ers</em>!!)"

  body: "Thank you all for your replies. A combination of Place text and Thenius'
    script is semi-working, so somewhat helpful.\r\nI am finding it a bit unpredictable
    still \u2013 for whatever reason some text imports without any style applied,
    despite assigning a style\r\nin the import options, so I'm having to manually
    apply, which is slow. Is there a quick way to ask InDesign to identify X font
    and to apply Y character style to all instances?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that Word
    is such a clunky mess; trying to coincide styles is a struggle!\r\n\r\nThanks
    in advance."
