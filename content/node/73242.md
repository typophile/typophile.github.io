  I diligently measure and adjust these settings. How can I see them in action? Are
  these settings used by some applications for generating fractions? If so, how can
  I test them?"

  body: "I imagine it depends on the application program. In InDesign, there is a
    similar panel you can fill out; it overrides any choices the type designer makes.
    Dunno what Word does.\r\n\r\nBut then, if you are making good fractions, you should
    have a set of true-cut numerators and denominators, and their position IS determined
    by placement in the font -- just not through that panel -- at least, not in InDesign. "
