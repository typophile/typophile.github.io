  that made the logo used some random logo generator on a web site and then had a
  stroke and doesn't remember anything...\r\n\r\nThe video company is trying to match
  up the logo.  I need to buy the font (if I need to buy one).  I just need to get
  the right one.\r\n\r\nHere is where the logo is:  worldwidesolutionz.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo
