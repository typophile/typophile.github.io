<div class=commentbody>I came across this very thing not long ago. The editors wanted everything in the headline capitalized. I showed them the latest commarts, but it didn't really mean anything to them. =) I tried to reason it out saying that indefinite articles and prepositions shouldn't be capitalized, but then they said something like not all articles are indefinite. (ha, I made that up, but they said something like that.) Since I didn't have my 5th grade english book on hand, I said.. ok. But I ended up changing the headline style completely, to avoid the problem. ;) Those style books are awful though. The Kate Turabian, C MoS, etc, to me, are for term papers, not for design in the real world. They also say to use double hyphens with no mention of what an em dash is, and that sentences should have two spaces after them. I vote for whatever reads best, although one could argue that grammatical "mistakes" as some might call them hinder reading. Certainly "Masters Of The Universe" isn't as quick of a read, to me. But the power that the capitalized letters lends to the phrase shouldn't be overlooked. Although I think from the show, both of those were capitalized. Now I'm going to be looking up He-man websites all night to find out. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Steve is right. As long as you define your publication's style <br>and stick with it, the scheme doesn't matter so much. As <br>long as you're consistent your product will look professional. <br> <br>Ask the <i>New York Times</i>, they use an apostrophe in their <br>plural years (1990's) while nearly everyone else writes it <br>without the apos. Personally, I think it's a dumb choice, but <br>it looks right in the <i>Times</i> because they have used that <br>style consistently forever.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent Lew couldn't post this morn. He wishes to add this: <br> <br>Capitalization is generally an editorial matter, not a typographic one. This is definitely true in publishing, less so in advertising. <br> <br>As such, editorial style guides should be followed. There are valid arguments for various styles; the important thing is to determine a style and then apply it consistently. If you're working for a publishing client, you darn well better follow their editorial style. If not, then pick a style and stick with it. <br> <br>In establishing an editorial style, most publishers will follow one of the two main style guides -- The Chicago Manual of Style, which began as merely the house style of the University of Chicago Press but later became popular for its thoroughness and widely adopted by most other publishers; and AP style, which is the style of the Associated Press and is widely used by newspapers, as well as some publishers. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry to sound like a nitpicky editor, but I must clear the CMoS name on a couple of points. It doesn't say to use double hyphens instead of em dashes. (It says that in a manuscript, that is a piece of writing being prepared for eventual typesetting and publication, double hyphens should stand in for em dashes, which will then be replaced by the typesetter.) And it calls for only one space to follow a sentence. <br> <br>Turabian really is for papers. CMoS is for scholars and other non-publishing-types to prepare their work for eventual publication, and for editors in publishing to prepare that work for typesetting. That's a pretty big distinction. <br> <br>As someone who deals with both editorial and typographic matters, I tend to think it's possible to be picky about both without much conflict.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One advantage of the "All Initials Capitalized" style is that you don't get descenders on capitalized letters. Hence its poularity in the 1970's and 80's in hyper-tight, negative-leading ad headlines. And with word spaces reduced to less than zero, the capitalization served to differentiate words. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19537.jpg alt=8Ways> <br> <br>However, the disadvantage is that you also get the situation where the "f" of "Of" runs into the "T" of "The", bridging the space, especially in faces like Garamond. Not a problem in Palatino, though. <br> <br>These are the kind of typographic factors that can influence the style decision, quite apart from the purely editorial.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Its still better than 90% of all ad typography these days. At least its not set in Helvetica Extra Light Extended tracked to a +120. <br> <br>Remember that tight letter fit, and negative leading were a reaction to the freedom that photo-type brought after all of metal's limitations. Some of it was, no doubt, excessive. <br> <br>And we all know that the freedom brought by digital type never produced anything that was ugly or contrived, don't we now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry Karen (and anyone else who's currently tolerating me), I officially apologize for the style guide bashing! Next time I'll double check my facts. I was sure I had read it somewhere, but Turabian, in fact, says this: "The dash, which in printing is an elongated hyphen called an em dash, in typescript consists of two hyphens with no space..." etc. It was perhaps MLA that I was thinking of, which says "in typing, use two hyphens..." etc. <br> <br>I was mostly questioning the application of style guides for research papers to book publishing and advertising, although the posts that followed have helped me understand a bit more. <br>Seems like it boils down to 'typographic style' versus 'editorial style,' and I'm constantly learning about both</div>

<div class=commentbody>>they are so behind us <br> <br>What's done is done. There's no point in being "Era-ist". <br> <br>That way of doing things had its pros and cons, as does ours. <br> <br>Being aware of the difference makes both fascinating. <br> <br>Yes, Lubalin was a pioneer of tight setting in the 60s, but I believe the ability of the headline phototypositor (VGC 2" filmstrip?) to set overlapping type was what pointed typesetting in that direction, and the history of that goes back via Aaron Burns (a founder of ITC), to the 1950s. <br> <br>That's from my memory of a talk by Rod McDonald -- is there anything in print about the early history of display phototype? </div>
