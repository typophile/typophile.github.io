body: "1. Your thread will be on Google.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that not
  all clients want the work which you are doing for them in the search engines. Before
  you post work for critique keep this in mind because the search engines love Typophile.
  Sometimes it is best to keep things generic or, if you want to use the company name,
  consider only using images with the logo, etc., and ask that no one type the company
  name.\r\n\r\nWe don't wish for anyone to lose their jobs because of a thread on
  Typophile, but it is our policy not to delete threads and we don't delete them without
  consideration.\r\n\r\n2. Be helpful, but be polite.\r\n\r\nFurther,  if you don't
  have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. You may think you are offering
  \"friendly\" advice but your words say otherwise. It is one thing to give a fair
  critique, but if words such as \"don't mean to be rude, but this is awful\" or \"obviously
  you have no experience\" are part of what you wish to write perhaps just don't write
  anything. Silence is critique enough. \r\n\r\nWhile it might be true that thin skin
  is not helpful to a designer, Typophile does not need to be the place to scare anyone
  away. Everyone is on the same path, some further along that others. We are all here
  to learn and grow. Let's help each other.\r\n\r\n3. Nothing is free.\r\n\r\nAnd
  lastly, if you are here asking for people to design something for you without compensation\u2014or
  worse hiding it behind the guise of a contest\u2014thinking that the experience
  will be great on their resume this is not the place for you. Typophile does not
  support this practice. http://www.no-spec.com/"

    I could have posted it in 'general discusssions' but think this is a better place
    as there is already a thread in the main area for posting guidelines. Do you think
    it is unnecessary?

    discourse? Perhaps a separate section for \u201Canything about anything goes\u201D
    or a way to re-position threads? A very slippery slope. I\u2019ll almost certainly

  body: "<p>This has been a long time coming. It\u2019s old, but much of it still
    applies, and I am truly amazed at how people are still making the same mistakes
    we made a decade ago. Taken from <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html\">Jakob
    Nielsen\u2019s Alertbox, October 3, 2005: Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005</a>.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n2.
    Non-Standard Links  Following are the five main guidelines for links:\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Make obvious what\u2019s clickable: for text links, use colored, underlined text
    (and don't underline non-link text).  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Differentiate visited and
    unvisited links.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Explain what users will find at the other end of
    the link, and include some of the key information-carrying terms in the anchor
    text itself to enhance scannability and search engine optimization (SEO). <strong>Don\u2019t
    use \u201Cclick here\u201D or other non-descriptive link text</strong>.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Avoid JavaScript or other fancy techniques that break standard interaction techniques
    for dealing with links.\r\n\r\nIn particular, don\u2019t open pages in new windows
    (except for PDF files and such).</p> <p>Links are the Web's number one interaction
    element. Violating common expectations for how links work is a sure way to confuse
    and delay users, and might prevent them from being able to use your site.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nFor
    example, instead of linking \u201C<em>I just came across an interesting Kickstarter
    project. For more information, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese\">click
    here</a></em>\u201D (which provides the user with no information as to where they
    are going to end up without additionally reading the words around the ambiguous
    word \u201Chere,\u201D try:\r\n\r\n\u201C<em>I was doing a bit of reading, and
    I came across <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese\">an
    interesting Kickstarter project: Gremolata & Cancellaresca Milanese</a></em>.
    A graphic design project in new York, NY, by Russell Maret.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    remember: \u201CThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201D\r\n~

  body: Is this a FAQ or a discussion board? If it tries to be both, it will be a
    crappy one of each. If it truly is a FAQ, perhaps it should be locked. If someone
    has a point to make, or suggestion, such as good writing style, they can simply
    contact an admin and the FAQ can be modified accordingly. That would avoid the
    problem of people asking questions here, when they should be using other boards.

    Design posted a question about how to change the underline in InDesign so that
    it was a different weight, color, etc.  There was no solution listed, and I just
    figured it out and came upon you when i was doing my search. How do I go about
    posting the step by step solution? It may well have been that in 2003 there was
    no solution but there is now. \r\nAlso one of the folks in the group giving 'oh
    well' answers said, well, since typography is much more than typewriters now,
    we don't need underlines anymore. Not so. There continue to be studies going on
    in the direct marketing world about how people read, comprehend and respond to
    messaging in various typographic styles, and for some messaging, you want it to
    look as much like a typewriter as possible, or at least use less of our 'new-fangled'
    font versions and include underlines. People read more, and they buy more. And
    folks, that is how we get paid and get new jobs from former clients; when we know
    how to help them make money. \r\n\r\nAnyway if anyone wants a step by step i can
    try to set it up. It is easy once you know how. Cheers!"
