body: "I'm looking for some opinion on a choice of font for a book of poems. The mood
  of the book is somewhat despondent; poems of death, holocaust, graveyards, historical
  references to gruesome battles and struggles of faith. I'm thinking along the lines
  of Vendetta. Minion is too generic, Warnock is too happy. Fairfield is nice but
  it feels too much like old literature.\r\n\r\nI guess I want something with a just
  bit of an edge to it, but not so much as to distract from the reading.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a book of poems, not a novel, so pure function isn't so important.\r\n\r\nTell me
  if you think Vendetta, or someting like it might work. Any other suggestions are
  welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Emigre's Dalliance Script as long as the poems aren't too long. Its elegant and
    might provide an edge to the presentation.

    may be appropriate as it's very serious. But I think Vendetta is an excellent
    choice.

    it looks very sharp with enough line spacing, however it was a short book and
    the poetry was of a very contemporary style.\r\n\r\nMaybe it Storm's Serapion
    would do the job.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "It's hard so say what genre not knowing a great deal about poetry. From what
    I've read so far, it's not gothic, or dark really, yet the poems are about death
    and stuff. It's more like he's writing about these things from a distance, honestly,
    but with a certain degree of animosity. \r\n\r\nEldorado Micro is a bit too much,
    but the roman is quit fine. I love the hand-crafted feel of it. And Prospera is
    worth trying out for sure. Does the Prospera family contain more glyphs  than
    the website shows?"

  body: "Vendetta seems like quite a good choice. But I'm also getting this feeling
    that you need two distinct voices: something coarse but well-proportioned like
    Vendetta; but also something clinical and austere, like a Didone, an old-fashioned
    one, somewhat archaic, maybe turn-of-the-century French. As G W Ovink said*, \"Bodoni
    is an admirable letter for a death notice!\" The trick though would be choose
    two fonts that both contrast and match.\r\n\r\n* Actually, that's a collage of
    two of his phrases.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    says \"edge\" better than <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/penta.html\">Pentagramme</a>\r\nor
    if that a bit <em>too</em> edgy, try<a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/pentagraf.html\">Pentagraf</a>."
