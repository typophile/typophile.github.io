body: I am designing a logo for a tech company and they like the design finally &#40;after
  many, many tries&#41;. They like the look of the Helvetica Ultra Compressed for
  the &#34;text&#34;, but I don&#39;t like the way it looks in the address line. Is
  there a font that looks like HUC, but has a much shorter x-height and is extended?
  I want to maintain the &#34;techie&#34; look. The client loves the o&#39;s and the
  basic rectangular look of the letters.  <BR> <BR>Anything that I could use to complete
  the look without them knowing I&#39;m using a different font? And, please keep in
  mind this is only the first round of the final design, so it&#39;s still kind of
  rough. The address line seems to overwhelm the rest of the card and I want the rocket
  and the person&#39;s name to be the primary visuals. I&#39;d prefer to fill up more
  of the white space on the bottom line and to give it a lighter more futurist feel.  <BR>
  <BR>One more thing, the t at the end of rocket is a visual irritation to me. I&#39;m
  considering dropping the top of the t to the bottom of the e and moving the logic
  to left or just replacing it with a lowercase t. Any input? <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR><img

  body: Hi Dawn, <BR> <BR>If you are going for a futurist look I would stay away from
    Helvetica altogether. Too much of a 70s feel. There are many more sans serif fonts
    that would lighten up this card.  <BR> <BR>I would also look at making the address
    line a little bigger. Use flush left or right alignment to pull the name, title
    and address together. <BR> <BR>The false small caps on &#34;President&#34; should
    be replaced with either all caps, or title case. <BR> <BR>The problem with the
    E and the T is the space between the letters. Try pulling the T across and joining
    ET to lose this space.

  body: I agree with all your suggestions, however, the client doesn&#39;t want to
    change the format. Believe me, I&#39;ve tried. This is about the 100th idea and
    my original format for this version was different and they changed it to the above
    and finally found something they &#34;loved&#34;. So the changes I make have to
    be subtle or we&#39;ll be back redesigning &#40;design by committee with a lot
    of A types&#41;.  <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m not totally thrilled with it and want to
    add a little more class. I don&#39;t think I can change the font for &#34;LOGIC&#34;
    or the name. I tried setting the title in all caps, all lower case, upper and
    lower, and small caps and they only liked the above version for the title. I will
    try your suggestion on the ET and hope they won&#39;t notice. I truly appreciate
    the your input, though.  <BR> <BR>What other fonts would you suggest? Most of
    the other ones I&#39;ve tried were too round for the client and they didn&#39;t
    like them. They really are hooked on the rectangular shape of the letters.
