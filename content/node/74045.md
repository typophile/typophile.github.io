  from which he needs to match the title font. It has me stumped, and I really want
  to help him -- because he's not just a friend, he's also my ex-brother-in-law, the
  former husband of my sister, who died of metastatic brain cancer.\r\n\r\nSo few
  characters, so plain ... and both whatthefont and indentifont have failed to match
  it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brainmetsbc_4393.jpg]"

  body: Thanks Stephen, you've nailed it (and explained why it's scaled differently
    than any available sample at the same time).

  body: "Judging by the proportions (not to mention the fact that it's health-related),
    I think the missing font may have been Optima, letterspaced a bit.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maybe_3829.jpg]"
