    VGC, it's known as SANS SERIFS SHADED, and is one variant of the SANS SERIFS family.\r\n\r\nWith
    a little luck, we'll find if it's been digitized.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

    version is only a traced ScanFont version and not a properly drawn font. Steffmann's
    font is probably good enough for use at very small sizes only.\r\nThe hunt is
    still on! Any more suggestions?"

  body: "For \"old\" type buffs like myself, many of the typefaces I've used from
    the past haven't made it into the digital realm or were pooly translated.\r\n\r\nWhat
    adds to the problem of \"hunting down\" older typefaces is that names might be
    different, the designer has actually created a \"new\" version, or that it becomes
    hidden under a ridiculous category like \"Fancy\" or \"Unique\"!\r\n\r\nThe game
    is afoot! or is it \"The game is a face\" or \"The face is afoot\"?\r\n\r\nBTW-
    what is the application you intend? Long or short text? Cap sizes larger than
    5 inches? Five feet? If you only need a few letters, it might be easier to find
    someone who can set it using photo-headliner, etc.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

  body: "This might help those who have joined the hunt.\r\n\r\nBy my recollection
    only (I'm not near my reference library), the Sans Serif Shaded was part of the
    T.J. Lyons Collection of Wood Types that Letraset originally licensed before Agfa-Compugraphic.\r\n\r\n<strong>CORRECTION:</strong>
    Sans Serif Shaded originally came from the foundry of Stephenson Blake & Co. and
    NOT T.J. Lyons\r\n\r\nThe shaded version became wildly popular in late '60s --
    early '70s, making its way onto many bookcovers and record albums (you know, those
    big black round flat things before CDs).\r\n\r\nI remember being amazed that the
    design originated from an old wood type, since to me it seemed very contemporary.
    Gee, it was old, but came back in style!\r\n\r\nSomeone please correct me if my
    recollection is wrong, as I wouldn't want to create false history.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm Sans Serifs Shaded!"

    doesn't appear in any of the Castcraft Designer Collections, but you could contact
    them. Be ready to pay a premium for one of their fonts, though.
