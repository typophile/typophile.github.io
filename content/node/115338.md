  body: "Well, it's a font... but I haven't been able to find it. The double-s ligature
    suggests more than an amateur design effort. I have searched MyFonts, Dafont and
    AbstractFonts. The only other likely source is Veer, which I will check next.\r\n\r\nAny
    information about what this is from, and how old it is? If it's commercial, I
    suppose it could be a custom font design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "No luck at Veer. Either their keywords are not helpful, or they just don't
    have it.  \r\n\r\nIf you just need something similar it seemed that [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/corradine+fonts/fonts/?refby=bowfin|Corradine
    Fonts]] had a few with a similar 'untrained' script look. Especially Prissa, Rapidda,
    Helga and Corradine Handwriting.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
