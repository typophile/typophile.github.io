However, I would say that you shouldn&rsquo;t just include the computer image of your graphics but its applications in the real world. For example, let us see your logos on collateral pieces. That would be a nice touch on top of the computer image.</p>
<p>Your logos have too many colors in my opinion (max should always be around 3/4) and you should always include the black/white version.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would add a very thin border to the Nebraska and Nationalites ones to define the edge. (Although the Nebraska one seems to have it already in the PDF version.)</p>
<p>I agree with the comment about showing collateral pieces (a good mockup is fine), and also that a good black &amp; white version is needed for every logo, but if you show a b&amp;w version too I&rsquo;d make it small (electronic media in full color is rapidly replacing print). That would also show the logo works in a small size.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think the 3 or 4 color idea is as important as it used to be (unless it just looks better that way). The client gets free color in electronic media, and in print media can use 4-color process if the budget allows or one color in budget jobs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">My point was that kids today have computer graphics skills and kids in fifth grade do play with PhotoShop - Craig has gone way beyond that but the kids are coming up fast behind him and he has to continue to learn and improve. He&rsquo;s off to a good start but more training and yes, practice is what will keep him ahead of the next wave of designers. And we need to point out that most firms that hire designers look at degrees as a necessary requirement. But in the end learning more is what it is about not just getting better at what we already know.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You both make good points and an associates degree is a good place to start - my point is that may not be the job you want to have for the rest of your career. And what you say about only needing a Masters if you want to teach may be good advice today but not in ten years. Maybe a BFA in Design and an MBA might be a good combo (or Marketing, Communications, or Advertising). No one path is good for everyone and I know good designers who have no degrees and are successful, just do not close off options early in your working life. A good college education does not just make you &ldquo;book smart&rdquo; it teaches you to think and to see beyond what you know. If you are only learning computer programs and techniques in your courses realize you do need more than just that to become a true &ldquo;creative.&rdquo;</div>

<p>I think it does not look too bad, but the scope is still a bit limited. You show off mostly logos, but a logo is mostly only part of an identity, so show how it is used in the context, where possible.
The Boy Scouts of America Mid-America Council seems to be a good client, so try to show more of the work you did for them, like posters, brochure covers but also content pages showing detailed typography. You could also show some sketches to highlight the thinking behind the work.</p>
<p>Try to really make your Portfolio stand out, select only the best works, and the works that best highlight the skills you have. I don&rsquo;t really understand some of the choices you made, and why some stuff is in your online portfolio but not in the PDF, and vice versa. IMHO I would ditch the Nebraska posters, as I do not think it is very inspired, quite generic. If you want to use this portfolio to get hired in a good firm, it should really make you stand out, and be original.</p>
<p>just my 50 ¢&hellip;</p>

<p>Obviously the quality of your work is very important, but personality can also be important. A successful designer once said to me &ldquo;most clients are not design experts and can&rsquo;t tell good work from great work, but they know instantly if you&rsquo;re friendly and likeable and are giving them good service.&rdquo; He was right.</p>
<p>Sure, there are designers with bad personalities that are still successful. But in general, in professions that deal with clients a good personality is a big plus.</p>
