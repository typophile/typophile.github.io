  I've clicked \"generate kern feature\" and \"compile\". Does anyone know what's
  causing it?"

  body: You need at least one more OpenType feature for class based kerning to work.
    The kern table all on its own won't work. So, add a fractions feature, ligatures
    or something else. Then it should kick in.

  body: Yes. And perhaps you better avoid generating a kern table (check the export
    options) especially if you do not decompress kerning when you risk getting different
    kerning in different environments.

    option "Export old-style [etc]" should be deactivated. Or if you cannot resist,
    then at least activate the sub-option "expand class kerning while [etc]".

    kerning and why that might give different kerning in different environments?

  body: "(What Mr Larabie alludes to is not an FLS5 bug but a bug in your version
    of InDesign.)\r\n\r\nAn OpenType-savvy application is expected to read kerning
    from the GPOS table, from one or more lookups associated with the kern feature.
    Defining a kern feature (which goes into the GPOS table) should do.\r\nIf you
    provide kerning both in the GPOS table and in a kern table, and if you do not
    decompress the kerning that goes into the kern table, then you have different
    kinds of kerning at two places in the font: full kerning in the GPOS table, keyglyph-only
    kerning in the kern table. And depending from which place an application takes
    the information, it will either get this or that kerning.\r\n\r\nWhat you define
    in the Metrics Window is kerning for keyglyphs and perhaps exceptions. You kern
    only A-V but not Adieresis-V Aacute-V and expect that class definitions will care
    for the latter two pairs.\r\nIf you generate a kern feature and then generate
    an OpenType font, the GPOS table will contain full kerning as results from both
    your keyglyph kerning and your class definitions.\r\nIf you also generate a kern
    table, then FLS5 will by default only consider kerning as defined in the Metrics
    Window but ignore the classes. Which means that the kern table will contain kerning
    only for keyglyphs (and exception), kerning for A-V but not for Adieresis-V Aacute-V.*\r\nDepending
    on whether an application picks the kerning from the GPOS table or from the kern
    table, the user will get more (GPOS) or less (kern) kerning -- and as you noticed
    this can be fewer kerning pairs than you want ...\r\n\r\n* For the kern table
    to contain the full kerning, you need to activate the additional \"decompress\"
    option. But as said, I consider it as a bad idea to provide kerning in both the
    GPOS and the kern table. If an application cannot deal with OT layout tables,
    then the application has a problem, not the font."
