  body: It&#39;s custom drawn, but based on Didot. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/didot/linotype-didot-initials/testdrive.html?s=VOGUE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Linotype Didot Initials</a> is fairly close. Another good one
    is <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/didot/index.html" target="_blank">HTF
