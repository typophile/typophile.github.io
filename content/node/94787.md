body: Vector logo in B/W attached. The logo can be also seen on their website http://www.benettiyachts.it/
  according to which they have been around since 1873 - however I don't know when
  the logo was created. I think the first letter 'B' may be custom which I don't really
  need ID'd. I am mainly trying to find out the font that was used for the 'enetti'
  part of the logo.

  body: Thank you Ryuk for your suggestions. I am creating a logo for a customer who
    wants this to closely resemble the Benetti logo. I went with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/mayfair/|Mayfair]]
    which was a decent starting point for the logo design. Thanks again.!
