body: "I've come across an interesting typographical dillema in the face I'm creating
  - which happens to be a 'pixel-font'.\r\n\r\nThe typical thing to do, would be to
  size the Q and O characters proportionally the same in the grid, simply adding any
  variation of the cross-bar below to make the Q. The thing that I'm finding, however,
  is that if I extend the Q character one additional pixel, the cross-bar [at the
  corner] appears 'aesthetically correct', even though the two characters are now
  proportionally distinct.\r\n\r\nI guess then, I'm wondering if anyone can offer
  their feedback - opinions toward to what extent should we feel it necessary to break
  certain rules in favor of the aesthetic? Or, would making such changes be a severe
  no-no in your opinions?\r\n\r\nAnd - in referencing some typefaces that are centuries
  old - it appears that a distinct Q was often used that was non-proportional to the
  O character. Thus, is there really a 'rule' afterall, if one can reference typography
  of the past?\r\n\r\n(Perhaps I'm over-thinking this issue?)\r\n"

    trying to determine whether to go with my gut intuition in this case and stick
    with the aesthetic that was 'working' - or conceed to the 'rules'.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the environmental procedures I've been incorporating in the testing phases
    of these typefaces - is to use them in a Win 98 theme. (Yes, I'm Windoze.) That's
    really where I noticed the extent that it works in this particular face - though,
    it disturbed me no end!\r\n"

    Unfortunately, I located someone beginning to 'rip' where I was going with the
    typefaces - whom was located through my analytics on my site. I don't care to
    point fingers at people - I just take down the demonstrations as a result of anothers'
    apparent unoriginality.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame that some people do that. Then again,
    I should probably have learned by now that this is the type of thing that can
    happen as a result of being open and demonstrating progress. It kind of saps the
    fun out of it, if you know what I mean.\r\n"

    looks right to your eyes -- but do post examples, so that folks can give you feedback!
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nI once expressed my fears of posting my own font projects here to
    one of Typophile's founders, and he (I believe it was Jared, but maybe it was
    both Joe AND Jared) said to me, \"If you have something posted on Typophile, with
    a time and date, it would be proof that it was your idea if someone came along
    later and tried to rip you off.\" Just a thought to encourage you.  :-)"

    body: "Thank you, Ricardo. The original production versions were posted in a Flash
      file, with logged dates in the process. I'm not particularly concerned with
      that aspect of it. What I am concerned with, is potentially having gone a particular
      'original' route that can easily become modified by others. At this time, I
      don't see it being necessary to post an example as it was primarily a research
      study question.\r\n\r\nTo update on that research progress, however, I spent
      the last few days digging centuries back in the etymology of the 'O' glyph form.
      As it turns out, the 'O' is a very modern representation that's only more modernly
      depicted with the 'Q' character's geometry. In proper English and in the Western
      / North-American and in various Latin cultures, for instance -- the modern 'O'
      (or 'o') can be considered somewhat of a 'bastardization' of pronounciations
      -- thus, making it a highly subjective glyph.\r\n\r\nThough, I do understand
      the need for 'balancing' the 'O' with the 'Q' for most aesthetic reasons --
      I've come away with this subtle bit of historical information that has enlightened
      me to a certain extent as to how I wish to proceed.\r\n\r\nI'll post examples
      eventually, of course. Don't mean to be a poopy-head about it. Just that it
      turned into something rather 'important' for me at this time.\r\n"
