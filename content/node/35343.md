  for my BFA in the fall. Just recently, I have started my first freelance job, but
  I feel like a lost puppy. I do not have a logo put together yet (it's a work in
  progress), and I have several questions with not many people to help answer.\r\n\r\nMy
  question is - what are some good books out there (reasonably priced, no more than
  $40) that I can grab at a local bookstore that gives me tips and a guide on how
  to start out freelance graphic design?  Certain topics that come to my mind that
  I would like answers for would be hourly rates, coming up with invoices, printing,
  etc.\r\n\r\nMuch help appreciated- thank you!\r\n-Melissa"

    design is no place for the inexperienced. Get a job somewhere and learn about
    the business. After a few years maybe freelance will be an option, but not right
    out of college."

  body: 'I second James''s advice. It''s going to be awfully hard to establish a successful
    freelance design business with no real work experience. I recommend you figure
    out what sort of design work interests you most and try to a job in that field
    for at least a few years before you strike out on your own. You can try to do
    some freelance work on the side both to broaden your portfolio and to try to line
    up some clients for when you''re ready to launch your own business. '

  body: "i started out -- fresh from school -- as a freelancer. it was hard work,
    but i think you really have to have the temperment for it. one example: no matter
    how hard you're working, and how much work is coming in, you never really feel
    like you're off the clock. you're watching a movie, and there's a nagging feeling
    you should be making those calls or checking those invoices...\r\n\r\nanyway,
    i don't think i would have made it if i had known any better. but i didn't know
    anything, and i was able to pull it off. with any sense, i would have been scared
    witless.\r\n\r\nreminds me of an episode of \"gilligan's island\"... gilligan
    made a pair of wings from some feathers, straps them on and starts flying over
    the huts. the skipper sees him and yells, \"what're you doing? you can't fly!\"
    \ \"i can't?\" says gilligan, and he falls to the ground.\r\n"

  body: "Well, you can start out as a freelancer, of course. The point others are
    making (which I agree with) is that you are only partially baked when you come
    out of school, and you have to have a few years experience working to be fully
    done. Now you can get those years as a freelancer, but is it a service to your
    customers to pay you to learn? \r\n\r\nAnd when you work with someone with more
    experience, you don't have to make the same expensive mistakes. Your cohort can
    explain why something won't work, and save you the aggravation (and expense, if
    you are freelance) of making a major error.\r\n\r\nSo, while you can start as
    a freelancer, it makes a lot more sense to get a few years under your belt before
    you go on your own. "

    was saying she just wants to freelance (as opposed to finding a staff position
    somewhere), just that she was doing her FIRST freelance assignment, and wanted
    some business advice. some of which, as others stated, might include \"work for
    someone else for a while.\""

  body: "Thank you all for your responses!\r\n\r\nI may have confused some people
    - I am NOT thinking about becoming a full time freelancer straight out of school,
    as some others have mentioned.  As Chuck was saying, I am just doing this on the
    side.  I am interning now at a newspaper company working on several advertisements
    - and it just so happened that a partner from the newspaper company decided asked
    me to work on an ad that would not be related to my newspaper ads. \r\n\r\nBut
    thinking that I will probably be doing more freelance jobs in the future, whether
    it be when I am still in school or working in the industry full-time, I'm just
    trying to get a head start to know the many aspects of freelancing.\r\n\r\nThe
    books are for short-term reading, and hopefully long-term reading.  I've already
    picked up the Graphic Art's Guild Pricing & Ehthical Guidelines book from my local
    library. "

  body: I'm just saying that there are many studios that won't involve junior staff
    in the business side. Sure, you might attend some meetings, that is a plus, but
    you don't see or get to understand the billing which really is just as important
    as creative if you want to make a living in design.

  body: "<cite>the billing which really is just as important as creative if you want

    should be learning skills at a studio or company that does work that you admire,
    and hopefully pick up some good portfolio pieces. Making good connections is also
    very important. \r\n\r\nThe business side is just not that hard to learn and if
    you put yourself in a good position, through your talent and your contacts, you'll
    figure it out as you go along. It can also vary widely depending on what kind
    of design you want to do. More than billing, I'd say it's important to learn what
    clients expect and how to deal with them.\r\n\r\nBut I'd make my first priority
    trying to get a foot in the door at a place you think you could do good work."
