body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nWe have numerous enquiries from customers who are
  using old style Helvetica.  They in turn are then advised by their design agency's
  to use Neue Helvetica instead, but then they always ask the question about what
  are the differences?  I am sure to the untrained eye the fonts do look very similar,
  but I am hoping that the Typographic community here can expand further.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I am particularly interested in is\r\n\r\nDifference in character shapes\r\nAny
  difference in kerning\r\nAny pro's/cons of upgrading to Neue Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI
  have searched the web for answers, but I would feel more confident in the information
  that I can receive here.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nNeil\r\n"

    width and weights similar to Univers by Adrian Frutiger.\r\n\r\nThere are slight
    differences between the shapes and Neue always seems to be slightly more rounded
    with p d q b.\r\n\r\nThe tail in t for Neue is slightly longer.\r\n\r\nWith your
    other two queries its probably better someone else handles them.\r\n\r\nDavid."

  body: "Neil,\r\n\r\nOne of the big differences is that whereas the various weights
    of Helvetica were drawn by different type designers at different times, Helevetica
    Neue was conceived as a large family from the get-go (it also has more weights
    than Helvetica), and has consistent variations from one weight to the next. The
    series of weights are named and organized in a manner similar to the Univers family;
    that is, using two-digit numbers (i.e., 55=Roman, 65=Medium, 75=Bold, etc. Numbers
    ending in 5 are upright weights; those ending in 6 are Italics; numbers ending
    in 7 are Condensed; numbers ending in 3 are Extended).\r\n\r\nMore info here...\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/\r\n\r\n...and

  body: "> the various weights of Helvetica were <strong>drawn</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
    various weights of \"new\" Helvetica were not \"drawn\", but generated mechanically.
    You can trace this mechanical generation by the foot serif of the right stem of
    the capital R, comparing them with obtuse and petering foot serifs of old Helvetica.\r\n\r\nsee
    http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/r.gif\r\n\r\nThe expression \"new\" Helvetica
    was a publicity stunt.\r\nThe \"new\" Helvetica was definitely not a new design."

  body: "Neue Helvetica also corrects some the weird little things that people who
    like to nitpick would notice. Compare the shapes of upper-case <strong>O</strong>
    in the original and neue and you will see what I mean. Combining those little
    tweaks with the weight adjustments and consistency fixes produced\u2014at least
    in my opinion\u2014a typeface that\u2019s much more attractive than the original,
    especially in the lighter weights."

    just amazed that the design agencies are telling them to use Neue Helvetica and

    Comic Sans. But Neil is in the UK\u2014I guess they\u2019re just smarter about

    a design consultant has been paid a lot of money, it's nearly impossible to argue
    against them. Many companies don't want their internal decision making process
    to degrade into a Typophile thread. Linotype should sell Helevetica subscriptions."

    question is this one:\r\n\r\nWas \"Neue Helvetica\" (\"New\" Helvetica) registered
    as as \"new\" design at the German design office?\r\n\r\nAs only \"new\" (\"neue\")
    designs are eligible for registration, it is forbidden and punishable to cheat
    the design office by registering a non-new design as \"new\" design.\r\n\r\n<strong>PS
    added:</strong> I now found out whether the German design office was cheated,
    but Typophiles prefer publicity (www.helveticafilm.com) to facts."
