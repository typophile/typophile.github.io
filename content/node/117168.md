  both top and bottom fonts. They look so familiar and yet I haven't been able to
  figure them out.\r\n\r\nThis was created sometime between the 40's and 60's. I don't
  know exactly when though. The Bates type seems to be related to Caslon, based on
  the A. But I'm not sure what other fonts were used in the era that would have similar
  characteristics.\r\n\r\nAny feedback or direction would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bates_4943.jpg]"

  body: "As for the second one, note the variation in repeating letters. For example
    the width of the counters in _PP_  are obviously different.\r\nThe creator of
    this lettering would probably have known about Eden [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EdenInUse_6550.jpg]
    which was designed, in light and bold weights by Robert H. Middleton 1934. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/eden-ct/\r\nThe
    kinked leg on the R is a design idea -- source unknown -- adopted in a 2004 font
    called Concrete [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ConcreteInUse_3711.jpg] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/transkrypt/concrete/
    and in some other futuristic constructed fonts. \r\nDon"

  body: "As for _BATES_ I share your opinion that the lettering looks somewhat like
    a Caslon. If you are attempting to replicate it you could use a Calson Italic
    and edit as required. But Caslon is too light for the letters. You might also
    consider sloping ITC Grouch or Grumpy and editing. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-grouch/

    body: That was really helpful Don! Gave me some great places to start from. Even
      though those weren't exactly the fonts, looking at the details of them helped
      to guide some of the decisions I had to make in regards to the how some areas
      terminated and things like that.  I'm almost done with it and hopefully the
      client loves it. Thanks!
