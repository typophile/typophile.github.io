  body: "Hmm, now that I see them together, it looks like Ingrid is only similar.
    Upon further looking in the Script Guide, I think this is a Casaday & Greene font
    called Gazelle (a.k.a. Gaze). See the attached image, which is rather fuzzy quality.
    I can see why you may think it is hand-drawn, but don't you think those r's are
    awfully like each other, to the point of being identical?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GazelleC_5982.gif]"

    was due to the fact it was a digi pic of a shop front that I pulled the text from.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks."
