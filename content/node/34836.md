  a guest for a little while now. I love the site, the design and the ideas discussed
  - hope I can add something to the discussion where appropriate, but warning now,
  self taught know-nothing in most respects... \r\n\r\nSo - the question - I was wondering
  if there was a respectable open source or free-to-use (for non-commercial applications
  even) win32 or OSX program that people are using to build fonts with?\r\n\r\nWhat
  kind of programs are used to make fonts for linux distributions too? Is there a
  gpl tool which is used... or are people using commercial applications to build things
  which are then donated to the distirbutions..?\r\n\r\nThanking kindly!\r\n\r\nDan"

    of a Fontographer clone for Type1 fonts only, but has grown considerable sophistication
    for TT and OpenType as well.\r\n\r\nMy own fonts, including Inconsolata, are developed
    using my <a href=\"http://levien.com/spiro/\">Spiro</a> tools. The underlying
    math is quite sophisticated, but the polish and packaging to make it a smooth,
    easy-to-use app is absolutely not there yet. I will continue to chip at the code
    in support of those goals, but I expect progress to be very slow unless considerable
    new energy comes into the project from other collaborators.\r\n\r\nSee also Dave
    Crossland's talk at <a href=\"http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2007/program.html\">LGM</a>
    (audio and video links of the presentation inside that link). There is a bit of
    information about less mainstream tools on the <a href=\"http://openfontlibrary.org/wiki/index.php/Tools\">OFLib
    Wiki</a> as well.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n"

  body: "FontForge [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/]] (that what Raph mentioned)
    is a tool for developing fonts, free to use and modify under \"essentially the
    revised BSD license\". It is a UNIX type of program, but has builds that work
    under X11 on MacOSX and Cygwin on Windows.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Also, Adobe, Microsoft, and Apple all have font development utilities they
    distribute free of charge from their respective web sites. They perform very important
    technical functions but do not handle design. I haven't figured out much about
    them but I'm sure other typophiles are more familiar with them.
