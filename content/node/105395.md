  body: "Interesting. I spent some time trying to track this down.\r\nOilzum has been
    around as a product for well over a century. The design of the central logo seems
    to be pre WWI. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OilzumFullSign_4244.jpg]\r\nHere
    is all of the lettering that encircles the logo.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OilzumLettering_5789.jpg]\r\nI
    am have not determined when the lettering was added to the logo to make the Oilzum
    sign, other than it was some time in the first half of the 20th century.\r\nThe
    style is thick and thin sans, developed from the 1890s onward  in fonts such as
    Taylor Gothic, Studley and Globe Gothic. It is found in only a few American typefaces
    from the 20th century.\r\nI checked my file collection and did not find a match.\r\nPending
    a check of McGrew's American Metal Typefaces, I suggest that this is well executed
    hand lettering with the flavor of the three mentioned fonts.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: 'Thank you Don for taking the time to look into it, I think it''s a really
    nice looking font and being done by hand is really well done. There were some
    close matches out there but most were serif fonts and the w was always wrong.
    I''ll have a look at those fonts you mentioned. '
