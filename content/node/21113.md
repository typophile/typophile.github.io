  printers. (Minolta Konica 2400w, Hp Color Laserjet 2600 or 1600, etc.)\r\n\r\n1.
  How is print quality in color? \r\n2. How is text in color? \r\n3. Is quality passable
  for printing serious invitation stuff(type extensive)?\r\n4. How is print quality
  in color laser printers in general?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJoseph"

  body: "I just bought a Xerox phaser 8500 (solid ink laser).\r\n\r\nThe colour is
    great - pretty accurate, but I'm not super impressed with the resolution.\r\n\r\nLaser
    printer text will be pretty sharp as long as you're not using too light a screen
    of any color. The ink will also have a bit of a sheen to it.\r\n\r\nIf invites
    are your biggest concern, I've had good luck out-sourcing the laser printing to
    a high end service bureau. You can source the paper yourself from any of the large
    manufacturers.\r\n\r\nLuke."
