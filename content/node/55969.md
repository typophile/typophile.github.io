    has that awkward little jump. The g looks the most different. Maybe customized
    a bit? \r\n\r\nJohan Vilchez"

    but for the most part the fonts there are atrocious with limited to no families,
    terrible kerning pairs, bad proportions, etc...\r\nI'm sorry if you're a fan,
    but anything with <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/handvetica.font\">\"Handvetica\"</a>
    is going to scare me away. Who knows. Maybe I'm just a purist at heart.\r\n\r\nJohan
