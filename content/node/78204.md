body: "I'm going to be paying a short visit to San Francisco in a few weeks and was
  wondering if anyone here has any bookstore recommendations. I'm not particularly
  looking for bookstores that sell books that are still in print, although if there
  is a bookstore that has a particularly fantastic design section, I might check it
  out anyway. What I'm really looking for are antiquarian booksellers, especially
  sellers that carry the usual suspects (books on the history of typography, printing,
  the book trade, writing systems, calligraphy, and graphic design).\r\n\r\nI'll be
  driving around a bit, so recommendations in the surrounding environs are OK, too.
  But I don't have time to make any longer trips to any other parts of the state,
  unfortunately."

  body: <a href="http://www.brickrow.com/cgi-bin/brickrow">Brick Row</a> is probably
    the best antiquarian shop in San Francisco. It is located in office space at 49
    Geary Street, near Union Square. <a href="http://www.johnwindle.com">John Windle</a>
    is in the same building, and I purchased a nice Estienne leaf book there on my
    last visit.

  body: "If you're in Northbeach (A San Francisco neigborhood just north of Chinatown,
    which is on most people's list anyway), try \"William Stout Architectural Books\".\r\n\r\nIt's
    not an antiquarian bookstore, but it does have a small, dense typography section
    plus a good design section. They have two locations now. The Northbeach one is
    better (I think).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stoutbooks.com/cgi-bin/stoutbooks.cgi/results_splash.html?cat1=Design&cat2=Typography"
