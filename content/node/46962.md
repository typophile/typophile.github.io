  impression that it generates tabular oldstyle figures, fake titling letters and
  figures, fake smallcaps, and the appropriate scripts, and that I can go adjust all
  of the outlines to make it work right. But it doesn\u2019t appear to be documented,
  so maybe I\u2019m wrong. What\u2019s going on here?"

    main purpose of the macros is to show off some Python scripting. They are certainly
    not all \"production ready\", and haven't been updated in a while. I'm pretty
    sure the one you're referring to generates bad glyph names which would need to
    be fixed. \r\n\r\nAdam"
