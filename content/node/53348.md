  much to put myself up to be knocked down by others), but recently did a logo concept
  for a chauffeur business. They wanted something elegant, that was type based. Now
  I know it's Trajan (yes I know, burn me at the stake), but they probably don't want
  to stump up for Requiem.\r\n\r\nJust interested to know what you guys think, as
  it's one of only a few logos I've done which really focus on type forms instead
  of more \"in yer face\" graphic device based identities.\r\n\r\nBe gentle, but firm!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's just the S glyph from Trajan that ships with CS3. It has been rotated
    ever so slightly, and obviously modified to blend into the C. I found that without
    the rotation, once I had shaved the top off it, it seems to be visually leaning
    over. It's only a few degrees, so hopefully it hasn't changed the character of
    the remaining glyph.

  body: Jan, do you mean the tracking on the type or the spacing between the main
    elements?

  body: "I'd also let the S and C connect more smoothly at the bottom. The C seems
    to end slightly lower than the S.\r\n\r\nAlso, stump of for Requiem... it only
    costs $199 for 1 CPU, which gets you the whole family."

  body: "I too would suggest opening up the letterspacing for the company name, this
    would allow you adjust the kerning for more even-looking letterspacing.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it the lack of alignment between the break in the bottom of the logo (between
    the two letters) and the center of the ornament below bothers me. Perhaps if you
    were to remove the center diamond from the ornament the lack of alignment would
    be less noticable.\r\n\r\nOverall though, a good solution for the logo.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

  body: "I'd just make the transitials between the two letters follow the form a bit
    more naturally. They flat edges seem very abrupt.\r\n\r\nAlso, the tail of the
    R seems to be creating some problems in letterspacing. I'd kern accordingly."

    doesn't space things very well on its own.\r\nThis not perfect (could spend all
    day tweaking this) but I think its a bit more like it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Page-1_4188.gif]\r\nI
    agree the logo/lig does look centered because of the dot in the line"

    meet with the client again, but will post the final version once it's been tidied
    up. Thanks for all of your comments.... hopefully I'll be able to address most
    if not all.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd suggest repeating CS on the bottom as well, so viewers don't get confused
    about the reasoning behind the S on the top. The way it is, it looks like \"Corporate
    Chauffeurs\" is an explanation of the initials at the top, and that's gonna cause
    come confusion.\r\n\r\nI think \"CS Corporate Chauffeurs\" would make more sense,
    but that might not be what the client wants. I'd give it a try, for clarity's
    sake."

  body: "I like the word logo/ligature. Pretty clever and quite well done. What about
    rotating it back 1 or 2 degrees? It looks like it's going to keel over. As for
    the lines at the bottom, another face perhaps..too much of Trajan gives me a bad
    taste in the mouth. Maybe Gotham or something similar at the bottom? Or maybe
    a slab serif. Maybe space out those letters more as well..\r\n\r\n"

    - I actually like the Avenir idea. It gives the whole thing an air of Art Deco.
    I'm meeting the client this week, so brace yourselves! I'm sure there are going
    to be many changes!
