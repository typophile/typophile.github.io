  typography for a local design event.\r\n\r\nWhile Hustwit's <em>Helvetica</em> is
  a must-see gem, I realize most people have seen it. Adding it to my program would
  be okay, but I'm pretty sure there are other quality projects out there.\r\n\r\nI
  already have a preliminary list, but I'd like to have the opinion of the Typophile
  community. I want to surprise my audience with new films and / or hard to find documentaries.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions ?\r\nHave you heard of new films coming out soon ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot
  in advance !\r\n\r\n- -\r\n\r\n(by the way, excuse my average english...)"

    a few documentaries and specials (as part of a culture program) about typographers
    or the graphic arts in general. I recorded a few of those. If you are interested

    is selling tickets for general admission. TypeCon attendees are guaranteed a seat
    (if you check it off on your registration).\r\n\r\nSome folks may remember that
    Justine Nagan gave a preview of some of the footage at last year's TypeCon in
    Buffalo. We're very excited to welcome her back to TypeCon to debut the finished
    documentary."
