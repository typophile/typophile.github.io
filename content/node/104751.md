  body: seems like maybe [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/memphis/extra-bold/|Memphis]],
    possibly extra bold. if there's an italic, then yay. otherwise do a manual slant?

  body: "I thought about Memphis as well but looked for something closer. Memphis
    has the angled slab serif to terminate the horizontal strokes for Extra Bold,
    but not for the weight shown in the image. A font with with the angled slab serif
    at the right weight is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/adelle/\">Adelle
    Extra Bold</a> by TypeTogether. The Adelle Extra Bold is lighter the Memphis Extra
    Bold and narrower, i.e. a better fit to the image. Do a manual slant, shorten
    the midstoke on E and you should be pretty close.\r\nPerhaps someone has an exact
    match?\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "interesting. i'm sticking with Memphis. i feel the strokes match better,
    and the lowercase that goes along requires no modification. Adelle's lc does not
    match the same style. quick sample of Memphis EB with a distortion.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/memphisfauxitalic_4767.jpg]"
