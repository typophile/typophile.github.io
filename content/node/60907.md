    mean Janson Text</a>, right?\r\nThe OpenType versions of Janson Text from Linotype
    do have oldstyle figures (osf), also in the Italics. There\u2019s no extra tabular
    osf, but the default osf all share the same width, thus they virtually <em>are</em>
    tabular and do align verti\xADcally.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/janson-italic-osf_5135.png]\r\nF"

  body: No. Linotype offers a PostScript Version of Janson Text Italic with OSF numerals.
    The Monotype version of Janson Text Italic offers them in the OpenType version.
