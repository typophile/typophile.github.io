body: A special image-free type ID post. I have a vague idea of a sans that I believe
  is fairly well-known, that has an angle on the top arm of the E, and possibly an
  angle on the bottom arm, too. That's all you've got to work with. Any ideas?

  body: "Thanks, you two! I not sure Bliss is what I'm thinking of, but it's definitely
    the closest. Kabel certainly fit my description, but I should have been more specific
    about the angular direction: the opposite of Kabel. And Meta's angles are too
    subtle.\r\n\r\nAny more wild stabs?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: Finnegan, Vista and Auto are too subtle, Vonness is more like it. I still
    think <a href="http://www.typography.net/samplers/bliss/bliss_heavy/index.htm">Bliss</a>
    is probably closest so far. Hm. Maybe that is it...

    ends, and so does the arm of the L. Any idea what it is? Of course, it could easily
