  when a capital Y is next to a Capital A I would like to have the Y snuggle up real
  close with the A, but when the Y is next to a T I don't want it to overlap nearly
  as much.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    you should create many kerning pairs, but make sure your underlying spacing is
    as even as possible first.
