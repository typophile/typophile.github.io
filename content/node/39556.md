body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm working on this project called Mentorskap (swedish for mentorship).\r\n\r\nIt's
  a practical training projekt at my school for students studying at different health
  care programs, social studies and physical therapy.\r\n\r\nThis project brings in
  people from the field to help the students with their practical training, a mentor.\r\n\r\nI've
  narrowed it down to three elements that I want to present in the logo. The student,
  mentor and the school.\r\n\r\nIn these three sketches the student i the yellow part,
  the box is the school (a box with four sides representing the four years of each
  program) and the small line beside the yellow part is the mentor.\r\n\r\nAny feedback
  you can give is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nPeter[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mentorskap_logo_comp_1_4046.jpg]"

  body: It's the student evolving through the "school" or the four years of education.
    Starts out small and then grows and evolves to a finished educated individual.

  body: "Only for Finland and yes. It's a very small thing, will mostly be visible
    to students at my school and the places where they do they're practical training.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the a circle on top I'll give it a shot but it would be a fourth element that
    I wouldn't have an explanation for, also it might start looking like some variation
    of a stick figurine and I really don't want that.\r\n\r\nPersonally I like that
    the square symbolizes the school, studying can be very boring and repetitive.
    Then having the \"student\" breaking free and evolving is a nice thought.\r\n\r\nGonna
    try some more experiments with the first one. The arrow is kind of clich\xE9 but
    it doesn't look half bad.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback so far."

  body: "As it stands I am not getting the breaking free motif, the school black needs
    to be less dynamic and the yellow needs to be more fluid and actually bursting
    out of the black. In fact in the last two iterations I first saw, and now can't
    get out of my mind, a cartoon duck's bill.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: If the yellow field/swoosh stands for progress, don't you think it will be
    more clear if you do a  horizontal flip of the symbol? I read it from left to
    right and as it is now the yellow field decreases...

    consider the placement of the two elements (icon & logotype), because they're
    fighting a bit right now. In the earlier options, both on one line worked."

    were great fun.\r\n\r\nNot sure about the icon on any of the versions though --
    you'd have to have it explained to you to figure out what it was about, which
    misses the point rather."

    description of it. Even knowing the meaning I still find it hard to see a student
    breaking out.

  body: "Maybe I was a little unclear ealier. It's not supposed to directly depict
    a srudent or a school f\xF6r that matter. An outside person looking at it is not
    suppose to get the idea of a school and student in their mind just the breaking
    free/evolving part.\r\n\r\nThis logo will only be seen by three types of people,
    students, their mentors and the person that the students are doing their practical
    training for. So for them the student and school part are already present in their
    mind when they come in contact with this logo.\r\n\r\nGoing to do some revisions
    as soon as i get feedback from the client. I think that having the type on the
    side next to the icon would work better. I'm also going to try to find another
    font, have been looking for a while but haven't founf anything that seems to fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    They didn't like this version they liked the old suggestions better. I'm gonna
    have to come up with something else.

  body: I like the very last mark best, but the logotype doesn't work with it for
    me.  I think the all-caps or title case is a better approach, and the italic just
    seems a bit crushed but the bold, exploding M.  (By the way - I read the "M" as
    bursting, not as being a diamond - but I still like it.)

    like the points are stabbing into the student although I do like this better.
    But I believe in alpha-glyphs above all so I like the supporting "M"

  body: "Thanks,\r\n\r\n:D I was hoping no one would notice the macdonalds fries thing.
    I was worried about that but the client didn't react on it.\r\n\r\nThis logo will
    only be viewd on a website, fairly small. This is what I'm thinking about doing,
    removing one or two triangles and moving them down so that they don't \"explode\".
    Now the concept is leaning more towards that the student is the jewel in the project
    with the \"M\" as the mentor supporting it. Which I think works better then the
    exploding/evolving concept. Also I'm hoping this will reduce the fries problem.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the colors I have a color scheme which I have to follow. The orange and dark
    purple are two of the colors. Might adjust the gradient some still.\r\n\r\nWill
    post more updates soon, thanks for the feedback so far.\r\npeter"
