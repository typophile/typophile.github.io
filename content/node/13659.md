body: "The Typographic Circle was formed about thirty years ago by a group of advertising
  typographers as the Type Directors Club (UK), to bring together anyone with an interest
  in type.\r\n\r\nThe Circle depends on membership revenue to be able to continue
  with its programme of high calibre speakers, studio visits and organizing social
  events. Membership to the Typographic Circle is open to anyone with an interest
  in typography and there are certainly no admittance tests.\r\n\r\nPrevious events
  have included [[House Industries]], [[Gerard Unger]], [[Brian Webb]], Andy Altman,
  NB Studio.\r\n\r\nTo be a member of the Typo Circle has some tangible benefits.
  You will receive priority booking and reduced entry to events and lectures by the
  Typo Circle, and receive our publication, [[Circular]], for free. Furthermore, we
  have arranged a discount scheme on books published by Rotovision. You will also
  receive free membership to Fontzone and be able to purchase [[Dalton Maag]] Exclusive
  fonts at a discount of 20%.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typocircle.co.uk/"
