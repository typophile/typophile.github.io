body: "I am curious to find if there is a style available for Photoshop\r\nthat allows
  a blank colored layer to be 'erased' by type to reveal (eg. a photo in this case)
  layer underneath?\r\n\r\nI did a quick example but I had to merge the text and blank
  layer together then magic wand the black text and delete, leaving rough edges so
  it then had to be blurred.\r\n\r\nAny input would be helpful!\r\n\r\n"

    effect. You have to either rasterise the text or just select it (CMD/Strg + Click
    on the text layer), then create a mask on a coloured layer."

  body: "I might not be understanding what you're trying to do, but if you want text
    filled with a photo over a background, you can keep the text editable by making
    the text into a mask layer, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_2_4421.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    key is to option-click on the line dividing the text from the photo. That'll indent
    the photo (Layer 3) and mask it to the text.\r\n\r\nI probably have my terminology
    wrong.\r\n"
