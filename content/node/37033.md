  pairs in a font (not all), e.g. in the Kerning Table, so that you could then modify
  them using the Adjust metrics command? I'm running FontLab Studio 5.0.4 on Mac OS
  10.4.10.\r\n\r\nSorry if this has already been addressed; my search of Typophile
  wasn't so thorough.\r\n\r\nOlli"

    changes via scripting.

    was sort of aware of this possibility; I just didn't want to go there unless I
    needed to. I have used AFM files with Fontographer, but not yet with FL. (Scripting
    is beyond my currect skills.)\r\n\r\nThanks, Miguel!\r\n\r\nOlli"
