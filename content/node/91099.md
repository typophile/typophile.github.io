body: "(I ran a search but didn\u2019t find anything. If it has been covered, apologies
  in advance, please direct me to the relevant thread and ditch this one.)\r\n\r\nNot
  sure I sufficiently summed up my question in the subject line...\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  been noodling around with type for a long time. Took a long break. Now I\u2019m
  getting back into it again.\r\n\r\nI have no interest in selling my type commercially
  - as if it\u2019s even good enough. I just want to use it in my own work, and hopefully
  it\u2019s something of a selling point if I look for a job with someone. Unique
  type that no one else has. I figure it has more worth that way.\r\n\r\nNow if I
  work at an agency/studio/etc., I don't mind loading them on the computers to use
  in projects, but when I go, I want to take them off the computers. I thought of
  a legal document to state that up front. That when I go, my typefaces remain my
  intellectual property, and you can no longer use them. \r\n\r\nAm I nuts for even
  thinking this? Would a potential employer laugh at me and tell me to run along?
  Would a lawyer tell me I have no legal basis? Does such a document exist? Or should
  I just be  nice guy, leave them on the computer and quite possibly find them being
  disseminated on bit torrent sites in the future?"

    for their client work, but not for projects where you weren\u2019t the designer.
    Is it realistic to expect that you are the only designer to work on a given client?
    What if you are sick or on vacation, or have moved on?\r\n\r\nBut you might have
    difficulties if you created an identity or campaign, and your employer\u2019s
    client needed to do some work using it, in house, and would be unable to licence
    the fonts commercially to do that."

  body: "As Nick said, you could create a license. But I doubt if any agency would
    agree to such a license, for the reasons that he mentioned.\r\n\r\nEven if you're
    the only designer assigned to a project, it's still the agency's client and the
    agency's project, and they will want to have access to the assets used in case
    work needs to be done in your absence. For example, suppose a year after you leave
    the client asks them to update the job?\r\n\r\nProbably best just to use those
    fonts on your freelance projects. \r\n"

  body: "If your fonts aren't good enough to sell commercially, as you say, then you
    shouldn't be using them for professional work. If they are, and you created them
    on your own time, then your employer should license them on the same terms that
    anyone else would.\r\n\r\nIf licensing fonts is your call as a designer, they
    don't even have to know the foundry is you. But if they don't have a budget for
    licensing fonts, then you should take to heart the reality that your job is not
    meant to entail a level of design that transcends choosing from the available
    system/bundled fonts. Your decision of whether to give your work away to impress
    people should probably start with the assumption that you can't take it back later."

    company software they may own the work by default. (Your employment agreement
    might say so explicitly or implicitly.)\r\n\r\nI'm not assuming you are... just
    adding another consideration."

    <em><strong>consider</strong></em> a career\u2014fill- or part-time\u2014in type
    design. If your work\u2019s any good, people will steal it if they can; even if
    your work\u2019s mediocre, people will steal it if they can. Unless you wish to
    produce your work as real-live foundry type\u2014i.e., a real, physical product
    cast in metal, which cannot be emailed or downloaded\u2014people will steal it
    if they can.\r\n\r\nThat's the curse\u2014and the blessing\u2014of digital existence."

    here in the UK, anything you produce as an employee is the property or your employer;
    that's what they are paying you for.\r\n\r\nI think you are correct in your assumption
    that any prospective employer would laugh you out of the interview at your suggestion
    or if they wanted to spare your feelings maybe they might say \"Well keep your
    fonts away from our computers then\".\r\n\r\nIf you are freelance however things
    are open to negotiation I guess; I imagine it depends how much they want your
    work."

    firms I've worked for full-time had in the contract that I was forbidden to do

    remember a fellow designer who would come to work exhausted because he had stayed
    up all night trying to meet his freelance deadlines. Didn't take long for management
    to figure out what was going on, and he got a stern warning to knock off the freelance
    work if he wanted to keep his day job."
