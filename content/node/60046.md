  the nEwsletter!\r\nPlease scoot on over to http://slowprint.com and click on the
  'sign-up' link!\r\nThis issue discusses the production of some recent work, updates
  to the SlowPrint Studio toy box, and gives a short opinion on the web fonts discussion
  (well, not like you haven't heard enough about that ;-)\r\n\r\nSlow Print Studio
  (nee Exquisite Letterpress) is a typographic letterpress shop, dedicated to the
  finest possible impression of the typographic letter. We're completely digital,
  but also hand-tune every PDF* for perfect letterpress reproduction, adding stroke
  weight to glyphs, adjusting spacing of mouse-type, etc. *(in consultation with the
  designer of course!)\r\n\r\nThanks for great designs, comments and ideas from Typophilistas!
  \r\nKeep them coming!\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n\r\n"
