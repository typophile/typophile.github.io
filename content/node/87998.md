  concept for a Jazz pianist. Originally I thought the broken 'a' was clever, but
  now having second thoughts. Also finding it difficult to balance with typeface on
  the cover of the CD packaging (Der\xE9on from Typofonderie). Seems most acceptable
  at larger sizes, less so at smaller sizes. Your comments welcome."

    for peer review. If you don\u2019t have anything constructive to say, just say
    \u201Cstart again from scratch\u201D.\r\nAdding some reasoning would be nice too.\r\nTo
    me, for example, the type used don\u2019t say \u201Cpianist\u201D at all: too
    bold and techno."

    need a different look to match Dereon.

  body: "I have to agree with the others, I think you need to take a step back, look
    at the subject, the market for the genre, then start. It is easy to 'finish' a
    project by doing something that may suit ourselves, but at the end of the day
    this cd cover has a number of jobs, yours is at the bottom of the list. It has
    to represent, the artist, and how he perceives himself and the market perceives
    him, it has to immediately hit a wavelength with those who will buy into his music,
    it has to give some indication or feel for the content of the cd. \r\n\r\nThe
    definition of an appropriate font(s) is only part of he design process, and I
    know this is what Andreas was try to say, think about it there is more that needs
    to be addressed here than the font.\r\n\r\nPostitive input, start with the image,
    this is a jazz musicians cd cover it should reek style and attitude - this is
    jazz, this is not Bing Crosby's xmas cd. Get a great image with some attitude
    and style, the client playing the piano at a gig with stage lighting would be
    a good start. Make sure you image has plenty of space around it, the current image
    is shoe horned into the frame, and too 'in your face'. get rid of the cheesy smile.
    Then you can have a look at the type. You have two lines of type, the artists
    name, and the name of the album. If the artist is well known and the pending release
    has been well covered in the media, you can focus on the name of the album. If
    he is not well known, you need to focus on his name. The most important line will
    be the display line, the font should be in tune with the music, the font you are
    using at the moment is too childlike, it would be ok if he was sitting at a playdoh
    piano. Make sure the secondary line of type is in tune with the first, whether
    is is stroke weight, same feel, they must be complimentary. In the case of type
    size is important, in the instance of a cd cover it must be big enough to be seen
    when it is on the shelf, but not so big that it makes the album look cheap. Remember
    design is a process, the first step thought, think, what would a jazz fan pick
    up, and second, what will make my client look and feel good."

  body: "sorry mate - can't say i like a thing about the cover... the picture - it's
    cheesy but - if it's the only picture available/in budget it can work with some
    photoshop... throw some colour over the whole picture? and you MUST remove all
    the wiring from the bottom left corner...\r\n\r\nnow to the typography - what's
    up with the 2 different Fs?\r\n\r\nthe \"broken\" font seems something more suited
    to a rock band stencilling onto a flight case rather than a refined gentleman's
    jazz album. there too is no refinement in the colours of the cover or the size
    of the name... or the relationship between the typograpghy and the photo. \r\n\r\nthe
    photo suggests this is a chance for you to get to know the artist up close and
    personal - i'd suggest handwritten typography throughout the booklet to suit.\r\n\r\nthe
    title of the album just doesn't fit there. the text fouls his shoulder, and in
    a case of \"less is more\" there are several ideas going on in the title... i
    like the text behind the picture effect but it doesn't work here either - the
    mic stand is too thin and the H is simply cut in half. there's a mustard coloured
    slug and the text changes colour for no apparent reason. all this happening on
    a busy picture with lots of background detail.\r\n\r\ni'd also encourage you to
    check your dimensions - on my screen it doesn't look square.\r\n\r\nhaving seen
    his piano art covered cd - i reckon you are way off the mark with this one.\r\n\r\nkeep
    working on it - keep simplifying it... someone flipping through cds in a store
    has only a second or two to read, recognise and make a decision to stop before
    flipping on to the next disc."
