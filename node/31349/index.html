  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It begins without a sample of work. As I haven&rsquo;t started it yet.</p>
<p>I have however, downloaded a full copy of Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, which I plan on basing the revival/inspiration on. This book is seriously beautiful and I think this is as good as any as a starting point.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to get through the completion of a serif face of my own design. So, to prove to myself that I can actually do it, I&rsquo;m beginning from a historical model.</p>
<p>Since the Aldus/Griffo types were poorly &ldquo;revived&rdquo; in the early 20th century with Monotype&rsquo;s muddy Poliphilus, I figure there could stand to be a clean copy out there that is not Bembo.</p>
<p>My goals for the face will be as follows (critiques of any part of this are welcomed!):</p>
<ol>
<li>The face should be suitable for book text.</li>
<li>The face will follow the work of Griffo as closely as possible from the printed samples available without being too literal. (Are there surviving examples of the actual type used? Are they accessible? What other sources should I be looking into?)</li>
<li>The family will include at least the following: Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, and possibly small caps and lining figures etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, let me know what you think of all of this. Please pardon the thinking out loud.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to dissuade you but this is an old road well traveled.</p>
<p>To my knowledge no punches or matrices exist. There are several good collections of the Aldine printed work (UCLA has a great collection) that would provide better information than a download. Even then, however, the problem is, you can&rsquo;t actually trust (in terms of authenticity) what you are seeing. See my post at</p>
<p><a href="http://BielerPressii.blogspot.com">http://BielerPressii.blogspot.com</a></p>
<p>I did a four-year project concerning the Aldine materials at UCLA. Quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t think it possible to get a true representation of an Aldine face.</p>

<p>I agree that it is not possible to perfectly replicate Aldine forms using printed samples. And definitely not by averaging with software, because you&rsquo;re averaging a source form that is not accurate.</p>
<p>My version would be more inspiration than revival in the end. I plan on using the samples I have as a sort of framework to base my own original forms on.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This sounds like a great project!</p>
<p>In your last sample above, I think that you should revisit the angle of the strokes of the letters. They seem to be more modern (Bodoni-esque… I know, that is over doing it, but follow along…) than old-style.</p>
<p>For example, the bowl of the P should begin to curve downward before it does in your sample. And the top of the O (12 o&rsquo;clock) should be much thicker, as should 1 o&rsquo;clock, while your 10 o&rsquo;clock should be thinner. In other words, you need to rotate the angle of the stress a bit to the left around the &ldquo;circle&rdquo; as a whole (of course an O is not a circle, but I don&rsquo;t know what else to call it).</p>
<p>Also, your serifs appear to be flat-bottomed. I think they should curve, somehow.</p>
<p>I love your L. But could the top serifs, or at least the top right serif, be chunkier?</p>
<p>The pen, the pen! You must remember the pen! (Insert best-possible Yoda voice impression here…)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan,
You&rsquo;re right. Before I get too far I should work some more human elements into the serif forms. I think they are too &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; looking as they stand now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about curving the serifs. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do both types and get someone to do a letterpress print test to see which I like better. It would be fun to vary the amount of ink to see how that would affect the overall look.</p>
<p>I should probably focus on the font looking good on a laser printer though, as that&rsquo;s probably how it will get printed most of the time.</p>
<p>Regards,
Matt</p>

<p>Very nice. I think, as Dan suggests, the dip in the serifs would help with the authenticity. If that is of concern.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m fully understanding your question&hellip;</p>
<p>I have been studying the images I found of the book closely.
Once I find a few good examples of a letter, I compare them and work out the proportions. There is definitely some guessing and some of my own flavor going into the design. It helps me a lot to have a model to begin with.</p>

<p>How very interesting. Could Griffo have so consciously been going against so-called &ldquo;ductal logic&rdquo;? That would be awesome, and a testament to his power as a designer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could this have been a layout error or what?</p>

<p>Extremely unlikely to be a compositing error.
And almost as unlikely to be a casting error.</p>
<p>Definitely, absolutely, totally keep it. It would be such a statement. Certain people will sputter in outrage that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s backwards&rdquo;, at which point the historical precedent (which happens to be the sort of thing they [also] worship) would be a dramatic and much-needed slap in the face.</p>

<p>The interesting question is why would Griffo do it? The only clue, and arguably a tenuous one, I can think of is that &ldquo;X&rdquo; is almost never the first letter of a word, plus the tops of glyphs carry more visual weight, plus the &ldquo;X&rdquo; (and notably not the &ldquo;x&rdquo;, which does maintain conventional contrast distribution) has a lateral spacing &ldquo;issue&rdquo;.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi again.
I would really like to get some more feedback on the actual letterforms and other details of this work in progress. Here is a new specimen page to look at, this time including lowercase:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.madtype.net/pdf/aldine__text_test_02_16_2007.pdf">http://www.madtype.net/pdf/aldine__text_test_02_16_2007.pdf</a> (pdf 230k)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d especially like to hear from you, Gerald, as you have been immersed in the Aldine materials.</p>
<p>Features of the final fonts will be:</p>
<p>• Alternate brackets and parens that align with the uppercase in addition to the standard glyphs that align with the lowercase.
• Lots of ligatures (ff, fi, fj, fl, ffi, ffl, ct, st, etc.)
• Ending swash glyphs for &ldquo;e&rdquo; &ldquo;m&rdquo; &ldquo;n&rdquo; etc.
• Small caps included in each font.
• Both lining and old style figures included.</p>
<p>Once I get this regular weight completely locked in, I will then work on the bolds and italics.</p>
<p>I have to say that I am happy with how the font is looking when printed out. It&rsquo;s feeling more heavy duty to me than Bembo, which was my original goal.</p>

<p>The version I read is only that he was accused, and it is not known what happened to him&ndash;whether he was convicted and hung or eg. let go on grounds of self-defense. Also there is a version with the son in law and a version with the brother in law.</p>
<p>In general Griffo modified the handwritten ductus for more even color. This was his breakthrough, ever since imitated. Still the letters retain the &lsquo;underlying force&rsquo; of the hand written models, as that was their point of departure.</p>

Not many have written about how Griffo died (for reasons of decorum as

But of those sources who talk about his death I don&rsquo;t recall any that claim
anything besides hanging (for some in-law).</p>

<p>I believe often we see what we want to see. People see ductus in my own

<p>Certainly Jenson was an important precurssor, but it was more fully executed with Griffo</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I am guessing it was a mistake in casting, so the type was upside down. Checking on the samples from &lsquo;Seneca&rsquo; (with Griffo type) in Peter Burnhill&rsquo;s &lsquo;Type Spaces&rsquo;, the Xs don&rsquo;t seem to have reversed contrast. Though it admittedly is hard to tell exactly what is going on because the ink spread is so extreme. Also the fact that the lower case X&rsquo;s in Matt&rsquo;s sample are normal stress would tend to bolster the idea that it was a casting or trimming mistake. It could be part of his general effort to rebalance the color of the alphabet, but as I say I doubt it.</p>

<p>For that to be plausible the descender space needs to be equal to the ascender space, otherwise the &ldquo;X&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t sit on the baseline. Is this the case?

<p>By my lights, I am not a conservative, either in type or politics, but a reformist. Reformism, as formulated by my late teacher Karl Popper, is the idea that we appreciate tradition as a source of strength, but criticise it, and make reforms to change and improve it where we find it lacking.</p>
<p>Thus in type revival I do not believe that literal, &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; revivals are worth the effort. But I do think that making &lsquo;contemporary classics&rsquo; is worth the effort. Here I would include such faces as Slimbach&rsquo;s Garamonds and Carter&rsquo;s Miller.</p>

<p>No, it is not a question of less or more, it is a question of changing tradition critically, rather then knee jerk change or persistence. In some areas I find more wrong with tradition than others do, in some places less.</p>
<p>I find both conservatives and radicals annoying because they know the solution before they hear the problem. Change for a good reason, not because of a general rule.</p>
<p>Like you, I am interested in readability in text type. So I would say, there are good reasons to forget about reviving Bodoni as a text type, but to go for reviving  Griffo&rsquo;s types for text.</p>

<p>My views don&rsquo;t fit into your boxes, so how about expanding your boxes?</p>
<p>On the possibility of getting it upside down: My understanding is that punches were struck into a copper strip, then a rectangle was cut around the strike, and this fitted into the adjustable mold. The cutting of the copper matrix was a skilled job, as it would also involve fitting. And it was often done by someone other than the punch maker.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d think it would be pretty easy to make a mistake, especially in these very early days of typefounding.</p>

<p>Of course mistakes happen, but then the ink hits the paper and it shows up, right? So is your position that Aldus and Griffo didn&rsquo;t notice the mistake, or didn&rsquo;t care enough to fix it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it was often done by someone other than the punch maker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically the typefounding tasks were split up among different people in the case of large operations. I suspect in the case of the Aldine press Griffo did as much as possible; he most probably was the one striking the punches onto the matrix material, and then why not go ahead and prep the matrix for casting? I can however see the actual casting done by somebody else, for reasons of risk (of burning) and skill-set difference.</p>
<p>Also, they must have had a way of marking orientation; think of the risk of ending up with an upside-down &ldquo;o&rdquo; for example. Admittedly, even with such a marking the matrix could possibly have been placed upside down in the mould; but have you done the ascender/descender-space test I mentioned?</p>

The modulation in all the letters (quite mild), the roughness of them, the small letter size, to my eyes they do not seem to set an entirely systematic approach on how and where &ldquo;apply weight&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think when Griffo worked worried about the result in such a way like most people seem to do now. I think he tried to make the whole work the most functional and aesthetically satisfying, and it was enough good.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Matthew,
This is something crying out to be done; I pray you finish it.</p>
<p>I wanted to do pretty much what you are doing at Reading, but I had to quit through illness; I&rsquo;m sad not to have anything to show for the months spent researching, thinking and working on a variety of averaging procedures, which took me a long way beyond the stuff Bill has kindly pointed you to. Luckily, it seems I you can do the work for me :-)</p>
<p>The tone of what follows is, just for brevity&rsquo;s sake, terribly hectoring; take it with an implied &ldquo;but if you want to go another way by all means do&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gerald is right; but if not a set of fonts you can revive single pages of roman and of italic. Nonetheless your interpretation of what you see needs a thorough knowledge of the mature Griffo&rsquo;s work, in the earliest printings from completed, coherent types. That means using the Scriptores Astronomici Veteres rather than the Hypnerotomachia, for which the type had degraded - degraded further, for the lowercase - and been rather poorly set. It means seeing the De Aetna lowercase, which is a jumble of experimental forms in a very clean state unusually well printed, and comparing it with the revised and narrowed 1499 lowercase; you should also look at the 1497(?) roman, broader, more even, more coherent and less interesting than the 1499, which exists in immaculate form well printed. For your italic, you should see and consider using elements not just, or even mostly, from the well-known 1501 italic in its infinite versions up to 1519, but also the 1503 italic for Soncino and the 1516 made for Griffo&rsquo;s own press, which are generally superior and respectively more beautiful and more functionally intelligent. I&rsquo;ve come to see the titchy 1516er as a masterpiece, and it impressed Gerard Unger, who doesn&rsquo;t like the 1501 or 1503. For all these, you need both higher-res scans than you have for the Hypnerotomachia and actual physical books or pages in front of you. I have scans and leaves of the 1501 in its last (?) 1519 state, British Library scans and one leaf of the 1499 S.A.V., BL scans of the 1503 and the 1516, and photographs of the crappy early Jensonian roman - it&rsquo;s interesting to see where Griffo started from - and the 1497 roman. I will send JPEGs if you like, and in extremis could post you my own pages. Just a glance at these will show that your roman isn&rsquo;t very accurate, is more regular than the original, and follows norms established for new work only in the twentieth century. Again, if that&rsquo;s fine by you, that&rsquo;s fine full stop. What you&rsquo;ve produced so far is absolutely lovely.</p>
<p>You can get much closer, though others will disagree, with averaging, because it retains information that the eye examining a page cannot possibly synthesize. Here is the output of averaging a page of 1503 italic, using my software (I can send it, but Raph has his own which is much less labour-intensive though perhaps - I can&rsquo;t be at all sure - a shade less accurate). The only processing it has had is increasing contrast to full range and giving it a white background.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beach pond_5374.PNG]
Unsharp masking - which is crucial - shows clearly that there are two &lsquo;c&rsquo;s here (but not, for instance, two &lsquo;n&rsquo;s):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beach pond unsharp_4167.PNG]
Now the 1499 roman, from my own page, unprocessed:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adhesion unprocessed_4689.PNG]
See the slight whitening on the top of &lsquo;o&rsquo;, or the baseline serif of &lsquo;i&rsquo;?
Exaggeratedly unsharped and contrast increased for obviousness:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adhesion_4758.png]
The different texture of, for instance, &lsquo;h&rsquo; vs &lsquo;i&rsquo; comes from having fewer (too few) images of &lsquo;h&rsquo; being averaged.
If you extract only the interiors, you get
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adhesion metal_4387.png]
Is that metal? Well, since it&rsquo;s produced from the exaggerated version, and the &lsquo;n&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t clearly join, it must be a pixel or two skinnier than the metal; but it&rsquo;s surprisingly clean for a type often thought of as very rough.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Griffo fans!</p>
<p>very interesting work and discussion in progress. I am impressed as I usally am by the expert knowledge that one finds in this forum. Although the fun is reduced a lot after the pages redesign for it seems to me awfully slow now. That&rsquo;s kind of fun killer.
I am personally not a big Griffo fan for I always found Jensons characters more beautiful and even in the text. What was seen in Aldus printings as a progress i.e. the narrower character ruined the genious idea of having circles as basic idea for beauty. And not the circle of inner forms or else but as a whole as drawn from a pen. Jensons letters to my eyes are the more important ones to take as an example for learning about beauty. I am sorry its provoking from my side, maybe I am only frustrated of not getting response from fantastic guys as Raph, Hrant or William&hellip;</p>
<p>Matthew your pdf was impressing. I particularly liked the way you treated the &lsquo;h&rsquo; here your face is soft and pen like as it should be. Maybe you can invest some time in the &lsquo;a&rsquo; if you want. I attach a beautiful redesign from Malin and a rough sketch in Photoshop</p>
<p>best wishes
Stefan (Centaur fan ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Both styles are very viable, both originally and in revival, so I don&rsquo;t have a strong opinion about this.</p>
<p>However, I do feel is that Griffo did make something of an advance over Jenson in making metal type more fully &lsquo;typographic&rsquo;, which is to say more &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; by making the color more even, and the characters less calligraphic, and more restrained. The horizontal e is part of this.</p>
<p>Jenson is also great, but my feeling is that for small 12 pt and lower sizes the model set by Griffo may have an edge.</p>
<p>For example, Centaur is a more beautiful type than Monotype Bembo, but it doesn&rsquo;t work at small sizes, as far as I have seen. There have been a number of recent revivals or Jenson-influenced type, and maybe if I studied them I might change my mind.</p>

<p>Hey! In fact I have great difficulties in finding the discussions in progress since the redesign. How is it possible to get a quick link to the discussions one has last made a response or anything. The search modus works very slow and I do not manage to find actual replies very easy. Its hard work for my patience ;-) 
hrant, I didn&rsquo;t expect any precise response just have to get used that maybe some topics come to an end while others go on or start from new. I am a beginner with forum, guess I have to learn a lot.</p>
<p>I wanted to attach another secret for me in letter design ;-)</p>
<p>Nice to hear from you anyhow.
hrant what is your baskerville revival doing or wasn’t it you?
I sent to you something - not much  maybe it didn’t arrive</p>
<p>so long
hope I will get better in using this forum</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi William,</p>
<p>you are right anyhow what concerns Centaur for example in small sizes. Depends also a lot yet on the lack of ink means blackness specially in the smaller sizes. The Valdonega interpretation of Centaur has a beautiful 8 point size!! (even smaller than we are used to 8 point!) Heavy enough it is very readable and if use it as a footnote the colour of 12, 16 and 8 point perfectly match. If you close the eyes a little a page set in various size has the same colour density feeling! It is possible.
Ok, Adobe made some progresses in that direction but why are there forms always so rounded and weaky?
Look at Adobe Jensons g, its far to round, to nervous in its counterforms, doesn’t work like a real Jenson.</p>
