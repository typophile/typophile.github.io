  body: 'Question #1: <BR>My favorite Linotype font of 2004 is the Adrian Frutiger/Akira
    Kobayashi masterful renovation and extension of Avenir, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html"
    target="_blank">Avenir Next</a> &#40;OpenType&#41;. <BR> <BR>My favorite non-Linotype
    font of 2004 is Lineto&#39;s <a href="http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/"
    target="_blank">Akkurat</a>, designed by Laurenz Brunner. <BR> <BR>My favorite
    type design project of the year, was one of my own. I designed a little thin sans
    serif italic called Farewell, and then handlettered a large piece that was briefly
    exhibited in the Klingspor Museum. <BR><a href="http://www.typeoff.de/english/html/artikel/k_f_o_b_writeup.html"

    <BR> <BR>Question #2: <BR>I don&#39;t know what the most popular font of the year
    was. Best sellers at Linotype were Neue Helvetica, Frutiger, and Linotype Univers.
    At MyFonts, Zapfino did really well, and so did Helvetica. I think that Helvetica
    Neue and Adobe Garamond are pobably the most popular fonts every year, in one
    sad sense'

    Illinois, and I was surprised how often I saw it in use, especially for local
    band gig posters.

  body: No favs to list, but this last year I have been seeing of all things Papyrus.
    I see it on signage, eatery logos, display lettering and on packages for consumer
    goods. <BR> <BR>It drives me crazy. Just when I think its use has been stretched
    to the limits I find it in some new and sadly unique application. <BR> <BR>I have
    come to loathe the font to such a degree that it has become a joke around our
    studio. <BR> <BR>Mike

    actually looked at it at MyFonts a week ago and then I saw it again this morning
    in the MyFonts newsletter.  If I win that prize, I&#39;ll definately buy a weight
    of Variable.

    <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a show on TV I was subjected to last night called &#39;Wickely
    Perfect&#39; or something. It&#39;s a &#34;who&#39;s America&#39;s next Martha
    Stewart?&#34; show. Anyway, all of the on-screen labels...Papyrus.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I see that on your site you have the whole family
    for $99, while on MyFonts they&#39;re $39 each for 5 weights with no option for
    buying the whole family, unless I&#39;m mistaken.  The typeface is really nice;
    I hope I&#39;ll get a cool project down the road so I could purchase the font&#40;s&#41;...

  body: Lauri, <BR>You have to click on &#34;purchase options&#34; on any of the weights
    of Variable to get the family purchase option. This is one of the features I think
    could be improved on Myfonts.com. It is a little hidden.

    saw a crap-load of Benguiat last year too, a font I like a lot, but the poor thing
    was quite abused in most cases.
