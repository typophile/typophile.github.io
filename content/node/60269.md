    tactile 'image' - one you enjoy and experience by touching it.\r\nI am pactiularly
    thinking of the effect you get when touching the kenya hara juice cartons.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "Rather than stressing the \"enjoy and experience\" aspect, I think you should
    aim towards utility. I suspect the blind would prefer something that is quick
    and easy to use.\r\n\r\nAlso, define calendar. Today it can be a list of days,
    weeks, and months, or something that one puts appoints into (Outlook Calendar).\r\n\r\nMight
    as well define blind as well, since there are the totally blind, and those who
    have limited vision, yet are legally blind."

  body: "Thank you Will and Don.Even i thought of Utility for blind.But i dont want
    to work only with braille.coz many people would have done it before.Since this
    is my thesis project..i wish to do something completely different.\r\nHow bout
    constructing 3d shapes.and top of that mayb dates n months with braille.\r\nI
    am still thinking over it.\r\nAny suggestions are most welcome"

    design experience for The Blind\"\r\nUnder this i am explaining about various
    tools any designer can use while working with blind.\r\nLike sound smell airflow
    temperature to help blind navigate in any space.\r\nCalendar and invitation design
    for blind is a part of this project.\r\nIts challenging for me because there are
    no refrences anywhr."

  body: "Sorry, i figured it would be a braille calendar and you were just wanting
    to make it a bit more interesting.\r\nWith the new explanation i would try and
    find a method of representing the calendar which is primarily physical and move
    away from alll letterforms (both coventional and braille) completely.\r\nHow about
    starting by looking at aztec or egyptian systems, or by looking at planetary positions.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "For an invitation, in a context involving the <em>visually impaired</em>
    (you may wish want to consider that nomenclature if you already haven't), I would
    start playing with giant embossed type, with black ink printed and registered
    on top of the embossment. I'd want to see it from 100 feet away and feel it with
    my eyes closed.\r\n\r\nOld fashioned eye charts might be a reference, and there's

    hear and feel that "texture", not physically.

  body: "I watched my mother-in-law sign for many decades and ultimately had to teach
    our third child sign language as he did not speak until almost 4... nothing mind
    you except mama and dada and about 5 other words. \r\n\r\nMet a fellow (who was
    blind) when I was an art director, back in the early '90's, and we hit it off.
    My father was basically blind in one eye as a result of an eye injury in the war
    so I had a teeny bit of sensibilty about this dilemma. To this day my eyes are
    so empathetic that if some ones tears up I am a goner. After a couple of weeks
    of talk I asked my friend what he felt he missed in the seeing world. To my surprise
    he said \"NOTHING.\" He loved textures, things he could feel, touch and smell.
    Well that was all I needed. I started bring him things that I found interesting
    to touch and smell. He said the nastiest thing was a wet spent Hibiscus blossom,
    the best smell was a Gardenia bloom and his girlfriends body was the best sensation
    in the world. \r\n\r\nThanks for dredging up that friendship, he has since passed
    away.\r\n\r\nTexture and odor might be the way to go. \r\n\r\nIt's odd now that
    I have typed this I remember I did a cover and inside lettering for a book by
    Random House called \"The Stinky Book.\" Loaded with scratch and sniff.......
    what fun : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Thank u micheal for sharing your wonderful thoughts,.\r\nIts amazing how
    blind enjoy their own world with their other senses.They probably dont know what
    they are missing..coz they are not aware of such things..\r\n\r\nMany people feel
    sympathy for blind..but that attitute is very very wrong.Blind doesnt need any
    sympathy..all they need is education and inspiration to go forward in life.\r\n\r\nHere
    I am designing a manual which will have guidelines as how a blind can visit a
    museum or any space for that matter.I hope il be able to finish it successfully!!"

  body: I think smell, sound and touch might be a little off topic for typophile.
    Try contacting an organization like [[http://www.nabdelhi.org/|The National Association
    for the Blind-Delhi]]. Learning good research skills is an important part of large
    projects in both academia and corporate culture.

    people don't have different emotions to sighted people...think about what sounds
    and smells make *you* happy. "

    are not totally without sight \u2013 so you should include some visual element.
    \r\n\r\nIf you are going to have sound, you could also look at a recording/playing
    device that could at the touch of a button read appointments for the day.\r\n\r\nTim"
