    consider (the look reminds of the article about the font for Mexico '70 in <em>dotdotdot</em>).\r\n\r\nYou
    could try <a/href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/mondosearchresults.htm?st=12&kid=ITC%20Bauhaus\">ITC
    Bauhaus</a> in the lighter weights; Blippo and Churchward also carry similar characteristics,
    but I don't know if they are digital fonts these days."
