    Don\u2019t bother looking for other reasons to upgrade, because there aren\u2019t

  body: Yeah, text features in Flash CS3 are still so 90's. Text engine is such a
    pain in the ass and I hate the lack of OT support. You can't even manually insert
    common ligatures from Adobe's own Pro fonts.

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis discussion started a few years ago but it seems the problem
    is still a valid one. I am working on a MAC and experiencing problems with CS4
    displaying the extended latin characters of Aller typeface. It is a free font
    and although it says its a True Type font, FontExplorer says its an Open Type
    font. Did anyone find a solution to this problem?"

    about the problems you are having with this font in Flash CS4. "
