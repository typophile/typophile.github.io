  body: I think any reputable jeweler can do it or knows someone who can. <BR> <BR>Sometimes
    the typefaces are limited -- I had a choice of two when I got my wedding ring
    engraved.

  body: I know, no one is going to say yes to that question. But let me put it out.
    <BR> <BR>Have Jim Rimmer cut punches. Or one punch with all the characters. Drive
    it into the material before the ring is made.

    your hands.

  body: Once, while travelling, I chanced upon a jewelry artist who was designing
    what seemed to be innocuous silver bands, but inside were complete alphabets and/or
    phrases. I&#39;ve always been intrigued ever since, and would love to find if
    anyone&#39;s doing it. The typical &#34;engraved&#34; option doesn&#39;t appeal,
    mostly due to lack of choice in style and size. The rings I saw, the cap-height
    of the letters took up the entire width of the ring. <BR> <BR>and no, this is
    not a lord of the rings thing. Yes, I saw the movie. No, I&#39;m not a huge Tolkien
    fan. Typophile, yes. guilty as charged. <BR>

  body: I had a friend -- a poet -- who had the alphabet tattooed around her ankle.
    I always coveted that. Maybe you could skip the ring and just have the words tattooed
    around your finger. I mean after all, if you were <i>really</i> committed to type....  <BR>;&#41;

  body: Ok not really engraved but enamel text on rings by a british jeweller <a href="http://www.solangeazagurypartridge.com"
    target="_blank"> Solange Azagury Partridge </a>, you have to dig a bit through
    the site, but in the Collection on the left, look for the &#39;Vices and Virtues&#39;
    ring, there is also a &#39;7 days of the week&#39; ring. One has to chuckle at
    a collection that has a &#39;F&#42;&#42;k Off&#39; bracelet made from emeralds
    and jet.

  body: You could try Mottl Industry. They make the RISD class rings, which have type
    on all four surfaces &#40;including an optional script on the inside, whose height
    doesn&#39;t fill the whole ring width&#41;. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.risdring.com"
