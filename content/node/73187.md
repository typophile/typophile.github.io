  body: "I think this resembles <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/binary-light/\">ITC
    Binary</a> more than anything else I could find, but I believe it is custom lettering.
    (And rather nice, in my opinion.) It seems to have a tiny \"TM\" following it,
    and very often that means the lettering as well as the name are trademarks. At
    least that's how I have interpreted that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
