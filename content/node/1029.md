body: Just interested in what methods people employ when creating their typefaces.
  <BR> <BR>ie. whether you draw the characters up on paper then scan them in and trace
  them in illustrator/freehand, or draw them straight on the computer, or a combination
  of these 2 methods. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m just interested because sometimes you draw
  a typeface up on paper and it looks good, then you try and recreate it digitally
  using your sketches for reference and it doesn&#39;t seem to look quite right. <BR>
  <BR>thanks <BR>iota.

    and use the divisions for stroke weight. I then devise a grid on the machine and
    translate the design from paper to screen. It then takes ages to make it &#39;look
    right&#39;, because paper is inherently different to the pixel. '

  body: yeh thats basically the way i work too kris. although most of the typefaces
    i&#39;ve worked on recently have been geometric display faces so the translation
    from paper to computer has been quite easy. although i&#39;d imagine if you were
    designing a serif typeface for body copy it would be worth drawing all the letters
    on paper, scanning them in and tracing them on the computer. <BR> <BR>thanks hrant
    i&#39;ll have a look around.
