body: hi -- anything come to mind for a font that could work for Racing cars? i have
  been searching for days, nothing really popping out. the main letter is "S" so something
  with a curvy quality but bad a**!  thanks in advance for any suggestions! :)

    stressed, somehow and somewhat unquiet, unpeaceful,... as if saying \"Get out
    of my way!\" Not bad for a racing car! Still not convinced? Then look at the italic
    capitals K, R , X,....!\r\n\r\nStill not sold? Then wait for suggestions from
    the experts!"

    idea of suggesting this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/eskapade/fraktur-italic/\r\n\r\nOr
    what about this?\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour-latin.gif\r\nAlthough
    you'd want the Bold.\r\n\r\nOr: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/klute/\r\n\r\nBut
    I'm sure better suggestions are on their way.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I\u2019d love to see it in action. If I\u2019m not mistaken, it is mandatory that
    every city in the world have at least one courier service which uses this typeface

    that in their font choices:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/car_logos_5136.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    most real race cars are covered with sponsor logos:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/car-logos_3548.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    know this info isn't particularly helpful to you, but just thought I'd point it
    out. \r\n\r\nA few weeks ago I took my nephew to a monster truck show and many
    of those actually had more dramatic (but mostly juvenile) use of graphics and
    fonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/truck2_6553.jpg]"
