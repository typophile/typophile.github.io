body: "Hello and Happy Holidays!\r\n\r\nI have been toying with the idea of going
  into business for myself as a commercial letterist for some time. I still have yet
  to make a brochure, business cards, ect. Here are some samples that I was going
  to put in my brochure. I thought i would share them with anyone who likes lettering
  as much as I do. :)\r\n\r\nHappy New Year!\r\n\r\n-Charles Borges de Oliveira"
