  Is This Trip Really Necessary?</a>\r\n\r\nVery nice perspective.\r\nThis is a topic
  I wrestle with a lot; sometimes it seems I spend more time working on a font\u2019s
  ligatures than drawing the rest of the alphabet!"

    by many purchasers, even though I usually use contextual alternates to solve ligature
    problems.\r\nI must admit that I also often include whimsical ligatures for the
    fun of it--usually discretionary."

    Ah. According to the article, apparently not, at least, not any longer, unlike
    the case with metal type."

    on the rest of the alphabet, I think you need to have a discussion with your Mum

  body: "Most graphic designers would agree with Fred Goudy that letterspacing is
    wack.\r\nBut turn a blind eye to its use in justi\uFB01cation.\r\nTolbert Lanston
    initially invented a method of justi\uFB01cation by letterspacing, for the Monotype,
    but the look of it was rejected by typographers.\r\nHowever, when Quark and InDesign
    introduced justi\uFB01cation with letterspacing in the default, there was no such
    outcry, so we\u2019re stuck with it as a norm.\r\nIt\u2019s especially inappropriate
    for oldstyle revivals, which are the ones that have the fancy ligatures (see sample
    above)."
