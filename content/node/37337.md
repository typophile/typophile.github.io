body: "Hi All\r\n\r\nI have to create from scratch a Unicode windows compatible font
  embedding (predefined) bitmaps. I have been asked to use the BitFonter tool to perform
  this job. As far as I have well understood in the BitFonter user guide, this software
  should be the right one to perform such a job. So, following the User guide advices,
  I have created a brand new font and copied/pasted all my bitmaps in the corresponding
  characters. Then I have saved the result in a \"OpenType SBIT (bitmap)Font (*.ttf)\"
  file. \r\n\r\nBut, if I preview the resulting file using the MS-Windows preview
  (double click on the ttf file from a windows explorer) all the characters are rendered
  win a \".\"\r\n\r\nI have spent a lot of time messing around all the parameters
  related to the font in BitFonter but it drew a blank. Always \".\" are displayed
  !\r\n\r\nI have spent an e-mail to the FontLab support, providing by ttf file and
  they replied that the outline was empty! But I was not intent to create outline
  since I wanted to embed bitmaps.\r\n\r\nI thought if should be a very straightforward
  job but it doesn't look.\r\n\r\nIs there somebody confortable with this tool who
  can advice me?\r\n\r\nThank everybody for your help.\r\n\r\n "

  body: I wonder if that windows font preview can even render bitmaps. I think it
    uses vector rendering. Have you already tried just installing and testing the
    font?

  body: "At least in the testing phase I would include outlines - perhaps some quite
    different from the bitmaps. Might also want to look at Calibri and Cambria in
    Vista which include embedded bitmaps at key sizes - maybe diffing against your
    font. Finally don't forget to turn off ClearType and all antialiasing when testing
    the font. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Keep in mind that since the bitmaps are embedded into the font at a particular
    ppm size, you'll only see your bitmaps when you call that ppm size. \r\nWhen I
    use the MS-Windows preview (Win XP)on a font I have with bitmaps, I can see bitmaps
    at 12ppm in the 3rd section that shows the Ascii characters, at 16ppm for the
    12 point sample, and at 24ppm for the 18 point sample. (Remember that bitmaps
    are embedded at ppm size, and the sizes listed in the preview are point sizes)\r\nIf
    your bitmaps are embedded at another size besides 12,16 or 24, you won't see them
    in the Windows preview.\r\n\r\nYou should install the font in Windows, then try
    to type a few characters in Notepad or Word, using your font. As Si noted, \"don\u2019t
    forget to turn off ClearType and all antialiasing when testing the font\" and
    remember that you're specifying a point size in the app, so you need to spec the
    right point size to hit the ppm size you embedded:\r\n(point size * 96) / 72 =
    \ ppm size used.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Hi All\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your prompt replies!\r\n\r\nHere are my font
    configuration:\r\n  Point size = 11 points\r\n  Pixel size = 15 pixels\r\n\r\n
    \ Resolution = 96x96\r\n\r\nWith these figures, the Windows font preview displays
    only dots, whatever the size is.\r\n\r\nIf I assign this font to a string in WordPad
    for example, only dots are displayed (whatever the size).\r\n\r\nActually, the
    embedded bitmaps fit in a bounding box of 15 pixels height. That's the reason
    why I assigned the Pixel size to 15.\r\n\r\nClearType & Antialiasing are turned
    off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">>Pixel size = 15 pixels<<\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, With bitmaps embedded at
    15ppm, you should not see them in Windows font preview.\r\nIf you've installed
    the font, using Wordpad, calling the correct characters, you should see them at
    11point.\r\n\r\nIf not, then something is probably wrong with your font, but it
    could be lots of things; character encodings, bitmap embeddings, settings, etc.
    Does the font pass Font Validator?\r\n\r\nJason C"
