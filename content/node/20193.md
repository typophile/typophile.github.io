  Premiere Pro, including the hamza and ayn. We are are having the designer draw U-02BE
  and U-02BF for these letters. Should the hamza and ayn have an \"italic\" version?
  In Chicago 15, page 423, the word \"ayn\" is italicized but the half ring is not.
  Is that correct?\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!"

  body: "I don't know this for sure, but I do believe that the reason they have all
    come to look like \"monoline halfrings\" has to do with how they were rendered
    in type from older days -- like the Linotron 202. What we used, unless we though
    about it, were the sorts from the phonetic font -- the half-rings, raised up.
    If we had a good Greek font that matched the text font, we'd sometimes use the
    rough & smooth breath marks. When PostScript fonts came along, I used to modify
    the Galliard quoteleft and quoteright to use to signal the hamza & 'ayn in transliteration.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the \"hamza\" is a glottal stop. IPA allows this to be rendered with the \"raised
    comma,\" a name that goes back to the days of the type case. There was no apostrophe
    in the case, so to set one, you raised a comma. Same is true for what is now called
    \ \"quoteleft\" -- there was no such sort, so you took a comma & turned it over.
    Even today, the term \"turned comma\" continues to be used. From the PHONETIC
    SYMBOL GUIDE (Chicago), p. 217: \"IPA usage: The Arabic character 'ain which represents
    a voiced pharygeal fricative, . . . is generally transliterated by a turned comma.\"
    (I used an ellipses so as to not try I put \"reverse gelded question mark\" in
    this file).\r\n\r\nIf you have an Merriam Webster's Second International, go to
    page 75. You'll see that the Hebrew 'ayin would be transliterated exactly the
    same as the Arabic 'ayn -- just don't make the mistake I once made, & refer to
    it as an 'ayn\" when working on one of Netanyahu's books!\r\n\r\nGood luck"
