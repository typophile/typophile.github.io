  it Lao? or Thai? or \u2026?\r\nIs that style of type widespread and usual for that
  script? \r\n.\r\nNow it\u2019s time to do a Thai-style \u2013 Armenian."

    (I had to cheat and look at Thai alphabet tables as I never managed to learn the
    full alphabet), and I realized just now that this is the Thai name for \u2018Sunsilk\u2019."
