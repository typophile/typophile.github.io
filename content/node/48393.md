  recently did a handful of logos for a local Mexican restaurant. After the logo approval,
  I came back to start work on the menu, in which I may want to use the main font.
  The problem is that I have NO IDEA what the name was, as I did a bunch at one time.
  I have a feeling I got it off DaFont, but it may have been on my comp for a while.
  I've been sitting here scrolling through my 6000 fonts in Suitcase with no luck.
  Does anyone know what font this is?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/paso_3418.jpg]"

    font that someone created. I could probably just redo the general look with Univers,
    but I may be using this font quite a bit.\r\n\r\nI think scrolling through Suitcase
    is making me blind!!"
