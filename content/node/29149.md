  body: "Take classes in formal calligraphy.\r\nFirstly, basic exercises tighten up
    your form and give it a pleasing consistency.\r\nSecondly, the joining rules turn
    writing into an intriguing game, because when it comes to writing an unusual word,
    or one that requires \"notwithstanding\" sub-rules, writing then becomes a process
    where the writer is trying to implement the rules correctly, and this engagement
    can impart an expressive personality to the writing. Or else it turns into a very
    \"proper\" style -- but either way it's an improvement."

    it for some weird reason.\r\nI think maybe the problem is your hand. If you make
    only limited exercise with your hand (like repetitive movements typical of people
    that use computer all day) it tends to get rigid. If your hand is more flexible
    and relaxed it might improve the way you hold your pen and it may reflect on your
    handwriting. Try to play the piano or something. \r\n\r\nTrust me: I'm a doctor."

  body: "Lorenza makes a good point with her second question, somehow the aesthetic
    aspect of an handwriting expresses the relation between what its author innerly
    is and how he/she presents him/her self to others, how he/she would like to be
    treated and considered by them.\r\nThe graphic and plastic expression (a gesture
    is a sign that leaves traces in the memory and the actual sign is the visible
    trace of the gesture and it keeps the energy) is linked\u2014\u2014rather than
    to an aesthetic sensibility\u2014\u2014to a motional-sense form of the knowledge,
    towards the goal of giving a tangible consistence to the development of the inner
    side of man.\r\nWhen the inner wealth, most of all, the creative wealth, goes
    together with an adeguate way of expression, there comes the harmony between the
    ideas and their happening."
