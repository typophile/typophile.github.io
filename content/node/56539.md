  body: 27 fonts with 10 criteria each? That makes for an awfully long survey, don't
    you think? I'm trying to take it now and am getting bored at number 8.

  body: "First, thanks for all your participation and attention. ^^\r\nToday it's
    the first post day and I already got 10 responses.  \r\n\r\nTo cuttlefish, There
    are 24 fonts and 3 more demographic questions. Yes, I know it's a long survey,
    and on average it will take you 30 mins to finish it. I want to make a comprehensive
    study so at last there are 10 attributes of each font... It's really need a little
    patience....\r\n\r\nTo Quincunx, thanks for taking this survey.\r\n\r\nTo aluminum,
    I think it's an interesting topic, because majority of typeface research are concentrated
    on legibilty and readability. Only a handful of studies have looked typography's
    role in the visual communication.\r\n\r\nTo Christopher Dean, thanks for your
    tracking. As for the data collection, for a reliable and valid analysis, the response
    should be the more the better. I think at least I need to get approximately 100
    persons to participate in this survey. And participants will be given 2 weeks
    to complete the survey from now on."

    believe that Dr. Shaikh conducted a couple of studies on font personality, but
    I can\u2019t recall having seen the findings published anywhere. She and Barbara
    Chaparro gave a talk on some of their font personality work at ATypI in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    it may be better to ask how well they can perform a particular role.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hmmm. I thought that \"fearful\" meant that the font was supposed to induce
    that feeling in the viewer. Mostly because I couldn't quite figure out what it
    would mean for the font itself to be fearful.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm almost done the
    survey....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
