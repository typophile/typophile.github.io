  body: Most of the car model identifications are custom designed, and I fear this
    one is no different. Maybe check this list of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/trajan/?&sample_text=VELSATIS&sample_size=48">Trajan
    alternatives</a> for a close match. <a herf="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/penumbra/?&sample_text=VELSATIS&sample_size=48">Penumbra</a>
    is also in the ballpark.
