body: "What is the easiest way to edit a set of metadata in a font? For instance,
  when I look at the information of a font in fontexplorer, the name/copyright/description/etc?
  I want to be able to easily enter data into a font, for my own purposes, such as
  adding the proper designer to a font that linotype/monotype/whoever has graciously
  stripped out.\r\n\r\nI don't want to load Fontlab or anything, I want to be able
  to edit the metadata similarly to how I can edit meta data of MP3 files in iTunes.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    you should be aware that what is presented to you as metadata in font management
    tools is drawn from various places in the font tables. Also note that data in
    some table, including the name table -- which contains most of the data you are
    likely to want to edit --, is likely to have multiple platform encodings and possibly
    language-specific versions. You'll need to identify which to edit in order to
    affect your own system."

    it for a few years, but it used to be a standard tool. For Dan's purposes this
    will probably do the job, and is free.

  body: "That looks pretty sweet. I don't particularly need to edit font names, etc.
    This is very close to what I need. I'll have to do some switcheroo to get it to
    play nice with my Mac, but it can be done.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    AFDKO?

    I was overlooking an excellent opportunity to market font packages by co-branding
    them with entities who have OEM distribution agreements with me.\r\n\r\nIs there
    a batch processing program that would allow me to change copyright information,
    insert or swap out a single glyph, and increment the version number for several
    hundred fonts at a time?"
