  body: James, I presume your new sans will be in OpenType, in which case you can
    offer oldstyle figures, which would strengthen your market appeal enormously,
    since the newest OT version of Trade Gothic, your nearest relative, does not offer
    OSFs as a globally switchable glyph option. Ditto ITC Franklin Gothic. Can we
    persuade you to add OSFs?

  body: "John, OSF are on the long list of things to add. I\u2019m still a little
    unsure how I want to proceed about furthering the design; it may just be a sandbox
    for me to play with multiple masters, OpenType, and so on for a few years until
    I know what I\u2019m doing and the font can be released."
