  body: "It's a very 'Bauhaus-style' design, and you could probably make something
    like  this with the <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts\">House
    Chalet</a> fonts and some time to edit the 1970  and 1980 variants in the New
    York weight.\r\n\r\nIt also resembles some of the strange designs of <a href=\"http://www.philsfonts.com/sresults.html?key=10&dsgnr=Clotilde%20Olyff\">Clotylde
    Olyff</a>, which I always thought looked like something from an IQ test. See especially
    her designs for 2Rebels, for some that remind me of this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    a font constructed to resemble <a href=\"http://www.gov.nu.ca/Nunavut/English/font/\">Inuktitut
    syllabics</a>.\r\n\r\n(It's a really fascinating language to listen to, and it's
    unfortunate that the Inuit Broadcasting Company doesn't have more original programming
    to distribute.)\r\n\r\n(edit: and <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/48\">Tierra</a>
    isn't far away either....)"
