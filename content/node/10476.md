body: 'As I explained earlier on this forum, DTL FontMaster makes use of separate
  files for glyph, naming, encoding and kerning information. Although perhaps relatively
  complex, this system has proven over the years to be extremely versatile. For instance
  renaming a character or changing Unicode information can be applied to a complete
  type library by simply generating the fonts in batch with the newly edited Character
  Layout file &#40;.cha&#41;. For the production of a different code page only another
  UFM file &#40;that contains naming and some parameter settings&#41; and .cha file
  have to be selected. In most cases the kerning for the different scripts is stored
  in a single file. All the files can be simply edited with a text editor.  <BR> <BR>The
  handling of the BE and IK glyph databases has been made more convenient by a number
  of batch functions. It is for instance possible to collect/import glyph data from
  different databases using a command file in DTL Bezier- and IkarusMaster. For generating
  the OpenType features a BE or IK glyph database can be connected through the UFM
  file to a features file. A large range of GSUB features is currently supported.
  When the OpenType font is generated, the glyph set is compared with the listed features
  and all features that are covered by the glyph set will be generated &#40;actually
  the rest will be removed&#41;. There are three conditions: firstly the glyph&#40;s&#41;
  must be in the database, secondly the character&#40;s&#41; must be listed in the
  .cha file and thirdly the character&#40;s&#41; must be listed in the features file.
  Because of the option to batch the OpenType production a newly created entry in
  a feature can be applied to a &#40;unlimited&#41; number of fonts at once. Basically
  we are extending the features file as much as possible but additions can be simply
  made by the user also. Because the &#39;size&#39; &#40;i.e. number of characters&#41;
  in the generated font is controlled by the Character Layout file, this way also
  the output of features can be controlled. <BR> <BR>Because the UFM files are just
  plain text files that are connected by name to the glyph database files, it is very
  easy to copy the files and rename &#40;some of&#41; the entries for instance for
  generating Eastern-European, Cyrillic, Greek, et cetera or for the OpenType production
  &#40;in DataMaster or directly in a text editor&#41;. Some of the changes can be
  done in batch with for instance BBEdit. At DTL we even have &#40;slightly&#41; different
  copies for the production of PS Type 1 for Mac OS and PC because of some of the
  style names &#40;Light, Medium, Heavy, et cetera&#41;. The basic idea behind the
  system is that you fill in the naming once and never have to look at the UFM files
  again. At DTL all different UFM files are placed together with copies of the glyph
  database in different directories for the different code pages and font formats.
  The distribution from the &#39;base&#39; glyph databases to these directories and
  the renaming of the files to match the UFM names, is handled via &#40;simple&#41;
  AppleScripts over here. For every directory a different Character Layout file, that
  contains the mapping info, is used. I have attached a simplified illustration of
  how the stuff is organized at DTL. <BR> <BR>All this makes batch production very
  easy, although sometimes we still have to change some settings for a complete directory
  by hand. For this reason we are currently developing a command file entry in DataMaster,
  which makes it possible to generate all different font formats with all kind of
  code pages at once from one text file. Because we are updating the FM Features file
  constantly, this way it is for instance very easy to re-generate all OpenType fonts
  with the new features enhancements. But sometimes fixes in the Adobe OT FDK make
  it also necessary to re-generate the fonts. The only way to handle this kind of
  problems is to simply re-generate all the OpenType fonts with one mouse-click using
  the updated software &#40;in this case DTL DataMaster 2.1.3, which will become available
  within a few weeks&#41;. <BR> <BR>Sometimes there seems to be some confusion about
  the default em-square for the BE and IK formats. This might be caused by the fact,
  that the FMDemo font that is supplied with FM has an em-square of 15.000 units instead
  of 1000. <BR>The default for the Ikarus system is 15000 for the em-square. Using
  analog material and a digitizer, 1000 IK units correspond with 1 centimeter. At
  DTL in many cases we still make working drawings with a caps height of 10 centimeters,
  which we digitize using a version of FM that supports Wacom CAD tablets. However,
  any other value for the em can be used in DTL IkarusMaster, of course.  <BR>The
  default for the BE format is an em of 1000 units but any other value can be used
  here also. Converting a PS Type 1 font to the BE format will result in a 1:1 conversion
  of the outlines using the default setting. When scaling, there is always a change
  of rounding errors, of course. The conversion from IK to BE is controlled by the
  Max Deviation parameter in the PAR &#40;1&#41; dialog of DTL DataMaster. <BR> <BR>By
  the way, it seems that occasionally some of the modules of the current Light version
  of FM do not always function completely properly in the Classic mode. Creating an
  empty folder named TemporaryItems &#40;without a space&#41; on the root of the disk
  solves the problem.'
