  body: That is Linotype Palatino Light. The name is condensed 5.4% and has been spaced
    manually, but the bottom line is not condensed and is just widely letterspaced.

  body: What "&" symbol? I don't see one in the image you attached. The "e" in Palatino
    is not tilted. Are you sure you are looking at the correct image and/or font?
