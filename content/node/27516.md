    target=\"_blank\">this typophile.com search</a>, the first hit is named \xABPapyrus
    need to be put back in the tomb for a few decades\xBB :) - maybe you'll get some
    good ideas how to say no to your fathers idea.\r\n\r\nthe first and most important:
    you're the designer, its your job to know which typefaces evoke which emotions
    & conotations (and your father is hardly a designer, is he?).\r\n\r\nyou dont
    go to the doctor, and when he takes a certain instrument, you say \"oh, please
    use the other one, i just like the other one so much, this one looks to [...]\"
    - its his job to chose the instrument (in your case: the typeface)."

  body: "It's funny how certain fonts arouse this kind of reaction. Bryan only asked
    us what it was, not how we liked it. In Bellingham, where he's from, Papyrus is
    very popular judging from all the places I see it used up there. I say if that's
    what your father wants for his business, let him do it. He will be right in step
    with the very mellow community that lives there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for the support guys. \r\n\r\n\"(and your father is hardly a designer,
    is he?).\"\r\nHence the name \"KAM designs\" he see's himself as a designer because
    he designs waterfalls, and basically anything having to do with stone.\r\nTrust
    me I have tried explaining to him and suggesting another font and design at that.
    I think he is just being plain stubborn :D\r\n\r\nNever the less he gets a fantastic
    respons from his work alone. In his field most customers are more concerned about
    his stone work than the typeface he uses for his business card.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again guys.\r\nAnd thanks Mike for taking the time to research who you are actually
    helping. You are the kind of person we need more of in this world.\r\n"
