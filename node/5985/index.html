  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to learn font design by closely studying the works of the masters. To that end, I&#39;ve traced Century Catalogue from the ATF library. This version is scaled for 18pt size; I&#39;m probably going to use this as a testbed font for my wacky ideas about how to do optical scaling. <BR> <BR>I believe this is a fairly faithful rendering of the original ATF metal font. Of course, that means there are a bunch of things I would do differently - lengthen the top of the f, make the descenders a little longer &#40;with, perhaps, some strengthening of the lower bowl of the g&#41;, and probably making the serifs on the u more &#34;modern&#34;. <BR> <BR>I can imagine using this font to do math books; it feels like a cleaner cousin of Monotype Old Style No. 2 that was used by, among others, Letterproef Van de Garde to do, in my opinion, some of the finest math typesetting in print. <BR> <BR>Criticism is welcome. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42392.gif" alt="First prototype&#44; ATF Century Catalogue revival"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can&#39;t tell how close to the original this is, since I&#39;m not too familiar with the original &#40;and the &#39;23 ATF specimen I used to have is back at UCLA&#41;. <BR> <BR>Revivals: I rarely like them, but if you&#39;re going to do this I think your idea to try to improve it will save it from banality. On the other hand, it takes an experienced hand to improve on such a good design, so stay on your toes - and don&#39;t do anything drastic!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Besides the &#34;f&#34; I can&#39;t see any lc glyph that really needs help. And I wouldn&#39;t lengthen the descenders &#40;at least not for the text sizes&#41;, because you&#39;d be wasting setting economy with little gain in return. A good way to determine vertical proportions is this: the &#34;g&#34; should look <i>slightly</i> cramped&#42;. The biggest thing I might change would be making the caps smaller. And what about the numerals? I might make them hybrids. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which actually ties in to the &#34;ugliness&#34; I was talking about elsewhere. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">McGrew&#39;s American Metal Typefaces explains that Century Catalogue is Century Old Style with taller ascenders. --The descenders look longer also. MF Benton was such a great craftsman, that I suspect trying to change it will be a lesson in how smart his decisions were. <a href="http://fontbureau.com/" target="_blank">Font Bureau</a> has successfully revived and expanded a lot of Benton stuff, with great craftsmanship, so be sure to study what they have done. You&#39;ve chosen a terrific face to work on.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments and encouragement. <BR> <BR>If you look closely, you&#39;ll see that, while Century Catalogue is clearly based on Century Oldstyle, there are more differences than the length of ascenders and descenders &#40;yes; Oldstyle has short descenders to the point of stubbiness&#41;. Overall, it is both lighter and has increased contrast between thick and thin strokes. Individual glyphs have been updated thus: <BR> <BR>lower bowl of g is more like the classical, calligraphic design than the somewhat &#34;Hershey&#39;s Kiss&#34; shape in Oldstyle <BR> <BR>s and z serifs are more vertical <BR> <BR>U and H are wider <BR> <BR>C stress is more vertical <BR> <BR>design of Q is Baskervillian, Oldstyle&#39;s is same as Century Expanded <BR> <BR>$ has two vertical strokes <BR> <BR>The italic tells an entirely different story than the roman, however; it&#39;s more clearly based on Baskerville Italic than Century Oldstyle Italic. Overall, the main differences are that Century Catalogue Italic is expanded a fair amount, and the descenders have been shortened. Other than that, there are very few differences except that the exaggerated slant of A V and W has been removed. <BR> <BR>Overall, I really like the effect of all the differences in the Roman; it seems to combine the comfort of Century Oldstyle with the more refined atmosphere of fine printing in the style of Baskerville. <BR> <BR>By the way, I&#39;ve placed 200dpi scans of Century Oldstyle &#40;and a number of other pages of the 1923 ATF catalouge&#41; online here: <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/" target="_blank">http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/</a> <BR> <BR>I can make high quality 2400 dpi scans available to anyone interested; the roughly 30M per page filesize makes me reluctant to just throw them up on the server.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ralph, if you could make me a 2400 dpi scan of the Garamond &#40;only the stuff that&#39;s 14 point and below&#41; from the &#39;23 that would be really nice of you. <BR> <BR>BTW, the JPEG artefacting on those 200dpi scans is pretty major... Here&#39;s a quick routine I&#39;ve come up with to make type specimen scanning both accurate and lean.
