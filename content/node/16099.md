body: I would welcome any feedback on the attached logo(type), I am looking for some
  opinion on letterspacing, ideally I'd like to keep the logo the same length as it
  is already. Also any suggestions as to supportive typefaces for use in corporate
  literature and electronic documents (internal email etc). The company, Greencell,
  supply avocados, kiwi fruits and like to reatil outlet Waitrose amongst others and
  are very happy with what they have seen so far (the result as attached) so not a
  lot can change, it's now at the fine tuning stage. All comments  positive and negative
  will be greatly appreciated.

    body: Thanks Tim, the dark area is on a list of things to do, unfortunately I
      can't work on the logo for a day or so, will post revisions as and when I can
      make them.

  body: The 'll' bothers me. I thought it might be the flat terminals, but it might
    just be their length. They feel too short to me, by just a little bit, particularly
    in respect to the other letters. Adjusting the kerning like Tim suggested may
    help. I understand the desire to keep the overal wordmark compact, but it bugs
    my eye.

  body: I don't like the icon being part of the type. If made small (website) it will
    disappear. Can you separate the icon from the type?

    body: 'The leaf ''icon'' up until recently has been separate to the type however
      because the g character of the word is to be used standalone as a graphic device,
      we (the client and myself) had a problem whereupon the g by itself (with the
      green leaf to the right and up and out somewhat looked too much like the number
      9 and because the logo will be used in non-English speaking countries there
      was the possibility that the green leaf looked like random punctuation. There
      is also the intention for the icon disappear at smaller sizes to reinforce the
      g being read as a g. I would post a sample but I am at home. p.s I am Lumo at
      work, LMcat at home. '

  body: My problem is the n, why does it have round terminals and all of the other
    characters have squared off terminals? I also fear the leaf will get lost in smaller
    sizes.

        are unfortunately long gone, the type treatment for this logo has been approved
        by the client (who didn't even want the logo to be green).\r\n\r\nAs I have
        said the logo is at fine tuning stage where the only changes that can be made
        are very fine tweaks to curves, letterspacing and character details, I'll
        repsot some examples later today taking on board the earlier letterspacing
        suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks, Lumo."

  body: "I think this an improvement in the kerning but the gr space is slightly too
    much, however the eence look to have a lower baseline than the gr, whereas the
    l extends past the baseline. And while the client has approved the basic layout
    I think you should look at the interaction of the ll, although they are the same
    they have an optical illusion of being different, something to do with the curve.\r\nTim"

    body: I agree entirely about the double l's, will need to look at this. The baseline
      does vary, although this is intentional as the g and r appeared to drop too
      low when the baseline was even. The l's are going to be tricky, I wish to keep
      the tails to pad the overall wording out.

    on the top or bottom. Right now its a mish mash with no reason in my view.

    round one on the n.

      and further work is being produced in terms of supportive graphics, advertising
      styles and website deployment, unfortunately there isn't the time for further
      refinement to the logotype.
