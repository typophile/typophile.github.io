    Sans</a>. Can you describe what it is you like about Triplex and why you can't
    use it?

  body: I'm not looking for a specific face to use...I guess it's more for interest
    and research in a way. Concerning Triplex, I suppose the sloped stroke endings
    on the stems is what I am most attracted to. Thanks for the help.

  body: "Ahh, I've heard this form categorized as \"lapidary\", but only once or twice,
    so I'm not confident about the definition.\r\n\r\nXavier Dupr&eacute;'s new <a
    href=\"http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?SVisSaBdA.html\">Vista Sans</a>
    (also from Emigre) has some very subtle terminal angles, but you really need to
    see it in print (ask for their amazing specimen book just mailed). Come to think
    of it, it's sort of the grown-up version of Triplex."

  body: 'Stephen, I got the Vista spec book from Emigre the other day and I had a
    licence by that evening. I have one question why do Emigres'' faces have such
    loose kerning pairs? I can understand that in small sizes but in display sizes,
    well, its like work to kern them. '
