  for both the script logotype face (which I think is contemporary), and something
  that closely resembles the wall type, which is probably old hand lettering based
  on some classic form. But maybe not?! Candidates for the wall so far include Emigre
  Brothers, Brokman, PF Din Display Pro, Intropol, and Pill Gothic. Thanks for your
  help!"

    the serif face, and I agree that PF Din Display is good for BURROUGHES (I can
    do the G myself).\r\n\r\nAnyone have any clue about that upright script face?
    I can't seem to find it."

  body: Thanks all for the pointers. PF Din Display and Antique Block are working
    well; once I have a good script candidate I'll be all set to work within the style.
    I still haven't found anything, but will keep checking back here. Thanks again!
