body: Dear Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Right now I am working on a redesign of a logo for
  a textile company Velana, one of the largest producers of curtains in Central Europe.
  The first image shows how the logo looks like now, the other three are my proposals...
  <BR> <BR>Thanx! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24586.gif"

  body: Matjaz, <BR> <BR>My first remark would be that this approach for LC &#34;a&#34;
    combined with the other letters found in the name make the logotype appear uneven
    and unbalanced. The size ratio change is a good thing, but don&#39;t you think
    something in between would look better? <BR>Also, the design for &#34;v&#34; interferes
    with the instant recognition of the letter, thus making the name itself hard to
    read. out of all there, the first one is neat and has far more potential to be
    made into a corporate mark. <BR> <BR>George

  body: YOUR first one. The one to be redesigned was left out of question :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The idea is that you overloaded the last two sketches with design gimmicks
    that are too much even for a logotype, let alone the fact that your name has a
    symbol alongside. I would keep the name more discreet, or connect it somehow to
    the curvilinear feel of the symbol.

    &#34;directions.&#34; You&#39;re just making the &#34;thread&#34; in the green
    square thicker and changing the typeface. Have you come up with any new ideas?
    <BR> <BR>I also don&#39;t see the necessity of a redesign. Maybe you could add
    a more natural typeface to it and create a more elegant whitespace flow inside
    the box...I&#39;d think about how the white-space &#34;thread&#34; flows inside
    the green box. It&#39;s too mechanical in yours, which is the problem I see with
    the original. That &#34;thread&#34; &#40;white space in the box, whatever it&#39;s
    supposed to be, I think of a piece of thread for sewing&#41; could flow into and
    out from the box better. If it&#39;s supposed to be a &#34;V&#34; then you can
    make it better. <BR> <BR>The type you have makes me think I&#39;m about to walk
    into a state-of-the-art Oxygen bar or something. I don&#39;t know much about textile

    agree with some of the other posts about the type--the &#34;Current logo &#40;to

    Even straight patterns in textiles have curves once you look up close. <BR> <BR>I
    would suggest that you do something to make this feel more human or fabric like.
    Not so vertical, horizontal, or straight. Make it flow. Push a more freeform,
    flowing direction, then if necessary, bring in some more gridded design to control
    the potential chaos. Am I making any sense? Some of the illustrations in the link
    below might help loosen you up a bit, but notice how alot of them maintain a controlled
    grid combined with free flowing forms. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.chapter3.net/"

    <BR>The problem here IMHO, is the type. I think this kind of lettering reaks of
    present trends: a monoline where the v=n e=a etc. It does so in the same way that
    photolettering smells of the 1970s and now looks dated. So be careful with this
    approach. <BR> <BR>One way to distance yourself from this problem might be to
    use more traditional forms, but keeping the monoline &#40;eg Foundry Monoline&#41;.
    Or you could try a fresh take on an established genre &#40;a neo grotesque, or
    humanist sans, or a semiserif&#41;. How about some of Storm&#39;s offerings: Teuton,
    Sebastian, John Sans, or Dyna Grotesque? Maybe contact Christain Robertson about
    using Pill Gothic! There&#39;s an idea. Good luck! <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: I&#39;m going to echo most of the other posts here, and say that the old logo
    isn&#39;t bad, just old. I think that Daniel&#39;s suggestions tap into a good
    new direction. There&#39;s still a lot there in the old Velana logo. It just looks
    a bit stuffy, IMO. <BR> <BR>I think the type should stay close to its original
    &#40;in terms of the typeface&#41;, and maybe even a similar orientation of mark
    to type, particularly because it&#39;s quite known in Slovenia. Plus, if you keep
    the same rough proportions, it can be used in ways similar to the old logo. Don&#39;t
    be too eager to violate the brand equity. I do like your tweaking of the logo
    in the A examples. The B example looks nice, but starts to lose the &#39;V&#39;
    quality of the old mark. The dip seems too shallow to me, if you&#39;re going
    to make the curves more exaggerated. <BR> <BR>Be sure to emphasize to your clients
    the difference between &#39;new and fresh&#39;, and &#39;disposable&#39;.
