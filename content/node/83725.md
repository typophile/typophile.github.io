  in Greece use Arno Pro's ones? And if there other fonts that have it? Is it worth
  doing in a venetian typeface? \r\nThank you in advance!"

  body: "I've made them, and will continue to do so. Smallcaps have been used at times
    to emulate square uncial letters in the transcription of ancient manuscripts.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to Andreas' comment re. dropping of accent and breathing marks in all-caps
    (and hence smallcaps) settings, it should be noted that this is a recent convention.
    If you look at Greek language publishing from before the mid-19th Century, you'll
    see plenty of all-cap settings with marks in place <em>above the letters.</em>
    The placement of marks to the left of uppercase letters in mixed case, which led
    to their being dropped in all-caps, is also a recent development. It is the modern
    standard, but I've yet to find examples of it prior to the 19th Century; prior
    to that, marks were placed above capitals (the Byzantine norm), or even to the
    right of them in widely spaced all-caps settings.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted
    that the rules for marks in all-caps settings according to the modern convention
    is not so straightforward as simply removing them all, because there are circumstances
    in which a dialytika must be <em>added</em> to a cap Iota or Ypsilon to preserve
    correct vowel pronunciation."

  body: "I'm trying now to make calt feature for removing accents in all-caps setting,
    and as i could understand from the thread http://typophile.com/node/15982, there
    should be dialytika over Iota in all-caps setting in the pairs \u03B1\u03B9 \u03B5\u03B9
    \u03BF\u03B9 \u03C5\u03B9 \u03B1\u03C5 \u03B5\u03C5 \u03BF\u03C5 if the first
    letter in the pair has oxya or tonos. I wrote calt for monotonic and it works.
    \r\nJohn, could you also explain how will it be for polytonic? Will the letters
    which have only tonos (oxya) or  both tonos (oxya) and breathings (like uni1F0A,
    uni1F0B, uni1F0B, uni1F0C...) follow that rule?     "

  body: Basically, in any of those pairs if there is <em>any</em> mark on the first
    letter, then the second letter should get a dialytika when the mark is suppressed
    in all-caps/smallcaps. Since the convention of Greek diphthongs is that the marks
    are always written on the second letter, you know that if the mark is written
    on the first then you are dealing with something other than a diphthong, so the
    dialytika will apply. If you've got your monotonic <calt> lookup working with
    the tonos, then it should be simple to extend the context to cover the other marks.

    don't add dialytica if there is only a breathing (dasia, psili) without a mark?
    \r\nAnd one more question: Should the upper case letters with lower-case iota

    the presence of the marks on the first vowel letter is sufficient to indicate
    that the pair is not a diphthong. The dialytika is only necessary when the other
    marks have disappeared.\r\n\r\nLigatures is a whole new topic. Basically, you
    have three options:\r\n\r\n1. create ligature glyphs that include marks and have
    these form for sequences of letters and marks;\r\n\r\n2. allow letter ligatures
    to form regardless of the presence of a mark (set the OTL lookup process marks
    flag to NONE) and then apply marks to component letters of a ligature using GPOS
    anchor attachments;\r\n\r\n3. prevent letter ligature formation when marks are
    involved (set the OTL lookup process marks flag to ALL; probably also include
    post-sequence mark context to prevent ligation, although you could take a following
    mark and position it on the last component or above a diphthong ligature such
    as the traditional omicron_upsilon form).\r\n\r\nNote that any combination of
    these options could be used in a font. For example, you may find that some horizontally
    laid out ligatures will adapt well to approach 1 or 2, while some of the funkier
    Byzantine ligatures like the omicron_sigma really can't and should not form when
    marks are involved."

    (for example uni1F88) when changing mute iota for capital Iota or should it remain
    with accents and changed capital Iota?\r\nAnd about ligatures: when saying about
    GPOS anchor attachments do you mean GPOS LookupType 5 (Mark-to-Ligature attachment
    positioning) in a mark feature? I have never written it, but Adobe OpenType Feature
    File Specification says that this LookupType is currently not implemented... I
    tried to implement an example from this Specification in my font to understand
    how it works, but  Fontlab couldn't compile it and wrote: syntax error at \"mark\".
    Does Fontlab support mark feature? \r\nMaybe it would be easier to create ligature
    glyphs that include marks.\r\n\r\nAnd do i understand right that there is an accent
    over the last letter in the diphthong ligature like in an unconnected diphthong
    pair? Does it mean that all the unconnected letters and letter pairs with accents
    keep their accents when they are in ligatures too? \r\nCould you please write
    other Byzantine ligatures which can't form with marks? \r\nDo i understand right

  body: "I'm inclined to say \"go for it\". Since polytonic Greek accents are used
    with ordinary capital letters, then, if small capitals are used in Greek text
    written in a polytonic fashion, it would seem as though it would be unnatural
    for the accents not to be available there.\r\n\r\nThe only question remaining,
    though, is if small capitals are used in Greek typography at all. <em>That</em>,
    to me, would be the only issue. If Greek typography does not make use of small
    capitals, then having them in a Greek typeface is not really appropriate.\r\n\r\nBut
    if small capitals have a place, since polytonic script is actually in fairly common
    use even now, despite not being the normal standard for modern texts, I would
    think that providing the accents for the small capitals is a very sensible thing
    to do."

  body: "Yulia, you'll need to do some of your own research on Byzantine cursive ligation.
    This is a complex topic, and I don't have resources in digital form that I can
    easily share with you. But here are some things to head you in the right direction:\r\n\r\nWhen
    Greek ligatures fell out of fashion in the 19th Century, some people made an effort
    to document them for the benefit of typesetters who may be called upon to re-set
    Greek text that featured ligatures. So if you look at e.g. William Savage's <em>Dictionary
    of the art of printing</em> (1841) you will find a table of Greek ligatures with
    corresponding unligated forms (pp.300-301). I have a reprint edition of this book
    from 1966. There is a similar but shorter table in Th\xE9otiste Lefevre's <em>Guide
    pratique du compositeur et de l'imprimeur typographes</em> (1855; reprinted 1999).\r\n\r\nI
    strongly recommend that you take a look at Ensched\xE9 and Carter's <em>Typefounddries
    in the Netherlands,</em> which contains tables of two different sizes of Granjon
    Greek types with somewhat different ligature sets. These are important. What I
    find interesting is that the smaller size type has more ligatures that the larger
    size. Having looked at the way in which these different sizes were used in books,
    I've come to the conclusion that the ligatures were valued for space saving, and
    hence there are more of them in the smaller font that was used for foot and marginal
    notes in tight spaces.\r\n\r\n<em>And do i understand right that there is an accent
    over the last letter in the diphthong ligature like in an unconnected diphthong
    pair? Does it mean that all the unconnected letters and letter pairs with accents
    keep their accents when they are in ligatures too?</em>\r\n\r\nYes. Ligation never
    suppresses accents. Note that some combinations of letters have more than one
    possible ligature form, and some forms are better suited to carrying accents than
    others."

    seen some digitized greek manuscripts online from British Library and they have
    a lot of ligatures. I could use some manuscript ligature forms in my type, but
    they look rather archaic and maybe it makes sense to have them as a discretionary
    ones (off by default). Here are examples:  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/2011-08-20_15_3914.00.02.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2011-08-20_15_6188.06.04.png]\r\nMany
