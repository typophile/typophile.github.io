  body: "I can see it. For some reason, it takes long to load. (I don't know what
    it is, though.)\r\n\r\nEdit: It's 572k. That could explain it.\r\n\r\nFurther
    edit: I can't explain why the file is 572k. Photoshop shows it as being only 48k
    when you open it. Also, it is a CMYK jpeg, which some browsers can't (won't?)
    display."
