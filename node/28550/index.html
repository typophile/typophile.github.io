<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
Upper management where I work just decided that the Convocation booklet (the order of proceedings and list of graduate names for the graduation ceremony) ought to be bilingual. And I think I may be bald by November.
It's a small-ish book. (8.5 x 11 folded) and there are a few pages of text like "message from the President" and "A word about Concordia" etc... I'm having a tough time figuring out how to incorporate all this French text--Even the titles of the dudes presenting degrees (Vice-Dean of Fine Arts, Provost, etc) need to be bilingual.
So what I'm wondering is this: Can anyone point me to examples of other similarly sized *bilingual* books? I think this would probably be a lot easier if I were working with a full letter sized page. Somehow, though, I don't think I'll be able to convince them to change the booklet size.
As I see it I have three options: 1-- do a flip-over back to back booklet. This means double the pages and also double the work importing and updating names in two different places. 2-- Double columns left-english righ-french. This may get confusing for the reader and I think it looks cluttered. Results in short, newspaper-column-like line lengths. 3-- alternating so that French always appears on the left hand page and English always on the right.
At least with option two and three the list of graduates names only has to be included once, with the headers (Bachelor of Fine Arts) appearing in both languages above the list.
Does anyone have any thoughts or experience with this? I've never done a bilingual publication--usually we do them separately. I'm feeling a little lost and dejected about this. The book had just been re-designed and was looking very lovely. No more. *sigh*
Thanks for any input you can give.
Kristina</div>

<div class=commentbody>Did a couple of bilingual things when I lived in Ottawa and used your option 2. Because of the size you're talking about, though, I'd go for option 3. Option 1 reminds me of my new Dremel catalogue.... ;-)

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Linda.
Here in Finland I've sometimes seen (and designed, too) solutions, where Finnish is in different font and/or colour and/or size to Swedish, even when they appear on the same page. Swedish being the minority language (but an official one), it usually gets the secondary role. I assume in Canada one should treat the languages equally, at least in size?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you!
I played with Option 2 yesterday and was feeling rather discouraged. I'll try using 2 different fonts -- because I think that on the second and third pages the reader will need some kind of visual cue -- and, no, I couldn't make the French smaller. Although I wonder if the sign law applies ;)
I'll post when I'm done. This kind of stuff always happens at the 11th hour, though, doesn't it?
Thanks again,

<div class=commentbody>You might look at TYPO magazine which does Czech and English.

Also, the Swiss print many things in 3 languages. you might see if any of their solutions help.

<div class=commentbody>I don't think the language cops would come after you, but hey <em>shrug</em> it's Quebec, anything is possible. ;-)
Depending on what sort of colour specs you're working with, there may be an Option 4: what about setting the English in one colour and French in the other? Combine that with one as a serif and the other sans, and you've got some good visual cues that won't take up excessive space or eat into a whole lot of time on your part.

<div class=commentbody>A variation on using two colours, done by a dutch design firm for a book:
White paper. Text in green overprints text in red (mingled as it were…), red and green filters provided with book to block out "other" colour as needed. Very clever.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The only I can add is the text in French is longer that text in English. So the options that place French and English together will result in a shorter English column than the French. But I figure you already know this.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As much as I would like to be able to do two colours, we are unfortunately limited to black inside. The cover is black and burgundy.
I tried combining sans with serif, but honestly I don't have much selection (can you say budget cut backs?) - I think all the sans I have look terrible next to any of the serifs I would want to use, and also don't include all the features I'd like them to. We're trying for "elegant and conservative" (not my words)... as well as legible enough for the parents and grandparents of the graduates. ;) I've settled on Minion Pro and I think I might set the French in italics. I know it's harder to read, but English is our primary audience. Also it may help keep the French text from surpassing the length of the English by too much. I think I'll play with the two column/one column idea as well.
Thanks you for the suggestions!
Gotta go - fire drill.... grrr.

<div class=commentbody>I think going with Minion Pro and the italic is a great choice, given your constraints, and you can always tweak the tracking or spacing to help suck in a bit more space <em>pour les mots en francais</em> if you need to.
(At least it's <em>only</em> a fire drill, given how close you are to Dawson.)

<div class=commentbody>I have another question maybe you can answer. I read in one of those links that on facing pages bilingual pages (option 3 above) I can/should number them with the same page number. However, I will switch after about page 10 to the list of names, which I won't repeat on both pages of the spread. Do you think it's ok for me to change the page number mid-booklet or should I number even the beginning pages sequentially despite them being the same content. (was that clear?)
Thanks again,
Kristina</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you have a bilingual contents page you should probably, for the sake of clarity, number each page separately or you could just number spreads rather than each page. My choice, though, would be for sequential numbering throughout.
