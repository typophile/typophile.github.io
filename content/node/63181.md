  body: "I think it\u2019s great that you do these kind of exercises! \r\n\r\nI like
    how the letters in dino are so playful, though the dinosaur d is not obvious enough
    yet. You need to play more with the head. Especially the mouth. \r\nI think the
    tagline typeface is to serious, to straight, to work with the wordmark. I\u2019d
    look for something a little more playful."

  body: "Cool concept but I agree with frode. I think it would work better if your
    dino letters were all on a baseline too. They seem to be drifting upwards right
    now.\r\n\r\nAlso, try putting the tagline underneath dino left aligned."

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have to say this: Well done on the initiative / self-practice!\r\n\r\nThe
    logo has the right amount of simplicity and fun relating to kids. The incorporating
    of the dinosaur image is good. \r\n\r\nSuggestions: \r\n1.The dinosaur's head
    seems to be a tad too awkward with the mouth. \r\n2. You would need to choose
    whether to place the tagline eschewed to the right with the brandname 'dino' in
    an upward curve OR a more traditional centrally-aligned under 'dino'.\r\n\r\nThis
    may come as a surprise, but I've just recently completed a similar design:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dinosaur4_4679.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dinosaur3_5689.jpg]\r\n\r\nnagfa"

  body: I love the "o" in the Dino. I don't like the color of the tag, and maybe you
    shouldn't use Museo--try a less serious font maybe?
