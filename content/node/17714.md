      way to identify a typeface apart from putting it into a basic category ie sans,
      serif, slab atc\r\n\r\nTrying to learn how to identify a face but never know
      where to start"

  body: There's so much out there you can't learn it all methodically.  Best way I
    know how is to study everything every major foundry has to offer, and then do
    the same as they release new stuff. You have to be a little obsessed to be really
    good at typeface identification.
