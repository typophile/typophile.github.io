    punctuates this as 'The George, Washington University'.\r\n\r\nAny branding firm
    worth its salt would have ditched the 'The'. Even the article is inconsistent
    in its naming of the institution: 'George Washington University Unveils New Visual
    Identity ', and William and, I suspect, most other students and alumni simply
    refer to it as George Washington University."

  body: "Hrant, you read my mind perfectly!\r\n(I must have been thinking in Legato.)\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of squared-off layout, typi\uFB01ed by Peretz Rosenbaum\u2019s renaming of
    self as Paul Rand in the early 1930s, is quintessentially Early Modern, producing
    a neat, reductive, geometric layout element while not yet accomodating the High
    Modern sophistication of ragged setting and full asymmetry.\r\n\r\nA symbol for
    training people to think inside the box?\r\n\r\nThe monochrome image of Washington
    is more \u201Cairbrushed\u201D than \u201Cdigital\u201D.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2026 the
    old, dated logo \u2026 created an impression of a behind-the-times university.</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    I imagine that the rationale would have been: Keeping the squared-off layout provides
    brand continuity, and switching to a sans updates."

  body: Well, since you asked, yes, I liked the old branding much better. The typography
    seems much more sophisticated, and I really like the fact that they went to the
    trouble of producing a "woodcut" version of the portrait for B&W uses. However,
    without seeing the standards manual for the new branding, it's not really a fair
    comparison. What does the "digital" portrait look like in B&W? What supplemental
    typefaces are meant to go with the new logo? The new campaign seems to involve
    mixing blocky sans serif caps with a classical italic (Hoefler?) for emphasis,
    which is an interesting nod to the classical typography of the pervious branding.
    Maybe, if the quote in the article about how "each department had its own identity"
    is true, all they needed to do was actually read the existing standards guide.

  body: "> A vast majority of students and alums (like myself) dislike it...\r\n\r\nI
    used to do design work for a large university. Students and alumni develop a nostalgic
    fondness for the university's logo and changes can create a strong negative reaction.
    I respect your opinion and can see why you like the old logo, but an initial negative
    reaction is common and doesn't necessarily mean that the change is bad in the
    long run.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the administration says, the new logo wasn't designed
    for the alumni or current students anyway. It's designed for the kids in high
    school who are considering attending your university. When they went to your website
    on their iPads and saw the old logo, it created an impression (fairly or unfairly)
    of a behind-the-times university. There is fierce competition for students and
    the administration believed the old logo was hurting more than helping.\r\n\r\n>
    very expensive firms \r\n\r\nI'm sure they were, but people often don't realize
    the vast amount of work that goes into redesigning a university's identity system.
    They think you just make a few sketches and you're done. Actually you've got endless
    meetings with university committees that can't agree on anything, tons of research,
    redesign after redesign, plus you're not just designing a logo, you're also redesigning
    their publications, website, signage, vehicle graphics, etc. It's a HUGE amount
    of work.\r\n\r\nAs for the logo itself, I can't say that I love it, and I understand
    your fondness for the old one, but if their goal was to create a more contemporary
    logo they succeeded."

  body: "James, although I agree that engaging prospective students is very important,
    you can't ignore the people who are already on the inside, because you want to
    leverage their pride. Also you most certainly shouldn't ignore alumni since a
    lot of money and connections come from there - in fact apparently the chairman
    of FutureBrand (that co-created the new identity) is an alumnus!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "> you can't ignore the people who are already on the inside\r\n\r\nI agree,
    and ideally you want students to love the new logo.\r\n\r\nBut if they don't,
    they may grumble but they are unlikely to leave because of it. But high school
    students may indeed decide not to attend if the university's old logo -- along
    with the look of the publications and website -- creates the wrong image. \r\n\r\n>
    \ shouldn't ignore alumni since a lot of money \r\n> and connections come from
    there\r\n\r\nTotally agree. Alumni are extremely important.\r\n\r\nBut you can't
    run a university without displeasing alumni sometimes. Tear down a cherished (but
    outdated) building and there will be howls of protests from alumni. Fire the coach
    and some alumni will never donate another penny. Heck, I even saw an alumni go
    ballistic because an old tree that he loved was cut down. You can't please everyone.
    Sometimes alumni offices have to smooth ruffled feathers."
