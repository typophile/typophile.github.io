  body: "Can you tell us what this is from? And how old it is?\r\n\r\nI am asking
    because it may be too old to have a digital font used in making it. In that case,
    you may be out of luck if the type was not digitized. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "

  body: "The lettering look Art Deco-ish to me, which suggests it's even older than
    the Fifties, as far as when the brand name logo was developed. I searched through
    Art Deco styles and was not able to find anything very close, although one or
    two of Nick Curtis's designs were probably close enough to be a starting point
    if you wanted to re-create this look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
