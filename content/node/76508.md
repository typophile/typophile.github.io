  a way to describe the difference between the top of the \u0662 and \u0663 basically
  the difference between one looking like a U and other a W.\r\n\r\nDo you have some
  resources or refences/cheat sheets that you can point me to?"

  body: "I agree with tooth suggestion, that what I'd use myself. Also note that Arabic
    two can be written with a horizontal stroke with no teeth at all (This what children
    are taught in Egypt and how I write it by hand myself), but very few fonts implement
    it. This from KacstOne font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/two_5078.png]"

  body: Indeed, AFAIK it was proposed by the <em>Academy of the Arabic Language in
    Cairo</em> specifically to cut the confusion between Arabic 2 and 3.

  body: "The Academy is mainly concerned about linguistic issues, but one of their
    interesting type related proposals was their simplified Arabic typecase where
    each letter has only two glyphs; one for initial and medial forms and one for
    isolated and final forms, with the main intent of decreasing time and cost of
    the printing process. Those that typecase were never used (expect in composing
    the booklet proposing it), it can be seen in later development's like Linotype
    Yakout.\r\n\r\nThere were also some recommendations about the positioning of diacritical
    dots and vowel marks to make it less ambiguous (calligraphers tend to position
    them freely on artistic basis, sometimes making text unreadable)."

  body: May be, may be because it were too ugly as Yakout (which implements the same
    ideas) were picked by newspapers and remains in use even today. Also the largest
    Egyptian press by then, Bulaq, later simplified their typecase but in a much less
    drastic way (from 470 to 238 glyphs without counting vowel marks, compared to
    135 glyphs in the Academy case including vowel marks).
