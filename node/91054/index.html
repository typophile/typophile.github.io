  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Does anybody know a way (likely through a font creator or editor program) where I can trick the font into thinking it's a different point size? Basically, I am working with Helvetica Neue, and it happens to be a very large font. I want the pull down menu in whatever program I'm using to display a 12pt as 10pt, for example. Even though it's truly a 12pt font, it is reading out as a 10pt font. Is there any way to reset the point size designations in a font so that it displays different designated point size numbers?</div>

If I can have the Properties read 12pt (when in reality the font is 10pt) that is the goal. These people know nothing of typography and I'm sick of their stupid regulations deciding my designs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Create all of your documents at 120% of their original size. For example, if the specs tell you to create something at legal size (8 1/2 x 11"), create it at 10.2 x 13.2".
Then use your font at 12pt (which is what the Properties will show). When printing to the intended page size, select "Scale to Fit" in the printing dialog. Of course you must be printing to the intended paper size.

If you say, "well, won't they notice the page size is larger?", I can ask the same thing about using a smaller font size than requested.

(Without <em>clearly</em> cheating like this, about the only real option I can think of is scale down an otherwise perfectly good Helvetica with a good font editor that will not screw up any of the size related font measurements and features, as there are spacing or kerning.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Are you absolutely sure that the font size is NOT a legislated requirement from the state or federal government? If it is, trying to evade it by twiddling the font is the kind of thing that could get your employer in serious legal trouble, and you fired.

I recently consulted for one of the ten largest companies in the US on essentially this exact same issue. Somebody somewhere along the way screwed up—possibly because they decided they were above some silly “arbitrary regulation”—and they are now facing litigation about the type allegedly not being big enough in a standardized letter they send out.

I also was once consulted by the San Diego DA's office on a similar case. It was marketing materials, but there was indeed a legal requirement around point size. Unfortunately the malefactors came up with a very clever way to deke out the requirement, which I won't repeat here (though I will probably cover it in my talk at Typo SF). But suffice it to say I told the DA's office they were out of luck.

In other words, be very careful.

Cheers,

Again, yes it's stupid, but it's a legal issue. So this is definitely not something you want to do just to please your aesthetic sensibilities without further consulting with those with law degrees.
