  before.  I have a few questions about student placement/internships (mainly in the
  NYC area).  \r\n\r\nBasically, I want to know what companies and designers look
  for in a student's portfolio.  And, what do you look for in a person? I know each
  place and person will be different, but what are key things that you look for in
  hiring someone for a short work placement?  Also, any other advice would be great
  because I need it!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

    a student\u2019s portfolio. And, what do you look for in a person.</cite>\r\n\r\nFrom
    my experiences interviewing to be an intern employers want <em>relevant</em> creativity
    and effort. By relevant creativity, I mean that they look for a portfolio of work
    in line with work they want their firm to produce. For example, when I took my
    retro-modernist stuff to a firm where everything is hip and current and wildly
    creative, I got some weird looks and no callback. When I took that portfolio to
    a firm that uses vast amounts of negative space and grotesque sans in much of
    their work, I got the job. If you have a big portfolio with a variety of work,
    you can show different stuff to different employers and leave out irrelevant work.
    \r\n\r\nMy advice is to either look for an internship in a field you care about
    or want to learn about or to look for something at a large multidisciplinary firm.
    Before you interview, be ready to explain to them why you want to work there as
    opposed to the thousands of other hot internships in New York.\r\n\r\nLast, ignore
    people who tell you to have a big box full of boards and stuff to show off at
    interviews. It will just get out of order or something will get damaged or you\u2019ll
    have to hold up three boards with two hands and then need to point at something.
    I had some really disastrous interviews last semester when I had a big mixed portfolio,
    and next time it\u2019s all going into a nice book format. "

  body: "kowchow,\r\n\r\nI use to be in New York and every summer I'd hire one intern.
    (Truth is, I would do it do discourage people from going into typography.) The
    portfolios they brought were never very memorable. Every now and then there would
    be one original piece, but mostly it was school projects and done by direction,
    not love.\r\n\r\nWhen interviewing each time for this one person, the personality
    and motivational force was what was so important. I didn't want one more person
    there because they needed an internship -- I wanted someone there that really
    loved what they were doing and had the desire to continue in that field - even
    though they were constantly reminded they were becoming dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nI've
    stayed in touch with a few of the interns - not many, since I've left the city.
    One thing, I did pick people that loved type. One of them is now a literary agent
    and another a designer for a book publisher.\r\n\r\nOf those I interviewed and
    didn't hire, I wonder if they stayed in this field... my mind says, \"NO WAY.\"\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, you are just starting out on your journey, and there are many difficult
    turns in the road ahead."

  body: That helped so much.  I actually just got an email back from a company I had
    an interview with and got the placement.  I start Tuesday and I am so excited!  Ah!  Thanks
    a lot for advice!
