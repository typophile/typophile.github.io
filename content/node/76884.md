  of the usual naff vernacular fonts available, and a few offerings\r\nat House Industries,
  does anyone know if there is anything akin to this effort anywhere else?\r\n\r\nI
  know it's hand drawn, but there must be something similar."

  body: Michael Doret's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/orion-md/|Orion]]
    is upright, and based on similar commercial lettering, but it's even more monoline
    than Radio. Tom Kennedy has the lovely [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/cosmiccursive.php|Cosmic
    Cursive]] over at Letterhead Fonts, although that might be a bit too "brushy".
