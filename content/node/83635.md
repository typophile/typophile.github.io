body: "So I've extended my Latin alphabet for my typeface to Greek. Initially some
  of the characters render poorly: \u03B2, \u03BC & \u03B8. Don't know if that me,
  the screen, or the application I open the PDF with.\r\nI guess I'm asking for as
  much direction as possible. I don't know any Greek so I'm banking on research that
  the letterforms are fundamentally correct. Clearly interpretations of what seems
  to be a primarily calligraphic language.\r\nI want to expand the Greek with all
  proper diacritics and accents within the alphabet but want to know if the foundation
  is correct first.\r\n\r\nLooks like my \xE1n\u014D tele\xEDa could be taken up a
  little bit, might sit a little low.\r\nAs for lowercase alpha, I also want to create
  a truer letterform of the single stroke figure eight style.\r\nThanks in advance."

    is born of (and perpetuates) confusion with German eszett.
