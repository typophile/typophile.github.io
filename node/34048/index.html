What do you think? Is there any precedent for this? What are the problems with this idea?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me clarify. I am not being anti-ligature here. Not at all. I think they are great at least when they are done well.</p>
<p>Instead of suggesting that we get of them I am thinking about how the flexibility of Opentype could help make a modest improvement in how ligatures are handeled. A while ago we had a thread on ligatures in which it was brought up that one problem with ligatures is that the letterspacing in them stays constant ( they are just one glyph ) so that if you have a justified line of text ( or just a letterspaced one ) they can start to look out of place by degrees as the letterspacing is increased or decreased.</p>
<p>The solution I have outlined above would let you have a ligature ( visually ) by &lsquo;fusing&rsquo; or overlapping an f&amp;i or an f&amp;l ( or whatever ) out of two glyphs made for the purpose. BTW : I have been told Gutenburg had ligatures like this.</p>
<p>The only change is technical. Ideally it would look the same except that it would cope with letterspacing a bit better.</p>

So if you track your text at +20, the ligatures will still hold, but they will look too tight.
At +10, not really an issue.
So it&rsquo;s up to the foundry to make the non-ligated f and i look OK at +20, so that discerning typographers can switch off &ldquo;ligature&rdquo; at that amount of tracking.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve given this some thought. The problem is that in order to make a convincingly good &lsquo;ligature&rsquo; out of individual glyphs, one would generally need to modify the design from the default forms of those letters. For example, in an ffi sequence, one might make the initial f slightly shorter than the second f, one would typically modify the curvature of the tops of the f&rsquo;s in order for them to connect nicely with the following letter or to overhang the stem of the dotless i, one would likely adjust the weight of the terminal of the first f where it meets the shoulder of the second, and one might extend the crossbar of the f so that it connects to the i. All these things are typical features of an ffi ligature glyph.</p>
<p>Now, all these things could be done to individual f f and i glyphs, which could then be contextually substituted to form an apparent ligature. But when letterspacing is applied what you end up with are forms of these letters that differ from their default forms but which have lost their ideal relationships by being spaced out.</p>

<p>I think you both know that in my heart I agree with you. Utterly. I am absurdly idealist too.</p>
<p>But at the same time I know that beautifully made watches get scratched, rugs get walked on, cars are driven and bugs smear their windshields, and letters are spaced. For the same reason that the wings of aircraft bend- to avoid a catastrophic snap or failure; isn&rsquo;t it better to design with built in flexibility?</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it a death by %? What I am saying is that at 5% or 10% The idea I have may be better. And 5-10% seems like like a reasonable real world scenario. I don&rsquo;t really know but that&rsquo;s my gut at the moment.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for weighing in!</p>
<p><cite> Practically speaking however, it would be nice if a font could have a

<p>Nice point.</p>
<p>And even if there is some meat on this arguement I am presenting - I do realize like all idealistic type ideas it has to be attempted to see if it is practical. Still, until I do; any other takers or rejectors?</p>

<p>The thing is, by the time a ligature looks too loose/tight in

<p>Exactly so! This is the reason why I excluded &lsquo;-i&rsquo; and &lsquo;-l&rsquo; ligatures from my list. (Not to mention the other constraint: the bar&rsquo;s width must not alter.)</p>
<p>H.P. &ndash; <cite>Practically speaking however, it would be nice if a font could have a field -ideally for each ligature- that tells InDesign when to break it.</cite></p>
<p>You mean, theoretically speaking. Practically speaking, this would be one more setting which would trouble type designers.  :))</p>
<p>The InDesign default bothered me in version 1.5 or 2 already, but I came to like the idea: in loose spacing there is no chance for collisions, so, no ligatures required. Another question would be: does this <cite>need</cite> automation, or isn&rsquo;t it the typographer&rsquo;s job to switch ligatures off?</p>
<p>[Added:]
This method makes other kinds ligatures possible. In a first version of Litteratra, I tested this with uppercase ligatures &ndash; e.g. the ones with a small &lsquo;I&rsquo; &lsquo;O&rsquo; below a bar of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; or above the bar of the &lsquo;L&rsquo;. (Especially uppercase ligatures <cite>require</cite> to be spaceable to avoid that they stand out in spaced caps-only text.)</p>

<p>I believe Quark does this (not for each ligature, of course). At least, they did back in version 4.x. The setting is the &ldquo;Break above&rdquo; field, and it was set in tracking units (those 1/200th em units so idiosyncratic to Quark). I believe it was in the Preferences dialog &gt; Character tab, or wherever it was that you turn on the fi/fl ligatures. Not sure if they carried this over to current versions.</p>
<p>InDesign does break ligs both above and below certain thresholds when tracking positive or negative. The threshold, however, is not user-definable and seems to be variable &ndash; not consistently the 25 quoted above.</p>
<p>I just tried it with a few different fonts. Whitman-Roman broke at +18 and -52. But WhitmanDisplay-Regular broke at +16 and -47. MillerText-Roman breaks at +20 and -56.</p>
<p>Interesting. I don&rsquo;t know what InDesign is using to calculate its threshold. Perhaps its based on widths of base characters.</p>
<p>Regarding using OT alt forms and substitution to create &ldquo;natural&rdquo; ligatures: It seems to me that any form of f that you design to merge gracefully with a following ascender will also stop working so nicely beyond a certain threshold range, and in the end may not be any better solution to this perceived problem than the &ldquo;break above&rdquo; software solution.</p>
<p>(Although, I agree, an expert function that allowed user re-definition of thresholds would be a nice feature.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There was an earlier discussion of Trinité bearing on this issue. IIRC, according to those familiar with it, it is designed without kerning or ligatures. I gather that the hook on the f &lsquo;swallows&rsquo; the dot on the i and combine with other characters smoothly. However, apparently the big overhang on the f presents a problem at the end of words, as it closes up the word space too much. Of course this could be taken care of, in principle, by an alternate f or kerning with the space.</div>

<p>Almost, but not quite. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it smooth. It needs both f-ligatures and a terminal &ldquo;f&rdquo;. As I remember, even the designer later felt the font needed ligatures and kerning.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant I still don&rsquo;t buy the notion of the elephant completely. I do agree that things go wrong quickly. Very. But I can&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s a all or nothing kind of thing. There must be a curve even if it&rsquo;s a small one. And I think it&rsquo;s likely that the design of the font itself will be a factor as well. In other words some fonts will look worse faster than others. So the devil will be in the details - the combnation &amp; the design.</p>
<p>One reason I had been thinking about this model for ligatures has to do with the ideas I had about making special pro-notan pairs &amp; triples etc. If you go to that much trouble then it seemed like having a modular ligature structure might be more efficient/practical and might help to mitigate in some real-world usage issues as well. In the system I am thinking about it may be that doing this is still a good idea, it just won&rsquo;t perform &lsquo;better&rsquo; than the old model in some cases. And in fact it might be worse in extreme cases because the InDesign Code won&rsquo;t let the ligatures turn off. Still, using the Logic of John &amp; Hrant the text is &lsquo;busted&rsquo; by then anyway. Maybe making that more obvious is good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks very much for asking. What I was saying was very speculative - but here is my reasoning.  ( all untested &amp; under-researched )</p>
<p>a. When you make a ligature in the normal way you are making a single glyph to replace two or three.  So I don&rsquo;t think the Lig tag supports multiple glyphs making a ligature. Is this right?</p>
<p>b. Indesign is looking for a Lig tag to invoke turning off Ligatures after tracking gets above a certain point. That&rsquo;s right isn&rsquo;t it? If I am using tags other than Lig to make my &lsquo;visual&rsquo; ligatures made from multiple glyphs as oposed to &lsquo;code&rsquo; ligatures of one glyph I can&rsquo;t expect InDesign to somehow understand this non-standard way of making a ligature.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>And actually - what do you think of the original idea from a type point of view?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with you there at all. At the risk of just being repetitive: Assuming that the break occurs after a narrow range of perhaps 5-7% letterspacing* ( the negative would be narrower still ) maybe the Notan is better preserved with micro-movements than with no movement at all. If so, the sweet spot itself isn&rsquo;t enlarged exactly - but it is blurred outwards. The point being 3% might be quite a bit better with the model I have in mind.</p>
<p>*Were do you think the break is?</p>
<p>The thing is, I actually like a ragged right better than justfied setting, but I don&rsquo;t imagine I can dictate that sort of thing to the buyer of my fonts.</p>
<p>I have related question too - maybe Gerald Lange can aswer this one: with letterpress the spacing in justified texts would be just between words - correct? At least in a long running text. Or would a letter setter put space between the letters themselves like InDesign does? Obviously you could do either thing. But what was typical?</p>
<p>If it was typical to set space just between words then my next question is - can you somehow make an H&amp;J in InDesign do that for you as well?</p>

<p>Gerald can weigh in with more direct experience, but I believe that adding space between letters was pretty impractical for justifying when setting by hand. Sure you could do it, but what comp would spend his time doing so? (Especially when the practice was so frowned upon &ndash; cue Goudy quote).</p>
<p>The justification mechanism in Linotype operated solely on the word spaces. I pretty certain this was the case with Monotype also, but I am not as well acquainted with that technology.</p>
<p><cite>can you somehow make an H&amp;J in InDesign do that for you as well?</cite></p>
<p>Sure, just set the Justification &gt; Letter Spacing to 0% Minimum | 0% Desired | 0% Maximum. That should direct the algorithm to operate only on word spaces (assuming you also leave Glyph Scaling alone at 100%, of course).</p>

Naturally, it depends upon the work at hand and the typeface being used, but 0% char spacing is a typical starting point.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the InDesign default starting point? I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve tweaked all my default prefs, so I can&rsquo;t be sure what was there to begin with. But I thought Adobe&rsquo;s default was decent.</p>
<p>I do recall vividly that the Quark default is (or used to be) totally whacked, something along the lines of Char Space: -4% Min / 0% Opt / 4% Max. I always advised designers to immediately change that default. (And I could always tell when they hadn&rsquo;t.)</p>

<p>a) Certainly the OpenType spec suggests that the &lsquo;liga&rsquo; feature would consist of many-to-one substitutions, and applications might be forgiven if they expect this. But it&rsquo;s certainly possible to stick something like this in the &lsquo;liga&rsquo; feature, at least as an experiment to see what happens.</p>
<p>b) That&rsquo;s right, you can&rsquo;t expect InDesign to turn off arbitrary other features because you happen to use them to do &lsquo;liga&rsquo;-like things. However, InDesign already treats &lsquo;calt&rsquo; in a similar way, and it would be a logical place for the functionality you describe, I think.</p>
