body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nCan anyone hep me to identify the font used in the pics below?
  It's the titling in Godard's film 'Vivre sa Vie.'\r\n\r\nI tried using whatthefont
  but the results weren't helpful. Could this be handmade lettering? It looks pretty
  regular to me, but it's hard to tell without better pictures. Sorry about the poor
  quality, the best I could find was screen captures from a myspace video.....\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Noel"

  body: I'm pretty sure that film lettering would have been done by hand at this point.
    Not only the variations in spacing, but the distribution of spacing in addition
    to the variants in widths would support this being the case. There are probably
    a dozen fonts similar to this in various ways, but none would be exactly the same.
