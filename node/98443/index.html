		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Type Directors Club is the leading international organization whose purpose is to support excellence in typography, both in print and on screen. Founded in 1946 by some of the industry’s leading practitioners, the TDC’s earliest membership included Aaron Burns, Will Burtin, Freeman Craw, Louis Dorfsman, Gene Federico, Edward M. Gottschall, Herb Lubalin, Edward Rondthaler, Bradbury Thompson, and Hermann Zapf. With this solid historical background, the TDC today represents the best of today’s type design and type use.</p>
<p>The TDC holds two yearly type competitions: one for the use of type and the letterform in design and the other, typeface design. The winners are reproduced in our Typography Annual, published by HarperCollins Publishers, as well as displayed in seven exhibits that travel worldwide. In addition to celebrating outstanding achievements, the typography competitions and resulting annuals serve as important historical records of typographic trends, and are an invaluable resource for both designers and scholars.</p>
<p>Education has always been an important part of the Type Directors Club’s mission. The TDC began offering lectures in 1947, the second year of the Club’s existence. Called Ten Talks on Type, the lectures were given by James Secrest, Arnold Bank, Gene Ettenberg, Charles Felton, Milton Zudeck, O. Alfred Dickman, Joseph Weiler, Frank Powers, and Hal Zamboni. The series’ success led to it becoming an annual event. In 1958, the Club extended its reach to an international day-long seminar at the Silvermine Artists Guild in New Canaan, Connecticut, which drew 500 attendees.</p>
<p>In 1959, the TDC ran Typography USA at the Biltmore Hotel in Manhattan. Speakers included Saul Bass, Herbert Bayer, Lester Beall, Will Burtin, Lou Dorfsman, Alvin Eisenmann, Gene Federico, William Golden, Allen Hurlburt, Leo Lionni, Herb Lubalin, Paul Rand, Ladislav Sutnar, and Bradbury Thompson.</p>
<p>Among the many speakers and teachers in the intervening years have been Aaron Burns, Klaus Schmidt, Ed Gottschall, Tom Carnase, Bruno Brugnatelli, Milton Glaser, Hermann Zapf, Eileen Hedy Schultz, Ed Benguiat, Olaf Leu, Martin Solomon, Günter Gerhard Lange, and Freeman Craw.</p>
<p>The current lecture and class schedule offered by the TDC continues apace. The Education Committee has been developing course offerings at all levels of proficiency that reflect today’s needs and interests, and the Event Committee continues scheduling monthly Type Salons in our Manhattan space.</p>
<p>The TDC is the home for typography—a physical meeting place and a strong professional affiliation. We welcome all in advertising, communications, education, marketing, and publishing who have a keen interest in type and the written word: graphic designers, art directors, editors, multimedia professionals, students, and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The TDC is a not for profit organization.</p>

<p>Much of my own exposure to the TDC has been via James Montalbano, which is of course pretty limiting. Now that James has gone postal I&rsquo;m interested to see how perceptions -if only my own- will change.

<p>One of my colleagues tipped me off to this thread. I see not much has changed since I &ldquo;went postal&rdquo;. Is that what it is Hrant? Deciding that reading your endless shit is &ldquo;going postal&rdquo; well if that is the case I&rsquo;m surprised that the majority of the folks here have not &ldquo;gone postal&rdquo; already.</p>
<p>Regarding &ldquo;improving&rdquo; the competition. Aren&rsquo;t you always going on about improving this or that? No skin off of your ass huh. Regarding the judges needing more time. This has been one of your idiot obsessions for years now. Hasn&rsquo;t it? Every year at the end of the competition, I ask the judges, &ldquo;Did you have enough time.&rdquo; Their answer, every year is &ldquo;Yes. Plenty of time, no reason to change the way this goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t you going to organize some special type design competition? I remember you going on and on about it a while ago. What happened? Too real for you?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Graham, FYI I myself am only focusing on the type design part.</p>
<blockquote>keep the initial entry fee price down which we hope encourages more entries.</blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind let&rsquo;s do the math (although roughly). Last year there were 173 entries and 13 winners. Choosing a mid-range entry (Type Family, Non-Member) this year&rsquo;s entry fee is $110 and the publication/hanging fee is $100. If you split 13 × $100 = $1,300 into 173 you get $7.51. So if you charged $118 (instead of $110) to enter but did not charge a publication/hanging fee you&rsquo;d about break even.</p>
<p>Now, I have to agree that charging $8 more might reduce the number of entries, but maybe not worrying about the $100 fee for winning might offset that. But most of all: it&rsquo;s more straight-forward, more honest; right now it really feels like a &ldquo;hidden cost&rdquo; to some people (even though I admit it&rsquo;s not really hidden).</p>

<p>Well, you&rsquo;re not forced to enter the competition. And I don&rsquo;t think anybody expects you to enter to make the TDC better off; people expect you to enter hoping to get something out of it. You know, a mutually-beneficial gambit.</p>
<p>BTW, I do think &ldquo;the TDC is a not for profit organization&rdquo; is a pretty good answer to your question.</p>
<blockquote>Can I opt out of the publication and traveling exhibitions?</blockquote>
<p>Officially, yes. But from what I understand (at least as of the last time I managed to &ldquo;extract&rdquo; the info) no winner has ever done that. So I guess that scenario hasn&rsquo;t been tested - but if push comes to shove I&rsquo;d expect the TDC to exclude you lest it sets a damaging precedent.</p>
<p>BTW, there&rsquo;s no cash - it&rsquo;s strictly fame &amp; glory.</p>

<p>True, but in the medical world there are various levels of certification, but in the U.S. there is no certification for designers; anyone can call themself a designer. So I think some professionals view awards as something to show clients as a way of validating their abilities. Contest fees are part of the cost of doing business.</p>

<p>The entry fees cover the expenses of bringing the judges together for judging, which presumably include airfare, hotel and meals for those who are outside NYC.</p>
<p>The winners' fees contribute towards the expenses of mounting the traveling exhibit and showing it at other conferences and locations. For example, the TDC award winners are typically shown in a huge display at both TypeCon (somewhere in the US) and ATypI (somewhere else in the world).</p>
<p>As ATypI Treasurer, I can attest that ATypI pays a goodly chunk of the costs of getting the exhibit to our conference (this year was Hong Kong). However, my recollection is that we aren&rsquo;t normally covering all the costs. For example, the costs of actually printing each entry out as a big full-color poster&hellip;.</p>

<p>The expenses don&rsquo;t go to offset the cost of THE traveling exhibit, they go to offset the costs of ALL the traveling exhibits, several of which travel around the world for several years, finally coming to rest at various places for permanent display. So the winner&rsquo;s hanging fees pay for the winning entries exposure via the traveling exhibits and publication in the annual &ldquo;Typography&rdquo;. Quite a bargain when on thinks of the monthly cost of a full-page ad in one of the design magazines.</p>
<p>@5star
If the sculpture is typographic in nature then enter it in Communications Design. If the sculpture is a set of letters that can be manipulated enter it into the Typeface Design.</p>
<p>The Typeface Design competition is exactly that, it is not a Font Software competition.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

Your layered entry sounds like a single entry, since individual pieces cannot exist by themselves.
If it is published/released in 2012 then it has to be entered this year. If you hold off  until 2013 then it should be entered next year.</p>
<p>My advice to you and all entrants is to make your entry samples look as good as you can and show off the typeface in its very best light. Over the years I&rsquo;ve seen so many entries fail because whoever put them together did the most minimum job. Just showing a character set is never going to get you very far, yet many entries do just that. A pity really.</p>
<p>And with that please refrain from the &ldquo;All entries should be on a common template and exactly the same&rdquo;. That was done the first year of the competition and I cannot tell you what a mind-numbing hell that was for the judges. The rules give the entrant wide latitude in creating the submission. If you are not a good typographer, by all means have a good typographer help you with the submission.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think entrants should be punished for not having great skills in <em>using</em> type (or not being able to get such help) because that&rsquo;s not what the award is for. So it might be good to provide a decent template (maybe even require it) but also allow entrants to add anything they want. FWIW this is how the Granshan competition does it.</p>

So what to do if the character set is large and you have a display font? There&rsquo;s simply no space on the one page of A3 format. So is it possible to take 2 pages for the style or should I show a reduced character set?

<p>My release isn&rsquo;t in my hands so that&rsquo;s why I was still not sure about this our next year, but yes I want to show it from it&rsquo;s best angle. Thankfully I have quite a few possibilities for specimen use.</p>
<p>I must add about the layering: It doesn&rsquo;t have to be layered, but it&rsquo;s an extra feature which broadens the usability of the typeface. In that regard I could agree it&rsquo;s an extra &lsquo;style&rsquo;. But since there is no change to the glyphs themselves except for which part is &lsquo;filled&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s still the same.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Graham, thank you for the answer, and could you also explain the procedure of payment, please? I haven&rsquo;t any credit card so I&rsquo;m going to make a money order. It is written in the rules that If payment is made by money order it must be drawn on a U.S. bank. I&rsquo;m not in the USA and does it mean that I have to find a department of a US bank in my city and send a payment to the TDC address (347 West 36th St. Suite 603 • New York NY 10018 USA)? Or should I send my order to some special US bank where TDC has an account (and then where to find out the requisites of it)? I can&rsquo;t understand it, please help to clear out. I want to be sure that my order will reach the right address.</div>

The books are thick, and mostly filled with graphic design work that is of no interest to me personally. I can&rsquo;t justify giving them bookshelf space, so donate most volumes to our local library, and send any containing my own work to my mother, the Hudson family archivist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to have a slim publication that just showed the winners of the type design competition each year, for which I would gladly find shelf space. Collectively, they would represent an important record of developing trends in type design over the past couple of decades.</p>

<p>Improved over what? The official release date of the family was November 2012. Earlier, beta versions of the roman and italic were available, but the formal release wasn&rsquo;t until the bold weights were added, and timed to coincide with the beginning of Brill&rsquo;s 330th anniversary celebrations at the Boerhaave Museum, 9 November 2012.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Brill started working with trial  versions of the roman and italic in Summer 2011, but their CEO didn&rsquo;t want to make any official release until the bold and bold italic weights were finished (with which I had help from Alice Savoie last year). So the finalised EULA, official website, etc. were all prepared for the launch of the anniversary celebrations last November. Unusually for a typeface design, Brill gave the project a lot of publicity while it was in progress, in their company reports and at book fairs and conferences, so that might be why it seems to have been around longer. It&rsquo;s been a part of my life since 2008!</div>

FWIW over the years I&rsquo;ve very rarely seen a winner that I for one thought didn&rsquo;t deserve it. But anyway if we all agreed on everything life would be dead.</p>
<p>That said, nobody/nothing is perfect, and to me it just seems to make sense to raise the entry fee by a few dollars to avoid charging the winners extra.</p>
<p>As an aside, to me it also makes sense to admit (at least to oneself) and thereby not defend (not even tacitly) the punishing, postal and ungracious behavior of a personal friend and/or someone with whom one merely shares a -perceived- antagonist.</p>

<p>Is that so? Subtracting the posts trolled in by the usual rebels-without-a-clue, folks who wanted answers came in, asked their questions, got responses and did their thing. I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s life&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And in turn you see nothing wrong with the way James has historically behaved, online in general and on Typophile in particular? Do you have zero space in your heart for even-handedness?</p>
<p>BTW if we assume that the TDC competition isn&rsquo;t perfect (since nothing is perfect) there&rsquo;s no way to know how it can be improved without engaging in discourse; you can never know who <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> get their answers, who ended up <em>not</em> submitting a worthy design. It&rsquo;s a classic delusion to accuse people who voice a complaint of being the only ones with that complaint. Specifically here I know for a fact that I&rsquo;m not the only one who thinks charging the winners extra is a bad idea; I&rsquo;m just the one of the few who sees value in bringing it up in public.</p>

<p>Its also worth pointing out that <em>you</em> &ndash; and I, for that matter &ndash; have no way to know everything that is involved in the reckoning of the TDC competition planning, finances, etc.. We don&rsquo;t know all the factors. We don&rsquo;t know what other options have been considered and rejected because they didn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>As a winner, I find the hanging fee is a minor element of the overall cost: very minor compared to the cost of producing the required panels and getting them delivered to the TDC. That is the real financial hit for winners, and one that entrants had better be aware of when making a submission.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re right that I/we don&rsquo;t know. Hence the usefulness of asking (and the value of transparency). For example two of my four points above have yet to be addressed, and there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m the only one wondering. Nobody should be very upset over unanswered questions in a case like this, but it remains a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>The hanging fee would be a minor/worthwhile expense for me too. And yes, entrants should be aware of it. But to me it still does more harm than good; it just seems mildly perverse to charge more to people whose work you think deserves recognition. So: is instead raising the entry fee by ~$8 worse or better?</p>
<p>BTW this isn&rsquo;t the biggest problem I see with this competition, it&rsquo;s just by far the easiest one to fix. You&rsquo;ve mentioned something worthwhile too: publishing the TDC2 results separately. I hope they consider that idea seriously (and don&rsquo;t attack you for voicing it).</p>

<p>[Special few]</p>
<p>So, chosen one, besides the unhidden hidden fee being less hidden, making the judges with whom you&rsquo;ve rarely disagreed spend more time, charging everyone more to enter, and hoping for improved perceptions of TDC by yourself and others now that James is no longer helping so domineeringly with the contest, and even if you are not even a member, and just want to stir up unwarranted distrust and suspicion using your freedom in public&hellip; you should write to Carol, who I&rsquo;m sure you know, because she might help you change things as a non-member type designer helping other non-member type designers more easily make up the rules to best help them enter this type design contest for the most benefit to themselves, and everyone else you represent. That is the &ldquo;value&rdquo; to which you refer, I hope.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to stir up anything except improvement in type, and I think the TDC and its competition play a big role in that. For a smart guy you sure can&rsquo;t figure me out.</p>
<p>Even stupid people know that the most effective way to put pressure (even positive pressure) on organizations/people is to do it in public. And my opinions are just ideas out there, no matter who I am, and whether I&rsquo;m a TDC member or not. Do you really believe that paying for membership makes people take you much more seriously? Do you take me seriously on the ATypI list? TDC membership isn&rsquo;t exactly the Scientology $100K requirement for going Level 2.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stir up anything except improvement in type, &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve been dealing your death chop insults in public to the TDC since the mid-90&rsquo;s? that&rsquo;s almost 15 years now&hellip; FWIW, BTW IMHO, that ain&rsquo;t workin'.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and I think the TDC and its competition play a big role in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great contest, but &ldquo;a big role&rdquo; is a baguette. And if you cut that baguette into the same number of pieces there are excellent typeface made per year, there are not enough crumbs to go around, by a long shot. So, I disagree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even stupid people know that the most effective way to put pressure (even positive pressure) on organizations/people is to do it in public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a difference between public pressure, and public insults. Like, if you call me stupid in private, that&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;d even welcome it. But when you say it in public, I tend take it more seriously. And if you really want to Effectively Pressure People in Public, you not only have to know what you&rsquo;re talking about, but you&rsquo;d better be right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that paying for membership makes people take you much more seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me? It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Read my post again, it was for you.</p>
