  target=\"_blank\">here is the wikipedia-entry</a> about it.\r\n\r\ni plan to release
  on of my fonts for free (its just a headline-font with a sovjet touch, not mouch
  really). but i dont want any a**h*** to be able to get profit out of it. so im comparing
  different possibilities.\r\n\r\ni dont have a lawyer and wont pay a lawyer to write
  me a good EULA, so i have to rely on already written stuff. so creative commons
  came to my mind, i read about it earlier.\r\n\r\nhas anybody of you experience with
  this? is there another good way you found out working for you?\r\n\r\nTHANKS!\r\n-thierry"

    it, no matter what you do. I have given up trying to get these morally bankrupt
    jerks from selling my freeware fonts on various compilation CDs because there
    are just to many people who consider other people's work found money.\r\n\r\nThe
    only people that ANY licensing arrangement is going to guarantee honesty of is
    HONEST people. The a**h***s don't care how well your EULA is worded; they will
    steal you blind at every opportunity."

    and ask the foundry if they'd be willing to let you use it. I think you'll find
    that most would be happy to share this with you - consolidating EULAs is something
    most designers see as a good thing. \r\n\r\nWhen Ascender's Bill Davis was at
    Agfa Monotype he went on the road offering AMT's EULA text to foundries - so Monotype
    Imaging may be a good place to start. \r\n\r\nWhatever you decide I'd recommend
    bringing the chosen EULA back here for a critique.\r\n \r\n"

    on their EULA and they asked what they should do. They had a EULA which they wanted
    to use but didn''t think they would get permission. I told them to ask. They asked
    and the answer was, "yes".  '
