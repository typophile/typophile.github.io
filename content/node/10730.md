    more the style of typography that&#39;s important. Mixing faces and what not.
    I mean, if you were trying to make something that looked &#39;Futurist&#39;, you&#39;d
    do well to just set each word in a different face. And not respect baselines. '

    <BR> <BR>I think that there are some definitive Futurist fonts. <BR> <BR>I believe
    that the Futurist&#39;s typographic goals included overall disruption of a page
    and a sense of unease. <BR> <BR>I think b.king&#39;s idea is a good solution as
    well. <BR> <BR>-smc <BR>

    respect baselines.</i> <BR> <BR>But not randomly. Futurist typography was all
    about reflecting the meaning of the words in the choice of colours, fonts, weights
    etc. It was also an attack on the norms of punctuation. <BR> <BR><i>... the Futurist&#39;s
    typographic goals included overall disruption of a page and a sense of unease.</i>
    <BR> <BR>Disruption of &#34;the bestial, nauseating idea of the book&#34; where
    the <i>mise en page</i> did not do justice to the emotional language of the text:  <BR>
    <BR><i>My revolution is aimed at the so-called typographical harmony of the page,
    which is contrary to the flux and reflux, the leaps and bursts of style that run
    through the page. On the same page, therefore, we will use three or four colours
    of ink, or even twenty different typefaces if necessary. For example: italics
    for a series of similar or swift sensations, boldface for violent onomatopoeias,
    and so on. With this typographical revolution and this multicoloured variety in
    the letters I mean to redouble the expressive force of words.</i>  <BR> <BR>From
    Marinetti&#39;s <i><b>Destruction of Syntax - Imagination without Strings - Words-in-Freedom</b></i>,1913. '

    resembles futurist work can be described and replicated easily. To create something
    that is more futurist, by virtue of it&#39;s reflection of futurist typographic
    ideals and dogma, the designer reflects the legacy of the movement, but the designer
    is then author. <BR> <BR>And if you want to be truly futurist, use after effects. '

    it&#39;s not going to really resemble Futurism if the &#39;look&#39; and the &#39;content&#39;
    aren&#39;t linked. And, to be honest, if you want to be truly Futurist you&#39;re
    a bit of an anachronism. <BR> <BR>M.
