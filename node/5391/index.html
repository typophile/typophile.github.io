  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Did you know that even guitar makers cared so much about letters? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We're making a custom bass guitar with an inlay in mother of pearl between the pickups on black. The inlay is in remembrance of the customer's mother, Kay. At first this didn't seem to be a difficult task, we inlay names all the time.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But Kay is especially difficult.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anything that looked &quot;pretty&quot; we encountered the descender of the y clashing with the K. Without any other contextual clues, many ideas looked like initials KAY.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is the original concept: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#1 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He generally liked it, but wanted the letters more on a baseline. So we proposed: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#2 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Didn't like the new y at all, but the rest he was satisfied with. So we tried a new one that he likes: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#3 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But now I need to make the final drawing for the inlay artist.  Before I plunk a few hours into the artwork, I'm looking for any suggestions. I'm especially bothered by the large difference in the negative spaces between the letters. It especially shows up in  a mock up with the materials: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many of the forms have to remain somewhat chunky to reduce the chance of snapping the shell while cutting with the saw. Ends can finish to a very sharp point, but a thin isthmus (like the bar on an A) is very fragile.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Mica, this is a fascinating process. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, some Suggestions: You may find that increasing the size of the A and Y helps generally. The other thing that I see, is that the Y doesn't really 'match'. Perhaps reshaping the Y would help. I would be tempted to try recalling the shape of the leg of the K or the bulgy left side of the A and applying it on the left arm of the Y or its tail. I also think that the A if made larger would create a nice spade shaped negative space with the foot of the K. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW: you'll find faster uptake if you need input about specifics if you post in Critique, but this shows process a lot so the cross-over is natural. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now some Questions, if you have the time: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just how large is a design like this? Must it fit between/in a fret (no I don't know the proper way to refer to this&hellip;) and just how wide is that? Do you have difficulty if a name or word exceeds a certain size i.e. William - would that have to be reduced to Will? Could you do William small enough to fit within a fret? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You mention that thin isthmus would present a problem, but sharp points are fine. Can you share the reason for this? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the hand drawn curviness is neat, especially when I imagine it in the context of a curvy guitar. I like the hint of Rolling Stone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your input, Jon. The y has been the stumbling block on this project. None of us at the shop are happy with it either, so at least I'm glad to know we're not alone in our opinion. Back to the drawing board! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Critique area seems more specifically gears toward font creation, and so I wasn't sure where it would fit in there, but yes, I notice that region gets alot more attention.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The design has to fit between the pickups on a bass guitar. It's sort of an unusual location. This area is about 2 inches high and 5 inches wide. It's placed under the strings where the player's right hand plucks the strings.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Depending on where we put the inlay, there are limitations on size. A common place to put a decorative inlay is the 12th fret - it's the center of the string and marks the octave. It's a small space, typically only 5/8 x 2 inches on a guitar and 7/8 x 2-1/4 inches on a 4-string bass. You can't go to the edges, the designs look better with a buffer sround them. You have to consider where the string will fall once they're installed too.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If a name or other personalization would be too big to inlay, we  engrave mother of pearl scrimshaw style. That allows finer detail than you can do in a regular inlay.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sharp points aren't a problem since after we saw the inlay, it's filed smooth. You can do some amazing things with tiny files. Here's a picture of Mike filing a Roman numeral I: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These are some of the Roman numeral inlays temporarily mounted before actually inlaying them in the fingerboard: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Little thin places are prone to cracking. Either in sawing, filing, handling or glue-in. This is an example of one that cracked on installation: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Can't win 'em all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mica <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your project is very appealing, both as a type project and an instrument. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have you tried: tilting the downstoke of the A just slightly off the vertical toward the Y and then swelling the downstroke of the Y to make more of a U shape. This would help to reduce the neg space between the two letters. I don't find the neg sapce between K and A to much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am an amateur jazz cornet player, and I love working with wood, so I sort of fell into starting to build a steel string acoustic guitar. I don't know how to play the guitar, but I didn't see that as any reason not to make one. I will see if I can learn how to play basic rhythm once it's finished. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My point: you might consider getting your hands on a small pantographic engraving machine. The manual models are now quite cheap, since the industry is switching to computer assisted models. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The advantage to the pantograph is that you can work large to start. Your tight pencil drawing is photocopied into a good quality Strathmore 2-ply bristol, and you cut it out cleanly with a sharp X-Axto knife. You can save the negative area and this becomes the pattern fpr the sink that you will be cutting. Both parts are pasted to a thick matte board as separate pieces; positive and negative. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These two are traced witha stylus on the panto as whatever reduction you require, and you cut about 1/64&quot; in depth into a good rigid material like aluminum plate or some workable metal. This is the working pattern. You make a working pattern for both the sink and the inlay material. If you use the same sized cutter for both patterns, they will be very accurate and precise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Once you have the two working patterns made, these fit onto the pantograph separately and you then make the sink in the guitar material, whether it's wood or phenolic or whatever. Next you angrave the inlay material using the same cutter and the fit is perfect. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To make it stable and unmoving the inlay material is glued to heavy laminated chipboard with white glue and left to dry a few hours. Ths piece goes on the panto for cutting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you are finsished you can lift the inlay by soaking until it releases from the cardboard material. If you want a little loosensess to the fit of the sink and the inlay this can be done by tweaking the size of the stylus that you use when cutting the sink, and the hole will come out a few thou, more open to let the inlay pop in so that it is not so tight as to crack when you are apressing it in. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've tried this with some rigid plstic in place of the abalone that I intend to use, and it cuts ok but it could be a little less gummy for better results. Pearl or abalone should cut very cleanly. With this method you can have considerably finer lines (the cross stroke in the A in KAY). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You will not lose the handmade feeling in you work by doing it this way, it will just give you work more refinement. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If this is not too nutty for you, email me and I will give you some leads on what to look for and where. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way; if you look up the ATypI 2004 on the web you will see a photospread that John Hudson did on my cutting of the keepsake for the Conf. This will give you some idea of the process if you are not familiar with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I find it nice that so many of us do other things along with typography, and that makes this Forum so much more fun than simply talking shop. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agreed Jon, this is a cool thread. Love inlay work! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim, your advice about the AY is a great. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mica, in addition, consider ending the left leg of the A at the baseline. That will better frame the design between the swash leg of the K and the tail of the Y.

		<div class="commentbody">Jim - not one of my immediate family members play guitar, and we've been making these for almost 35 years now. Heck, I'm no typographer, and I still play with letters <!-- raw HTML omitted --> After playing piano for close to 20 years, I'm finally branching out to a bass guitar. Feel free to email any questions about building to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And thank you for your suggestions. Your advice is appreciated. My dad will surely want to investigate the pantographic engraver more. I've tried to follow your advice, and I look forward to any other comments. While there is improvement, I'm sure I'm not quite finished:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I really like the way Randy's suggestion for ending the A at the baseline ended up.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm trying hard to clean it up, but not lose the funky hand drawn aspect and the original character of my mom's letters.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon - when something breaks on install, we have to explain to the customer about the upcoming delay. In the case above, he decided it was so minor he wanted to keep it the way it was. That inlay is only about an inch across (and it's under the strings). Otherwise, it must be removed with a rotary cutter and a new inlay gets made. There can be casualties all along the way.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We almost always hand letter the designs. We might start with a font to get some general proportions, but since we're custom making everything, we figure even the lettering should be unique and reflect the individual we're making it for. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The most common inlay is initials. This is KP in Elvish: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The oval is a sterling silver wire and the letters are cut from mother of pearl.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in this design, the customer's initials DE were incorporated with a bass clef: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He sent in a rough sketch of his idea, then we worked it to the final design. The oval is ebony with sterling silver wire. The bass clef is golden mother of pearl. The E and the stem of the D are  black Tahitian mother of pearl.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just about everyone here is considered a designer. My mom, Susan, is the lead designer. On a given project, we toss around ideas until we figure who will be best suited to do the design, and to execute the inlay itself. I usually get type related projects since that's a special interest of mine.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We have been commissioned to exuecute other artist's designs, but we still need to adapt them to suit the medium. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks again for the questions and suggestions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hopefully you'll get to see the completed letters here: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These are just arranged on an unfinished piece of ebony. I need to work out the final spacing still. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mike was the artist who cut the letters from the shell. He really liked cutting the upper left curl on the &quot;y&quot; best, but it took 3 attempts before he got a letter without a fracture. The first one broke at the upper right, the second had an unseen defect at the bottom of the bowl. The third came out great.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sally, that space has been bugging me ever since I started this project. Any attempts I've made have made to fill that space made the overall look too &quot;frilly&quot; for both my taste and the customer's. We swung the vertical of the a out slightly towards the y and it did help some.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, the suggestion for a complimentary negative space is interesting. There already is a good sized space at the top of the &quot;Ka&quot;, but it's not demanding enough attention to counter the open space on the &quot;ay&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even though the shell is already cut, I'm going to explore this a bit further (after TypeCon!) to see if I can get an even better solution before we actually sink the shell in the wood. I won't mind having an extra &quot;a&quot; around if I can fidn something better for this project.</div>
