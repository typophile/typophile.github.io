    its name with Cyrillic and Greek characters ('omikron' for 'o', 'rho' for 'p',
    Cyrillic 's' for 'c') in <em>every possibly</em> configuration! The race is on
    -- who's first to claim \"\u2133\uFF49\u0441r\u24AA\u222B\u25EF\u2109\u03C4\"?"

  body: "I think it's a huge step forward, but it will now be hard to remember some
    things.\r\n\r\nresumeplanet.com and r\xE9sum\xE9planet.com are pronounced the
    same, but could be totally different websites.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the most part,
    all websites are now somewhat readable by english speakers because of the latin
    alphabet.  This will do a much better job at sorting geographic interest sites
    than using country coded TLDs.\r\n\r\nA step sideways maybe.  Arguably forward,
    arguably backward, but certainly progress in some direction for sure!"
