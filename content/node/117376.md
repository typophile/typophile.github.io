  target=\"new50\">British Library</a> has a ton of amazing scans of 19th century
  text & illustrations on Flickr. They're fascinating to browse through but also incredibly
  useful since by now they're all well into the public domain. Some of the illustrations
  are just begging to be used by amateur poster designers, and there's plenty of treasures
  for font artists looking for ideas and a HUGE challenge! (I highly doubt anything
  close to many of these hand-lettered titles exists in digital typeface form)\r\n\r\nSo
  far one of my absolute favorites is this old book cover, I would kill for a font
  like the one used in the main title!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated.jpg\">\r\n\r\nAnd
  the old comic / story book covers have a wealth of friendlier, informal type designs:\r\n\r\n<img

  antique custom-letters or typefaces that make you drool?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    commercial appeal and the resources required to make such a font exceed that which
    one could afford to put into it, timewise, except for very large firms such as
    Monotype.\r\n\r\nI agree they are beautiful and I love looking at them, but for
    the most part the \"fonts\" on those old ornate covers are actually engravings,
    not type."

  body: Yeah, I know they're mostly engraved / carved / drawn on a one-off basis.
    But with so many new independent designers, hobbyists and amateurs out there with
    the ability to design from their laptops in their pajamas, I think ornate fonts
    have more commercial appeal now than ever. But I'm no expert. I'm going to try
    and take a crack at, very least, designing a band logo based on that Pennsylvania
    text. Maybe I can even make it into a font.
