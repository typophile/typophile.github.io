  body: "You're kidding, right? That's not a typeface, but three very ordinary-looking
    molded plastic letters, garishly striped. The letter shapes themselves have no
    particularly distinguishing characteristics, with the minor exception of the leg
    on the letter 'R', which serves only to eliminate typefaces with curved legs and
    legs that connect at the intersection. Not to mention the built-in neon tubing.\r\n\r\n
