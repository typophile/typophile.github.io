body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nas a type amateur and enthusiast, I've always been
  very interested in the history of type. Recently, after a lot of browsing on this
  site, I found numerous references to a certain 'Vox ATypI' classification of typefaces,
  and that sparked my interest. After a long search on the internet all I could find
  were pages in French regarding this classification, and my French isn't quite up
  to par, so I wasn't able to read those pages.\r\n\r\nMy question to you is if anyone
  knows a site in English (or Dutch) that explains the Vox ATypI classification, or
  can someone maybe post a short summary in English about the classification?\r\n\r\nThank
  you kindly,\r\n\r\nWouter Spaak\r\nNijmegen, The Netherlands"

    translation seems to work quite well for most of this (admittedly basic), hope
    it helps.\r\nTim"

  body: If you look at the wikipedia page about the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_Vox-Atypi">Vox-ATypI
    classification</a> you should be able to see the similarities of the words. Even
    for someone such as myself, who doesn't speak French, the words are familiar.

  body: "Thank you both very kindly, the Google translation thingy actually worked
    a lot better than I'd hoped. The last time I used an online translater was years
    ago in the days of Altavista Babelfish, and that was usually rubbish.\r\n\r\nThank
    you Miss Tiffany for the French Wikipedia entry, with a big dictionary and some
    imagination it proved very useful as well."

    errors, please feel free to correct them.'
