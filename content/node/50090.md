  new interest in letters and words at twenty-seven months of age. I started off using
  Chapparal then began to entertain other, wildly different, thoughts like Cronos
  and Century. I recently saw a children's book set in Licko's Journal Light that
  looked wonderful.\r\n\r\nI realized that, unlike most projects, I wasn't sure on
  what I was basing my choices. What are the criteria that define a good font for
  young children learning their letters and eventually to read? Now, my son is clearly
  a genius of towering proportions, but let's limit the discussion to children in
  general.\r\n\r\nI have some thoughts on the matter, but I'd prefer to open it up
  and see where this goes. It's a fairly interesting topic in that the point and priorities
  of the uses of the font are distinct from more typical text, display, or whathaveyou
  faces."

  body: "Camp #3) Use EVERYthing but Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nI do think that there may
    be a point to using either multiple fonts or, more elegantly, a font with alternate
    letters (almost like the original Beowulf program). Kids may learn a letter best
    by seeing various glyphs for a given letter so that, by seeing what is constant
    and what isn't, they can arrive at the \"essence\" of a letter."

  body: "After having designed 7 or 8 titling faces and doing many covers for a NY
    publisher of children's book I decided to design a thoughtful juvenile font that
    would speak to the time that I had spent with my children reading books. Two years
    ago I released Peanut through P22. Although one cannot have a favorite child this
    face definitely ignites the child in me. It may be less formal than what you are
    looking for but, what the heck, take a peek. It was truly a face born out of a
    dad's love for his children and their appreciation of their father's letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Peanut_3438.png]\r\n\r\nDon't
    get me wrong, this is not a shameless plug. Just a reaction to the same sort of
    love that I have for my children... 23, 21, and 10. Maybe it is just dad reminiscing
    through type and lettering.\r\n\r\nAre we getting old or what?\r\n\r\nMichael"

    it? Playfulness?  High legibility?\r\n\r\nI like the balance you struck of a being
    freshly drawn with some classic shapes and serif forms. "

  body: "Christian,\r\n\r\nMy son is just a few months older than yours and also very
    interested in letters - to my delight.\r\nAs a designer I'm of the everything
    but Comic Sans school.\r\n\r\nI find that at that the really geometric fonts seem
    to work well - such as Futura etc - as they tend to come closest to what we think
    of the basic form of specific glyphs.\r\n\r\nAnd while he can recognize certain
    letters in almost any font as long as they are uppercase, he has yet to grasp
    the concept of lowercase letters - in other words that there are two types of
    ABCs or more.\r\n\r\nAnd numbers for now are also called \"letters\".\r\n\r\nMichael
    - nice typeface - like the name too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"What were you aiming for when you first drew it?\"\r\n\r\nPure fun, simplicity
    (laced with a nod to the Roman forms) and a sense of the sparkle that I saw in
    my children's eyes when they looked at letters from early on. It is derived from
    a logo, and when I started lettering it I asked my kids  which shapes they liked
    in certain letters. I commandeered the caps so they may not be as much fun, oh
    well. I did not expect the reaction in the publishing industry, some of my clients
    used it instead of having me do lettering. What was I thinking :-)\r\n\r\nTo this
    day the/my favorite letter is the lowercase e. Kid like goofy!\r\n\r\nMichael"
