body: I recently had a conversation with a teacher of mine while sitting in a bar
  filled with hand painted signs.  His father was a sign painter back in the day and
  I found a lot of his little stories interesting about the development of type and
  letterforms within that trade. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of some solid sources on
  sign painting or the history of type through that method? <BR> <BR>Any help is appreciated.
