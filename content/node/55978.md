body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI used this font as part of a basic thankyou card some months ago.
  And wishing to fiddle with it in photoshop and illustrator converted it to outlines.\r\n\r\nI
  only really have three letters spelling the word \"you\", but its quite a distinctive
  font so I'm relatively hopeful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thankyou_5407.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  \"thank\" is Clarendon, that one I know\r\n\r\nThe 'o' has short blunt \"spikes\"
  under where the flowers are and the hole of the 'o' is usually slightly smaller,
  but I've increased it to allow for an image to be inserted.\r\n\r\nThe exclamation
  mark is also included, but minus its point which is replaced by the heart. I can't
  be sure, but I think this was a straight circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yu_6009.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is the y and u on their own. The u really does have that slash in between the uprights
  as part of the font.\r\n\r\nSorry there's not much to go on, but please can someone
  help.\r\n"
