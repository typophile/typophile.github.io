body: "I am facing a problem in my Arabic font,  please help me if there is any solution.
  The problem is shown in the image below. When the kaf comes in the beginning of
  a line or in the start of a paragraph than the slanted stroke of kaf appears a little
  outward towards right side as compared to other characters. As appearing in the
  middle line of the image in red colour, the kaf stroke is crossing the right side
  boundary. \r\n\r\nYes, I have made the kaf slanted stroke outside the glyph right
  metrics similar to the image but I want any possible solution for it like kerning
  or alternate glyph. Is it possible to apply kerning to a specific letter or use
  alternate shape for it whenever that letter falls in the beginning of a line or
  paragraph, not in all situations.  \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5829.jpg]"

  body: "I claim no special expertise, but this looks like an instance where you should
    invoke the <strong>init</strong>\u2014initial forms\u2014feature, since line breaks
    and paragraph starts are part of the document structure code and not of the font
    itself.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you might want to consider a contextual alternate,
    too, for instances where the kaf appears after a space."

  body: "I'd say that visually this is better than the alternative (introducing a
    big white space to the right under the top of kaf. Optically, the margins are
    better aligned by allowing parts of some letters to intrude on the margins than
    by allowing white space to intrude into the text.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to affect
    this by kerning, you can do so contextually by increasing the right side spacing
    of the kaf glyph EXCEPT when preceded by any other glyph (including the wordspace
    glyph). Note, however, that this will also affect the kaf when it occurs at the
    beginning of any text run, e.g. change of font, change of direction."

    Anyway, think: if you really care of the Kaf going outwards, why wouldn''t you
    worry of Meem, going inwards? Certain amount of "problems" gives special flavour,
    some kind of versimilitude to this sort of typefaces.'

  body: "It means this looks better as described by John Hudson and Froo. Visually
    it also looks to me better but some times I I got confused so decided to ask here.
    I should leave it as it is.\r\n\r\nThanks."
