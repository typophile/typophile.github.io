body: "I am working on a rather comprehensive font containing various alphabets; Cyrillic,
  Georgian, Greek, Vietnamese, Arabic, Thai etc.\r\n\r\nCertain duplicate glyhps appear
  when viewed in 'Index' mode which don't appear in 'Name', 'Unicode ranges' or 'Codepages'
  modes. I think that these duplicates are causing FL to crash when I try to generate,
  but if I delete them I get a message saying there are missing glyphs _60 _61 _62
  etc.\r\n\r\nExtra glyphs inside red line:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Indexextras_3760.gif]\r\n\r\nFatal
  output warning;\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/64751\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have
  an idea of how to remedy this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "_60 _61 _62 etc. are glyph names which are used somewhere in OT features
    or in classes. So after you rename them in classes or code you will be able to
    delete duplicates in the font. There is the special Replace Name feature in the
    OT panel:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReplaceName_6163.jpg]"
