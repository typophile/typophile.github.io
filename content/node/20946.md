body: "I have been working with the Kievit family for about three monts, but since
  the last week I can\xB4t get all of the styles listed on the Adobe CS2 applications,
  I can only get  about the half of the styles and sometimes they appear with a wrong
  name (I choose  medium SC and I get bold italic). I can get the 23 styles to appear
  on Word, but they appear with wrong names.\r\n\r\nI deactivated and reactivated
  them with Font Explorer X several times, also cleaned the font caches with it and
  replaced the files used by Font Explorer with a back up copy in case they could
  be corrupted but nothing works.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?"

    use the folder that's exclusive to Adobe apps (I think the path is: library:application
    support:adobe:fonts -- it's the one that also contains the Req'd Adobe fonts."

  body: "If you're using Mac OS 10.4 you can clear your system font caches simply
    by deleting the following folder:\r\n/Library/Caches/com.apple.ATS/\r\nWhen you
    drag it to the trash you will be prompted for your administrative password. You
    should then immediately restart. The folder will be regenerated when ATSServer
    restarts. That pretty much resets the Mac OS side. \r\n\r\nI'm not aware of Adobe
    applications ever caching anything more than lists of fonts. In older applications
    AdobeFnt.lst files held some of this data. You could try doing a Spotlight search
    for them and deleting them as well. \r\n\r\nYou could also test removing your
    InDesign preferences folder as a test to see if that makes any difference. Obviously,
    you would want to restart InDesign after each test. "

  body: "I made it all, but it's not working. I finally cleaned all chaces, used the
    backup font files, unistalled all font managing applications, installed the fonts
    in the sistem folder and restarted several times.\r\n\r\nI installed the fonts
    on another machine and they worked fine, then made an illustrator file with a
    small text sample of every font style of the family and opened it on my computer.\r\n\r\nIllustrator
    recognized the fonts and then I could work with all of the styles until I restarted
    the computer, then all was lost. When I do this I can work with most of the font
    styles on Indesign but four of them.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is happening? everyting
    worked fine until the last week.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
