  body: "Hi Oystein, you probably didn't know -- so no harm done -- but there's an
    unwritten rule at Typophile that you can't link to rip-offs or pirated copies
    of commercially available fonts. I edited out the names in your post (probably
    way too late, but what the heck).\r\n\r\nCould you please make sure not to do
    that anymore in the future? Thanks. :-)"
