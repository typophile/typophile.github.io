body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nfor an exhibition, that will be partly in 3 languages, german,
  english an hebrew, I need some help with the right choice of a hebrew font that
  goes well with <a href=\"http://www.type.co.uk/index.php?p=a_to_z&search=chevin\">Chevin</a>.
  \ We use Chevin demibold for the quotes within the interviewtext. The german original
  in demibold, the english translation in demibold italic an for the hebrew translation
  we are not sure yet.\r\nThe fonts that actually look well are probably the comic
  sans of hebrew typography, and we don\xB4t know it. You understand our problem:
  I don\xB4t have an idea what we are doing to someones eyes reading the texts, if
  choosing one of those:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=sweeta\">Sweeta</a>\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/sean-mf/\">Sean</a>\r\n\r\nWhat would
  you suggest? \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for some help in this tricky situation.\r\n\r\n"

    you can see some really rough and and dirty screenshots of matching tests.\r\nfirst
    two different weights of \"pausa\" from yanek Iontef, then sean, then pronto and
    then sweeta. \r\nPausa works well, doesn\xB4t it? \r\nMaybe the Hebrew should
    be set a bit bigger than the x-height of Chevin.\r\n"

    is a weird blend of `square' and `script' styles and is slower to read&mdash;but
    the height & weight of the letters in the sample is well-night perfect complement
    to the English.\r\n&emsp;Can you get hold of some Israeli comic books for comparison?\r\n\u2014Joel"

    you could also look at his [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lighthouse/shirah-joie/|Shirah
    Joie]] typeface, which is somewhat of a match, though you might want more rounded
    terminals. Following Stehen's idea, I am sure David could on commission produce
    a font that is a match and very readable also...

    lecture tell his story of attempting  Hebrew. He said that at he first thought,
    \"How hard can it be with just 22 letters?\" After the eighth try, with none of
    his efforts working in his eyes, he gave up. "

  body: "Thank you for the ideas! As the time and the budget won\xB4t allow us to
    comission a font, we have to see, what font is matching to the existing exhibition
    design. When we made the exhibition about \"Jewish Youth in Germany Today\" 3
    years ago, to be shown in New York and then in Germany, we couldn\xB4t imagine
    it being shown again and again and even in Israel one day. So no font was chosen
    that allowes hebrew from beginning on. But it would be great Nick, if you take
    the challenge to widen the Chevin-family! I\xB4m sure it\xB4s not the last time
    we have to \"upgrade\" the whole thing languagewise.\r\n \r\nShirah Joie works
    very well too, we had that font in the very first list, even before posting here.
    We had the first impression, that it is too heavy, compared to Chevin, but that
    was wrong. A very close match so far, but just with one weight! \r\nNow we found
    Pauza, from Yanek Iontef, with rounded terminals, 4 weights and we are very happy
    how it works with Chevin. \r\n\r\nCheck <a href=\"http://juedischejugendheute.ag.htwg-konstanz.de/look/fontsfinal.html\">here</a>
    for some screenshots and an image of the whole thing in on language only.\r\n\r\nI
    couldn\xB4t get hold of some Israeli comic books yet, but I soon will in TelAviv.
    \r\nIt is interresting and challanging to work with non-Latin alphabets, I\xB4m
    glad for the experience with Hebrew!\r\n"
