  body: "The sample is too small indeed...\r\nbut it looks like <strong>[[http://opti.netii.net/fonts-p/index.htm|Peninsular
    Script Three]]</strong> from OPTI\r\nAs it's noted on the OPTI Archive page bellow,
    the original font was <strong>Penhand Three</strong>:\r\nhttp://opti.netii.net/fonts-p/index.htm"

  body: "Using an \"orphan font\" like the ones from the defunct OTPI foundry raises
    legal issues, even where, as in the case of this one, the font seems to be an
    original digitization by OPTI rather than a pirated clone of digital work by another
    fontmaker. Probably no problem for personal use but for anything commercial I
    recommend consulting a lawyer.\r\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer. This merely a
    layman's opinion and does not constitute legal advice.\r\nDon"

  body: 'Castcraft/OPTI started out as a metal type business in Chicago - they according
    to them - made digital fonts from the Castcraft metal types they originally sold.
    The whole question of orphan fonts from defunct foundries is interesting. '
