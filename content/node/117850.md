  body: "Actually I'm looking for a fraktur specifically. I find blackletter strangely
    beautiful (I say \"strangely\" because typically I admire legibility, and blackletter
    tends away from that ideal) but I have real difficulty classifying them into one
    of the four major families. (And then there are modern blackletters, which sometimes
    don't fit into any of them!) Part of my hope is that by looking at designs with
    certain constraints (like the monowidth or monoline mentioned) then I would better
    be able to identify the elements that are essential to that style. I'm still trying
    to learn about their history, as the difference between historical and contemporary
    letter forms, for example, still throws me. It can be hard to compare apples to
    apples.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I like to include a healthy range of math symbols
    in my own designs, and I'm never able to make fitting \u212D/\u210C/\u2111/\u211C/\u2128
    because I don't understand them.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I'm looking for blackletter
    specimens to study, starting with fraktur. If someone has developed their own
    mnemonic system for quickly classifying blackletters, I'd be all ears."

    by Georg Seifert:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThis modernized blackletter started out
    in 2006 as a graduation project at the Bauhaus-Universit\xE4t Weimar. Georg Seifert
    tried to answer the question how Fraktur typefaces would have looked like today,
    if they hadn\u2019t fallen out of fashion. In Georg\u2019s hands, the old Teutonic
    letterforms had to undergo the same stylistic shifts and transformations as Roman
    typefaces did: less ornamentation, a simplified construction, and a drastically
    reduced contrast. The result is a \u201Cgrotesque\u201D monolinear blackletter,
    Rostrot, and its \u201Cseriffed\u201D sister style with some contrast, RosenRot.
    The fonts were never officially published, but come bundled with Judith Schalansky\u2019s
    book Fraktur Mon Amour. \u2014 <a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/uses/3385/grimms-maerchen-ohne-worte-by-frank-floethman\">Fonts

    my question.\r\nLooks like a generally successful design concept for a monoline
    Fraktur.\r\nMost letters , particularly the lower case, except for the usual problem
    with _k_ and _w_, would seem to work well for readers unfamiliar with Fraktur.
    The uppercase resolves some problems, but still has ambiguities for readers unfamiliar
    with Fraktur. Some examples:  _D_ and _O_, _K_ and _R_, _C_ and _S_. BTW, _G_
    would make a good logo for Twitter.\r\nIn my opinion, for whatever it is worth,
    the font could be improved if it provided some alternate versions of the problematic
    letters. Unlike most Fraktur, this one could work particularly well in low resolution
    situations. \r\nDon\r\n"
