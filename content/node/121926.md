body: "Found this font when looking for something that would look good for a decking
  company. The image shows 2 different styles of the same font family.\r\nOriginally
  came across \"Black Ops One\" font which is similar and then found this which I
  liked better.  I was even able to download a pdf with all the different versions
  of this font which I can't find anymore. I seem to remember the font name had something
  to do with a brand name, maybe automotive related? Any help is appreciated.\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6209.jpg]"
