  body: "I found the shape at the bottom to be confusing. At first I thought it was
    a face wearing glasses, with the dot being the mouth, but the attached key made
    no sense. After staring at it a minute I saw a wind-up mouse, with the dot being
    the eye. If it's a mouse then a tail would help.\r\n\r\n> My company name is Quirky
    Lab\r\n\r\nSorry, don't see \"lab\" in the shape."

    guess my first suggestion would be to have a think about what your logo communicates
    to people, and if this is how you want to be seen. To me the logo comes across
    as being basic and simple, almost like a child's toy, which isn't necessarily
    a bad thing, if that's what you're going for."
