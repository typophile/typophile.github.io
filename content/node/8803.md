body: I had posted this in the General Discussions area, but someone suggested I post
  here as well.... <BR> <BR>Is there any word on the current status of FontLab/FontStudio
  5? I read in a number of places that release was targeted for late 2004, but I haven&#39;t
  seen anything recent. Sorry if I just missed it, but I&#39;d really like to know
  where FontLab is now.  <BR> <BR>Adam, is there anything you can tell us?

    I hope that&#39;s the case.

  body: Adam has said elsewhere that it will definitely be in 2005. <BR> <BR>As a
    beta tester, I can attest that it will be worth waiting for. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: FontLab Studio 5 for Windows is in beta and will be released in the first
    quarter of 2005. We also plan to release some other new applications very soon,
    so stay tuned! As for ScanFont 4 for Windows -- well, as I&#39;ve stated elsewhere,
    we&#39;re not a huge company with unlimited resources. This   is why we rarely
    have the capacity to release the same application on both platforms paralelly.
    ScanFont 4 for Windows had to give way FontLab Studio 5. All I can say is that
    we do have a new version of ScanFont for Windows in the works, but we don&#39;t
    have a release date yet.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.

  body: Thank you for the official word, Adam. After seeing some of the discussions
    about FontLab Studio 5 here at Typophile, I am really looking forward to working
    with it.

  body: Support for Hebrew nikud and te&#39;amim would be dependent on an update of
    the Adobe OpenType FDK code that FontLab uses, so will not be in FontLab Studio
    5. In the meantime, you can always use VOLT.
