  the font itself. What I'm looking for is a font I know I've seen recently that mimics
  this style -- points of light/ink, some of which are brighter/wider than others.
  A super-simplified bit-map, in other words. Also, I don't recall if this was actually
  an alphabetic font or not; it may have just been abstract patterns of this style.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
  this was a kind of display used in very early mainframe computers (EDSAC, in this
  case), but searching for it along those lines hasn't yielded anything yet. \r\n\r\nThis
  is just right on the tip of my tongue. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n"
