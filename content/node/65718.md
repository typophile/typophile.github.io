    to me. It's only $20 but you could always check out DaFont.com...you might be
    able to find a free knockoff.

    your suggestion, as this is for his daughter's website, but we really prefer original
    freeware/shareware fonts over pirated commercial fonts. So either find a free
    alternative that's really close, or license G\xE1bor K\xF3thay's original. But
    don't use stolen fonts."

  body: "@Bald Condensed\r\n\r\nI understand and totally agree with you. I'm not suggesting
    he use a stolen font. I only meant he may find something out there that is close
    in feeling and legitimately free. My recommendation is that for $20 he buy the
    original. \"Knock off\" was a poor choice of words on my part."

    I hope that's a good thing. :^)\r\n\r\nMy first comment should remind you of a
