  configure widely spaced titles on top of each other.\r\n\r\nIn the attached example
  I'm showing 2 methods. The first uses a consistent letter spacing but a variable
  size to achieve a justified look, and the second uses consistent size but variable
  letter spacing to achieve the same result.\r\n\r\nAre there any rules governing
  this or is it left up to the designer?"

    not consistent like I originally posted... you don't want to have rivers... which
    are already very noticeable in your example.\r\n\r\nFont Size and Weight can vary
    though. "

    caps, and I'd add that's especially helpful when using a sans. The relationship
    between the letters on different lines may be graphically interesting, but the
    proximity results in visual confusion for a person attempting to read it. Which
    is more important to you and the client?\r\n\r\nThe tracking should remain loose,
    although I agree that it should be tighter.\r\n\r\nThe rest, I think, is subjective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of nonsense I threw together to illustrate my point, but you've really cleared
    this up for me.\r\n\r\nCheers! "
