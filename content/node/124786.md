  body: "The only legitimate font I can find is Americana Extra Bold Condensed [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmericanaExtraBoldCondensedAsBEHRENS_5983.jpg]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/americana/\r\nThe font known as Atlantic Inline
    is an edited Americana.\r\nIf this is for anything other than personal use, you
    should add your own inline highlight effect.\r\nDon\r\n"
