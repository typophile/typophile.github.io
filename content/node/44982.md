body: "I was wondering if there were any solutions to make an image out of a text
  file. Like an ASCII image, but with real text and variations in font size and weight.
  Is there any commercial solutions for this, or any scripts for Scriptographer etc?

  body: "Most ASCII generators aren't what you're looking for at all. There's this
    http://www.typorganism.com/asciiomatic/ one which does generate ASCII images,
    but can also change the darkness of the letters if you tell it to do it in colour;
    however it doesn't change the weights or anything. But it's kiiinda close to what
    you want - perhaps you could put your image through this and then exaggerate parts
    of it by hand by changing weights and type sizes\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "That was surprisingly difficult to write. Sampling a picture (a recognizable
    one, at this very low rez) is easy. So is drawing text at arbitrary sizes -- I'm
    using the FreeType lib for that. The difficulty came in when I tried to emulate
    the sizing; FreeType allows that, but it took a bit of fiddling to get it right
    (sort of).\r\n\r\nMy program resembles an ASCII art generator, but instead of
    selecting characters for darkness, it selects one of 5 weights of Myriad, so the
    'effective' gray resolution is just 5 levels. I do hope you can recognize the
    image, though!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/einstein_6170.png]"

    runs different.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the text is not broken at whole words -- that's
    quite a bit more work, although it should be doable --, but it <em>is</em> fully
    justified.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/einstein2_5932.png]"

    used it for the above samples to get the character metrics (the important part),
