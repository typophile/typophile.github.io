  of using typefaces.\r\n\r\nLet's say I use Adobe CS to design a poster/brochure/logo
  for a company, for which I will be paid. Can I use any of the fonts installed on
  my Mac (such as Futura, Helvetica, Hoefler ...) without any issues or should either
  the client or the designer (me) purchase a licence for the specific usage of the
  chosen font?\r\n\r\nEssentially, can all the fonts that come with the OS or the
  design software be used for any reason?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>Can I use any of the fonts installed on my Mac</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAdobe
    applications generally install a number of fonts in the Library/Fonts folder depending
    on how you have configured the installation. For example, [[http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/fontinstall/cs6installedfonts.html|Adobe
    CS6 installs a variety of fonts depending on which applications and combination
    of applications are installed]]. The license typically permits you to use the
    bundled fonts with the application to produce documents in line with the capabilities
    of that application.\r\n\r\nOther fonts installed as standard with your operating
    system are licensed in line with the operating system and its standard application
    software, which does not cover third party applications, such as Adobe's CS6 suite.
    As such I would assume (though I am not asserting) that you would require a separate
    commercial license in order to use those fonts as part of an Adobe CS workflow.
    Annoyingly no real distinction is made in Adobe's (or any other applications)
    font menus and so it is left to the user to understand licensing restrictions
    and make that judgement."

  body: Karl -- I have never heard of anyone needing an additional license to use
    the fonts supplied with OS X just because the app running on the OS and using
    them was not made by Apple.  I think in that case at least, which is what jai
    is asking about, your assumption is not correct.

  body: "Tom, I am referring specifically to content generated for commercial output
    but if you have information to the contrary that would be great as I have always
    found the OS EULAs frustratingly non-specific and as such taken a cautionary approach.
    Additionally, the versions of fonts distributed with an OS often differ from those
    available commercially and as such can cause problems when working with third
    parties.\r\n"

  body: "Generally speaking, font licenses permit the things that fonts are normally
    used for (documents, brochures, posters, etc). I believe that fonts that come
    with the operating system or with Adobe CS tend to have few restrictions, other
    than the obvious one that you can't give copies of the fonts to other people.\r\n\r\nSome
    fonts can't be embedded in PDFs and you'll get an error message when you try to
    make it. I believe it's because they were concerned that someone might extract
    the font from the PDF. I think most designers would avoid buying fonts that have
    that restriction since PDFs are a common way to email layouts and proofs to clients,
    but if that happens on a job and you can't switch fonts, just save it in another
    format. \r\n\r\nSome fonts may also carry specific restrictions, such as you can't
    use them in logos. Just read the font license to be sure.\r\n"

    told someone who is creating content for commercial output using OS X fonts that
    he needs to buy an additional font license if he wants to use InDesign instead
    of Pages.
