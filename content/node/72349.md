  this font.\r\n\r\nThe closest I got was to this:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/pelso/regular/\r\n\r\nBut
  the R's aren't correct. Any ideas?"

    Light</a>.\r\n\r\nFor the headline (and the future):\r\nActually, anything but
    \u2018ID font\u2019 or similar is good. Try to find a descriptive title, so that
    we can discern the numerous threads. It could be \u2018tight light caps\u2019
    or \u2018thin geometric sans-serif\u2019 etc. Typing out the sample text (\u2018David
    Carradine\u2019) is another good option.\r\n\r\nFlorian"

  body: My guess is Futura Light. Especially if its from a movie that is maybe 30
    - 40 years old.

  body: "Thanks for a quick reply! Much appreciated. And thanks for clearing out the
    topic. It's duly noted.\r\n\r\nIt sure is Futura Light. But it looks even \"lighter\"
    in the image. Maybe they've done some editing on it, or perhaps there's an \"extra
    light\" version available out there?\r\n\r\nThanks again. :)"
