    font within a graphic? If you do, try to replace it with itself.\r\nOtherwise
    I usually place EPS files inside of inDesign and not AI.\r\nThe problem you are
    describing has never happened to me though."

    less headache-y way would be\r\n\r\nGo to the top drop-down menu and select 'object'
    then 'path' then 'outline stroke'. Once your text are properly outlined (and make
    sure color is in cmyk for print). Save the ai file into eps (uncheck embedded
    fonts).\r\n\r\nIf you insist on using ai, again you should outlining the text.
    \r\n\r\nIf you really insist on using ai and choose to not outline the text. Make
    sure you are login as the administrator of the computer. And perform all task
    as the admin. But note that once the indesign and the illustrator files leave
    your computer or different login. Fonts will be replaced again with the default
    serif/Sans-serif\r\n\r\n*please note that once you outlined the text, you can't
    go back and edit them as text. so you might want to save a copy of the master
    file"

  body: "Thanks johnnydib, and jwchen I was just on the verge of doing exactly that,
    but luckily I came across the solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solution\r\nOk so
    after hours of trying to figure out what was going on I came up with a solution
    that tells me nothing of what was going on but still solves the problem without
    being destructive to the font\r\n\r\nThe big answer is .....\r\n\r\nIndesign does
    not reconize the .ai file on the initial import so I had to right click the image
    -> Edit Original -> Change something within illustrator -> save the .ai file ->
    Problem solved within Indesign\r\n\r\nThe only problem after that is that I have
    a 104 page document and I will have to go through all 104 pages to fix the problem.
    \r\n\r\nwhich brings up a question \r\nIs there any way to make global changes
    in illustrator to multiple documents?\r\n\r\nbut on the bright side it did get
    fixed\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    far as PSDs go I don't think they make it safely to a printing press. Of course
    a PSD sits perfectly fine in InDesign saving it as a TIFF is just the last thing
    before print.\r\nHowever with digital printers anything goes of course."
