  it. But one thing irritates me: the weirdly spaced numerals.\r\n\r\nI mean the spacing
  isn't supposed to like this, is it?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alinea_5570.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
  comparison this is what the Monotype version of Alinea Sans looks like (which I
  didn't buy):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alinea_monotype_3664.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  idea how to fix the spacing? (I use LaTeX and typography is only a hobby of mine.)"

    second is called lining figures, which are an update on old-style figures, and
    are proportionally spaced."

  body: Yeah ok, I get that. But why are tabular figures the default in Alinea Sans?
    I've looked through the font with FontForge and there are no lining figures available.
    Why not? I can't imagine the primary purpose of Alinea Sans being accounting/spreadsheet.

  body: "@ Trevor: <em> \u2026 lining figures, which are an update on old-style figures,
    and are proportionally spaced. \u2026 </em>\r\n\r\nActually, lining figures may
    be have either proportional or tabular (monowidth) widths. So may oldstyle (lower
    case) figures.\r\n\r\nTabular figures have traditionally been the default figures,
    and many foundries still follow this practice. One reason is that many applications
    do not support OpenType figure alternates, in which case tabular figures have
    a lesser chance of \"failure\", as they will not fail quite so catastrophically
    in a situation where proportional figures would be better, as proportional figures
    will fail when tabular figures are called for.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the overall
    default situation is for OpenType fonts with multiple figure styles, but in my
    recent OpenType fonts I've made the default proportional, unless the figure style
    is particularly suited to being tabular (e.g. in the Modern Suite, a 19th century
    revival).\r\n\r\nI don't know LaTeX, but would imagine there is some clever way
    to solve your problem by custom kerning."

    font with proportional lining figures as default?
