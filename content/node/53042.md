  found to my typeface so far. There are a number of differences, and in the main
  they are down to me aiming for this to be a contemporary typeface, rather than a
  70s throw-back.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/london1970_5025.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
  is actually only the lower-case that are really similar, I aim for my upper-case
  set to be much more angular. USeful for reference though!"
