  the entire document?

  body: Hmm. Nevermind. I opened it up with Text Edit and could just copy and paste.

  body: That's the only way to do it, Tiff -- because it's generated, getting it out
    is a serious pain.

    hand is a dangerous tool in the author''s hand. '

  body: Nope, not the only way. In Word, you can convert the results of generated
    fields (e.g., page numbering, indexes, TOCs, TOFs, TOAs) to in-place plain text
    by putting the cursor in the field and then pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F9.

  body: Wow, that's a new one on me, and a welcome change at that.  What version/platform
    of Word, Gus?  (I'm thinking it's got to be pretty recent....)

  body: "Windows, at least as far back as Word 97. I don't have access to a Mac, so
    I don't know if it works in any Mac versions.\r\n\r\nBTW, I said \"plain text\"
    in the heat of the moment, but the converted text retains whatever paragraph or
    character style you had applied to the field. That means that you don't lose things
    like font size, tabs, bold, italic, small caps, etc."

  body: "Interesting -- I was working on Word 2000 (on a PC) maybe 18 months ago,
    and we couldn't get anything to work. Period.\r\n\r\nBut I'll file it away in
    case I ever get another gig (highly unlikely!) with that client....\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the tip!"
