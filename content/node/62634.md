body: I was curious what fonts would say 1990s (please no comic sans, grungy fonts,
  typewriter fonts or computerish/techy fonts). that were good then and still hold
  up today. Preferably from the first half of the 90s.

  body: "Beyond typefaces designed with specific trends in mind like you mentioned,
    I don't know that any specific font would really say 1990... You could just pick
    a great typeface that was designed in the 90s. Perhaps a Zuzana Licko or Jonathan
    Barnbrook typeface.\r\n\r\nI think the closest you're going to get is a typeface
    of the post modern movement or beginning of the digital era. It's hard to say
    since I don't know what the project is, but perhaps it'll be more about how you
    set the type than the actual typeface. If you want to pick an iconic 90s designer,
    it seemed like David Carson cared very little about typeface he was using and
    more about how it was arranged on a page.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read
