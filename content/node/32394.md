  body: "There was also a version made by NovelFonts, called 'Greenwood'. My notes
    have it as equivalent to 'Grecian Bold' in the Solotype Catalog. Therefore I'd
    guess the Solotype font Rob picked would be virtually the same, which is good
    to know, because the NovelFonts are not to be found any more. (Sold as the Expresiv
    Ornate Font collection in the mid-1990's.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    as we have identifiers from all over the globe, we provide 24 hour service, almost
    7 days a week. So you ask for a font ID anytime you want. Nifty, innit? ;^)"
