  body: In TrueType / OpenType TT fonts, you can use ANY em-square &#40;up to 16384&#41;.
    For example 200, 202, 500, 523, 998, 1000, 1024, 2000, 2048, 2049 etc. Pleae forget
    the neccesity of using an UPM that is a power of two!  <BR>If you use FontLab
    or TypeTool, just design your font as PostScript and generate it as TrueType.
    If you wish to fine-tune the screen appearance, you can refer to Leslie Cabarga&#39;s
    book &#34;Learn FontLab Fast&#34; &#40;<a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.logofontandlettering.com/</a> &#41; for tips on the
    process of converting PostScript fonts to TrueType fonts.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam

  body: Also true for PostScript Type 1 and PostScript flavored OpenType fonts, with
    the caveat that regardless of the em square, all coordinates used in the font
    must be no greater than &#43;- 4096 &#40;or is it 4095, given the use of zero
    as a coordinate? I forget&#41;. <BR> <BR>IIRC, earlier versions of FontLab had
    a problem generating T1/OT-CFF fonts with em squares other than 1000, but I believe
    that restriction has been lifted. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    &#34;does not work on Mac OS 8/9..&#34;? while  <BR>&#62; OpenType PS &#34;works
    on Windows, Linux,  <BR>&#62; Mac OS 8.6, 9. and OS X&#34;.  <BR> <BR>There are
    issues and problems with OT TT and with OT PS.  <BR> <BR>The downside of OT PS
    is that in Office 2000/XP for Windows and in any non-Adobe application running
    on Windows 95/98/ME, you will only get Western characters from OT PS fonts &#40;or
    the multilingual characters will be problematic to access&#41; while you will
    get multilingual/Unicode characters from OT TT fonts. Only Office 2003 and Windows
    2000/XP/2003 are free from the mentioned limitations of OT PS fonts.  <BR> <BR>The
    downside of OT TT is that it does not work on Mac OS 8.6 or 9, and that the outlines
    are not stored in PostScript curves which seems important to some designers.  <BR>
    <BR>Other advantages and disadvantages of the formats are listed in the book,
    most notably regarding hinting.  <BR> <BR>Re 2.:  <BR> <BR>Yes, principally OpenType
    PS/TT helps you solve the compatibility problem, and yet, it is extremely difficult
    to decide between the PS and the TT flavor because of problems mentioned above.  <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Unless you are planning to license your fonts to Microsoft, who still
    have this as a procurement requirement.

  body: 'Paul,  <BR> <BR>all fonts that Microsoft ships with Windows, Office etc.
    have one unified UPM size &#40;of 2048&#41;. For Microsoft, this surely simplifies
    quality assurance.  <BR> <BR>Microsoft explains that on their web page: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ProductionGuidelines.mspx"
    target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ProductionGuidelines.mspx</a>  <BR>
    <BR>Other vendors such as Apple or Linotype have been shipping TrueType / OpenType
    TT fonts with other UPM sizes for years. The value of 1000 is most common, especially
    if you ship PostScript and TrueType fonts from the same source. But Apple also
    shipped fonts with completely different UPM sizes, e.g. 400 for the Zapfino &#40;AAT&#41;
    font in Mac OS X 10.3.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam'

    using a power of two is no big deal &#40;unless it&#39;s for MS&#41;, I do suspect
    that there are a lot more &#34;quality&#34; fonts among that 26.83% than there
    are among the other. So it would be nice to have a filter on those stats - but
    how do you measure quality? Well, I don&#39;t think you can, numerically, but
    here&#39;s an idea: break down each of those percentages according to the level
    of hinting included. <BR> <BR>hhp'
