    It\u2019s certainly custom, presumably made by [[http://www.esmog.org/page_overview.php|Elektrosmog]]."

  body: "both links are correct. eleketrosmog may have designed the typeface - they
    certainly designed the catalogue -> work/edition patrick frey/ on their site.
    \r\nlineto is a foundry that releases typefaces made by the founders + friends
    of them, so elektrosmog (like norm and others swiss studios and designers) have
    released typefaces through lineto."

  body: "Mike, I\u2019m sorry, but lineto too isn\u2019t the best arranged site ever.
    However, if you need further proof that Elektrosmog actually do typefaces: Some
    of them have even been talked about here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/41355\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/17567\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/60713\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    if the riddle can\u2019t be solved, I might well ask the people at Patrick Frey
    themselves \u2013\_they sit just around the corner."

  body: "The name of the typfaces is Bradford. If you download the Patrick Frey pdf
    here www.swips.ch/downloads/Vorschauen/patrick_frey_09.pdf \r\nand open it in
    acrobat it tells you that the name of the fonts embedded. Also its nice if you
    want to get a closer look at the typeface.\r\n\r\nTo me it neither looks very
    alike Palantin or Galaxie Copernicus. But it feels a bit like dtl Fleischman,
    with its very smooth outlines (if you take a look at the vectors in the pdf you
    can see that most corners ar rounded) which gives the typfeace a nice soft texture.\r\nSince
    I haven't been able to find any information about it on the net, I also guess
    that its an unreleased typeface. I personaly doubt that it is designed by Elektrosmog,
    since it has a rather different look from the typefaces they usualy make.\r\nI
    think it looks more like a revival of a baroque typface which is based on prints,
    so the lettershapes are smoother and rounder. But thats just a guess.\r\n\r\nAnyway
    thanks for your help, as always typophile members have been very supporting"

    I can see all key letters to code it properly). Is Lineto the source for the font,
    even though it is not available for sale to the general public (yet)? Any idea
    about the year of design, or names of actual designer(s)? I tried Googling it
    and was not able to locate anything that mentions the font.\r\n\r\nThanks Beaclair
