body: "I'd like to use Hoefler Text for setting text but one annoying feature I can't
  turn off is the final form of some italic letters (n, m, t). I'm using a Mac and,
  no matter what I do, if the text is in italic and that letter is not followed by
  a word or a point, it turns out with the \"fancy\" final form, which can't be changed
  even using the typography options. Even if I de-select glyph variants, and chose
  the variant form I want, it is not changed in the text (see image).\r\nIs this a
  feature of the specific font, its version, or the OS?\r\n\r\nIn that case, should
  I just move on and use another font?"

    settings don\u2019t have an effect. \r\nAnd the Glyph Variants options works for
    the small caps version, the superscript and subscript version, but choosing the
    base glyph doesn't work. I guess this should be reported as a bug to Apple. "

  body: TextEdit, Pages, Keynote, and even LibreOffice have the same problem. But
    I've found that Word doesn't. Buggy font features in the one and only system font
    that offers those "advanced" features... I guess I'll just change the font, then.

  body: '"Overlapping characters" does nothing. There must be something automatic
    with Apple software -- if I put a dot after the character, it goes back to "normal".
    There is a trick I''ve found out that can result in the desired effect, though:
    if I press "tab" within italics, or if I place a character at the end of the text
    after a lot of tabs (no "enter", though), glyph variants don''t appear. I guess
    that can be done with headings, but with running, long text it''s too much work.'

  body: The Mountain Lion version of Hoefler Text somehow fixes the problem. Still
    wish there was a bold version instead of black shipped with the OS, though.
