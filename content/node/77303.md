body: I purchased this font back in 2002 and have since replaced my computer. Unfortunately,
  my computer crashed before I got rid of it so what mattered more was saving my documents
  versus my fonts. Anyhow, I need help identifying the font so I can rebuild my company
  logo. Thanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sector_5370.jpg]
