  browsed through thousands of logos. Maybe this isn't the way to go. Maybe everything
  that I need to communicate is bundled into the font itself. I was reading an article
  entitled \"Creating Beautiful Fonts,\" and it led me to the Typophile community.\r\n\r\nWhat's
  in a name? I have a decent enough domain name to work with, but I would love to
  find a unique font, that by itself, could be recognized. I'll give you a brief,
  and I'd love to hear your suggestions. All suggestions will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nBusiness

    customize, hopefully in a\r\ndirection that evokes your brand.\r\n\r\nIn your
    case I'm thinking you could take something\r\nlike FF Primary* and -very judiciously-
    make it much\r\nwider, since width conveys friendliness (\"every income\r\nlevel
    and every lifestyle\"). I'd also change the bottom of\r\nthe \"L\" to slant up
    like the bottom of the \"e\", and possibly\r\nslant the top & bottom of the \"o\"
    in the same way.\r\n\r\n* Especially the Round Bold cut:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-primary/round-bold/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    one nice bonus about Primary (although not the\r\nRound cuts) is that it comes
    in \"layers\" that you can\r\napply in different colors (hopefully just shades
    of one\r\nbase color :-) to \"build\" depth - sort of like furniture.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    feel? Is it standard to use all uppercase? What color or shade should i be thinking

    is a good place to start; but it's only one part (and it's also really more complex
    than just following one person's, or even a few people's suggestions). Then there's
    how to set the text in question. There's the whole world of color. The question
    of additional graphical elements. Customization of the lettershapes. No offense,
    but the nature of your questions makes me suspect that if you continue this way
    you're probably only going to tap into a tiny corner of the vast array of possibilities
    and variables that need to be carefully negotiated to result in a truly solid
    and successful solution \u2013 successful not just in terms of looking good, but
    in communicating what you need it to, and reinforcing your brand."

    like to have a good idea of what to ask for. Typography is definitely not my field.
    I'm an Electronics Engineer, so way out of my element here.\r\n\r\nToo bad there
    wasn't a typography equivalent of 99designs, where the client could pay a few
    hundred dollars to see multiple design examples. The paradox is knowing enough
    about what i should be asking for, before i ask for it. That's where I'm trying

    on the other hand is just an insult. Most of us here make a living designing stuff,

    \u2014 if not more. With your budget the hourly wage is nowhere near a decent

  body: "I just realized that I failed to answer some specific questions:\r\n\r\n>
    Does the slant on the L give it a lighter feel?\r\n\r\nMore than lightness, what
    slant would do (both in the \"L\"\r\nand the \"o\") is make the overall visual
    impression more\r\nconsistent, since the other four letters in the name all\r\nexhibit
    that idiosyncratic slant. The letterforms in a\r\nfont are designed to work well
    \"on average\" with all the\r\nother letterforms, and when you have a <em>specific</em>
    set of\r\nletterforms to work with (as with a typographic logo)\r\nthen the opportunity
    arises to tune the letterforms in\r\nways that amplify the setting at hand.\r\n\r\n>
    Is it standard to use all uppercase?\r\n\r\nThere is no standard, and in fact
    in this case\r\nusing all-caps would go against your identity.\r\n\r\n> What color
    or shade should i be thinking of?\r\n\r\nAny color as long as it's black. Kidding.
    That's just\r\nwhat a type designer likes to limit things to. If you\r\nwant to
    play it safe maybe furniture = brown? But of\r\ncourse it's not that simple, and
    I would defer to the\r\nprofessional graphic designers amongst us when it\r\ncomes
    to color.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Your company's visual identity is more than just a logo. It's also the design
    of your website, letterhead, business cards, business forms, advertising, signage,
    packaging, etc.  \r\n\r\nIf you want your company to look professional you should
    hire a professional graphic designer (or design firm). I'd suggest interviewing
    local designers so you can meet them face to face. Review their portfolios, ask
    them how they would approach the job, ask to see examples of similar jobs they've
    done for other clients, ask for a list of other companies they've done similar
    jobs for and call to ask how the jobs went, get a written estimate giving estimated
    fees, expenses and timelines for your projects."

    was golden and with rays = sun-like. Of course, it had to be golden. OR comes

    within its environment, a dozen designers would come up with at least two dozen
    concepts all of which work to some degree or another. You will need to see it
    in a web environment, on packaging, on delivery notes or invoices, maybe print
    advertising or another half dozen applications to appreciate its functionality.\r\n\r\nYou
