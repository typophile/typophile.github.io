    not sure what I find more objectionable about these fonts: the copying of other
    peoples' designs, or the bullsh\u0456t claims about the fonts' technical quality
    and craftsmanship."

  body: "Yes, tis one ugly font. I'm hoping someone can direct me to the original
    font that Roger scanned or perhaps suggest a very similar font. I want to purchase
    the rights to the outlines and do some tweaking of the font for a project.\r\n\r\nOldnick,
    the title was in my subject line, \"Keele decorated\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    very similar, but it has some of the same attitude.

  body: "I hunted through my books with bold scripts, Solotype Catalogs, and good
    old Script Guide, but didn't see a match for this 'beauty'. I actually think this
    may have been one of the few original fonts done by this vendor. You know, the
    kind of font that anyone can make if they draw within a template box? This is
    like other hand-drawn styles. \r\n\r\nStephen's suggestion of Geetype would be
    a major style upgrade from this one. Another suggestion for a roughly similar
    feel could be Bison, which used to be available from Berthold, but which I can
    no longer find anywhere.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    that I could just take the outlines by opening the font in Ilustrator - yikes!
    \r\n\r\nI also checked about 700 fonts at MyFonts. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah, yes, That font shows up in the Expresiv Font Brush Script collection
    sold by Tiger Direct in the mid-90's. I have notes that say this was based on
    a Photo-Lettering typeface called Pennington Popcorn. I have to say that that
    particular font collection was really inferior work, and not up to the standard
    of the other Expresiv collections done by 'World Art'. The letterforms were poorly
    shaped copies of the originals and were not kerned well. Letter sizes didn't even
    match properly.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
