body: "Greetings.\r\n\r\nThis is a font that flourished mostly around 1940, looking
  similar to contemporary Italian Art Deco poster lettering.\r\n\r\nI think I saw
  it elsewhere when I was a kid, but nowadays I can only find this particular one
  in the fa\xE7ade of two buildings designed by the Chilean architect Juan Mart\xEDnez
  Guti\xE9rrez.\r\n\r\nESCUELA DE DERECHO UNIVERSIDAD DE CHILE\r\n[[http://congresocivil.cl/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ejempo-940x340.jpg]]\r\n\r\nESCUELA
  MILITAR DEL GENERAL BERNARDO O'HIGGINS\r\n[[http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6426/2444/1600/Escuela_Militar.0.jpg]]\r\n\r\nCommon
  glyphs between both pictures: ACDEHILRSU.\r\nThe N letter has a different shape
  in each picture.\r\n\r\nAlso, the first one has V, while the second one has BGMOT.\r\n\r\nThe
  following is the awful result of me trying to reproduce the shapes of the letters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4465.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  shape of the letters E, G, M, R, S (and the N in the second picture) are the most
  distinctive traits of this font.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the G looks odd, like a C
  with a downwards spur, resembling a sickle.\r\n\r\nPlease help me find a similar
  font to this one. A hard task, since there are thousands of Art Deco-like geometric
  fonts."

  body: "You say that some letters differ between the buildings. Perhaps the architect
    did not use a single source for the lettering.\r\nVarious fonts have letters similar
    to your sample.\r\nFor example the S is close to the S in Aase, designed by A.
    Bihari for VGC in 1977.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AaseReg_5047.gif]\r\nImage
