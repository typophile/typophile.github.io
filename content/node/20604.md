  current versions of Poliphilus and Blado (Monotype) seem to preserve most of the
  charm of the originals - at least in comparison to the current wispy digitization
  of say, Bembo, unless we're talking about Bembo-Book or Aetna.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Poliphilus
  and Blado could be a little fatter here and there, but I do get the overall impression
  of inkspread-like thickness. I suppose they were fairly heavy to begin with, a characteristic
  which serves them well now. More than just a vestigal tail. \r\n\r\nMaybe I've been
  ogling Igino Marini's Fell Revivals more than I should: http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html.
  And they're free, too. "

    I assume it's a refernce to the actual football club, but I'm impressed nonetheless.
    \r\n\r\nYes, Poliphilus was copied from the actual face as it appeared on paper.
    Even the ink spread was reproduced, giving the font a rough and beautiful quality.
    An ambitious idea, to be sure, but it doesn't appeal to everyone. Still, I'd certainly
    choose Poliphilus over the weak and anemic Bembo, Perpetua, and Centaur we have
    in digital form today. Many of the classics reproduced in digital form today lack
    that meaty, dark quality that characterized printed matter of the past. Ink pressing
    into paper versus inkjets and laser. \r\n\r\nThere are, however, notable exceptions:
    Dante, Bulmer, Miller, Elzevir, Fleischmann, etc. DTL Elzevir and DTL Dorian are
    exceptionally well done. "

    yes. There are several reasons why modern classics look so even, perfect?, sharp
    and often thin compared to the old ones.\r\n\r\n1. time is todays cost factor
    one\r\n2. large pointsizes are easier to draw and often printed in specimens\r\n3.
    digitization is often a copy and paste or master and slave thing, the little differences
    will be equalised\r\n4. the ink spread, what make sharp metal contours look round,
    will not be calculated for the text design\r\n5. but sharp type look better on
    screen\r\n6. today we have an other taste in these things too\r\n\r\nIf you like
    a certain metal type design and you begin to collect printed material on it from
    different print sources, you will see very different gray scales and ink spread
    situations, depending on the ink, the press, the paper the craftmenship and of
    course, the freshness of the types. Sometimes even the very dark prints of the
    same type have its quality and taste. So, an historical, preserving digitization
    is not really posssible. You can try to come close but it will always be a new
    design. \r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\" target=\"_blank\">astype.de</a>--"

    agree, and I'm always looking for these kinds of typefaces. I've often used newspaper
    typefaces for book projects (the Linotype legibility series, Matthew Carter's
    Fenway). I've very happy that Monotype released Bembo Book now -- the old regular
    cut was always too light for me. I don't mind clean-polished outlines at all --
    on the contrary. When the curves are drawn right and have some beautiful inner
    tension (I was recently smashed away after I've taken a close look at Carter's
    Big Figgins Italic), I sometimes use enlarged excerpts of letterforms as graphic
    elements. I've only recently made the link in my mind between the overall quality
    of type that I like and certain specific features that influence it. I've known
    one such element for a long time now, and it was -- darkness. For my own personal
    taste, Monotype Plantin is just the precisely right degree of color on the page
    (when used in book sizes). I'm glad to see that some designers are now beginning
    to draw optical sizes again! \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
