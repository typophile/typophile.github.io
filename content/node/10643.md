  body: It feels really right for a software company &#40;the green is such a singular
    bit of individuality&#41; yet my eye can&#39;t find a stopping and starting point
    - I&#39;m drawn right to the middle. Does that make sense? <BR> <BR>

  body: The shapes are interesting, but I am more concerned that when the logo appears
    in small sizes, it becomes a lot less readable. The &#34;e&#34;s may fill in,
    the &#34;g&#34; shape becomes much less readable, the &#34;h&#34; almost disappears
    and the green dot in the &#34;i&#34; is almost lost as well.  <BR> <BR>What type
    of software do they produce?

  body: I like it. Can you post a small one? I think I have the same concerns as Jared.
    The h disappears and the g, for whatever reason, I&#39;m reading as a q. <BR>
    <BR>I think the problem with the h is that it is the only letter that morphs into
    the others. Perhaps just morphing all of the round letters as well, though that
    may put too much emphasis on the &#39;nix&#39;.

  body: 'TL : I get what you&#39;re saying, think it&#39;s the way the h rolled in
    to it&#39;s neighbors. Made some adjustments. <BR> <BR>JB &amp; D : I agree with
    what you&#39;re saying. Maybe thinning out the lines and darkening the grey a
    few shades would make it work. <BR>This project is being put on hold for a while,
    though. About the software : I&#39;m not at liberty to say. Seriously, they&#39;d
    be upset. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7216.gif"

  body: For the &#39;g&#39; try removing the dangling curve at the bottom  <BR>and
    flipping the shape horizontally. Than add the curve <BR>to the bottom of the new
    tail. You&#39;ll have a more <BR>conventional &#39;g&#39;, but no legibility issues.

  body: 'I think it looks slick, very modern. The thing is, I don&#39;t get how it
    relates to either &#34;ego&#34; or &#34;phoenix&#34; or the combination. That&#39;s
    not to say it doesn&#39;t -- I just don&#39;t see it. I think a logo should connect
    solidly to the company or individual it represents. <BR> <BR>Minor note: I agree
    with the comments about the <i>g</i>.'

  body: 'yea, the g still isn&#39;t a g. I&#39;m not sure how to read it.  <BR> <BR>If
    you take stephen&#39;s suggestion, perhaps extend the extenders of the h and p
    to match in length. <BR> <BR>Have you considered coloring the ego green as well?
    It may deliminate the two words a bit better. '
