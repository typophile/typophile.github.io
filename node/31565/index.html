Personnaly I would recommand netherland: gerrit rietveld academie or werkplaats typografie (that's a 2 years master). There are other schools but i'm not really aware of the quality of the education.

I can’t speak from recent experience but there are many colleges in the UK which might suit, some of which were recognised as being better for some areas than others (eg LCC (formerly LCP) was recognised for typography), maybe more recent students could advise. 
Most teach in English:)

		<div class="commentbody">Jon, I studied for two years in Germany. German higher education is a different sort of animal. While there are a few graduate programs that are offered in English, German languages is still more or less something that cannot be gotten around.

The entire time I was a student here, I kept hearing great things about Dutch schools, and many of my classmates were waiting for the first opportunity to run for the border. So there could be something to these recommendations.

Studying in the UK as an American is, at least in comparison with the rest of Europe, insanely expensive. Nevertheless, the total cost per year is still a little less than going to a private University in the US (even with the current Pound–Dollar rate), if that helps. And you can use the same sort of loans.</div>

That's interesting about the British schools in terms of comparing them to the US. That is something to keep in my mind. I wouldn't have thought that would be the case. In the end, it's going to cost a lot. It's possible I'm just more interested in being abroad for awhile, and if you're going to graduate school, I feel like you should be 100% motivated about the program you're attending. So perhaps it should be a search for a good program first, rather than place. Obviously it depends on your portfolio, but I wonder how much European schools value American designers? And I'm still curious about South American options... I could pick up the Spanish well. Anything in Spain, maybe?

This is certainly true. But it can be easy to motivate yourself for a place, too.

> Obviously it depends on your portfolio, but I wonder how much European schools value American designers?

I interviewed with several German schools, and all of the schools that answered my inquiries (half of the ones I contacted…) seemed very interested. There are not many Americans studying at German universities, at least when one compares Americans to many other national groups. The exotic factor helps the admissions process speed along, I think. This might not be as true in the UK, where Americans tend to flock (relatively), because of the language.

Swiss schools may be easier for Americans to get into than other for students from the EU. I think that Swiss schools have quotas for certain countries. Again, when you are applying from the US, you are competing against a smaller group that say, if you were applying from Germany or France, who are just across the border and share similar languages.

I've heard good and bad things about design schools in Spain and Argentina (but I could say the same about the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, etc.…). Maybe if you got a short list, you could visit a few first?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Encouraging... OK. Here's more. So how do folks feel about this. At the moment, my design fire is burning a bit low. When I was an undergrad, I was WAY INTO graphic design. Now, after being a designer for a while I'm only WAY INTO certain areas of graphic design. Typography and books being the heavy hitters. What I feel as though I'm in need of at the moment, as a designer, is some inspiration and motivation. The type of freedom one experienced as an undergrad perhaps. I felt like an art back then. I guess I'm looking for something to stoke the fire, in a way. Can graduate school be used for this purpose? Has anybody used graduate school for this purpose?

i havent really heard about this. at some universities with some degrees there are quotes for international students (HSG St.Gallen for example). i havent heard the same for art schools like the hgkZ. they take some international students every year, but so little that i cant think of a use for quotas there. a whole years' class in graphic design in zurich is max. 20 students. in the last years they've taken 15-18 with the initial process (most being swiss) and then exchange students to fill up to 20 if available.

anyway, you wouldnt come around learning german if you'd want to study in switzerland.</div>
