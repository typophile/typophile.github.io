  TV show Poirot:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agathachristie-poirot11_4573.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I have seen Plaza referenced in my previous searches, but it is definitely
    not the right font.

  body: I absolutely LOVE Poirot, although the graphics are butt ugly. Always thought
    of Mostra when I saw the intro, but that's a more recent revival of the style
    I think.

  body: It is a great show, n'est-ce pas?  Lots of great art deco and arts & crafts
    styling in the show...including this mystery font, whatever it is. I hope someone
    here can use their little grey cells to figure out what it is!
