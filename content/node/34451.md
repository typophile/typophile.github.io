  body: I think the &#8220;C2W&#8221; part is actually Times New Roman. As for the
    rest of it, it&#8217;s too small to tell, but it looks like something different.

    New Roman) seems obvious.\r\n(Why does religious stuff look so ugly so often?)"

  body: "'cuz it's from the 90's and they are low budget, hehe. I used times but had
    to manipulate it a bit. Will be good enough for my purposes. Thanks folks. I looked
    through all the fonts in my fontexplorer but didn't think of Times. Crap I neeeeed
    a holiday!\r\n"
