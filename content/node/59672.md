body: "Well, my account page says I've now been on Typophile for 4 years.\r\nWhere
  does the time go?\r\n\r\nOver this time I've asked a few questions, suggested an
  answer or two, and entered a few of the design challenges (sometimes aquitting myself
  quite reasonably, at other times making a bit of a tit of myself).\r\n\r\nIt might
  be worth explaining at this point, as George Formby once said, why I'm here and
  what my motives are.\r\n\r\nUnlike the more useful Typophiles, I'm not a professional
  typographer or type designer, nor even a graphic designer. I'm just one of the many
  interested amateurs. But I do like to \"have a go\". There are any number of creative
  endeavours \u2013 typography, cartooning, solving and compiling cryptic crosswords,
  Escher-style tessellations, hand bookbinding, ambigrams, \u2013 where I've seen
  and admired other people's work, and thought to myself, \"I wonder if I could do
  that?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the answer often turns out to be: A bit: Just well enough to
  impress friends and colleagues who can't do whatever-it-was at all, but not well
  enough to run with the folks who do it for a living. And that doesn't really matter
  much, so long as I enjoy myself when I have a go.\r\n\r\nMy actual background stems
  from several years checking and formatting corporate documentation, which is why
  many of my posts involve standing up for MS Word. Yes, there's a lot of typographic
  stuff that it can't do (or can't do very well), but there's also a hell of a lot
  of other clever stuff that it <em>can</em> do, which you only wish some of the DTP
  packages could do. And, it's a lot better than most users' experience of it would
  suggest: you just have to learn its idiosyncracies, which settings to switch off,
  which to switch on, and which toolbar buttons to avoid like a Mexican pig farmer
  with the sneezes.\r\n\r\nI now work in the production department of the academic
  journals division of an international publisher, which is nice because it's an environment
  in which the desire to fix other people's spelling mistakes is a trait that's welcome,
  rather than considered an irritant (as it may have been in some previous jobs...).
  This job involves liaising between authors, editors, typesetters and printers. Some
  authors can be a pain when they don't understand that if our typesetters have already
  had their paper for a fortnight, any necessary changes should <em>not</em> be supplied
  as a whole fresh version of the original manuscript Word file. Or when they don't
  understand that if a 72-dpi image found off the web isn't good enough resolution
  for print, just opening that image in Paint Shop Pro and resaving it at 300 dpi
  isn't going to suddenly fill it with detail. Some editors can be a pain when they've
  had the production schedule all year but still insist on submitting their editorials
  about a month after the stated deadline. Some typesetters can be a pain when they
  unaccountably set the \xA9 symbol in a different font from the surrounding text,
  or use the letters TM superscripted instead of the proper \u2122 character, or tighten
  the tracking to make a paragraph fit, but then forget to loosen it again after the
  author's marked up to delete several words. Our printers, touch wood, are all great
  and have so far never proven to be a pain. Hurrah!\r\n\r\nThere's not a huge amount
  of scope for typographic self-expression, but I can...\r\n(a) politely request that
  the typesetters do not hyphenate \"streetsweeper\" as \"streets-weeper\" or \"therapists\"
  as \"the-rapists\", \r\n(b) occasionally get the opportunity to set a call for papers
  (when there just isn't the time to get them to do it and go round the intercontinental
  revise-amend-revise cycle with them), or an advert (when a non-print-savvy client
  pays for a half-page ad but supplies a full letter page of double-spaced Verdana
  rather than a pre-typeset PDF like everybody else) myself,\r\n(c) suggest alternative
  approaches when a new journal's being launched and the designer hired to do the
  cover offers hideous ideas containing photos with a perspective effect applied for
  no readily apparent reason other than that he's found that with his new version
  of InDesign he <em>can</em>.\r\n\r\nMS Word anecdote as an aside: In our department,
  one colleague produced and printed out a little insert to fit in a tray, with all
  our names in Times full caps and the numbers of the drinks we prefer from the drinks
  machine (so that anyone doing a drinks run would be able to remember who has what).
  Everyone else's names happen to contain letters that fit reasonably. Remember that
  Word has kerning switched off by default. The yawning gap between the A and V in
  DAVID on this insert gnawed at me for days. Eventually some drinks were spilled
  on the tray and my colleague opened the file to reprint it. I leapt in: \"Select
  all... now, go to format > font > character spacing ... and switch on that kerning
  tickbox. Now watch my name when you hit OK.\" Thankfully she appreciated this new
  bit of type awareness and didn't simply brain me with the tray..."

    and not getting better either, but I'm still enjoying every thread. I dont know
    why, I just never get bored with typography. The only reason I'm being passive
    in this forum is because my English is bed. See? :D"
