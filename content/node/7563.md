body: 'So, there&#39;s a videogame called <a href="http://half-life2.com">Half-Life
  2</a>. Its interface uses what appears to be <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=FF.9467.11.1">FF
  DIN Light</a>. I&#39;m a huge fan of both. <BR> <BR>Well, as most fans of a game
  or movie are inclined to do, they want to get their hands on the font. Being the
  foolish typophile that I am, I chastised the people running the site for allowing
  font piracy on their site, while they berate game piracy. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a
  response I got from a fan on the site: <BR> <BR>&#34;<i>as for &#34;the amount of
  effort it takes to make a font&#34; please.. dont make me laugh. Making a font is
  EASY. There are fonts out there that cost thousands of dollars, just so you have
  the right to use it publicly, its a joke. <BR> <BR>Fonts are not hard to make, stop
  kidding yourself. and FF DIN is a very basic looking font, clean lines, nothing
  fancy. I bet it didnt take long to make at all. It would be like me making signatures
  for people and charging them $1500 a go.</i>&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve already blasted
  him for his ignorance and explained &#40;briefly&#41; that he&#39;s wrong, but what
  I&#39;d like to know is if anyone here knows how long <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fonts&amp;searchID=692&amp;searchby=designer">Albert
  Jan-Pool</a>&#39;s FF DIN <i>actually</i> took to make? <BR> <BR>This is why people
  pirate fonts. Why non-designers do. I&#39;m just throwing fists against the castle
  walls in an attempt to change maybe one of their minds.'

    works for them for each head you convince. But I&#39;ll point Albert here and
    see if he thinks it&#39;s worth a bother. <BR> <BR>BTW, Linotype Maral took about
    800 hours for the Regular and Bold &#40;no italics&#41;. But it was my second
    outline font - I can do it a bit faster now. But not in an hour, like those guys
    probably think. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'I&#39;ve never made a font, and I&#39;ve only made small promotional games,
    but I&#39;m guessing that a game like half-life 2 would have taken many many times
    more hours than FF Din. I haven&#39;t checked the prices of either, but I would
    guess that FF Din costs more than a copy of half-life 2. <BR> <BR>But its not
    really about the hours, is it? <BR>You would assume that game designers feel that
    their role is a creative one, and probably the programmers do too. Designing and
    creating a typeface is also a creative role. The cost of both products includes
    a premium for the creativity of their designers. The size of the potential market
    is also a factor, as well as the composition of that market in terms of individuals
    or businesses. <BR>There are so many other factors that determine the price of
    a product that to reduce it to how many hours it took to create is irrelevant.
    <BR> <BR>Now Mr. &#39;FF DIN is a very basic looking font&#39; has to answer the
    question: <BR>If it didn&#39;t take very long, and its easy, why did he want to
    steal someone else&#39;s work instead of just knocking up a clean, basic font
    himself?'

  body: A friend and designer I know explained why he charges so much for a logo.
    &#34;It took me 20yrs of experience to get to the point where I can design something
    in a short period of time.&#34; Point being hours on a project are a relatively
    poor way of measuring quality.

  body: Even if FF Din, the complete family with alternates and all, only cost the
    same as a copy of Half-Life 2, or even just $20, people &#40;especially people
    like our friend here&#41; would still rip it off.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s classic rights
    management and licencing. Let the RIAA handle him. <BR> <BR>Aaron

    fonts owner to send a polite email to the sites owner asking for the font to be
    taken off the site. I

  body: Well, it looks like they&#39;re only posting the font resource that comes
    with the game files anyway, which I believe doesn&#39;t have a complete character
    set. So, while that&#39;s not great, it&#39;s not terrible. <BR> <BR>My little
    tirade on the site was meant to be an indirect heads-up to the site moderators
    to cover their asses and quash any piracy, but we&#39;ll see. <BR> <BR>Ironically,
    Half-Life 2 can cost from <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/235059.asp">$55</a>
    up to <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/243836.asp">$80</a> depending
    on which version you get via retail outlets &#40;the collector&#39;s version has
    all sorts of goodies&#41;. <BR> <BR>Another interesting note, Valve, the developer,
    is spearheading a new online content distribution method called <a href="http://www.steampowered.com">Steam</a>.
    On this platform, there&#39;s a $90 version. The interesting part is that it&#39;s
    an actual application that runs on your machine. You actually have to have a web
    connection to activate their products which is done via an application on your
    PC. A bit of remote DRM on their part. Considering how open these gamers are to
    letting Valve crawl onto their PCs and control their software, and the amount
    of $$$ it takes to get a PC to even play the game decently, I&#39;m surprised
    they&#39;re so defensive about $40.
