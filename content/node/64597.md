  pairs for greek?\r\n\r\nI'm using Leslie Cabarga's Kern King (http://www.logofontandlettering.com/kernking.html)
  for latin, and I'm wondering if there is some similar thing for Greek.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance, cheers!"

  body: "http://www.tiro.com/John/GreekNTKerning.zip\r\n\r\nThis is a list of Greek
    words (minus breathing and accent marks) from the Greek New Testament. The .txt
    files use production glyph naming for use in FontLab metrics window. The .doc
    files contain the words Unicode-encoded.\r\n\r\nThese files are good for kerning
    letter-to-letter. Combinations of letters plus marks also need to be kerned, particularly
    when adjacent to some caps and ascending letters."

  body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI am about to add punctuation and quotations to John's
    list.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know what is the greek quotations usage?\r\n\r\nI don't
    think that doing all the possibilities in the current string make sense:\r\n\r\n\u201C/alpha
    \u201D \u2018/alpha \u2019 '/alpha ' \"/alpha \" \u201E/alpha \u201D \u201A/alpha
    \u2019 \u201E/alpha \u201C \u201A/alpha \u2018 \u203A/alpha \u2039 \u2039/alpha
    \u203A \xAB/alpha \xBB \u2019/alpha\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    )\r\nthat in greek it is used \xAB/alpha \xBB (primary) \u201C/alpha \u201D (secondary).
    No indication for the third level. Any clue?\r\nAnd what about the apostrophes?\r\n"
