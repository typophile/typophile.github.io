body: Would anyone know of a good website that shows examples of complementary colours?
  I know there are books available on the subject but was thinking there may be a
  website dedicated to it. I was just thinking how great it would be to have a pdf
  with examples.

    or Art Director&#39;s toolkit. '

  body: Unless you&#39;re doing only web design, I would strongly advise you against
    looking at color examples on screen.  <BR> <BR>As Albers insisted, &#34;color
    is the most relative medium&#34;. And when you&#39;re talking about web, make
    that times three. It varies way too much from monitor to monitor to be reliable
    enough. If you have a chance, do some paper stuff or look at exapmles on paper
    if possible. <BR> <BR>There might be some decent texts though in those lists.

- body: Pantone publishes some books that show cmyk colors next to pantone colors,
    and you can use them to convert from cmyk to pantone. Pantone colors really are
    better than CMYK of course, but some people don&#39;t trust the books completely,
    since it IS published by Pantone. &#40;They want their colors to look better,
    and the cmyk mixes are usually duller than what is possible.&#41; But the book&#39;s
    usually a good place to start, and then you can tweak the percentages. Or, they
    have books that show cmyk mixes in two, three, and four color combos, in something
    like 5% increments, and then match it up to a color swatch as best you can, and
    then still tweak the cmyk mix by test printing. <BR>Or, ask your printer. They
    sometimes have their own mixes, and they know what works best with their printers,
    etc. <BR> <BR>
