  a font with the general weight and structure of Clarendon Bold or ITC Bookman Bold,
  but with a much fresher, more contemporary feel. \r\n\r\nRealize that's fairly subjective
  and apologize in advance for the ambiguity and lack of proper terminology.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\njarrod\r\n"

    It comes in normal, semibold, bold and even black, each with accompanying italics.\r\nThe
    proper term would be a [[slab serif]] or Egyptienne."

  body: "Why not go in a slightly different direction if you want contemporary? <a
    href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fedra_serif_a_bold/\">Fedra bold</a> by Typotheque
    is about as contemporary as you can get.\r\n\r\nI'm just not sure that slabs based
    on the Clarendon model feel particularly contemporary, though that would also
    depend on the usage.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you want to get crazy with a slab, try
    Storm's <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/typefaces-199-farao-black\">Farao</a>."

    on using the font? Application?\r\n\r\nI have recently used the lovely Belizio-Bold
    set in all CAPS for a T-shirt design and was very happy with the results.\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "hey all,\r\n\r\nFlorian, thanks for the proper terms.\r\n\r\nScott, I think
    it's just a matter of semantics - I think you got the idea regardless with the
    suggestion of Fedra.\r\n\r\nI like Caecilia as well - wish it went all the way
    to 95.\r\n\r\nIf going in the general direction of or vicinity of Fedra and Caecilia
    gives anyone other ideas, I'd like to hear those too.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\njarrod\r\n"
