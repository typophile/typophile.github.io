body: "I just noticed a peculiarity on the fonts.com site (Monotype) that could end
  up making you pay more than you need to for a font. The site figures out what country
  you're in and displays the prices in the appropriate currency. But currencies fluctuate
  relative to each other, and this pricing apparently isn't live.\r\n\r\nFor example,
  I'm in Canada, and a font was displaying $43 CAD. Switching the display to U.S.
  currency, I found the price is $35 USD. But the two currencies are about equal now.
  It should be about $35 CAD as well.\r\n\r\nBottom line: check the exchange rates
  and compare with other currencies. You might save money buying in something other
  than your home currency. Not a problem paying by credit card: the credit card company
  will convert it to your own currency on your bill.\r\n\r\nI've emailed Monotype
  about this; will post their response when I receive it."

    purchase. I usually get charged $5.00 for shopping at Linotype. \r\n\r\n:-) Mikey"

    the cost? I suspect that they bill in USD and this might just be something set
    up before GWB decided to spend the US down to our level. If they bill in USD,
    then you will get the actual rate, (less the credit card conversion gouge charged
    by your particular card)."

  body: "Gary, I've seen it in publishing with Can and US prices. When US was 5.99
    CAN was 8.99\r\nFor March of 2008, one publisher dropped the CAN price and it
    will be 5.99 for both\r\nbut in April of 2008 it becomes 5.99 in US and 6.99 in
    CAN \r\n\r\nI don't know why - and I don't know how they predict the future of
    currency - I just typeset it!"

  body: "I had a reply from Monotype about the currency matter, and they're looking
    into it.\r\n\r\nDon--I didn't go far enough through the checkout to see if they
    actually billed everything in USD, as I wasn't purchasing the font. I should have
    experimented with that. Still, if they're going to have prices visible in different
    currencies for the convenience of customers, they should be reasonably close to
    reality.\r\n\r\nJackie--I do book work too, and it has been a real hassle up here
    in Canada with the exchange rate changing so much in the last few months. I don't
    print a price on books in cases where I have the say--the stores can put their
    own sticker on. "
