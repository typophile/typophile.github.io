    always vectorise manually. It&#39;s also a great excuse for drinking buckets of

    used it, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still included in 10 or CS.

    I have to completly disagree. How could you say this? It does not have a 10th
    of the functionality that streamline has. NOT that I am any great streamline supporter./
    I think it is time for an updated app. <BR> <BR>To address the &#34;do it by eye&#34;
    theory. This doesnt always work. Not that &#34;everything cant been done by eye&#34;,
    but there are many things, and circumstances where a vectoriation app is a must.
    ESPECIALLY if you have ever spent time in a &#34;sign shop&#34; type atmosphere.
    It is a tool worth its weight in gold. <BR> <BR>I would be interested in hearing
    of another tool, better than streamline. This could really improve our workflow.

    don&#39;t consider Flash an extra step just because it&#39;s origianlly made for
    webdesign, it has some good editing qualities if you combine it with illustrator,
    you don&#39;t have to go through all the &#39;minus front&#39; stuff, for once.
    Just click and erase.

    does somewhat of an Offset Path to the negative yeilding as you can see negative
    corners . . . <BR> <BR>I simply use the Pathfinder tools to merge the shape and
    delete the little overshoot triangle thingys. <BR> <BR>Also, FYI, I use Streamline
    4.0 on a Classic Mac to convert any glyph drawings I want to maintain a &#39;bumpy&#39;
    or organic look with and I&#39;ve always been happy with the results. <BR> <BR>Anything
    from a handpainted script to a wacky display face is all drawn with orthoganinal
    nodes in Illustrator . . . <BR> <BR>I do highly suggest the shape you&#39;ve posted
    be drawn from scratch in Illustrator, it&#39;s mostly straight lines and shouldn&#39;t
    take but a minute. <BR> <BR>Good Luck, <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Illustrator&#39;s autotrace function isn&#39;t really useful for accurately
    tracing stuff, but it gets cool-looking results. Not useful, but interesting,
    especially when they&#39;re outlines with no fill. <BR> <BR>As far as vectorizing
    images &#40;besides fonts&#41;, I start with Photoshop. Go to Filter &#62; Artistic
    &#62; Cutout, make the image as detailed as you want it, then select certain areas
    &#40;usually I select similarly colored areas together&#41;, and run them through
    Streamline. If you do this for each set of shapes, you can put them together in
    Illustrator. I can never get Streamline to make things as detailed as I want them,
    so I use this method, which is actually quicker than it sounds. I probably just
    don&#39;t know how to use Streamline correctly. Laugh if you must.

    make the images as cutouts. <BR> <BR>Just select what you want to be made into
    paths and then do a convert selection to path.  Then either C&amp;P into illy
    or save as EPS.

    my question&#40;s&#41;...   <BR> <BR>1.&#41; What&#39;s the best method for hand-tracing?  To
    be honest, I&#39;ve been drafting glyphs on paper by hand, scanning them into
    CorelDraw, and then manually tracing them.  It&#39;s kind of clunky but it works.  This
    doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not looking for a better method.  Would a digitization
    pad and stylus work best, with Illustrator perhaps?   <BR> <BR>2.&#41; I don&#39;t
    like autotracing.  Does ScanFont allow manual traces?  &#40;I&#39;ve never really
    looked into it.&#41;  I&#39;ve heard it has a &#34;very precise&#34; autotrace
    function &#40;and I guess I could always eliminate the points I don&#39;t like
    when transferred into FontLab&#41;.  Anybody have fantastic results with ScanFont&#39;s
    autotrace?

    the issue for the free software too--but it&#39;s a UK publication and &#34;difficult
    to obtain at this time,&#34; according to my local bookseller.
