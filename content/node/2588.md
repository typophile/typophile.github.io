  body: This is pretty. Should the d &amp; b have similar thinning to that in the
    a? And I wonder if the k would be a little more curvy with similar fixing?

  body: Very cheerful and nifty. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to see that upward slant in
    the middle of the k. <BR> <BR>Maybe you should be concerned about the letterspacing
    difference between the forms with &#34;tails&#34; and the ones without. To make
    the spacing consistent, you would have to overlap to make them actually connect
    like a script, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s your intention.

  body: 'Nice. <BR>Some comments: <BR>The descender &#40;&#39;p&#39;&#41; seems too
    long. <BR>&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39; and &#39;r&#39; look too wide
    &#40;probably because they <BR>have the same width of &#39;b&#39;, &#39;d&#39;,
    etc&#41;. Make them narrower. <BR>Also, I don&#39;t think &#39;a&#39; should have
    that kind of tail.'

  body: Maybe try giving the &#34;b&#34; and &#34;d&#34; the same slope and raise
    as the &#34;a&#34;, &#34;c&#34; and &#34;e&#34;. The &#34;h&#34; looks like it
    could also use this treatment. the name of the font looks fantastic in the font
    I must say. <BR> <BR>I noticed that the &#34;h&#34; is not listed in your character
    set display. Have you completed all LC? Any ideas on what your UC is going to
    look like?
