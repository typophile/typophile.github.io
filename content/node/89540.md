  Illustrator and imported it into Fontlab.\r\n\r\nI knew that my monoline type was
  probably a bit on the light side but thought I would be able to embolden and generate
  a couple of weights from this base artwork without re-drawing.\r\n\r\nI am finding
  the multiple master stuff really confusing from the manual and can't seem to get
  anything to happen.\r\n\r\nAs said basically I just want to give what is essentially
  a hairline typeface a bit more weight.\r\n\r\ncould anyone advise on the best way
  to do this?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMatt"

    effect that does that, but it's gonna be far from good. You will have to draw
    after that, correct it.\r\n\r\nFor MultipleMaster to work, you need 2 weights
    with similar outlines in terms of amounts of points and starting points.\r\n\r\nBut
    if it's from an illustrator moonoline, the easiest is to make it bolder in illustrator,
    then reimport it in fontlab.\r\nAfter that you could try to mix both weights in
    a Multiplemaster to interpolate or extrapolate it.\r\n\r\n"

    python macro: Lock left edges \u2014 move right edges. I guess you can figure
    out the vertical bit yourself. The upside of this method is that you <em>take</em>
    as much white as you <em>add</em> black."
