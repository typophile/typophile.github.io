  building above is the headquarters of China Central Television. I think that it
  is easily one of the most aesthetically horrific structures I have ever seen. Yes
  it's a tribute to modern technology and how far we have developed, but that's it.
  I think it this building is an eyesore on the horizon of Beijing, much like the
  Lloyd building is an eyesore to London (having seen that first hand, it really does
  look like a cigar that has its end chopped off and was stuck into the ground.) \r\n\r\nWhen
  you compare this architecture with the classic work of Wright, Le Corbusier, Mies
  van der Rohe, Oscar Niemeyer, Alvar Alto, Antonio Gaudi (I could go on and on) this
  building is a great reminder of the fact that just because you can do something,
  doesn't mean you should. My grandfather was a wonderful architect in Moscow, and
  growing up with him I would go through his books of late 19th and 20th century architecture.
  If he would see this building, he would be horrified. I am not an architecture expert,
  but knowing a bit about the era that preceded modern day architecture, I can say
  it's not a testament nor a credit to modern day architecture.\r\n\r\nAnyone else
  agree/disagree?"

    and it\u2019s oddity than I do for its architectural design. But, that\u2019s

    But the meandering lines of the grid also suggests nature or natural elements.
    Those same lines however strong they really may be, suggest weakness and the protruding
    top on an uneven grid makes the stomach feel as queasy as looking up at Pisa's
    leaning tower. It definitely provokes thought and is not something to overlook.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as representing China, I can't say since my opinion is solely based on other
    people's experiences or lack thereof in the country.\r\n\r\nAs far as representing
    the direction of architecture as a whole, I would have to guess that was probably
    not the goal of the project. Although it might in so far as architecture today
    seems to be more focused on meeting the needs of it's specific client, upsetting
    traditional hierarchy of work environments, and letting computational algorithms
    drive design, especially in it's facade or \"skin\". \r\n\r\n[one example http://www.morphosis.net/

    they all seem to be from the same angle.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't like it, I think
    one must remember that one building does not a direction make. I think it's important
    for all kind of designers to explore \"design space\", and even if not every experiment
    is a success, we learn something from it. We make progress and establish direction
    from an aggregation of previous designs, and in every generation, there have to
    be some things that turn out to be bad ideas and some that remain good in retrospect."

    from any era. People hated the Eiffel tower, the St. Louis Arch, etc. I'm sure
    there was a group of Romans arguing about the Acropolis when it was being built.\r\n\r\nIconic
    architecture is just as much art as it is design and art, at times, is meant to
    cause a reaction more than anything. You spoke of FLW and his Guggenheim was hated
    by many folks at the time as well."

    was being built. But when the Athenians were busy building the Acropolis in Athens,
    the Romans only had control of their still rather small city on their seven hills
    (and maybe just a tad of the area surrounding it). They were hundreds of years
    away from conquering Greece. ;-)"

    in regurgitating what has been done for the last 30,40, or 50 years.  Corbu, Eames,

  body: "It is a wonky salute to Stonehenge.\r\n\r\nIt's new. It's innovative. It's
    not just another glass-box office tower, but a glass-box office tower that has
    broken out of it's rectangular mould - and into a more oddly shaped one. The building
    is not all that attractive and appears to be about style for the sake of style.
    Different to be different... Not much different from the empty visual calories
    of a new Easter bonnet -- Except an advantage enjoyed by viewers of Easter bonnets
    is that no matter how lovely or gaudy it is, you only have to look at it for a
    day or two. In this way, I think Koolhaas' CCTV Headquarters is the opposite of
    good design. Particularly for a prominent public building. All images I've seen
    of it are from the same angle showing the hole in the middle, where essentially,
    it looks like an angular donut. Rotate it from 45 to 90 degrees to the right and,
    if the renderings are drawn correctly and the photos don't lie, it's a slightly
    off balance letter 'z'. \r\n\r\nThere is something very unsatisfactory about that,
    similar to what you'd feel looking at half a bridge that ends abruptly part way
    across a river. Nice as a sculptural statement, perhaps but only if there is something
    that explains or resolves the implied instability. It poses a visual question
    about balance and purpose that goes unanswered. \r\n\r\nAre the exterior walls
    not vertical simply because, given enough steel, some good engineering and buy-in
    from the client, you can build walls at any angle you like? I don't think that's
    a good enough reason to impose such a large and improbable looking building on
    the people of Beijing. Will they find themselves thinking back with affection
    on the monotonous and shabby concrete architecture and shapeless olive-drab hats
    of the Cultural Revolution as they look up uneasily at the over-hanging upper
    floors?\r\n\r\nIn other words, I think it is pretentiously foppish.\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "I am a huge fan of contemporary architecture. I agree with others that you
    either like it or you don't. I think sometimes new things and ideas make people
    uncomfortable. I personally love the new CCTV building and find it fascinating,
    I would love to see it in person. It looks like it belongs in China, where else
    would a building like this fit in. Ever looked at photos of Shanghai, it is practically
    Blade Runner's LA. I also do love the work of Zaha Hadid, Santiago Calatrava,
    and Norman Foster who all push the boundries of both architecture and engineering
    in similar ways. I do think they do it better, but that is definitely up for debate.
    \r\n\r\nOn another note I think there may be some confusion on the \"cigar in
    the ground\" building. I agree with Tim, and have a feeling that Fant\xF4mas is
    speaking about 30 St Mary Axe, The Swiss Re building, in London sometimes referred
    to as 'the Gherkin' by Sir Norman Foster and not the Lloyd building. the Gherkin
    does have some resemblance to a cigar, but I wont go there. I know there was a
    lot of arguing and discussion especially amongst Londoners when it first went
    up and some people still hate it, many have learned to love and accept it though.
    I think it is an amazing iconic building that brings an even more modern feel
    to the London skyline that is so interesting, and I think the building itself
    is gorgeous. I think architecture is hard because you want the field to grow and
    develop, but because it isn't on paper or canvas and we live in it, it can be
    hard to watch as things change in your surroundings without your control. You
    can choose to no longer read a magazine because you hate the redesign, but you
    cant really get away from, maybe the Gherkin that was just built outside your
    window. However, if you do not allow progression and change where will the field
    go? We may as well all be living in FLW Prairie style homes, and I am sure that
    would make some of you very happy, but not all of us. \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gherkin\r\n"
