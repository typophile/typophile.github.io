  body: If you really do intend for this to be used on contemporary labels, you need
    to make the G look more like a G. Right now, I see B (e.g., Bothric). I think
    if you leave the upper part open, it will work better.

    this is because they are in use on the text) C, V, W, and S seem to be overweighted.\r\n\"m\"
    is to small when it is by a \"n\". It also needs a little more weight.\r\nHope
