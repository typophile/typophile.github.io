body: "Found a few faces I quite liked in an old sample book and fancied bringing
  a couple into the digital age.  had a look around but couldn't find digital versions
  of any, but wanted a few more eyes to check them over and ensure I don't duplicate
  work...\r\n\r\nFaces are here: http://www.stone-soup.co.uk/uploads/fonts1.jpg\r\n\r\nObviously
  Hidalgo is very much a Clarendon style slab, but there's a couple of differences
  (notably the 2 and 7 which I've failed to put on the sample), and Crusader seems
  to mostly be Swash/decorative caps -- I'm mostly interested in Philite, as I've
  fallen in love with it and want to get stuck in.\r\n\r\nAnyone spot any that I shouldn't
  bother with?"
