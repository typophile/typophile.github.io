  body: "Hi Mitch. Forgive my cattiness, but that's like saying, \"I need a toolset,
    but I can't find one anywhere that doesn't cost $40. Can anyone help with this?\"\r\n\r\nSome
    fonts cost money, and it's usually $25-50 per font. That said, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/compacta_sh_black_ot/\">Compacta
    Black</a> might suit your needs. It's $26."
