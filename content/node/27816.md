  suggestion ( the full attibution of the suggestion : Matthew Carter ) I visted Copps
  Hill Cemetary after Typecon was over & took photos of the grave stones. Some of
  the letterforms are pretty keen. Interesting Ligatures. Tasty Numbers. Edward Gorey
  style skulls. Some Chris Lozos style letterforms too - Chris: care to comment? And
  even 'copperplate style' making it onto stone. The link above will take you to the
  Flickr Set. I have not added these images to the Typecon Flickr Stream."

  body: Eben, those are great. My family and I were there on Monday before TypeCon
    started. We missed the train to Concord and had some time to kill and walked up
    there. It turned out to be one of our favorite spots in Boston. I love how it's
    way up on top of a hill. Did you notice the "narrowest house in Boston" across
    the street?

    A picture to proove it too. How cool.\r\n\r\nI went in the morning on a sunny
    day so I was either shooting into deep shadow or attemping to not create one -
    mostly shadow because the graves point north by enlarge. I recommend that a person
    go in the afternoon & on a cloudy day ideally speaking. Shooting in RAW format
    helped save these shots.\r\n\r\nAfter I took them I was ravenous and so I went
    to eat oysters."

  body: "Some of the letterform features are a result of the medium: slate, which
    is very brittle. But apparently it's also very weather-resistant and that's what
    makes New England headstones so special: they last for ages - so the letterforms
    are very old (in the case of Copps as old as the 17th century I think). So the
    disjoin in the bowl of many of the \"g\"s and that one-sided \"f\" are probably
    done to combat the brittleness. I also remember seeing a wonderful \"B\" with
    it's middle join not reaching the stem.\r\n\r\nBTW, that last \"i\" is funny:
    it looks like the guy put a\r\nplacement mark for the tittle, but never actually
    made it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "> do the graves really point north? \r\n\r\nThey did seem to point north
    more ofthen than not. Lots of graves were opposite so they pointed south. There
    were fairly few east or west pointing ones. Pointing/facing north might make sense
    because it would reduce the number of freeze/thaw cycles the carving would be
    subjected to. Or there could have been another reason - like a desire to point
    towards water maybe. Mostly I metioned it by way of advice for future photographers
    because they might want sideways light - or more somewhat more diffuse light to
    help capture more detail. Hrant is right that a really cloudy day might give you
    dull looking images. Of course a light diffuser might help..."

    English started off by importing their type from Holland, and were too cheap/lazy
    to add proper sorts for the thorn. By the time Caslon started making type from
    scratch it was too late. And I think they initially used a vertically flipped
    \"y\", before no longer even bothering with that extra effort.\r\n\r\nThis is
    quite a prominent case of technology affecting script. If they had been as concerned
    with their culture as they were with the fast buck, the English script would probably
    still enjoy the richness and elegance of the thorn (and eth).\r\n\r\nHere's a
