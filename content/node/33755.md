body: "As if I don\u2019t have enough to think about with my senior year of design
  school coming on, my SO and I are considering moving to the Bay Area after I graduate.
  Seeing as how the design environment on the West Coast is rather different from
  the starched-and-stuffy East Coast, I\u2019m starting to inform myself on what it
  takes to work out there.\r\n\r\nHow hard is it to find a steady job in San Francisco
  or Palo Alto? Should I consider lining up an internship to cover me right after
  graduation and look for a full-time job after I arrive? What are starting salaries
  out there like-AIGA/Aquent list the median for entry-level as $40,000, but with
  only 13 respondents I don\u2019t really trust that number. Is it easier to get hired
  there as an entry-level designer or with a few year\u2019s of experience? I know
  that I won\u2019t have a hard time finding some kind of job in Washington, so if
  the job market out west sucks I can always wait a few years.\r\n\r\nAnd how is the
  Bay area in terms of post-graduate design education? I\u2019ll probably want to
  start on an MFA in design in a few years, is the Bay area a good place for that?
  Also, am I correct in believing that there are good type design classes out there?
  I would like to start doing more type design (I just started my first font) and
  I would like to learn from others without moving to the UK. "
