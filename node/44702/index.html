<p>Been away a while. I have the hardest time designing for myself. Does anyone else have that problem? I&rsquo;ll like it, for like 2 seconds, and it&rsquo;s gone. The creative juices flow when I&rsquo;m working on project for other people, just not myself, to show my work (ie a portfolio site showcasing my work).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My design is much better when I work for—and with—others. That’s something that’s always hurt me in school; I probably should not have enrolled at a fine art school where so much revolves around individual “genius” and the students have little interest in working together. It doesn’t help that I have little interest in editorial matters or self expression; if I wanted to collect piles of text and image to arrange I’d be in journalism, if I wanted my feelings on a canvas I’d paint. I’m looking forward to getting back into a studio where I can brainstorm with people who aren’t convinced that their minds are the fount from which will spring human reality.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, I have no trouble doing type or lettering for myself. I can sit around drawing letters all day and not even notice the time slipping by, and I have plenty of ideas to keep me busy when I’m job hunting in the next few months.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This topic has been on my mind a lot lately. I&rsquo;ve been trying to come up with a new identity for my company for the last two or three months now. I&rsquo;ll get a new logo I like, design business cards, website, etc., and then a week later I&rsquo;m not happy with it. I think I&rsquo;ve probably come up with 3 or 4 new looks for myself, but nothing sticks. I&rsquo;m working on a new one now and I think I&rsquo;m just going to draw the line here and go ahead with it. It sure is frustrating though&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Firstly, excuse for my poor English but here is what I have to say.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy to analyze and give solutions for someone else&rsquo;s project than ones' own to design. Usually you are your own worst critic or client. When a client may reject your idea or have a different point of view, you usually can back up with good reason from principles and reasons that is the basis of your idea. It&rsquo;s hard to do it for yourself because the dialog is less back and forth, it&rsquo;s more jumbled in your head as both personalities in your mind come from the same person.</p>
<p>I have had many problems trying to do my own site and it is embarrassing to tell people. My site hasn&rsquo;t been updated for the last 7 years, and it&rsquo;s beginning to hurt now in my freelance. I have been lucky that I get referrals so delaying my own promotions was too easy to push aside.</p>
<p>With the recent lack of clients in the last few months it&rsquo;s been a very good lesson for me. It&rsquo;s very humbling to look back and know how lucky I have been and appreciate security when I had it.</p>
<p>So finally, I have pushed myself to &ldquo;define&rdquo; myself through a website, a new business card because I just moved and all this worry and small pain has been humbling&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe all this delay is that I am don&rsquo;t have the personality to promote myself. I always believed that my work says more than what I have to say for myself to new clients and friends. However when you don&rsquo;t have work coming through you realize it is not about being brave to let the work speak for itself&hellip; it&rsquo;s more about getting people&rsquo;s attention that you are around in their minds.</p>
<ol>
<li>List the reasons why you are doing what you &ldquo;need&rdquo; to do for yourself in order to get your work out there..</li>
<li>Stick to that agenda and give yourself a deadline.</li>
<li>Promise yourself a reward if you do complete it on time.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are all perfectionists but how perfect can we be when it never gets done?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you are not alone, Eric. Most of my design school buddies, and even some designers I worked for after I graduated, either had the same problem or made knowing jokes about it. For example, there is an old Spanish saying, &ldquo;En casa de herrero, cuchillo de palo.&rdquo; An English equivalent would be, &ldquo;The mechanic&rsquo;s car never runs.&rdquo; (The Spanish phrase translates as &ldquo;In the blacksmith&rsquo;s home, the knives are made of wood.&quot;)</p>
<p>It took me forever to come up with my own letterhead and business cards, after many false starts. And like other designers, I was never happy with the solutions I came up with for myself!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of truth in everything kidcranium says&hellip; Approach the problem as if it were for a third party &ndash; list the clients' objectives, try to put down in writing what &ldquo;their&rdquo; design philosophy is, etc. Giving myself a deadline has worked for me as well. Also, I show my comps to fellow designers, to try to get some objective criticism. You will always have blind spots when you design for yourself&hellip; It&rsquo;s good to have another designer look at things with a cold eye.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t like designing for myself, and I&rsquo;m rarely happy with the result for more than two weeks, if even that long.</p>
<p>The Finnish proverb related to those mentioned by Ricardo is &ldquo;Suutarin lapsilla ei ole kenkiä.&rdquo; That is Cobbler&rsquo;s (Shoemaker&rsquo;s) children don&rsquo;t have shoes. I&rsquo;ve heard it so many times by various designers, they just say &ldquo;shoemaker&rsquo;s children&hellip;&rdquo; and shrug their shoulders and roll their eyes.</p>
<p>I try to have a fairly strict colour and font system and do something that feels right and maybe looks like me. I ask my family&rsquo;s opinion and if possible, some other designers' thoughts. Christmas cards are usually done in last minute, so there&rsquo;s no time to dwell on them too long.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Design is always easier when you know who you&rsquo;re talking to. So imagine a scenario whereby Prospective Client A says to Delegating Authority B, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found a designer.&rdquo; Delegating Authority B is going to say, &ldquo;Oh really? Who?&rdquo; Design all of your own materials to impress Delegating Authority B. 
Or, said another way, every prospective client has somebody they want/need to impress; when you are designing your own identity that somebody is your real target audience. 
And knowing that you are addressing a fictitious, harried, socially higher-ranking third party who is responsible for the decisions and actions of subordinates and who&rsquo;s daily function is to stand as a symbol of their own skills in coordinating the work of others should make things a whole lot easier.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like designing for myself  but I agree that it&rsquo;s a challenge. Being your own client means that you have no one to blame if the result is  not as good as  you want it to be. A few times I have designed the logo and the corporate identity for the design studio where I have been employed. It&rsquo;s a good opportunity to push yourself forward and to show your clients how great a designer you are, but at the same time it&rsquo;s a place you really don&rsquo;t want to do something mediocre. For a graphic designer the business card has a quite unique marketing value. A space where you can and should show what you can do. That is probably why so many designers think it&rsquo;s difficult and a bit scary. 
Here is the logo and the business card I did for Melkeveien where i work today.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/selfpromotion_melkeveien_5003.jpg]</div>

The reason is that I have had some nice clients (well known) and some less known but I was able to be more creative.  I am weighing up whether to do a unique card with graphics, or show my past work. The reason is that I illustrate as well as design, so I have some collage work, vector cartoons, and fashion illustrations. I also caption each side with small sized type to say who the client is and which country the project is from&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I had a client that grew up under me and really dominated my time. That went on for many years (like eight!) and nothing I did for them really was interesting—blah, blah, blah. When it came time to do cards and web and all the pieces associated I did some illustration just to inject a bit of myself and add some flavor to the whole thing. It was my attempt to say, yes I&rsquo;ve helped these clients achieve what they wanted, but I am capable to doing something more interesting as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always avoided having a signature look or style because I thought it would be in and then go away. I also see so much same. Now I really question that. Who knows? Looks like I&rsquo;m about to move so I&rsquo;ll have a chance to rethink everything again.</p>

I&rsquo;ll wake up in the middle of the night to go to the loo and i&rsquo;ll have a better idea just sitting on the loo. Haha. Even funnier!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Ricardo &amp; mili: same in portuguese! We say “em casa de ferreiro, espeto de pau”, which means “at a blacksmith&rsquo;s house, the spit is wooden”, but since it&rsquo;s understood, we end up just saying the first part, “em casa de ferreiro…”. That&rsquo;s pretty interesting! Though probably it shouldn&rsquo;t be that amazing; it would probably be really amazing if we found something similar in an asian or african culture.</p>
<p>Anyways, yes, definitely, totally, designing for ourselves is tough. I have no suggestions and I like – and have tried – some of these, but they&rsquo;re really hard to follow. As a designer, we kind of have the totally unrealistic job of summarizing entire personalities into one little piece. We rarely fully achieve that, but we still keep on doing it.
It&rsquo;s a lot easier when it&rsquo;s all about someone else, as it is a lot easier to give advice to others than to make decisions about our own lives. It&rsquo;s a bit about perspective. It&rsquo;s also about us not wanting to oversimplify ourselves and our lives – as someone already mentioned –, since we, human beings, like to think of ourselves as quite complex, and that&rsquo;s really a good thing. I think that we should probably try working for ourselves much more often, and I think that the day you fully understand yourself, your own thoughts and ideas, your personality, what you think matters, what you really want… that day you become a MUCH better designer and, more importantly, a much better YOU (in a sense that you&rsquo;ll probably become much more yourself than ever). Which I think is also rare. :P
I think that&rsquo;s the ultimate challenge. This is actually an internal fight between the person we truly are and the person we would like to be and/or the person we would like others to think we are. It&rsquo;s really us trying to choose what&rsquo;s more important: appearances or true essence. And that&rsquo;s probably the only time we realize that, when we do stuff for other people, we are, in fact, putting this dilemma aside in exchange for money.</p>
<p>So, heck! This should be hard! No suggestions for you! :P</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s my first post here on Typophile so hello to everyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I stumbled upon this topic cause I&rsquo;ve been thinking and discussing it a lot with my friends lately. I have rather web-design background so some of the stuff I&rsquo;ll say may seem irrelevant to some of you.  I&rsquo;ve been struggling to come up with a good logotype and portfolio design for a few months now. I finally made it—at least I hope so—but the whole process was a pain in the neck. Here is what I realized:</p>
<p><strong>Have a clear idea of what you&rsquo;re design should be like</strong>
It may be so obvious, but many people find themselves acting to make a design not having even a slightly organized thoughts on it.. I see a lot of guys launching their design tools and trying to come up with some cool instant prototypes. Seeking inspiration is crucial here.</p>
<p><strong>Make no deadlines</strong>
Of course, you have to have a deadline when delivering a project, but if you can afford to wait—do so, don&rsquo;t rush it. Bad, fast decisions can cost you a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Stick to the idea, but starting from scratch isn&rsquo;t always that bad</strong>
Initially I wanted to design myself a nice graphic/web-design portfolio with some extensive usage of Helvetica, somehow I ended up having a vintage-like design full of sans-serif typefaces. I&rsquo;m glad I changed my mind in the middle of the designing process cause I&rsquo;m pretty much satisfied with the result, but abandoning work on half-finished project is not what everyone can do.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s awful unless you really think it&rsquo;s beautiful</strong>
If your not satisfied with a button or a small element of the whole you may want to work on it but if you&rsquo;re having second thoughts on the whole design line you should consider changing it. That&rsquo;s what I did with the Helvetica-based theme.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll find some of these useful if not obvious.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Piotr</p>
