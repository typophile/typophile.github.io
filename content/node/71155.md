  the task of making a magazine for high school aged youth. I can manage the layout
  program, am OK with photos, but know sweet nuthin' about typefaces.\r\n\r\nI would
  like to know your opinion on some youthful typefaces for body text, paragraph heading,
  and even the title of the 'zine.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nM"

  body: "This sounds like a great opportunity to involve the students in the writing,
    editing and design process. You can be the art director and manage the student
    teams. First, you might have students bring in magazines they like (if HS students
    still read magazines), then you can dissect the typefaces, grid and so on. Which
    will inform your layout decisions for your own magazine.\r\n\r\nDo HS-aged youth
    still read magazines? When I was in high school I read Adbusters, Thrasher, and
    towards the end I remember reading Speak! and then on to Emigre. I also read the
    Burton catalog every fall until it fell apart in my hands. So what I'm really
    saying is that HS-students might like typographically sophisticated publications.
    I would advise not to condescend with \"youth-looking\" typefaces like comic sans.\r\n\r\nIf
    I was you, I might take a look at youworkforthem.com for headline faces, as their
    work is nothing if not contemporary and youthful (plus inexpensive).\r\n\r\nBut
    again, HS-aged people are intelligent. So it really might depend on appropriately
    matching the typography with content.\r\n\r\nOr hire a suitable designer/director
    to run the workshop and make the zine a collaboration with the students.\r\n"

    \"structural shortfall\" in education budgets. So you likely can't hire anyone.\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    content + audience = typographic decisions to be made. \r\n\r\nWhat's it about?"

  body: "tmac - Some kids still read, but only if they are stuck in a place without
    their electronics, say, the remand centre. Thanks for understanding that this
    will be a 'labour of love' and not one I can outsource (sorry B+, it's amateur
    hour). I will check out the foundries, but I like your idea about building a morgue
    of mags that they admire and reversing the process from there. Parents will also
    read the publication (we hope); sophistication will not be lost. \r\n\r\nThx.\r\n\r\ntypodermic

  body: "When it comes to body text, I would think that the youngsters would have
    the same preferences as old fogies; something readable.\r\n\r\nAssuming you have
    a good general selection of typefaces at your disposal - such as is provided with
    WordPerfect - you could try Optima, as a readable sans-serif. Or Palatino, if
    Garamond, or Baskerville, or Century Expanded are too old, and Times Roman too
    overused.\r\n\r\nYou could even use Kabel (or Geometric 231) if you were so minded.
    That was intensely fashionable in the 1920s, it is true, but its popularity is
    perennial.\r\n\r\n(I may be giving you bad advice, though, but not deliberately.
    Were I intent on doing that, I would commend Papyrus and Comic Sans to your attention;
    as it is, they are faces generally avoided by typographers of taste, despite their
    overuse.)"
