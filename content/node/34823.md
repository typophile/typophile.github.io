    200dpi OLPC screen.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>200dpi</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was news to
    me, because I guess I hadn't been paying much attention to the display side of
    the OLPC story. Oh, and apparently the subpixel stripes are diagonal. Very cool.\r\n\r\nThis
    rather supports the theory that the reason screen displays have not improved in
    resolution as anticipated ten years ago is that most commercial software doesn't
    scale well, not because of inherent difficulty or cost in making higher resolution
    screens."

  body: The 200dpi may be a bit misleading as it includes subpixels (so I hear) so
    in color mode it may be a bit less. Anyway I think the type holds up pretty well
    even down to small sizes, as I think the screen shots seem to show.

    what's cool about a diagonal subpixel stripe?\r\nWho makes 45-degree Italics?
    :-)  To me it seems\r\nlike a concession to images (think of TVs).\r\n\r\n> This
    rather supports the theory that ...\r\n\r\nNah. The commercial software would
    have scaled well if there was a financial incentive. This instead is evidence
    that the reason we haven't had hi-res screens is simply that there's no money
    in it - people don't want to pay for readability, because they don't really grasp
    what readability is (since, unlike legibility*, it's subconscious). The telling
    difference between OLPC and the commercial world is that the former has a philanthropic
    core...\r\n\r\n* Think 1-bit sans letterforms.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>But what\u2019s cool about a diagonal subpixel stripe?</em>\r\n\r\nUniform
    x and y direction resolution enhancement. It happens that Latin italics tend to
    have slant angles that benefit particularly from vertical subpixel stripes, but
    there are other aspects of Latin letterforms that do not benefit from that arrangement,
    and then of course there is the whole wide world of other writing systems in which
    there is a great diversity of strokes and bowls to be accomodated. Providing uniform
    x and y resolution enhancement accomodates more things better than x direction
    only. The rendering of Latin italics might not be as good -- but at 200 dpi, who
    is going to notice? --, but many other things should be better (Arabic, for example,
    and other writing systems with strong horizontal features and shallow curves).\r\n\r\n"

    didn't say it did. I don't know what the native resolution is. As I said, this
    is news to me. Do a Google search on olpc 200dpi for more information."

    \"writing\" is horizontal (in more ways than one).\r\n\r\nMy gut feeling is that
    uniformity is a lost opportunity.\r\nBut my gut has been wrong before.\r\n\r\n>
    I didn\u2019t say it did.\r\n\r\nI didn't say you did. :-)  Simon did.\r\n\r\nBut
    especially since the subpixels are on a diagonal there's no indication as to how
    it's really being measured. Also, I'm confused about this monochrome/color difference,
    especially when it comes to factoring in the subpixeling...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
