  Most of them already have  a cyrillic version but my boss insists on doing everything
  from scratch. I am learning on the go.\r\n Perhas most people will not understand
  the cyr letterforms, but general art aspects of the font should be plainly visible
  for critique.\r\n Also, the fonts will soon be on sale for low low prices. :)\r\n\r\nFirst
  number one...\r\nhttp://img297.imageshack.us/img297/4110/mistralcyr.jpg"

    Cyrillic</a> (part of the multilingual typeface now available from <a href=\"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/mistral-standard.aspx\">Ascender
    Corp.)</a> quite usable; it\u2019s pretty hard to beat. Second, depending on the
    prospective use, and the terms of the license, your boss may have to secure the
    consent of the copyright owner to get a custom version developed for him.<ul><li><em>Also,
    the fonts will soon be on sale for low low prices. </em>:)</li></ul>Think twice
    before you offer your unauthorized Cyrillic versions of the existing Western typefaces
    for sale without proper arrangements with the copyright owners: in certain jurisdictions
    that is considered illegal, and could land you in jail. :-("
