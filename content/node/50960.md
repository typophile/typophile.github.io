body: "There are two new trends in Arabic typography that need to be critically discussed
  by the designer and user community.\r\n\r\nOne trend is Huda Smitshuijzen AbiFares'
  Typographic Matchmaking effort  (www.khtt.net) where Arab type designers have been
  paired with master designers of Latin type to produce Arabic fonts that match the
  Latin in style. I feel the experience of working with master designers cannot but
  have a positive impact on the technical quality of any resulting type. On the other
  hand there is the inherent danger that the resulting Arabic glyphs are constrained
  in style and proportion to match the x height of the Latin. What is the best way
  for two fonts of very different languages to appear harmoniously on the same page?
  \r\n\r\nAnother important trend, Tasmeem, is a plug-in to Adobe's Middle East version
  of InDesign released by Winsoft www.winsoft-international.com . This is the result
  of years of research and effort by Tom Milo and his team at Decotype www.decotype.com.
  Here the software automatically manipulates the placement of a small number of component
  glyphs to produce type for the full range of Arabic and related languages, allowing
  the precise control of spacing, the choice of glyph variants, and the exact placements
  of dots and vowels. Tasmeem was originally conceived to display traditional calligraphic
  styles. How will the software work with newer more geometrical styles of Arabic?\r\n\r\nI
  have drawn the following cartoon to show my personal take on these efforts, which
  are both based in Holland. The Matchmakers are to the left, while Tasmeem operations
  take place in the center.  A larger-resolution open-license image is also attached.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arabic-Typography@Holland_4074.jpg]"

  body: "BTW, Vladimir: Tasmeem is a new trend in font technology - and an old one
    at the same time, because the underlying ACE engine has been around for quite
    a while and was Microsoft's proof-of-concept for was later to become Open Type.\r\n\r\nTasmeem
    is totally transparent regarding Arabic typography, so one cannot seriously raise
    a debate about Tasmeem relative to \"matchmaking\". Tasmeem can handle such typography
    just as well as any other approach to Arabic script.\r\n\r\nThe real trends are
    Design vs. Modelling of Arabic script. Modeling was the original business of all
    typographers, design is by now a no longer new secondary approach to Arabic typography.
    Computer Modelling however is technically speaking new, it attempts to document,
    analyse and synthesize classic styles and typfaces and make them available as
    Arabic typography.\r\n\r\nACE is very suitable for Computer Modelling, whereas
    OpenType is less useful for this approach. Yet is has been attempted at least
    once, as can be seen in the MS Arabic typesetting font. I believe Diwan's Mushafi
    font is also an OpenType computer model. On the other hand there s nothing in
    matchmaking to date that ACE couldn't handle. In fact, our new template approach
    to Tasmeem Font Design will make life of matchmakers, too, a lot easier. After
    all, the graphic template is supported by an invisible logic and unicode template.
    Your own Al Quds Tasmeemi - a good example of matchmaking - displays the famous
    Afghani Rahman Baba poem perfectly - in Pashto.\r\n\r\nSummarizing: Tasmeem and
    Matchmaking ar not playing in the same league, a comparison is a non-starter.
    They are not at odds with each other. Nor are Design vs Modelling. They exist
    side by side.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n \r\nThomas Milo\r\nDecoType\r\nwww.decotype.com"

    have so many choices, Arabic users should too. The way to do it is to *believe*
    in users (not to speak on their behalf) and keep options *wide* open.  This openness
    was the reason behind the golden days for Arabic, but we should not keep rehearsing
    past successes only but also make new advances and learn past lessons. Making
    fixed design rules or allowing only limited fixed flavors, would eventually destroy
    the Arabic script. \r\n\r\nWhile I do not think we should forbid matchmaking or
    even criticize it, I personally do not think matchmaking would be the ideal or
    significant way to advance Arabic typography. I do not see value for Arabic in
    fixed x-heights, for example. I believe designers should look to the rich history
    of Arabic shapes for innovation, and understand the rich lessons of typography
    as a field, Latin, or else, to apply in Arabic.  Arabic type designers' heroes
    need not be necessarily those of Latin typography, but those of Arabic typography
    and calligraphy.\r\n\r\nI see Tom Milo's work as a significant breakthrough. Over
    the years, his dedication had made him \"shaykh al-Musammimeen\". Still, I had
    never seen the value of his work as being the right or the wrong typography.  I
    see it as a great Arabic typography work. He is therefore a real Arabic typography
    hero. \r\n\r\nMatchmaking is OK as long as it is not presented as the way Arabic
    typography \"should\" be. It is ok as long as it is not turned into a vehicle
    to exercise censorship and  disrespect to others, or to use as a way to promote
    personal resumes by coupling up with shiny Latin Typography names! What was disturbing
    in that project was not the project itself, but the fact it was coupled with comments
    to \"redicule\" great Arbabic typography works like that of Decotype.\r\n\r\n-Saad

  body: "Dear Vladimir,\r\nIt's a very interesting point that you raise though I disagree
    with the premise of the argument. I find that in the recent period there has been
    a needless politicizing of Arabic typography in which projects are labeled as
    either a Huda or a Thomas approach. This is problematic to the field and I truly
    believe that we should snap out of this mind set.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there
    are new trends emerging in Arabic type design and though they might fall along
    the lines you describe, there are other ways to look at this. \r\n\r\nSome designers
    are more interested in the resulting visual aesthetic (for example, an Arabic
    companion to a famous Latin typeface) and there are those who are interested in
    investigating the complex structural aspects of the script (and that's where Tasmeem
    sits). In the first camp, the end result is a product intended for a specific
    use (a text face, a signage face etc...) while the second camp is an approach
    to design rather than a product in itself. \r\n\r\nThis is why I would argue against
    a split between what you describe as 2 trends. It would be quite feasible to design
    an Arabic version of a Latin typeface using Tasmeem technology. It is true that
    in designing an Arabic counterpart to an existing Latin there are a lot of considerations
    that need to be taken, but it does not necessarily mean that the basic characteristics
    of the script are being sacrificed. \r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of publicity regarding
    the Typographic Matchmaking project and as one of the designers, I can easily
    say that it's been taken a bit out of context. As far as I know, none of the designers
    looked at their designs as the \"one solution\" to the question of Arabic type
    design. The process of working alongside more experienced type designers and learning
    from them was the whole point of the exercise, at least for me. It was a great
    experience and we all benefited. \r\n\r\nThe Typographic Matchmaking project was
    not the first, and is not the last, to approach the concept of an Arabic match
    to existing Latin. It is a legitimate question, not because Arabic needs to follow
    a Latin, but because of the demands of the market place. This demand exists and
    the perils of graphic designers taking things into their own hands can be seen
    in the streets of Dubai where cut-and-paste Latin characters masquerade as Arabic.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, I think we should rejoice in the fact that so many people are interested
    in exploring new ideas. It's a very exciting period to live in.\r\n"

    would be quite feasible to design an Arabic version of a Latin typeface using
    Tasmeem technology.</cite>\r\n\r\nPut differently, TMM could as well have used
    ACE technology* instead of OT technology. OT layout tables are mere technology,
    ACE is mere technology, and both can be used for whatever kind of design.\r\nThe
    difference is their architecture and how suited each is for the task at hand (laying
    out Arabic script). This affects not only elegance of the respective approach
    but also reduction of complexity -- how easy is it for designers to create fonts
    of various degrees of complexity. The last aspect is not unimportant. If the reason
    for typefaces to be kept \"simple\" is restrictions of the technology, then something
    went terribly wrong. Technology should be gentle and allow for whatever may make
    sense. And whether designers prefer simplified or complex designs should be entirely
    driven by their design visions, not by technology or by their ability or inability
    to master it. With OpenType, I fear that often it is indeed the latter than determines
    design.\r\n\r\nOne tiny correction. In the opposition which you sketch there is
    a misconception which is also at the heart of the (to me) silly ACE vs TMM debate:\r\n\r\n<cite>Some
    designers are more interested in the resulting visual aesthetic (for example,
    an Arabic companion to a famous Latin typeface) and there are those who are interested
    in investigating the complex structural aspects of the script (and that's where
    Tasmeem sits).</cite>\r\n\r\nThis neglects an important point: Analysing the structure
    of a script (in this case Arabic) is <em>necessary condition</em> for developing
    technology which in turn serves as vehicle for actual fonts which incorporate
    this or that design. In so far, Thomas did the ground work on which results others
    can base their (design) work.\r\n(In this respect, of course not only ACE but
    also the architecture of OT layout tables is based on analysis of one or more
    scripts. Which again raises the single relevant question -- which analysis and
    thus technology is more appropriate?)\r\n\r\nReading Vladimir's original post
    again, I find that this is in the first place about different approaches to design.
    The one visible in TMM typefaces and DecoType's which is more traditional. The
    mentioning of Tasmeem or ACE in this context is a bit misleading because it mixes
    different levels. Or does the question \"How will the software work with newer
    more geometrical styles of Arabic?\" indicate that the design level is independent
    of the technology level?\r\n\r\n* Not \"Tasmeem technology\". ACE is the technology,
    Tasmeem makes use of it. Just like OT is the technology of which InDesign makes
    use. As an analogy, you would not say that Linotype offers \"InDesign fonts\",
    I assume.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\n[Says someone who is ignorant of Arabic but highly

    Typography. Matchmaking is a sound idea only insofar as that two languages on
    the same page should not appear to compete for attention without reason. Since
    the mid-sixties the Arab press is favoring the use of Latinized Arab numerals
    012345 (rather than the Indic numerals). The  fonts often used for the numerals
    is awfully mismatched and jumps out of the line in a disturbing way.  The glory
    of Arabic script is the compact and curvatious lines and highly developed sense
    of the individuality of each letter-shape. It is written in a totally different
    spirit than Latin with its blocks of same-height letters and repeated forms. \r\n\r\n<em>It
    is true that there are new trends emerging in Arabic type design and though they

    Nadine. You are specially welcome here as it is good to hear the views of someone
    in a position to know much more about what is going on in the market and design
    community than any one of us as individuals.  The cartoon did not depict the many
    other significant developments going on in Arabic font design, only to deal with
    the topical subject of the panel discussion that took place last week in Amsterdam.
    I hope to learn more about what occurred there.  \r\nI should explain a bit more
    about why I find the Matchmaking vs. Tasmeem so necessary to discuss critically.
    It has now become technically possible to present scripts of any imaginable complexity
    by programming the software under the hood. That is what Tom and his Tasmeem team
    have done so brilliantly for Arabic, and designers and font developers should
    explore its possibilities not only for calligraphic styles such as Naskh. More
    about that later. \r\n In contrast my impression is that  Huda\u2019s Matchmaking
    effort holds Latin as the ideal to which Arabic should aspire. This is indeed
    sad. Doubtless Latin type has had centuries of a head start over Arabic (or Japanese
    or Telugu) but each script has an essential design philosophy that should be respected
    even as the shapes adapt to modern techniques and prevailing design fashions.
    The khtt group has succeeded nicely to encourage young people to take an interest
    in Arabic typography, and Tasmeem is making headway among printing and publishing
    professionals. It is high time the two teams in Holland cooperate in some ways
    to further promote the field as a whole. Arabic typography and font design can
    only benefit. \r\n\r\n<em>The question is why nobody thought of matching Roman
    script to Arabic?!</em>\r\nBehnam, I have recently designed a Latin font to match
    in style, stem width and line endings the Arabic of my forthcoming AlQuds font.
    I am now newly aware how difficult it is to design a really good Latin font!\r\n\r\n<em>It
    would be quite feasible to design an Arabic version of a Latin typeface using
    Tasmeem technology</em>  \r\nKarsten, not only of Latin, insofar as I understand
    its workings, Tasmeem is an intelligent-font technology that can be adapted to
    any script. \r\n\r\nAs Aziz would say, with tulips.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    up new fonts for Jazm, the earliest Arabic script which is directly related to
    early Kufi, just to illustrate this point.\r\n\r\n>> How is the Matchmaking project
    any different than what happened in the past?\r\n\r\nI think the main problem
    of Matchmaking concept is that it \u201Csucks up\u201D (unnecessarily) to Latin!
    To start, I would re-iterate Vladimir and Behnam points, harmonizing two scripts
    is two way process.  We do need to incorporate good typographic design concepts
    and ideas used in Latin (or other scripts) as good design concepts not as Latin
    design concepts; just as driving a car today in not \u201CWesternization\u201D
    or studying \u201CAl-Jabr\u201D (Algebra) is not \u201CArabization\u201D. Typography
    is an independent field, re-using design concepts used for Latin, does not owe
    a \u201Cpenny\u201D to Latin, but to Typography. What bothers me the most about
    the Matchmaking is that young designers are sitting down to design Arabic fonts
    in general (not to fulfill a specific harmonizing project need) but having harmonizing
    with Latin as the main goal and drive.  People around the world do not drive cars
    to match western civilization look, do they?\r\n\r\nSecondly, despite the fact
    that anyone of us can learn from colleagues around the world, one must be careful
    not to give the impression that a well known Latin type designer can have any
    significant input for Arabic type design without being *significantly and sufficiently
    involved* in the field. Otherwise this would become just a \u201Cphoto opportunity\u201D
    to look good.\r\n\r\n-Saad  \r\n"

    a disturbing way.\r\n\r\nThis was actually a good phenomenon that went wrong because
    of laziness or perhaps due to that Matchmaking mentality. In all my fonts, I take
    time to redesign these numbers to match the Arabic text, in a clear bias decision.
    \r\n\r\n>>The glory of Arabic script is the compact and curvatious lines and highly
    developed sense of the individuality of each letter-shape. It is written in a
    totally different spirit than Latin with its blocks of same-height letters and

    an extreme. We need to address, additionally, typography, without requiring blindly
    rules of calligraphy and handwritting.  As Latin typography succeeded to do to
    some extend, Arabic typography should rid itself from that \u201Canal typography\u201D

    the views of someone in a position to know much more about what is going on in

    Arabetic font market needs wide options.  Designers need to design, present, and

    as 30%! No one should be in a position to deprive Arabic from this natural basic
    right.\r\n\r\n>>It has now become technically possible to present scripts of any

    is great news indeed, but it should not be used as call to \u201Ckeep\u201D intact
    complex scribing and calligraphy rules as rules of typography. As I wrote in one
    of my articles a \u201Ctechnology friendly font is a font independent of technology\u201D.

    I must say that we are in uncharted times...globalization is causing us to think
    in new ways as to the balance between cultural identity and interconnectivity.
    A thousand years ago, did we need to \"shoehorn\" one script into another? Again,
    because of the times, I think it's inevitable.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, I think
    this Matchmaking trend COULD go the other way too! Why not \"shoehorn\" Latin
    into Arabic. That would be sweet. :) \r\n\r\nI think the main fear is that \"Americanization\"
    (I'm from the US, by the way) is robbing the world of it's distinct people groups
    and cultures. Fair enough. I agree wholeheartedly. Yemen is special because it's
    so un-American (for the time being). But if it wasn't America, it would be somebody
    else. The fact is, we're all being squished together and we need ways to be interconnected.
    There is going to be some trade-off on all sides. \r\n\r\nLooking at it another
    way, could we say the same thing about interracial marriages? (Boy, this is a
    dangerous opener!) Do we lament the fact that a dark-skinned and light-skinned
    couple has a baby that's brown? I'm not even saying it's wrong to dislike that.
    I like living in Yemen, where the distinctive features of the people immediately
    set me apart visually. Are we all going to be brown in 1000 years? I don't think
    so, because there will always be people who prefer their own race. (Like we will
    always have true Nasque fonts) And that makes me happy too. I know I'm not comparing
    apples to apples, but in an odd way I see a connection.\r\n\r\nAnd forgive me
    for making the connection if I'm in error, but on your Arabetics site (www.arabetics.com),
    several of your fonts appear to be using Basic Arabic. Isn't that worse than Matchmaking?

    the epitome of \"sucking up.\" (I don't mean this disrespectfully.)\r\n\r\nMy

    real name.\r\n\r\n@Vladimir\r\nI knew I was going to be sorry for saying Latin
    was \"fixed/blocky\" since we all know there is a cursive script. But thank you
    for your feedback as well. I think I also responded to your comment in the above
    statements.\r\n\r\nI really like this forum topic, though. I think the central
    question remains, \"Just because I CAN do something, doesn't mean I SHOULD do
    it.\" That's why we're designers. We're hired to be discretionary.\r\n\r\n\r\nwith

    a harmonious Arabic and Latin is an exercise which does *not* necessarily mean
    that the Arabic is subservient to Latin, or that it looses any of its qualities\r\n\r\n.
    The Matchmaking project is actually 5 different approaches to this problem, and
    should not be bundled in one lump\r\n\r\n. There are many different ways to look
    at this exercise and many different ways to solve the problem. For example, compare
    my typefaces: Koufiya with Frutiger Arabic and Palatino Arabic\r\n\r\nKoufiya:
    Both Latin and Arabic were designed at the same time; both were treated in a way
    that they work together but they do not sacrifice their integrity. The Arabic
    relates to Early Kufi.\r\n\r\nFrutiger Arabic: the Arabic was designed to work
    as a signage font that can sit on the same signage system as the Latin. As it
    is meant to be seen in large sizes, the drawing treatment is similar to the Latin,
    and the style is a mix of Kufi and Ruqaa.\r\n\r\nPalatino Arabic: the Arabic was
    designed to function as a bookface and is Naskh in style. The actual drawing style
    does not follow the Latin, but the optical size and weight are a match. This approach
    is on a more ideological level.\r\n\r\n\r\n. As we stand today, we have a tradition
    of complexity in our manuscripts as well as a much simplified version in our traditional
    typefaces. The simplification was a result of technological limitations that barely
    exist today. However, the legacy of this simplified style exists, so do we keep
    it on even though the reasons for it have disappeared? Is there any typographic
    value in Simplified Naskh?\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in these questions, please
    wait till I finish my PhD in legibility studies! I'm testing the effect of complexity
    on the legibility of Arabic and I'm hoping to get some answers... I'm sorry I

  body: "The visibility of Arabic script is a matter of vertical space. The line spacing
    in the font.\r\nBeside the obvious physical law, that anything in smaller size
    is less visible than in larger size, there is absolutely no visibility problem
    with Arabic script... unless it is viewed through the Roman eyes.\r\nBut looking
    at it through the Roman eyes is completely unnecessary. Because Roman fonts do
    not need Arabic.\r\nIf there is a special project which requires materials in
    Arabic and Roman, tastefully selecting an Arabic font on one hand, and choosing
    a Roman font on the other, can do the job eloquently.\r\nBut Roman in Arabic fonts
    is needed for everyday use and for such font, Roman characters have ample room
    to position themselves properly beside Arabic characters.\r\n\r\nThere is a couple
    of exceptions however, that Roman fonts do need to contain Arabic. Fonts that
    provide some technical support to a device for its functionality, or technical
    support for functionality of communication between devices. Fixed width fonts
    and OS system fonts are of that nature and reasonably they should be considered
    as Roman fonts containing Arabic.\r\nThe issue of visibility only arise in such
    context. Meaning when Arabic script is deployed in a font fundamentally Roman.\r\nFor
    fixed width fonts, there is practically no expectation for aesthetics and Courier
    New for example, is quite successful to provide an Arabic support for what it
    intends to do. There is no typographic expectation.\r\nFor system fonts, the situation
    is complicated. They need to include Arabic for technical support but they can't
    provide the typographic needs of the script. Yet their presence is highly noticeable.\r\nThe
    abomination of Microsoft's Tahoma for Arabic script (which has now apparently
    become a school of thought!) was actually a creative approach to address the visibility
    issue of Arabic script within a Roman system font. For Arabic script in a Roman
    font, the choice is between shrinking the characters to fit the Roman line space
    (therefore visibility problem), or chopping off the script and maintaining the
    same magnification as the Roman characters. Tahoma chose the second and successfully
    so, for what it intended to do. But what it intended to do, by no means was to
    create an Arabic font.\r\nApple in Mac OS 10 initially had the same approach as
    Tahoma, with its system font Lucida Grande. But after the first or second update,
    this approach was abandoned to address the problem of noticeable presence of system
    font in Arabic rendering.\r\nThe system font of Mac OS 10 now allocate Arabic
    rendering to a specifically designed Arabic font called Geeza Pro. This is a very
    well rounded simplified Naskh font and although it hasn't resolved yet the spacing
    and somewhat the magnification issue, but it does address the noticeability issue
    and the Arabic rendering at system level on a Mac is quite good.\r\nI think this
    is the approach that should be considered when for technical reasons a fundamentally
    Roman font needs to provide Arabic support too.\r\n\r\nSo the issue is not visibility.
    It's the space. Zapfino is not less visible than Times. It only needs more space.
    And this is *not* a deficiency. For the same magnification, Arabic script needs
    more space. This also is not a 'deficiency' to be 'fixed'. The difference is that
    for Roman script Zapfino is a design choice. For Arabic it is inherent to the
    script.\r\n \r\nWhen the space is inherent to the script, designer can only play
    within and around that space. And why should you do it otherwise if you are designing
    an Arabic font? Of-course the creativity can go anywhere it wants. It can increase
    or decrease the vertical space of the characters. But it is very important to
    emphasize that this creativity should be through Arabic eyes, not Roman.\r\nI'm
    drafting this text with an Arabic font that I made with this concept. It provides
    perfectly balanced visibility and magnification for both Arabic and Roman. This
    balance is necessary for Arabic use in which Roman is vastly present. And although
    this Arabic font is not intended for Roman only text, the text I'm drafting right
    now is quite acceptable for non professional use. This Arabic font does not cut
    off head and legs of Roman characters. All it does is that it puts a little more
    line spacing that is a tad excessive for Roman only use.\r\nUnless there is a
    technical purpose, Roman font makers need not include Arabic to their fonts.\r\n\r\n"

    the test could take into account earlier discussions about what is actually measured,

    Is it enough to measure speed?)\r\nThe crucial question is, what will the test
    prove? For example, whatever will turn out to be more legible by whatever definition
    (to be defined) and under whatever test set-up (to be documented) -- will the
    result indicate that this or that kind of design is more legible per se? Or does
    it acknowledge that readers (participants) are used to, and thus trained in, reading
    it, and read it more \"fluently\"?\r\n\r\nTwo aspects: Make sure participants
    are not just students but cover all ages and type. And ask if and what they usually
    read -- after the test. So, have academic vs non-academic, young vs old people,
    which at the same time may help bring together people who read books, or newspapers,
    or online (TV captions?), or not at all. (Maybe even ask what kind of books and
    which newspaper(s), where possible check in which typeface these are set.) That
    way, one would not get some \"abstract\" information about typeface's legibility

    I was waiting on a response from someone regarding this forum. They never replied,
    so I&rsquo;m just moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>See, I told you I would be put
    in my place. I am truly asking these questions as a learner. I looked up the two
    typefaces (if we can call them that?) and in a cursory search only found info
    on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Arabian_alphabet\"> Musnad </a>
    which I do indeed recognize. It&rsquo;s written on the old Marib Dam from the
    Sabaen days. They also used it in Ethiopia, since Saba extended there too. The
    other example, Jazm I couldn&rsquo;t find.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t
    have said all disconnected letters = Latin. I guess I just didn&rsquo;t understand
    the reason the characters in your fonts were disconnected, and it reminded me
    of Basic Arabic, which seems to be along the same lines as Matchmaking, only with
    less integrity. So I assumed it was a bow to Latin or western perspective. But
    thank you for correcting me.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>However, your argument leads me to
    support Matchmaking even more. Arabic is even more flexible than I imagined!</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I
    also appreciate your online friendliness, Saad. It is refreshing.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>@behnam

    Because it&rsquo;s so drop&ndash;dead gorgeous to see the two together! It&rsquo;s

    is the cure&ndash;all. But in some settings, I think it works best. But perhaps
    you will convince me otherwise.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>Behnam mentions he developed
    an Arabic font. Several others here I&rsquo;m sure have too. Why don&rsquo;t we
    put several cases side&ndash;by&ndash;side? I took an example of one of the Matchmaking
    typefaces (Nadine&rsquo;s Frutiger Arabic), and put it next to a couple &ldquo;correct&rdquo;
    (I assume?) typefaces. This is only a starting point, and I am not suggesting
    my alternates are improvements. But I have included the source files for the below

    an intelligent-font technology, it allows the user to interact with it to produce
    the desired effect. OT type is a 'take-it-or-leave-it' matter- the inputted text

    examples you gave for \u0628\u0631\u0643\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0628
    Nadine's Frutiger works best because it matches the logo and the Latin in style.
    It is well designed and belongs to the same genre of Arabic 'sans-serif' styles
    that now has many examples, including my forthcoming AlQuds font, also with  round
    dots.\r\n\r\nIn the image below, I will try to illustrate some responses related
    to the wonderful discussions above. In the early 1960's I read Eric Gill's book
    on typography and designed my AlQuds lettering to make an Arabic font along the
    same lines as his Gill sans-serif. Matchmaking! Yes I must admit it could be described
    as such. More than that Gill himself lived and worked in Jerusalem, so I missed
    meeting him only by a couple of decades and may well have consulted him had I
    done so! But the way I went about it was to keep Gill's designs in the back of
    my mind while I researched early Koranic Arabic calligraphy, newspaper fonts,
    the handwriting of children, modern calligraphy  and many other influences to
    arrive at what I felt was the simple generic shape of Arabic letters. The modern
    embodiment of AlQuds is monoline, while Gill's glyphs have the typical Roman variation
    of thickness. \r\n\r\nSaad, I recently designed a full Latin to match AlQuds's
    style and its six weights, so that would be an example of matchmaking in the other
    'unsucking' direction to use your terminologhy :) having the Latin match the Arabic.
    In the image it is easily seen that Gill's is the superior font, but my AlQuds
    Latin makes up for its shortcomings by matching the Arabic in overall height,
    thickness and the orthogonal line endings. I also designed the Indic and Arabic
    numerals to match the corresponding languages in my font.\r\n\r\nIn the colored
    text I illustrate the point that first made me react against Huda's Matchmaking
    project. In the images khtt published, Latin text's x-height had horizontal guidelines
    within which the Arabic letters were fitted.  Arabic has a potential in-built
    superiority over Latin in that visually each Arabic word is different from the
    other in its word-form. Latin is boxed-in within basically rectangular boxes that
    look much alike. The colored outlines show how the top part and bottom parts of
    the Arabic have a jagged outline indicating some hints of which letters are there,
    while the Latin outlines are just a uniform un-individualized pattern except in
    a few instances. I wrote about this word-shape aspect in 1974 in this article
    \ http://www.khtt.net/article-2603-en.html .\r\n\r\nIn the Arabic matched to Frutiger
    almost each letter tries to fit within a horizontal line even lower than the Latin
    x-height; for example the dal is smaller than usual and the initial tooth of the
    seen reaches upwards to the same height. Let us not throw away the inherent legibility
    advantage of connected Arabic words in the name of modernization, Westernization
    and globalization. \r\n\r\nNadine I hope you will not take my views amiss; and
    I really look forward to seeing the results of your Arabic legibility research.
    Good luck.\r\n\r\nLastly I must admit that my cartoon reflects the envy of an
    old man who had to proofread text in downtown Beirut amid the smoke and smell
    of molten lead cast by Linotype machines, and who had to use Rotring pens and
    white ink on paper to painstakingly draw his letters and correct them, and to
    wait months to wait for an answer to a renown Japanese font designer on how the
    challenges of modern printing were met there.  An envy of Huda's generation with
    access to Fontlab, Illustrator and allied font-making software that makes the
    creation of a 'new' font and its publication and sale a matter of a few mouse-clicks!
    This is wonderful and opens up a world of possibilities, but I sincerely feel
    that we must be the more critical and discriminating in designing, judging and
    using Arabic fonts.\r\n\r\nBenham, I appreciate your perceptive comments on Arabic-related
    fonts, but must you even <em>mention</em> the Turkish disaster that overtook the
    Arabic script there?! :)\r\n\r\nAziz, with flowers\r\n_________________\r\nVladimir

    I just discovered this thread had a second page!\r\nYou can go to http://wiki.irmug.org/index.php/X_Series_2
    and pick any font. They all follow the same concept of magnification between Arabic
    and Roman. Some with more success than the others, in terms of visual harmony.\r\nAs
    you know, I'm not a designer and visual harmony is something I'm improving over
    time. But the visual magnification of all of them follows the same concept I described.\r\nThe
    font I was referring to in my discussion is XB Zar which to me it has the best
    'standard look' for a Persian text. (the site above has XB Zar as default font)
    But it was one of my first fonts and the harmony is not as good as some others.
    But the picture below is of my latest font, XB Kayhan. As I said I'm not a designer.
    My main concern about these fonts is compatibility with Mac platform and language
    coverage. For Mac platform, I have to add AAT. I also add characters to support
    languages of Iran and neighbouring. I thought Afghani people will be too busy
    for a while to have time to make fonts for themselves. So I cover quite a few
    languages.\r\nIn the picture of Kayhan (with its different faces) I mixed a news
    from BBC in Persian and English. I think that should give you an idea.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kayhan_3622.png]"

    on the overall features of the two alphabets (Latin and Arabic), and this is difficult
    because Latin may have such an infinity of stylization nowadays, but not all Latin
    text typefaces conform to ever-evolving models confirmed by \"tradition\".\r\nSome
    of them may have an excess of sophistication, and I consider [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino|Palatino]]
    (used here) among them.\r\nWe tend to recognize it's a matter of taste, but I
    think a typeface like Palatino is objectively too \"refined\" and characterized
    to work perfectly as a book typeface.\r\n\r\n<cite> The regular face has lesser
    harmony and I\u2019m not sure how to explain it. Your remarks were quite good.
    </cite>\r\nTentatively, I'd say it's because of serifs. Latin text types evolved
    over so much time and the variation/structural element provided by serifs proved
    to be important, but most of serif faces new designs (especially from the last
    century), tend to have a feeling of excessive \"finishing\" compared to Arabic,
    which keeps the vigor of \"handwriting\" in models like Naskh.\r\nMy estraneity
    to Arabic does not allow me to completely confirm this, but from what I can judge
    visually, it's something like that\u2026\r\n\r\nPlus, Benham, Arial is the worst
    choice you can make to pair with an Arabic text face. Arial's monotony and homogeneity
    of widths is really far from any Arabic style. Maybe Arabic will look (also) like
    something like Arial in the future, but I hope not\u2026 :=)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is right about the problem of vertical spacing, but it's not always so crucial;

    out excellent because of this, because a theoretical approach should not be seen

    at the same level. My tendency to abstraction and conceptuality would bring me
    close to Saad's daring simplifications, but at the same time I feel the need for
    a typeface to incorporate all the tradition gathered over centuries of history,
    and so I cherish the approach gathering from manuscripts.\r\nShould I approach
    an Arabic typeface, I would get as classical as I can, while having a sort of
    set of \"small capitals\" experimenting along Saad lines\u2026\r\n\r\nMy phrase,
    quoted by Saad, was in fact to say Latin text typography has become too often
    \"excessively slick\". This is fine in many cases, but not for books. For example,
    staying with Zapf, it's fine for Optima but not for Palatino.\r\nIt's clear that
    Aziz has a \"vision\", so do I, but I think we should have deep, complementary
    visions, which may enrich each other, while following the lines of an excessively
    refined approach, like that of Palatino or Arno Pro, ends up in self-closing.\r\n\r\nI
    think this is the reason there is often a misunderstanding about \"calligraphy\"
    or \"chirography\". I do not even remotely think type should be \"separated\"
    from writing, because type is an aspect of writing.\r\nI mean that, no matter
    how you approach letters, letters have a form, and this form is alive. By refining
    it too much, it becomes a representation of life, not life. This tension becomes
    even stronger when letters bring us important things."

    were those open source types or types produced by private designers and offered

    my main concern) was to get my language working on my computer. I was very poorly
    prepared for the issues that you brought-up and when I learned more over time,
    I already had put too much work on my fonts to let them go! Having said that,
    I'm prepared to retract any of my fonts from circulation if there is a conflict.\r\nThe
    Arabic characters were collected from freely distributed fonts, mostly from Iranian
    sites. They already had some Roman for the most part but I often changed them
    to something else to create a better proportionality. I don't even remember were
    I got the Romans because as far as I'm concerned, I wasn't making a Roman font
    at all.\r\nCase in point, this latest Kayhan which I do remember. I knew that
    Kayhan newspaper based on which the font is made, used Palatino for Roman. To
    avoid any discrepancy from the free version I had, I did use the original.\r\nBut
    I don't have a Roman eye. I couldn't possibly instantly recognize Palatino as
    you did, if it wasn't myself who put it there. Roman characters in my fonts -and
    this is not intended to offend anyone- are thought as necessary accessories. Their
    role is to fill out a couple of words here and there within an Arabic text. And
    that is why it is so unacceptable to me that a Roman font dictates how an entire
    Persian text is written.\r\nAnyhow I can track how many fonts I have distributed
    and it is 45 for Kayhan so far. Non of those who downloaded this, couldn't care
    less what was the design of Roman. The mere fact that it is proportionate is all
    they care. The rest, is the font ability to work on the Mac or its language coverage...
    plus the concern that they may have that Arabic  text maybe typesets well!\r\nSo
    I really didn't focus on copyright issues as I should have done. I don't even
    know how I could do it beside giving credit to the fonts based on which my fonts
    are built. As I said I'm prepared to retract my fonts but this will only deprive
    few dozen Afghanis or Kurds or Persians from fonts for their language that they
    will otherwise won't have.\r\n\r\n>>Hrant is right about the problem of vertical

    first portion of reply covers part of this portion. I may not be a suitable person
    for your intended experimentation. If I didn't have to put Roman to cover few
    words here and there, I wouldn't have put it there at all. This is clearly not
    what you have in mind in overall harmonization of Arabic and Roman.\r\n\r\nNow
    if it is not objectionable, I'm quite interested experimenting XB Zar with few
    Roman fonts mentioned by hrant!"

  body: "<em>Claudio is right. Every Arab type designer and his umm seems to fixate
    on Arial</em>\r\nIn my time it was Gill Sans that I (initially and partly) fixated
    my <em>AlQuds</em> font on. This included the thick and thin strokes typical of
    Latin fonts. Recently I redesigned the font and made it monoline, and created
    a Latin that can go with it (see example above). Vertical spacing is indeed important
    in matching the two fonts, as Hrant found for Armenian. Making the x-height the
    same as typical Arabic shapes made the Latin look too small, so I made it larger.
    In my inexperience I drew the Latin outlines rather hastily, but I was satisfied
    as long as the Latin did not intrude on the Arabic, which was the main thing.
    However first Karsten Lueke (k.l.) and then Claudio Piccinini (piccic) could not
    accept such a crude Latin and kindly volunteered to refine the outlines and spacing.
    The very subtle changes in thickness keep the monoline and other features that
    matched my Arabic, yet the Latin now looks elegant, assured...and <em>Latin</em>.
    I am grateful for the skill and integrity of these two amazing designers, with
    flowers. I will post examples when I detail all the changes that this font went
    through since around 1962!\r\n\r\nOne thing that makes traditional Arabic look
    'Arabic' is the way the slant of the nib create thick and thin lines. The  nibs
    for both Latin and Arabic scripts both leaned to top right as the waw and the
    e in the diagram below show. Actually in Arabic the stroke is less inclined to
    the vertical, resulting in a thicker horizontal and a thinner vertical line, but
    this is only for the sake of demonstration. As scripts and then fonts evolved
    people accepted these variations in thickness as part of the written language.
    In slavish imitation of Latin typography, however,  many recent Arabic fonts seem
    as if they were a mirror-image of the Latin shapes, drawn with a reversed nib,
    for example a Latinized waw (in the center).  This helps give the incongruous
    look to these fonts that Hrant so hilariously described.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arabic-Latin-stroke_5736.jpg]"

    (or Japanese) typefaces have nothing to do with the style of the main typeface
    (Arabic or Japanese).\r\nWhile it's absurd an Arabic should conform to an ugly
    Latin alphabet for some reasons of \"default choice\", the opposite is also true.
    Each one of your Arabic alphabets look quite nice, professionally drawn, I mean.

    and if I were, I don't see how a Roman design -any design- could maintain its
    optimum line spacing AND proportionality with Arabic, AND keeping a level of 'standard
    look'. Forcing a design to be optimized for a line spacing (rather than the other
    way around) is the same thing as forcing Arabic for Roman optimized line spacing.
    An excess of line spacing for Roman is of a lesser sacrifice seems to me, particularly
    for a font that doesn't intend to be of Roman denomination.\r\n\r\nBut I'll collect
    as many Roman font as I can and I'll compare their look beside the Arabic part
    of Zar to see. 'Mellel' word processor for the Mac has a wonderful feature that
    you can select one font for one script and another font for another script, and
    adjust their size separately, within a single mixed text. This gives you a visual
    indication that for a similar magnification of Roman part, how much excess of
    line spacing is produced. Until now, all Roman fonts that I had, produced excessive
    line spacing, or they had a design completely incompatible with the Arabic side."
