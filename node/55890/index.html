  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is a request for help or advise in designing a masthead and/or layout for a newsletter. It will be circulate to the staff at an overnight shelter for adults who are homeless. I will lay out the goals and values, and what I have so far.</p>
<p>Thank you to any who assist with this.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was recently hired to supervise the staff at an overnight shelter for adults who are homeless. The shelter has been in existence for many years, but under different management. Our agency took over management of the shelter at the request of the agency that had been running it. We have hired all new staff and began three weeks ago.</p>
<p>GOALS
Training/developing the staff is one of my primary responsibilities. Part of that includes writing an internal newsletter. The goals of the newsletter are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Develop overall teamwork and unity. We have a staff of 25 people. Three weeks ago, none of these people had ever met. None of them had ever worked in this shelter before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop teamwork/unity across shift and gender dividers. We have a men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s side to the shelter. However, other than brief interactions, the men and women working in the shelter do not work together. It will be a constant struggle to not allow the staff to develop into two separate staffs — a women&rsquo;s staff and a men&rsquo;s staff.
Additionally, the evening and graveyard shift have only a 30 minute overlap, and have very different responsibilities. The weekday and weekend shifts do not meet at all. Because of budget limitations, it is doubtful we will get them together other than brief periods during training events. Once we are past the first couple of months, it is likely that we will never again have everybody together in one room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a spirit of professional service. Most of our staff are not used to thinking of themselves as &ldquo;professionals.&rdquo; I want them to realize, and remember they now are social-services professionals. This affects their attitude towards their work, their guests, and each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide training through a series of articles we can read and discuss. My time is flexible, so I intend to focus on the transition times when two shifts will be together. We can talk then, and I can follow that up with individual training with people during the course of their shift. The newsletter will let me address issues such as: How to keep guest from playing staff against each other, how to recognize drug usage, how to de-escalate a hostile situation, identifying and working with various mental disorders, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep staff members informed about what is happening in the shelter, as well as what is happening in the rest of the agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help people connect in relationships with other staff members and enjoy working together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NAME
Tacoma Avenue Shelter
TAS</p>
<p>VALUES
The Agency Core Values are:
Compassion
Diversity
Excellence
Justice
Stewardship</p>
<p>Mission and Vision Statement excerpts:
loving and compassionate service
dignity of the human person
serve and support poor and vulnerable people
provision of quality, integrated services and housing</p>
<p>And, we are serious about these values and mission statements. They are real, and being lived out by our staff.</p>
<p>We have housed over 140 men and 40 women on any given night. We aim to provide a safe and relaxing place where everyone is welcome, and anyone can get a good nights sleep. However we do not want to simply be a place to sleep. We are also working to identify those who want to change their situation, and help them connect with the other community resources to reach their goals.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE
I will be working in Adobe InDesign CS2. This is my own personal software. The rest of the agency uses Word. As a Wordperfect/InDesign user, I installed OpenOffice on my own computer to be compatible. But the newsletter is my design, and will be done entirely in InDesign CS2.</p>
<p>I have a limited selection of typefaces, and am planning on a combo of Adobe Caslon Pro (10.5/13 or 11/13), and Cronos Pro. I recently reversed my usual selection, and used the Cronos as the body text, and Caslon for titles, and the response was favorable, especially with younger individuals in the same age span as most of the intended recipients for this newsletter. The response from people was also consistent with the feel I wanted to develop. I want it to be professional, yet friendly and informal, with an attitude of excellent service to others. I also want something that is not trendy. Unfortunately, my feel for typefaces is not well developed at this time.</p>
<p>I have also used Zapf Chancery Med Italic for drop caps etc. I picked Caslon and Cronos because I have used them together before, and people responded to the selection. When I laid out a couple of documents in different typefaces, most people picked the sample with these two. I don&rsquo;t use bootleg typefaces. Additionally, the variety of weights in these two typefaces allows me to find a weight that will reproduce well on a copier.</p>
<p>However I am open to suggestions based on typefaces that I have (standard sets included with InDesign CS2, WordPerfect and a few exceptions. But no bootleg typefaces.)</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE
I started years ago with Pagemaker, after I found brand new copy at a local thrift store. I upgraded from Pagemaker to CS2 and love it. I also pastor a small church, which combined with the long hours I am putting in to get the shelter started, means I have little time to experiment with different designs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, experimentation is the only way I can develop something. It usually takes me a year, and many iterations before I reach a design I like, and that works. I have reached the point where I can do this faster for text layout etc, but am new to masthead design, and have only done a couple of newsletter layouts. Most of my work has been in developing teaching/training materials in the church, where we use smaller formats that will fit into a book or program.</p>
<p>I started by using the name and initials of the shelter in various combinations. I then played with them, looking at other logos and mastheads and trying to copy different techniques. Unfortunately I have had only a little time, and haven&rsquo;t found anything that looked good.</p>
<p>AUDIENCE
Most of the staff are 22-35, with another group in their 40s. Half are men, half are women. Education ranges from one or two years of college to Bachelors degrees. For the most part, they are not used to thinking of themselves as professionals. They are caring people who want to make a difference in the world by serving others. They need training and direction, but are excited about the changes they have already made at the shelter, and are beginning to see just how much they can do as a team.</p>
<p>CONTENT (not in order of significance or frequency)
News articles or updates on what is happening at the shelter.
News articles or updates on what is happening in the rest of the agency.
Training articles.
Possibly a classified section for staff members to post notices.
New policy articles — We are developing some policies as we go.
Ideas and questions for staff to discuss amongst themselves and then make recommendations.
Descriptions or stories about different staff members.
Descriptions of upcoming workshops or other training opportunities.</p>
<p>FORMAT
I am looking at a 8.5x11 format and considering an 11x17 format folded with a letter-sized page in the middle. Page count will vary between 2-6. The letter-sized format will be used when there are fewer pages. The tabloid-sized layout will be used when there are more pages. At this point I am still feeling my way along for how many pages we will consistently have.</p>
<p>It will be black and white only, and needs to be clear and legible when output ranges from 300 to 1200 dpi lasers. It also needs to remain clean and legible when printed out on a copier. And, it should look good in a pdf that is emailed.</p>
<p>There will be occasional diagrams, charts and illustrations.</p>
<p>I have used and like grids that give me the flexibility to vary column numbers and width to fit the contents, and use pull quotes or sidebars. I am looking for something that is consistent, but flexible.</p>
<p>Between the long hours of getting the shelter up and running, and also pastoring a small church, I am afraid I do not have the flexibility to spend a couple of weeks playing with different designs until I find something that works. And unfortunately, at my present skill level, that&rsquo;s what it takes me — a <em>lot</em> of time. I eventually recognize what works, but take forever to come up with it on my own.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions, design ideas or even completed designs for masthead or newsletter layout.</p>
<p>And, the guests we serve will appreciate the improved service that comes from a well trained and unified staff.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Chuck Taylor</p>

<p>why not hire a graphic designer to do it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because non-profit funding is rapidly disappearing.</p>
<p>Also, the previous management let things run down, and we started out having to buy all new mattresses, sheets, blankets (plus donations), repair the building, hire staff before shelter-specific funding was available&hellip;</p>
<p>Before we came, the old mattresses had holes where springs protruded, there weren&rsquo;t any sheets on the men&rsquo;s side (and only one sheet per guest on the women&rsquo;s side), and only a few blankets.</p>
<p>We do not have access to the donor list for the previous shelter, so we have to raise all new donors. About the only pieces of equipment we inherited are a bunch of metal-frame bunks and mattresses we promptly threw out. We need(ed) computers, surveillance cameras, TVs, microwaves, soap dispensers, repaired showers, toilet paper dispensers, mops, brooms, first aid kits, desks, chairs, tables, shower mats, telephones, filing cabinets, locks, lockers for guests, lighting, towels, washcloths, hand sanitizer dispensers, copy machine, printers&hellip;</p>
<p>At this point, a professionally-designed newsletter for in-house use is not high on the priority list for funding.</p>
<p>:-(</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Chuck</p>

You, however, are looking for something much more substantial, and have backed it up with a good brief.
That is why I recommended subcontracting the work.</div>
