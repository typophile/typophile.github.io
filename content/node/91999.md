  font, 'Edwardian' or Edwardian Script) \r\nIt must be...\r\nLegible on HD res screen
  for relatively quick reading\r\nHint at Elegance and Romance without being overtly
  so \r\nIt could be either...\r\nA font from that era \r\nor...\r\nA contemporary
  interpretation derived from signage or calligraphy of the era.\r\nAny advice would
  be gratefully received,\r\nThanks\r\nAlex"

    Medical College in London,\u201D but it certainly wasn\u2019t inspired by Edwardian
    letterforms. It's certainly whimsical, but it falls into illegibility pretty quickly
    at smaller sizes\u2026IMHO."
