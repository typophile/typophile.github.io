  body: "OT does one-to-many (type 2 GSUB lookup) easily enough. In theory, it can
    be made to do many-to-many, but in fact this is nowhere supported in either tools
    or apps. So you'd probably have to do some clever contextual one-to-many substitutions.
    In other words, you would have to analyse the decimal positions in the number,
    and substitute the appropriate word for the letters in each position. So, for
    an English example you might have a number '625', and you would need context to
    isolate the initial numeral and capture that it is in the hundreds position (followed
    by two integers), then substitute\r\n\r\n<code>six -> s i x space h u n d r e
    d space a n d</code>\r\n\r\nthen you would capture the 2 in the tens position:\r\n\r\n<code>two
    -> t w e n t y hyphen</code>\r\n\r\nand finally the five in the ones position:\r\n\r\n<code>five
    -> f i v e</code>\r\n\r\nThe biggest risk in this kind of approach is failure
    of context, which means you need to carefully think through all the permutations
    of situations in which a number might occur. I think the feature would need to
    be like the 'frac' feature, i.e. explicitly applied by a user to a selected string
    of characters, and not the sort of feature one could safely turn on for an entire
    document."

    \"seventy-zero,\" and I'd bet in Danish, it's not \"zero and seventy.\"\r\n\r\nThat
    aside, with some work, you could probably get the font to do the job, even in
    Danish. But if you're working on a document, it might be better to do search &
    replaces. If you do the work in the font, what's in the underlying document (say,
    the XML exported from an InDesign file...)?"

  body: BTW, I think this is a really bad idea. 'Six hundred twenty five' is not a
    glyph variant of the character string '625', it is a different character string,
    a different convention for recording a number in writing.

  body: "Reordering glyphs using GSUB is a bit tricky. I do it sometimes in order
    to be able to ligate reordered characters in Indic fonts, but I'm never entirely
    comfortable doing so. You have to do it in two steps: contextually insert the
    new glyph where you want it, and then contextually delete the old glyph from the
    unwanted location. Since there are no insert/delete GSUB lookup types per se,
    what you need to do is first use a one-to-many lookup, and then a many-to-one
    lookups. So, for example, let's say I want to reorder the glyphs in the sequence
    ABC so that they are BAC, I would first have a lookup (VOLT syntax; sorry the
    Adobe stuff makes no sense to me).\r\n\r\n<code>A -> B A\r\n|C</code>\r\n\r\nwhich
    would result in BABC; then a second lookup something like\r\n\r\n<code>A B ->
    A\r\nB|</code>\r\n\r\nresulting in BAC.\r\n"
