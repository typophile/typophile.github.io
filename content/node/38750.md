  a custom restaurant sign based\r\non an old municipal document, perhaps as much
  as 200\r\nyears old. I wouldn\u2019t think there exists a font today\r\nto match
  exactly, but is there any similar font that \r\nI might use for the restaurant\u2019s
  website?\r\n\r\nI note the serifs on the lowercase l, v, a, and d,\r\nand the top
  serif on the uppercase C.\r\n\r\nhttp://clevelanderbar.googlepages.com/Clevelander1.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nredstart"

    to be based on? In other words, I wonder how much it has been altered. To me it's
    not obvious that this is lettering of that vintage, since I would have expected
    a Caslon or other classic serif style to be in use in the post-Revolutionary era.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "The terminals of the letters resemble hand-drawn lettering with a pen more
    than metal type, which would have flatter baseline serifs. Even though it is more
    modern, Morris Benton's 'Motto' has somewhat similar terminals, though the weight
    is heavier. Paul Lloyd has done a version which he calls <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script04Pg16.html\">'Queen
    Empress'</a>. It's about midway down the page. This font is a free download at
    TypOasis.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "You're welcome. This one has been bugging me, but I have not found an old
    font that is very similar. The strange flaring of the a and d reminded me of <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/alphabet/\">Alphabet</a> by Gabor Kothay.
    Since it's a Sans adding the serifs to the terminals would be pretty easy and
    you might produce something sort of close to the sign lettering. I have the font
    and am tempted to try it, just to see if it's anywhere close.(Sometimes these
    ideas of mine go very far off the mark.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Never mind. I tried it, and first of all, my skills are pitiful when it comes
    to font modifications. Someone who knows what they are doing might have made something
    that looked presentable, but that wasn't what I got. You'd probably be better
    of starting with a serif font, and modifying the serifs to look more like these.
    Adding them to a sans font was too much for me.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
