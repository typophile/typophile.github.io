body: "TypeTogether is happy to release this gorgeous font family, designed by Pilar
  Cano. It is a gentle typeface, humanistic in concept yet with a contemporary feel,
  where softness and fluidity play a very important role. Originally intended for
  art, design and architecture books, Edita can graciously work alongside photographs
  and images alike, producing an amazing synergy. Furthermore, Edita is a legibility
  workhorse, whether it is used in a few paragraphs or in a 600-page novel.\r\n\r\nAvailable
  exclusively in our online store More info [[http://www.type-together.com/Edita|here]].[img:sites/default/files/old-images/edita_4596.gif]"

  body: "Dear forum of experts on typography.\r\nI find this design very intriguing.
    It seems to me like a fresh typeface with a slight \u201Csoft roughness\u201D
    to it, but subtle enough for it not to stand out too much in longer text, but
    to present a body copy in an modestly elegant way. (No, I try not to promote it,
    I try just to describe my associations.)\r\nBUT: I am by no means an expert, rather
    I merely appreciate good design. So I can\u2019t really estimate how others would
    perceive it, an anonymous \u2018uninformed recipient\u2019. I would like to make
    us of this font in a bit more conservative environment than the indicated \u201C
    art, design and architecture\u201D field. Although definitely not as conservative
    as legal or banking. My concern is, would this face \u201Cstand out\u201D too
    much by itself as a \u201Ctoo different than normal\u201D typeface and therefore
    distract the reader? Would it appear as unexpected? \r\n\r\nI hope somebody can
    give me some estimation. Thank you very much. "
