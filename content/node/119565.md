body: "Today I designed a dingbat font with multiple layers and for some reason when
  the different fonts are stacked there's a vertical shift with each layer. In other
  words, the shapes are not vertically centered even though they do align perfectly
  in FontLab. Is there something I might be doing wrong?\r\n\r\nAlso, how do you define
  the vertical metrics in dingbat fonts?"
