  love to have same feature set in InDesign and Illustrator. I\u2019d love to have
  the ease of use of Stylistic Sets, Character Variants, OT Dropcaps, Historical Forms,
  Historical Ligatures, OT Unicase and Nut Fractions. I\u2019ve made this rather raw
  and quick mockup and I want to share it with you, fellow typophiles. I\u2019m not
  affiliated with Adobe, these are just my thoughts on how to UI could work.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  you have some other ideas? Firefox Nightly and some other browsers for example,
  supports almost all OT features by font-feature-settings: \"xxxx\";. So this support
  could be done. Maybe it\u2019s possible to convince other software developers to
  support more OT features? "

    was that for years, when InDesign was the upstart application challenging Quark
    Xpress, and with an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at getting users to switch,
    they mentioned many reasons, but not once OpenType support, despite the fact that
    Quark did not support OT features, whereas InD did. At that point I decided that
    one should be greatful for small mercies, and the fact that MicroSoft and Adobe
    had managed to make this awesome functionality a practical reality. Sure, it could
    be better supported, and perhaps one day it will be."

  body: "Not all of these applications are equal. The \"Crisp\" setting in that Character
    panel only has use for text in Photoshop -- and then only when the text gets rasterized.\r\n\r\nBut
    yes: it <em>would</em> have been nice if all of Adobe's inter-application teams
    decided on some common panels, instead of treating themselves as islands, convinced
    of having The Definite Answer all on their own.\r\n\r\nAs for plug-ins: sure.
    There are two options. Design new panels that only have the options available
    to all three main programs (.. perhaps 4, I'm not sure about FrameMaker's OT caps),
    or add the missing feature sets to the software that doesn't have it. That latter
    option needs not only a new interface but also a new document format, which may
    make it incompatible with previous versions."

    with now, I think. Paragraph Styles are definately the way to work for normal
    documents, but for short bursts of text, flyers and display typography with swashes
    and alternates a better interface would be awesome.\r\n\r\nAnd while we are at
    it: is there not a way to implement a glyphs panel in photoshop. This is a feature
    I use all the time in InD and Illu, and I miss it everytime I use PS..."
