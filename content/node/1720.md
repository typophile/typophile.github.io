  body: I think it&#39;s slightly manipulated. Made bolder and maybe fixed the kerning.

  body: Karen&#39;s is much, much closer, though there are very subtle differences
    &#40;note where the crossbars of the H and E meet the verticals&#41;.

  body: I&#39;m sorry Jack, but Karen&#39;s looks a lot closer IMHO. <BR>The dots
    in your sample look way too big from here,  <BR>and for example the R doesn&#39;t
    match.

    your post and thought you meant  <BR>your sample was a closer match. Sorry &#39;bout
    giving  <BR>the wrong impression. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
