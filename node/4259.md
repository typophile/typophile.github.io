  alt=\"13 Ghosts script font\"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to find something as close
  to it as possible. The production notes about the set only gave me the following
  clues: &#34;The Latin \u201Cetchings\u201D were actually rendered on a plastic overlay
  and adhered to the glass walls to achieve Hargreaves\u2019 \u201CArcanum\u201D design
  motif. &#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time.  <BR> <BR>Dar"

  body: Your conclusion looks right, but at <a href="http://www.abstractfonts.com/forum">Abstract
    Fonts Forum</a>, there was <a href="http://www.abstractfonts.com/forum/showthread.php?s=c91228377158c2fa6023e321dca50517&amp;threadid=916&amp;highlight=ghosts">a
    different conclusion</a> about this font. <BR> <BR>Norfok.com, which is referenced,
    doesn&#39;t seem to be working for me anymore -- but maybe it&#39;s due to my
    connection.  Either way, although I remember it as looking right, I can&#39;t
    check it out right now.  Of course, it&#39;s probably something simple; maybe
    Norfok&#39;s just releasing a reverse-slanted version.

  body: <a href="http://www.norfok.com/usa.htm" target="_blank"> Norfok</a> makes
    fonts based on movie logos. So its <a href="http://www.norfok.com/pre_otectpray.htm"
    target="_blank"> Otectpray</a> is a <BR>font made <i>after</i> the movie was released.
    <BR> <BR>Yves gave you what was surely the original font used. <BR>

  body: Though the lowercase clearly is a rip-off from Ex Ponto,  <BR>the caps and
    numerals are distinctly different &#40;and not  <BR>very well designed&#41;. I&#39;ll
    add Octectpray to the ID.

  body: Norfok seems to be working now, but I&#39;m trying on a different connection.  Now
    that it comes up, I see the explanation -- thank you. <BR> <BR>&#40;And I never
    doubted Yves; I&#39;ve been lurking long enough to see the magic he works.&#41;  <IMG

    <BR> <BR>Please, don&#39;t bother adding Octetpray if it was made after &#40;and
    based on&#41; the movie, as it seems to be; it&#39;d be incorrect and misleading.  Rather,
    I&#39;ll respond to the AbstractFonts conversation and link to this thread.
