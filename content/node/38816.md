    obvisouly don't live in San Francisco. :)\r\n\r\nThe release of the Google OS
    (not a Google phone or gPhone, which I doubt exists) isn't about the need to for
    smart phones over PCs, rather a reaction to a <strong>very large</strong> demand
    for open source technologies, and to accommodate for everyone's growing needs
    in mobility. The release of their OS is probably going to open some major doors
    for a wide range of users (not just tech heads, businessmen or tweens) and may
    ultimately help thrust the US into the forefront of mobile technologies (yes,
    it is lacking here).\r\n\r\nI disagree that the necessity for a \"smart phone\"
    doesn't exist. Most people think of Windows Mobile or Palm when speaking of \"smart
    phones\" and in my opinion, these is where the problem lies -- these are both
    pretty awful experiences and inappropriate for much of the market. The sheer amount
    of media attention that the mobile industry is receiving right now, tells me that
    people are ready to move forward and integrate more complex devices (not difficult
    or over-saturated with features) into their lifestyles.\r\n"

    simply released open source software today, it''s an OS for cell phones. (google
    advertising can hook into it, of course) '

    of the Cartels that control the data, then start developing open source software/hardware. "
