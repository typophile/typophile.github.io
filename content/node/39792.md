  Every day i'll add a new one. Perhaps someone is interested in regarding ...\r\nhttp://www.slanted.de/node/1561\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_3941.12.jpg]"

    you travel? Louise Fili shared some in her book(let) <a href="http://louisefili.com/books/b3.html">A
    Designer''s Guide to Italy</a>. '

  body: "Thanks Tiffany. I have a lot of them, but i stopped collecting because of
    not knowing where to store more big boxes with a lot of sheet of papers in it
    ;-) and I'm really no \"good\" collector \u2013 because i hate to press these
    papers. In my opinion they loose their souls. I love to touch the papers and to
    hear the rustling sound of the paper. But i collected them at stores around the
    corner while buying fruits. Sometimes i can't resist ... Here in Germany there
    is one really professional collector. His name is Dirik von Oetttingen and his
    collection is about 40.000 papers. There are a lot of very fine and very old papers,
    while mine are really common. He published a fine book now, where you can stare
    at old sicilian ornaments, and more ... it's written in german, but even if you
    aren't able to read german it's worth regarding. (http://www.amazon.de/Verh\xFCllt-verf\xFChren-Die-Welt-Orange/dp/3930752476/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196890004&sr=8-1)"

  body: "Yeah, that would be a great book, Patty.\r\n\r\nNora, that book is all about
    his collection? Too bad amazon.com doesn't have it. It would be an interesting
    book to view.\r\n\r\nI think ephemeral collecting might begin as \"common\" things,
    but it is the story and the reason behind the collecting that makes them uncommon.
    Your collection will, one day, tell a story to others who didn't share the same
    store as you. (For instance)"

    verlag\u201D in Potsdam. The owner ist Betina M\xFCller. She also teaches typography
    and did the artwork for this book. You can ask her if there is a possibility to

    written in english but in german language. After correcting the post above, it
    has changed his place ...

    Nice collection!
