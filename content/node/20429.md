  body: Jess, I'll have to disagree with you. I think people rely too much on FontLab's
    default options and algorithms that fill-in the settings that were not provided
    by the font developer. In fact, I think FL should have a 'Release mode' that would
    warn everything that didn't comply with the standards/specifications, or was considered
    'suspect'. That would be the only way to make a close-to-rock-solid font file.

    on pg 303 I feel a little more confident to change those numbers. It's a fear
    of messing things up, "don't touch anything or this thing could come crashing
    down!" hehe

    not with the font VFB but as independent registry file. I have several of these,
    used for different kinds of font generation, and import the one I need before
    generating a font.

  body: "Sorry, to pick an old topic here, but I want to \u201Cget down\u201D and
    learn all this \u2014 for real now.\r\n\r\nThese are my impression after reading
    different articles and asking people:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Regarding the vertical metrics:\r\nKnowledge
    that has to do with the TypoAscender/Descender/hhea.Ascender/Descender/OS/2.winAscender/Descender
    etc, is not really any \u201Cfinal bank\u201D of knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhy? As an
    example, I read the \"vertical metrics how-to\" and it seems that a little bit
    of that and a little bit of this, actually works. And if not set optimal \u2013
    it doesn\u2019t mean that the font will be corrupt or will not work, am I right?
    The how-to article is updated a lot of times, changing it\u2019s mind so to speak
    :)\r\n\r\nIs it that these things are more of a very advanced expert discussion
    going on, similar to which sparkling water has the most optimal bubbles :)\r\n\r\nQUESTION:\r\n\r\nWill,
    or will not, an OpenType font work fine (for standard users \u2013 not extreme
    typohpiles) in both Windows and OSX even though these OS/2/hhea/win values do
    not exactly match? Maybe it\u2019s OK if it differs a little bit from plattform
    to plattform in the total height when used, since the designer for sure anyway
    will set his optimal values.\r\n\r\nBut will it work? What could actually happen
    if these settings are not \"optimal\"? Will the font be unstabile? What problems
    will the user have?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that I think it's rather strange
    that the leading program FontLab\u2019s recommended settings (Calculate Values
    Automatically) actually _creates_ a problem like this, and also that it doesn\u2019t
    seem as if there is a straight answer anywhere to be found.\r\n\r\nFinally \u2013
    take the font Zapfino with it\u2019s long swashes going way above the ascender
    \u2013 if I understand correctly: The Bbox size in this font, is WAY to small
    for the glyphs. So Zapfino is in other words not an optimal font?\r\n\r\nOR\u2026
    are these values \u201Cjust numbers\u201D that have to be set correctly \u2014
    and then we don\u2019t think more about it? :)\r\n\r\n(Phew\u2026)\r\n\r\nPS.
    Sorry for a long post, but I\u2019m having problems understanding all this, especially
    the more I read.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>But will it work? What could actually happen if these settings are not
    \u201Coptimal\u201D? Will the font be unstabile? What problems will the user have?</em>\r\n\r\nLets
    say I have a carefully formatted Word document (or an Excel spreadsheet, or a
    Powerpoint presentation...) that I have created on Windows and which uses default
    linespacing as determined by the font metrics. I send it to a colleague who will
    add a couple of graphics in the spaces I have left for him to do so, and then
    print the document for distribution. He receives the file, opens it in Word on
    the Mac, and because the font has incompatible OS/2 and hhea table metrics, the
    linespacing is completely different from my original. All the formatting is messed
    up. The spaces for the graphics are no longer the correct size. The page breaks
    are in the wrong places, etc.\r\n\r\nNow a smart user will control the formatting
    in such a way that it will not be screwed up by an incompatibility in font metrics,
    but as you specified, we're talking about 'standard users'.\r\n\r\nThat's the
    compatibility issue.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is clipping. If the OS/2 Win values
    are too small, any part of a glyph that extends beyond those values will be clipped
    in many apps and on some printers.\r\n\r\n<em>Finally \u2013 take the font Zapfino
    with it\u2019s long swashes going way above the ascender \u2013 if I understand
    correctly: The Bbox size in this font, is WAY to small for the glyphs. So Zapfino
    is in other words not an optimal font?</em>\r\n\r\nThe Apple version of Zapfino
    is an unusual font in a number of ways, but those long extenders actually do fit
    within the vertical metrics. I can't remember the exact values, and Apple fiddled
    with the font after delivery (setting a low upm value to increase the relative
    size of the font)."

  body: "As to possibly different line distances in different applications, or squashing,
    or clipping of glyphs -- sometimes it's not possible to avoid all of them. E.g.,
    if your font has <cite>a few</cite> glyphs with very large ascenders, then you
    may accept that these get squashed or clipped in some applications, to make sure
    that default line distance will not be too much. In some way, it is you who has
    to set priorities. (In some applications, clipping behavior even seems to differs
    depending if the font is PS-OTF or TT-OTF ...)\r\n\r\n<cite>not really any \u201Cfinal
    bank\u201D of knowledge</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is true for vertical metrics, but also
    for font family naming and a couple of other issues. There are too many factors
    involved, like, will you make PS-OTFs or TT-OTFs, will your family follow Microsoft's
    example and have exactly four styles, or will it have more styles (or less, which
    can turn out to be as problematic), or do you want to use your PS-OTFs down to
    OS9 (even more restrictions)? Unfortunately, this contradicts the compatibility
    claim made for the OpenType font format.\r\nThat OpenType is still 'under development'
    (see the Vertical Metrics How-to: 'Update to the update' near the bottom) doesn't
    make things easier too. Be prepared to make updates regularly.\r\nNever expect
    definitive answers, or a \"final bank of knowledge\". They don't exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\nKarsten"
