  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#39;m really touched how much everyone liked typecon. It is truly amazing how this conference and organization has grown. For those of you who weren&#39;t at the first 2, &#40;I don&#39;t think anyone here except maybe Kent has,&#41; you wouldn&#39;t believe it. It used to be about 30 people gathered in a room talking about type, and then going out for Chinese food at a groovy Polynesian resturant.  <BR> <BR>Since this is my first foray into Typophile, I&#39;d like to say hello to everyone! I think that these forums are an excellent way to increase awarness and spread the good word about type. Again, I&#39;d like to add my 2 cents about how good TypeCon 2003 was. My head&#39;s still spinning! <BR> <BR>Hello to all, and especially to Hrant, who doesn&#39;t deserve all the negative attention he receives.</div>

This conference is like crack for me and I cannot get enough of it! <BR> <BR>It was such a delight to see so many of you in my hometown and I&#39;m very much looking forward to seeing you all in SF if not sooner! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

Yeah, I was only at the first one, but I&#39;m glad <BR>to hear that the increase in numbers has apparently left TypeCon&#39;s great spirit intact. <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s better these days. We beat most of the hordes back into their caves. The ones still in the open tend to stay quiet - like they always have when it comes to actually sharing knowledge of type! Darn shame, that part. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This morning, while making my bed, I was thinking about the impossibility of even attempting to point out highlights for TypeCon. I did mention two above, but realized this morning, while showering, that those weren&#39;t the only highlights, and maybe not even the top two for the whole of the last few days. Maybe the top two if we are just thinking in terms on the presentations, but even still ... Every presentation that I attended left me with more questions and thoughts and inspiration.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been visually emotionally physically intellectually and even spiritually &#40;on some level&#41; saturated. I&#39;m sitting here trying to organize my day realizing that I can&#39;t because I&#39;m already going through withdrawals.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">as i arise from my time zone alteration stupor [those overnight trans-atlantic flights really suck], i am living up to my typecon 03 promises: i&#39;m finally posting a non-st bride alert email. . . . <BR> <BR>i must agree with everyone&#39;s rave reviews about the conference this year - it was a truly wonderful few days. it&#39;s great to see typography escaping the stuffy academic approach and moving towards a truly accessible environment. [it was also a new experience to be surrounded by people my own age - and younger!] <BR> <BR>my only complaint, if one could even call it that, is that both the type blog panel and the education panel had better plan longer time slots for next year - we were just starting to get into the good stuff when the time was up. <BR> <BR>so yes, dyana has some serious swing in her hips, keith has a way with napkins, and stephen is the man for all hours card games. <BR> <BR>[hopefully] see you all next year, i&#39;m going back to bed.</div>

Things were really quaint the second year, not much different from the first &#40;from what I understand&#41;. Things really took a leap forward when you took it on, Tony, and moved things to Rochester. And it just keeps getting better and better.

I bought the Design Celebration book as well, which contains ample showings of all the entrants&#39; proposals. There&#39;s a website for that somewhere as well; I&#39;ll try to dig around for it. <BR> <BR>I left that place with so much swag, I ended up mailing my laundry to myself.</div>
