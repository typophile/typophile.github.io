  body: "Thought it was easy as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic|Trade
    Gothic Condensed Bold]] for \"VANDAL GOTHIC\" but I was forgetting this /J. The
    only I have in stock that could fit these specifications is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic|Rama
    Gothic Expanded]] (Semibold or Bold). There are also:\r\n- [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-be|Akzidenz
    Grotesk Condensed]] but it's not enough bold and following weights (Medium and
    Bold) have totally different /K, /P and /J designs\r\n- [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr|Block
    Gothic]] but /K is off\r\n- [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica|Helevetica
    Condensed Bold]] close but overall design off"
