<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Something new has happened here at Typophile. We've added a new membership section and it is only for the girls! Several of you heard about it at TypeCon, and tonight Jared made it so. Before we open up the floodgates, so to speak, I wanted to hear from the girls. What do you think it can become? What do you want it to be? Should it be exclusively X chromosome? I've already got a t-shirt contest in mind. We are discussing different possibilities for membership, so let me know what you think it is worth. <br></div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Then I must suggest the "Alpha-males," to counter this blatant sexism. <br> <br>(Though I'm not sure I'd want to be a member. Can I be a "Betty?" You can dress me in oversized lady's clothes and bring me to tea parties!)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Haha! Good reply Paul. One of the main reasons behind forming this "club", is to get more girls/woman to participate. As much as I love the odds, I'd much rather share with other girls. Take TypeCon for instance, I heard someone mention that this year had more girls than ever participating. I think that is wonderful. The idea of being an Alphabetty is simply to show our presence, as a group, in the the bigger group of typographers, type designers, visual communicators and artists. Anyone can tell you that I'm one of the least sexist people on the planet. (long pause) I suppose the way I objectify Jude Law isn't healthy though. ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>No, objectifying men is good! This may be a little off-topic, but I always felt that if we want to even things out, either we need to 1) stop objectifying women or 2) objectify men more. And hey, some women like being objectified, so why deny them that right? Ergo, I pick 2). <br> <br>So what are your ideas for the T-shirt contest?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey there, Dyana! <br> <br>Yeah. Depending on my mood, unfortunately, dictates how I feel about the whole to objectify or not to objectify topic. <br> <br>I have something specific in mind, very middle third of the last century (haha). But I'm thinking we'll open the gates (soon) and let others post their ideas. I'm not so sure I'll open the voting up to the guys (sorry). But, as soon as we nail that down I'll let you know. So for now, maybe just start sketching.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was talking to a fellow female type designer today and she mentioned a movement awhile back that didn't seem to catch on, perhaps for being too cutesy/campy. <br> <br>We are just concerned with women's issues, that's all (women's type & lettering issues, that is) not about completely distancing ourselves. <br> <br>P.S.

<div class=commentbody>I am so into this I don't even know from X chromosome! Must be why I was wearing red and black. (Although that lilac shirt came in handy when I became a sloppy wine drunk on Friday night.) <br> <br>Here's the deal, for me. We chicas need and want to develop a separate space because we are currently in the minority. I'm hoping that changes someday and this is one way to make that happen. <br> <br>There are a tremendous amount of supportive and encouraging men in this field, but there's still that speed bump women need to climb over when confronted with a room full of one type of human being, which in this case is predominantly white, hetero men. <br> <br>I don't think we need to be either exclusive or private -- just focused on women. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>first and foremost - i don't see here a lot of girls</i> <br> <br>I think this is precisely why "to do it exclusive." I doubt the percentage of women posting in these forums accurately represents the number of women interested in the topics and lurking. By and large, women have their own conversational style [see the studies of <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dbooks%26field-keywords%3DDeborah%20Tannen%26url%3Dindex%3Dbooks%26store-name%3Dbooks/102-5443600-8270563 target=_blank>Deborah Tannen</a>, et al.] and I think many of the threads here quickly diverge from an environment where they care to participate. <br> <br>I don't have a problem with exclusivity -- you go, girls! I do hope, however, that from time to time you'll return to join the rest of us floundering plebes and share your wisdom. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I love what I'm hearing from Tiffany, Dyana, Kristin, and Kent! There are some very important women's issues in typography and design, and there absolutely must be a forum in which women can freely discuss them. <br> <br>I don't see this as being about divisiveness at all; rather, it's about women communicating with and assisting other women. And I think that, for this to work best, the Alphabetties forum has to provide for exchange among registered women users only. Whether men can lurk should, in my opinion, be entirely up to the Alphabetties. <br> <br>We're not going to lose Tiffany, Kristin, and Dyana; but there will be occasional moments when they will step out amongst themselves to chat. And when they do, let's not cry "foul," but rather say instead, "good for them!" <br> <br>Jon <br> <br>P.S.

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, killer idea. Minorities naturally need to bind together more. Majorities simply need to understand that, and not use it as a license to amplify their own exclusivity. Just make sure you don't get too cute or pink. Don't try to be "as good as the boys, but different" - be <i>girls</i> - leverage that to the max. <br> <br>BTW, if we ever have a Male-only type club, we should be called Finials. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
