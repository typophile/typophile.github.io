    just for me? >^P All cleaned up this will be very beautiful. keep up the good
    work!\r\n\r\np.s. there's quite a bit of [[oldrich menhart|menhart]] in there,
    isn't there?"

  body: "Thanks Paul. Yes, there's quite a bit of some old Menhart typeface which
    name I don't even know, It was the starting point. But I'm trying to move as far
    from it as possible. \r\n\r\nI'm going to keep some roughness in the outlines,
    or at least \"warmth\", but for now they are best described as \"jagged\".\r\n\r\nBTW
    do you have any hints how to most easily make different kinds of roughness? Or
    is the only way to painstakingly go trough every character and adjust everything
    by hand?"

    think it really depends on the kind of effect you're aiming for. sometimes when
    i want to roughen things up, i take my outlines into illustrator and play around
    with the \"roughen\" and then \"smooth\" and keep looping until i get the kind
    of effect i want. but then you have to clean things up again in FontLab, so this
    might only be marginally faster than adjusting everything by hand. >^P Or, if
    you're a [[python]] scripting whiz, i'm sure you could write a script that'd do
    it all for you."

  body: "Hi Jan\r\n\r\nThe typeface you have used is called Parlament. \r\n\r\nParlament
    is a very interesting typeface, including the S and s which you have replaced.
    Why not simply digitize it as faithfully as you can, and call it a revival? Rather
    than starting with Parlament and then moving \"as far from it as possible\", either
    acknowledge the design's strengths, finish the design as a revival, or don't start
    with an existing typeface at all. Digitizing an existing typeface that has not
    been available for years (and I think Parlament was made exclusively for the Czech
    government) is a good thing, made all the better when you acknowledge your source
    material and do what you can to make the results useful. Is there an Italic? Even
    if you are a skilled calligrapher, it would be nearly impossible to devise an
    italic to match all the quirks and character of the Roman. Menhart's work is always
    very personal, unique and calligraphic.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could do a display version
    based closely on the original, and a text version with the roughness and lowered
    contrast of this one. The text version could have a more conventional s shape,
    looser spacing, better proportions (g, a, R) and lining numerals. \r\n\r\nAt the
    very least, I suggest returning to the original s shapes and trying to edit them
    to be more conventional and less extreme. Your replacement s and S do not match
    the calligraphic style of the rest of the font, and the lowercase s is very wide.
    If your original specimen shows the cap S, then use that as a guide for both uppercase
    and lowercase. Your sample also omits the slope of the original."

  body: "Thanks, crossgrove. Many good points... but I have point out more strongly
    that this is no \"serious\" project, it will propably be forgotten in my desk
    drawer. So issues about the original design isn't that important at this moment.
    I just want to see where this goes to and credit Parlament (oh, that's the name)
    at least as \"inspiration\".\r\n\r\nI would also really like to see someone do
    a good revival of Parlament. I myself can't do it; I'm not skilled enough and
    I don't even have a decent sample, I interpreted these characters from a small
    jpeg. \r\n\r\nFor text, I found the 'a' and 's' to be the greatest weaknesses.
    I can see the problem with the 's', but don't want to back to the original shape
    that I found problematic in text. The s clearly needs a decent redraw so I'll
    work on it.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm adding some quirkiness to many of the letters.
    I'm curious to see where that leads.\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in creating an
    italic, I have already tried to create some characters but they seem a bit problematic,
    but there are some promise."
