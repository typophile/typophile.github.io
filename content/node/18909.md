body: "You are invited to explore the crossroads of spontaneity and traditional book
  art methods by participating in the second annual Summer Institute at the Wells
  Book Arts Center. Our classes in lettering arts, bookbinding, and letterpress printing
  are taught by the best artists, teachers, and craftspeople. Come for a week of intensive
  creating and learning in our beautiful lakeshore setting in the heart of New York's
  Finger Lakes.\r\n\r\nIn Session I, July 9-15, Peter Bain's course in typeface design
  will take participants from concept, to paper & pen, to pixel. The students of Shanna
  Leino will build a leather-bound book using late Coptic design and techniques, and
  Katherine McCanless Ruffin's students will learn to use hand-set type for letterpress
  printing. In Session II, July 16-22, Cheryl Jacobsen's class will focus on calligraphy
  as it relates to and enhances personal artistic expression. Students in the class
  of Wells' own Margot Ecke will make leatherbound girdle books, the kind that in
  times medieval hung from the owner's belt or girdle. Robin Price's class will create
  printed sheets through chance operations inspired by the processes that the Surrealists
  made famous. \r\n\r\nStudents choose one class of the three offered, and may take
  a class in each session. Classes are limited to 8-12 participants. In addition to
  daily classes, there will be slide presentations of instructors' work, 24-hour access
  to the studios, and an optional field trip to the Press & Letterfoundry of Michael
  & Winifred Bixler in Skaneateles.\r\n\r\nFor more details and registration forms,
