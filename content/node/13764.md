body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Word shape</strong>\r\n\r\nWord shape
  is the overall visual impression of the outer boundary of a given word. Word shape
  is attributed as one of the key factors in [[readability]] and is widely considered
  the reason that [[lowercase]] words are more readily recognizable than their [[uppercase]]
  equivalent. The belief is that because uppercase words always have a rectangular
  word shape they are less distinct than lowercase words which have a varying word
  shape, given definition by [[Ascender|ascenders]] and [[Descender|descenders]] that
  create unique, and therefore more recognizable shapes.\r\n\r\nWord shape is believed
  to be one of the two probable ways that information is processed by the eye. Researchers
  are divided between word shape recognition and [[letter identification]] as the
  process by which information is processed during reading.\r\n\r\nSee also [[Readability]]."
