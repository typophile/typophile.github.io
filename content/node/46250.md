body: "So I have done a 15 min Google and Forum search on what is the Best Practices
  on sharing fonts.  Nada.  Generally I don't do share font files, period. I usually
  have partners and vendors purchase their own license. But i would like some further
  insight and opinions and maybe a definitive answer or two.\r\n\r\nhere is the scenario.\r\n\r\nAcme\u2122
  purchased a Full license of Typeface A\r\nAoR purchased a Full license of Typeface
  A\r\n\r\nMedia Partner of AoR and Acme needs fonts to simply EDIT a legacy Rich
  Media placement on a high profile website.\r\n\r\nMedia Partner request Font Files
  from AoR for Rich Media production developer.  Both AoR and Media Partner are actually
  owned by the same Global Holding company.\r\n\r\nconfused yet? i would bet this
  is a fairly common occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt seems a waste of $100-$500 to buy a license
  for something that will be used for 5 mins, and published for 4-5 days. And and
  of which two other entities have already purchased font licenses for the same original
  document.  All that will happen is Website will invoice Media, Media will Invoice
  Acme\u2122, and Acme\u2122 ends up paying twice for the same license, and if this
  happens 2-3 a month, it could be 20-30 times a year they pay for the same license
  over and over.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think this is likely a common scenario. I can imagine something like this
    might have happened when Apple used those fake quotes in a Flash ad\u2019 a <A
    HREF=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/41043\">while back</A> - with an angry client
    breathing down your neck you want to get the problem fixed quickly, and keep your
    job. \r\n\r\nBasic EULA answer is that fonts are rarely licensed corporation-wide,
    and most licenses restrict font use to a single company at a single site - so
    unless these entities are all in the same building then loaning a license is going
    to be outside the terms of the EULA. \r\n\r\nIn the real world however there are
    probably three options\u2026  \r\n\r\n1. media partner licenses the fonts. \r\n2.
    media partner uses unlicensed versions of the fonts and then deletes them (no
    one would ever know).\r\n3. media partner uses unlicensed versions of the fonts
    and keeps them.\r\n\r\nAs for the same people licensing the same fonts again and
    again \u2013 that\u2019s really how the font business has always worked, isn\u2019t
    it? \r\n\r\nWhat might be more sensible long-term is for the holding company to
    use a central group for font licensing, where special rights and permissions can
    be negotiated from font vendors to accommodate this type of scenario legally.

  body: "<em>to simply EDIT</em>\r\n\r\nWhat you're describing is not editing, but
    typography.\r\nYou can't do typography without fonts.\r\nTherefore you should
    use licensed fonts.\r\n\r\nIf these corporations choose to weave a complex web
    of ownership, they should be able to figure out how to license the fonts they
    use in an efficient manner!\r\n\r\nI don't mean to pick on large corporations,
    for they are generally straight shooters and good clients when it comes to font
    licensing.\r\n\r\nThey do however, get a lot of breaks from foundries, in particular
    reduced per-terminal licence fees for multiple terminals.\r\n\r\n"

    designer and have them make the changes. BTW - outside designers becoming typography
    houses could probably charge a minimal fee for an editorial change...\r\n\r\nAnd
    sii - as a typographer - we would buy a font from the manufacturer of our equipment
    - if it was a royalty font - we'd pay an additional 30 bucks for each weight in
    royalty fees - then it was ours to do what we wanted with. But please note, it
    was only good for our equipment... and that's the way it use to work."

    text changes can be made \"sight unseen\" without adverse consequences may not

  body: "Yep 4. would have been the obvious answer - assumed there was some kind of
    blocker there.\r\n\r\nBack to the original question...\r\n\r\n>EDIT a legacy Rich
    Media placement\r\n\r\nIf the source files for the \u201CRich Media placement\u201D,
    let\u2019s say it\u2019s an animated .GIF, supported embedded fonts then theoretically
    the font files could be legally included with the sources to allow for future
    editing and re-generation of the .GIF. However, most fonts are set to \u201Cprint
    & preview embedding\u201D - so it wouldn't have been helpful without a license
    upgrade. \r\n\r\nThat comes back to Nick's point - editing is functionality that
    should be paid for. \r\n"
