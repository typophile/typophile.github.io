body: "The rather peculiar <strong>Andron 2 English</strong> renders itself increasingly
  popular recently, especially among British designers.\r\n\r\nI take the great pleasure
  to announce that [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-2/|Andron
  2 English Regular]] now has got most welcome kinship: matching <strong>Italics and
  Semibold</strong> fonts. So the possibilities of fancy typography with Andron English
  \u2013 become three times as great and funny!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/And-2-ENG-muster2_5867.jpg]\r\n\r\nAndron
  2 English Italic and Andron English 2 Semibold feature the usual classic and acknowledged
  original Andron feeling, yet provide the same specific glyph varieties known from
  Andron 2 English Regular. \r\n\r\nAll three fonts have entirely matching glyph sets.
  However: the Italics come with some very special extra: a set of 48 beautiful <strong>typographic
  ornaments.</strong>\r\n\r\nOn request I provide a 2-page specimen PDF (ca. 1,7MB)
  per Mail.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/And-2-ENG-muster1_5728.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
  all orders placed until 31 December (directly to me) I offer <strong>special introduction
  prices</strong> (you\u2019ll save 25% and more from the usual MyFonts prices).\r\nAt
  MyFonts the two new fonts will be available by beginning of the new year.\r\n"

  body: "The use in English of the word \u201Cmock\u201D as an adjective to describe
    an imitation is somewhat like that of the French loan-word \u201Cfaux\u201D, not
    quite so scathing as the way \u201Cmock\u201D is used as a verb.\r\n\r\nMock turtle
    soup is an English soup that was created in the mid-18th century as a cheaper
    imitation of green turtle soup. It often uses brains and organ meats ... [wiki
    description].\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll created the Mock Turtle character for <em>Alice
    in Wonderland</em>: the humour is implicit.\r\n(George Lois did something similar
    in the 1960s, inventing the <a href=\"hhttp://www.georgelois.com/pages/Logos/logos6.html\">Nauga</a>
    beast as the origin of Naugahyde, for a vinyl furniture product.\r\n\r\nIn the
    early 20th century,  a postmodern housing style incorporating elements of Elizabethan
    (16th century) architecture was applied to houses and apartment buildings (blocks
    of flats) in the Anglosphere. This was down-market, and was satirized by the intelligensia
    as \u201CTudorbethan\u201D (Poet Laureate John Betjamin\u2019s neologism of Tudor
    and Elizabethan), or \u201CMock Tudor\u201D\u2014playing on the typographic similarities
    between Mock Turtle and Mock Tudor (homotypy?)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not surprised that
    Andron English, so cleverly evoking <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_England\">Merrie
    England</a>, is a hit in the UK\u2014a tip of my (Robin Hood) hat to you, Andreas!\r\n\r\n"

    to replace all the capitals by blackletter glyphs though, and see what they would
    then make of it.\r\n\r\nB.t.w., the initial idea of this kind of font was actually
    an evocation of *merrie Deutschland* (combined with other capitals) ... hope they
