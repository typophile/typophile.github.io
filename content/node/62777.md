  my \"wisdom\" on all things typography. She's asking for a font to express sarcasm,
  and I think I'd be able to best answer her referencing some of the better known
  ones. \r\n\r\nThe question was certainly intriguing, and nothing comes to mind.
  \r\n\r\nHave any of you attempted to express this idea before with type? What did
  you use? \r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure that a font _can_ go into that particular emotion. The words
    have to do it, and even then, words alone are often misread when sarcasm is intended.
    A tone of voice has to be used. I can't count the number of apologies I have seen
    online where sarcasm has been misread as honest reaction, with bad results. That
    is why the HTML &lt;sarcasm> tag was invented.\r\n\r\nItalics could do the trick,
    if the reader has been conditioned to know that. Offhand I can't think of anyway
    to convey the emotion seamlessly."

  body: I don't think a font by itself can convey sarcasm. But if you pick a font
    that sends a different message than the text, that might work. For example, an
    insult set in something pretty. Of course, it could be tricky to find a font that
    has the right "tone of voice" you're trying to evoke.

  body: I see that as more Chaotic than Sarcastic, Stephen. To me sarcasm means words
    that disguise themselves with niceness, but have a totally different meaning.
    That disguising is why I suggest it is hard to demonstrate in a typographic way.

    this example was easy \u2013 the sarcasm was communicated mainly because of additional
    knowledge that Typophiles have of that font. Communicating only with the meaning
    of text and the style of the font is harder!\r\n\r\nBTW, \"extremely experienced\"
    was sarcasm too :-)"
