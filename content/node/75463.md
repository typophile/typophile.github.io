  I see there is a world of software online that do this, but they come with specifications
  and limitations that involve unfamiliar vocabulary to me. How can I be sure the
  software I choose is compatible with my client's proprietary font (which contains
  open type figure sets)?\r\n\r\nThanks for any tips."

  body: Transtype might be a good gamble, but if the font is custom the original designer
    can probably provide the most kosher TTF version.

  body: Thanks for the recommendation Sii. I agree asking the original type designer
    to do it would be safest; the task has fallen on me only because the designer
    is not available!

  body: "TransType, as Sii mentioned, is a popular font conversion utility, and cross-platform.
    There's also a newer one called <a href=\"http://www.macupdate.com/dev.php?id=26678\">FontXChange</a>
    for Mac. The open source <a href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\">FontForge</a>
    editor can also convert between formats.\r\n\r\nFontXChange and FontForge both
    maintain OpenType features, as well as the Pro version of TransType. TransType
    also does automatic TrueType hinting, which the others do not (though you could
    add autohinting afterward with FontForge or another capable font editor)."
