  to start getting a bit more serious about it. I know I could probably learn what
  I need by doing my own research but Id really like to take a class as my company
  is willing to pay for it ;) St Martins seems to have a course but I missed it. \r\n\r\nhttp://courses.csm.arts.ac.uk/shortcourse.asp?ct=1&ma=3&cat=17&ci=5729\r\n\r\nCan
  any of you suggest another good course in London?"
