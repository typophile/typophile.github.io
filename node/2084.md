body: 'I realize this  may be custom drawn, especially the combined letters, but is
  it based on a font? It bears somewhat of a resemblance to ITC Serif Gothic &#40;at
  least the R&#39;s, which seem characteristic&#41; but some of the letters are wrong.
  Any ideas?  <BR> <BR>Last Temptation Logo: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20531.gif"

  body: The image I&#39;m including was made using a font named Flanders Bold. <BR>Some
    of the leading caps are off, but perhaps were modified? Kerning <BR>was left as-is.

    alt=""> <BR><br> <BR>It&#39;s copyright reads URW &amp; SoftMaker, 1992. Odd bedfellows
    to be sure. <BR>It seems like all of <a href="http://www.softmaker.de/fonts_en.htm"
    target="_blank"> SoftMaker&#39;s</a> fonts are clones of other&#39;s commercial
    <BR>offerings, but URW? I had thought they were legit. Does anyone know <BR>the
    relationship of these two companies, other than that they&#39;re both <BR>Deutsch?
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.urw.de/english/home.htm" target="_blank"> URW</a>
    doesn&#39;t offer Flanders, by that name or, as far as I could find, any <BR>other.
    I&#39;ll be interested to see if anyone can give another, more legitimate <BR>name
    to this this typeface. <BR> <BR>I obtained this font via the <a href="http://www.fontsite.com/Pages/OrderForm/OrderForm1.html"
    target="_blank"> Fontsite CD</a>, which is made up mostly of URW <BR>fonts. <BR><br>

    dodgy history as well. <BR>Unfortunately I can&#39;t give you any hard proof.
    All I know is  <BR>FontShop took several years to decide if they were going to  <BR>carry
    them or not, and even then they were never included  <BR>in the official catalogue.
    So their background must be  <BR>dodgier than <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14101.html#POST24463"
    target="_blank"> Bitstream</a>&#39;s.

  body: I think &#39;Flanders&#39; is a clone of Les Usherwood&#39;s <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=BQ90106003P1"
    target="_blank">&#34;Flange&#34;</a>. It comes in 4 weights, with italics. I think
    this logo was Flange Regular &#40;Book&#41;.

  body: Bingo! I&#39;d looked at Flange in a book &#40;Lawrence Wallis&#39; <i>Modern
    <BR>Encyclopedia of Typefaces 1960-90</i> as well as Berthold&#39;s PDF <BR>catalog,
    but several characters, notably the A &amp; E didn&#39;t match <BR>up at all in
    the book and that PDF is about as useful as the <BR>website &#40;not!&#41;. Phil&#39;s
    Fonts&#39; sample image gives a much clearer <BR>picture. Thanks guys. <BR> <BR>How
    did Phil&#39;s Fonts manage to retain sales rights? Cool.

  body: I think Berthold allowed Phil&#39;s to continue selling their fonts because
    it was agreed that the Phil&#39;s pricing would be identical to Berthold&#39;s.
    I think Adobe&#39;s bundling practices &#40;or lack of it in some cases&#41; meant
    that Berthold wasn&#39;t getting as much control over the pricing as they wanted
    when the new owners took over Berthold.  Someone else here probably knows the
    story in better detail, but that&#39;s the impression I got from discussions of
    the Berthold ownership change I have seen in various newsgroups.
