  name of the gorgeous handwritten font used on Madonna's album and single releases
  from her \"Confession on a Dancefloor\" covers?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\ndoc.theopolis"

  body: I'd wonder if it wasn't just the designers handwriting. There isn't very much
    consistency.

    ask!\r\nfor some reason i find the thinness really intriguing."

  body: "I think Tiffany's absolutely right that this script is handwriting, but there
    are some new OpenType handwritten fonts like <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000104\">Dear
    Sarah</a> that have many alternate characters, endings and ligatures that allow
    simulation of rather realistic handwriting.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Gah! No pun intended. )"

  body: yes, but in this case the lettering varies from sample to sample. that'd take
    more work to make a font than to just write it out in the first place. :P
