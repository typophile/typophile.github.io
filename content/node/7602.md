body: Hello, <BR> <BR>As a recent graduate I would like to ask for some advice with
  my first piece of work please. <BR> <BR>Could anyone recommend a typeface suitable
  for information text panels within a local museum/gallery space? The brief states
  I must use &#34;Arial&#34;. I really don&#39;t want to mainly because I don&#39;t
  feel it is appropriate for the gallery content &#40;18th century photography&#41;I
  would like to use a serif, but I&#39;m sure there are other suitable sans serif
  faces I could suggest?  <BR> <BR>Maybe this is the norm, and maybe I should use
  this typeface but I would prefer to argue the case for another.  <BR> <BR>The gallery
  is very conscious of legibility issues which I feel is right, but leaves me unsure
  about the legibilty of other typefaces due to my lack of experience in the field.
  <BR> <BR>Any suggestions or is my question a little vague? <BR> <BR>Thank you.

  body: Isabel, contact The Metropolitian Museum of Art. I don&#39;t know the site
    name but it might be <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org" target="_blank">www.metmuseum.org</a>,
    they do a bang-up job of using text panels and they never use Arial. I bet a designer
    their would be glad to help you.

    century&#42;, but they I saw that you&#39;re in the UK... What about FF Bau? <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Wasn&#39;t photography invented in the late <i>19th</i> century? <BR>
    <BR>Whatever you choose, resists the temptation to make it so legible as to remove
    all character, while avoiding a dreamy fall into <i>too much</i> character at
    the expense of clarity. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: do you mean nineteenth century photography, isabel? <BR> <BR>in that case,
    maybe consider so-called &#39;romantic&#39; faces like bulmer and walbaum; slab
    serifs &#40;clarendon&#41;; and early grots &#40;Caslon&#39;s Egyptian from the
    font bureau&#41;. and there&#39;s a whole world of victorian display faces for
    titling etc. <BR> <BR>let me know if you&#39;d like more info on any of these.

  body: Photography was invented in the early 19th century, by means of simultaneous
    developments among a number of researchers &#40;Daguerre, Herschel, Niepce, Talbot&#41;
    who were all exploiting Schulze&#39;s 1727 discovery of silver nitrate darkening
    on exposure to light. <BR> <BR>The French government considered the invention
    so important that they bought Niepce and Daguerre&#39;s patent&#40;s&#41; and
    put them in the public domain. <BR> <BR>The first book containing photos was Talbot&#39;s
    &#34;The Pencil of Nature&#34; &#40;1846&#41;. <BR> <BR>Many further big technical
    breakthroughs in portability didn&#39;t come until the early 20th century. Portable
    flash photography &#40;developed in large part by my great-grandfather, George
    R Lawrence&#41;; the 35mm camera in 1925 &#40;Barnack&#41; was another huge advance
    in portability; and then faster films made it possible to do away with the flash
    altogether. Then you got color, and the Polaroid, all before 1950. <BR> <BR>Any
    museum/gallery using Arial for exhibit labels didn&#39;t have a decent typographer
    involved in their development. I&#39;d agree with most of the above suggestions,
    except that stuff like Bulmer and Walbaum is probably not best for readability
    under sub-optimal conditions &#40;which exhibits usually are, in my experience&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Personally, I&#39;d go with a good humanist sans serif, if the client
    is hung up on sans serifs. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks for all the info, really helpful. <BR> <BR>Perhaps I should first clear
    something up, I wasn&#39;t really very clear in my first post. I was refering
    to various artists who had photographed /illustrated 18th century culture for
    the exhibition, I didn&#39;t mean to say that it was photography from the 18th
    century. Wasn&#39;t very clear sorry. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I have been looking at
    using a serif for the header text and a sans serif for the body text. Most books
    I have been reading through, &#40;mostly page layout&#41; recommend the opposite.
    Would I be making a mistake attempting this?  <BR> <BR>Anyway I will experiment
    with your suggestions and see how it sits with a Serif header. Something with
    small, subtle serifs? I originally wanted something from the 18th century, but
    now I am searching further a field, after little success. <BR> <BR>Thanks

    text you have, the more sans is a bad idea. <BR> <BR>But for the heading, simply
    figure out the flavor you want. <BR>Sans and serif give different flavors, but
    functionally they&#39;re both fine for headings. <BR> <BR>&#34;Use only sans for
    heading&#34; is naive Modernism. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Personally, I&#39;d avoid sans if you can. I think it&#39;d seem a bit incongruous.
    And, if the museum uses Arial &#40;unwisely&#41; everywhere else, the sans&#39;s
    character will pop more in that context. Also, if the focus is 18th century culture,
    I&#39;d go with something period-specific that seems, to the average viewer, more
    related. <BR> <BR>geraint, is Caslon&#39;s Egyptian for sale on Font Bureau&#39;s
    site? I can&#39;t find it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d recommend Kent Lew&#39;s <a href="http://kentlew.com/Type.html">Whitman</a>,
    for a variety of non-historical reasons, but it doesn&#39;t have a bold italic,
    which I imagine you&#39;d need in a museum setting. &#40;Check it out anyway,
    &#39;cause it&#39;s great.&#41;
