  I ended up thrawling through old documents at Litteraturbanken.se, which is a good
  resource for swedish type from the time.\r\n\r\nOf course, my knowledge is somewhat
  limited in the area. [[http://litteraturbanken.se/#!forfattare/AlfEP/titlar/StroddaSkaldestycken/sida/15/faksimil|This
  anthology page]] (and the rest of the book, click through if you want, press the
  little \"5\" icon to zoom) is printed almost entirely in an unfamiliar Italic, which
  is clearly not Caslon but shares some similar properties. Still, that looped w,
  that squarish a, that oblique g, that rather extreme cursiveness... what is this?
  Also note the Roman capital G's supremely right-leaning barb.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lb2428951_5_0036_6486.jpeg]"

  body: "(Btw, look at those crazy diacritics: \xF6 still has the archaic form with
    the tiny superscript e while the \xE4 has both the archaic and the modern form
    all mixed up. \xE5 seems to be most often (but not consistently) printed as \xE2,
    which I confess to never having seen before, was it a failed reform attempt?)"

  body: To an extent (and Janson seems to have been common at the time), but it does
    differ in quite a lot of details from all the digital revivals I've seen.
