body: "Hey everyone\r\n\r\nI am designing a book that a friend has written in which
  every other chapter is a letter. The book is called <em>Cursive</em>.\r\n\r\nMy
  friend is very keen to use a cursive/handwritten font for the letters but we both
  have some concerns about the legibilty of such long passages of text set out in
  this way.\r\n\r\nSo - I was wondering if any typophiles might be able to recommend
  a script that might work for extended reading like this? In the book, the letters
  are hand written by an American man to his lover in the late 1930's. Historical
  accuracy with the script would be nice to have, but it is probably not essential
  - legibility and generally looking good is more important. \r\n\r\nMy friend quite
  liked \"American Scribe\" (which is not particularly appropriate date-wise) but
  what put him off was the long horizontal crossbars on the t's as he felt they were
  too intrusive.\r\n\r\nIf we can't find anything appropriate that works, then the
  fall-back option is to simply use an italic for the letters. In any other circumstances,
  I think this would be my preferred option, but as the book itself is called <em>Cursive</em>,
  my friend feels it is important to have a cursive script and I take his point.\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate any suggestions you might have\r\n\r\nthanks."

    Spencerian as the norm for American schoolchildren. Samples of true Palmer penmanship

    nursing home and line up the 90+ year old men. Ask them to write a test sentence,
    then hire the best to transcribe the letters. Be sure to set a tight deadline
    and pick a healthy candidate. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

  body: "@oldnick\r\nThanks for the introduction to the Palmer method and Spencerian
    which I didn't know about  - while these may be historically accurate, I feel
    they look far too businesslike and formal - particularly the caps in the Intellecta
    design font you referenced which seem very OTT. I think the type needs to be less
    intellectual and more real life/gritty.\r\n\r\n@JamesM\r\nOther than using a cursive
    font to differentiate the letters from the regular chapters - no.\r\n\r\n@nina\r\nIf
    it was just a book of letters I think that would certainly be a possibility -
    but as these letter chapters will be interspersed with regular chapters set in
    roman type (probably Klim's Fejoia), I'm not sure something like dolly would be
    sufficiently different to give an adequate contrast at those sizes. \r\n\r\ngeraintf\r\nha
    - you wouldn't say that if you had seen my handwriting...\r\n\r\n@Sii\r\nIf there
    was the time and the budget, then that would be a pretty good idea! Unfortunately
    there is very little budget (I'm doing the cover and layout for free) and it needs
    to be up on Lulu.com in 2 weeks in time for the Christmas \"rush\" - I think my
    chances of finding a 90 year old that could provide the required 200 pages or
    so of handwriting in time to hit that deadline are fairly remote - and I wouldn't
    want to be responsible for their \"premature\" passing - especially if they hadn't
    quite finished....\r\n\r\n\r\nTime constraints more than anything mean that I
    really do need to use a typeface for this - so I would be interested to hear any
    more suggestions you may have. One thing I would add is that the script needs
    to make a reasonably efficient use of space as every page costs money on lulu..."

    Pro</a>-- it has relatively short extenders, so will make a good book page, not
    too airy.\r\nAlso the Pro version has proper cursive construction, with short
    exit strokes at the end of words, for sharp word spaces.\r\n(You can examine this
    by clicking \"Contextual Alternates\" at the MyFonts type tester.)\r\nAnd you
    get a choice of pens.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@Nick Shinn\r\nHandsome Pro Classic is a good suggestion - it certainly ticks
    the boxes as far as efficiency and legibility goes - however I find it a little
    too feminine and friendly for this, it just hasn't got quite the right feel.\r\n\r\n@Frode
    \r\nNow that is an excellent suggestion. I hadn't considered the upright italics.
    I love the Seria italic and Joos looks good too. It gives a strong indicator of
    the pen, whilst being efficient, legible and reasonably comfortable on the eye
    for extended reading. I'm not sure that Seria italic fits that well with Feijoa
    though - and Seria is a little to spindly for the main copy, but it would probably
    work well with Scala for the main text.\r\n\r\n@Ale\r\nCertainly some great scripts
    there Ale but again, none seem to have quite the right feel for this.\r\n\r\nThe
    more I think about it, the more certain I become that the scripts that seem to
    have the right feel (like American Scribe, Lamar Pen etc) are all going to be
    inefficient, impractical and hard on the eye given the amount of text that needs
    to be set in them.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can think of a script that is as efficient
    and legible as Nick's Handsome, but a bit more gritty, then I would be interested
    to hear about it but otherwise I think I am probably going to go down the upright
    italics route as suggested by Frode.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help on this one guys
    - much appreciated."
