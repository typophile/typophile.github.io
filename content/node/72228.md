  boat, done about 3 years ago and unfortunately this is the only image I have. Any
  assistance is greatly appreciated!

  body: "I spent a lot of time yesterday looking for this, but I could not pin down
    a category to search within. It has a fantasy book/game, or comic book, feel to
    it, and often I think freebie fonts are used for those, and so I searched a lot
    at Dafont with no success. Can you give more information about this sample and
    its origin?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I did some more searching at MyFonts using 'heavy metal' and came up with
    something sort of similar in feel: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/ravenwood/\">Ravenwood</a>,
    but that was the closest I saw. Searching 'goth' also pulled up a few that were
    roughly similar. I am also going to look at 'blackletter' fonts, since several
    of the similar styles used that keyword too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Unfortunately I don't have a lot of info on this - it's a vinyl decal applied
    to a boat about 3 years ago, so there's a chance that it could be custom, and
    not a font at all. I definitely appreciate your help!!!
