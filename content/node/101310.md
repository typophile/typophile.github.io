body: "I've just released a new free font called SONAR SCRIPT available for free download
  at  the Floodfonts website. If you want to see more in-use examples you are invited
  to visit the Behance project: http://bit.ly/103LIko\r\n\r\nSONAR SCRIPT is a modular,
  experimental typeface that plays with the idea to fold a line of text from a continuous
  strip of paper. In spite of its technical and contemporary appearance, the overall
  impression of the typeface is unusual and very characteristic! SONAR SCRIPT works
  really well to create grid-based, geometric layouts with large letters or to design
  logotypes.\r\n\r\nI was convinced and excited about the idea to develop a script
  font that does not rely on handwritten letters. Many design principles of written
  characters also apply when folding letters, for example the need of the writer to
  develop the word of one continuous stroke. And also the definition of the lettershape
  by the angle of the pen nib can be applied to the fold angle of the paper strip.
  Many problems were similar to standard font development but in some places unusual
  new solutions had to be found that give SONAR SCRIPT its distinct character.\r\n\r\nThe
  free font is available at: http://www.floodfonts.com/freefont/sonar.html\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sonar_TypeSpecimen_480px_5163.png]"

  body: Very nice.  Just curious - why the name change? Comparing SonarScript and
    Rollmops, the only difference I see is buried in the Panose description.   - Herb

  body: I had to rename the font because Kombinat Typefounders registered Sonar as
    a trademark. But I think the new name fits also well...
