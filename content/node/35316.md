    styles in here. I speak no German, and professionally, I was more interested in
    the sign designs, so this document was plenty good enough for me.\r\n\r\nOn a
    personal level I shall be interested to see what this thread throws up."

    DIN Engschrift.\r\n\r\nFF DIN is based on the road sign font. \r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"
