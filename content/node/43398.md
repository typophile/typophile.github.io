body: "As I was standing in the checkout line at a Tokyo supermarket my eye met this
  Arabic numeral \"1\".  For a while I was struck dumb - what tha! is that a serif
  - with serifs? It was disorienting - a typographical zen koan- what am I seeing?
  \ Then I thought of the poor lettering designer unused to Latin letters and interpreting
  the 1's upper stroke (can it be called a serif?) in his or her own way. I almost
  burst out laughing. I later came and took a photo of the sign. The green variation
  is my photoshopped vision of what a serif with serifs with serifs ...might look
  like. Keep adding serifs like this and you get a fractal...\r\nHave you seen anything
  else that is funny? I do not mean ugly or badly-designed glyphs or letters, but
  something that would make a typographer laugh.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serif-of-serifs_6731.jpg]"

  body: Back in school I attended a presentation by... Hoefler, I think, but I may
    not be remembering correctly. Anyway, he was leading us through the design of
    a typeface, and apparently the creation of swash characters had become a bit much,
    and he had to indulge in a little self-parody. Imagine an octothorpe, a slash,
    a period... all with a big ol' Bookman swash extending from the upper left, or
    as close to an upper left as could be had.

    ago of letters with endlessly iterating serifs... Well the idea was infinite iterations
    of serifs, but it gets crowded really fast so it only got to about 4 or 5 levels.
    And it was the Goudy Copperplate 1 that gave me the idea. It's odd. It looks like

    - nothing new under the sun I guess! <em>Well the idea was infinite iterations

    As to getting crowded that would not happen if each iteration gets smaller- it
    will be much like a mathematical fractal where the original has a given outline,
    and succeeding iterations become smaller and more complex - one has to zoom to
    see them. Fascinating stuff really- I just tried the freeware program ChaosPro
    to produce fractals but there may be less difficult programs that demonstrate
    the results only as animations."

    Copperplate Gothic was designed to be used mostly on small sizes, especially business
    cards, and those \"serifs\" all over the letter are a compensation means for the
    ink (negative inktraps). Am I daydreaming or maybe there is some evidence of this?

    signs and in large applications is awfully bad\u2026\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ah, I forgot.
