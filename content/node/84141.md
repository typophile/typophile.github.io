  a couple weeks back I began by drawing a demibold and derived an ultralight from
  it, keeping the point structures compatible. My ultralight looked great & spaced
  fine on screen, but after the first test print I was scratching my head. David:
  \"Yeah, the lighter weight looks much too big compared to the heavier weight at
  the same size. I get that.\" Pause. \"But why... um. Why does it look like something
  Herb Lubalin drew?\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2901_4278.jpg]\r\n\r\nMark:
  \"Oh it's looking groovy?\" I walk from the printer over to Mark thinking 'Is groovy
  some kind of precise typographic term I'm unfamiliar with?' Mark after seeing it:
  \"Yeah, it's pretty groovy.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2900_3551.jpg]\r\n\r\nThough
  not perhaps used as such, in my mind <em>groovy</em> just as well be a precise typographic
  term. It would mean something like 'a condition achieved when display type appears
  in a text setting, looking too tight, too light, having lost much of its detail,
  & generally, like ITC Souvenir set small from phototype.' \r\nIn addition to spacing
  the ultralight more generously, I exaggerated the serifs and got into the habit
  of regularly taking breaks to view the monitor from about ten feet back, in between
  trips to the printer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-2_3462.gif]\r\n\r\nAbove:
  The phrase 'times are altered' appears in an interpolated light weight somewhere
  between the ultralight and the demibold (also shown), with a little condensed thrown
  in for good measure."

    not in fact improve the <em>measure</em>, a precise typographic term."
