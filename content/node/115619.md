  in the 1896 ATF specimen book. It didn't make it into the 1897 one, or any later
  ones, apparently.\r\n\r\nWhile it wouldn't be mistaken for any of those faces, it
  seems to anticipate some of the features of both Times Roman and Perpetua.\r\n\r\nI
  had been thinking about this because I thought I had seen an image of William Starling
  Burgess' original sketches on the Internet somewhere, but I couldn't find them again;
  I wanted to compare them, rather than the face Starling, to Times Roman."

    during the phototypesetting era:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArtGoth_5115.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Quaint_4832.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rubens_6685.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Washington_5791.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    could have been that the lettering from Art Deco era posters, not Quaint itself,
    was the basis of the later faces I'm thinking of, though.\r\n\r\nIt was also interesting
    to me that Columbus, featured in the 1897 specimen, gave rise to American Italic
    which appeared in a later one."

    given that appellation:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeVinne_5290.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
    are Columbus and American Italic, as I mentioned; the latter was in the 1906 specimen,
    while Columbus was in 1896 and 1897, but not later:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Colombus_6299.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmItal1906_6386.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    noticed in the Keystone specimen a Caslon Old Style that looked a bit odd:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/COS2_key_5120.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    the sixteen point size, it makes the descenders on Caslon 540 look long. In another
    size,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaslonOld_5324.jpg]\r\n\r\nlook
    closely at the lowercase \"e\". Oh, dear, using pied type for your specimen book."
