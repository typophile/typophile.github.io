  type sheets I inherited from a friend. I've been searching the net frantically for
  a typeface/font version of Bodoni Flair but can't seem to find one. Would anyone
  happen to know where I could purchase this file in the electronic form?\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni_flair_5096.jpg]"

    Miserichordia</a> has a similar feel (at first glance.) As does <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ALT0000144">Perla</a>.
    Hmm, and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/wiescher/bodoni_classic_swashes/">Bodoni
    Classic Swashes</a>. But nothing exactly the same...of which I am aware.

    a further look at that. I appreciate the help!
