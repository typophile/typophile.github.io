  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Gang -</p>
<p>Just started this account because I found LTC Metropolitan through this site, bought the font and love it, and want to make sure a draft colophon I put together seems sound to eyes and minds more experienced than my own.</p>
<hr>
<p>This book has been set in LTC Metropolitan - a 2000 digitization by Gerald Giampa of the celebrated font “Centaur” drawn by Bruce Rogers in 1914.</p>
<p>“Centaur” was in turn a revival and interpretation of the earliest fonts of Venice - the 1475 Roman of Nicolas Jenson &amp; the 1495 types of Francesco Griffo.</p>
<p>For the 1929 Monotype release, Rogers chose as accompanying italic the 1925 font “Arrighi” of Frederic Warde, which had been inspired by the 1520 chancery cursive of Ludovico degli Arrighi.</p>
<hr>
<p>What do you think - dates look right? Any boners?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Michael</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rogers drew upon the type Jenson used to print the <cite>De Evangelica Praeparatione</cite> of Eusebius in 1470. (I&rsquo;m not sure where 1475 comes from.) I&rsquo;ve never heard of any reference to Francesco Griffo&rsquo;s work in relation to Centaur.</p>
<p>A font of 14-point was commissioned by Henry Watson Kent for use by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, hence the name for Giampa&rsquo;s version.</p>

<p>Centaur, in PostScript, in text-size settings (say 11- 12-point) looks terrible in a book &ndash; that is, when printed offset. It looks OK on laser proof, but that is a very different inking system.</p>
<p>This is not the fault of the printer. It is the fault of the designer for choosing the font for text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never used Metropolitan, but a quick look at samples on the website would make me cautious. YMMV.</p>
<hr>
<p>In passing, the 1914 Metropolitan commission was not quite the same font as the Monotype machine versions usually listed as 1929.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You should strive to make your usage consistent. I would shy away from quotation marks, but if clarity demands that you set apart the font names, go ahead and use italics, bold, small caps, or whatever works for you &ndash; as long as all the font names including LTC Metropolitan are treated the same.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me second what both Kent &amp; Charles have written.</p>
<p>As Kent suggests, you need to do a bit more reading about Centaur. For a very cursory telling of the tale, see</p>
<p><a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/web/extras/bruce-rogers-centaur">http://harvardmagazine.com/web/extras/bruce-rogers-centaur</a></p>
<p>You might also look for a copy of the book &ldquo;Centaur Types.&rdquo; Rogers wrote it and supervised composition and printing in the late 1940s. A few years ago some copies came on the market.</p>
<p>&amp; Charles is right about Centaur in text settings. It is an abomination. Carefully spaced in display settings it can be OK if paired with the right text face. Unfortunately, too many people have heard in design class that Centaur is one of the great types. &amp; that is true of the metal version, if it is well printed. But they have been taught very little about how to evaluate a classic type in versions other than the one it was designed for. So they use it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you are still reading this thread, and while I do think the criticisms expressed here are valid, it isn&rsquo;t like we all didn&rsquo;t make similar mistakes (if you agree they are such) along the way, &amp; usually repeat them in slightly different ways, every day.</p>
<p>It is hard to learn to think about media, esp. when something like &ldquo;print&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t one media. Papers differ, and take the ink differently. Technologies differ, e.g., metal and photocomp, as do their usual parings, letterpress &amp; offset &ndash; though metal comp is occasionally printed offset, &amp; photocomp printed with polymer plates. Xerography is different still, as is the computer screen. Viewed this way there are a lot of different medias, even though they are often lumped into just two.</p>
<p>No one I know is an expert in all these areas. And our expectations of type are such that the type itself is not what matters, it is the &ldquo;printing&rdquo; that counts. In learning our craft, we all have, and continue to stumble, usually more often that we succeed.</p>
<p>So write you colophon, keep on working, &amp; we hope you will keep on posting to typophile.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Charles</p>
