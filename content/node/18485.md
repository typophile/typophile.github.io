  is available in digital form somewhere ? I'm quite sure I saw it used on a flyer
  designed by Dutch studio Coup in Amsterdam a few weeks ago, but I could be wrong,
  of course. Thank you very much."

    Modern is a text face with Roman, Italic and Bold.\r\nThanks, anyway"

    it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
