  Is , and What The Font has not responded all afternoon with this, or another request
  so I must relent and ask for some expert help. \r\n2 images same sign, differing
  qualities, they are all I have to work with with mock up deadline tomorrow. Any
  and all help is greatly appreciated. The closest I have found are Miles, Macbeth,
  and Tempas Sans ITC and all of those are still way off. \r\nThe word Salon seems
  to be the same font as Styles By Glenda but maybe stretched a bit.\r\n"

  body: "It looks like <strong>Dorovar Carolus</strong> by Casady & Greene [1988-91]\r\nAccording
    to Luc Devroye, the company is permanently out of business since July 2003 and
    the fonts are now probably in the public domain:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>On July 3,
    2003, Casady&Greene closed it doors permanently. However, one of its designers,
    Mike Wright, writes: I believe that all the fonts that were developed by the company
    are now in the public domain. Robin Casady and I are thinking of putting up a
    site with free downloads of all of the old C&G public domain fonts--mainly as
    a way of attracting Mac users to see iData 2.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27509.html\r\n\r\nThe
    actual font used in your design could be a clone of Dorovar Carolus called <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Carolingia%20-%20Regular&fid=4565451cb158af1f074941981c6b9cf8&fsize=60&text=Salon%20Styles%20By%20Glenda&wrap=2|Carolingia]]</strong>

  body: Dorovar Carolus is an exact match on everything but the capital G, the sign
    has a cross bar on the G where the font doesn't. That could have been added by
    the sign maker to make the G more pronounced. I am going to mock up with this
    font, thank you so very much for your assistance. Admin may mark this thread as
    solved.
