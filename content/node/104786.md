body: There's been much discussion in the UK press about the new Th symbol proposed
  by Australian inventor Paul Mathis as a substitute for the definite article (the).  I've
  included a glyph for this in my latest font - Dynatron - just released on MyFonts.  I've
  also included a version - Dynatron Mathis - which allows users to access the Th
  symbol in one stroke using the seldom used grave symbol (`) on the top left hand
  of the standard American and British keyboards.  What do you guys think?  I'm aware
  that Dynatron is basically a display face, and the utility of the Th symbol is mainly
  for texting etc., but you've got to start somewhere!

    be done 30 years ago. Today many tools can serve but here is something for OS
    X 10.8 with a touch and feel you can't beat :)\r\n\r\nDownload the <a href=\"http://www-01.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=94\">SIL
    Ukelele Mac OS X Keyboard Layout Editor</a> (and copy in the Applications folder).
    Then start Ukelele (on OS X 10.8 you may need to control click the application
    to bypass a security check), then click <code>File &gt; New From Current Input
    Source</code>; you will see your normal keyboard appear. Then double click on
    ` (or another key that you seldom use) and write \"the \" (without quotes) in
    the little box that appears and click OK. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/enter-string_5818.png\">\r\n\r\nYou
    will now see the modified keyboard; here is what I get from my US Extended layout.
    \r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/newlayout_3438.png\">\r\n\r\nThen click <code> Keyboard
    &gt; Set Keyboard Name..</code> and choose the name that will show in the keyboard
    menu, for instance \"Personal\". If you want your keyboard to be unicode, select
    <code>Keyboard &gt; Set Keyboard ID...</code> and choose Unicode. Then <code>File
    &gt; Save As...</code>; I choose <code>Personal.keylayout</code> and I save it
    on the Desktop.\r\n\r\nThe file needs to be moved to the \"Keyboard Layouts\"
    folder in your \"Library\" but on OS X 10.8, it won't show up as it used to. Instead,
    open the <code>Terminal</code> application (in <code>Applications folder/Utilities</code>)
    and then paste the following three lines into the terminal window (instead of
    typing; you can paste the three lines together):\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\ncd ${HOME}/Library/'Keyboard
    Layouts'\r\nopen .\r\nmv ${HOME}/Desktop/Personal.keylayout .\r\n</PRE>\r\nIf
    you see this appear, everything is fine so far\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/layouts-folder_6366.png\">\r\n\r\n
    If not, make sure <code>Personal.keylayout</code> is on the desktop and try again.
    (The same recipe works on 10.7, 10.6 etc but it was easier by then). In fact,
    once that folder is open, you can also just drag your layout there.\r\n\r\nYou
    now log out and log in, then in <code>System Preferences</code> you double click
    <code>Language & Text &gt; Input Sources</code>; you will see a list of keyboards
    appear. I assume you have the box for Australian checked, then maybe also that
    for US. Extended (or US international - PC) and you now also check the box for
    Personal, your new keyboard. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/input-sources_4809.png\">\r\n\r\nYou
    also check <code>Show Input menu in menu bar</code> at the bottom and you should
    now see the keyboard menu at in the top right corner of your screen. If I select
    it, here is what I see. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/keyboards-menu_6290.png\">\r\n\r\nI
    can now select any of those keyboards at my will. When the Personal keyboard is
    selected, every time I type a backquote, I get \"the \". You can also select \"Show
    Keyboard Viewer\" and see this appear:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/keyboard-view_5965.png\">\r\n\r\nand
    show it to your friends. You can also switch from one keyboard to the other by
    typing \"command space\". \r\n\r\nSuch keyboard layouts are handy if you frequently
    need special characters for edition (or to provide input to the kerning window
    of some font editing program) and you don't want to copy paste all the time from
    a cheat sheet; this also shows that there is not a one to one relationship between
    key hits and characters; usually things are the other way around though; so called
    dead keys are used to get one unicode character from many keystrokes; for instance
    to input the single character \xE9 (eacute, <code>U+00E9</code>) to  your text
    file using the US Extended keyboard, you need to  type first \"alt e\" and then
    \"e\". Designing such a keyboard layout with Ukelele is more tricky."

    to me that very few have addressed the utility of the Th symbol as an idea.  Most
    have focussed on such technicalities as the fact that it already exists as a glyph

    didn't ask.\r\n\r\nOdd notion, though. A \"squib\" is a light load, usually because
    of a  mistake, and when fired, fails to affect the target. If it's wet, it just
    won't fire at all, but then, when wet, neither will a regular load. \"Damp\" is

    a reward, you can read texts with lots of \"the\" and see them display as \u040B. "

  body: "> If I were to meet all your technical objections - produce a text font with
    an upper and lower case Th symbol (and Unicode and PC manufacturers could be persuaded
    to assign it a 'legitimate' place on the keyboard), what then would be your objection
    to the Th symbol? Why wouldn't you use it?\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is \u201Cthe\u201D
    keyboard? This is a question for OS vendors more than PC vendors.\r\n\r\nBut without
    rat-holing on such details, if these parenthesized events were to happen, and
    the standard US and UK/international-English keyboards for Windows and Mac OS
    issued by Microsoft and Apple gained direct support for this as a character, it
    would probably be reflective of general public demand for the thing. So sure,
    I would support it. But then, I tend to make fonts with 300-3000 glyphs. As it
    is visually identical to the Serbian cyrillic letter Tshe, those of us who make
    Latin+Cyrillic typefaces would have no extra work.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think you
    have the cart before the horse. Unless it achieves widespread usage somewhere,
    by some mechanism, the OS vendors would never go to the trouble of supporting
    it. The last time a big shift like this happened on English-language fonts and
    keyboards was for the euro symbol in the late 1990s. Somehow this does not seem
    quite as strong a motivating force.\r\n\r\nBTW, Keith, you're the one being overly
    dismissive\u2014of other people\u2019s reactions if they are anything other than
    enthusiastic support. Anybody who thinks is is not a great idea does not have
    \u201Can open mind\u201D? That\u2019s not going to win friends and influence people.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the eth and thorn are not from \u201COld Norse\u201D but in fact from Old English.
    Our language had not one but two letters in this area before. They are still in
    most fonts today because of their continued survival in Icelandic. One could just
    use one of those letters and you\u2019d have just about all existing retail fonts
    supporting it right off the bat. I expect you would object to that because you
    want it to look more like a combo of T and h (or t and h), correct? It might help
    if you actually responded to this question.\r\n\r\n> The point is not that the
    glyph may already exist but that it is generally adopted as a substitute for 'the'
    in written English and in an ideal world assigned its own place on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nWell,
    character, not glyph\u2014and the implementation affects things like what it looks
    like.\r\n\r\n> As to making money, why is everyone so sniffy about it? Don't we
    all hope to make a modest income from our typographical efforts?\r\n\r\nI don't
    mind if he wants to make money on a helpful app. If the symbol were trademarked,
    that would be a problem.\r\n\r\nThe new symbol would need a name (like \u201Campersand\u201D
    instead of \u201Cand\u201D). Calling it \u201Cthe\u201D is ambiguous."

  body: "@Keith Tricker: As a Th ligature, I quite like the character. Why did you
    decide to omit any visual reference to the presence of an e? As \u201CThe,\u201D
    it bears such a close visual relationship to \u201CTh\u201D that extending it
    to \u201CThe\u201D is a difficult leap in that it requires your thinking to go
    from a very literal interpretation, to that one is more abstract. It\u2019s as
    though I am being lead down a certain path which I understand, and am then asked
    to radically change directions in an unexpected way (if that makes any sense).
    If there were a visual cue to the presence of an \u201Ce,\u201D I think people
    would get it instantly. You could also argue the opposite, that if the entire
    character were more of an abstraction, you may not have competing modes of interpretation.\r\n\r\nI
    might also recommend a video that takes itself more seriously. The first time
