  in time.\r\n\r\nI've got some more days left, and wanted to ask, what not to miss
  in Berlin, typographically?\r\n\r\nAny museums, exhibitions, foundries to visit?
  Any signage to look out for?\r\n\r\nAll tips appreciated!"

    Berlin, although the city is awash in type designers! \r\n\r\nIn terms of letters,
    I love to visit the city's many cemeteries. Here are a few photos \u2013 http://www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/sets/72157600961533746/\r\n\r\nThe
    Bode Museum on the Museumsinsel has lots of letters in its basement medieval collection,
    and also in its large coin collection. The Bauhaus-Archiv might have lettering,
    but I've not been inside it. There are a number of Soviet and East German memorials
    with expressionistic stone-carved letters, too. If you go up to the top of the
    Reichstag, and look down into one of the courtyards, you can see a large lettered
    installation by Hans Haake.\r\n\r\nNear the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz there are a series
    of Rosa Luxemburg quotes set as inlaid metal letters into the pavement."
