body: As I understand it, Mongolian can be written vertically &#40;top-to-bottom&#41;;
  but unlike other vertical scripts the lines progress from left-to-right. <BR> <BR>The
  ascent field in the OpenType VHEA table &#40;version 1.0&#41; indicates that the
  ascent is the distance from the centerline to the previous line&#39;s descent.  This
  sounds like the ascent is leftwards-pointing. <BR> <BR>But version 1.1 of VHEA changes
  the name &#40;vertTypoAscender&#41; and the semantics of the field, very carefully
  indicating that it extends from the center to the right...of the ideographic em-box.  This
  description makes me suspicious; I would like to think that the correction was complete,
  but it appears to assume that vertical scripts are ideographic. <BR> <BR>Following
  the version 1.1 definition means that the ascent describes the amount of space after
  &#40;not before&#41; a Mongolian line.  I suppose that&#39;s fine, but it changes
  the way I think about ascent.
