    thing close I could find is [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/red_rooster/gargoyle_light/|Gargoyle
    Light]], it has a similar feel, somewhat...\r\n\r\nPerhaps based on similar samples??"

  body: Must have been changed again, because now "BENJAMIN BUTTON" is set in [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lanston_type/ltc_kennerley_regular_pro/?sample_text=BENJAMIN%20BUTTON|LTC
    Kennerley]].

  body: "Hey, just joined Typophile to try and answer this question. I have seen a
    lot of answers on the web to which font is used in the Benjamin Button promo material
    but don't think it is solved in any of them. Not sure if this is because the typeface
    keeps getting changed over time or what ...\r\n\r\nAttached is the font I'm interested
    in. Definitely not Minion. Kennerley looks close but has 3 terminals on the upper
    case W, whereas the BB font has 4. Also Kennerley italic has circular dots on
    the i and j, whereas this one has diamonds. The leading swashes on the v and w
    (italic) also don't match.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if anyone can identify it!\r\n\r\nEd"

    I never really looked at the italic before though, it's always been the roman
