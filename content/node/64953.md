body: "I've been mulling over Kabel for some time now, and yesterday I decided to
  jump in, and do my version of Kabel-isque font. It has no metric or proportional
  or direct design of Kabel, since I keep finding issues with the original. The fact
  is I really like the overall feel of Kabel, but when I take a closer look, it just
  throws me off.\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to make my own version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_5329.png]\r\nThis
  is medium weight, and there'll be five or six other weights.\r\n\r\nIt has pretty
  much the same feel as Kabel, but now I can live with the glyph design as well. This
  is less than two days' work, so be gentle, but what do you think? I already know
  that uc M and lc g need work.\r\n"

  body: "I see your points, but in my opinion, I've made a whole new and differet
    version of Kabel with different x-height, weight(s), and with quite a few totally
    different glyphs. As you can see here, the ITC and Adobe/Linotype versions are
    pretty different from each other, as well as my take is very different from them:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test1_3475.png]\r\n\r\nHere
    is glyph 'a' with my design, then ITC and then Adobe with same point size:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/testi2_5098.png]\r\n\r\nI
    found ITC x-height way too tall, and Adobe too small, so determined mine to my
    liking. Also, glyphs 'n, 'm', 'h' and 'u' have sharp connection instead of smooth
    like in 'a' above; and there are many more differences over the whole character
    set.\r\nI've gone through my sample books, and both Adobe and ITC have taken some
    liberties from the Koch original. I think the most honest to original fonts is
    Elsner + Flake versions."

  body: "I was a bit harsh in my initial comments. Yes I agree that \r\nITC Kabel
    with its huge x-height is a parody of Koch's original. \r\nBut the small x-height
    of Koch's type \u2013 meaning tall ascenders \r\nand descenders \u2013 made it
    very elegant.\r\n\r\nThe sharp rather then rounded connection of your a is a design
    feature\r\nthat could also be applied to b d p and q.\r\n\r\nAnd what will this
    face be called?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes; the small x-height does make Kabel very elegant. I want my version to
    go in the middle area between these existing designs. And I like some of the seventies
    posters made with ITC Kabel with the heavier weights, so I think I'm keeping the
    current x-height. (I might make a tall ascender/descender version as well\u2026)\r\n\r\nI
    did try out the sharp connections for b,d,p and q as well, but when I tried that
    on the 'b', I wanted to keep it in Bauhaus-style, so it looked somewhat wonky.
    Therefore round connections.\r\n\r\nAs for the name, I'm undecided. Any suggestions?
    STF Kabel? Tabel?"

    that heavier weights seem stubbier, but then again, they are.\r\nI do not think
    anyone uses the whole family for one work (not good English). Heavy weight is
    not usually used with light weight, and so on, so I want to make weights to work
    with one weight removed from between."

  body: "I don't think it's so much that one might use certain weights together (although
    people do) as it has to do with creating a family that has a visually consistent
    design from the lightest to boldest. A big part of the art of type design has
    to do with compensating for visual illusions like this. Making things <em>look</em>
    consistent is more important than having them <em>be</em> consistent.\r\n\r\nIt's
    your design and your decision, but I think you should consider it."

    perfect weight in between weights, but it does not work with every design. With
    Kabel/Kaapeli, it does \u2013 somewhat - but in no way it is a formula everybody
    should go with. I found it appropriate to use with my fonts, but it is hardly
    a bible to type design."

  body: "Walter Tracy in his Letters of Credit has a very astute analysis of the problems
    in Kabel, particularly the lower case, and even suggestions for improvement. I
    think you'd find it very interesting and maybe helpful. \r\n\r\nI think you have
    some problems with widths. Your a to me is too narrow for the rest of the design,
    particularly the e. Tracy criticizes the original m as too narrow. Here you have
    also made the n h u narrow as well, which I think is going to cause problems for
    good rhythm in words. The usual view, as expressed in Tracy's discussion of spacing,
    is that the counters in the h and o need to be not so different in volume. \r\n\r\nI
    think you are right that Kabel has a lot of merits, but also problems in the lower
    case. But I think you need to work on the end result having more even rhythm,
    if the revision is going to be successful. "

  body: "Wow. This is really cool. I've never really liked Kabel either, always rubbed
    me the wrong way, but I like this.\r\n\r\nI don't have much to say as I don't
    feel nearly as experienced as others on this forum, but I will comment that I
    notice the round lowercase letters seem to look bigger in comparison to the other
    lowercase letters as the font gets lighter. This seems to be a result of all of
    the letters except the round ones thinning in character width with the weight
    loss. The o's not too bad, but the p, q, d and b look huge. Perhaps bring the
    stems in closer and loose the full circle? I know that kinda ruins the integrity
    of the font style but it might help create a more consistent color across the
    light weights.\r\n\r\nNice work on this. I'm amazed thinking of the amount of
    work that must go into this that you make look so easy with a few image posts
    on a forum."

  body: "Hi, Ryan-\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments. And I also had an issue with Kabel;
    it is very recognisable font, but those few things just weren't right to my eye.
    That's why I made my version.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the optical difference in height
    with light and heavy are of no concern; have you ever seen those weights been
    used next to each other? Basic rule with large families is to leave one weight
    in between for emphasis; so, for light, use medium as an highlight weight, and
    for book, use bold, and for medium use heavy.\r\n\r\nThat is why I've decided
    not to change the ratios of x-height and des- and ascenders."

  body: This is very nice looking indeed. But I have to agree on the x height thing,
    to my eyes, the two lighter weights now look slightly compressed. This might be
    a spacing thing, though. Perhaps everything will be fine if you give the thinner
    weights the space they deserve. Keep it up!

    is just a sample, but you see my point: x-height and as/descenders should be the
    same, when there's a chance they're used with each other. Adjusting the ratios
    would be difficult."
