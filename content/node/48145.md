  I am looking for which font is used on both the name AND number of this Argentina
  home football (soccer) jersey. I believe the name is an ITC Bauhaus variation and
  the number is similar to Pump Triline, but I do not know which exact font it is
  (for both). I need to find the font so I can use it on my soccer team's jerseys.
  Thanks!"
