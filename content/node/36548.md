    to set?"

    a good idea to check if your question hasn't already been answered previously.
    In this case, exploring Typophile using the Google search would've given you the
    thread he linked to. In that thread the Duvel logo has been dealt with.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want something similar to the actual neon sign though, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/linotype_auferstehung_virtual/\">Linotype
    Auferstehung</a>."
