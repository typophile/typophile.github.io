  I have the feeling I\u2019ve seen it before, but cannot seem to find it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/the-eyes-tx-upon-you_5066.jpg]"

    four different e:s, three different o's, lower case p seems small and uneven comparatively
    etc."

  body: "True, but many lettering specimens have been the source of fonts. I know
    that Nick Curtis, for example, sometimes made fonts based on the limited set of
    letters found on a luggage label, or something like that. Also, this looks like
    the sort of thing that showcard lettering artists would make. Quite often they
    had a full alphabet to use as a reference. So perhaps it is still possible that
    someone fonted this one. \r\nDon"

  body: At first I thought this looked familiar - and I searched all over at likely
    sources - but then I concluded that fonts like Lilith, inline Einhorn and a Japanese
    font called Candy all contributed to this feeling. After seeing the extreme differences
    in the two s's (and lesser differences Johan mentions), I highly suspect this
    is (very nice) artwork.

  body: The creator  was Creator Font, but the site link is dead now. The font itself,
    <a href='http://www.dafont.com/candy-bold.font' target='_blank'>Candy Bold</a>,
    is irrelevant outside my own graphic memory - and poorly made.

    indeed not a masterpiece. I suppose we can now say finis to this wannabe font?
