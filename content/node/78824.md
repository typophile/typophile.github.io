body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a font family that is a script with four different
  styles of the script plus a Pro version that will contain ALL the glyphs from the
  original four. One of the font versions of the family has more ROMAN style caps
  that can be used for ALL CAPS text. I now need to kern those CAPS in the Pro version
  to be identical to the kerning in the original font. In this situation, using KERNING
  CLASSES won't work, as the Roman style uppercase forms are so different from the
  original Script uppercase. \r\n\r\nThe PRO version of the script family will contain
  the ROMAN style glyphs as alternate characters (A.Roman B.Roman C.Roman, etc) .
  Rather than trying to manually duplicate the kerning pairs in question, I would
  like to be able to import the kerning of ONLY those characters from the Roman Style
  font into the PRO font (assigning the kerning to the alternate glyphs). \r\n\r\nIs
  what I wish to do (to avoid a whole lot of work and headache) even possible?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRob"

  body: "AFIK, if the Roman characters are named correctly in your .afm file, you
    can use the Import Metrics function in FontLab to add to current kerning pairs
    in the font.\r\n\r\nOne way (although probably not the easiset way) to accomplish
    this would be:\r\n<ul><li>export kerning from your Roman font</li>\r\n<li>open
    the .afm file in a simple text editor</li>\r\n<li>CUT the kerning pairs info and
    paste them into a new text file</li>\r\n<li>manually delete any cap/lowercase
    and lowercase/lowercase pairs</li>\r\n<li>search and replace A with A.Roman, etc.</li>\r\n<li>search
    and replace K.RomanP.RomanX.Roman with KPX</li>\r\n<li>CUT and paste back into
    original .afm and save</li>\r\n<li>import metrics into your new font with \"Add
    pairs\" option selected</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

    can be accomplished far more quickly in Excel, if one is moderately handy with
    it...
