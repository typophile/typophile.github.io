  body: "Quoted from an [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/16233/|old
    thread at MF]] about the same logo:\r\n<blockquote>Originally quoted from http://www.artofjamesbond.com/concept.htm\r\nThe
    \u2018007\u2019 logo was devised by Joseph Caroff and first appears on the US
    posters in the familiar format that uses the \u20187\u2019 to form the handle
    of a pistol. The UK posters used a variation of the old Pan Books logo and the
    Caroff version did not appear in Britain until it was used on the quad poster
    for On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service in 1969. Caroff\u2019s 007 logo quickly
    became one of the most instantly recognisable trademarks of the series and appeared
    in many variations in the campaigns that followed.</blockquote>\r\nSo apparently
    not a font but a custom woodmark. Anyway, you can reproduce it using [[http://www.dafont.com/007-goldeneye.font|007
    Golden Eye]] font by Filmhimmel."
