  body: "Hi - I'm not sure if anyone has replied to your message. The font used by
    McLaren appears to be a custom font based on Red Roosters Elstron Light font.
    Their version is extended by 160% and appears to be squared off more than the
    original. Certainly the lower case \"c\" is special because Elstron is a caps-only
    font. I would guess that an agency redrew the font for McLaren, or perhaps RR
    supplied a custom version.\r\nHope that this helps!\r\n"
