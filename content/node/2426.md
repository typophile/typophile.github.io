body: 'Article about &#34;Euroface&#34; at Mr. Bil&#39;ak&#39;s site: <BR> <BR>&#34;The
  research included continuing reevaluation of existing  <BR>type designs &#40;Helvetica,
  DIN Schriften, Universe etc.&#41; The  <BR>results are revealing. For instance:
  Helvetica failed in all the  <BR>laboratory tests, obtaining only 0.4 ISRU. Consequently,
  the  <BR>European Committee for Uniformity of Type Design and  <BR>Type Safety decided
  to abolish Helvetica for the 21 century  <BR>as absolutely non-functional and dangerous
  for the new <BR> generation. As we have emphasised, this total systems  <BR>viewpoint
  is necessary in order to avoid proliferating design  <BR>which, whilst independently
  effective for regional problems,  <BR>conflict with the current overall system.&#34;

  body: Why not make it necessary to obtain a license in order to use Helvetica? <BR>
    <BR>Sort of like a driver&#39;s license but granted on a per project basis to
    ensure it is not used gratuitously. <BR> <BR>just a joke.
