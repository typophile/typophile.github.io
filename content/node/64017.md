  conceived where the first stroke of the letter \"M\" would be thick? And of course,
  where the design would look good and legible, not just weird. Traditionally the
  M is, as far as i know, always constructed with thin stroke first, followed by thick
  one, then thin again, etc.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think this 'tradition' comes from baroque type design, as seen in typefaces
    like bodoni. These typefaces are based on geometry and drawing. Before that, the
    letters where based on the writing with a broad nipped pen. This means that both
    the 1st and the 4th stroke om the M have equal width.\r\n\r\nThat typeces which
    break your aforementioned tradition look weird to your eyes is in my view purely
    because we are not used to seeing them, not because they are illogical or counterintintuitive.
    That said: type design is a notoriously conservative discipline, so there might
    not be too many typefaces around that break these unwritten rules.\r\n\r\ngreetings

  body: "<cite>\"From the writing direction M\u2019s first stroke is thinner by nature.\"</cite>\r\nWell
    it's nice that we can overcome that \"nature\". :-)\r\n\r\nThere are a few low-contrast
    fonts that have thick \"outer\" and thinner \"inner\" strokes on the \"M\"; some
    Emigre fonts come to mind, like <a href=\"http://emigre.com/fontpage.php?SFaiWBol.html\">Fairplex</a>,
    <a href=\"http://emigre.com/fontpage.php?PTriSB.html\">Triplex Serif</a>, <a href=\"http://emigre.com/fontpage.php?SVisSLBlA.html\">Vista
    Slab</a>, or <a href=\"http://emigre.com/fontpage.php?PChoSlB.html\">Cholla Slab</a>.
    I've linked to the bold cuts because the contrast scheme is easier to see in them
    \u2013 it's not very strong, but the pattern is there.\r\nBTW, sometimes (but
    not always) these same fonts also have a nontraditional contrast scheme on the
    \"N\" (with the diagonal being lighter than the stems).\r\n\r\nFWIW, for sans
    look at Bell Gothic/Centennial. "

  body: Huh? The question (as I understood it) was for contrast patterns in "M"s.
    The *degree* of contrast, and the pattern that's employed, are two related-but-separate
    things in my book. But really, we should leave the question of what should count
    and what shouldn't to the original poster.

  body: I'm glad too see my question evoked some good conversation. The typefaces
    I'm looking for are indeed HI-contrast serifs, but where the first stroke is a
    thick one. The Emigre fonts mentioned are interesting, but the difference in contrast
    is too small to what I had in mind. Slab-serifs can actually get away with this
    quite easily, but where the contrast is higher, the convention is much harder
    to break.

    What\u2019s wrong about it? If your M is wide enough you can cope with the four

    to prevent you from not following this writing model. I think however that a consistent
