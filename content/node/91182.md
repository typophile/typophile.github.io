  \ There's probably thousands of \"distressed\" fonts by now, which I would think
  would fit in this catagory.  And they get fanicer than that too, like this one that
  has electricity inside it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/electrical.font\r\n\r\n
  or this one which has picures of skyscapers at night:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/urban-jungle.font\r\n\r\n
  what to call these things?"

  body: "Not figurative.\r\nThe Electrical font clearly belongs to the sans category,
    at first hand. \r\nAt second hand: the additional feature in this case I would
    adress as *a graphic modification*. As is e.g. shadowing or outline display.\r\nIn
    the established categorization schemes there is, unfortunately, no means to accomodate
    such aspects of fonts."

  body: "Panose doesn\u2019t appear to differentiate between figurative and non figurative
    fill.\r\n\r\nAlthough many patterns are representational, no pattern can be truly
    figurative, because nature does not repeat itself with such regularity.\r\n\r\nNow,
    with OpenType, the trick is to make the fill in repeated glyphs non-identical.
    Dunwich and CanadaType have produced such fonts, in the distressed mode, IIRC."

  body: "IMHO the Mol\xE9 Foliate is a decorated font where decorations are added
    to a letter with out savaging it's design.\r\nElectrical and it's ilk are a different
    kettle of fish. I might use terms like distressed, corroded, weathered, cracked,
    shattered, fragmented, split, exploded, demolished or damaged to describe them.
    They seem to have some use for titling movies about post-apocalyptic existence,
    drug cartel atrocities, war as an unpleasant experience, or tea time with ISIS
    or the Taliban.\r\nUnfortunately Panose classification does not differentiate
    between the added decorations that do not change the basic letterform, like Mol\xE9
    Foliate, and those that do. Panose as Procrustean bed...\r\nDon"
