		<div class="commentbody">Thanks a lot <BR> <BR>Maybe i need to explain a bit more now, i'm not really interested in books like 'the more fun magazines in the world' or things like that. I mean i'm not searching infos about magazines that don't look like magazines. I need infos on how to organise and design a serious magazine, and about the grids used. As as i said many of the books are only about book design, and its pretty different. There are some materials on how to make a newspaper, its bit more close i think, but not enough. But maybe there is a real lack in this area. <BR> <BR>Anyway thanks for the all the info provided, i didn't bought any books for now on the subject because i was not really impressed of what i seen online, but maybe i'm gonna try it now and spend some books (</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Surprise Me and Praxishandbuch Gestaltungsraster, both from Hermann Schmidt Verlag, are pretty good. Alas, they're of course written in German.  <BR> <BR>Brodovitch was a master &ndash; and the Fleckhaus book is marvelous, I agree&hellip; Gotta check out that Lois book. It's a shame that there is nothing about the work of Khan, which precludes Brodovitch.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Masthead (the mag about mags) isin't about what mags are hot&hellip;(well there is a back section about the upcomings) But really its an excellent resource for following and understanding trends, content, organization - lots of crits. For instance there was a big uproar in the magazine world about a certain issue of Flare that had a pinch of product placement on the cover (a big no no!) and that was discussed at lenght in Masthead. the 25/25 isin't the 25 prettiest either, its about what was truely innovative abotu certain spreads, articles, illios, editting stuff like that.  <BR> <BR>anywho - maybe its not as technical as you would like, but I don't think anyone should design by a how-to-book in any case.</div>
