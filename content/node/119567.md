body: "This is my first attempt at a typeface which isn't based on a grid or systems
  based approach. I'm very much a beginner at typeface design but looking to improve
  as quickly as possible so please criticise as much as you feel like. \r\n\r\nThe
  typeface is tentatively named Solzhenitsyn after the book with the lettering that
  it is based off. The lettering in question should be below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font2_5222-2_6393.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  loved the caps on the title and wanted to try to create a full alphabet from this.
  My first very rough drafts are below and a pdf is attached for a closer look. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/folio_6348.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_4280.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
  quick all caps print test.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/folio4_4729.jpg]\r\n\r\nBeing
  pretty new to the actual design of typefaces I'm unsure if this is a good start
  or if there are a multitude of errors hidden away within what I've done. I'm also
  now wondering if I want to create a faithful replication of the title or modernise
  and try to make it more relevant to today?\r\n\r\nEither way please wade in and
  criticise. Any feedback would be incredible and most helpful!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMax"

  body: "Personally, I see that as a feature. It is not usual to see the tittle height
    overshoot the ascender height, but precisely that is what adds character to the
    font.\r\n\r\nI love the subtlety in which this is still a semi-serif. Nice starting
    point.\r\n\r\nAre you sure this doesn't already exist as a font? (did you post
    it in the type ID section?)\r\n\r\nI will come back soon to give you proper feedback."

    in /bdgpq/ the curved thick of the bowl looks lighter than the straight stem\r\n-
    thin pointy top of  /t/ doesn't mesh with the relatively blunt terminals elsewhere\r\n-
    shortness of ascenders may be too extreme for a typeface (what works with the
    particular letters on the book cover won't necessarily be generalizable metrics).
    \r\n- more space in the counters of /MNW/ would be useful\r\n- /X/ looks heavy
    and wide\r\n- /CG/ tops seem too thick\r\n- maybe the little pinches at the tops
    of the caps should be more subtly done\r\n- spine of /s/ is too dark\r\n- waist
    of /P/ should probably be lower\r\n"

  body: "I\u2019m back! A few comments:\r\n- In agreement with Craig's comment, /MNW/
    are too dark. The left vertical stems should be thinner, at least near the diagonal.
    In your sample the vertical stems don\u2019t vary in contrast, whereas in the
    book cover there is a tapering towards the diagonal, which gives the glyph more
    energy and lightens things up a bit. \r\n- That pointy ended top of the stem of
    /a/ doesn\u2019t really work IMO.\r\n- The modulation of the bowls of /adbpq/
    is not as soft as in /CGce/. I would take those as reference.\r\n- The crossbar
    of /f/ could have the same height as /t/.\r\n- The crossbars of /ft/ are too pointy.\r\n-
    /L/ looks too narrow to me. I think the width in the book sample was adjusted
    to compensate for the gap of the /LZ/ pair.\r\n- The terminal of /jgyJ/ is also
    too pointy. A more rounded terminal would fit the style of the typeface better.\r\n-
    /Jj/ are too wide, especially /J/.\r\n- /T/ is too narrow.\r\n- The top right
    serif of /Y/ is too pronounced.\r\n- /z/ looks great!\r\n- Soften the bottom of
    the left diagonal of /y/ at the bottom corner.\r\n\r\nNext time you could set
    a few alignment zones so that your image samples don\u2019t look so different
    from the PDF samples ;-)"

    \u2013 In answer to your question, I did yes. It was posted a good while ago in
    the font ID section, although all the comments pertaining to it seem to have since
    disappeared for some reason. No ID was reached, the closest match being Laudatio.
    \r\n\r\nIt doesn't show well in the jpeg but the stub serifs seem to vary slightly
    between the same letters and the Z in Zurich and Solzhenitsyn are quite different
    which led me to believe it was a piece of custom lettering rather than a typeface.
    The book is a 1976 edition."

  body: "Just managed to work my through the rest of the feedback ha. All of which
    is helpful. \r\n\r\nBoth of you seem to say it'd be better to ease off on the
    slightly pointy nature of it so far, that being the top of the t, the jgyJ terminals
    or the crossbars. That was probably me trying to force something which didn't
    quite fit into it..  \r\n\r\nDo you think that by raising the crossbar of the
    f I would have to raise the terminal and probably the ascender height as well?
    Which would probably feed into the position of the i dot as well.\r\n\r\nAnd did
    you mean to take the bowls of the 'CGce' as a reference?\r\n\r\nSorry about the
    sample images... Alignment zones will be learned and used for when I've reworked
    it. I'll try and make some of these changes in the next day or two.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    then we\u2019ll see. Sounds all like coherent decisions, but you\u2019re looking
    too far into the future ;-)\r\n\r\nLooking at it for the second time, I agree
    the ascenders may be <em>a tad</em> too short and Bob\u2019s suggestion may be
    worth giving a try.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And did you mean to take the bowls of the
    'CGce' as a reference?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nUh, yes. I didn\u2019t realize I was
    being vague. Try keeping the smoothness of the bowls of /CGce/, especially at
    the bottom where it approaches the stem (it will of course bend more than in those
    reference characters, but I think you can still reflect its \"speed\" of thinning)."
