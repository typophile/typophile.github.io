body: "This is from D. B. Updike's \"Printing Types\", vol. 2, pp. 186-187: it is
  a page from \"a poem folio entitled 'The Sovereign. Addressed to His Imperial Majesty
  Paul, Emperour of all the Russias', by Charles Small Pybus, London, [Thomas?] Bensley,
  1800\", described by Updike as \"a superb showing of transitional Enghlish types
  just *about* to become modern face\". It seems to me a very interesting - and rarely
  seen - example of a way to approach a post-Baskerville typeface: an early Nineteenth
  century modern type which doesn't look like nor Bodoni/Didot, neither the Modern/Scotch
  types. I don't recall having seen a similar typeface in Nineteenth century specimens,
  other than here; and I wonder if someone can point to some other printing references
  for it.\r\n\r\nBelow is the full 300 dpi sample attached.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/updike_bensley01_5116.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/updike_bensley01bis_5361.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/updike_bensley02_6265.jpg]"

  body: "I went to Updike to check that, indeed, the typeface is not named in this
    instance.\r\n\r\nStill, it does look oddly familiar: it reminds me of the faces
    of W. A. Dwiggins, such as Caledonia, which are classed as Modern and yet are
    clearly far more graceful than the usual Scotch Roman typefaces."

    in my opinion this face seems to have much in common with Caledonia, Fairfield,
    Electra, and the other W. A. Dwiggins faces."
