  was a one-day symposium about type and typography in Brno, Czech Republic (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/69564\">announcement
  on Typophile</a>). The event that took place two weeks ago in the Brno House of
  Arts was organized by <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/7019\">David B\u0159ezina</a>
  and some of his students.\r\n\r\nFor those who couldn\u2019t make it to Brno, there
  are several write-ups online now:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?p=1102\">Dan
  Reynolds @ typeoff.de</a> [English]\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typejockeys.com/blog/TypeTalks-2010-in-Brno\">Michael
  Hochleitner @ typejockeys.com</a> [English]\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.de/2010/06/typetalks-brno-1/\">Florian
  Hardwig @ MyFonts.de, part 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.de/2010/07/typetalks-brno-2/\">part
  2</a> [German, but with lots of pictures. You can try Google Translate to get the
  basic idea: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/9d81Yh\">part 1</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/bJS9Fn\">part
  2</a>]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are a few photos up on Flickr, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/typetalks/\">tagged
