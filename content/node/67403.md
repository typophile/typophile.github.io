  suggested trackings in Helvetica? \r\n\r\nI do notice that Heavy Heavy does like
  a least of -10 to -25 tracking but Helvetica Light does not work that well on the
  same profile.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample. \r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1SDTojoQxz1oPXdTSbMJt6QUPIIRu1\r\n\r\nby
  the way, here helvetica light has 0 tracking.\r\n\r\nMaybe is my InDesign screen
  but Helvetica Light with -10 track look too cramped.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nS\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is a built in DNA to every typeface that suggests the optimum spacing.
    By looking at the counter space (negative) in the letters and the thickness of
    the strokes (positive) you create a rhythm of positive and negative patterns.
    Space between words & lines should help balance that rhythm. Bold faces generally
    should be set tighter to retain their density and lighter faces should be set
    further apart to ensure their lightness.\r\nHelvetica has an almost perfect figure/ground
    relationship (balance of positive/negative space) so it's hard to screw it up.\r\nThe
    Telus ads tight track the Helvetica ultra light which is counter intuitive.\r\nIt
    should be very loose to enhance that lightness.\r\nBut, now that it is a familiar
    part of our vernacular, we accept it - like \"all justified\" newspaper columns.
    This doesn't mean it is right, just that, like bad grammar, it's acceptable.\r\nWe
    too readily accept the familiar as good or appropriate.\r\nTypography is like
    music and as Massimo Vignelli said, \"it's the space between the letters that
    count\"\r\nMusical notes are only defined if there is a pause so that you can
    absorb the note or notes of a sequence.\r\nIn typogragraphy the space between
    the strokes of the letterforms, between the words, between the lines and paragraphs
    define that rhythm.\r\nThat's what we aim for.\r\nThe average reader has about
    3 seconds to determine if they are going to pay any attention to what you have
    set. Our goal as designers is to bring them in, hook them and keep them involved
    from start to finish.\r\nWe are in the information distribution business.\r\nComfort
    is the key. \r\nWhen you jar a reader from their reverie by changing rhythms,
    forms, or structures you can move them away from the intended focus - or worse
    lose them entirely.\r\nMost designers don't understand this and design for the
    purpose of display rather than for imparting the information to the reader - which
    is our ultimate goal.\r\nThis is all subjective.\r\nRead a slew of books and you'll
    find theories as to why you should set everything tight or loose regardless of
    the letterforms.\r\nAdrian Frutiger, when building towards his Univers (and with
    many typefaces under his belt) remarked that, in terms of type design, he had
    come to the realization that every stroke he put on the page in forming the characters
    had less to do with designing the typeface and letterforms than it had to do with
    removing the negative (white) space of the page and that that ws his revelation
    in balance.\r\nTracking, as a whole is an ill used tool. Kerning is much more
    important in terms of getting the letter shapes to relate to each other. AFTER
    you have kerned your text appropriately, then the tracking adds an openness or
    tightness to your text.\r\nUltimately, it's all about rhythm.\r\nPositive/Negative
    & balance between them.\r\nI hope this helps. \r\n "

  body: "What I meant by \xABwhat kind of setting\xBB was primarily: text or display?\r\nWhen
    you set some large titles, or maybe a logo, you can take all sorts of liberties,
    also with tracking, to make the type look good. When you set longer/smaller text
    to be read however, readability has to take precedence over looks. Simply stated,
    track a font too tight and you risk making it harder / less comfortable to read
    (as the white space between the letters matters for reading). Lastly, it also
    depends on point size: The smaller your setting, the looser the tracking has to
    be in order to be comfortable.\r\n\r\nNow, obviously Helvetica (like any font)
    comes with a \xABbuilt-in\xBB \xABrecommended\xBB tracking. (That's why I asked
    \u2013 recommended by whom?) I assume the thought that it \xABhas to\xBB be tracked
    in comes from the trend (which has been around since the 1970s) that states it
    looks better when it's tighter; but it's really not very functional. Especially
    because Helvetica already is rather on the tight side for text settings.\r\n\r\nDo
    look at the pattern of whites. Maybe even more importantly, if you're setting
    text, print out variants, and read them, and see what doesn't only look good,
    but also <em>feels</em> good. :-)"

  body: "Hi Altaira, thanks for the good insight on the Helvetica. I will be using
    the Helvetica Light as text and Helvetica Heavy as tittle. It is interesting to
    know about the trend in the 70s to use Helvetica with very tight kerning. I have
    checked some very nice Annual Reports by BMW using Helvetica, and they use a kerning
    that goes somehow -25 for the Helveticas Heavy.\r\n\r\nI also watched a tight
    kerning in the movie poster for the film \u201CHelvetica\u201D\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the good feedback,\r\n\r\nSebastian"
