body: "I'm working on a complete rebranding and was given the task of coming up with
  type options for the client. The key words associated with the brand are 'Real'
  'Determined' 'Down To Earth' 'Strong' and it's a sports affiliated brand. Right
  now they're using a rather boring squarish sans. What I'm looking to do is give
  them suggestions on a Display typeface and a Body copy/legal complimentary sans
  with multiple weights (regular, light, bold & italic). I'm definitely looking for
  a fresh/new typeface for the display setting, something that isn't widely used/overused.\r\n\r\nI've
  not had a whole lot of free time to spend on here recently and as such don't feel
  like I have my finger on the pulse of what's going on typographically/foundry-wise
  these days. This is where your help comes in! :o)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions of typefaces
  or where to find info on recent releases that might be relevant would be great!"

  body: "Great! Thanks for the ideas and suggestions about keeping myself in the loop,
    Stephen! I don't think as far as a matching pair that I need two variations of
    the same design, but I do like the heavier weights of Prelo Slab.\r\n\r\nFeeltheKern:
    Union looks great and has tons of weights/faces which could be well utilized.\r\n\r\nAny
    other thoughts?"

    is similar to Prelo. A bit more techy, perhaps.
