  body: "Perhaps different weights of Drescher Grotesk\r\n---start quote---\r\nLife
    was frugal for designers (and everyone else) in the GDR. Typeface licenses were
    very expensive and with little money available to pay for them, type designers
    were instead ordered to design their own version by state publication authorities.
    Drescher Grotesk, originally designed by Arno Drescher around 1932 and redrawn
    by Karl-Heinz Lange as Super Grotesk at VEB Typoart (the state-owned type foundry),
    was the East German response to Futura. \r\n---end quote---\r\nSource:\r\nhttp://wwnorton.tumblr.com/post/37262931239/fonts-and-the-valley-of-unknowing\r\nDigital
