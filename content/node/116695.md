  my gut enough to post here. I need some critique on both the form and kerning of
  this typeface. I create this for my final year project and inspired by some Postrock-ish
  band.\r\nlooking forward to your opinion, thanks a bunch!\r\n"

  body: "Looks quite original!\r\n\r\nThe rhythm strikes me as quite uneven. Try out
    some narrower versions of /A and /V, and fix the overly large space between /ID.
    Maybe reduce the spacing in general? \r\n\r\nDon't worry about kerning until you've
    got good base spacing. Use a font editor that makes spacing and kerning easy,
    such as Glyphs.\r\n\r\nTry punching a hole into the /V to make it less black,
    like you did for /A."
