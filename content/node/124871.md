    for [[http://www.gargalo.es|Gargalo]]. Looks like some sort of heavier and more
    contrasted version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-no-20|Modern
    No.20]]. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern|Scotch Modern]] Display
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller-banner|Miller Banner]] are
    also interesting but not matching either.
