		<div class="commentbody">I think Dav has the answer. The typeface in question is kinda ho-hum and would probably go unnoticed save for the marketing mind that made it go topless. My joke was actually a veiled way of saying the same thing.  I was equating typographic times with the normal fare of marketing prevalent today. Der Spiegel Magazine for years has made me laugh with its proclivity for putting what I call &ldquo;Babe Glitz&rdquo; on the cover. Imagine if Time Magazine would do the same here in the States.
You must admit, MyFonts made you look! Would you have given that font a second glance otherwise?

<p>Chris, the typeface in question is a design classic, by the unforgettable Roger Excoffon. I remember its being featured in <em>Caractère Noël 1958</em>. The release of Calypso by Fonderie Olive produced quite a sir in the typographic community. That typeface was as hot as the <a href="http://www.calypsoworld.org/us/us-belafonte-2.htm">LP</a> with the songs it was apparently inspired by, and named after (I am sure you remember those tunes). Of course, it all looks different from 2005&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Anybody remember the old display font &ldquo;Body&rdquo;? The letterforms were made out of silhouettes of the human body in various contorted forms. The cap M was very sweet - two figures in profile facing each other and holding hands. But the N, on the other hand, showed one figure holding the genitals of another. Can&rsquo;t find the font (a search for body is useless) probably never digitized. It was in some huge honking ringbinder/specimen book we had in the 80s.</div>

<p>Do we? I mean, I&rsquo;ve never thought about using this kind of advertising either, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say that font-shopping is a universal thing. You need a credit card to buy fonts. How may kids have their own credit cards? (somehow, I&rsquo;m afraid of the answer here…)</p>
<p>And moreover, even if there are &ldquo;kids&rdquo; in the audience, meaning 13–17 year olds, is it really that bad if they see some partial frontal expose? I mean, they are on the internet and all… it isn&rsquo;t like the real porn isn&rsquo;t hidden away somewhere where they&rsquo;ll never find it.</p>
<p>I doubt that real children (i.e.,the PG crowd, who do deserve protection) are shopping for anything online, much less fonts.</p>
<p>Chris: <em>“Babe Glitz&quot;</em>
In Europe, the best selling newspapers are mostly tabloids. I can&rsquo;t speak for the rest of Europe, but Germany&rsquo;s #1 tabloid (<a href="http://www.bild.de">www.bild.de</a>) has a topless girl on the cover (albeit below the fold) five days a week. Don&rsquo;t tell me the PG crowd, or even the G crowd, never sees a paper purchased by 5% of the population daily.</p>

<p>I must have missed that one Maxim.  Perhaps it is just my personal feeling about that font. Lets just say that I would never buy it no matter what position it held in the minds of others. It reminds me of those awful faux Chinese faces that were used a while ago to indicate something of Asian origin. 
My type knowledge must be lacking as well since I never heard of Mr. Excoffin or have seen this font before today. That is what I get for being self taught :-)</p>

The prominence of the halftone was a device used in the &rsquo;60s by artists Roy Lichstenstein and Richard Hamilton, among others. Chris is right, the letterforms are a bit cheesy, but that&rsquo;s also pop art territory. The outrageous formal invention is all Excoffon.</div>

<p>Calypso is also a very modernist font. Curved surfaces, &ldquo;streamlined&rdquo; shapes, ovals, eggs, etc. are very typical modernist design features. Think of: Saarinen, Courrèges, Noguchi, Moore, Expo ’58 in Brussels, Möbius Strip, and&hellip; oh, Barbarella.</p>

I see what you mean about the German tabloid Bild!</p>

<p>The Calypso thing is nothing compared to Bild! Is that thing just sitting on the news stand out there like all the other newspapers?
Even our lovely &ldquo;National Enquirer&rdquo; keeps the cover fairly tame if you don&rsquo;t mind the odd &ldquo;Kentucky Women Gives Birth to a Jeep Cherokee&rdquo; kind of headlines :-)</p>

<p>ps. Stereotypes are rooted in truth. Because it&rsquo;s a stereotype makes it offensive? As much as I don&rsquo;t care for the lack of class on their part, why not associate it with &lsquo;the islands&rsquo;? . Hey I got it, lets put a fat white guy behind a desk scratching his armpits. That will carry a better message! I just don&rsquo;t get it ! She&rsquo;s not being shown in a negative light at all! If there were dark skinned people dancing there, would you say the same thing. Lets not associate hawaii with volcanoes, OK? Certain people here might not like that, because they are the self-righteous defenders of the under-represented!

<p>Of course! <em>Bild</em> is Germany&rsquo;s #1 newspaper, in terms of sales at least. I&rsquo;m sure your daughter&rsquo;d remember seeing it practically on every street corner, although Munich has its own popular tabloid that might take away some of Bild&rsquo;s market share there. I should note that Germany does have serious, quality papers, too, which usually don&rsquo;t resort to such sales tactics. Every country has an array of quality when it comes to newspapers. I suspect that this is quite true in the UK as well.</p>

<p>Indeed, as a Canadian I am well aware that we are silly people, with our love of hockey, curling, maple syrup, and The Tragically Hip. (The best rock band in the universe, in case you didn&rsquo;t know.)</p>
<p>My problem is that these rum ads are obviously made by an American ad agency, and there is nothing redeeming about their portrayal of black Caribbeans. The actors in the ads may as well be in blackface makeup for all of the subtlety of the racism.</p>
<p>And yes, I do find ads featuring stereotypical images of Inuit to be inappropriate too. And any other commercial message supposedly delivered by a representative member of a ethnic or national group. Why do we need to perpetuate stereotypes? That&rsquo;s exactly how stereotypes are strenghened and passed down from one generation to the next. A television commercial or a 100-pixel square type specimen is both the symptom and the disease.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know I&rsquo;m taking this way too seriously, and I&rsquo;m probably coming across as a liberal Canadian assh*le, but something like the &ldquo;Calypso&rdquo; image shows such huge disregard and lack of sensitivity that it&rsquo;s stunning. Would URW sell one of their blackletter types with an image of Hitler?</p>

<p>Likewise, what is the stereotype in the Calypso illustration? That in many Carribean countries, the majority of people are black? Isn&rsquo;t this just fact? Having a white woman there would be like a Quebec tourism ad with English-speakers, when we are only 10% of the province&rsquo;s population and only 25% of Montreal&rsquo;s (even if we&rsquo;re a majority in Westmount).</p>
<p>Selling a blackletter font with an image of Hitler would be bad because Hitler was evil and killed people. However, if it were to be marketed with images of steins, lederhosen, and sauerkraut - things which are typically german - it might be cheesy, but not racist.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which brand you are talking about, but most of them are based in the countries where their product is produced. Anyway, whatever the owners' race or nationality, I wonder why the only way to feature any minority on television is for the portrayal to be &ldquo;redeeming&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Let me make a literary connection here. The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. Is it a book about a greedy jew, or a greedy man of the jewish faith? Anyone who claims that Duddy Kravitz is an anti-semitic story is wrong. Instead, they are projecting their own prejudices and stereotypes onto the story. Nowhere is it implied that Duddy is greedy because he&rsquo;s jewish (I doubt Mordecai Richler, a jew himself, would be a very big anti-semite), and nowhere is Duddy&rsquo;s faith ever connected in any way to his character. Rather, those who claim that it&rsquo;s so have made the connection themselves, either through internalized racism or some other hidden prejudice.</p>
<p>In the same way, it is <cite>you</cite> who have made the connection between the negative portrayal of <cite>people who happen to be black</cite> and the fact that they are black, when in fact the creator probably had no such connection in mind, but rather was trying to tap into a cheesy image like the one of Curling and Canadians or Lederhosen and Austrians/Germans.</p>
<p>It is people like you (and I promise you that I am in no way trying to be insulting or accusative when I say this, but merely pointing out an observation) who propagate these stereotypes by insisting that any greedy person on tv or in a book who happens to also be jewish is greedy <cite>because</cite> he&rsquo;s jewish, or that any black person on tv or in a book who falls into some other stereotype does so <cite>because</cite> he is black.</p>

I think it&rsquo;s more a matter of exploitation than placing the appropriate race on the appropriate package. Calypso = ambiguously Carribean = topless black woman = cheap thrills. What is the relationship of power between an impoverished black woman (I&rsquo;m assuming poverty because why else would someone subject themselves to sexual humiliation?) living on an island whose main industry is tourism, and a relatively wealthy white male(I&rsquo;m assuming white because most of the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen from type conferences are full of crackers) tourist? I&rsquo;m starting to sound vaguely feminist, and I don&rsquo;t even know anything about feminist theory. Nor do I want to.</p>

<p>Ahem.The Inuit have never been the major group in the Klondike and there are very few of them living anywhere in the Yukon and, as far as I am aware, there are no longer any specifically Inuit settlements. The Canadian Inuit are concentrated in the other northern territories, and only in Nunavut are they the sole significant aboriginal population.</p>
<p>In the Yukon, aboriginal groups account for less than 15% of the current population, and almost all of them are indian, not Inuit, most being speakers of one or other of the Athapaskan or Tlingit family of languages. The indian band located in the Klondike region are Han, an Athapaskan group. They are ethnically and linguistically unrelated to Inuit.</p>

<p>This may of course be related to the fact that we have a 19-month-old baby, and that the two families we are closest to also have children of breast-feeding age.</p>
<p>All that being said, I am not saying that I would create such an ad, and in fact if we had such an ad in the works, I would probably object on the grounds that it it&rsquo;s going to offend some people, and isn&rsquo;t all <em>that</em> clever, and the argument that it&rsquo;s sexual objectification is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, would we be talking about a 50-year-old font at this much length if they hadn&rsquo;t done the ad? I guess it worked&hellip;.</p>

<p>That advertising constantly uses sex to sell doesn&rsquo;t make it either in good taste or ethical. &ldquo;Sins repeated seem permitted.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I generally like sexy women in ads&ndash;ok, I REALLY like sexy women in ads&ndash;but The problem I have with this image is that it is not only sexy, but degrading to the woman. The two are not the same. It is an unmistakable soft-porn image, as Joe Pemberton notes above. Would you want your daughter to grow up to pose like this for the public? As Chris Rock said in his recent comedy routine mentioning his baby daughter, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you are, if your daughter ends up on the [stripper&rsquo;s] pole, you f****d up! If you&rsquo;re a daddy, your job is: Keep her off the pole!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What chester is uncomfortable about I suspect is only indirectly a racial issue. Because the picture is degrading to the woman, it indirectly raises the question of whether the photographer and advertiser think it&rsquo;s somehow ok if the woman is black and poor.</p>
<p>I am amused that so many here seem to be so scared of being called a prude that they can&rsquo;t say the obvious, which is that this is in bad taste because it is degrading to the woman.</p>

Yes, the ad is in bad taste, but bad taste can sometimes be funny, as someone who quotes Chris Rock comedy routines must acknowledge. In this case, I continue to find the juxtaposition of this font and this bad taste and in so many ways objectionable image funny. I wonder, was it meant to be funny? These little square ads are provided to MyFonts by the foundries, and I wonder whether MyFonts has policies about their content?</p>
<p>In many ways I find this kind of blatant soft porn image less offensive than much of the sexualised advertising I see &ndash; or used to see when I lived in a city &ndash;, even if the latter did not usually involve &lsquo;nudity&rsquo;. At least this woman looks like a woman, however augmented, and not a fifteen year-old seeking social approval through sexualised fashion and body language.</p>

<p>Yes, &lsquo;Ali G&rsquo; is a genius at stupidity and bad taste and he is hilarious, especially his character &lsquo;Borat&rsquo;. But if this particular ad is an attempt at humor it seems to me a pretty lame one. If anyone can make ads for type sexy or funny or both without being gross I am all for it. This one is gross and lame.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe it is just a first try. Maybe there are many more and better to follow!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I was in my mid-teens I traveled with a school group to a Inuit community in the Northwest Terriories, (now in Nunavut.) When we found out that &ldquo;eskimo&rdquo; means &ldquo;one who eats raw meat&rdquo;, we asked one of our hosts how he felt about being called eskimo. He said, &ldquo;Well, we do eat raw meat. Be I prefer &lsquo;Inuit&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just reiterate here that my objection isn&rsquo;t to the bared breasts, but to the source of the advertising: A German foundry. As a Canadian I am allowed to make fun of my hockey- and curling-loving countrymen, myself included (Go Habs!) and I appreciate the &ldquo;I am Canadian&rdquo; ad campaign because it was made by Canadians. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the rum ads — for Captain Morgan&rsquo;s Parrot Bay brand — were created by a U.S. ad agency for U.S. consumption.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re discussing the ad in depth, here&rsquo;s more of a formal critique.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Inadequate product demonstration. It&rsquo;s a missed opportunity to show how the tonal detail of the font is achieved: the ad square is the one place at Myfonts where there&rsquo;s space to show detail &ndash; so it would have been good to show this sexy feature of the font up close, by putting one large glyph in the position presently occupied by the alphabet showing. So the viewer can get a better sense of the halftone scale in relation to the type height.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistent use of colour. The all-white type is a bit too flat and cold for the saturated background and image. Some yellow would have been better, a big yellow C perhaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rhetorical mismatch of image and text. The image does not symbolize product features: She&rsquo;s not dancing; the calypso is a dance, and the typeface dances &ndash; but the woman is in a static pose.</p>

<p>You’re absolutely right. Sorry about that. What I meant to say was that they are the group most people associate with the Klondike. That says more about most people not caring enough about the Klondike to study its racial makeup and less about their racial insesitivity. Anyway they use a polar bear now…</p>

<p>Fine, but what exactly is the myth or stereotype in showing a black woman in relation to a product associated with the Carribean? If the font was called Amsterdam and the woman was white, would you still be outraged? If so, then you are probably more concerned with the objectification of women (understandable) than racism. If not, then I ask you why an image of a topless black woman is racist when that of a topless white woman is not. Who decides that? You? Why does the black woman deserve more protection from objectification than the white woman? Is the hypothetical topless white woman not worthy of your outrage? Are white people somehow inferior to black people, that they may be objectified without guilt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>I didn’t notice the ethnic origin of the model in the Calypso banner at first. It was only because I was trying to figure out what started the racist claims that I went back to myfonts.com and noticed. </cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Just for the record, the first time I saw this thread, I hardly batted an eyelash at the fact that the woman was topless, and I didn’t notice her race until it was pointed out. I spent about 15 seconds on the page and then got bored…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>If that picture makes you think of sex blame your own brain</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very well put. That’s exactly what I meant too. Also, if that picture makes you think of racism, blame your own brain.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah, count on Typophilers to do it right. Richard Hards' image of the black woman with the curly hair is great&ndash;and her zig-zag pose matches the type, and Richard both handles the color well and frames it well, unlike the original ad. It is actually a good ad for the typeface. The woman has an independent air, seems to be from the 60&rsquo;s like the typeface, and is sexy without being gross. She makes the type look sexy.</p>
<p>[edit: Would it be still better if she were transformed by a mirror image, so she is looking at the type? Or too obvious?]</p>
<p>Vincent Connair&rsquo;s second image, with the two men and the Fractur, is hilarious.</p>
<p>The issue of appropropiate use of sexual allure in art and advertising is actually quite a complex one. The original example that Paul Hunt points out is just bad, not least because the graphic design is bungled, as Nick Shinn has pointed out.</p>

<p>I like it, too. But Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch would be more appropriate with that image. That looks so 1920s Nationalistic to me, right up Koch&rsquo;s ally.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;sche Fraktur is a digitization of the Luther&rsquo;sche Geißerei&rsquo;s type, from the late 1600s. That&rsquo;d look better smacked on the bottom of a monument to a king, a duke, or a Saint—something baroque instead of 20th Century.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s tacky pap, but I think the racism is secondary to the generally exploitative nature of the photo, which is only so strong because it seems so out of place and the photo is so obviously pushing banal pop-culture softcore instead of tasteful sensuality or eroticism. The person responsible seems to be confusing the origins of the Calypso dance with the <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/c/calypso.html">Greek sea nymph</a>. Sounds like ignorance unintentionally giving birth to racism, which is all too common.</p>
<p>But, seriously, it&rsquo;s more stupid than anything. When has the name of a font been a good reason to choose it? How often does the name give you such a literal indication of its design properties? They don&rsquo;t show a picture of Chicago by the font of the same name. It&rsquo;s just cheap and lame. Perhaps Mrs. Eaves should have a racy pic as well? There&rsquo;d be more reason for it. As someone else pointed out, Calypso the font has nothing to do with naked women, let alone naked women of potentially Carribean descent.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a question: did MyFonts actually go out of their way to license/pay for a topless photo for this particular font?</p>
<p>EDIT: In my own ignorance, I failed to check if the Calypso was, in fact, a dance. It&rsquo;s not. So, to prevent further error, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_music">Here&rsquo;s some info on the Trinidadian Afro-Caribbean music</a>.</p>

<p>I should add as well that it was suggested, in a different thread, that Requiem (HTF) might be popular among religious publishers precisely because of its name.</p>

I recall the design as a youth and I also feel that the name Calypso was more a reference to the Greek nymph in mythology as he named other of his type designs Diana and Mistral.</p>
<p>His Mistral and Antique Olive were widely popular (and I&rsquo;ve used them many times up until the late seventies).</p>

I was being way too kind (actually snide) when I said Calypso was &ldquo;ho-hum&rdquo;. Read further down where I said:
&ldquo;For me personally, the ad sucks and the font sucks—a match made in “—-” (fill in the blank for location from New York or Montreal to Montego Bay).
$19.95 buys this font, a Ginsu Knife, “the Greatest hits” of any second rate singer, or a “Clapper”. Spend wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also replied later:
&ldquo;Yes Tiff, they do have their place, as long as it is not at my place.&rdquo;
My straight-from-the-shoulder opinion just for you Hrant is that Calypso is a piece of crap (and I don&rsquo;t care who designed it). The &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor with the screen 3D thing is way over rated&ndash;kinda like putting a drop shadow swoosh around a logo today. It was no big deal to do for the technology then. Every newspaper had ads using that same technique in their bargain basement cheap junk section.</p>

<p>I assumed that it was hand drawn.  Everything else was hand drawn then too, it was no big deal. I am an old geezer myself and have hand drawn things throughout most of my career. There is a big difference between being hand drawn and being good. Every designer had a drop-bow compass for drawing lots of small circles quickly.  Those dot progressions would have been a piece of cake in those days.  Today, younger designers probably wouldn&rsquo;t know where to start because they have never seen it before.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think even the publishers of TIME would call it a world news magazine. I have not read it in years so I can&rsquo;t say if that is still the case. TIME is more concerned with their advertisers openmindedness than that of the general populace. The only way magazines have a prayer of making money is through their print ads. Der Spiegel covers are obviously just a newstand attention grabber and don&rsquo;t reflect the content of the magazine.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks to Nick Sherman for bringing this thread to my attention.</p>
<p>I have seen very early marketing materials for Calypso and I&rsquo;m surprised nobody else mentioned the fact that a nude or semi-nude Caribbean female has always, for some unexplained reason, been used along with the type specimen. I&rsquo;m not sure if Calypso music shares some historical affinity with nudity, so I don&rsquo;t know why that connection exists, but it does. It could just be an Excoffon thing, though; an early Mistral type specimen also uses photographic breasts as a marketing device. I&rsquo;m not sure how much input the designer had as to those specimens, though&hellip;</p>
<p>Calypso was first released in 1958 and the specimens I saw were produced in the very early 1960s. At that point, from what I understand - I was not yet on the scene - urban French culture was especially enamored of West Indian culture and women from the French colonies in that area were in high demand as fashion models in France and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, anyone who believes a photograph of a nude woman&rsquo;s torso is pornographic is not only reactionary but ridiculous (and, apparently, has never actually seen real pornography). Invest in a dictionary.</p>

<p>Joshua, a bare breasted beautiful young woman in a sexually provocative pose fits the definition of soft porn, which is what I said the image is. See the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_porn|definition of soft porn in the Wikipedia]], which the picture fits very well. You can hold that there&rsquo;s no problem with soft porn or you can say it&rsquo;s not appropriate for this advertisment, but the fact is that picture does fit the definition.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I had a question about the racism comment above.</p>
<p>Why would it be a racist image just because she&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>Using the same logic, if she were white, wouldn&rsquo;t it also be racist just because she were white?</p>
<p>The only thing I see in that image is a girl with no shirt.  I don&rsquo;t want to unsettle the whole art vs. porn thing, but I don&rsquo;t see any sex act taking place, it&rsquo;s simply nudity, not pornography.</p>
<p>One might argue the appropriateness of an image like that on a site free for children to browse, but I think here in North America we have hidden and covered ourselves so long that now we have weird fetishes like topless women.  I don&rsquo;t see how that simple image <em>should</em> evoke such a response or controversy.</p>
<p>I say, the artist thought the image was beautiful, and also thought it evoked a feeling complimentary to the typeface.  The ultimate goal of the typeface is to sell it.  The artist is also appealing to North American audiences, as well as global.  The artist chose an image that got people talking about it, got awareness raised and ultimately, got an ancient font fresh in the minds of people.</p>
<p>Debate whether it should be there or not, but I haven&rsquo;t seen anybody else point out any other Font previews recently.  The artist did their job well in this case I&rsquo;d say.</p>
