body: "While trying to find the name of the antiquarian bookseller that was in our
  vendor area at TypeCon04 in San Francsico, I went to ever-helpful google and typed
  the keywords, \"san francisco antiquarian books typography type specimens\". One
  of the hits came back from the <a href=\"http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/catalogues.php?catnr=2266&membernr=1608\">ABAA
  (Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America)</a> and I suddenly found myself
  thinking about my checking account. Sheesh! Temptation at this hour is not such
  a good thing.\r\n\r\nIf anyone <em>does</em> happen to remember the name of the
  bookseller, please tell me as I'm really struggling to remember."
