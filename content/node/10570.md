  of Portsmouth. Being in the last year of the BA program, I have elected &#34;City
  Typography&#34; to be the subject of my final major project. <BR> <BR>I plan to
  create a magazine featuring the typography of a specific city in every issue. The
  first issue should be about typography in London and - of course - the people behind.  <BR>In
  this context, one article should be about the personal impressions of city typography
  of designers and typographers in London. &#40;It&#39;s really just one article of
  the hole magazine and I&#39;ve done much other articles already. Just in case, you
  don&#39;t think that I want you to do my work!&#41; <BR> <BR>This topic is the reason
  for my mail. <BR>If you like my idea and want to help me to get through it, please

    I started a thread on dyslexia and typography, wondered if you knew anything on
    the subject? I am willing to help you with your project, sounds interesting, would
    be a good side project for me right now... Where would you like me to send stuff
    to you?'

  body: Inga, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m slightly confused about your project, could you clarify
    please? Are you researching the historical relevance of vernacular typography
    of London or specifically the perception of it from other designers? Are you looking
    for designs inspired by local traditions, practices, etc?  <BR>I apologize for
    all the questions. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
