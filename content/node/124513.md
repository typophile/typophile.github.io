  body: "Not finding any exact matches to the type on this French Canadian/Quebecoise
    poster, because it appears to be all hand-drawn (repeating letters don\u2019t
    match).  I suspect it was drawn by the same duo who did the illustration, Dupuy
    and Berberian:\r\nhttp://www.duber.net/index1.htm\r\n\r\nHowever, you could employ
    similar digital typefaces to mimic the look.\r\n\r\n|Une Com\xE9die Qu\xE9becoise
