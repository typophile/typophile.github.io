  body: You&#39;re looking at <a href="http://www.typequarry.com/type.html?sku=026"
    target="_blank">Broadsheet</a> from The Type Quarry  <BR>&#40;AKA Three Islands
    Press&#41;. They are one of the few <BR>foundries left that haven&#39;t signed
    on to MyFonts. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s a pretty nice antiqued roman. Thanks
    for <BR>reminding me about it.

  body: wow, thanks a lot, stephen! &#40;for the id and for visiting my site&#41;
    <BR> <BR>the sample was taken from an <a href="http://www.amex.com/dia/" target="_blank">
    Amex ad</a> i first saw on New Yorker magazine. <BR>actually, the ad isn&#39;t
    so nice but this font is beautiful...
