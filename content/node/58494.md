  I am responsible for getting Universal Type Server ready to deploy by August 1st.
  For the last 5-6 years we were using Font Reserve and I was not involved in type
  administration at that point. Extensis came here last winter and did a massive font
  migration for us from the original font vault server for Font Reserve to a new server
  for UTS. What I now have is about 10,000 fonts to sort through of which about 2500
  came out as damaged or PS orphans. I started going through the list recently and
  found most of that content should never have been there. It turns out that Font
  Reserve was set up so that whenever any of the 600+ mac users added their own fonts
  to the personal folder FR dumped these automatically into the font vault. Hence,
  there are 1000's of freeware fonts and various cheap or unlicensed fonts to sort
  through. \r\n\r\nSo\u2026 my question is\u2026\u2026\u2026 if anybody knows if UTS
  does this auto upload thing as well and if so is there a way to stop it?"

    may use a specific font, which users may not use certain fonts, etc. You can also
    set the preferences so that users may not add any fonts; if you don\u2019t do
    that, they will be added to the server."
