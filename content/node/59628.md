body: "I'm looking for audio clips of thoughts, insights, stories, pet peeves, etc
  for an online radio show I co-host called [[http://rbtl.us|Read Between the Leading]].
  Generally we record conversations and interviews with type and graphic designers
  (previously on the show we've had Mark Simonson, John Boardley, Stephen Coles, Armin
  Vit, Aaron Draplin, Nick Sherman, Jason Santa Maria, and more), but we want to try
  a show of short \"design thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nIf you've got something to share, there
  are a few ways you can get us your audio clip:\r\n1) You can call us and leave a
  messsage: 646-402-5686 extension 20248\r\n2) You can record it on your computer
  with Garageband, Audacity, some audio program and email it to readbetweentheleading@gmail.com\r\n3)
  If you've got an iPhone, you can record a voice memo and email the memo to readbetweentheleading@gmail.com\r\n\r\nIf
  you've got anything type or design related you'd like to get off your chest, please
  get it to us, we'd love to hear it. If you have absolutely no way to record audio,
  email us some text and we can probably find a way to slip it in at the end of the
  show.\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance. I know Typophile is filled with talented
  designers, so I'd love to hear what everyone has to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
