    It's rather hard to see the details of this sample, but [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/garagefonts/freight_sans_pro_black_ot/?&sample_text=Skandia&update=0|Freight
    Sans Black]] looks pretty close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    on 'humanist sans-serif' and looking for families with a large number of weights.\r\n\r\n-
