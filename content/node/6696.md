body: Hi everybody, <BR>my sister asked me to design a logo for her new company, selling
  fashionable clothes for women during pregnancy.  she chose the name, so i can&#39;t
  change that, and i have to work with the hyphen, because if it were just cooture
  &#40;and not coo-ture&#41;, it would look wrong.  &#40;it&#39;s supposed to play
  off couture, but with the word &#34;coo,&#34; like baby talk&#41; <BR> <BR>anyway,
  i&#39;m having trouble with it. if you have any suggestions, i would really appreciate
  it. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49049.gif" alt="two

  body: I like the first one. The second one , though smart, is a bit obvious. Is
    there a reason for the color aqua-green? I like the sans serif treatment but can
    you use a different kind of sans serif, it looks a bit editorial to me. But that&#39;s
    my opinion. work with it some more. <BR> <BR>IM

    clothes for pregnant women <i>who also happen to be graphic designers</i>, you

    Loren, as you might already know there&#39;s an outfit called Japanese Weekend

  body: The hyphen/female symbol is interesting, though your solution is unbalanced.
    What if you simply made the t a plus sign and kerned it flush to the o. That way
    you get the hyphen &#40;sort of&#41; and the symbol. <BR> <BR>Alternatively, you
    could shift the baseline on the word ture enough so the crossbar froms the plus
    on the o. The shifted baseline would give the word distinction, but wouldn&#39;t
    be too unbalanced. <BR> <BR>I think the second idea is the better of the two.
    <BR> <BR>Good luck!

    <BR>thanks for you suggestions. i&#39;ve reworked the logotype a little, in two
    ways.  i can see that it doesn&#39;t have a logo-like look, it&#39;s just letters...
    but i think that it doesn&#39;t need any special &#39;hook&#39;.  i think it should
    remain very simple, no icons or graphics or whatever.  does anyone agree with
    that? <BR> <BR>as for color, i&#39;ve left it gray for now. maybe the gray &#40;or
    black&#41; will be the color. i definitely don&#39;t want a baby blue or pink.  any
    suggestions?

  body: concept is strong with bottom image, but somehow is feels to cryptic &#40;for

    are right with the <b>r</b> and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve experimented a little
    bit with what you might call a monolinear version &#40;for starters, I turned
    the <b>t</b> upside down which didn&#39;t look totally bad, but required some
    additional work that I didn&#39;t invest&#41;. A cap <b>R</b> might really look
    good. <BR> <BR>I also tried several modifications of the <b>e</b>, but sticked

  body: thanks for your suggestions everybody... i have simplified the logotype.  i
    figure the product can speak for itself.  the logo/logotype will be stitched on
    the tags on the clothing.  i think the icon can be used sometimes without the
    word, and vice-versa.  please let me know what you think of this new direction.
    <BR> <BR>there is a hyphen for one of them, and dots for the others; which is
    better? <BR> <BR>as for colors, they can change, but these are some experiments.  i
    still think gray could be fine, especially for tags on clothes; you don&#39;t
    need anything to distracting.  but for other materials, some lively fun colors
    would help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49977.gif"

  body: i dont know if you all noticed this at all, but i was sensing a weird interaction
    between the cross of the female symbol and the t in coo-ture.  so i softened the

  body: I like it, although the cross seems a little beefier than the &#34;C&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Would it be too much to create some association between the cross in
    the mark and the &#34;t&#34; in cooture? Maybe when cooture is seen alone, the
    &#34;t&#34; can take on the softened nature? I dunno

  body: I like the logo, however you might consider adding a serif face which might
    bring  a sense of warmth to the identity. What appears to be Avante Guarde feels
    a little cold for a womens wear line.
