  making in my neighborhood. I would like to be able to use the pretty well known
  signs around town on street posts as my base for my wine share image but I cannot
  figure out the font. I looked through my fontbook on my mac and on google web fonts
  but was unable to see or I missed it so I thought I would try here. \r\n\r\nFrom
  what I understand the signs were made awhile ago and I cannot seem to find who made
  them or anyone in the community council that knows either. Thank you for your help
  and time!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCF0011_3637.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCF0010_5863.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/BelltownNeedle_4212.jpeg]"
