  a sans serif font inspired by the skeleton of some fancy display font from the early
  XXth century (1910's). I am allowed to that kind of adaptation ?"

    suffer from too much detailing; a \"clean\" version of them would be good.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    what you have in mind is quite alright, the only thing to be careful with is proprietary
    names."

  body: That is what I tought. What I have in mind is is a little bit like redrawing
    a sans serif of the garamond (for example). Same structure different shapes.
