  has an idea what typeface it is in the logo. My first thought is it's slim and flat
  version of neo sans/tech, but not sure. Or is it a custom font? Thanks in advance.
  BTW, I didn't try whatthefont.\r\n\r\nPS: it's the logo for the International Horticulture
  Exposition 2011 Xi'an (where I am in), but it's not a good news for us.That's another
  story."
