    spoils a movie for me like seeing a four-foot-tall prime symbol up there on the
    screen.

  body: "I for one am glad that Optical Kerning is not on by default in whatever program
    created this title.\r\nSo that\u2019s why plain old Georgia (no kerning) looks
    like this.\r\nInterestingly, the Segoe Script setting uses contextual alternates,
    presumably on by default.\r\n\r\nOne should be more concerned that the designer
    chose such mundane bundled fonts, which expresses a certain disdain for the subject
    matter, even if such dependence on bundled fonts were occasioned by ignorance
    of more sophisticated alternatives."

    Long tail on the \"e\" and \"n\"  shouldn't happen if the features are applied.\r\n\r\nSi"

    the Cornish word for Cornwall is Kernow. Being a proud Cornishman myself I chuckled
    to myself about that but didn't mention it here, thought it might be a bit esoteric
    for general discussion but I regret it now! \r\n\r\nHow appropriate though. Kern-now! "

  body: "While the examples are bad, especially the first one, you have to realize
    that most people do not see things the way typographers do. Because we are tasked
    with eliminating bad kerning, our eyes immediately spot the problem. To others,
    there is no problem (unless they are the minority that read a space instead of
    the bad kern).\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to find out how many non-typographer/designers
    can spot the problem with these samples. I suspect most of them will look for
    spelling and/or grammar errors, and totally ignore the typography. Ask your partner
    (if they are not in the field), and see if my theory holds water."

    most listeners might not be able to detect a wrong note, but that\u2019s not the
    issue.\r\n\r\nIf designers addressed every aspect of their work on a similar basis,
    then there really would be a problem. So it\u2019s better to never let your guard
    down.\r\n\r\nAs for spelling, people will read what they expect, but that\u2019s
    no excuse for incorrect spelling, even though it may go unnoticed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ept_sports_nhl_experts-721453150-1233844914_6155_4789.jpg]"

  body: But I doubt these are mistakes made by designers. Because the titling is part
    of the editing software package, they are being done by video editors, hence the
    typopgraphic errors and unimaginative use of free system fonts.

    think we all understand that. The concern is that PEOPLE SETTING THE TYPE should

    very much are the graphic designers. Just really crappy ones. "
