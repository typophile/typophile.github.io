  body: "I spent some time looking for this yesterday and some of Zapf's fonts like
    Chancery and Zapfino are a little similar, but there's no way to know if this
    isn't a custom hand-drawn letter. I searched on calligraphy and chancery and didn't
    see an identical Z.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
