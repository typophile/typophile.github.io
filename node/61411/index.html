		<div class="commentbody">The course is about designing type. The approach is agnostic. Drawing, font editors or illustration applications are the students choice. I encourage students to use FontLab Studio 5, and last semester most did. But some chose to do the work in Adobe Illustrator and some chose to draw with paper and pencil.

Without using a font editor, the course essentially becomes "Alphabet Design", but ultimately it is about drawing letters and "system design".

It avoids the excesses of 34th Street to the North and 14th Street to the South but yet has the same number of traffic lanes. :)
You'd think, to preserve the mathematical balance, 24th street would be the boulevard, not 23rd.

I once taught a class on migrating networks when MS Windows 2000 Server first came out, not far away but on the west side.
Because of the prep I had to do, I ended up learning more than the guys I was teaching, by far.

When I've taught my own course at ArtCenter (14 weeks, 3 hours per week) I've personally expected no such thing. My own ambition has been to simply reveal to my students how scary it is! Some of them can handle it, but I don't think it makes sense for anybody who tries to succeed, at anything really; but even the ones who will never try again at least develop an appreciation for the ones that will (and do).

		<div class="commentbody">When I taught undergraduate type design I always expected the students to finish their typeface in the allotted time (15 weeks 2:40 per session). One weight, full character set (western european latin) with one OpenType feature. I explained to them that a professional would do the work in about 200 hours, so they should allot at least twice that much during the course of the semester.

I made it clear at the beginning of the course that if they didn't finish, they would fail the course. Without that pressure they had no incentive to work hard on their projects. 

Did they make good type? Hardly. Some of them came close, most were obvious first attempts. But they were exposed to the process, they learned how truly difficult making type was, and they all had a deep sense of accomplishment when they used their newly finished font to design a poster showing it off. Most told me it was the best design course they ever took.

Continuing Ed is a different environment, but I still expect the commitment to finish what one starts.</div>

You set the bar high, and see who can get over it. If no one can, you can always lower it a bit for a particular student or class. But if you set the bar too low to start, you've cheated all of those students.</div>

You would be surprised at the tools we have now. For instance, you and I can be connected (along with 12 or more other students) and if you are teaching I will be able to see your computer as you draw a character in FontLab, while listening to you explain what you are doing. I can't see how that would be more difficult than in a classroom.

In fact, with the software, if I have FontLab, you (as the instructor) can see my FontLab screen as I try to do an exercise, and you will quickly see where I am going wrong on some task I have misinterpreted.

I firmly believe type design is an ideal subject for online learning, because the numbers of people who are interested in learning from an expert are generally scattered in many different locations. Only those living in the megopolises get to take courses like this one otherwise.</div>

True, although -like you said- there's a big difference between a
required course and an "adult" class: in the former it's difficult
to have too-low expectations...  :-/

> I firmly believe type design is an ideal subject for online learning

Indeed.
One software I've used to great effect with 30+ students (not for type
design however) is NetSupport*. It's not cheap, but it can do almost
anything, including transmitting audio, allowing remote supervision
and even taking control of a user's computer (yes, scary... for them :-).

I’m pretty sure that online learning is the foundation of type design instruction for many people. The problem is that it hits a wall at the Typophile crit thread. Screencasting and sending PDFs proofs of design around would be a huge plus in learning type design for people not near cities with type designers.</div>

In this context finish means, complete character set drawn (WIndows 1252/MacRoman) properly spaced and kerned and with one OT feature (usually ligatures, but some students have done small caps or some sort of contextual alternate). And a poster or some other piece of collateral that shows that the font  functions.

The semester finished last week, most everyone in the class got pretty far along in their type designs. A lot of good stuff!

I'm teaching this course again for the Spring semester on Tuesday nights. You can check out the course details [[http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/ceCourseFinder/app?sDay=0&sTime=0&sLoc=&sDept=&sCourse=&sInstructor=montalbano&sKeyword=|Here]].</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd like to share mine. I could use some more feedback. Though I'd like to think that someday I too might release something commercially, this particular design is nowhere near ready for that (on the less-far-along end of the class completedness spectrum). The caps are mostly awful and my curves need lots of work and lots of other things need work, but I'd quite appreciate any thoughts or suggestions or encouragement (and actually discouragement if it's appropriate).

So I tentatively present: Retro Upright III (working title), a playful upright cursive connecting script. <a href="http://www.gillographic.com/uprightsample.pdf">pdf specimen</a>
