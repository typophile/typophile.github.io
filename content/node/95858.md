  body: As the feature is common to the examples on your list, all being in the Old
    English vein, it finally occurs to me to wonder about the dealie in the capitals
    consisting of an extraneous vertical hairline connected to the letter proper by
    two little hairlines bowed toward each other. It is purely decorative and weirdly
    structural at the same time. How did it come about? Does it have a name? I never
    questioned it before, but now, upon examination, I can't see the sense of it.
    If anyone has any clues to the history of this curious artifact, I would like
    to hear them.

      the ribbing of Cathedral Church stained glass windows....

  body: '@cerulean I presumed it was to give balance to the overall tone of the letter.
    The big open forms have a lot of negative space without those lovely little hairlines.'

    seen called a \"whiteletter.\"\r\n\r\nIt's funny how blackletter types are called
    \"Old English.\" Old English \u2014 as in the language, Anglo-Saxon \u2014 was
    not written in anything like a textura style, but in something closer to a half-uncial
    style. English was not written or printed in blackletter until the Middle English
    period (c.f. Caxton's Chaucer)."
