  block fonts:\r\n\r\nThe first is the headline for Oui Magazine.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oui_4061.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  second is probably a newer font made in the style of a handmade font:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Collection_3800.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kamm_4357.jpg]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!\r\n\r\nDavid"
