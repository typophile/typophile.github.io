  body: "Probably not a font as such.\r\nThe _R_ with the leg reaching to the top
    of the vertical stroke a new cliche in the category of experimental sans. Here
    it is in a font mentioned in a previous thread [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ExperimentalSansTypophile94310_5573.jpg]
    http://typophile.com/node/94310\r\nAnd here is a page critical of the experimental
    sans genre http://experimentalsans.tumblr.com/\r\nAll of the letters in the logo
    can be made by modifying something like Core Sans G R 55 Medium\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CoreSansGR55MediumAsORIGINALS_4465.gif]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/s-core/core-sans-g/\r\nDon"
