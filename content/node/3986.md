  body: Lubalin was an anti-establishment activist, pro-sex &#40;EROS magazine&#41;,
    anti-war. <BR>His counterparts in the UK signed the original First Things First
    manifesto, in 1964. <BR>Gerald Holtom was a WW2 conscientious objector who designed
    the CND logo &#40;peace symbol&#41; in the late 50s <BR>The &#34;tight but not
    touching&#34; style of display typography was a phenomenon on both sides of the
    pond in the 60s; Lubalin was its main main in the US. In the UK, not so readily
    identified with one person.  <BR>But it was also about the &#34;gridularity&#34;
    of the layout, and you can see that in the design and layout of FTF v.1

  body: Lynn -- By all means do a googlesearch on the work of Judy Kensley McKie,
    who is one of the best furniture designers and artisans the USA has ever produced.
    As for Lubalin his work was overly promoted in the design and typophile press,
    some of which was very good and some -- such as this example -- well, not so good.
    As for Nick&#39;s &#34;tight but not touching,&#34; we used to call examples of
    it &#34;kiss fit&#34; and joked that it came about because so many immigrants
    in New York, to whom English was a foreign language, were the ones composing copy
    on Staromats in subterranean darkrooms.

  body: 'Mark -- It&#39;s a judgment, not a rule book call. Personally, I find it
    -- for want of a better term -- a five-minute solution: stack a lot of type and
    don&#39;t try to work out an image beyond that. You don&#39;t get better copy
    than No More War and I think it deserves more than old wood type reminiscent of
    the Civil War, not Vietnam. Graphic design is not arithmetic where 2 &#43; 2 always
    equals 4. That&#39;s why we can have fun challenging solutions and learn at the
    same time. Good luck with your studies.'

  body: 'I must disagree Paul: What&#39;s interesting about this old wood type is
    the way that Lubalin has taken the hairline space that appears between serifs
    within letters -- most obviously the W of War -- and repeated it between letters,
    and vertically between lines. So this layout has some substance. <BR> <BR>&#40;This
    is a feature that we find today in Font Bureau&#39;s Giza, and House Gothic, and
    these fonts are designed with the appropriate sidebars to make the effect.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Secondly, this is a poster for an Avant Garde magazine competition, and
    its branding is spot on, as it is designed in the &#34;Ultimate Lubalin&#34; packed
    and stacked style of that magazine. <BR> <BR>Thirdly, this is an ad for a competition
    for anti-war posters, so Lubalin has wisely chosen not to make it an anti-war
    poster -- by confining himself to typography he has left the field of image and
    concept open to entrants&#39; imaginations. <BR> <BR>Come on Lynn, put your thinking
    cap on, get your magnifying glass out, and tell us what your observations and
    opinions are -- don&#39;t let the old guys do all your work for you!'

  body: I also have to disagree with you Paul. The design in question is far from
    being a &#34;five-minute solution&#34; &#40;even if it did take Herb five minutes&#41;.
    There is a lot more substance to the poster that what meets the eye. Firstly the
    ad/poster should be viewed in color, to fully appreciate it.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/32695.jpg"
    alt="nomorewar"> <BR> <BR>The layout is mimicking the American flag, with a black
    exclamation point at the end. For all its subtlety it is a very strong message.  <BR>
    <BR>I agree with Nick that this was entirely in keeping with the Avant Garde magazine
    style, but I also think that the concept is present. Purely by emphasising the
    title of the competition, and by using the flag as the reference point Lubalin
    cleverly turned a call-for-entries poster into an anti-war poster.  <BR> <BR>For

  body: It looks better in color, but what does our flag have to do with No More War?
    And why display type reminiscent of the early and mid-19th century? As I said,
    it&#39;s a judgment call. I think it needs a stronger image. A faux flag does
    not say No More War to me. On the contrary.

    ... this should help you find those images. You might also see if your library
    has past issues of U&amp;lc, this magazine had images of his work on and off over
    the years. I can&#39;t think of the search engine, but at your library as well
    there should be a way to search periodicals. Look for PRINT, GRAPHIS, U&amp;lc,
