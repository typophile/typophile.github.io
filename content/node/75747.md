body: I keep coming across these flourishes but can't seem to find where they originated.
  I assumed they were Dover clip art since they have a vintage or antique look, but
  cannot find them in any of their ornament books. Perhaps these flourishes are a
  font... Does anyone know where these specific ornaments are from?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flourish_5412.jpg]
