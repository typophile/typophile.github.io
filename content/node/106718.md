  body: "As Nick says it's probably a private font. However it's very similar to Officina
    Display Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/officina-display-itc/ developed
    by Erik Spiekermann for for the Economist Magazine and later offered for sale
    to the general public. Tinker with Officina Display Black by rounding some corners
    and adding some more mini flare serifs and most people would not spot the difference.\r\nDon"
