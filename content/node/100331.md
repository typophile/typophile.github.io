    & deforming <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Adobe&ffam=Kepler%20Std%20-%20Medium%20Condensed%20Display&fid=169b85c5996573a64a09fb8b95c66df4&fsize=60&text=PURPLE.FR&fit=1|Kepler

  body: 'Agree with previous comments, don''t think it''s a font as it. Top half part
    of the base serif has been kept and half bottom has been stretched (really obvious
    on /U). The key point is the P with its slightly falling bowl. '

    that shows a few more glyphs]], possibly a custom font for the magazine?
