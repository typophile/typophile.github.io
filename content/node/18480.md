body: "I wonder how it is possible for a bitmap font to have underscore appear as
  negative when it is crossing descenders. An example of this would be <a href=\"http://www.group94.com\"
  target=\"_blank\">Group 94</a> website (click on other news items to see ones that
  have links with descenders).\r\nLinks in the right column text appear with negative
  underscore, which makes descenders more visible. Can this be achieved within a TTF
  file itself or takes some trickery, like custom underscored font replacing the regular
  one after text is loaded?"

  body: "Pretty nice observation Magneto...\r\n\r\nI just emailed them the wonder
    of yours, as i'm also impressed with the underscore they use in a pixel font.
    (needless to say that i'm impressed of their flash development all these years).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen
    / if i get an answer from them, i'll post it here...\r\n\r\n\r\nNick"

      Adam...\r\n\r\n\r\ndo you use a CRT with a very high resolution? or an LCD in
      a resolution other than its native?\r\n\r\nWhen ever you can try to see the
      site with an LCD and in its native resolution...\r\n\r\nI think after that the

    is just annoying. Why do people do that?

  body: "It's not an \"underline\" font.  Watch carefully as the animation finishes
    - the text as animated and finished has no underline.  When the text has finished
    moving, the Flash animation just goes back and draws a line underneath the text
    they want, probably in XOR transfer mode so that white pixels turn black and black
    pixels turn white.\r\n\r\nIt only looks this way because none of the descenders
    (\"y\", \"g\") ever curve back up from their lowest point.  If they did, you'd
    see those little curls above the line, which is why real glyph-rendering systems
    don't draw undelines that way."

    body: I think drawing underlines would be a hell of a task. XOR pixel-toggle overlay
      over type.. I doubt it's even doable in Flash. My guess is they load the html
      text with one css style and after it's there they change the css into one that
      uses underlined version of the font on the <strong>a</strong> tag. But I'm curious
      if this is really the way they do it..

      body: The joke's on me. I just took a look at a site made by myself with my
        own pixel font and it invert-underscores just like G94's. It's just the way
        Flash writes underscore in html text.
