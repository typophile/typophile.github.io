  ran a story today on a school in Horten, Norway exchanging regular books for e-books
  in a test project. Apparently it's quite economical too, since production and sales
  costs are cut. The students are complaining it's still a bit slow, and that the
  books the use aren't designed for screen.

  body: Production costs will be cut, but that is usually only 5% of the cost of a
    textbook. If they are saying sales costs are eliminated, then that is only for
    the initial period. When every publisher has ebooks, they will be paying salespeople
    to flog them again.
