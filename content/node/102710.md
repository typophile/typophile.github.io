  Critics, i would like to ask for inputs once more. In the last post i have shown
  you the typeface alpha and i was already writing about making a bold. Now i have
  adjusted the regular some more and i have created the bold typeface. Therefore i
  would like to hear what you think about my former work, so i can polish it.\r\nbest
  regards"

  body: "Looking very nice now!  Much improved, I think.  The bold looks especially
    good, in fact.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% convinced by the new straight-horizontal crossbar
    on the /a ... it possibly looks a bit out of place given that every single other
    part of the character is based on quite emphatic curves.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I notice
    that the /e's eye is extremely large.  (I'm not saying that's necessarily bad,
    just that it kind of jumps out.  If that's the effect you want, then great.)\r\n\r\n/b,
    /d, /p, /q could maybe benefit from a bit more subtle narrowing of the bowl where
    it joins the stem, I think you've got a bit of congestion there.  Also, I have
    a vague thought that these characters might be a trifle narrow.\r\n\r\nLove the
    capitals.  I like the overall effect of the whole face, actually."

  body: "@ altsan:\r\nI am so glad to hear from you and i am happy you like most of
    my latest improvements. The straight horizontal /a is an adjustment i made when
    i started to see that the upper aperture of the letter in bold was way too small
    and not open enough to grant a good readability. So instead of making the curves
    just smaller i adjusted until i ended up straight-horizontal and i started to
    like it because the back of the letter is now mostly straight-vertical.\r\n\r\nThe
    /e could do with a little less feeding especially the regular one. And the widening
    of the joints in the /b /d /p /q of the bold is definitely worth a try. The width
    suits my feeling, but i could give that adjusment a try also.\r\n\r\nMay be you\u2019ve
    seen the fault, that the /\xFF and the /\u1EF3 in the regular are still looking
    like on the first time i\u2019ve uploaded the typeface. I managed to upload the
    image and then seeing and changing it, so the next upload would be rid of that
    mishap.\r\n\r\nI will await some more feedbacks before i upload another version,
    in order to minimize the server space i take up with this thread. Thank you so
    much for this encouraging input.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://brennmichnicht.com/index.html\">my former website <strong>in german</strong></a>\r\n\r\nThere
    is however a problem i\u2019ve come across in cross-browser display. Auto hinting
    is to be avoided i am aware of that, but i work on a mac with typetool 3.1 and
    the mac is hinting everything itself anyway, so i don\u2019t know how to adjust
    my auto hints and actually see the result. It\u2019s pretty annoying not to be
    able to make hints that work for both plattforms using just one of them. Does
    anybody know a workaround that does not include spending hilarious amounts of
    money?\r\n\r\nbest regards"

  body: I'm no expert but this sample is much improved. The results are very pleasing.
    You might tweak some of the width of the lower case glyphs. The /z and /w for
    instance still seem a hair wide. Another minor item is that the dollar sign seems
    too strong next to the numbers. I would like to see the @ and & next to some of
    the letter glyphs. Check you side bearings on the Oslash. You might wish to include
    the Sharp S which is at uni1E9E. Just a suggestion, I've had to do a few signs
    were that glyph was required. No, I don't speak or read German so making signs
    in German is tricky. You kinda have to hope that the client is paying attention.

  body: "@phrostbyte: Thanks again, this helps a lot. If i recall correctly the sharp
    S should be around the third last line in the beginning. I am from switzerland,
    so i know a bit of how tricky german signs can be (of course swiss people always
    have to have their own special ways to typeset things, but hey it wouldn\u2019t
    be fun if it was easy would it? hehe).\r\n\r\nIn Fact the feedbacks on this forum
    have been more helpful, than most of the lessons by my former teachers. I am working
    right now on an italic that i will upload as well with a more substancial type
    test and i intend to upload vector pdfs again so i can save a little server space.
    Hopefully i will be done somewhen soon.\r\n\r\nbest regards"

    goal is to market your final product? If so, you might consider expanding your
    language support. It can be a huge can of worms.

  body: "I think this is very well formed. It could use a little more balance in the
    lines. Specifically, try to think of ways to make the /r or /t interrupt the rhythm
    less. (The /r adds a gap, the /t makes things a little too dark.) From there you
    can look at the rest of the characters in that light, and also scrutinize your
    spacing.\r\n\r\nEverything for the most part looks fine by itself and side-by-side.
    Where I think you could use a little work is fine-tuning the rhythm and color.
    :-)\r\n\r\nKeep it up!"
