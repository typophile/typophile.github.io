<p>There&rsquo;s also light coverage in Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s <em>Elements of Typographical Style</em>.</p>
<p>Bringhurst&rsquo;s is not as in-depth as the former, but easier to find. For the Tschichold one, find a good library. I actually talked the library at SUNY New Paltz into aquiring one while I was a student there. I know of a link to the text of the specific chapter that I&rsquo;m referring to, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it would be outside of the typophile rules so I won&rsquo;t be posting it. I can imagine that making such content available is against copyright regulations, even if the book is out of print.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get some great recommendations from others as well, these are just two that I&rsquo;ve read myself.</p>

<p>1.618, the golden mean.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there are any analytical treatises on this in type design.
However, I just did some measurements on the cap and lower case &ldquo;O&rdquo; in Adobe Garamond, and the relationship between the height of the two is golden, within 1%.</p>
<p>Claude Garamond would most certainly have used this ratio, but did he calculate it? Probably not, IMHO, as if you&rsquo;re living in a culture where everything of merit follows those proportions, they would be second nature.</p>

<p>the cap and lower case “O” in Adobe Garamond</p>

<p>One of the difficulties in thinking about &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; proportions is that you can compare the h-ascender to the x-height, the overshoot heights of the O and o, the h ascender to the o overshoot height. So if one of the ratios hits &lsquo;golden&rsquo; exactly,the others won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So in the end, as I suppose Nick would agree, you just have to look and see what you find pleasing in the given design.</p>
<p>You get a similar issues with text and page blocks.</p>

<p>Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica Neue have modern proportions while Frutiger and Futura have <strong>oldstyle proportions</strong>. (paraphrased)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garalde typefaces have flowing forms, medium to high contrast and variable widths (the capital letters hae wide and narrow <strong>oldstyle proportions</strong>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Didone style exaggerates key features of the earlier Transitionals: letters are drawn with vertical stress, uniform widths (<strong>modern proportions</strong>) and extreme contrast.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Duncan. The explanatory diagram you are searching for does exist (it&rsquo;s just that at the moment it&rsquo;s in my office on a bookshelf and I can&rsquo;t remember which book it&rsquo;s in&hellip;)</p>
<p>Someone else on typophile is likely to give you an improvement on what I set out here, but briefly; it&rsquo;s all about the respective widths of key characters in the uppercase.</p>
<p>Classic proportions for typeface designs are those based on Roman inscriptional lettering (eg. <a href="http://www.linotype.com/8565/trajanregular-font.html">Trajan</a>)where the uppercase O is oval, the M is slightly wider than the square of its height, and the uppercase N is approximately half of this M width. The &lsquo;narrow&rsquo; letters of the uppercase alphabet E,F,L and S etc. all follow the width of the N.</p>
<p>The renaissance designers followed this model for proportion in their various Oldstyle/Garalde designs. The proportions were overhauled and rationalised about three centuries later with the arrival of the Modern/Didone proportions in which uppercase O is circular (wider than its predecessors), M is narrower and N is square – having a significant roll-on effect on the proportions of the rest of the uppercase (E,F,L and S all becoming much wider). Its effect was to regularise the widths of the letters.</p>
<p>In sans serif designs, the early (19thc) grotesques (eg. <a href="http://www.linotype.com/13428/monotypegrotesqueroman-font.html">Monotype Grotesque</a>) often vestigally followed Oldstyle proportions, while the later 20thc rationalisations of this style – the neo grotesques (eg. Helvetica, Univers <em>at al</em>) were drawn up to modern proportions.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Futura (which has alledgedly perfectly circular uppercase O) is known for being based on classic Roman proportions – and therefore cannot be referred to as a grotesque in the English-speaking world.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The proportions of the classic Roman capitals fall into groups. My memory fails me but generally, I believe it is that there are groupings that most letters fall into (but there was always optical compensation). There were the circular letters or O group. Circular is not meant exactly, much compensation was made. While the D, C, and G, were in the group with the O and Q, they were actually a stroke width narrower (as becomes quite obvious when drawing them). The middle width was the N, H, A, V, and T (later U). The so-called half-width group was the, S, R, P, E, and F&ndash;keep in mind that they were neither exactly half nor exactly the same width as the eye was the final arbiter. The wide letter M and W were wider than O but not twice as wide as N. Overlapping two Vs a bit gives you the W and a V with arms gave you the M. Again, this is not micrometer exact measurement. Just as we today optically adjust, so did they&ndash;I wonder what the Roman word for overshoot was :-) The capitals I and J were clearly odd balls and pieced from the strokes and partial curves of the rest. The Trajan column letters are not exactly the same width even with the repeated letters. You must admit that those old codgers did one hell of a fine job anyway though!
The classical proportions (being clear groups of widths) are more often used to describe the difference between early times and more modern times when the width of letters became closer to the same optical width. Modern letters are still not perfect measures since this would make for some ugly type. Even the Bauhaus could not make the crazy things exactly geometrically and god knows they tried.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While I was reading Chris' post I started to realize that the books that I have read and have been reading do explain these proportions, after all. I probably lost the connection due to my reading in small chunks when I can find the time. Really this is why I hope to either find or create some sort of chart that explains these concepts. That way I could refer back to it and have all the information in one place.</p>
<p>So far I understand:</p>
<p>That the groupings are general and that optical adjustments by the designers mean that there are/were not so hard and fast that for example one could say, &ldquo;In all Classic proportioned typefaces the O is a perfect circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Classic Type Proportions generally fall into set groups of widths that are more or less designed around a square.</p>
<p>Modern Type Proportions are generally designed around a similar optical width.</p>
<p>The best books I have read so far that have helped my understanding on these styles and proportions are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/sr=8-1/qid=1171899789/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-0796813-5734315?ie=UTF8&s=books">Designing Type</a>
by Karen Cheng</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/sr=1-1/qid=1171900026/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0796813-5734315?ie=UTF8&s=books">Elements of Typographic Style</a>
by Robert Bringhurst</p>
<p>I am really interested in David Hamuel&rsquo;s suggestion of &ldquo;A Constructed Roman Alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I realize that no great typeface rigorously follows hard lines of geometry I still keep coming back to the ideas of how geometry and type design interact.</p>

<p>Because no letter in a great typeface strictly follows simple geometrical shapes, such as circles and squares, I think there is more likely something to be learned from the Fibbonacci series, from ovals and spirals, and so on.</p>

I&rsquo;ve no idea where it is – I may even have been referring to something I saw in Karen Cheng&rsquo;s book (in which case, you will know it already Duncan). But I did come across this on p.154 of Leslie Carbarga&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/">Logo Font and Lettering Bible.</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Koch-_capitals_3735.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Rudolf Koch&rsquo;s system for determining proportions, based on quartering a square, for Kabel, c.1926. Maybe not a <em> great</em> typeface, William, but certainly much better than many that came after it.</p>
<p>There is of course also <a href="http://www.octavo.com/editions/trychf/"> Geofroy Tory&rsquo;s Champ Fleury</a> which really goes to show that this is an idea that just won&rsquo;t go away. Book Two is where he describes classical letter proportions one by one. I hear there are misgivings about the digital format material that Octavo is putting out, so I would advise you to get hold of the 1967 Dover facsimile of the original Grolier Club edition of 1927.</p>
