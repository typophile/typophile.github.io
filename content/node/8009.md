    target="_blank">here</a> for some excellent suggestions. Mike Yanega mentions
    Article 10, Old Glory, Jeffersonian and American Scribe in his link, which is
    a great start. As for the font in question. It&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/cezanne-regular/p22-cezanne-regular/testdrive.html?s=Support+the+College+Patriot&amp;p=48"
