  body: "It doesn't just <em>look</em> squooshed. Both the original Matrix Wide and
    Narrow were actual stretched and squooshed versions of the standard width Matrix.
    From the <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=105\">Matrix Design
    Info page</a> on the Emigre website:\r\n\r\n<em>\"The original Matrix Wide (left)
    was created by simply stretching the characters horizontally by 200%. This effect
    elongated the serifs. To remain truthful to the original concept behind Matrix,
    the forty five degree serifs were reintroduced in the new version of Matrix Wide.\"</em>"
