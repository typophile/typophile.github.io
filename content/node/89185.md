  of a lettering company I owned in the past.\r\nThese fonts were used in hand setting
  lettering for headline use.\r\nSame font size as Typositor lettering but are film
  positives for hand setting.\r\nUsed for many years they are high quality materials.\r\nI
  would hate to toss them but I have no storage space.\r\nThe fonts are in nine boxes
  10\"x10\"x10\" and weight approx 8# each.\r\nI would be willing to ship to anyone
  willing to pay the freight cost.\r\nPlease let me know if anyone is interested.
  Unfortunately I do have a deadline and need to get rid of them by the end of February.
  Thanks.\r\n\r\n"
