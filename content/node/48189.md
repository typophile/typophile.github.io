  i changed my project's name to yrmk (you rock my kalleidoscope / maracuya) and here
  is a version of the logo with different... is that considered a stern? sorry i'm
  portuguese.\r\nAnyway i need your opinion still not happy with the results of those
  \"sterns\" ( i think it isn't stern )\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo4_4651.jpg]\r\n\r\nBy
  the way this Sloop font is maybe one of the best typefaces i've ever seen congrats
  for the guy who made it!"

    you are using it big like this on posters or something I think it will not come
    across well. On something like the web or a business card it's not going to be
    legible, I fear.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a thicker weight and a bit looser tracking. I
    don't know what else to say other than I think this would be best read and presented
    with more appropriate use of white space.\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "A good point of view tylor but yes, maybe it will be just this size because
    i'll only have this logo on some stuff (that i already know ehehe) anyway i'm
    making other logos and so but i think that type won't work since there will always
    be a stem so it can be really readable. I don't want to get it on a classic way
    i still love japan and so thats why thelines are like this. So... now... i'm doing
    something more on the \"mark\" side.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // yrmk\r\nsound & visual"

    it came from the inicials yrmk.\r\nDone a lot of marks around that one but it
    seems for me (and for the people i asked) that the most calibrated option was
    the best... Anyway i posted my three options so you can get me your opinion too
    (total options were about 20/30, there are the reduced ones)\r\nBut now i'm with
    other problem... Lettering. A mark has always to have a lettering around... people
    just can't spell a mark!\r\nTried a lot of stuff but... not working...\r\nCan
    anyone help? Maybe a font... since the mark is ... the mark! i think i won't need
    a new lettering, i could use a font already made but... can anyone help?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo3reduzido_4021.jpg]\r\n\r\nJoel
