  body: 'Well I just thought it would be nice to add some color to it so it wouldn''t
    look too dull but on the other hand isn''t "st'' and abbreviation for saint or
    street in english. ( which is not my first language) '

  body: "It just seems very arbitrary and makes it read BABOON UDIO. I do like the
    contrast in typefaces and color, though. \r\n\r\nWhat if you instead use the typeface
    that's for 'st' now and make that the typeface for your tagline? "

  body: "Without appearing completely stupid, is that baboon like the ape. Which is
    a great name for a studio, but then the overall look of the card is clinical and
    safe.\r\n\r\nTo me there is very little design factor coming thru on the card,
    it looks like any other card out there, ok, the pink is a bit adventurous.\r\n\r\nNow
    excuse my ignorance while I go down the baboon (ape) tangent, if the ape link
    is the case why not take it out into left field. Have a plain white card with
    the back of a baboons head on it, with the name of the studio shaved into it.\r\n\r\nFood
    for thought, it all boils down to how you want to position yourself in the market."

  body: "The whole idea was to stay simple - hence the tagline. I probably should
    have picked different name for my studio because I prefer simple, clean design
    and baboon well it doesn't match the whole concept :) \r\n\r\n"

  body: Very nice and simple, except that it's easy to just read Baboon Udio.  I think
    that in order to justify the emphasis on the St, it has to have some meaning behind
    it so that it would be more effective. The overall composition of the card is
    really great, though.
