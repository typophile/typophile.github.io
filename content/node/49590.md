  packaging not excited for the Office Programs, but excited for the rights to the
  font(s) I just bought.\r\n\r\nLike I seriously am in love with Calibri: There's
  something about it that somehow makes it float above the (digital) page ever so
  slightly, and it's just very clean. Perhaps a near epitome of what it means to have
  a \"Curvy\" Sans-Serif font.\r\n\r\nBut since the release of Microsoft's OpenType
  (?) fonts, few designers have brought them to mention. (None that I've heard at
  least). Are they scoffed at? Or do we just have too many other things to focus our
  attention on?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    designers. Perhaps there is also a segment of type users who see Colibri and the
    other C-fonts as made specifically for ClearType -- for the screen -- not for
    professional print design.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the series is one of the
    brightest things MS has done in years and they continue to school Apple on commitment
    to typography, but I haven't seen much of the Vista fonts in offline use."

    a few years before you started to see Verdana and Georgia in print, and they had

    CT fonts should have names that started with C. I can't remember all the possible
    names I came up with, each of which ended up rejected after international trademark

  body: "'The Vista fonts are hampered by the anti-Microsoft sentiment common among
    designers.' says Stephen Coles. I don't think so. In my view they're hampered
    by subliminal recognition of unfitness for purpose. The Vista fonts represented
    the chance for the junior designers (under 40s let's say) to prove they could
    do as well as the senior designers (over 40s let's say) when it came to designing
    fonts that would be employed by hundreds of millions of users. \r\n\r\nMany people
    think Calibri is the best. Here's what I don't like about it. I think the angular
    o forms impede readability. I think the calligraphic italic forms impede readability.
    (I am not one of those who thinks that chirographic forms assist readability;
    I think they impair it. There's a reason why we read type more quickly than calligraphy.
    It's precisely because type is non-chirographic. The marketing of calligraphic
    features in type is fine by me -- anything to make a buck -- just don't ask me
    to take type spin any more seriously than any other kind of spin.) \r\n\r\nI truly
    do believe that type destined for the millions should be crystal goblet type.
    It should be transparent. There should be no cutesy features.\r\n\r\nCalibri is
    all about cute. Let's start with the punctuation. The worst feature is the quotation
    marks, which look like falling snowflakes, not quotation marks. You have to keep
    asking yourself 'is this really a quote mark?' They're also badly fitted, with
    's (quoteleft-s) having a greater gap than g' (g-quoteright) for example. But
    wait! This font is designed for use with MS Word, a program which declares kerning
    off by default. With kerning off, there's not just a gap between 's (quoteleft-s)
    but a river and the font is really a mess. \r\n\r\nKerning is being used here
    to fix bad spacing, a poor design philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe question mark is slightly
    too large to seem transparent, and the comma is almost as bad as the snowflakes.
    It's not where you expect it to be, it's not the shape you expect it to be. That's
    the definition of what cute is and transparent is not. \r\n\r\nThe default g is
    so clotted there has to be an alternate g. But who is going to figure out how
    to use it? \r\n\r\nThe ascenders/descenders are misproportioned. For this design,
    there needs to be fractionally more descender length, even if it has to be at
    the expense of ascenders. \r\n\r\nFinally -- for this very brief look, try to
    type some text using Calibri. One of the most frequent errors you make when typing
    is one space instead of two or two instead of one. With Calibri, the on-screen
    representation of the space is too thin. It's impossible to have an intuitive
    sense whether you have typed one space or two. Somehow, with all the classic Microsoft
    fonts, you can tell this. \r\n\r\nAt that point I give up - - these guys can't
    even get the space character right? It's scarcely worth discussing. I realize
    I'm not going to win any popularity prizes by being so harsh, but I don't think
    there's any other way to get better type. \r\n\r\nWho knows? Maybe everyone will
    get used to this stuff? If they do, no sweat. But to eyes accustomed to the level
    of excellence that was customary just five or ten years ago, that's a stretch. "

    think its getting ignored because its a default font, and as a designer we have
    a tendency of not to go with the defaults. We always try to do some value addition
    even when its not needed sometimes.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I never got the chance to look at Calibri that closely; I just printed one
    sample page a while ago. But I do like the design overall. Here are my very rough
    impressions (keep in mind that's what they are):\r\n\r\nMany of the design details
    Bill Troop pointed out as being too cute didn't bother me. The o doesn't strike
    me as being angular, maybe because I'm just so used to seeing square sans designs
    these days. The ascender-descender proportions look fine to me, although again
    that is perhaps because I'm so used to extremely minimal descender lengths of
    latin components of CJK fonts.\r\n\r\nI did notice the spacing problems with the
    single quotes that Bill mentionned, and I remember wondering what the rationale
    was. Possibly something to do with different quotation marks used for different
    languages... The design itself of the single and double quotes struck me odd as
    well, and I remember thinking it was maybe a screen font thing. It will be interesting
    to hear the designer's reasoning for these choices.\r\n\r\nThe double-storey default
    <em>g</em> is too busy perhaps, but I'm trying to make my peace with double-storey
    <em>g</em>s in sans designs (they seem to be in fashion after all) and there is
    no real way to completely avoid a cluttered look with double-storey <em>g</em>s.
    I never got to look at the italic too closely, so I can't comment on it.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    I think because of what I'm used to seeing nowadays, Calibri looks quite neutral
    to me. I think there are definitely shifts in the sensibilities in typeface designs
    over time and maybe Calibri will be dated soon (\"Look at those early-century
    square <em>o</em>s!\"). But I'm not really sure it represents a drop in the level
    of typographic excellence as Bill stated, although if his point is mainly based
    on the punctuation marks, then I see his position. A default font used by millions
    should be held up to higher standards, after all."

    sans serif family with subtle roundings on stems and corners.  However, as the

    Gotham Rounded is a bit more outspoken than Calibri. I believe that fonts with
    rounded corners are just not that suitable for papers/reports etc. A lot of fellow
    students use Calibri for their theses/dissertations. It's just too informal. Thesis
    Sans (also by Lucas de Groot) is Calibri without rounded corners. MS sould've
    stuck with Lucas de Groot's initial proposal.
