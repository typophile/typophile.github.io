  body: "I believe the Insert Image feature here relies on Flash. Given all the well-publicized
    furor over Apple & Flash, I\u2019m guessing that Safari 5 does not play well with
    Flash.\r\n\r\nNot sure what it would take for the Punchcut folks to rewrite the
    image upload without Flash."

  body: Try setting Safari to Open in 32 bit mode in Get Info  box - I have it set
    that way for my Hear software (audio improvement from Joesoft) since it will not
    run in 64 bit mode yet.

  body: "Well, it appears that Safari 5 is a bit finicky about the type of image --
    it kind of worked with a jpeg, although there was still an error message under
    the post-box\u2026 Tried it again with a screenshot converted to a jpeg and Safari
    crashed on me.\r\n\r\nSo no image in this post..."
