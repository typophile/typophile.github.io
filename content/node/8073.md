body: Hello, <BR> <BR>Me again. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve downloaded a font. Made some heavy
  modifications to it, now I want to generate new font files to install to my system.
  How do I rename the font? When I try to install it in Windows, it think its an exact
  duplicate. I want both the original and my mod font on the system. <BR> <BR>Any
  help is greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Lucas

  body: When you have the font open in Fontographer, you can change the name by selecting
    &#34;Font Info...&#34; from the &#34;Element&#34; menu and editing the &#34;Family
    Name&#34; field.
