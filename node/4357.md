  body: I&#39;m pretty sure this logo pre-dates digital type, but for &#34;HARLEY-DAVIDSON&#34;,
    one of the weights of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr/">Red
    Rooster Block Gothic</a>, optically compressed a little bit, would come very close.
    <BR> <BR>I bet dollars to donuts that &#34;MOTOR CYCLES&#34; is hand-drawn/custom.
    <BR> <BR>If you just need the logo in eps format, try <a href="http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&amp;query_id=4131853&amp;page=1&amp;brand_id=1785">here</a>.
