body: "i'm trying to draw a rounded foot of the lowercase \"k\" using Illustrator.
  therefore i'm using a circle where the radius r of the circle r equals the stroke
  width d. the foot touches the baseline. the only question is how to align the edge
  of the red circle to the stroke edges a and b?\r\n\r\nhow could I do that?\r\n"

  body: the circle will be slightly too wide, but I wuld simply use smart guides tdrag
    the nearest edge of the circle to the line, then taper out the other edge correspondingly.

  body: what i'm looking for is a sort of snapping, to snap the circle edge to the
    stroke edge. i tried smart guides but they only show the intersection point, not
    a "touch"-point.

    to the centre of the circle. Where the line intersects the edge of the circle,
    draw a horizontal line. Match the intersection of the circle and the new horizontal
    line to the intersection of the 'k' and the horizontal line.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
