body: "It appears patently obvious that, with the exception of four individuals known
  to me, the entire type community is quite content to let the eradication of my brand
  stand unchallenged: as you wish.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I intend to inform the following
  entities, known to me to have purchased fonts branded with my formerly credible
  suffix NF, that third parties have either actively destroyed\u2014or passively allowed
  to be destroyed\u2014that brand, which is my name and my face:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft
  (Xbox)\r\nElectronic Arts\r\nSega Europe\r\nHasbro Toys\r\nWalt Disney Pictures
  (big black cock!)\r\nHarper-Collins\r\nBurger King\r\nMcGraw-Hill (although still
  pending, so they can get out of the deal)\r\n\r\nThe publishers of books and magazines
  too numerous to mention which have featured my works under my brand name.\r\nAs
  soon as practicable, I shall have my attorney-in-fact\u2014my kid brother, Tracy
  Peter Curtis, Esq., J.D.\u2014draft a conciliatory document, offering my condolences
  that these entities\u2014and any other members of a potential plaintiff class\u2014of
  the unintended consequences of many third parties\u2019 actions.\r\n\r\nThe sole
  individual who offered to \u201Ctake my entire type library off of my hands\u201D
  did not read my post entirely, so you should not expect a reply.\r\n\r\nThanks to
  all, and good day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
