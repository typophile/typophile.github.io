body: "This past summer I printed a small specimen book of 19th century ornamented
  metal typefaces from the collection at Wells College.\r\n\r\nThe book is printed
  in two colors on Arches text laid and all the types are 24 points and higher, one
  specimen is 72 points. Each typeface gets its own page with a complete showing of
  all the sorts available in the case. Only one or two faces are missing sorts. There
  are many shaded ones.\r\n\r\nThe typefaces are:\r\nTinted, Tasso, Banquet, Antique
  Extra Condensed, Aquatint, Dandy, Modoc, Columbus, Art Gothic, Rubens, Yukon Pointed,
  Tuscan Stellar, Halftone, Obelisk, Alpine, Gothic Shade, Ruskin, Condensed Roman,
  Ray Shade, Tuscan Floral, Souvenir and Aurora Uncial. \r\nThe labels, front matter
  and colophon are all set in Dante.\r\n\r\nThe last is a rare uncial cut by Victor
  Hammer while he was at Wells for ATF, they never produced it but Theo Rehak started
  casting it when he acquired the remains of ATF. \r\n\r\nI only printed 20 copies,
  but I still have some available for $75, and there are also some proof copies on
  Mohawk Superfine for $40.\r\n\r\n"
