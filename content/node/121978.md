  body: "There are a few digitalisation of the genre, mostly \u201Cfree fonts\u201D,
    usually not of the best quality, as you already noticed.\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/l/lettres.htm\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/westwind/exotica.htm\r\n(I
    can\u2019t find an oblique version)\r\n\r\nLooking at past threads (http://typophile.com/node/67020
    http://typophile.com/node/42149 http://typophile.com/node/73447 http://www.typophile.com/node/106599)
    it seems that one still can acquire it in metal and there are at least two commercial
    releases:  \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/celebrity/parisian-ornamentals/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/fleurons-initials/
    (this one is a less textured version)\r\nThe fact that they\u2019re commercial
    doesn\u2019t automatically guarantee a better quality.\r\n\r\nWith the recent
    popularity of chromatic fonts and the efforts to fill the gaps in the Dan X. Solo\u2019s
    collections, there could be some new offering somewhere too."

    are in a passable digitization as \"Parisian Ornamentals.\" Were also available
    as a set of Letraset dry contact letters. Compare to a fairly high quality specimen
    full alphabet in Lambert's _Letter Forms_[1964] at page 130. Sample: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LettresOrn\xE9esDebernyPeignot1820Lambert130detailSM_4077.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: The Westwind Exotica glyphs are pretty good except that they each have over
    2500 points - making them tricky for printing. The Stefan ones are OK but not
    very detailed by comparison.

  body: "Too many points is the problem with making any of these elaborate ornamented
    fonts.\r\nAbout half a decade ago I took a stab at making a well engineered version
    of Lettres Orn\xE9es with the minimum number of points. I got as far as doing
    part of the letter _E_\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LettresOrn\xE9es1_6253.jpg]
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LettresOrn\xE9es3_6382.jpg]\r\nAt the rate
    I was going it would have taken an incredible amount of time to do the full alphabet!\r\nSo
    I threw in the towel. A project for somebody with lots of time on their hands!\r\nWhich
    probably explains why we are stuck with mega-point digital versions that sometimes
    seize up during viewing and fail in printing.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "That's interesting. I can see why there hasn't been a better version of these
    ornate fonts available yet.\r\nI guess these type of fonts would be best to be
    done as layered typefaces? These would probably split the type into several fonts
    but the point would probably be a lot lower in this case?\r\n\r\nI am not a typeface
    designer so I am not sure all the technical details but it seems layered fonts
    are popular nowadays?...."

  body: Perhaps a layered version, with few ornaments on each layer would be a good
    solution in order to have high resolution reproduction and easy printing, but
    will take even longer to make (and to set).

  body: "This version of Madame is well made but I find it awkward to use.\r\nIt seems
    to have been designed for the era when printers had severe memory limitations.\r\nOut
    of curiosity I assembled the parts into complete letters about a decade ago and
    tested them on a basic laser printer. Worked fine.\r\nBTW, Madame has far fewer
    points than any of the ornamented fonts mentioned in this thread.\r\nDon\r\n"
