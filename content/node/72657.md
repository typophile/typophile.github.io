body: "Hey everyone, I've been working to help my employers compile a folder with
  all of our organization's partner companies' logos. Unfortunately, some of those
  companies who are non-profit, do not have the best system for their logos. \r\n\r\nThus,
  I've been unofficially commissioned to essentially recreate them to have them in
  higher quality and an editable format.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DVACK_3596.png]\r\n\r\nI've
  already recreated the symbol part of this logo, but I haven't been able to identify
  the font-face, which I will need to know if I am to make an exact remake.\r\n\r\nAny
  and all help is extremely appreciated!\r\n\r\n[EDIT] I apologize for the low quality
  and small size of the font, but that's the reason I'm redoing it, that's the largest
  size of the logo we currently have available. [/EDIT]"

  body: "Identifont says FF Tartine Script TF is close, and I'd agree, but there are
    too many differences for it to be the exact font. Personally, I've found that
    a few glyphs from Freestyle Script are very close.\r\n\r\nAs more background on
    the logo, it couldn't have been made more than a few years ago, 15 years tops.
    It was made, if not for the web, then with emphasis on digital usage.\r\n\r\nI
    doubt it was done with a professional or expensive font, as DVACK is a NPO (non-profit
    organization), and the logo was most likely done by a volunteer. That being said,
    no one really knows who designed it originally, so it's possible the font is an
    expensive one (or maybe even a custom one, though I highly doubt that)."
