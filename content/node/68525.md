  attached jpeg. I know the actual font was designed exclusively so I can't use it,
  so would like to know of anything similar.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_3550.png]"

    maybe there's something there:\r\nhttp://www51.academy.typophile.com/node/56381\r\n\r\nI
    think, as riccard0 suggested, Democratica would be a good solution. Priori serif
    has some of that feel.\r\n"

  body: "I was in Chester just before Christmas and the first thing that struck me
    was that appalling font - it's everywhere and it's an eyesore; it is so badly
    done. That pseudo medieval feel is just totally amateurish. I seem to remember
    the Ww's are back to front.\r\n\r\nYou'd be better off using anything else in
    a similar vein."
