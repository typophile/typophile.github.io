		<div class="commentbody"> apparently, I got the image right, but the text is gone... <BR>so, here comes the brief: this is the rough sketch I did for a russian client, ang he liked the logotype enough to drop the suggested symbol. <BR>however, there are things bothering me about the overall balance. maybe you could suggest some tunings to make it look better. <BR>and the second issue: though there are only a few letters displayed here, do you think these have potential to be extended into a full character set? do you have any recollection of similar fonts? <BR> <BR>thank you all, <BR> <BR>george // cellsius creative <BR> <BR>P.S. this is my first attempt at designing lower cases. please, don&#39;t be too harsh :-&#41; </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> As shapes, I like it. What&#39;s the company about? <BR> <BR>As a logo, it might need to be a bit darker, but the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;a&#34; are already too cramped, so try making the &#34;n&#34; &#40;especially&#41; and the &#34;c&#34; and &#34;o&#34; narrower. The thing at the bottom of the &#34;el&#34; is too subtle, and as a result out of character too - but don&#39;t make it curl &#40;it would create more color problems&#41; - just make it straight. The &#34;c&#34; is structurally superb, just make the top-right curve more round and remove the slight flare from the bottom finial. <BR> <BR>I think it could work as a font. If you go that way, do something original with the caps &#40;maybe uncial forms&#41;, since your &#34;a&#34; is already unconventional &#40;and we already have a lot of boring caps&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the Metsys lettering. I have done plenty of mods to Metsys myself. I took the liberty of  <BR>doing a few tweaks I think may help you in solving your problem. The Metsys &#34;n&#34; is really nice, I think it could really helps define the &#34;a&#34; as the rounded &#34;a&#34; you did is perhaps a bit illegible without the context of the rest of the surrounding letters. I would also widen the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;a&#34; as shown. Hope I was of some help.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1495.jpg" ALT="Elanco mods.jpg"></div>

		<div class="commentbody"> I do like it. <BR> <BR>one thing that strikes me about this, in all <BR>of its versions shown, is how the first three <BR>characters call attention to themselves. Because <BR>of this, and only in my opinion, the last three <BR>characters seem less important. hmmm. Need the <BR>right words.  <BR> <BR>&#40;pause&#41;  <BR> <BR>Because the &#39;e&#39; and the &#39;a&#39; have so much <BR>character, the focus, through my eyes only perhaps,  <BR>isn&#39;t evenly distributed&#40;?&#41;.
