  body: "1. It all depends on the context. Right now people seem to think that counterless
    art-deco revivals and derivatives possess those qualities. Five years ago they
    would have just looked dated or historical.\r\n2. Any hi-contrast serif with an
    appropriate optical weight.\r\n3. That\u2019s why Ogilvy and Pentagram didn\u2019t
    corner the design market decades ago.\r\n4. Convince them. Or just change and
    take their money. Or drop them and move on.\r\n\r\n<cite>How can we best communicate

    do you communicate with other people about type?</cite>\r\n\r\nHere, via email,
    or preferably in-person over a beer, joint, etc.\r\n\r\n<cite>Do you reference

    tend to go with Vox so people don\u2019t think I\u2019m being pedantic, although
    I avoid using the term \u201Ctransitional\u201D because it\u2019s a rather stupid
    term.\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026are your clients on the same page?</cite>\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    pretty sure that when I have clients, they\u2019re paying me so that they don\u2019t
    have to worry about those pages."
