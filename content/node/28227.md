  body: "I'd definitely say it isn't custom looking at the relationship between 'l'
    and 's' at the end. If it is the mind boggles why they came up with that. and
    if it isn't it's plain untidy to leave it hanging of the end like that.\r\n\r\nOh

  body: "I did look in the Script Font ID Guide, Part 1, and found no close matches.
    Also checked several of my font books with nothing very close anywhere. I found
    a very similar K in McGrew's book on metal typefaces, in the ATF typeface called
    'Typo Slope', attributed to Benton in 1905. I thought maybe a metal face could
    explain the gap for the apostrophe, because hand-drawn lettering I would have
    expected to connect the l and s. However, Typo Slope has a looped ascender on
    the 'h', and the 'l' loop is not the same shape as the sample.\r\n\r\nI think
    Stephen's suggestions are all pretty good ones.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
