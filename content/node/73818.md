body: "A new version (3.0.1) of <strong><em>DTL LetterModeller</em></strong> (LeMo)
  is available for (free) downloading:\r\n&ndash; <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/LEMO/LeMo_301_MAC.zip\">Mac
  OS</a>\r\n&ndash; <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/LEMO/LeMo_301_WIN.zip\">Windows</a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_1_5601.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPart
  of the new functionality is the support for <em>skeleton</em>, i.e. heart line fonts.
  The construction of the Humanistic minuscule, of which the primary harmonic model
  (phm) for the minuscules is a stripped version, i.e. the superfluous elements are
  removed, is the result of canalization/formalization by the broad nib (determined
  by friction and preferred contrast-flow) of repetitive movements, which date back
  to the Romans (see the illustration of the Latin cursive alphabets as written with
  a pen by the Romans, taken from E. Maunde Thompson&rsquo;s  <em>Introduction to
  Greek and Latin Palaeography</em> [1912] below). The capitals however, find their
  origin in the heart line construction applied by the Greeks, which were adapted
  for writing with a flat brush by the Romans without significant changes in their
  construction. Hence the basis of these capitals can&rsquo;t be formed by a model
  comparable with the phm.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_2_4629.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHeart
  line character descriptions for for instance the capitals or for the minuscules
  outside the phm, i.e. the &lsquo;spectacle&rsquo; g, the s (the long s belongs to
  the phm) and the v&ndash;z range, can be added and combined with the phm. All parameters
  will be applied on the single-stroke definitions too. This &lsquo;skeleton&rsquo;
  font has to be in the Ikarus format and (for the moment) the name is hard coded
  and should be &lsquo;skeleton.ik&rsquo;, otherwise the file will not be recognized.
  For the Windows version the skeleton font should be placed in the current working
  directory, i.e., where the program executable resides. On the Mac, the file is expected
  to reside in one of the application&rsquo;s subdirectories, namely in .../phm.app/Contents/MacOS/.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_3_5493.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe
  skeleton font can contain all characters in the ASCII range (see also the &lsquo;Read
  Me&rsquo; file). In case of an overlap with the characters that are constructed
  using the harmonic models, the characters in the skeleton font will supersede the
  ones in these. The height of the capitals is connected to the ascender height, i.e.
  when the length of the ascenders is changed, the height of the capitals will be
  changed accordingly. The basis for this relation, i.e. the starting point for the
  transformations, is defined by the relation between the capitals and the phm when
  applying a certain range of parameters. One way to define this relation is to reduce
  the pen width for both the phm and the capitals to a single line, i.e. a skeleton
  construction. This relation can for instance be like Claude Garamond applied, which
  is described in the illustration (for which the Adobe Garamond Premier was used)
  below.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_4_4394.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSkeleton
  fonts can be constructed using DTL IkarusMaster (light) or with any other font (Bezier)
  editor and subsequently converted by DTL IkarusMaster (light) to IK format. Because
  the construction of the serifs is related to that of the primary harmonic model,
  serifs cannot be added to the skeleton font using the applicable radio buttons.
  Exceptions to the parameters cannot be applied to the skeleton font either (for
  the moment).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe &lsquo;Pen thickness&rsquo; parameter is supported
  now. &lsquo;Auto spacing&rsquo; based on the rhythmic system (see also <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/66574\">this
  topic</a>) is automatically applied on the letters from the primary harmonic model.
  The secondary harmonic model is treated differently: the right side of the k, and
  the left and right sides of the v-z range, are just spaced &lsquo;tightly&rsquo;
  (50 IK-units). The RSB/LSB values of the characters in the &lsquo;skeleton.ik&rsquo;
  file are taken from this file. Pen width and angle have an influence on these side
  bearings as well.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_5_4562.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAn
  outline editor, which makes glyph editing possible after exporting the font data,
  has been added. Glyphs can be exported in the EPS and SVG formats from the glyph
  editor. Basically this editor is identical to the one in DTL OTMaster, so the applicable
  part of the <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/OTM_manual.zip\">OT Manual</a>
  can be used for reference.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB\r\n"

    because the parameters can be applied on \u2018skeleton\u2019 lines, this works
    on outlines also. So, existing fonts can be converted to IK format and modified
    in LeMo using the sliders \u2013for instance to make some proofs for other weights.
    \r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_transform_2_4243.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOf
    course, one gets also to a certain extend distortions for free and the overlaps
    have to be removed afterwards (for instance in the LeMo glyph editor).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_transform_1a_4368.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFor
    the examples the regular weight of DTL Haarlemmer was used.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB\r\n"

  body: 'In brief: First, click the button "Create font data", this is the topmost
    button on the right side of the window. Then, click the button "Edit font data",
    right below it. This will show a Font Viewer. Then double-click on any glyph in
    the glyph overview. This will show the Glyph Editor. (Mind that you will be editing
    Ikarus outlines which behave differently than Bezier outlines.)'
