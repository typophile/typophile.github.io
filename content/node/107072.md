  Building by Emory Roth in the Garment District in Manhattan. \"FREIGHT\" was carved
  over the freight entrance. Above the main entrance it once said \"No. 135\" but
  mid-century renovations have ruined the original details. I'm looking for the original
  font used, or something I could use as a replacement.\r\nMore images of the original
  here:\r\nhttp://www.skyscraper.org/EXHIBITIONS/URBAN_FABRIC/wall06.php\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    was a point of pride for architects of the era to design their own lettering and
    not use something off the shelf. But then again there may be a font from the era
    or earlier with exactly these letters.\r\ndon"

    them may be close enough to work for you.

  body: "Good find George. As good a choice as any available digital font for a replacement,
    preferably with some adjustments.  Durer redrew the Roman inscription letters
    with compass and straight edge. It's no surprise that the result would be similar
    to some of the renderings of the Roman inscription letters by early 20th century
    architects.\r\nDon"
