  worldwide independent resource center for dissemination of information about type,
  its history, development, and its use in documents, and is housed in the School
  of Printing Management and Sciences at [[RIT|Rochester Institute of Technology]].
  The Center offers courses addressing a broad range of technical, aesthetic, historic,
  and legal aspects of alphabets and typefaces, including those from both Western
  and non-Western cultures, as well as offering courses focused on the typography
  and design of documents. A major area of concern in the Center's courses and research
  is the development of multicultural document creation skills.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rit.edu/~goudyctr/"
