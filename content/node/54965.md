  body: Yes I could read it. To untrained eyes it could be difficult to parse though.
    A lot depends on your target audience.

  body: "What is this for -- a logo? The colors are very bright which doesn't help
    with legibility. Okay some letters are easier to decipher then others (\"c\" \"o\"
    \"d\" \"l\"). The \"e\" \"r\" \"s\" are hard for me to read. \r\n\r\nthe letter
    \"l\" overlapping the \"d\" and making another shade adds an extra layer of confusion.
    \r\n\r\nmaybe use the letter \"c\" by itself as a mark? \r\n\r\nyou tried something
    different kudos for that. But don't stop here. "
