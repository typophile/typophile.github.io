body: "hello.\r\ni'm looking for a typeface family which has within it different looks.
  what i want to do is represent several different levels of text in the same typeface
  so it clearly all belongs together, but i want the type to progressively change
  in appearance as you read through, in a gradual way (so apply one weight or style
  to the first line, then the next style to the next line and so on, to show a gradual
  morphing).  in particular i'd like the type to become progressively more ornate
  if this is possible. does anyone know of anything that does this? the project is
  for print, not motion graphics. hope i've explained it clearly enough but let me
  know if i need to clarify."

    to set to make the shift noticeable, but you might try to find a [[superfamilies|superfamily]]
    that has several different styles: sans, semisans, semiserif, serif.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "You could (mis)use one of the huge <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html\">Adobe
    families</a> like Warnock, Arno or Garamond Premier Pro for that; they do not
    only offer a wide range of weights, but also have optical sizes for each of the
    weights.\r\n\r\n<cite>progressively more ornate</cite>\r\nThe italics of these
    faces \u2013 among other recent (super)families \u2013 come with swash alternates
    that could be switched on, but there\u2019s no progression to it.\r\n\r\nAn alternative
    idea:\r\nIf you (or your school) have a rather rich type library, you could scroll
    through the history of type; e.g. starting with Akzidenz Grotesk and Folio, proceed
    with Helvetica, then Univers, followed by Frutiger, Lucida, Stone Sans, TheSans
    etc.\r\nThat would free you from being dependent on the range of weights/styles
    of one specific typeface \u2013\_but there are myriads of possibilities, and it\u2019s
    not an easy undertaking.\r\n\r\nHow many degrees of progression do you need?"

  body: "i'd say i need about 15 degrees of progression. re the history of type idea:
    that's something i've already considered, and although it's a lovely concept,
    many of the faces are pretty timeless in appearance, plus their date of birth
    won't mean much to someone who isn't a typophile (i.e. the people who will be
    looking at the final piece). \r\n\r\nthanks so much for your suggestions everyone..
    there are some lovely typefaces there, but unfortunately none are yet quite right.
    i'll check out the warnock/garamond/arno suggestion next though. \r\n\r\nare there
    any that progress from serif to san serif, does anyone know? (chalet does seem
    to)\r\n\r\n"
