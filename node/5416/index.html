<p>I created my own Thread by now in which you could give your Critique to the BlackPearl   ;-)
Sorry for Hi-Jacking this Thread ( I really like the Adam-Font &hellip; think it&rsquo;s far better than my Bastarda, although they are quite different )</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the new BlackPearl Thread : <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15888">http://typophile.com/node/15888</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, the Village Hebrew type you mentioned above is <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Kaas/mudTyper+Weights/">Kaas</a>. It isn&rsquo;t really a Hebrew typeface per se, rather a big OpenType font with Hebrew characters in it as well. Most of the glyphs are Latin. All in all, I like [[Kaas]]. Maybe you&rsquo;d like to discuss it in an additional thread? I&rsquo;d like to keep this on track, mainly because Paul had better finish <strong>Adam</strong> as soon as possible if he knows what&rsquo;s good for him ;-)</p>
<p>[moderator&rsquo;s message]I&rsquo;d like to encourage everyone to keep talking about <strong>Black Pearl</strong> as well—but please, in its own thread. You can go there via <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15888">this link</a>![/moderator&rsquo;s message]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, I assume that [[Kaas]] is being primarially marketed to Latin users and as a Latin typeface. Inasmuch, it isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;Hebrew&rdquo; typeface, per se. Although I&rsquo;m sure that you can set excellent Hebrew display strings with it (disclaimer, I cannot weigh in pro or against the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too little about the writing system :-(  ).</p>
<p>It is just like I wouldn&rsquo;t call [[Helvetica Linotype]] a Hebrew typeface, even though John Hudson included Hebrew into its character set. Helvetica Linotype is a Latin face that can also set Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. Or maybe it is a global face that can set Latin (even Vietnamese!), Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. But the main focus &amp; audience of the font isn&rsquo;t Hebrew (disclaimer, I cannot weigh in pro or against the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too little about the writing system :-(  ).</p>
<p>Yes, I must have posted somewhere that I find the idea of Hebrew blackletter distasteful. I love Blackletter, and I love Hebrew, but I wouldn&rsquo;t ever mix the two, personally. Maybe there is someone who can pull that off—maybe Kaas does it—but the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; just doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me. I&rsquo;d rather not go there.</p>

<p>To each their own I guess, but if blackletter was good enough for Gutenberg, who was jewish by the looks of things, why so squeemish?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t see how the idea of &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; (<cite>especially</cite> in terms of marketing) is useful here. Nour &amp; Patria is meant as a &ldquo;multi-balanced&rdquo; system for both scripts (which I would argue is the ideal), and it&rsquo;s marketed (well, maybe not yet) to whoever wants to use whichever of its components (including the subordinates as stand-alones). Does that mean it&rsquo;s neither Armenian nor Latin?!  :-/</p>
<p>That said, maybe calling Kaas a &ldquo;Hebrew typeface&rdquo; can be
confusing; but really, that&rsquo;s just a terminological issue.
You can set blackletter Hebrew in it - that&rsquo;s what counts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the “idea” just doesn’t sit well with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re having a terminological gallstone? :-)
Maybe you even wish it didn&rsquo;t have Hebrew in it?
I hope the designer shows up.</p>

<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>Wow, I haven&rsquo;t ever heard this before. Can you point me to the scholarship that has lead you in this direction? That would be something for conspiracy theorists, all right…</p>
<p>…and here I thought all along that Gutenberg was so interested in making money from the Catholic Church because he had to face the harsh reality of having a Patrician father and commoner mother (both of who, I had also always assumed, were Catholics as well…), and therefore got to grow up in the midst of Mainzer aristocracy, without getting to be an aristocrat himself :(</p>
