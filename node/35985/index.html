<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi there! I just found this great forum about type and typography. It's great to see so many people on here who are actually in design and print industry. I enjoy designing as a hobby, but don't have any previous education on any of it. So forgive my ignorance in advance.
I decided to embark on a very interesting journey - starting my own IT consulting company. I am at the point where I need to have a logo for the company so that I can print business cards and stationary. The full company name is Adonai Technology Services. The word "adonai" simply means "lord" or "master". It is found in the Hebrew Old Testament and is one of the many names of God. The services that "adonai" offers are geared towards small and mid-size business. IT consulting is the best way to describe it. This includes: building, managing, and maintaining business computer networks, email and other communications. In the future I plan to offer web design services as well.
I like all lower case characters for "adonai", it makes it more accessible (personal) and less corporate. I also like just the word "adonai" by itself without the "Technology Services". It makes it look less cluttered and creates interest in wanting to find out more what it is and what the company does.
I really need your help guys with some ideas and suggestions for the logo. I am open to different colors and fonts. It's the worst trying to create something for yourself. It never is good enough.

Here is what i have so far: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/adonai_3534.gif]</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don’t think your current choice of letterforms works. Those letters derive from Herbet Bayer’s universal alphabet, and hearken to design of the 1920s/30s and the late 1970s ad early 1980s. I think that a tech company should use type that’s more contemporary without getting into cheesy computer/scifi cliches.
If you want a cheap deal on a logo design I’ve got a few weeks to kill before school starts...

<div class=commentbody>I think you are right, jpad. I realized after a while that ABC (the TV channel) uses the same font for their logo. Do you have any font suggestions that are contemporary or not as cliched?</div>

<div class=commentbody><a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_dax_bold/?sample_text=adonai&sample_size=36">Dax is nice</a>.
<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typotheque/fedra_sans_normal_italic/?sample_text=adonai&sample_size=36">Fedra Sans Normal Italic</a> would really look great in a logo if the square dot over <strong>i</strong> were changed to a round dot.</div>
