body: This is the first time I have attempted to draw letters on my own (only the
  devnagari ones) and am looking for feedback. Chhayachitra is a Hindi word meaning
  photograph. It is a combination of two words chhaya+chitra (shadow+picture). The
  logo is for a photographer based in India whose work mostly consists of wedding
  photography. He needed the name clearly readable in Hindi for Hindi speaking clients
  and in English for registration purpose. I suggested the use of Hindi letters as
  a visual element that could be used indipendently and yet carried the name of his
  firm. The version with Latin characters is simply for legal purposes. Any comment
  or critique is welcome. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/chhayachitra_logo_6029.jpg]
