  of them is the one I live in. I will be printing on gold foil and apply over the
  glass above the door.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if any of you has a source of
  \"house number styles\" that is organized by the date where the house was built.\r\n\r\nI
  appreciate any information and I will post the progress later.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: Thank you. It is very helpful but I still looking for resources to be truthful
    to the time period which those homes were built.

    you\u2019ll probably be able to find pictures of houses from the period in your

  body: ITC Bodoni Twelve or Seventy-Two (oldstyle figures only, of course) accurately
    recall the late 19th century without being too aggressive about it. Take a look.
    There are plenty of display faces for your period, but you may want a type family
    that can be used in print pieces about these buildings as well as signage.
