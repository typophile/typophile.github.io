  body: We noticed some odd FontShop domains appearing in Google today as well and
    thought it was something wrong on our end. I am starting to think this is a Google
    thing.

    URL is typophile.bigcartel), and dev is christian's computer :) I am sure Joe
    can speak for the birthday one.\r\n\r\nAnyone can insert pretty much any word
    prior to .typophile.com and still be routed to the Typophile home page. How it
    gets indexed on Google, I have no idea."

  body: I believe that if the URL is on an external (or maybe even an internal page)
    and it links to a valid page on typophile.com Google will follow and index that
    URL. This explains our fontmagazine.com address appearing in Google. The solution
    is to disable domain "masing" and make sure all subdomains are redirected to your
    main domain.

  body: It could be "rainbows not typophile" some kind of pro gay-rights font fan
    with a grudge against the site?

  body: "Thomas, thanks for that link.\r\nI don\u2019t think this practice is a good
    idea. Again and again, the search results are cluttered with duplicate content:
    one specific wiki page or one profile page gets listed over and over again with
    changing subdomain \u2018prefixes\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s annoying.\r\n\r\nAnd
    are those URIs supposed to stay? I mean, when people who are unaware of these
    subtleties want to cross-reference threads, look up the address via Google & Co
    and then insert some \u2018rainbow snot birthday\u2019 \u2013 what will happen
    to these links in the future?\r\n\r\nTo me, it sounded quite plausible what Jeff
    Croft contributed to Roger Johansson\u2019s recent article <a href=\"http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200802/make_sure_your_website_works_with_or_without_www/\">\u2018Make
    sure your website works with or without www\u2019</a>:\r\n<cite>There should always,
    always, always be only one URI for any given resource. [\u2026] Canonical URIs
    are good. Multiple URIs for the same resource are bad. Period.</cite>"
