body: "I've been working as a designer in Japan for the last 7 years, and picked up
  a handful of tricks and rules of thumb to keep me out of trouble when designing
  Japanese or Japanese/English print pieces and websites, <a href=\"http://www.aqworks.com/2004/10/15/japanese-typography-on-the-web-and-beyond-part-one/\">some
  of which</a> <a href=\"http://www.aqworks.com/2004/10/27/japanese-typography-on-the-web-and-beyond-part-two/\">I
  shared on my blog</a> a few years ago.\r\n\r\nSince then, I've had a few opportunities
  to design in other languages, and never ran into any major issues. Until recently
  when I hit a few copy-fitting bumps with German during a redesign project for a
  website that needs to support a dozen European languages.\r\n\r\nIs there any resource
  out there that has some basic basic practices for designing in various languages?
  If not, shall we start one in this thread?\r\n\r\nHere's my incomplete contribution
  to kick things off:\r\n\r\n(All relative adjustments are \"_____ than same in English\")\r\n\r\nJapanese:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A
  little more leading to let heavy, mono-width/height Kanji breath.</li>\r\n<li>More
  reliance on decorative elements for list items (no caps in Ja.)</li>\r\n<li>Web-only:
  More reliance on graphic text (less system fonts to choose from)</li>\r\n<li>Web-only:
  WinXP will round down odd numbered font-sizes (e.g. 11px -> 10px)</li>\r\n<li>Allow
  for more design time for tracking/kerning adjustments.</li>\r\n<li>For multi-lingual:
  labels/navigation/titles can be drastically longer/shorter than En. Get key copy
  early for testing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nGerman (courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.informationarchitects.jp\">Oliver
  R.</a>)\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wider columns (to accommodate longer words)</li>\r\n<li>Slightly
  more leading (to accommodate more capitalized words)</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In Spanish there's no real different concern.  Used to be you'd removed accents
    on the vowels when in all caps situations, but that's no longer the case.  I would
    only highly recommend that angle quotes are used instead of curly quotes, as they
    are prefered by the RAE.\r\n\r\nAlso, that labels and such can be much shorter
    or longer is standard for any translation.  In general, the recommendations I've
    also seen and used is to assume and prepare for up to a 50% increase in length
    of text when going from any one language to another.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro

    an interesting issue. Modern German punctuation uses what most of think of as
    the 'left quote' mark \u201C to close quotations, but the expectation of German
    typography is that this glyph curls or leans away from the text, as is the case
    in most serif faces and <em>some</em> sans serif faces. San serif faces that were
    designed specifically to work well on screen present a problem, though, because
    the easiest way to make the quote marks distinguishable at low resolution is to
    lean them in opposite directions (following a common written form, at least in
    Anglo-American usage). As you observe, this produces the 'wrong' form for the
    German closing quotes."

  body: "Joe,\r\n\r\nSorry, some of my points were worded vaguely enough to be misinterpreted
    into the worst possible practices. You may disagree with some of them anyway,
    but they are based on my experience designing and coding Japanese and Ja/En websites
    over several years, with periodic experimentation and research as browsers and
    techniques changed. \r\n\r\nI make mistakes sometimes, and I don't work for the
    W3C or an accessibility research group, so my advice may not be perfect, but on
    the whole it's worked well enough for my clients and their visitors. \r\n\r\nGetting
    down to specifics: \r\n\r\n* I've done tests several times over the last 4 years
    (including today) on different machines. I'll send you screenshots. Japanese characters
    set to 10px and 11px (or 1.0em and 1.1em within 62.5% body) are rendered identical
    in size in IE 6 and 7 (WinXP). \r\n\r\n* I spoke in pixels because they're easy
    to understand in the context of this conversation, but I set all my type in ems,
    and recommend everyone to do the same. \r\n\r\n* Re: pictures of text. Maybe \"text\"
    was the wrong word (I didn't mean body text), I don't recommend it for body copy
    of course, but I think image replacement of decently-sized static headlines is
    reasonable compromise between aesthetics and accessibility. Encoding won't help
    you when there are 2-3 decent Japanese system fonts to choose from on Mac and
    2 assey ones on Windows and they're not the same fonts. \r\n\r\nI'm not expecting
    the next Bringhurst to come out of this thread, but without any great resource
    on this specific topic (that I know of), maybe we can gather enough practical
    techniques to rise above a \"piecemeal list of greatest hits of typographic anecdotalism\".

  body: "In Russian:\r\n\r\n\xABGuillemets\xBB should be used for quotation marks,
    for a quote within a quote, it's customary to use \u201Ethis format\u201C of the
