  body: "I suspect that the clause in the EULA following:\r\n\r\n14.7.4 You may convert
    and install the font software into another format for use in other environments,
    subject to the following conditions: A computer on which the converted font software
    is used or installed will be considered as one of your Permitted Number of Computers.
    Use of the font software you have converted will be pursuant to all the terms
    and conditions of this agreement. Such converted font software may be used only
    for your own customary internal business or personal use and may not be distributed
    or transferred for any purpose, except in accordance with Section 4.4 of this
    agreement.\r\n\r\nis the portion that the FAQ is clarifying when it allows you
    to modify fonts.\r\n\r\nMaybe Thomas will drop by and add a comment. He was in
    charge when that EULA and FAQ were generated (I think)."

  body: "Looking at the FAQ with its references to \u201CPyrus FontLab\u201D and \u201CMacromedia
    Fontographer\u201D my guess is the EULA was rev\u2019d at some point but the FAQ
    was not updated. I\u2019ve mentioned the disconnect here a few times before, and
    should probably have kept quiet when the statement around Adobe allowing modifications
    came up. Right now the ambiguity is somewhat useful to customers \u2013 if Adobe
    changes anything they\u2019ll likely change the FAQ, rather than update and localize
    the font EULA, and that's probably not helpful."

  body: "Thomas has responded on this matter, to the extent that the same lawyers
    who wrote the EULA also wrote (participated in) the FAQ.\r\n\r\nI have no information,
    but consider this: The \"lawyers\" are trying to protect the monetary value of
    the fonts. That is, they are trying to protect against both piracy and unpaid
    distribution.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect of fonts though, that is, their usefulness.
    Sometime \"usefulness\" is global; that is, a blackletter font would be pretty
    useless for setting a book about romantic comedies. Just pick another font.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, a text may, for example, have 1,000 occurrences of a schwa. While
    is is possible to rotate an \"e\" 1,000 times with a layout program, it is not
    practical. An example from the PS Type 1 days was when macrons were needed over
    vowels. Just not there, and impractical to use what was in a font to typeset them.\r\n\r\nTo
    allow the end users the opportunity to use that font, you also have to allow him/her
    the right to create those characters.\r\n\r\nNow a designer may have thoughts
    other than money; they want to protect their work from any modification, on the
    ground that they got it perfect & any subsequent modification would harm their
    reputation. That is their right, but from any end-user's point of view, (1) it
    limits the usefulness of the font, and BTW (2) you can modify it's appearance
    with whatever tools the layout program has.\r\n\r\nThere aren't many end users
    on Typophile. The prevailing perspective is that of type designers. The designers
    need to remember, when talking to their lawyers about EULA's, the needs of their
    customers -- Unless, of course, they view their work as art, where the usefulness
    of it is a secondary matter.\r\n\r\nTo me, Adobe's policy make perfect sense.
    Legally, they maximize the monetary returns for the distribution of their work,
    while increasing the usefulness of it by allowing the end user to modify as needed.
    Which, as it happens, should only increase sales.\r\n\r\nIf the type world ever
    gets as serious about enforcing EULA's as the music world got, issuing lawsuits
    over modifying fonts even when there was no illegal redistribution, the management
    of companies that use fonts (that is, every press director, and I suspect the
    boss of every art director) is going to solve the  potential problem by simply
    prohibiting any the use of any font save the few known to be safe from action
    -- e.g., Adobe, as things currently stand."

    not be distributed or transferred for any purpose</STRONG>, except in accordance
    with Section 4.4 of this agreement.\"\r\n\r\nI hadn't noticed this before, but
    as section 4.4 does not allow document embedding a converted font cannot be legally
    embedded in a PDF or other document. So if somehow conversion = modification in
    Adobe's eyes, the modified font has to stay on your machine and can't be part
    of the customary PDF workflow.\r\n"

  body: "I assumed Dave\u2019s interest was primarily academic, or maybe looking for
    wording to insert into his own EULA? Reality on the ground is that the handful
    of non-typedesigner users that have invested in FontLab for production/workflow
    purposes, would have no second thoughts about violating the no-modification rules
    in order to get their work done. It\u2019s kind of like the people who remove
    the labels from mattresses or who put compact florescent bulbs in the trash -
    i this case the EULA clause is easy for them to ignore, especially if there\u2019s
    no 0% chance of getting into trouble.  "

  body: "Sorry about the perception of mixed messages. The EULA FAQ really is up to
    date. We'll take another look at tweaking either or both to make things more clear.
    It's a difficult balance to get wording that's unambiguous both to lawyers and
    end users! In the meantime, I hope this helps.\r\n\r\nIt's been Adobe's position
    - pretty much from Day 1 - that we can't be all things to all users. Therefor
    we permit our licensees to modify the fonts as/when necessary to meet their specific
    requirements. (As others have noted, this is not the case for many other companies'
    EULAs. That's largely because they want to do the modifications themselves, and
    charge for the service. Adobe fonts licensed from another company may not include
    modification permission.)\r\n\r\nThere are some obvious, and not-so-obvious constraints
    on the modified fonts. Obviously they're still subject to the terms of the end
    user license. That precludes selling or freely distributing the modified copies.
    What may be less obvious is that both the modified copies and the unmodified originals
    count toward the licensed total. (Our default license is for five seats/machines.)"
