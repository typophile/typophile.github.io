  a composed character here, a glyph deleted there, a too-small @-sign resized. I
  can't do it myself, though; I don't have the software or the skill. Nor do I know
  how to get in contact with anyone who might have the ability. Can anyone point me
  in the right direction?\r\n\r\n(P.S. There is no EULA issue with modifying it.)"
