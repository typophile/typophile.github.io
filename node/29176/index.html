  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello people!

I'm currently doing some research on [[Bruce Rogers]]'s typeface called "[[centaur]]". 
I've found plenty of information on him, the font and it's creation process.
I am now in the phase where I would like to see some visual examples where it was used. I might be wrong but I get the impression that this font isn't a really common used one.
I can imagine it's getting used on things like Movie Posters or Books, but I can't find any information on that or even more worse, visual examples. I've got some pictures of the Oxford Bible Lecture or the book "centaur" but would like to see some examples wich are on things like street signs, logos (if it was used for that), or like I mentioned before books or movie posters. I hope you know what I mean.
Could you actually give me some help and perhaps provide me with some information or examples on my issue?
I attached some digital examples of the font.

Thanks in advance!

		<div class="commentbody">Isn't Centaur mostly used as a book face? If I were you I'd head to the fiction section of a library and start looking for books that use Centaur (some books, especially those from Knopf list the typefaces used at the beginning or end of the book) and then do further research based on the publishing houses and their designers. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your advice. I don't know what centaur is used for. That's why I'm asking...
I can't look through the whole fiction section from our library to look for a book wich uses centaur (too time consuming), but the Idea with "Knopf" is pretty good. Thanks!
Anyone else?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. Do a search on abebooks.com with the keyword "Monotype Centaur". There are many inexpensive such editions, or you may find one that matches your local library.

2. American Proprietary Typefaces, by David Pankow, has an entire chapter on Centaur, and can be considered definitive. About $50, and well worth it if you're seriously interested in the field. It's also set in 14pt Monotype (metal) Centaur itself.

3. The Dover edition of Champ Fleury, by Geoffrey Tory, is a fairly good reproduction of a book set in foundry Centaur, and is also worthwhile in and of itself. Around $30. The original 1927 edition is around $500, though.

4. The Oxford Lectern Bible is set in a special version of Centaur called "Bible Centaur", produced by Monotype but not widely distributed. It has a higher x-height than the other versions. The most accessible source is the pamphlet, "An Account of the Making of the Oxford Lectern Bible," by Bruce Rogers.

5. It's very common on book covers, for the title (in digital form). You seriously can go to your local bookstore and browse, and you will find examples. Just one example off the top of my head: "Bipolar Disorder", ed. by Barbara Geller. Amazon has a clear screenshot of the cover.

Good luck! It's a wonderful font, and hopefully before too long there will be a decent digital version of it.

My main beef is the lack of optical scaling. When reproduced in offset printing, the Monotype (digital) version is way too thin and spidery at text sizes, and not as refined and calligraphic in display sizes. There are also some outlines which are kinda wonky when you look at them closely ('H'). Lastly, I also think having the Bible version available again would be cool.
