  body: And what if this was a serif face with a white stroke "eating away" the character
    shapes? The contrast looks really weird.

  body: "Hey Yves,\r\n\r\nthanks for your replies.\r\n\r\n<cite>I think this is a
    Headline optical size of a type design by Robert Slimbach</cite>\r\n\r\nThat sounded
    plausible. Something like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kepler/std-medium-disp/\">this</a>,
    right? However, I went through (most of) those fonts, and no-one was even close.
    Has Slimbach done custom faces? If so, probably not with optical sizes, did he!?\r\n\r\n<cite>And
    what if this was a serif face with a white stroke \u201Ceating away\u201D the
    character shapes?</cite>\r\n\r\nMmmh \u2026 could be. Then, this is from a leaflet
    with a rather big amount of text, all set in this font. Would be a weird idea
    to apply a stroke/outline to whole pages of body text, no? But then again, heaven
    knows, anything that\u2019s (technically) possible is getting done.\r\n\r\nStill
    clueless,\r\nF"

    using the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a> with these letters, but I'm not sure I saw the details clearly
    enough to make the right choices. Additional letterforms for things like the M,
    W, J, K, and y might help, if it was something in the fonts we have collected.\r\n\r\n-
