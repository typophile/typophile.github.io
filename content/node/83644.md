body: "I was loading my font into TextEdit (mac) and printing it. It's an OpenType
  font BTW, and TextEdit does recognize OpenType kerning. I started noticing a weird
  thing. If I was evaluating the amount of space between the letters C and a, or between
  o and f or whatever, they would change from place to place! How can I know which
  one is really an accurate representation when the letters are shifting slightly
  from left to right. Like if the word Cat is in the first paragraph, and I see that
  the C is too far from the a, Cat might also be in the second paragraph, and there
  it looks just fine, and it's the same pair of letters! Anyone else had this problem?\r\n\r\nThen
  I printed my font from Illustrator CS4 (a few paragraphs) and it did the same thing,
  as if individual letters were shifting around while it printed! So I rasterized
  the typing I had done in Illustrator and printed it and that fixed this problem.
  Is that what all you other guys do too? Any other ideas?\r\n\r\nAlso, I've noticed
  that I need to print the font at large sizes to see an accurate representation of
  it. It's a bold font, and if I make it smaller than say 20 points, it really gives
  a poor representation of it, even when I print it in just 30 percent gray (not solid
  black) to avoid bleeding of the ink on the deskjet printer I use to cause distortion.
  I'm sure I should probably use a laserjet printer, but I can't afford one right
  now, and this is a new, nice deskjet printer. This actually makes since to me. I'm
  a graphic designer and so many times I have used a font that I like on screen and
  when I print it on a deskjet it looks awful!\r\n"
