  suppose there shouldn't be since Frutiger used his number system with his fonts,
  but just to make sure is why i am asking here.\r\n\r\ncould there be problems with
  apps that wont accept this? \r\nthanks for any replies\r\nHenning"

  body: "It's perfectly legitimate to use numerals in font names, and you shouldn't
    experience any problems when doing so.\r\n\r\nPostScript allows font names to
    contain any printable non-space ASCII character (character codes 33 to 126, inclusive),
    except for the following 10 characters: \"[\", \"]\", \"(\", \")\", \"{\", \"}\",
    \"<\", \">\", \"/\", \"%\".\r\n\r\nTrueType is even more permissive than that."

  body: "There may be some constraints. If I recall correctly, the PostScript naming
    convention for printer files is the first five characters for the first part of
    a font name, but the first three for every subsequent part. For instance, the
    printer font for Fontname Extra Bold Condensed would be FontnExtBolCon.\r\n\r\nIf
    you had two fonts called Fontname2008 and Fontname2007, the printer font files
    would get the same name Fontn200. That would cause problems.\r\n\r\nI don't believe
    that OpenType has any of these restrictions.\r\n\r\nI'll leave it to Thomas or
    Karsten or someone else who understands naming issues much better than me to provide
    any correction or elaboration.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

    AFAIK there is no issue for Windows Type 1 or OpenType.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "This is then a bug in FontLab. There have always been examples of fonts with
    numbers in the PostScript FontName. The document \"Adobe Technical Note #5088
    Font Naming Issues\" at:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/font/\r\nlists the real
    PS name restrictions. Note, however, that this 1993 document covers a lot of issues
    that are not now a problem. The limit of 28 characters for Mac OS 7 is no longer
    \  a constraint, and I would no longer worry about whether the 5-3-3 naming rule
    for Mac OS 9 Type 1 printer (aka LWFN) files is sure to to generate a unique file
    name. \r\n\r\nRead"
