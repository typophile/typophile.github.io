  and body text please. Images are attached as well.\r\n\r\nI was looking at Nick
  Shinn's Scotch Modern and it looks very close to the body.\r\n\r\nThanks for all

  body: Scotch Modern it can't be because it is a new design, but it certainly was
    inspired by this kind of type. Try <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/devinne/?affid=99346">Devinne</a>.
