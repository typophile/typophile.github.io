body: hey guys, I'm new to the forums, been a fan of Typophile for a while.. I'm looking
  for constructive comments to this logo. The direction is final and I know it's a
  pretty obvious solution (the client jumped on one of the early directions. The logo
  is for a young, female independent caterer with a distinct style. She wanted something
  'groovy' and something that would set her apart from the corporate-ish caterers
  in town. The main type is based from Bookman w/ swashes and the 'from the' is hand
  drawn. Any suggestions/crits are more than welcome. thanks!

    The only thing that slightly bothers me is the kinda uneven swashy end of the
    'n' in 'Oven'.. )</em>"

  body: You've captured that early seventies look pretty well. I think it just need
    to be tightened up; smooth out the curves so everything flows nicely. There are
    some spots that need attention such as the upper right serif on the L. I would
    make the apostrophe longer; give it a more prominent tail. You might try to find
    some old photo headline type specimen catalogs for reference on how the swashes
    were done, particularly with Souvenir and Cooper Black.

  body: "I think \"from the\" gets lost between the massive main words. What do you
    think about pulling the small text out to the left so that it leads into \"Oven?\"
    It makes the logo a little less compact, but I think it gains a bit more readability
    and flow.\r\n\r\n(I'd post an example, but I can't see that attachments are allowed
    in comments. Let me know if you'd like me to email an example gif to illustrate
    what I'm saying.)\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "Nice work, the feel is spot on. To my eyes the heart sits a bit too tight
    between the L and the v. Might be problematic in low quality or small size situations.
    The position of 'from the' can be improved as well, I think.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy
    work is a game. A very serious game [M.C. Escher]"
