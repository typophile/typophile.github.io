body: "Does anybody happen to have a full sample of Adrian Frutiger's Opera, specifically
  the Italic, in sensible quality, or know where I can find one? It's not super-critical/urgent,
  but I'm curious.\r\n\r\nHere's what I know: Opera, a newspaper face, was only ever
  released for the Linotype system (by Sofratype in 1960). All three cuts (Regular,
  Italic and Bold) are monowidth. It's a bit reminiscent of Meridien, but sturdier,
  and a bit more angular/rigid. The italic is slanted-roman-ish with right-side-only
  serifs. \r\nThis is from the (rather short) section on Opera (or Op\xE9ra) in the
  Frutiger monograph:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opera-ehpa_3969.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here is a full charset:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opera-alphabet_6046.jpg]\r\n\u2026but
  it's obviously tiny and badly reproduced, so I'm curious if anyone knows where I
  might find a better one."

    or are they just a bad reproduction? If they are printed there may be hope.

  body: "Hmm, these are quick snaps from the Frutiger \"Complete Works\" monograph.
    \r\nI believe the \"\xCAhp\xE0\" sample in there is reproduced from the original
    four-page specimen from Sofratype; not sure where the other sample came from."
