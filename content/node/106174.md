  will carry out high quality research in the Human Rights (Transitional Justice)
  and Development fields and I need some help choosing a typeface to try with this
  logo.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for a typeface that gives the idea of innovation (since
  it is an innovative center), something modern/contemporary that conveys reliability,
  assertiveness, knowledge and professionalism. \r\n\r\nThe logo should make them
  look professional/serious but with a friendly and human/social feeling at the same
  time.\r\n\r\nAll suggestions are welcome.\r\n"
