body: "Hey everyone, I have not been a big font purchaser in my career. I did buy
  some in college, but I need to buy a few fonts, for a project I did, and somehow
  didn't get all the fonts, or don't already own them.\r\n\r\nI don't know who to
  buy from though, and also, do people allow downloads of zipped files as a purchase
  option, or do they always mail a CD? Because, I kind of want them by Tuesday. So...At
  the very least I need some fonts from the Goudy Old Style family, The Modern 880
  family, and the Poynter Gothic Text family.\r\n\r\nSuggestions on who to buy from,
  that would allow me to only buy what I need, and in a way that I can get them immediately?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a bunch guys, I appreciate it."

    after the transaction. This happens 24/7 so you can get what you want, when you
    want. It is very rare to see CDs mailed these days. It just doesn't pay.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Be aware that the Poynter Gothic series is not available for individual retail
    license. It is part of Font Bureau's Studio library, which is only licensed by
    contacting someone in the FB sales office directly. The Studio library fonts are
    geared towards larger publishers and require a minimum of 11 seats. \r\n\r\n"
