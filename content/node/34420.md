  Book of Ornamental Alphabet</a> by Freeman Delamotte. The following image is from
  page 49\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geosans15c_5000.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes
  it seem odd for this design to originate from the fifteenth century? Aside from
  a medieval scribe getting inspired by Roman sans inscriptions, it seems pretty unlikely
  to me. Does anyone know anything?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nOn re-examining the book,
  it appears that the figures may go with this geometric Fraktur from the British
  Museum, also dated fifteenth century.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geofrak15c_6068.jpg]"

    that someone would have caught it after the first fifteen editions. Then again,
    given the state of type scholarship at the time, maybe not. But even as a mistake,
    what is he mistaking? Not the underground type\u2014that showed up in 1916, the
    book is dated 1914. I\u2019m going to pass this one on to some of the big guns
    and while I await responses I\u2019ll start trying to track down more about and
    my Mr. Freeman Delamotte. "

  body: "Eben, I remember those, but what really strikes me is that these figures
    are from a book that appears to feature nothing but text used in manuscripts,
    so an inscription seems rather out of place. I am wondering if this might be some
    sort of gag; I did not find it in an 1859 edition in Google\u2019s collection,
    so perhaps the author was in London (Where the book was published) and was inspired
    by whatever inspired Johnston.\r\n\r\nOf course the Library of Congress has <em>none</em>
    of Delamotte\u2019s books. Maybe the Freemasons will have something..."

    a normal Roman brickstamp; looks first century AD to me. Ancient Roman lettering
    doesn't necessarily have proper serifs unless it was carved in stone, in the monumental
    style, by a professional inscription cutter, between maybe 100 BC and AD 400.
    Stamp and die cutters used all sorts of stroke terminations, including the traditional
    sans serif forms."

    seems unlikely. Nothing else in the book is remotely close to a teaching alphabet,
    so it seems odd that one would have been tossed in.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling the
    only way I\u2019m going to figure this out is to spend a lot of time tracking
    down the originals in the British Museum. So it\u2019s probably a lost cause."
