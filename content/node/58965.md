    Bold Condensed via <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/332/digigrotesk-family.html\">Linotype</a>,
    among other places. I couldn\u2019t find a website that offers the other styles
    shown on MyFonts. Try contacting <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/44/supportcontact.html\">Linotype</a>,
    or, as the \u2018EF' in the font names indicate their involvement, <a href=\"hhttp://www.fonts4ever.com/contact_us.php\">Elsner+Flake
    aka Fonts 4 Ever</a>.\r\nF"

  body: Elsner & Flake sold ripoffs of the Berthold versions of the original Hell
    fonts (made by Hell in Kiel for its CRT cathode-ray tube typesetting machine decades
    ago). Check the old EF ripoff fonts, and you will see that the glyphs of eth and
    thorn are missing.

  body: "Just for fun, I compared the font files of DigiGroteskNEF-BoldCondensed (Elsner+Flake)
    and DigiGrotesk LT BoldCondensed (Linotype), and it turned out that most glyphs
    of the Linotype font are identical with the Elsner+Flake font, except that the
    glyphs of the Linotype font had been enlarged to 118%.\r\n\r\nThat is how you
    may do it in this funny font forging industry: You enlarge (or reduce) the glyphs
    of a given font by X percent, and bingo, you may proclaim yourself the \"copyright
    owner\" of a \"newly created\" font.\r\n\r\nWho was the \"Source of the Originals\"
    in this case?"
