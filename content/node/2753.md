    target="_blank">Crash Numbering</a> which is based on the same concept.

  body: Are you going for a precise match of the letterforms, or  <BR>do you want
    to recreate the same weathered stamp feel?

    the same weathered stamp feel. Do you know any tutorials?

  body: The technique I used to use was to set the type you want as large as you can
    on a letter-sized piece of paper, then print it out on a laser printer, crumple
    it up as many times as it takes to get the distortion you want, then scan it back
    in.

  body: Ha, I&#39;ve actually seen that linked from somewhere. Maybe I googled and
    got it. It was a few months ago. Thanks. <BR> <BR>I guess you can also print out
    your type small, enlarge it on a photocopier, then scan that back in.

  body: I prefer printing it out 1:1, reduce it on a photocopier  <BR>and enlarging
    it to 1:1 again on the photocopier before  <BR>scanning it. Numerous variants
    on a single technique.

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Here&#39;s a quick &#34;tutorial&#34;
    for Photoshop I made. <BR> <BR>0. Download or make some &#34;grunge&#34; brushes
    <BR>1. Create some type on white backround. Rasterize the type. <BR>2. Use eraser
    tool with grunge brushes to wear out the text. Add some filter-&#62;distort-&#62;ripple
    and pinch/punch etc. <BR>3. Add layer effects, some white inner glow looks nice.
    Flatten the image <BR>4. Make a different image that has a paper texture. Paste
    the stamp on the background, use blend mode &#34;multiply&#34; <BR> <BR>Edit:
    Oops...I should&#39;ve thought about his a bit more, now there isn&#39;t any inking
    in the corners... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24464.jpg"

  body: Well yours is a nice method for weathering, Jan, while Yves&#39; <BR>works
    for a stamped effect. Both good for their appropriate <BR>uses.

  body: When i was student i&#39;ve find a cool method. You print your text in horizontal
    mirror on a rhodoid paper. As the ink haven&#39;t time to dry, you report it on
    a sheet. Use an ink jet printer and the result will be great. <BR>

  body: 'Bender, I use a similar technique a lot at work: I print the mirror image
    with the inkjet on the wrong &#40;glossy&#41; side of projection film and transfer
    while still wet to a blank piece of paper. <BR> <BR>Experiment a little with size
    and paper quality and you&#39;ll get very interesting stamp effects.'
