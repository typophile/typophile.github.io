  the film where there is great discussion whether Helvetica still reflects modernism
  or not, I was wondering which fonts (or font category) would present the Avant-garde
  of today.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a wine ad project where a modern font
  that sort of \"Breaks the Rules\" would be very appropriate, any ideas?\r\nThanks
  in advance."
