body: "I am hoping somebody might be able to help me. I am trying to find a script
  that I can use in FontLab that will automatically open a font, generate names from
  the Glyph/Glyph Names menu. Then save the font as a vfb, and also generate an otf
  file. Would this be a complicated time consumeing process?\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  help."

  body: This request is a little confusing. Generate names for what, i.e., for what
    reason or for what use? As what, i.e., in what format? Where, i.e., for use elsewhere
    as?

  body: "Thank you for your response.\r\n\r\nWe have an abundance of custom fonts
    that have the wrong glyph names assigned to them. When they are printed out a
    lot of the characters are out of place. They were created as an OTF font and they
    will be used in our production line. Ideally we would like the script to automatically
    open the VFB file, regenerate the glyph names, save the file and generate an OTF
    file as well. \r\n"
