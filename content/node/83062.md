  OP STAND\u2019 on the purple box, or the text along the spine, the scanner I have
  is useless and this is the best I can do. The number \u20180\u2019 seems to have
  a dot in the middle which may be custom or an element of the font, may help identifying
  it? Would really love to know what font this is, thanks for any help,\r\n\r\nDavid"
