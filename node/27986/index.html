<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I have designed fancy caps, old style figures and monostroke lowercase for !Disc Inferno display font, to be added with VOLT. Is there a standard place for putting these glyphs in the font, or just wherever I like? They are currently unmapped. Should they be mapped to a Unicode Private Use Area?
If there isn't a standard rule, what do other users do?

<div class=commentbody>They can unencoded, so long as there is a way to access them through OTL features. Since you rely on applications to expose features to users, you should try to find appropriate features among the exist OTL features as documented here:
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featuretags.htm
Old style figures, of course, should be mapped in the 'onum' feature.
Fancy caps perhaps in the 'titl' feature?
I'm not sure what you mean by 'monostroke lowercase', so can't make a guess as to what feature would be appropriate.
It is possible to define custom features in VOLT, but that won't do you much good unless you're also creating your own applications or plugins that will recognise these features.
If you think you have an idea for a feature that other font developers might find useful, I recommend writing it up, following the format of the published features, and submitting it to the OpenType discussion list for review and possible inclusion in future versions of the standard.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've OT-mapped the text figures to 'onum'. they are unmapped in Unicode.
I've also marked the the fancy caps to 'init'. Also unmapped in Unicode.
Unfortunately, MS's recommmendation is that 'init' is on by default in applications. While the fancy caps are designed to generally fit within the flow of a page, I think 'titl' is a better choice, defaulting to off. Thank you. I will likely map the lowercase letters to uppercase counterparts in the same feature, so it will really look more like a titling face.
"Monostroke lowercase" I should have referred to as monowith-stroke lowercase, like Courier. In !Disc Inferno's default style all but the line widths are consistent, except the final vertical stroke is 3x fatter. For the monostroke variant, this final line width is consistent with the others. I am planning to include this as 'ss01' for lack of a better place.
At this time I am far too naive in the world of typography to have an interest in extending the standards at all, especially when there is a serious shortage of applications taking advantage of what's already spec'ed out. Like 'rand'?
Thnaks for your feed back!

<div class=commentbody>The glyphs that are unmapped to unicode spaces are totally inaccessible in non-opentype-friendly apps? Like character map? I've got about 1300 glyphs, more than most display fonts. Can't wait to puzzle this all out.
