  body: "\"jamie\" appears to be a modified version of Caslon Graphique. All the letterforms
    are a match except for the lowercase a, which has been modified to be rounder
    at the top and to have a more teardrop terminal.\r\n\r\n\"magazine\" appears to
    be Fedra Serif A Book, though I can't be 100% sure given the small size of the
    sample image."
