    break. Try not to ID all the type you see while on vacation. ;o)

    hence have only dipped into typophile sporadically this summer. Now of course
    the pressure's off to ID since we won't get any credit for the next two weeks.
    Kidding again...\r\n\r\nEnjoy."

  body: "Hi everyone, greetings from <a href=\"http://www.nyloo.com/html/ent/792/ent.40792.1.asp\">Gregolimano</a>!
    Enjoying my last days off and looking forward to my return on my favourite Typophile
    Board. I can actually waterski now! And guess what? After all those years I finally
    managed to read a <a href=\"http://www.nologo.org/\">serious book</a>, like, with
    real paper pages 'n' stuff! :^D\r\n\r\nDavid, I've learned one thing here: IDing
    Greek type is twice as hard as the usual key glyphs (e.g. 'a', 'g', 'G' etc.)
    are absent in the Greek alphabet. Hard work! ;^P"
