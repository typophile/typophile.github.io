  body: That was a very good hint, Jesus, cryptic enough without giving too much away.
    I tried the Hungarian direction, but it didn&#39;t get me very far. Now I see
    I should have pursued it further. <BR> <BR>Congrats to Eduardo.

  body: Right under my nose here. The LA Times redesign <BR>was back in January &#40;?&#41;
    The Times introduced a <BR>new Ionic typeface for body copy and the new <BR>type
    for Section heads. <BR> <BR>But...there was never a mention of who did <BR>the
    redesign.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, I liked the letters sooo much, I started <BR>an alphabet
    resembling the section heads... <BR>never got around to any other letters. <BR>
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12354.jpg" alt="LA.jpg">
    <BR> <BR> <BR>But the G? I never saw it in a section <BR>head &#40;CALIFORNIA,
    SPORTS, CALENDAR, BUSINESS&#41; <BR>No G.  <BR> <BR>Good one Jesus! <BR> <BR>good
    job Eduardo!

    the forums or at typographi.ca. I have to admit that I don&#39;t buy <BR>the local
    paper &#40;LA Times&#41;, I read the NY Times online. <BR> <BR>I remembered that

  body: Wise words, Chesh. :-&#41; Not Charlemagne indeed. <BR>And, sorry Bj. Not
    Classica, not Priori. <BR> <BR>But, since you mentioned Barnbrook, this typeface
    has some similar details to his Mason. And it&#39;s from an one-man-foundry too.
    <BR>Keep guessing...
