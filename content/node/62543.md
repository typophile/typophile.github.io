  got all the fonts down, but I cannot figure out what these check marks are - anyone
  have any idea??  Thanks for any help!

  body: Wouldn't it be easier to just make those than look for a font that matches

  body: Zapf Dingbats has checkmarks that are close to those. Might even be what it
    is.
