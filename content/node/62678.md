    I would suggest the rendering by [[http://www.neufville.com/uk/startfuk.htm|Neufville
    Digital]] as a likely candidate.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FunMed___3577.gif]"

  body: "A lot of people seem to like Bitstream's version, which is what I use (simply
    because it comes with CorelDraw, not out of any allegiance to Bitstream).\r\n\r\nLTC's
    Twentieth Century comes with Renner's original alternates, as does Architype Renner
    if you're into that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: As far as what's the best version of Futura, [[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/090204000.html|Futura
    Serie]] without a doubt. It has small-caps and old-style figures.

  body: or try something a smidge different, like Avenir or Neutraface - both *not*
    futura but in a similar style.
