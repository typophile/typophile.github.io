  in Missouri and Ohio in the 1830s. These were printed by small printing operations
  in small communities. By looking at the paper size for different items, we can get
  a decent sense of how large the press was. One of the questions we are interested
  in, trivial as this may seem, is whether they were printing using the sheetwise
  imposition technique or using the work and turn technique. Does anyone have any
  clue how common the work and turn technique would have been in this era? Any sources
  you know of that might address the matter?

    turn\" or \"work and tumble.\" Are you asking how common perfecting presses were,
    or which technique was most common with single head press?\r\n\r\nWhen I started
    typesetting books in the 1980s, single head presses for books with a print run
    of 1,000-2,000 copies were quite common."

  body: Thanks for your reply, Charles. For sure they did not have a perfecting press.
    What I am getting at is whether they would have used the sheetwise imposition
    technique, meaning they printed the front of the sheet on the front, then removed
    and dried the sheet and changed the plate, after which they turned over the sheet
    and printed the back. Or instead, using "work and turn," would they have printed
    some front sides and some back sides on the front of the sheet, then turned the
    sheet over and, without changing the plate, finished the job.

    pages, since the sheet would contain two identical sets of pages. They would have
    been cut before folding into signatures.\r\n\r\nIf separate plates were used,
    then you\u2019d likely find signatures of twice as many pages.\r\n\r\nSo, if you
    have a sense of the size of press and sheet size, and you can count out the pages
    in a folded signature, you should be able to answer your own question. Yes?\r\n\r\n"

  body: From all we know, it does seem they used the work and turn method, but we
    were hoping, as a sort of "check" on our thinking, to get a sense of how common
    the method was in that era.
