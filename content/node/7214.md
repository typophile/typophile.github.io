body: This font is still very much in the rough stages. I&#39;m still playing with
  some of the letterforms. The letters were drawn and scanned in, then fontified using
  Font Creator Program. &#40;I know, I know, but new computer first, then I see about
  new software.&#41; Some resizing is possible, but beyond minor deformation, the
  letter needs to be redrawn. Let me know what you think. Help on spacing would be
  good, too. I&#39;m having trouble making it work with the oblique letters. &#40;From
  this sample, I see the y has too much space on the right. &#42;sigh&#42;&#41; <BR>

  body: Will you keep the &#34;hand-drawn&#34; quality of it? I think you should.
    I like the &#34;squareness&#34; of it as well. Maybe it shouldn&#39;t be cleaned
    up too much? Maybe this could become another super-opentype font with all kinds
    of alternates? Really enjoy the n and the z and the g and the w and the Q ...

  body: Yes, I&#39;m keeping the hand-drawn aspect. I&#39;ve printed samples of this
    off, and I was surprised at how much it looked like I&#39;d lettered the page.
    &#40;Dumb, but it&#39;s what happened.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve already got some
    ligatures drawn - but not fontified - as well as all the capital letters. Terminal
    letters too, so that, for example, that <b>r</b> isn&#39;t going to necessarily
    reach across toward the next word. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t, however, have the ability
    to make an OT font. Everything I produce is open source though, so interested
    third parties could take my glyphs and build their own. <BR> <BR>Watch this space.

  body: Progress after one month or so. <BR> <BR>The spacing is fixed for the basic
    characters, accented characters have been added, as well as some of the ligatures
    and some of the terminals. The leaf graphic there will be the bullet, too. <BR>
