  painting class at The Cooper Union in mid March.  This class will be open to the
  public.  The class has a very limited capacity so if you'd like to attend it would
  be wise to book early.  \r\n\r\nGet more info or sign up [[http://cooperunion.augusoft.net/index.cfm?method=ClassInfo.ClassInformation&int_class_id=647&int_category_id=2&int_sub_category_id=19&int_catalog_id=0|here.]]\r\n\r\nThere
  is a nice article on John's work on a shopfront in Brooklyn on Hannes Famira's [[http://www.typedu.org/dynamic/blog/signpainter|blog]],
  the source of the image below.\r\n\r\nJohn Downer is a sign painter by trade, with
  a specialty in gold leaf lettering. He has a B.A. in Fine Art from Washington State
  University and both an M.A. and an M.F.A. in Painting from The University of Iowa.
  He began his career as a freelance type designer in 1983. Mr. Downer writes about
  type and type history for Emigre magazine, House magazine, and other publications.
  He lives in Iowa City, and travels widely in the United States and Europe, always
  on the lookout for interesting letterforms. His digital type has been released through
  Emigre Fonts, Inc., The Font Bureau, Bitstream Inc., Design Lab, Inc., and House
  Industries.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JohnDowner_12_6654.jpg]"

  body: "I wish I could attend this. For those of you who are serious about lettering
    or font design this is a class that you do not want to miss. True Sign Painters
    are hard to find these days. John Downer is truelly a Master Sign Painter. I have
    taken private lessons with John and I was impressed not only with his manipulation
    of letters with the brush but his vast knowledge of lettering and font design.\r\n\r\nI
    highly recommend this and truelly wish I could attend this class. If you have
    the means then you would be wise to attend.\r\n\r\n"

    shop at 420 North Fairfax in Los Angeles, in the historic Fairfax District. Directly
    across from Canter''s delicatessen. If you have never seen gold leaf lettering
    being done, stop by and chat with John. He''s always very enthusiastic about glass
    gilding. '
