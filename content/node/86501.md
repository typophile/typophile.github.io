  charge of designing a website for a friend, who has had the attached logo designed
  for him. I'd like to create headers for the website using the same font, but when
  he asked the designer, she claimed it was Rockwell. It's clearly not, right?\r\n\r\nAny
  help you can provide would be amazing as the logo designer is not being particularly
  helpful!\r\n\r\nThanks again, Matt.\r\n\r\n"
