  BETA site]] yesterday.  Interestingly, there is a very nice general tightening up
  of the brand across the board, and they are utilizing Trade Gothic Extended quite
  prominently.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if any code ninjas could let us know how they are
  pulling this off ?"

    from fonts.com</a>. \r\n\r\nHere's a little geekier info from their <A href=\"http://webfonts.fonts.com/en-US/support/FAQ\">web
    fonts FAQ</a>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<strong>In what format is the font data transmitted
    for which browser?</strong>\r\nFont data may be transmitted in EOT, WOFF, SVG
    or TrueType\xAE formats. The font format that is served is dependent upon the
    visitor\u2019s browser. \r\n\r\n<strong>How is the font data delivered?</strong>\r\nFont
    data is deployed globally across a Content Distribution Network (CDN). When someone
    visits your Web font enabled Web site, the font data that you\u2019ve licensed
    and implemented (using the Fonts.com Web Fonts portal) on that page will be delivered
    to the visitor's temporary browser cache. It will remain there until the visitor's
    browser session has ended, at which time it will automatically be removed from
    their system.\r\n</blockquote>"
