body: I just picked up Josef Muller-Brockman&#39;s &#34;Grid systems in graphic design&#34;
  I&#39;ve read it and I understand the principles I think.  <BR> <BR>But its just
  trying to transfer them over to layout programs such as quark or in design  <BR>
  <BR>Are there any modern books out there which approach the design of the grid as
  in depth as Muller-Brockman&#39;s book? but show you how to design and construct
  the grid within in-design  <BR>or quark?  <BR> <BR>cheers

  body: Jamie, the best thing you can do is not take it all too literally. The grid,
    in design, is simply the structure or the bones, of any given project.  <BR> <BR>By
    laying down any set of guides on a master page in either quark or indy these guides
    transfer themselves to all of the other pages. You can set up multiple master
    pages to be used in different ways and different things. For instance, you can
    set up a left-hand page set of guides and a right-hand set of guides that set
    forth the &#34;rules&#34; or &#34;guides&#34; by which you lay certain text blocks
    down. If you look at some of the better designed magazines out there &#40;IMHO&#41;
    you can see that the feature articles have different grids followed compared to
    the lead-in articles. Living &#40;formerly Martha Stewart Living&#41; has such
    rules ... rhymnes and reasons for everything right down to how many points apart
    the pictures are placed.  <BR> <BR>On the master pages you can also set up page
    numbers, footers and headers, rules, etc. <BR> <BR>Does any of this start to answer
    your questions?

  body: I own Brockmans book and also looking to get the making and breaking the book
    that Tiffany mentioned. <BR> <BR>But I would definitely recommend the Willi Kunz
    book, I have both of his books and they are really good, not too text heavy with
    a lot of experiments, and images to illustrate his points.

    have to check out making and breaking the grid-ive heard good things about it,
    I think I&#39;m just getting confused with all the mathmatics, em&#39;s picas,ciceros,
    cm etc, trying to construct it Brockmans way becuase he&#39;s so precise...and
    I just need to practice constructing a few more grids.'

    Raster. The typographic grid&#34;, Verlag Niggli AG, 2000, ISBN 3-7212-0340-2.
    The text is both german and english. It consists of about 130 pages of examples

  body: Judging from the response Jamie, you have many excellent suggestions so I
    don&#39;t wish to repeat anything already mentioned but would like to say that
    &#34;typography&#34; even in context of the grid system will never reach its full
    potential if tackled as a &#34;technique&#34;, still less a &#34;formula&#34;.
    So if you are bitten by the grid bug as I was many years ago when I bought many
    books &#40;Mueller Brockman, Armin Hoffman etc&#41; and discovered for myself
    the truth of the statement &#34;Less is More&#34; and also the fact that &#34;Simple
    Design&#34; is far more difficult than cluttered and overdone design &#40;I&#39;m
    NOT describing Emigre, Neville Brody, David Carson kind of stuff which I love&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>So instead of looking for &#34;how to design a grid within Quark or InDesign&#34;
    &#40;that is not difficult&#41; I would suggest - try to understand the principles
    better, see more examples of how different designers have stretched the grid system
    &#40;Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman&#41; or amazingly made it look as if it
    is no limitation at all to design the most inspiring &#40;opposed to mechanical
    and cold as SWISS typography is often accused of being&#41;work in the Grid System
    as shown by Helmut Schmid who studied  under Emile Ruder and now lives in Japan
    ... his work shows &#34;that you don&#39;t have to abandon the grid to design
    something that can be poetic, warm, inspiring as well as &#34;unpredictable&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>Sorry if you find this response too lengthy. I&#39;m posting here for the
    first time. <BR> <BR>Sujit Patwardhan <BR>Pune, India

  body: Just study classic examples of great design. What&#39;s aligning, and where.
    See Proportions. See Spaces. Learn from the masters - you so need to build on
    a skeleton/basis and understanding of good classic design in order to develop
    your own style. Observe good design and layout wherever you see it. Stop and take
    note of why it is special. So much of good/great design is based on acute observation
    and study and awareness. That&#39;s what it boils down to, in the end, IMHO. There&#39;s
    no magic formula. I think many people recongnise well-considered and inspired
    design when they see it, even if only subconsciously. It just looks &#42;amazing&#42;.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m only learning now after some 20 years in design &#40;as a 3rd generation
    artist and designer in my family&#41; that &#34;to study design - study type.&#34;
    I would only add &#34;classic type&#34;. Nothing is as sublime as the lessons
    of space and line and proportion that observing beautiful type can teach you.
    You will continue to learn from it all your life. It never stops - how wonderful.
    <BR> <BR>all the best,  <BR> <BR>Kaisa

  body: Rafael,  have you read Kimberly Elam&#39;s other book on geometry in design?  I
    think it&#39;s a nice companion to Grid systems.  That and Bringhurst,  typographic
    style seems to a little bit of everything, but never skims the surface. <BR> <BR>Sujit,  &#34;Less
    is more&#34; everytime I hear that it means something new to me. Good advice.

  body: It should be noted, of course, (though this will come as news to few or no
    regulars here) that it is 12 <strong>Didot</strong> points that one Cicero equals,
    the Didot point being larger than the point used in the English-language world
    by roughly the ratio of 15 to 14, or, more closely, the ratio of 77 to 72.
