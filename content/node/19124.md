body: "Take a look at Dan's announcement for his soon-to-be-released face \"Mountain\"
  at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typeoff.de/?p=44\r\n\r\nI just looked at Mountain.  Mountain
  has a constructivist base with a blackletter flavor--which does not surprise me
  considering Dan's affinity for blackletter:-)  I quite like the cap D in particular.
  \ I think Mountain's italic is quite successful and may find its way into some metal
  band logos.\r\n\r\nExcellent work Dan!  \r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Mountain is not for sale yet, but it will appear soon with [[Volcano Type]],
    and the link Chris posted will be updated to include more info about that when
    it happens.\r\n\r\nA trial version of Mountain is bundled with the book <a href=\"http://www.bastard-project.com\">Bastard:
    Choose My Identity</a>. That is a beautifully book which I can heartily recommend.
    I just received copy from the designers today."

  body: I think Chris is right. I can see it being used in a wide variety of applications,
    sort of like Papyrus is used to show futuristic, ancient, and anything in between
    (I hope you take that as the compliment it was intended to be. It's obviously
    nothing like Papyrus at all.).

    faces that draw on geometric nouveau and deco influences.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.atelierreneknip.nl/\r\n\r\nCheck
    out his book, A.R.K./A.B.C., too."

  body: Yes, I am familiar with his work. Beautiful stuff. I first learned about it
    at TYPO-Berlin last year. That A.R.K. lettering looks cool the same way that Chris'
    Weimar Plakat 1923 face looks cool, and seems to share some of the same inspiration,
    although Chris' letters are darker and less wide.
