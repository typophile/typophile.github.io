body: "I'm curious to hear thoughts and opinions on the mixing of upper and lowercase
  characters in a logotype. I've always referred to this as \"intercase\" or \"mixedcase\"
  and have never came across a formal or correct name. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the first mark
  that comes to mind is what Target did for Giada De Laurentiis. I'm on the fence
  with this one, from a purists standpoint it's awful, from a progressive viewpoint,
  it's interesting and kind of nice. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? "

  body: Unicase is another moniker; right or wrong, it's different enough to get noticed,
    which I suppose is the whole point...

    it\u2019s a great idea. Just don\u2019t leave it up to some hack who thinks that
    randomly tweaking bits of letters is logo design."

  body: "I agree with the above comments. I think it's an interesting concept, I think
    it definitely makes you think \"what the...?\" I think it makes sense when a company
    is unlike it's competitors or wants to be seen as mold-breaking or different.
    \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, here is a concept I'm working on for a client that
    is modernizing, and unlike any in it's sector. They want to convey that, yet look
    serious, and corporate-clean. \r\n\r\nI'm doing it with a san-serif. Screen resolution
    is making some of the vertical strokes appear different, I can assure you the
    I's are the same widths, and are the same width as the middle crossbar on the
    lowercase e. \r\n\r\nFeel free to critique my kerning and character widths. I'm
    thinking the P could be a little wider. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sapientiaunicase_5199.png]\r\n\r\n"

    has a good pedigree, going back to uncials.\r\nIt was formalized intellectually
    by Bradbury Thompson, a well-respected designer, as <a href=\"http://www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/alpha.html\">Alphabet
    26</a>.\r\n\r\nThe sample you show is set in Filosofia, one of many types that
    has a unicase option.\r\nThe modern/didone style has proved to be quite suitable
    for unicase (I included it in the display cut of Scotch Modern).\r\n\r\nMy unicase
    type system: <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/panoptica.html\">Panoptica</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Those letters seem awfully light for use as a logo. As you\u2019ve already
    found out those strokes won\u2019t render evenly on screen, and you\u2019ll have
    similar problems any time it gets printed small on laser or inkjet printers. That
    said I think that your design is strong but the spaces between P and I and N and
    T are too wide. The S might need to be a little wider to balance it against the
    wide minuscules and the big air gap to the left of it."

  body: The Winebar is a classic example of the hack category. Someone simply scaled
    capitals down to the x-height and didn't notice or care that the weights are now
    mismatched.

  body: Agreed - the "WINEBAR" logotype is awful. Especially bad choice to use Bodoni,
    a face that is predicated on equal proportions in the variation of stroke width.
    I feel unicase type is tough to execute with any face that has that much variation.
    Lowercase was not designed to have the same x-height as uppercase so you can't
    just mash them together and call it a day - requires some finesse. Plus some balance
    is needed perhaps equal or close to equal number of upper v. lower characters
    would help keep the balance.

    I remember the story correctly, he told Steve Jobs that he would present only
    one concept -- take it or leave it -- and his fee would be $100,000 (although
    that amount covered the entire identity system, not just the logo itself)."
