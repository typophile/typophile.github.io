  E-like, &-like symbol online, and I was wondering what this symbol means and what
  typography it is.\r\n\r\nI am thinking it is one of H&FJ typography, but note sure.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know what symbol and font this can be!?\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you very much
  for your time and kindness :)."

  body: If you study fonts, you'll find lots of ampersands like this, mostly in italic
    faces. Considering that the ampersand represents "et", the more common one that
    looks like a figure-8 is the weirder one, where the original letters are almost
    completely hidden.

  body: "To complete the circle, \"et\" is latin for and, which was touched on by
    Nick Cooke above.\r\n\r\nIf you really want a freak out, check out the ampersand
    in Rotis!"
