<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I really enjoyed the "Most Overused" thread, and Keith volunteered a most underused face. What do you think is a type that has been ignored? The most underused or overlooked type... and I'd like you to pick (at least) two: one from the last five years or so, and one older than that, preferably 10 years old or more. <br> <br>Thanks, <br> <br>Troy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Antique Olive Nord by Roger Excoffon (1962) <br>Gill Sans by Eric Gill (1929 ish) <br> <br>I notice that Gill Sans turned up in the most overused font thread too. Whenever I see anything trying to evoke a 1930s feel (which is quite a lot at the moment), they always use a font with Deco in its name. Some of these fonts are nice, but they're much less common in real objects from the 30's than you would think. From 1935 Gill Sans was used for the Penguin book covers which epitomise good quality 1930's design and (because they were in every house right up to recent years) really bring out that time period in the mind of almost everyone over 20. (In the UK at least - don't know if they are the same in the US). <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Charter by Matthew Carter? I really love this type... a very elegant workhorse type and works well in low and high resolution. Now that's quite an achievement. It's really underused. I use it quite a lot myself. <br> <br>I think I mentioned this somewhere else already. <br> <br>I'll think of some other ones... <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

Parsimony Press, 1993. <br> <br>I agree with Keith about Charter who can be a very good newspaper face among others of its qualities. Because of this situation, I recommended it for the Belgium newspaper Le Soir couple of years ago -- They use is everyday now. <br> <br>The list came in mind include: <br>Icone, Times Europa, Hoefler Text, ITC Bodoni, FF Balance, Souvenir, <br>and yes, most of Poppl faces too.</div>

<div class=commentbody>What goes around comes around. For decades Plantin was a dreadfully overused face; now it is undeservedly neglected. CUP use it for some law books where it works well, in a setting that demands conservatism (mostly Times, or Sabon which seems to be the new Times for law texts). For decades Gill was underused, and now it's both overused and badly used, at least here in the UK: the EasyJet adverts are dreadful -- but the new Church of England 'Common Worship' book is rather fine. <br> <br>I'd say that pretty much all modern post-1980 text faces (with the exception of Minion and maybe FF Scala) are more or less underused, at least in books. Everyone using weedy looking grey Bembo with chubby semibold and half the ligatures missing ...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Vectora is around here in the States, in certain pockets of use. It was used to great effect for a few years in <i>Critique</i> magazine, where I was first introduced to it. I used it extensively in the program guide for a yoga/wellness center several years ago, shortly after which, it was picked up by Yoga Journal (I like to think my use influenced them, though it may have just been coincidence). I seem to remember seeing it picked up in another, more mainstream magazine recently, but I can't recall which offhand. <br> <br>There are a handful of books in production for the publisher I work with which are using Vectora as the sans-serif for secondary elements. <br> <br>But, thankfully, it is far from overexposed. It's a great face, very sturdy and serviceable. The one drawback is that the excessive x-height can make it tricky to mix with other faces. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>That's pretty funny. Found it in a nineteenth-century German dictionary once as "Boy-child" (archaic). The citizens of the Swiss city Biel are known as Bielers. <br> <br>But it is only common in the northeastern shore area of Wisconsin as a slang word for young boys. My dad defined it as "a boy who has his own mind about how he does things." I was the bieler of the family. When I started my press it seemed as good a name as any. <br> <br>Just to stay on topic, I should set it in the inglorious Mrs Eaves once. </div>

<div class=commentbody>The best part about Mrs. Eaves: <br> <br>The client comes to you and says, <i>We think <br>the type is looking a little small (so is the logo <br>by the way) could you 'up the font'?</i> <br> <br>You get to say, <i>Great!

<div class=commentbody>My information might be outdated. It had something to do with -intentionally- not having a representative in the US. As for getting specimens, TEFF* is indeed highly gracious. Did you notice the paper they use for the specimens? Wow. But note that I said "and/or". I remembered at least <i>one</i> of them not selling [directly] to the US - it could have been DTL and not TEFF. <br> <br>* And DTL provides all you need in PDFs online. <br> <br>> intention <br> <br>I can't be sure, but maybe it has to do with higher rates of piracy and/or lack of copyright protection. Basically it's a matter of <i>controlling</i> the dissemination of your product, and that goes hand in hand with: <br> <br>> I don't understand how the high prices make economic sense. <br> <br>Well, the price point of something depends on many things, and in a niche market for example higher prices will yield greater profits. I think in this case higher prices do two things: elevate the prestige of the foundry above the seething masses, "justifying" future [high] pricing; reduce the rate of piracy (not just by reducing dissemination, but also because the more you pay for something the less likely you'll share it). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>"DTL was distributed in the US, at least for a short while, by FontHaus back in 1996." <br> <br>Interesting. DTL must have been a bit problematic but this would seem to indicate that they hardly "intentionally" avoided US distribution. I checked my DTL fonts, and five of them, marked 1994 indicate receipt from Monotype Typography, and two more, marked 1995 seemingly came from the old URW. These were sent for review and I remember having trouble at the time because I could not get any literature on them that was written in English. Monotype didn't provide any and I can't read Dutch. And DTL would not respond to my inguiries.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do find it weird, given the great quality of their types, that DTL doesn't use any other European language in the web site (except for the 'shop'.) I could manage with French or German, and of course English, but who knows Dutch except the Dutch? <br> <br>Also, they have promised a digital version of Romulus - the most beautiful roman typeface ever IMHO - in a few months hence for over two years. That I can easily understand. It's the pricing I don't.

<div class=commentbody>I believe the thinking is that they sell fonts in the Netherlands to people who are willing to pay real money for fonts and want to use Dutch ones.
