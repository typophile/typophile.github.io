body: "Does anyone know of and recommend any schools with typography programs in Texas?
  \r\n\r\nI live in Austin, TX and my addiction to type design grows stronger every
  day. Problem is, I have no formal education on the subject. Books have been a lot
  of help, but I would really like to take some classes or in some way learn from
  someone more learned than I.\r\n\r\nAlso, are there any Texas based type foundries
  or studios that perhaps I could look into?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for any information
  you can provide,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    UT's online course listings it didn't look like they had any type specific classes.
    Browse being the operative word there, I may have missed something...?\r\n\r\nDid
    you attend UT, mnot?"

  body: UT would be your best bet....they have the strongest program in Texas.  Other
    than that, you should look at Reading in London, or if you want a closer option....you
    could try to move close to some american type foundries and pray for an internship.

  body: I realize this was almost one year ago, but I live in Louisiana and hear good
    things about University of North Texas from time to time. I attend Northwestern
    State University of Louisiana, and can't <em>not</em> recommend it enough. Not
    that the professors are bad, but the rest of the faculty is simply out-and-out
    useless if you ever have a problem that it is their job to solve (which you will,
    because they are completely inept.)

  body: I'm from Texas, and I would say UNT (University of North Texas) would be your
    best bet. It's one of the strongest design schools in Texas. If you ask me, a
    lot of their work can be very expected and redundant, but the type is usually
    handled very well. It's in Denton, a small town near Dallas, which has a very
    strong design community. Not too terribly far from Austin. Good luck!

  body: Unless you're talking about designing typefaces. Then, I'm not sure even UNT
    would have something for you. Hmmm I can't think of any programs in Texas. Again,
    good luck.
