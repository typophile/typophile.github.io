  body: 'Every time I walk by a WaMu I''m amazed this typeface was given the thumbs
    up by a national bank. <em>Any</em> committee, really -- be it design, administrative,
    or executive -- that approved this must have been asleep or incompetent. It doesn''t
    exactly inspire confidence in an institution. '

  body: kerning aside, this does seem like an interesting use of a 'bad' font in a
    nice way. Certainly adds some character.

  body: "In this case, \"amateurish\" might be a bit subjective. I'd agree that the
    typesetting appears amateurish, but I could see arguments for the typeface choice
    going off the 'difference' tagline.\r\n"

    a live trace.

  body: "It's slop. A clumsy mix of maybe Garamond and Futura with poor decisions
    (if any were consciously made) about which pieces of each style to use. Even in
    the context of the grunge era it is bad. Stephen Farrell did better stuff, notably
    Flexure.\r\n\r\nThe typesetting doesn't save it either. The layout is thoughtless
    scatter and they didn't even bother to use a proper apostrophe."

    Road]], a Washington State ad firm for a long time, and I would imagine the wall
    graphics in the above photo were produced during the Sedgwick Years. \r\n\r\nWaMu
    was also one of the worst offenders for selling no-income no-asset home loans
    during the past few years, but will inevitably get an idiotic government bailout
    that keeps all of their profit in the hands of private investors, and funnels
    them billions of taxpayer dollars. Sorry to veer into politics, but you could
    say that typeface is a great metapohric foreshadowing of the broken and imbalanced
    banking they engaged in for the past few years."

    and the weak qualities of the face, and thought about posting it here.  I don't
