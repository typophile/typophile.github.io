body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI have found a typeface used in a book title that I
  liked. The book was printed around 1930. I thought I would create a font for those
  Archaic Romanian letters. Below is the source.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sursa_6277.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
  the letters tat were missing I had to create them myself. I would like to know your
  oppinion.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plansa arhaic cali 2_5599.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  red letters are my creation.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think.\r\n\r\nI also
  have another font preview and requesting critique here:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/55517]]"

  body: "That's one hell of a font :) Looks like a folk dance!\r\n\r\nI think it looks
    really interesting, and pretty weird too. Good job! Some characters that still
    need a little work imo are the M, N and H: I think they might still be a bit too
    stiff and straight to fit with the others. The curve on the N is nice, but I the
    heavy vertical lines and the slab serifs may be a bit too ordinary. You might
    want to experiment a little more with that.\r\n\r\nA problem of a different order
    are the U and V. They look really nice, but it's hard to recognise them, especially
    the U. Maybe there is another solution to distinguish these characters be keep
    them readable.\r\n\r\nDo you want to use this font for anything in particular?
    It would be interesting to see this font in use! \r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

  body: "Hm, very interesting. I haven't seen anything like this before and I wonder
    where the caligraphy evolved from?\r\n\r\nI especially like the A and L. I think
    your K and S work really well. I'm not sure the tight curves on N fit with the
    rather lemon-shaped curves of the other glyphs and I think it could be wider.
    Z seems to need more weight. I wonder if Y could have a tail like on the L? Would
    O and Q work with a dot in the middle (like your full-stop)? I'm not sure about
    the tail on Q. U looks like a non-Latin glyph.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello Queneau,\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments.\r\nI forgot to mention
    this is work in progress and only a first draft so I agree there are thinks to
    improve. That's why I need your oppinion. \r\nI will adjust them and get back
    with the results.\r\n\r\nIf you like these kind of Archaic Romanian typefaces
    you can see more on my blog at:[[http://florinf.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/arhaic-romanesc/]].
    Those were already created as fonts and are available for free on some free fonts
    sites.\r\n\r\nThese fonts are hard to use because of their connection to a specific
    time in Romanian history but still they are currently used on books related to
    Orthodox church, Romanian history and tradition, Romanian greeting cards and so
    on. They are all just a narrow niche. I don't know if they could be useful for
    something else.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comment."

  body: "Hello Bendy,\r\n\r\nYou are right. These was a time in romanian history when
    all the books were written in slavonic language with chyrilic letters. Later only
    the letters were used although romanian language normally uses Latin letters.
    So they became a sort of decorative typefaces that have a certain historic and
    traditional feel.\r\n\r\nI will try your suggestions and come back with the corrections.\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much for your comment.\r\n\r\nPlease check and critique my other font,
    not inspired by the Old Romanian typefaces.\r\nIt's called Friends and is entirely
    my creation [[http://typophile.com/node/55517]]"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI think the N, M & H are certainly better. I like the quirky serifs!
    The new open U is also better, though it still is a difficult character to recognise.
    The O with dot looks nice too, but I would try to differentiate a bit more between
    the O and the Q. Maybe you could try to remove the bottom serif of the Q, or build
    the foot (or whatever you call the little thingy on the Q) from the serif. It's
    a bit too subtle now, IMO. The new Y with tail is also very nice, it's a keeper!
    \r\n\r\nThe one thing I would now try is to implement the new serifs in all letters
    (also in the black originals), I think it's okay if you deviate a bit from your
    example, if it makes a better font.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

  body: "Wow, MNO look great! I'm especially pleased with M. Looks like it a lowercase
    m in disguise. \r\nI think CEGOQ need to be taller: even though you have based
    them on the existing ones, they seem to be much shorter because of the shapes.\r\nU
    is still a difficult shape. On your blog, the second picture has an interesting
    U shape but it's still recognisable; perhaps you could do something similar? (But
    I really like the point on the bottom of your existing one)\r\nI think the dots
    work well in O and Q. But I think the Q needs a much fancier tail. Q doesn't appear
    in any of the alphabets on your blog, I assume there was no need for Q in those
    days. So you have a lot of freedom to invent something new.\r\nX troubles me slightly.
    The curved crossbar seems quite heavy but then narrows into the terminals when
    normally the opposite would be true. I think it's worth playing with the contrast
    of both strokes and even perhaps making both of them curves instead of one straight?\r\nI
    wonder what a lowercase would feel like for this. It would be very exciting to
    invent one I think :)\r\n\r\nThere are some lovely images on your blog btw. I
    really like the photoshop-calligraphy images. \r\n"

  body: "This is really interesting and something I haven't seen before, and I find
    your blog fascinating as well.\r\n\r\nI actually would recognize your first U
    better than your second U, familiar as I am with the form as the Greek ou ligature,
    also used in early Cyrillic. Consider your audience; if this design is intended
    for those who are already familiar with early Romanian letterforms, then don't
    be afraid to use shapes that they would expect. You can offer more familiar forms
    as alternates for the sake of outsiders, but I hope you don't abandon traditional
    shapes entirely because those not versed in the tradition have trouble recognizing
    them."

  body: "First of all I want to thank you all.\r\nVery usefull comments.\r\n\r\nI
    think I will post the Slavonic alphabet that was used in Romania so you can see
    the letter shapes. They used to write in slavonic and used these letters and later
    wrote in romanian with some adapted letters (like the latin alphabet, romanian
    language is using latin letters). After 1860 only latin letters were used. These
    old letter shapes were scarcely used, mostly in orthodox / religious books.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01-arhaic-romanesc-gri_5167.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    is a sample of a manuscript.\r\nThe printed books have similar lettershapes.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12_3644.jpg]\r\n\r\nThen

    comment. Thank you very much.\r\nI am trying to adjust the shapes so that they

    XIX.\r\n\r\nThank you."
