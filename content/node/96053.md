  body: "The nameplate of the  Detroit Free Press, like those of most other newspapers,
    is a unique custom design, most likely with no other characters available. I believe
    that this one was created by Jim Parkinson.\r\n [[http://typedesign.com/logos/detroit.html|DetroitFreePressNameplateInProgress]]\r\nIt
    has had many different versions over the years."
