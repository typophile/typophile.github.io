  New York Times Style magazine (Spring 2009). The \"G\" looks like Alternate but
  the \"R\" is different. I like the \"R.\"\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you
  know of any nice tall, condensed fonts like this, please let me know. \r\n\r\nThank
  you :)\r\n\r\n-Julia[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eurostars_5890.jpg]"

    be one of Dennis Ortiz-Lopez highly condensed Gothics.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "MyFonts shows almost 1200 'narrow' fonts, in case you are looking for almost
    any variation of sans or serif styles that fit that general description. I scrolled
    through all of them, and didn't see an exact match in the bunch, although many
    seemed similar in at least a few details. I thought BA Graphics had a couple of
    fairly similar styles, including a light weight sans that was fairly close. The
    medium weight style I thought was close was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/headline-gothic/|Headline
    Gothic]], and the light one was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/title-gothic-light/|Title
    Gothic Light]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
