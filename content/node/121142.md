      think the ban on lookup types in features where they're not specified only applies
      to substitutions that take or return the wrong number of glyphs? Or does it
      mean you also can't do contextual substitutions where only non-contextual are
      specified, or non-contextual where contextual are specified? There are places
      where bending the rules would be handy even for basic stuff: for instance, contextual
      substitutions in <code>locl</code> for Catalan punt volat; one-to-many in <code>smcp</code>
      for decomposing germandbls.smcp to s.smcp.DEU s.smcp.DEU; and many-to-one in
      <code>salt</code> or <code>ss01</code> for replacing s.smcp.DEU s.smcp.DEU with
      germandbls.smcp.alt."

  body: "It is my understanding that the  cursor never goes backwards (though contextual
    rules allow looking at left contexts). \r\n\r\nIf you have many substitution rules
    in a lookup, it is my understanding that the first that matches is applied. If
    you have many lookups they are applied in a row. So if the string is ab and the
    first lookup says to replace a by b and b by c, then you will endup with bc because
    the first rule matches a and will replace a by b and then the cursor moves forward
    one position and then the second rules applies for b. If you have a first lookup
    that replaces a by b and a second lookup that remplaces b by c, then a will be
    replaced by b by the first lookup and then b by c by the second lookup and then
    the cursor will move forward one position to the second character and then the
    second lookup will replace b by c to give cc as a result. If your first lookup
    replaces b by c and the second replaces a by b, then on ab the first lookup does
    nothing on a and the second replaces it by b and then the cursor moves to the
    second glyph that is replaced by c; the resulting string is bc. \r\n\r\nI tried

    body: "Thanks Michel. The [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#7.a|Adobe
      Feature File spec]] says the cursor does go back with each lookup: \"each lookup
      corresponds to one 'pass' over the glyph run\". You can prove it by giving a
      string of 'a's to the following code, which returns not 'i's, as it would if
      the layout engine went through all lookups before moving on to the next glyph,
      but 'j's:\r\n<pre>sub a by b;\r\nlookup proof {\r\n  sub b' a by i;\r\n  sub
      b' b by j;\r\n} proof;\r\n</pre>That's why I expected <code>lookup DoesntReRun;</code>
      at the end of my second example to send the cursor back to the start, turning
      all the new 'b's produced by <code>sub a by b;</code> into 'c's. The following
      code does do what I'd expected, despite using only lookup calls rather than
      definition-and-execution in place: <pre>\r\nlookup sub_a {\r\n  sub a by b;\r\n}
      sub_a;\r\nlookup sub_b {\r\n  sub b by c;\r\n} sub_b;\r\nfeature xxxx {\r\n
      \ lookup sub_a;\r\n  lookup sub_b;\r\n} xxxx;</pre>\r\n\r\nBut now I've noticed
      something else odd: the last piece of code does exactly the same thing if you
      swap the order of the lookup calls, but changes its behaviour if you swap the
      order of the lookup <em>definitions</em>. Specifically, given a string of 'a's,
      it returns 'b's instead of 'c's. This language is weird."

    one are copied in written order to the top of the feature's code.</cite>\r\n<cite>2)
    All lookup calls themselves are then deleted.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect.
    To understand what's going on you need to understand that the GSUB table within
    a font is a set of ordered lookups, and that feature tags simply indicate a set
    of lookups which are to be applied when that feature is active. To illustrate
    this, consider the following:\r\n\r\nfeature xxxx {\r\n    sub a by b;\r\n    sub
    x by y;\r\n    lookup lookupA {\r\n        sub c by d;\r\n    } 1ookupA;\r\n}
    xxxx;\r\n\r\nfeature yyyy {\r\n    sub a by c;\r\n    lookupA;\r\n} yyyy;\r\n\r\nThe
    above code will create a GSUB table containing three lookups as follows, which
    appear in the order in which they are defined (implicitly or explicitly) in your
    code:\r\nlookup1 {\r\n    sub a by b;\r\n    sub x by y;\r\n} lookup1;\r\nlookupA
    {\r\n    sub c by d;\r\n} lookupA;\r\nlookup2 {\r\n    sub a by c;\r\n} lookup2;\r\n\r\nFeature
    tag xxxx will specify that lookup1 and lookupA are to be applied.\r\nFeature tag
    yyyy will specify that lookup2 and lookupA are to be called.\r\n\r\nThe fact that
    the call to lookupA appears <em> after </em> the line <code> sub a by c; </code>
    does not override the fact that lookupA has been defined <em> before </em> lookup2
    in the feature file.\r\n\r\nSo, if you apply feature yyyy to the string 'abc'
    the output will be 'cbd' rather than 'dbd' since it is the order of the lookup
    definitions, not the order of the lookup calls which is relevant.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
