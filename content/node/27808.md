body: Hi have decided to teach myself Fontographer. I have the manual and am working
  through it slowly! When your image is pasted into the template layer how do I know
  how the size of the caps and lower case in relation to each other? All my charaters
  are the same size to begin with, but if I scale in the template layer do I scale
  them all? How do I know where in the template box to position the character? Yes
  this is basic, thanks.

    get the metrics window which will show you your charaxters next to each other.\r\n\r\nAre
    you pasting into the template layer so you can draw the character in Fontographer
    ?. cos you could paste directly into the outline layer\r\n\r\ns."
