    they render much more quickly by not forcing the entire page to reload. Any <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/rapier/&sample_text=Gamblin%20&sample_size=130\">custom
    sample</a> is still linkable. On any search result page, package page, or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/rapier/\">single
    font page</a>, just change your sample and click the \"Link to this Custom Text\"
    or copy that underlined link."
