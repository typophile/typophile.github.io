  \ The logo is for a local music-venue and bar called \"the bottleneck.\"  They book
  punk, indie, rockabilly, etc. and wanted a rustic, beat-down, Midwestern look.  My
  inspiration was old letterpress ephemera you see in the area.  \r\n\r\nWhat do you
  think?  Please feel free to point out specific flaws as well as your general feeling
  and which one is your favorite.  I could use all the help I can get!  \r\n\r\np.s.--
  ignore the fact that none of them say \"The\".  Thanks!"

    somewhwat unbalanced: try getting rid of the blocks behind the Upper Right logo,
    and kerning the N closer to the B. Also, this may be due to personal taste, but
    I find the exclamation point to be a tad cheesy (especially in a logo). If they''re
    drawing Indie acts, the exclamation will  on serve to compromise the audience''s
    perception of the venue (and their ability to pull legitimate shows).'

  body: "Well, thanks Vince, but honestly I want them to continue to hire me for all
    their graphics needs.  Those are awesome posters though!\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    critique, JS!  I don't think they're having any problem booking shows with the
    current AWFUL logo they have, but they are hoping to bring back the hippest kids
    who have moved on to other venues as their identity has started to age and look
    90's.  I'll play around with the tweaks you suggested.\r\n\r\nAnyone else?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey Jeff,\r\n\r\nfor what it's worth, I think it's a good concept, I think
    the blocky ones on the right are definitely stronger, the letter-press look is
    more obvious, the others have a bit more of the ransom note thing happening, ot
    as desirable ;) I have two suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. integrate the B more, I just
    keep seeing the capital B, it's really dominant and everything else fades into
    a block. I think it's OK to lead with it but at the moment it seems to be doing
    its own thing. B square. \r\n\r\n2. Very clean looking letters for letterpress...
    without going grunge crazy, I would imagine a bit of dirtying it up wouldn't go
    astray, nothing wrong with a few printing artifacts, it's a rock and roll club,
    subtlety isn't so much required.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm not so sure about the 3dness
    of the letters, might be a little too busy for a logo, I hope these thoughts help,
    like I say, fair enough concept that will look good with just a bit more work\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: "Thanks all,\r\n\r\nnicholasgross:\r\n\r\n1. I agree entirely.  I'm hoping
    that when I add the \"The\" part I can integrate the B as part of that.  I have
    some sketches, but it does need to be addressed.\r\n\r\n2. Definitely part of
    the plan.  I thought I'd show them just straight vector logo mock-ups for today's
    meeting but integrate a distressed look for the final.  Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\naluminum:
    \ God I wish!  They're too damn cheap.  But I do think they'll hire a local GOOD
    sign painter for the exterior signage so that will be sweet.  I'll upload pics
    when it is all said and done.\r\n\r\nThanks again!  Anyone else?\r\n\r\n"
