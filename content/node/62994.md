  body: "sorry about the title.\r\n\r\ni dont think it is Century Gothic because ive
    tried that and there is a tiny gap between each letter, or do you think it was
    made in photoshop 1 letter and a time and merged closer to close the gap, does
    that make sense ?"

  body: "That's negative spacing. You can do that in almost every design-application
    like InDesign, Quark or else. Even in programs like Word. But it looks awful \u2026"
