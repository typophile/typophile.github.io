body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nA friend ask me something that I'm not sure and need some help
  from typophiles...\r\nHe wants to produce a book of logos of a special field.\r\nDoes
  he need written permition (from the owner) to reproduce the logos on the book? The
  ideia is to sell the book and make money with it...\r\nDoes anyone here was involved
  in a book like this? Or knows some articles or discussion on this subject that can
  point me?\r\nDoes the other books with 1.000's of logos or more ask each owner?\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
