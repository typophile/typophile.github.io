  origin of the different lowercase a's, as demonstrated in these examples. Does anyone
  know how we ended up with these two different shapes?"

  body: Those two on the right are based on Roman Current writing (that Futura is
    just upright version of the Italic), and two-storey a on the left has its origins
    in Capitalis Rustica and Uncial writing from fourth to sixth centuries, and later
    Carolingian Minuscule in ninth century.

  body: The "two-story" version (example the first) is more consistent with the Carolingian
    miniscule rendering of the letter a, while the "single-story" version (example
    the last) is consistent with everyday handwriting, at least as it was practiced
    under the Palmer method. The middle example extrapolates Palmer penmanship with
    sans-serif lettering.

  body: 'Oh, I always thought that the single story a (and g) in Futura derived from
    fraktur, but then again, since the structural basis of fraktur and italic is the
    same, this comment might just be a matter of semantics. '

    bad: when applied to lettering, it's minuscule vs. majuscule vs. miniscule (which
    simply means \"tiny\"). Storey or story depends on whether you use British or
    American spelling."
