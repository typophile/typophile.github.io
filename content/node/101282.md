  body: Most of this is Telugu script, but the bit in the lower left is Tamil. A few
    of the signs appear to be written backwards. My guess based on the layout is that
    this is some kind of magical or divinatory table.

  body: "don't think it is Hebrew or Sanskrit, nor is it Celtic... so that rules out
    most formal religious contexts... and I don't think any of the Mayan cultures
    used symbols such as these. What seems to remain is more occult or fictional language
    symbols... btw, it's not masonic, either...\r\n\r\nUnless I miss something from
    history books (entirely possible), me thinks tis a prank... or extra terrestrial
    ? "

  body: No, Michael, not extra terrestrial. I am 100% sure that it it Telugu, with
    a Tamil caption in the lower left. These are both scripts with which I am very
    familiar.

    being a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantra>yantra</a>, which is close
    to a divinatory table."
