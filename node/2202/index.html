		<div class="commentbody">Caps at the beginning of sentences have the functionality of marking when once sentence ends, and another begins. In 'chatting' people generally do one or two sentences at a time, so the differentiation is already marked by the exchange, and caps don't help further. But in continuious text like this, they are very functional. You could do away with this use of caps by adding extra space between sentences, but this would not save space, as the Swedish official wanted to.  <BR> <BR>In capitalizing proper names, you give the readers the signal that if the name is not important to them, they don't have to slow down to read it. So it is functional too.  <BR> <BR>I don't know whether the noun caps in German are a benefit in German and what their impact on English would be.  <BR> <BR>How to capitalize titles is also currently in flux, and I could see this changing, as it is not really an issue of functionality.    <BR> <BR>I was interested to read in one of Giampa's links on the 'Bauhaus' thread that they were opposed to caps, as well as serifs.  <BR> <BR>To a great extent their ideas have been tested over time. Sans serifs have succeeded in titles and display, but not in small solid text. And caps have not been abandoned. I personally think that this is not conservatism, but that the scribes who evolved these conventions - like the lower case letters themselves - were on to what is really functional. <BR> <BR>I think that those who don't use caps in continuous text either don't understand their functionality, or can't be bothered to hit the shift key to help their reader.</div>

Patiently I was waiting for the obvious Bauhausian conclusion that all books  should be made out of fibreglass. <BR> <BR>What make me sick is this incredible learning disability that everyone seems to have become afflicted. I can see that it is becoming contagious. Please don't sneeze in my direction! <BR> <BR>Good old fashion serifs and traditional typography has fared us well for more than five hundred years, but now, it seems to be impairing &quot;typographers&quot; ability to read. This ailment may require serious medication. Perhaps less vanity and a good pair of glasses.  <BR> <BR>Stop deamonizing good typography. If you are having trouble learning you are just going to have to study harder. The answer is not  to make bigger type, or remove capitals, or remove &quot;humanizing serifs&quot;. The answer is that you are a slow learner, blind or, not paying attention. Or the more obvious. <BR> <BR>So go to bed  drink plenty of fluids and pick up a good old fashioned reading habit.  When was the last time you read Moby Dick? <BR> <BR>It is not necessarily life threatening. Good literature, unlike fire extinguishers, or poultry do not have expiry dates. Your only danger is that you may learn that caps and serifs are not going to make you grow warts. <BR> <BR>So stop believing horned rimmed morons that do not know how to put their pinky on the shift key.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>And since caps only take up only about 5% of text (although double to triple that in German)&hellip;</i> <BR> <BR>Unlike lowercase letters, the frequency of caps depends very much on the nature of the text being sampled, <i>e.g.</i> something written in the first person is likely to have a high incidence of uppercase I, while something in the third person might have few or even none. Similarly, if a document makes reference to many proper nouns &ndash; people, places or organisations &ndash;  or uses acronyms, it will have a higher frequency of uppercase letters. When I was sampling texts for average English letter frequency, I deliberately ignored uppercase letters, because including them distorted the frequency more than excluding them. <BR> <BR>I initially thought that it would be essential to sample uppercase letters in German frequency analysis, but I was surprised by just how low the frequency of uppercase letters <i>compared to lowercase letters</i> is even in German. Sampling the same text in English and German translation &ndash; a Bible text of 30,000+ words, including a lot of proper nouns that bumped up the average uppercase letter count for the English &ndash;, I found that in the German the uppercase letters only accounted for 3.7% of the total alphabetic characters. I think the frequency of uppercase letters in German is often overstated.</div>

I think that the period is too small to do it by itself.

Armenian has problems too (like an overly homogenous x-height region), but only [part of] 8 million people use it. Let's work on the big clumsy one first. <BR> <BR>&gt; Enough for what? <BR> <BR>I guess &quot;enough&quot; isn't a good qualifier - it's all relative, after all. Compared to Morse Code for example Latin is wondefully diverse. But compared to Hangul it's a village idiot. <BR> <BR>So my &quot;enough&quot; might mean &quot;not as mush as it could&quot;. Why do you think dyslexia is much more common in Latin-using countries? It's pretty obvious for example that: <BR>1) Some groups of letters (like b/d/p/q, and h/n/u) are too similar. <BR>2) The vertical space is poorly used. Compare the descender and ascender space for example: the former has much richer shapes, but is used a lot less. All the ascenders except the &quot;f&quot; are sticks. And one of the letters (el) is just a stick by itself. <BR> <BR>The fact that laymen get along &quot;just fine&quot; and don't realize the problems means very little. That's a bit like saying we don't need airplanes. <BR> <BR>&gt; She knows her capitals, but can't recognize all her lowercase yet. <BR> <BR>A fine example of how <i>not</i> to teach the alphabet&hellip; <BR> <BR>Yeah, let's first learn the letters that are used for 5% (or a lot less) of text, since the Romans were such fine people and all&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Sometimes they would write along two diagonals as well as left to right. If the most important thing is to save paper.

As a consequence my posting followed your posting. That hour of day in Finland is not similar to yours. It was late for me in Finland. The final thing I did was hit the post button, turn off the office lights and go read a book. I was not aware of the unfortunate sequence until reading your posting this morning. <BR> <BR>It would be nice if this Forum system allowed for a review of &quot;new almost simultaneous postings&quot;. As you know, it does not. I am not the first one to have this experience. <BR> <BR>My reference is about apparent difficulties typographers are having reading. The apparent confusion they seem to have about the alphabet in general.

		<div class="commentbody">Let's be realistic. If there were no &quot;idiotic ads&quot; in newspapers, there would be NO newspapers, and the same goes for magazines. Publishers don't crank this stuff out because they feel it their duty to keep us informed. It's money. <BR> <BR>Certainly we could remove most of the problem of paper waste if the publishers of material on glossy and clay coated paper would desist. I know the world would be a better place for it.  <BR> <BR>In British Columbia it is now a very widespread practice to recycle paper (and all materials like metals and plastics that previously went into land fills). The clay-coated papers, that incidentally create bucks for graphic designers in the form of annual report work etc., dont recycle worth a damn. <BR> <BR>Decades ago when I worked on newspapers, there was a shift from 11 pica columns to 10 picas and 9 points. The reason was that they saved about 3/8&quot; in width on every newspaper roll, and that translated to many tons of paper each year. The newspaper carried on skinnying up the columns ever couple of years by three points or so until they dailies were down to 10 pica columns. Eventually they furnished all of the Linotype machines with a more condensed typeface, and in a  smaller size of 9 point rather than the previous 10 point. These apparently minimal measures saved the publisher lots of money in paper because the paper could order narrower rolls. I am certain their concern was with their bottom line rather than leaving a tree for a bobcat to climb. <BR> <BR>I have to say, as other have, that eliminating capital letters seems like an ineffective way to save paper . . . but who knows what if anything is going on in the brain box of any politican? <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR></div>
