body: "A while back someone was asking about what accent marks were needed for different
  languages.\r\n\r\nWhile many excellent and comprehensive resources were suggested
  in that thread, I've encountered one more:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6451/Extended%20Latin%20Alphabet%20Coded%20Character%20Set%20for%20Bibliographic%20Use%20%28ANSEL%29.pdf]]\r\n\r\nThis
  concerns a character set devised for libraries to print catalog cards for their
  collection of books which may include books in different languages. So it may not
  include some less widely used languages, and for those it supports, it may include
  only the bare minimum of accents, conflating similar accent marks from different
  languages, so as to achieve bare legibility despite very strict limitations in how
  many graphics were available (this is for the physical print train and daisywheel
  days).\r\n\r\nDespite this, it is possible this might be a helpful resource in addition
  to the others mentioned such as old specimen books; it is done from a different
  perspective."
