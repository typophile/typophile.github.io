  body: Thanks for the fast response Patricia! However, I&#39;m looking for something
    even a bit more similar. The most distinctive aspects, I think, are the &#34;B&#34;,
    and the below-center cross bars on the &#34;A&#34;, &#34;E&#34;, &#34;F&#34; and
    &#34;H&#34;. I&#39;ve been using these to make comparisons.

  body: You&#39;ll need to extend Elegant slightly - the sample you posted is rounder,
    but otherwise really close.
