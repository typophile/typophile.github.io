body: "It seems to me that this is something that is likely to already to exist, so
  before I ask someone to write it for me, I thought I would enquire if anyone already
  has it...\r\n\r\nI'm working on a font that contains a large number of glyphs with
  very slightly different stem weights, e.g. straight vertical stems whose widths
  vary from 259 to 264 units. I want to harmonise these stems so that they are all
  the same width, so what I'm looking for is a script that will take an input stem
  width and convert it to an output stem width. Obviously, the script should distinguish
  vertical and horizontal stems. This is similar to some of the functionality of KLTF
  Glyph Tweaker, except I'm looking for something that will find the glyphs which
  need to be adjusted as well as performing the adjustment."

    I can see how what I'm looking for would form part of such a thing. I just want

    Chris. I want to check first to see if anyone has already made such a thing. If
    not, I'll likely hire Karsten to produce one: he does most of my Python scripting,
    and I reckon he has already solved most of the problem in his Glyph Tweaker tool."

  body: Adobe's PS autohinter already does a decent job of identifying stems and recording
    their width, quite good enough for this purpose. So let's say that the PS autohinter
    has been run, and the hints are present in the FL glyphs. All I want to be able
    to do is say take any stem that is e.g. 262 units wide and make it 261 units wide
    by shifting some points. Okay, so a decision needs to be made about whether to
    shift them up or down, left or right. I reckon the safest bet will be to shift
    them from the centre of the glyph outwards, i.e. increasing the size of counters
    while preserving sidebearings and vertical alignnment zones.

  body: "For my immediate needs -- now met, I think --, the stems at issue are mostly
    straight and mostly vertical (primary stems in some North Indian scripts). No
    serifs.\r\n\r\nI can imagine how much more complicated it would get if one needed
    to deal with serifs or other terminal appendages, and things like S curvatures.\r\n____\r\n\r\nWhich
    led me today to another thought...\r\n\r\nOn the Web and some other publishing
    platforms, we now have a fairly cleanly defined distinction between content and
    display, between tagged text and information about how to display that text. [Yes,
    a lot of people still muddy the distinction in practice, but the point is that
    it is possible to do it cleanly if one is willing to think systematically and
    take advantage of the distinction.]\r\n\r\nSo today I started thinking about a
    parametric approach to making glyphs -- and could be extended to hinting glyphs,
    come to think of it -- that would mirror the XML/CSS approach to text creation.
    The 'content' of such a system would be sub-glyph elements -- stems, bowls, serifs,
    counters, etc. -- which could be tagged according to type and function, e.g. 'main-vertical',
    'diagonal-hairline' etc.; like XML tagging of text, it would be extensible, so
    the exact set of tags needed would correspond to the nature of the design intent,
    i.e. what the designer would express in terms of the content tags would be the
    meaningful distinctions to be differentially handled in the display. The 'display'
    is the parametric rules applied to the content, e.g. the stuff that says how thick
    and how long a 'main-vertical' stem should be, where it starts and terminates,
    how it interacts with adjoining bowls and their own display parameters, etc. Then
    the actual glyph creation would be performed by the equivalent of a CSS parser,
    a program that knows how to interpret and apply the display parameters to the
    tagged content. If all parts of the system are open source, then the parser can
    be updated to understand new parametric rules.\r\n\r\nDoes this all make sense?"

  body: It does. This seems where more recent developments in CJK formats/tools are
    heading. They go a step farther, leaving the conception of outline plus hinting
    behind (it is really time to forget about soft fabric plus shoulder pads underneath)
    and turn to a conception of shape-defining framework plus muscles (think of a
    more recent Illustrator <a href="http://vimeo.com/16856820" target="_blank">drawing
    tool</a>). Not even such new conception, btw. In the latter case, both framework
    and muscles could be classified/named for the sake of changing of parameters globally.
    And indeed it were nice if this were not just a production but an end format so
    that no conversion is necessary. The sfnt structure of OpenType makes it easy
    to plug whatever alternative table(s) for outline description into a font.

    compass and brains of TT, and a label, which is already done, no need to convert
    anything or make your own interpreter, besides freetype. The biggest barrier to
    all this working simply, efficiently and losslessly is that the geniuses at FL
    will not make the 1/2 hour change to the tool so TT outlines  can be edited on
    an equal basis with T1. Unfathomable ba-lindness to the future and going on  5
    years old ;)"
