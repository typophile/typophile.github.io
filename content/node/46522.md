    Down Below]] from Nick's Fonts.\r\n\r\nI've just tried out the previously suggested
    Popups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANSWER_6140.gif]\r\n\r\nIt
    doesn't look quite as sharp but is otherwise a very good match. Perhaps they used
    Popups but re-drew it to look sharper?\r\n\r\nAlthough looking at both, neither
    seem to have got the prismatic effect to work on the W properly!"
