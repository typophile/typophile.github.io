		<div class="commentbody"> I knew I couldn&#39;t have too much hope of not seeing this already done. Though, from the smallish previews of Extra that I could find I do think that I&#39;ve got some substancial differences. Like mainly I&#39;ve stuck to the block more on certain characters &#40;J, L, T, and especially I&#41; which was something of a debate for me as the original concept was blocks with only the smallest of cuts to make them ledgible &#40;and wasn&#39;t too worried about ledigbility at that&#41;, but obviously more traditional character widths/cuts could be good for those characters. But maybe now I&#39;ll just stick to the block for better or worse. <BR> <BR>hrant, your :-&#40;  I&#39;m translating as </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> I&#39;m actually not sure which is better/worse, and I don&#39;t want to discourage you. As long as you know what else is out there, and you make your own thing &#40;mostly&#41; independently, and the process turns you on, that&#39;s plenty. Hopefully it will turn other people on too, and maybe you could sell it better than FF? &#40;Although that would be hard.&#41; Type history is littered with plagiarism but also coincidental similarities. For example there&#39;s a part in Alexander Lawson&#39;s incomprable &#34;Anatomy...&#34; where Zapf expresses surprise at the similarity of Optima to a much older design by Middleton - but compare how the two designs fared on the street. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although it is similar, and in some ways very similar, I also think it can be seen as very different. I prefer the rigidity in Mitchell&#39;s. And if I really wanted a &#34;phat&#34; face with more roundness, I would use font bureau&#39;s <A HREF="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1039728523390289&amp;fontname=Asphalt" TARGET="_blank"> Asphalt</A>. <BR> <BR>The character&#39;s with any kind of counter-like space &#40;or counter&#41; seem to be a different weight than the others. That would be one critique from this corner. i&#39;m not sure i like final solution for you &#39;J&#39; either. The idea is nice but the solution isn&#39;t completed. :/ <BR> <BR>All in all, I do like it ... but, Hrant and Stephen&#39;s points &#40;perhaps&#41; shouldn&#39;t be ignored. See this as a challenge Mitchell and make it your own! Go Team!</div>
