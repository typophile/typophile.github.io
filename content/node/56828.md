body: "Yesterday I was working on an OT font and double checking some kerning. In
  the metrics window kerning shows up as it should. It has a generated kern feature
  which I can turn on in the OT preview panel.\r\n\r\nWhat I noticed that was weird
  is kerning worked everywhere except letters kerned to the cap A in the OT preview
  panel. I even muddled through the kern feature code to check and it shows up there
  and generates with kerning. It just won't preview anything kerned to A. I wondered
  if it has something to do with A being the default first character."

  body: Its not. In the metrics window letters kerned into the A have a blue line
    mark showing the kern distance. They preview fine in the metrics window. The only
    place they don't is in the OT features preview. All other kerning shows up except
    letters kerned to A. It hasn't been a problem since I know the kerning is there,
    its just weird it doesn't show in that one preview window.

  body: "There is probably a check box somewhere in the preferences that says, \"Show
    kerning with cap A in preview window\" that's not checked. (Kidding.) \r\n\r\nAre
    you using class-based kerning? If so, it may be that you have \"A\" in more than
    one kerning class. (Although, usually there is a warning about this when you compile
    the OT features.)"

    I might have to go with your first suggestion ;-)

  body: Make sure that your class definition is set up with single straight quote
    and not with an apostrophe. Text in the classes menu is so small that they end
    up looking alike.
