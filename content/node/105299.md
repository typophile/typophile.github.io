  there is growing frustration amongst designers in korea caused by 'Korean typeface
  companies\".\r\nThey are sending legal notices to design companies and clients demanding
  more fees or penalties for 'using their typefaces for \r\ncorporate and brand logos
  without signing an additional agreement and more fees in accordance to a new rule'
  that they instilled\r\na couple of years ago. This means they are paying an additional
  fee and sign another licensing agreement if we use it for a logo even if they have
  the original license for the typeface.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they are getting these
  notices for cases as far back as 6-7 years ago when they didn't have this 'new rule'
  in place.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know anything about this? I suspect that the EULA's
  are in Korean, so as a non-speaker i can't get much further.\r\n\r\n"
