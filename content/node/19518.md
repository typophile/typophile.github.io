    to postings... as I have posted dozens of times previously with no problems and
    now out of no-where this error message?\r\nThats why I wondered weather or not
    something had changed?\r\nI also dont understand what you ment by their second
    posting?\r\n\r\nAnd how do you configure a directory???\r\n\r\nBut I dont have
    that installed as im not really interested in viewing bandwidth hungry animations
    with no real practical value.\r\n"

  body: "I don't understand anything about the creation or maintenance of a website,
    however Flash Player is required to upload images. The method for posting images
    has changed recently(ish), but I couldn't tell you why, it's all a dark art to
    me. And it seems to have generally affected typophile.\r\n\r\nI meant that although
    posters have had trouble posting an image in their initial post when they create
    a thread, they seem to be able to post an image in their second (or later) post
    to that thread, give it a go.\r\n\r\nTim"
