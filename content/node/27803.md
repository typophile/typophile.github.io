body: "Hello there, I realise this may have been covered numerous times but  am looking
  for an elegant serif typeface for use alongside a family coat of arms. \r\n\r\nThis
  has to ooze elegance and quality and from a design perspective, include some beautiful
  curvature, but not appear too 'fancy' for want of a better phrase. I have in mind
  upper and lower caps in use as oppose to sentence case, but am open to suggestion.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is greatly appreciated as always.\r\n\r\nR."

    body: "Hi, Chris,\r\n\r\nIt's a British Coat of Arms, but the typeface I seek
      isn't for use in this, it is for all accompanying literature, I'm basically
      branding various pieces of collateral, and need to create a style.\r\n\r\nYou
      know for their stationary etc etc etc. I have always admired Trajan but am looking
      for something fresh for me to use!"
