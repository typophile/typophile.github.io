  body: "Hello, John.\r\n\r\nYes, I can give you a screenshot. I've been doing some
    experimenting in Word (yup) and the issue arose when I wanted to use what Word
    calls \"contextual alternates\", ie. italic Cyrillic letters [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic#Differences_from_other_Cyrillic_alphabets|different
    from Russian ones]]. In order for that to work, I had to pick as a language the
    most bizarre thing ever <em>Serbian (Cyrillic, Serbia and Montenegro (former))</em>
    and then select standard ligatures and contextual dialogues in Font properties.\r\n\r\nThis
    is what I get\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/this_3991.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    question is: how does one get the correct italics and correctly combined diacritics
    with capital Cyrillic letters?"

    the cap versions of above combining marks for subsequent positioning when preceded
    by an uppercase letters is not mapped to the feature in the Serbian 'SRB' language
    system. So far as I can tell, this only affects the Italic and Bold Italic fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for catching this. I'll get this logged as a bug and will send a fix to Microsoft

    of the original ClearType font collection, only Cambria, Calibri and Consolas
    were extended and mark positioning added for Windows 7.\r\n\r\nI don't know how

    other fonts <em>without mark-to-base GPOS support</em> in order to be able to
    create precomposed diacritic composites using these glyphs. It would be possible
    to do the same thing while leaving these glyphs unencoded, but that would result
    in a bigger fail when these characters occur in text, since the font wouldn't
    be able to display them at all.

  body: "Sylph: <em>Also, in Cambria, is the Combining Ring Below supposed to look
    like this?</em>\r\n\r\nWhat is happening here is that the GPOS mark positioning
    is moving the mark beyond the OS/2 table usWinDescent value. This means that the
    mark will be clipped in some software, but not in others. If you are using MS
    Word, you can prevent this from happening by using an exact size of linespacing
    in the paragraph settings, rather than a multiple of the default linespacing.\r\n\r\nIn
    Michel's image, I'd say that the position of the mark under the default italic
    <em>\u0434</em> is a bug. Probably my fault, I'm afraid. I think the mark height
    must be inherited from the upright font, where it needs to be lower because of
    the descenders of the \u0434."

    to do a better job avoiding clipping of marks above than below. Testing the sequence
    you show, less of the ring is clipped as the linespacing gets larger, but obviously
    this isn't a viable solution.\r\n\r\nNote that this clipping should not occur
    when you print the document, including printing to PDF: it is the result of how
    Word paints each line of text on screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not able to reproduce
    the problem you show with Calibri \xE0 vs \u0430\u0300: these display identically

    1877. And Microsoft introduced the above listed Latin script symbols with diacritics
    only when they introduced these two typefaces. But for Cyrillic almost 130 years
    after the introduction they still don't work."

    Based on the kind of issue that have met the bar for a Windows Update font update
    (for example new currency symbol support requested by governments) I don't think
    this is likely. But thanks again for reporting these issues. Of the billions of
    people who use Cambria and Calibri every day you are the only person to reach
    out and report these problems. Thank you!"

    who want to stay within the "rules". At least on Windows installing additional
    fonts doesn't require any jail-breaking.
