body: "Hey Gang,\r\n\r\nFontalicious is finally back up on the interweb thanks to
  the boys at Font Bros.\r\n\r\nOver the next few months, we'll be rolling out a cornucopia
  of delicious new typefaces for you to enjoy! Come check out the latest batch today.
  Some are free, some not so free!\r\n\r\nHere's a little list to get you started:\r\n\r\nWordsworth-
  Is it handdrawn? Is it vintage? Is it free? These questions can be answered by clicking
  on the font link!\r\n\r\nBlonk is fat and trendy, Blingo is the closest thing to
  owning millions of dollars worth of blood diamonds, except for without the blood
  and without the diamonds!\r\n\r\nGringo is a chubby little squatty cartoony body,
  and Brute is just like it sounds- rugged and smooth.\r\n\r\nKravitz Rounded is a
  newer, rounder version of Kravitz family, hence the name.\r\n\r\nDer Weiner Stentzel
  is a new twist on an old fave- GO FOR IT!\r\n\r\nA few other new fonts to be introduced
  in the next few days, just getting all the curtains dusted off first.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontalicious.com\r\n\r\nWelcome
  back!\r\nBen"

  body: I just clicked the link and all I got on Fontalicious.com is the squatter
    search page. Is this a premature announcement or just that DNS update propagation
    delay that sometimes happens?
