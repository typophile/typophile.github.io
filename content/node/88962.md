    Emigre has become a lot more flexible around font embedding in places like PDFs
    and Flash files recently, compared to the past when they were much more protective.  '

    biz long enough to know if Emigr&eacute; has been parsimonious with their licensing
    terms in the past - but unless I'm mistaken, this is the first \"name\" font maker
    that's shipping EOT and WOFF files for self-hosting, flat-out, no strings attached.\r\n(There's
    the fontfonts thing but don't you have to host with Typekit or something for that...
    gotta go check.)\r\n\r\nI might just spend a few bucks and see the quality of
    what I get.\r\n\r\nAnybody know of anybody else licensing like this, except the
    vendors at Fontspring?"

    \r\n\r\n\"Listening to the Web Fonts panel discussion seemed like I could have
    been at a conference for musicians and composers in which a panel from Napster
    was telling us how exciting it was now that they could make all of our music available
    for free! Every time they said web fonts, I kept hearing \u201Cfree font.\"\"\r\n\r\nJeff
    Keedy in August 2010 at TypeCon\r\n\r\nto <A HREF=\"http://www.emigre.com/WebFonts/Keedy\">this</A>...

    font\" ;-)\r\n\r\nAlthough he's just one of many designers represented by Emigre.
