		<div class="commentbody">Italy uses Traffic Type Spain? That's funny! ;-)
Do you know if this is the official name and the official typeface? Or is »Traffic Type Spain« just a similar commercial version of the original typeface? (Like Interstate is for FHWA fonts)



About Spain I just found this statement:
»En España, según la norma 8.1-I.C, se deben usar dos tipografías que se adjuntan dimensionadas con la norma. Para la señalización en autopistas, autovías y vías para automóviles, se utilizará el alfabeto denominado Autopista; mientras que para las carreteras convencionales, el entorno urbano y el resto de vías se usará el alfabeto Carretera Convencional.
Exiten versiones comerciales de las dos fuentes. La versión del alfabeto Autopista es la fuente Highway gotic, y del Carretera Convencional es Traffic Type Spain1 .«

Can anyone help to translate?
I guess it means they use a font called »Autopista« (based on Highway Gothic) and font called »Carretera Convencional« which is equal to »Traffic Type Spain«. Correct?

here is the translation of what of the spanish text you posted.
"In Spain, according to the 8.1-I.C law two typographies are to be used. For signage on highways, freeways and normal car-roads (i'm not sure about the technical differences among these kinds of roads) the Autopista font will be used. For conventional streets, urban sorroundings and the rest of the streets the Carretera Conventional font will be used. 
Commercial versions of those fonts can be found. <strong> Highway Gothic is the Autopista's commercial version of the font, while Traffic Type Spain 1 is the Carretera Conventional's version</strong>."

Usually, the  national traffic authorities publish all the information about signs and typefaces on their websites, but it's hard to research this stuff, when you don't speak the language ... Therefore I couln't figure out Italy, France, Poland and many more.

The fonts are made available for AutoCAD. I couldn't find an official reference to the typeface's name, but the PDF instruction file mentions 'JAE - Fonte'. Considering the examples available on the website (sample below), this might as well be the same typeface used in other european countries, or an adaptation of it.

I confirm that on the Italian "Street regulations code" the name of the font used for signs is not mentioned. 
Only a specimen is available, and the font is always referred to as positive or negative "alphabet".

The font is Traffic Type Spain D.

I also found out that in some rare cases the Transport is used, but that does not happen on highway or freeway signs.

		<div class="commentbody">La storia è un po’ complicata e confusa. La segnaletica stradale & autostradale si basa su convenzioni (relativamente) internazionali, che riguardano anche il carattere. L’Italia dagli anni sessanta ha adottato il carattere disegnato (dal 1957 al 1967) appositamente per l’uso stradale in inghilterra. Il progettista che ha disegnato la segnaletica e il carattere in uso è Jock <a href="http://www.designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert">Kinneir</a> (e Margaret Calvert), il carattere è appunto il <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/familytree.html">Transport</a> (URW, 1980).
La normativa della segnaletica italiana (quanto mai deprimente) si trova in qualunque edizione completa del <em>Codice della Strada</em>, che la riporta integralmente con tutti gli alfabeti prescritti. L’avevano fatta certi ingegneri del Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici, dei quali uno forse si chiamava Cecilia.
Il sistema progettato da Kinneir e implementato nel 1963 è un segno di durabilità stilistica. Anthony Froshaug, in un <a href="http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-09-1/contents">articolo</a> chiamato “Roadside traffic signs” (originariamente pubblicato nella rivista inglese <em>Design</em> No. 178, 1963), provò che non c’era ragione alcuna per un miglioramento del suddetto sistema di segnaletica esistente.
Le targhe automobilistiche italiane sono progettate dall’<a href="http://www.ipzs.it/scheda_prodgraf_ocv_en.jsp">IPZS</a>, l’Istituto Poligrafico.
Nella primavera del 2003 a Milano la Triennale ha ospitato una <a href="http://www.triennale.it/triennale/sito_html/asfalto/">mostra</a> molto interessante dal titolo “<a href="http://architettura.supereva.com/sopralluoghi/20030324/">Asfalto</a>, il Carattere Della Città”.

		<div class="commentbody">ok, here is the translation:

"The story is a bit complicated and confused. The road and highway signage is based on relatively international standards, that also involve the fonts to be used. From the beginning of the '60s Italy used the font designed (from 1957 to 1967) specifically for street signs in the UK. The designers of the sign layouts and the of the font in use are [[http://www.designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert|Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert]], and the font is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/familytree.html|Transport]] (URW, 1980).
The laws on Italian signage (quite depressing) are on any complete edition of the Italian "Codice della Strada" -Manual of road laws and rules, that has specimens of all the alphabets to be used. Some engineers from the Public Works Department, one of which maybe was called Cecilia, worked on it.
The system designed by Kinneir and implemented in 1963 is an example of stylistic durability.
In an [[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-09-1/contents|article]] called "Roadside traffic sign" (originally published on the British magazine Design No. 178, 1963) Anthony Froshaug proved that there was no reason for an improvement of that signage system.
The Italian license plates are designed by the [[http://www.ipzs.it/scheda_prodgraf_ocv_en.jsp|IPZS]], the Istituto Poligrafico.
In Spring 2003 the Triennale in Milano hosted a very interesting show called "[[http://architettura.supereva.com/sopralluoghi/20030324/|Asfalto]], the character of the city".


in my researches though, i found that [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=traffic+type+spain+d |Traffic Type Spain D]] (from an unknown designer), as it appears here is a lot closer in look to what appears on the Italian highways than Kinneir's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/d-bold/|Transport]], (1957-67), even in its [[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tss/workingdrawings/alphabet/|Heavy]] variant.
what my opinion is, is that the font that is being used took its shape from Kinneir's original design (the similarity with it is out of doubt), but was redrawn and applied without consideration of what were the lighting and optical problems concerned.

i will let you guys (that for sure have a lot more typographical experience than i do) judge these images, but please let me know your opinions!
a.

		<div class="commentbody">I am not going to burden you with all the data I have on this – some of it you don’t want to see. Just one example below:
A gentleman called Nathaniel Porter has digitized Transport Heavy, and it is being used by various agencies. The data is even worse than the Swedish Tratex font which must have been done by an amateur on on Ikarus system without corrections. This one here is just a raw scan. Amazingly, it works as a font. Too heavy for signs, but just shows how good font software has become if it can actually make a working font from a scan that looks like a piece of German rye bread.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/transport_a_6105.gif]

The other illustration is from a project I have been working on for the European Community. It won't be ready for a while – these things take forever and will be tested by the same people who are using Transport Heavy by Mr Porter. I still have to make different bitmap sizes and, thanks to Bitfonter and Adam Twardoch, these will actually be fairly legible. All the other dynamic signs in Europe use bitmaps that have been generated automatically from DIN, Transport or whatever they use in the countries.

The official Spanish Transport Heavy has decent outlines, why would anybody use an ultra bold weight, especially for white out of blue? There are no counters left.

In that period URW++ digitalized many European road sign typefaces under request of their signmaking costumers.

Unfortunately at URW++ there aren't any more information information about the source, the specifications or the designer of Traffic Type.

Don't worry – this is only for the electronic signs, what they call Variable Message Signs. I designed the bitmaps before the outline version. That one will be used as headers or other permanent stuff on the display boards.

I would hate to lose the variety on Europe's roads, even though most of the type is bad. But it's still typical for each country.</div>

That makes a lot of sense Andrea.

Spandex also had Transport available for their Gerber plotters in the UK in the early 80s.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4B_4348.jpg]
I seem to recall the fonts were over £100 back then, they came as EPROM modules. I think you could install about six in the 4B.

My office still has one tucked away in the shop. Ran like a tank, but it could only handle 200 characters at a time. The fonts came on chips that plugged into the board. you're right, it could hold six. The day we "went metric", I found you could convert the machine to metric by flipping two tiny switches inside... The result was metric equivalents of imperial units. So I switched it back and we stayed with imperial.

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>For signage on highways, freeways and normal car-roads <b>(i’m not sure about the technical differences among these kinds of roads)</b> the Autopista font will be used. For conventional streets,</cite>

Basically, the autopistas and autovías are what in the US would be called Interstates.  They are the roads which are designated with either an A (Autovía, such as A-6) or AP (Autopista, AP-41).  The primary difference between these roads is the design standards (APs are newer, with easier curves and more straight areas with better on and off ramps) and that the Autovías are free to use, while the AP charge tolls.  Carreteras are equivalent to US-highways or state roads, and are designated with an abbreviation for the province plus a number (e.g. M-30)

The MAIN difference I've seen between the two fonts used in Spain is that Autopista (the font) uses a straight bar tilde over the N in Ñ, whereas the Carretera Convencial uses the squiggly tilde and that Autopista tends to be spaced a little bit looser.

		<div class="commentbody">I would say it is not Transport (an official version of which was never relesased for use outside of Great Britain, except for Letraset films), but one of the many copies we can find around the world.

Unlike the Italian Transport, though, this version of Kinneir’s alphabeth seems a lot more freely interpreted, still keeping many similarities with that design.

The most curious aspect of these signs is, in my opinion, the Greek version of the Transport, designed to work with the Latin one but used in a different color and placed on separate signs…probably a bit confusing for drivers!

Does anybody have more precise information about this Greek “Θϱανσποϱτ”?

p.s. Great picture by the way!</div>

Core, actually Interstate is the name of Tobias Frere-Jones’ 1993-4 type design.
The alphabeths in use in the US highways are called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FHWA_Series_fonts|FHWA Series fonts]].

And for what concerns Portugal’s street and highway signs: another “clone” of Kinneir's project, this time not only concerning the font in use, but also the arrows and the layout (together with, it seems to me, the font used for the numbers).

Here are some pictures, fresh from my trip to Porto!

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Just to add some more information on some previously mentioned points:

*  It seems to me fairly obvious that Carretera Convencional, the typeface which is officially specified for direction signs on ordinary roads in Spain, is derived from Kinneir's Transport typefaces.  However, I have no direct proof that this is the case.  As noted, the stroke width is heavier for Carretera Convencional than for even Transport Heavy.  Also, the capital letters and lowercase letters with ascenders are designed to be in a 4:3 ratio to the lowercase loop height, which matches that of Autopista and, for that matter, all of the FHWA alphabet series.  This ratio is convenient for design of Spanish traffic signs since it allows a 3/4 size to be used for less important destinations and for parts of long destination names.  Examples include "Pola de Siero," where "Pola" is at the <em>altura basica</em> (basic height, often written "Hb" in Spanish construction documents) while "de Siero" is at 3/4 of the basic height, or "Torrelavega" at 3/4 the basic height on a sign where "Lugo" is in the basic height.  (North American signing doesn't vary letter sizes to nearly this extent--the main use of the 4:3 ratio is in defining interline spacing on guide signs.)

*  Spain carried out a major revision of its standards for traffic signing in 1992.  There have been further changes since then, but none related to typefaces (the biggest change came in 2001 with the current version of Norma 8.1-IC, which eliminated the green background for <em>vía rápida</em> signs).  The 1992 reform introduced Autopista and Carretera Convencional.  Before that time (if the 1986 official catalogue of traffic signing can be trusted, a doubtful proposition since it is clearly not 100% pattern-accurate), there was a typographical distinction between ordinary and high-standard roads similar to that which exists now, but the typefaces were different.  Spain used the old French L1, L2, and (I think) L3 typefaces for ordinary roads, and probably straight Series E Modified (not Autopista) for high-type roads.

*  Old French L1, L2, and L3 are not to be confused with modern L1-L4.  Modern L1 and L2 are essentially the same typeface, with stroke widths varied to accommodate contrast reversal.  The same is true of L3 and L4, which are an italic typeface derived from (I think) Roissy or some other similar Frutiger-designed type.  On the other hand, old L1 is essentially the same as modern L1, but old L2 is a more condensed version of old L1 (i.e., letters are thinner), while old L3 is a serif typeface which in France was generally used for tourist signing but also appeared on <i>autoroute</i> signs.

*  It has, in the past, been possible to obtain copies of the Portuguese traffic sign typefaces which are not oriented toward use with CAD packages.  They are available in TrueType format, with filenames 1n_.ttf (JAE - Fonte Tipo 1A Negativa), 2pf.ttf (JAE - Fonte Tipo 2A Positiva), 3n_.ttf (JAE - Fonte Tipo 3 Negativa), and 3pf.ttf (JAE - Fonte Tipo 3 Positiva).  They used to be included in the old JAE typeface installer, which was freely downloadable from the Web from the Estradas de Portugal site (in an earlier incarnation) and had the filename ABCTIPO.exe.  Unfortunately this distribution no longer seems to be online, though I think it may be recoverable through the Web Archive.

*  Theodore Watson Forbes is commonly associated with the FHWA alphabet series, but strictly speaking he was only the co-author of a key paper in 1950 which demonstrated the viability of using mixed-case legend consisting of Series D all-uppercase and the lowercase letters of what eventually became Series E Modified.  This was for overhead signs only at first.  The uppercase letters of Series E Modified were developed separately, to allow button reflectors to be fitted to the letters on ground-mounted signs (the overhead signs were, at that time, illuminated but not retroreflectorized).  The combination of the fat uppercase letters and the lowercase letters was a later development.  Initially Series D was used with the lowercase letters at a 3:2 height ratio, versus the current 4:3 ratio.  I have seen no direct evidence that Forbes designed the lowercase letters which were tested in his paper or even chose them from vernacular usage, although loose claims to this general effect have been made in the current edition of <em>Standard Highway Signs</em> and by the designers and testers of the competing Clearview typeface.  The real reason Forbes is venerated as the god of US highway signing is that, in the late 1930's/early 1940's, he wrote an important paper relating the minimum height of legend to be used on a sign to the intrinsic legibility of the typeface used, the amount of legend on the sign, and the speed of traffic going past the sign.  American guide signs continue to be designed to Forbes' conservative assumption that drivers need to be able to read a sign <em>twice</em> in the time that it is visible to them.

*  Mexican traffic sign typefaces give the impression of being at least loosely based on the uppercase-only FHWA alphabet series.  They are available in different levels of condensation, like the FHWA series, and there is just one series which has an accompanying lowercase alphabet, as used to be the case in the US prior to release of the Series 2000 alphabets.  Some of the letter and digit shapes are very similar, though not precisely identical.  The R in Mexican series tends to have a fatter and lower loop than the R in similarly condensed FHWA series.  Also, Mexican series count up with increasing condensation, instead of down as with the FHWA Series (Mexican series 0 being visually similar to FHWA Series E/F).  Dimensioned drawings of the letters are available in the Mexican <a href = http://dgst.sct.gob.mx/index.php?id=602><em>Manual de dispositivos para el control del tránsito</em></a>.

*  Peru uses the FHWA alphabet series without change, but follows Mexico in reversing the progression of the series identifiers.

*  As I understand it, only New Zealand uses the Transport alphabets, and only in limited contexts--usually signage for parking in urban areas.  Pattern-accurate dimensioned drawings for these are available in the <em>Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings</em>, and possibly also in the Land Transport Safety Authority's recently compiled index of traffic control devices.  I don't think the Transport alphabets are used in any of the Australian states, but I do not have complete information for all of them.

*  The position of South Africa with regard to typefaces is rather strange, since the country has changed its traffic signing system twice since 1950.  The pre-1970's South African system was essentially similar to Britain's pre-Worboys signing system.  Then, from around 1970 to around 1990 (I don't have specific dates), South African signing seems to have been similar to that used in modern Australia (FHWA alphabet series, but on British-style map-type signs).  This has since been abandoned in favor of a new system, now (in theory) rolled out to the other SADC member states, which uses the DIN-Schriften and borrows heavily from <em>RWB</em> and <em>RWBA</em> but has a multitude of details to meet specific South African situations.

Now, a question:  can it be fairly said that type conformity is generally poor in countries like Israel, India, China (including HK), and Greece where multiple languages are used with multiple scripts (not just Roman) on signs?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just got back from my first trip to Ireland, and I loved the face being used for the text in Irish as illustrated by Richard Hards months ago. So, I took the step of emailing Rennicks, and they promptly responded and described that face as:

Transport Heavy - Eire Heavy 10

Which makes sense, as it does appear to be more or less an "Irish" take on the standard Transport.

However, the person I talked to did not give any indication as to where the font could be purchased or even *if*; so, with that in mind, I thought I'd bump this thread in the hopes that either the information would help the curious or (even better!) help someone find it so that I could eventually get my hands on it as well.</div>

But I don't think the font is available to the public.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Ralf. I have an email out to transport.ie already, sent just before I contacted Rennicks; all appearances indicate that you are correct in saying that the font is likely unavailable to the public. I hold out some measure of hope nonetheless. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eriks, I was looking at the "Trans European road network dynamic signs" and I realized you mixed a lot of alphabets in there. You have Greek, Russian, Romanian and the alphabets used by some North European countries. Were you trying to get all the alphabets in one sentence?

		<div class="commentbody">Here is an example of an Egyptian road sign (written in a font derived from the British Transport, but with confusing widths and heights) — also the right diagonal arrows look pretty awkward and thick; I took this picture in Cairo last week.

And here is a picture taken in the Cairo Metro: not a street sign, but still uses the "Egyptian Transport"
