  painting, and one day about 25\u201330 years ago, while I was looking for porcelain
  mixing trays at the local art supply store, I noticed a stack of these \u201CLetraset\u201D
  catalogues. I was bored, so I picked one up, leafed through it, and noticed page
  after page of different types of letters. I had no idea there could be so many.
  And that was it. From that day on, I pretty much took that book with me everywhere
  I went. I covered it in clear packing tape to stop the wear, and I even wrote my
  name and telephone number on it in case I lost it, so some kind soul would return
  my valuable book to me. Believe it or not, I was a little awkward and nerdy as a
  kid. First, Favorite, Font,  true story.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tiger_5226.jpg]"

    shop was to set the type on a piece of paper, blow it up to the required size
    with a projector and roughly trace the characters on a large piece of paper. We
    used the 'slip-sheet' roll that came with the Amberlith to keep the gel side from
    sticking to the backer. Then I'd tape th the paper to a large table be clean up
    the tracing, making sure weights, cap- heights, x-heights, etc. were consistent
    and correct  and after that it's moved to a light table and cut. Garamond was
    a very satisfying font to cut. Every line and every shape somehow made sense and
    could be resolved with smooth, fluid and, I felt, very human gestures. \r\n\r\nChris,
