body: "Before my question let me state my assumption, which is that point size is
  measured from the highest point of the letters, usually the ascenders or in some
  cases cap height, to the lowest point, almost always the descenders. Further, punctuation
  such as apostrophes, quote marks, or accents, especially accents above caps, is
  not counted.\r\nI was experimenting with Times New Roman today (forgive me) and
  noticed that when setting 11 pt Times New Roman (Open Type) over 10.5, the ascenders
  and descenders do not meet.\r\nBy the math, shouldn't they? The highest ascenders
  do not touch the lowest descenders.\r\nIt must have an extremely small amount of
  extra space either above or below.\r\nIs there some other way that is happening?
  If it is an intentional design \"feature\", how common is it in typeface design?
  And is there a method to the madness?"

      fantastic. I would expect the horizontal lines that you added would touch just
      the tips of the ascenders & descenders. So does EB Garamond already have space
      built in above the ascenders (but, oddly, the descenders cross the line)?\r\n\r\nOn
      lines 6 and 7, the g descender looks like it would touch the d ascender. This
      collision is what I would expect from a \"36 point\" typeface set on 36 line-spacing/leading,
      although I don't understand why the horizontal lines are offset.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Brian, allow me to give you a straightforward explanation using a reference
    to metal type.\r\n\r\nPoint size is determined by standards: 12 point type is
    .166 inches high on a metal slug. In today's world that could be referred to as
    the total of the Ascent and Descent as measured from the baseline. For example,
    using an EM of 1000, you might set your Ascent to 700 and your Descent to -300,
    totaling 1000 in height. Consideration must be given as to how the font will be
    used in determining these values.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean, nor should it mean,
    that your Ascenders should be 700 and your Descenders -300. One must build in
    vertical white space so when typeset with solid leading there is still a tiny
    amount of space between the lines, that amount being the decision of the designer.
    Dependent upon the design you can also have the design overshoot the Ascent and
    Descent but I would only do that for display or special-use faces such as ornate
    scripts. \r\n\r\nThe design itself merely sits in the point size space, oriented
    to a common baseline. There are no strict standards regarding capital size or
    x-height, or for ascender and descender length in relation to the other glyphs.
    For design comparisons, use Helvetica and Futura, and Garamond #3 with Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    this is helpful to you. If not, ask more questions....   :-)\r\n"

    body: "George - Thank you. This makes a lot of sense and is how I understand it.
      I suppose that even with metal type, the ascenders and descenders would not
      have to take up the entire \"point size\". I just thought it was so standard,
      that everyone would want to. It seems that as Michel demonstrated, it can be
      whatever the designer wants.\r\nBut it seems like an easy enough system to follow.
      What would cause a designer to not follow that measurement method? Or is it
      that most do follow that measurement system, but there are a few oddballs. Even
      so, I wouldn't expect Times New Roman to be a dissident!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"point size is measured from the highest point of the letters\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    not correct. I'm a graphic designer so one of the typography experts here can
    correct me if I'm wrong, but it originally started in the days of wood and metal
    type when there was some additional space above and below each character, some
    built-in leading. This system carried over into desktop publishing.\r\n\r\nSo
    to make characters actually touch, you normally need to use leading that's smaller
    than the point size, such as 11' type with 10' leading.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type2_5983.png]"

  body: James - built-in leading, yes, this is exactly what I was wondering. For example
    it is visible beneath the y's. I'm sure that adds strength to any thin descender
    areas, so that makes a lot of sense. I guess then, I still don't see why someone
    would want to add auto-leading to a digital typeface.

    about typography sets a paragraph in an application with little or no typographic
    leading control and sets it up as single-line spacing, what is produced will have
    some appropriate white space between the descenders and the following line. Basically
    it's a fail-safe to protect the integrity of readability.

  body: "@Michel Boyer:\r\nYour illustration makes an important point that had been
    missed in this discussion so far.\r\n\r\nWith foundry types, many manufacturers
    settled on three positions of the baseline - a standard position, for typefaces
    with fairly short descenders, a \"script\" or \"art\" line for faces with long
    descenders, and a titling line, just slightly above the bottom of the slug for
    titling faces.\r\n\r\nThis allowed different typefaces to be mixed easily - if
    two of the typefaces used different baselines, some leading above the one and
    below the other would be needed to bring the baselines into alignment, but that
    leading would be an integral multiple of the point, or at least the half point.
    Possibly, for the smallest sizes of type, of 1/4 point.\r\n\r\nWhenever two typefaces
    with different baselines are mixed on the same line,  that means the line requires
    more space than the point size, as your diagram shows."

    Armenian. Armenian is slightly different, in that the baseline of capital letters
    is below that of letters within the x-height for the traditional faces.\r\n\r\nHebrew
    is treated as an all-caps face - and Quoph, at least, has a descender, which somewhat
    justifies that, but even it is outside the Western paradigm.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    speaking, though, the Latin alphabet is usually thought of as the paradigm of
    simplicity among scripts. Here, it seems to be the most complex.\r\n\r\nIn any
    event, it makes sense that printers, trying to print texts in the Latin alphabet,
    would deal with how to fit its letters on type - and leave other scripts for later.
    Yes, it's Western-centric, but what would you expect of Westerners? In the case
    of Chinese - one slaps the character on a type slug... they're all aligned the
    same way. So there is no separate body of complexity that needs to be reconciled
    with Latin-alphabet practice with careful thought - Chinese faces can just be
    treated as titling faces."
