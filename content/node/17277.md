  set the cropped image as your desktop background (or \"wallpaper\")\r\nd) amaze

  body: "Joe,\r\n\r\nThat looks really awesome.  I did something similar years ago
    in college. I had a textured yellow wall behind my CRT, so I propped up my flatbed
    scanner against the wall and scanned it, and used that as my desktop wallpaper.
    \ I didn't have to match up any cables, though."

    classic \"snaps\" of overlapping photos with live environments.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HP_printer-ad1.png]\r\n<em>Picshas,

  body: do you think they really used photos at all though? i thought they just used
    empty frames and "snapped" an instance and morphed it.

  body: "On the HP ads, they may have used a few \"real\" photos on group shots, but
    they probably did a lot of \"empty white frames\" and did most in post filming
    production.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the studio that did it <a href=\"http://www.toolofna.com/index_flash.html\"
    target=\"new\">\"Paranoid Projects\" :Tools of North America</a> out of Santa
    Monica.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to their latest <a href=\"http://www.boardsmag.com/screeningroom/commercials/2255/\"
    target=\"new\">HP \"Cafe Society\"</a> commercial, viewable in Quicktime, with
    a complete list of credits... I think they pride themselves on their \"picture-in-picture\"
    trickery and not about to give away all their trade secrets."
