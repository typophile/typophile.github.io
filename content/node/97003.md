body: "I'm looking for a font that emulates the text in old scholarly journals.  Here
  are a few examples of what I mean:\r\n\r\nhttp://dns2.asia.edu.tw/~ysho/YSHO-English/1000%20WC/PDF/J%20Ame%20Che%20Soc60,%20309.pdf\r\nhttp://rieke-server.physiol.washington.edu/People/Fred/Classes/532/hodgkin_huxley_jphys52d.pdf\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=wpU5AAAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&ots=Wt9EmkG6oo&sig=IgvHEGIS5s12OyikoCtP_pBRyms#v=onepage&q&f=false\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pnItAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&ots=GeNnwWDJPf&sig=18J1V3ThiMKFxUdDKNP73Un_u8A#v=onepage&q&f=false\r\n\r\nThese
  examples are actually kind of clean; something even more rough (but still legible)
  would be more preferable.  It's kind of hard to explain what I'm talking about,
  since I'm not well versed in typography lingo, but the fonts look rough, or not
  crisp, especially when you're zoomed out.  Like sometimes it seems as if some of
  the edges are almost missing or faded out.  That's the visual I'm going for.  Something
  that conveys that this is text made for a scholarly article, but that it is premodern,
  or precomputer at least.\r\n\r\nAre there any fonts like that?"

    But what's called the \"weathered\" (AKA \"distressed\", AKA \"grunge\") look
    you seek is independent of the genre (although historic styles <em>are</em> more
    likely to get that treatment).\r\n\r\nNot the best stuff, but:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/hand-stamped/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1820-modern/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/baselinefonts/momentum/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1805-jaeck-map/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "That \"distressed\" quality is an artifact of the scanning, not the printing.
    You are largely seeing the pixelation resulting from the low resolution of the
    scans. You could easily replicate this by choosing any font you like, printing
    something in it, photocopying it a few times (copy the copy repeatedly), and the
    scan it at a low resolution. You can probably also fake it in Photoshop etc.\r\n\r\nThe
    difference between the pages of the Jstor article is that the first page is a
    PDF generated directly in software with vector-based fonts, and the second is
    a PDF of a raster image scanned from paper. Make sense?"

    if this is mentioned in an FAQ somewhere (I looked, but couldn't find anything),
    but on there any tutorials on how to make a font from an image, i.e. if I wanted
    to use a low resolution scan of \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"
    to create a font so that I don't have to print and copy repeatedly for every piece
    of text I want to write."

    you want a certain style of font to come out a certain distressed way directly
    you'll need a font designed like that. Just asking: is it possible you might have
    a budget to have such a custom font made? If so there are a number of regulars
    here who can do it for you, including yours truly: hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    method.\r\n\r\n1. Rasterize the type as grayscale at 300dpi.\r\n2. Apply a Gaussian
    Blur of 3 to 8 pixels (depending on the font).\r\n3. Adjust LEVELS to pure black
    and white.\r\n4. Convert to BITMAP.\r\n5. Duplicate layer, and use DISSOLVE to
    add noise.\r\n6. Flatten and print.\r\n\r\nHave fun: this method is totally free.
