body: "Hi All!\r\n\r\nI met this beautiful, condensed italic font (serif, but not
  very much) in my (previous) paperback edition of [The Design of Everyday Things]
  (wonderful book, BTW); but I cannot exactly identify the font.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI've
  posted the question @ the WhatTheFont forum (myfonts.com), and got the answer I'd
  suspected I'd get: Palatino. Admittedly, the font looks very much alike, but there
  are some big differences...\r\n\r\nCutting to the chase, here is some imagery:\r\n<ul>\r\n
  \ <li>[[http://kelleyvanevert.nl/scratch/everyday-things-font/]], Some pages of
  the book, stolen from Amazon (see every page but the first..)</li>\r\n  <li>[[http://kelleyvanevert.nl/scratch/everyday-things-font/diff.png]],
  Major differences between italic Palatino and my italic font: capital M, lower f.
  Furthermore, the forms are less pronounced, and for example, the lower s is simply
  more \"squiggly\" than italic Palatino..!</li>\r\n  <li>[[http://kelleyvanevert.nl/scratch/everyday-things-font/elements.png]],
  The first of the three versions of the italic Palatino font, as found in [The Elements
  of Typographic Style], page 226, looks much more like my font than others..</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nBTW,
  after inspecting the book some more, I found that the italics in the new introduction
  don't exactly match the italics in the rest of the book (seen in above image). It
  indeed looks more like italic Palatino.\r\n\r\nSo what's happening here? I'm no
  font expert (far from), but I know common fonts like Palatino, having been around
  for some time, have some differences when digitized by differenct foundries, and
  probably even some historic differences. Am I looking at an older \"version\" of
  Palatino?, or is it simply another font?\r\n\r\nI'm pretty much blown away by the
  elegance of this italic font, I love the simplistic lower f, the parallel capital
  M, the general \"squiggliness\" and condensedness when placed between \"normal\"
  roman Palatino. ...so I'd really appreciate any help identifying it! How wonderful
  would it be to be able to use it myself :)\r\n\r\nCheers! -- Kelley van Evert"

    & /M/ glyphs.\r\nThe problem is, I can't find it on sale anymore from any legitimate
    source.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI found it using

    body: Closer, indeed, but still not it. The cap M is still a bit "slanted inwards",
      and, for instance, the lower s is still "too curly". Thanks, though :)
