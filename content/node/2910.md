body: Hey everyone. I don&#39;t like to hijack the Gen. Disc, board with personal
  topics, but I&#39;m not sure how else &#40;or where else&#41; to get this advice
  on sorting out this Typophile problem I&#39;ve got. <BR> <BR>I did the membership
  thing &#40;sign-up, PayPal, etc.&#41; for an Uppercase membership, and it all went
  through &#40;from what I can tell on my receipt&#41;. I did this on January 8th.
  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s now over 20 days and an email to both Joe and Jared &#40;as recommended
  by Troubleman&#41; later, and I still don&#39;t have access to the Uppercase area,
  or any response from Joe or Jared. <BR> <BR>Has anyone else had this experience?
  Am I too impatient? Is there something special I should do to make this work? I&#39;ve
  signed in and out multiple times, to no avail. I&#39;m still a typophile without
  UC access. I don&#39;t mind waiting, but the page says 4-5 business days for the
  account upgrade/ activation, and I&#39;m not getting any response as to why it hasn&#39;t
  happened yet. <BR> <BR>Any help would be greatly appreciated! I really like and
  enjoy Typophile, but I feel jilted. <BR> <BR>&#40;Thanks for tolerating my public
  plea.&#41;

  body: It&#39;s been 20 days. He&#39;s already practiced patience. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    ridiculous. It&#39;s not physical. There are no backorders. Give this man his
    access. <BR> <BR>Oh, and don&#39;t thank her for being a smartass.

  body: Easy, Eric. Some consideration &#40;but also from Jared &amp; Joe&#41; is
    a good thing. We&#39;re not Target expecting a delayed order from Merisel. <BR>
    <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: hmmm.  interesting.  I&#39;m not sure why there&#39;s a need to antagonize
    people who pay $40 for membership by demeaning them with &#34;we&#39;re not Target
    expecting .....&#34; but it does say Access is given in 4 - 5 business days.  I&#39;ve
    also contributed $40 and have not received a single response from three emails.   The
    money from Paypal was snapped up like a clerk at the counter without an eyeblink.  What
    are the procedures for a Return.  I think I&#39;d like my money back.  What seemed
    a warm hearted contribution has turned to ice.  I&#39;m inclined to agree with
    Eric Pitcock.  Please refund my $40 to Paypal.

  body: I hate the Simpsons. I also hated Forest Dump. They glorify idiocy. <BR>Beavis
    and Butthead were different though. They were just TOO dumb. <BR> <BR>&#62; Can
    you tell me how I get my $40 back? <BR> <BR>I have no magic bullet, but anyway
    I&#39;d rather you wait.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hey, let&#39;s have no <i>Simpsons</i> hating here. Or any hating, for that
    matter. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m willing to be extra-patient because I like Typophile
    so much and I can still use it on some level, and also because I don&#39;t know
    Joe or Jared at all. For all I know, one of them is trapped in the Himalayas after
    a plane crash, and the other is hiking up to get them and that&#39;s why they
    haven&#39;t gotten to it yet. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ll suggest here that they give
    themselves a longer window for activation and upgrading if they have difficulty
    delivering on their promise. It&#39;s just considerate. It&#39;ll also help ensure
    further user donations, since this <i>is</i> a user-supported site.

  body: I know when I paid up it took time o get my uppercase membership, but as typophile
    isn&#39;t kmart, I understand that independent websites like typophile are so
    good that they need to be given a chance to catch up with orders. <BR> <BR>Typophile
    has been so good for my type design...  <BR> <BR>Thank you!!! <BR> <BR>JIM <BR>---

    work here. =&#41; <BR> <BR>For that matter, nobody gets paid to work here. Users&#39;
    contributions and advertisers keeps this place alive. <BR> <BR>That said, this
    month we&#39;ve been very heavily focused on taking Punchcut from a part-time
    effort to our full-time studio. We regret relying too heavily on the good will
    of users who&#39;ve contributed financially and just want what they paid for.
    <BR> <BR>If you fit that category, and your account doesn&#39;t get upgraded to
    Uppercase by the end of today, please email me.
