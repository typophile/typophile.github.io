body: okay i get cheezed off when people wonder what font a company used for it&#39;s
  logo, but over the holidays i saw ketel one ads that were set all in the same font
  they use for their logo. i&#39;m figuring that it is a custom font that they must
  have had developed, but is there any chance that it&#39;s not?

    glad you beat <BR>me to it with a full alphabet image Justin. <BR> <BR>According
    to Luc Devroye&#39;s listing of fonts on the various Dover Dan X. Solo books/CDs,
    <BR>Bradley may be found on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0486999602/qid=1076285090//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-1448097-5990211?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"

  body: hey mike, what&#39;s this listing that you mentioned earlier about solotype
    fonts? i&#39;m looking for a font that was in his catalog that i&#39;ve been working
    on, nymphic &#40;maybe you&#39;ve seen my post on that one&#41; i keep hoping
    i&#39;ll find it in one of the dover font books, but no luck yet.

  body: Paul, <BR><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/fonts.html" target="_blank">
    Luc Devroye&#39;s font pages</a> are an incredible resource. Several of the specialty
    <BR>font link pages contain the listing you seek. <BR> <BR>Scroll down to the
    Dover Press entry on <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/fraktur.html" target="_blank">
    this page</a>, for example. The listing is <BR>for the books with CDs of 24 fonts
    only. Unfortunately, you won&#39;t find Nymphic <BR>listed. I would think that
    Nymphic &#40;&#39;tis a beauty, eh?&#41; would appear in one of <BR>those 100
    Fonts books of theirs, especially the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0486233022/qid=1076344340/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-1448097-5990211?v=glance&amp;s=books"
    target="_blank"> Victorian</a> one. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m the one who exchanged
    posts with you on MyFonts and via e-mail <BR>about Nymphic awhile ago. I&#39;m
    waiting patiently for your digitization! Perhaps <BR>Solotype will beat you to
    it, though, now that Mr Solo is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/solotype/?itemsperpage=29&amp;resultcount=29&amp;page=1&amp;mode=alpha"
    target="_blank"> releasing fonts</a> on <BR>MyFonts. <BR><br>

  body: oh hey mike! good to hear from you again. did you see my string on Nymphic
    letterforms elsewhere on this site? you can see what letters i have thus far there.
    i see that my fonts does have solotype fonts now, but i wonder if they aren&#39;t
    just the fonts that he released on his dover cd series. i haven&#39;t looked into
    it that deeply yet. i bought a couple of the solotype books on your suggestion,
    but unfortunately Nymphic wasn&#39;t in the 100 Victorian fonts book. So I&#39;ve
    been looking for someone who has an original specimen book that could scan it
    for me or something, so that one&#39;s on the back burner a bit. anyhow i&#39;ll
    keep you posted.
